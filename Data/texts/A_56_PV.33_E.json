Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-178. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n01-60873 (E)\r\n*0160873*\r\nPresident: Mr. Han Seung-soo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 25\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nDraft resolution (A/56/L.6)\r\nThe President: In order to expedite our work, I\r\nshould now like to consult the Assembly with a view to\r\nconsidering immediately draft resolution A/56/L.6. In\r\nthis connection, since document A/56/L.6 has been\r\ncirculated only this morning, it would be necessary to\r\nwaive the relevant of rule 78 of the rules of procedure,\r\nwhich reads as follows:\r\n“As a general rule, no proposal shall be discussed\r\nor put to the vote at any meeting of the General\r\nAssembly unless copies of it have been circulated\r\nto all delegations not later than the day preceding\r\nthe meeting.”\r\nUnless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees to consider draft resolution A/56/L.6.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/56/L.6.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/56/L.6?\r\nDraft resolution A/56/L.6 was adopted (resolution\r\n56/3).\r\nThe President: As a result of the resolution just\r\nadopted, agenda item 48, “Causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa”, originally scheduled for\r\nThursday, 8 November, will now be taken up on\r\nMonday and Tuesday, 3 and 4 December 2001.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this\r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 25.\r\nBefore we proceed further, I should like to refer\r\nto the general debate in the General Assembly at its\r\ncurrent session. As members will recall, at the 16th\r\nplenary meeting of the General Assembly, on 3 October\r\n2001, I informed representatives that the General\r\nAssembly will devote seven days instead of 10 days to\r\nthe general debate during the session — from Saturday,\r\n10 November, through Friday, 16 November, including\r\nSunday, 11 November. There will be two meetings a\r\nday, the morning meetings from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and\r\nthe afternoon meetings from 3 to 7 p.m. Consequently,\r\nthere will be 14 plenary meetings instead of 20, and we\r\nwill therefore have fewer hours for statements in the\r\ngeneral debate.\r\nAs I did at the 16th plenary meeting, I will again\r\nappeal to members to urge speakers in the general\r\ndebate to limit their statements to 15 minutes so that all\r\nthe speakers can be accommodated within those seven\r\ndays. I would be grateful for members’ kind\r\ncooperation.\r\nI should also like to inform members that list of\r\nspeakers number 5 for the general debate is now ready\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nand will be faxed to delegations some time today.\r\nCopies of the list are also available in room 2925.\r\nAgenda item 49\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe consideration in the plenary General Assembly of\r\nthe reform of the Security Council for several years\r\nshown that this is one of the items of the greatest\r\nimportance, but also of the greatest complexity, on our\r\nagenda. We know that under your leadership,\r\nMr. President, it will be possible to have a frank and\r\nproductive discussion that will lead us to a full\r\nconsideration of the central elements. This debate that\r\nmust be geared towards strengthening the Organization\r\nin order to provide it with a Security Council in which\r\nall Member States can feel duly represented.\r\nWe should like to begin our statement with a\r\nreaffirmation of the centrality of the question of the\r\nveto. This privilege, conferred on only five Members\r\nof the United Nations, has implications for the\r\nfunctioning of the Council and for the very possibilities\r\nof agreeing on reform. While we do not disregard the\r\nfact that there is a close relationship between the\r\nexercise of the veto or the threat of its exercise on the\r\none hand, and the functioning of the Council on the\r\nother, it is on the aspect of reform that we should like\r\nto share some brief thoughts.\r\nAs Colombia sees it, the question of the veto is\r\ntied closely to the subject of the expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Council. We believe it would be\r\ncontradictory to criticize this privilege, as we have\r\nbeen doing, and at the same time agree that there are\r\nsome States that might have sufficient credentials to be\r\ngranted the power to veto decisions in an expanded\r\nCouncil. Clearly, the existence of the veto, and the lack\r\nof political will to limit it, makes it even more difficult\r\nfor us to arrive at a broad agreement that makes it\r\npossible to expand the Council.\r\nNonetheless, there is general consensus that the\r\nexpansion should be in the category of non-permanent\r\nmembers. For this reason, progress in that direction\r\nwould enhance the legitimacy of the Council and its\r\ncredibility within and outside the United Nations.\r\nIn addition to the essential issue to which we\r\nhave just referred, there are some procedural questions\r\non which we should like to make a few comments.\r\nFirst, we favour intensifying the productive\r\ndialogue between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council on the item that is now before us. The\r\nexchange of views we had in June of this year in one of\r\nthe sessions of the Open-ended Working Group served\r\nto highlight the fact that non-members of the Council\r\nhave valid concerns about the Council’s activities and\r\nworking methods that should be duly considered by\r\nmembers of that body. This example should be\r\nfollowed during the meetings of the Working Group\r\nnext year. We wish to affirm, as of now, our readiness\r\nto participate once again and to contribute to the\r\nsuccess of that exchange.\r\nSecondly, we wish to emphasize that the Open-\r\nended Working Group continues to be the appropriate\r\nforum to discuss reform of the Security Council in all\r\nits aspects. Colombia believes that it would be\r\ninconceivable to create alternative forums in which\r\nonly a few would participate, when we have an open,\r\ndemocratic, transparent and representative mechanism\r\nto consider substantive items — cluster I — and\r\nprocedural issues — cluster II.\r\nSome will say that the Working Group has failed\r\nbecause there has not been any significant progress in\r\nthe reform of the Council. But the cause of this — if it\r\nis a fact — cannot be the format we are using in\r\nconsidering the subject of reform, but, rather, the\r\npernicious combination of the lack of realism in the\r\naspirations of some members and the lack of political\r\nwill to achieve reform on the part of others.\r\nAs elected members of the Council, we wish to\r\nexpress, thirdly, our commitment to do everything in\r\nour power to implement some of the suggestions that\r\nhave been made in the Working Group on procedural\r\nissues.\r\nJust recently, we have contributed to bringing\r\nabout the convening of the working group on\r\ndocumentation and procedures despite some\r\ndisagreement and reluctance on the part of some\r\nmembers of the Council and of prominent Secretariat\r\nofficials. We commend the courage and decisiveness\r\nshown by Ambassador Richard Ryan of Ireland,\r\nPresident of the Council during the month of October,\r\nin his efforts to bring about that meeting. We will try to\r\nensure that the opinions expressed by those who will be\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nparticipating in the debate on the report submitted by\r\nthat body to the General Assembly will be\r\nappropriately taken into consideration.\r\nI wish to conclude this statement by affirming our\r\ncommitment to the achievement of comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects. The\r\nnew structure of the international system and the\r\ncurrent nature of the threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity will give rise to tremendous responsibilities\r\nfor each of our States. It is a new context that requires\r\na more sound debate on the way of maximizing the\r\nlegitimacy and the representativity of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Satoh (Japan): At the outset, I would like to\r\nexpress my gratitude to the former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the\r\nleadership he demonstrated on Security Council\r\nreform. I also thank him, Ambassador De Saram of Sri\r\nLanka and Ambassador Ingólfsson of Iceland for their\r\nefforts in preparing the comprehensive report.\r\nWe are now experiencing changes of great\r\nmagnitude in international politics. In the aftermath of\r\nthe terrorist attacks against the United States on 11\r\nSeptember, nearly all States Members of the United\r\nNations condemned these acts of terrorism and have\r\nbeen engaged in various forms of cooperation,\r\nrecognizing that efforts to bring to justice those\r\nresponsible for the attacks should be given highest\r\npriority on the international political agenda. This fact\r\nsymbolizes a new trend in international cooperation.\r\nTerrorist acts per se are not new phenomena.\r\nHowever, the events which took place on 11\r\nSeptember, by the viciousness of their means and the\r\ngreat number of their victims, have shown us, in an\r\nextremely cruel manner, that eliminating the threat of\r\nterrorism is the most urgent issue in international\r\npolitics. Thus the countries of the world have come\r\ntogether to work towards their common goal of\r\neliminating terrorism. The fact that 171 representatives\r\ncondemned terrorism in their statements before the\r\nGeneral Assembly clearly demonstrates the magnitude\r\nof the outrage of the international community at these\r\nterrorist acts.\r\nTerrorist acts are different in character from both\r\nconflicts between States and internal confrontations,\r\nand the associated violence. It is said that one cannot\r\nremain neutral in the face of terrorism, but, on the\r\nother hand, defining terrorism is not an easy task. It is\r\nespecially difficult to prevent terrorist acts, because\r\nterrorists are not easily distinguishable; in many cases,\r\nthey are unidentifiable. However, the attacks of 11\r\nSeptember have shown us that terrorists can plot\r\nattacks against States which are similar in scale to a\r\nnational military operation.\r\nFor this reason, the international community\r\nneeds a new focus and new measures to deal with\r\nterrorism. Focusing on the financial resources of\r\nterrorists and promoting intelligence cooperation on\r\nterrorists are pertinent examples of this new approach.\r\nIn addition, the possibility of terrorists’ using nuclear,\r\nbiological, or chemical weapons is becoming an\r\nincreasingly realistic topic for discussion, and this\r\njustifies the importance of making anti-terrorism\r\nmeasures a priority item on the international political\r\nagenda.\r\nWhat I have mentioned so far has significant\r\nimplications for Security Council reform, which is the\r\nagenda item we are considering at today’s meeting.\r\nFirst, as is evident in its resolution 1373 (2001), the\r\nSecurity Council must focus on an ever-wider range of\r\nareas. In order to decide on how to counter global\r\nterrorism effectively, the Security Council requires\r\nknowledge and expertise in a wide variety of fields,\r\nranging from internal security to international\r\nfinancing.\r\nSecond, as is also implied in Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), in order to ensure the\r\nimplementation of resolutions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil, the cooperation of all Member States is\r\nrequired in a broad range of areas, including domestic\r\nmeasures such as consolidating laws and systems for\r\nmonitoring and regulating cross-border movements of\r\npersons, goods, and even financial resources, as well as\r\nintelligence cooperation in various fields.\r\nI recognize that at present the Security Council is\r\ndoing its best to tackle these new challenges. However,\r\nthis does not diminish the importance of realizing\r\nSecurity Council reform as early as possible. On the\r\ncontrary, the need to strengthen international\r\ncooperation to fight terrorism underlines the\r\nimportance of accelerating our efforts for Security\r\nCouncil reform by casting light on the issue of the\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Council from new\r\nangles.\r\nThis is not the only reason why Security Council\r\nreform is necessary. Looking back at the activities of\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nthe Council in the 1990s, we note that the scope of\r\nperspectives and the variety of human and material\r\nresources required for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security have already expanded, and, indeed,\r\nwill continue to expand. The peacekeeping operations\r\nof the United Nations, for example, are not only once\r\nagain increasing in number, but their mandates are also\r\nexpanding to cover broad areas ranging from the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-\r\ncombatants, as seen in the case of Sierra Leone, to civil\r\nadministration and development, as witnessed in\r\nKosovo and East Timor. The Security Council has also\r\ncome to be concerned with such issues as humanitarian\r\nassistance, particularly for refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons, and HIV/AIDS.\r\nMoreover, as we look ahead to the future, when\r\nthe Security Council considers the issue of realizing\r\ndurable peace and stability in Afghanistan, which is\r\nclosely related to the counter-terrorism measures we\r\nare engaged in now, it is clearly important to examine\r\nthis issue in a way that envisages the political stability,\r\neconomic and social reconstruction and development of\r\nAfghanistan, in addition to relief for refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons — an issue which has\r\nalready become serious.\r\nOn the other hand, it goes without saying that, as\r\nseen on the Korean Peninsula and in the Middle East,\r\nthe world is not yet free from military standoff’s and\r\nvicious cycles of violence, which have persisted since\r\nthe Cold War era. There are still no prospects for a\r\nsolution to the Iraqi issue. And there are conflicts in\r\nAfrica which are yet to be resolved.\r\nConsidering these expanding responsibilities of\r\nthe Security Council, it is imperative that the\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Council be\r\nenhanced through its reform. This is necessary because\r\nthe present composition of the Security Council does\r\nnot reflect the reality of today’s international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe discussion on Security Council reform began\r\nin 1993 against the backdrop of the growing mood to\r\nsearch for a harmonious world order, prompted by the\r\nend of the cold war. However, the discussion has not\r\nyet shown any sign of progress, despite the fact that it\r\nhas entered its eighth year. This situation is very\r\ndisappointing to many countries, particularly since, in\r\nthe course of the debate at the Millennium Summit and\r\nthe General Assembly last year, it has become apparent\r\nthat the great majority of Member States affirmed the\r\nnecessity for Security Council reform.\r\nI would therefore like to emphasize the\r\nimportance for all of us to tackle the issue of Security\r\nCouncil reform with renewed enthusiasm and resolve,\r\nat this time when a trend of new international\r\ncooperation is growing in international politics.\r\nOn the closing day of the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the former President, Mr. Holkeri,\r\noffered three suggestions on how to move Security\r\nCouncil reform forward based on opinions he received\r\nfrom Foreign Ministers of Member States in response\r\nto his own initiative. They are to move the discussion\r\nto a higher political level; to approach comprehensive\r\nreform step by step; and to make the question of the\r\nveto part of these discussions. We believe that these\r\nsuggestions merit thorough consideration.\r\nIn particular, we consider it advisable to focus\r\nour discussions on the question of the size of the\r\nexpanded Council as the next step in a step-by-step\r\napproach towards the attainment of a final reform\r\npackage. Furthermore, although this is a proposition to\r\nbe taken up in the future, in the event concrete progress\r\ntowards Security Council reform is not seen ten years\r\nafter deliberation on this issue began, we believe it\r\nwould be worthwhile to consider creating an\r\nopportunity for the political-level representatives of\r\nMember States to assess the work that has been done so\r\nfar and to seek a way to move forward.\r\nIt is the mission of all Member States to give\r\nshape to the enthusiasm shown by Member States for\r\nSecurity Council reform at the Millennium Assembly\r\nand to move our discussion forward to that end. In\r\nrecognition of this fact, the Government of Japan will\r\ncontinue its efforts to advance our discussion on\r\nreform, cooperating with many other Member States\r\nthat share the same view. In that effort, I respectfully\r\nrequest the understanding and support of Member\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): Our\r\ndebate on Security Council reform comes this year at a\r\ntime marked by the growing discontent and sensation\r\nof frustration numerous delegations feel with regard to\r\nthe Council. In a time when all institutions have striven\r\nto adapt to a new international reality, the Council still\r\nstruggles to find its identity and genuinely embark on\r\nthe road to reform and change. It is a time when those\r\nsame delegations are ever more vehemently expressing\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\ntheir wish for the General Assembly to recover its lost\r\nprerogatives and take its proper place at the heart of the\r\nOrganization that gathers us here.\r\nThe discussions we have engaged in for the last\r\neight years, which, over the years, have lost the fire\r\nthat once nourished and the spirit that sustained them,\r\nhave not led so far to any tangible result concerning the\r\nenlargement of the Council or to any appreciable\r\nimprovement in its functioning. This state of affairs is\r\nessentially explained by the fact that — despite the\r\nupheavals and transformations in international relations\r\nin recent decades, due in part to the arrival on the\r\nworld scene of dozens of new independent nations —\r\nthis Organization and its principal organs continue to\r\nfunction according to the logic and constraints of a\r\ngeopolitical order belonging to a past age.\r\nThe Security Council is at the centre of our\r\nsystem for collective security. It is the place where the\r\npositions, concerns and interests of the powerful\r\nnations are expressed and occasionally clash.\r\nAccordingly, the pressing need for Council reform\r\nposes a formidable challenge and a test of the\r\ndeclarations of intent made by our heads of State, at the\r\ntime of the Millennium Summit, on strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations. The measures envisaged included\r\nthoroughgoing Security Council reform and the\r\nreassertion of the General Assembly’s central role as\r\nthe United Nations principal deliberative and\r\nrepresentative organ.\r\nWe should recall that the importance and\r\nsensitivity of the question of Council reform was\r\ndemonstrated once again by the great number of\r\nspeakers who took the floor during last year’s General\r\nAssembly debate; the vast majority of them agreed in\r\nrecognizing, as does Algeria, that the Council, created\r\nimmediately after the Second World War, no longer\r\nreflects the geopolitical realities of today’s world and\r\nthat its structure and methods of operation should\r\ntherefore undergo a thorough transformation if it hopes\r\nto continue carrying out its international\r\nresponsibilities with complete legitimacy and the\r\nrequired effectiveness.\r\nImproving the functioning and working methods\r\nof the Council responds to a concern for its\r\neffectiveness and transparency. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the increasingly active role of the\r\nSecurity Council in the prevention and settlement of\r\ninternational crises and conflicts. We also note with\r\nsatisfaction that the Council has introduced some\r\npositive measures to lend greater transparency to its\r\nwork, particularly in opening briefings by the\r\nSecretariat to all Member States. We nevertheless\r\nbelieve that it is necessary for the Council to finally\r\ngive definitive form to its rules of procedure and to\r\ninstitutionalize the arrangements regarding the various\r\nmeasures it has already taken to enhance transparency\r\nand its working methods so that the positive changes\r\nthat have been made are not subject to the will of a\r\ngiven President or other member of the Council.\r\nHowever, we note with regret that closed\r\nmeetings ─ in which all the important issues are dealt\r\nwith and where decisions affecting Member States are\r\nin fact taken — remain the normal practice, even\r\nthough, to the contrary, those meetings should be the\r\nexception. We also note that those who hold the\r\nexorbitant power of the veto increasingly determine the\r\nfinal outcome of the Council’s deliberations in advance\r\namong themselves. In addition, my delegation would\r\nlike to express its regret regarding the fact that\r\nalthough the Council should, in conformity with\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, act according to the purposes\r\nand principles of the Charter, some members of the\r\nCouncil sometimes act as if they had in mind only\r\ndefending and promoting their own national interests.\r\nMoreover, my delegation would like to stress in\r\nparticular the need for the Council to provide in the\r\nreport it presents to the General Assembly by virtue of\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, a timely, detailed, complete\r\nand analytical account of its work — and not simply a\r\ncompilation, as was again the case this year. That\r\nshould enable Member States to determine the extent to\r\nwhich the Council has been able to take into account\r\nthe resolutions of the General Assembly in the\r\ndecisions the Council takes on the issues that fall under\r\nthe competency of both principal organs, as well as the\r\nsuggestions and proposals made by Member States\r\naimed at establishing more balanced, harmonious and\r\nfruitful relations between the two.\r\nMy delegation had hoped that, like the elected\r\nmembers, the permanent members of the Council\r\nwould also take part in the animated and substantial\r\ndebate that took place when the Council’s report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly was taken up. We would also be\r\ntruly pleased to learn from both permanent and elected\r\nCouncil members that this year’s debate did not leave\r\nthem indifferent and that it will have an effect on the\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nfunctioning of the Council and on its future relations\r\nwith the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation also believes that it will be\r\nnecessary for the Council to consult regularly and\r\ncontinuously with States directly and indirectly\r\ninvolved in conflicts discussed by the Council, as well\r\nas with regional and subregional organizations\r\nconcerned. The Council should also take measures to\r\ngive greater effect to Article 50 of the Charter, which\r\ndeals with the right of every State to consult the\r\nCouncil if it finds itself in a difficult situation because\r\nof a preventive or coercive measure taken by the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAlong the same lines, greater efforts should also\r\nbe made to involve troop-contributing countries in the\r\ndevelopment of the mandates for forces deployed by\r\nthe United Nations. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nCouncil’s adoption of a statement on cooperation with\r\ntroop-contributing countries so as to develop a new\r\nspirit of partnership, cooperation and trust.\r\nFinally, it would be advisable for the Council to\r\ndevote itself to carrying out its mandate according to\r\nthe Charter, and not to exercise any functions not\r\nexplicitly conferred upon it by the Charter. It is not the\r\nCouncil’s role to legislate; that is the role of States.\r\nNor is it the Council’s role to deal with economic and\r\nsocial matters; that is the role of the General Assembly\r\nand of the Economic and Social Council. The Council’s\r\nprimary responsibility is the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. That is a sufficiently\r\ndifficult, complex and demanding role, to which the\r\nCouncil should devote itself fully and without\r\ndistraction.\r\nWhat is nevertheless a cause of great concern and\r\nprofound frustration for my delegation is the total lack\r\nof progress on matters of substance. Whether with\r\nregard to the size and composition of the Council, the\r\ncriteria for choosing new permanent members or the\r\nquestion of the veto — to cite just a few examples —\r\nfar from the achievement of desirable compromises, the\r\ngulfs separating the various positions have grown and\r\nbecome more pronounced, with each country holding\r\non to its position and appearing unwilling to\r\ncompromise or demonstrate flexibility.\r\nThis state of affairs can be attributed, in large\r\nmeasure, to the particularly sensitive and complex\r\nnature of the exercise and to the significant stakes\r\nassociated with it. It is also due to our desire to\r\nundertake comprehensive and real reform of the\r\nCouncil. It should be underscored that this is also due\r\nto the lack of political will among a small number of\r\ndelegations that — in addition to never having made an\r\neffort to put forth ideas that would move the reform\r\nprocess forward — have for some time tried to blame\r\nthe blockage in the reform process on the working\r\nmethods of the Open-ended Working Group, whose\r\ntwo Vice-Chairmen, the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and\r\nIceland, I would like to commend for their competence\r\nand dedication. The Working Group’s methods are in\r\nfact no different at all from those of any other working\r\ngroup of the General Assembly.\r\nWith regard to the matter of the veto, my\r\ndelegation believes that it is intrinsically linked to the\r\nenlargement of the Council, the consideration of which\r\nremains at the heart of the problem of reforming the\r\nCouncil. My delegation fully endorses the idea backed\r\nby almost every delegation, which holds that the veto is\r\nanachronistic, discriminatory and undemocratic. That\r\nbeing the case, my delegation would like to see\r\nprogressive restrictions on this privilege, which should\r\nbe limited only to issues under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, until its total elimination. While we wait for\r\nthe exercise of this privilege from another age to be\r\nbetter regulated and then eliminated, we would hope\r\nthat, in response to the urgent call made by the rest of\r\nthe world, those who have the right of the veto would\r\nof their own volition demonstrate a pragmatic spirit\r\nand resort to, or threaten to resort to, the veto only in\r\nexceptional situations.\r\nWith regard to the matter of expanding the\r\nCouncil, my delegation believes that it is urgently\r\nnecessary to correct the current imbalance by ensuring\r\nmore balanced and equitable geopolitical\r\nrepresentation and by increasing the participation of\r\ndeveloping countries. In this connection, my delegation\r\nwould like to reiterate its support for the specific\r\nproposals made by the members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, in particular those proposals that have to do\r\nwith increasing the number of Council members and\r\nthat reflect the will to strengthen the effectiveness and\r\nrepresentative character of that important organ.\r\nLikewise, my delegation would like to underline\r\nthat any increase in the membership of the Council\r\nshould take into account the African position,\r\nformulated by the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) summit in Harare in 1999, that the Council\r\nshould be expanded by 11 seats, and that it would only\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nbe fair — since the African continent is home to the\r\nlargest number of Member States of the Organization\r\nand is the first priority of the Council — for Africa to\r\nhave, out of those 11 seats, 2 permanent, rotating seats\r\nwith the same prerogatives as other permanent\r\nmembers, and two non-permanent seats to be\r\ndistributed among African States in accordance with\r\ncurrent OAU criteria and elements that subsequently\r\nenhance those criteria. We believe that an enlargement\r\nof the Council to at least 26 members would give it\r\nmore legitimacy, a more representative character and\r\nheightened credibility, without diminishing its\r\neffectiveness in any way.\r\nThe frustration we feel at the slow pace of the\r\nreform should not deter us from preserving with\r\ndetermination to find the way to a solution acceptable\r\nto everyone; nor should it lead us to take a partial and\r\nhasty decision that serves to compromise the chances\r\nfor true Council reform.\r\nHowever, this kind of exercise should not go on\r\nindefinitely, because the status quo in the Council is, in\r\nthe final analysis, harmful to the Council’s action and\r\ncredibility, which it is in our fundamental interest to\r\npreserve, because the Council is for us all, large and\r\nsmall, the central pillar of our collective defence\r\nsystem. It is therefore the natural, sole recourse and\r\nframework for all action aimed at the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nI could not conclude without assuring you,\r\nMr. President, of my delegation’s full willingness to\r\ncontribute positively and constructively to the debates\r\non this important issue, which we hope will be pursued\r\nin a transparent calm atmosphere. For that, my\r\ndelegation believes that the Working Group is the\r\nappropriate framework in which questions of Security\r\nCouncil reform should be raised and addressed,\r\nquestions which remain the sole prerogative of\r\nMember States.\r\nMr. De Ruyt (Belgium): The events of 11\r\nSeptember and developments since then have squarely\r\nplaced the United Nations at the centre of world\r\nattention. In order to face these new challenges and\r\naddress the new demands of the international\r\ncommunity, it looks more and more obvious that our\r\nOrganization has to be adapted to the realities of\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nAs the body with primary responsibility for peace\r\nand security, the Security Council stands to profit from\r\na substantive enhancement of its representativity,\r\ntransparency and efficiency. It is our firm belief that\r\nthe events I have just referred to make our work on the\r\nreform of the Security Council all the more urgent.\r\nBelgium coordinates the activities of the so-called\r\nG10, a group of 10 countries that is also composed of\r\nAustralia, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal and Slovenia. Over\r\nthe years we have put forward realistic and operational\r\nproposals to reform the Security Council. Those well-\r\nknown proposals make it possible, in our view, to\r\nachieve a comprehensive reform package that is both\r\nreasonable and balanced.\r\nHowever, the discussions at the previous session\r\nof the General Assembly again demonstrated how\r\ndifficult it is to reach agreement on the delicate issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform. Progress on cluster I again\r\nproved elusive, in spite of some useful debates. Work\r\non the working methods was more productive. We\r\nwelcomed in particular the well attended discussions\r\nbetween the Open-ended Working Group and members\r\nof the Security Council. We look forward to similar\r\nmeetings at the next session of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the Security Council on its\r\nnew openness towards troop-contributing countries.\r\nYour predecessor, Mr. President, indicated from\r\nthe start of his mandate that he wanted to be actively\r\ninvolved in the work of Security Council reform.\r\nTogether with the members of the Bureau, he\r\nsteadfastly tried to make the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group more focused and productive.\r\nHowever, he could not but conclude that after eight\r\nyears of work the main issues still remained open.\r\nAs Mr. Holkeri correctly stated in his closing\r\naddress to the Assembly on 10 September, the main\r\nneed now is to move forward from discussion to\r\nnegotiation. This will necessarily entail showing\r\nflexibility and making compromises.\r\nAs the G10, we believe that further work can and\r\nshould be done in the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nHowever, a breakthrough will not be possible without\r\nthe clear political will of the members. This is why we\r\nshould not exclude, as Mr. Holkeri himself suggested,\r\nmoving to a political level at the appropriate time. We\r\nremain open as to the precise form this should take.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nFirst, however, we should redouble our efforts to\r\nfocus the work of the Open-ended Working Group,\r\nmoving forward where progress is possible. At the\r\nsame time, we should be careful not to lose sight of the\r\nfinal aim, which is a comprehensive agreement.\r\nIn the work on Security Council reform,\r\nMr. President, we seek your active involvement. In this\r\nway, you can help us intensify our effort in order to\r\nachieve a comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in all its aspects. My delegation and the other\r\nmembers of the G10 stand ready to assist you in your\r\nefforts.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): A year\r\nago more than 140 heads of State unanimously\r\nendorsed at the Millennium Summit the need to\r\nextensively reform the Security Council in all its\r\naspects, an objective that has not been an isolated\r\naspiration in our Organization’s history.\r\nThe Security Council acts by delegation and on\r\nbehalf of all Members. This presumes the exercise of\r\nshared responsibility and reflects the permanent\r\ninterest of all States to transform the Council into a\r\nlegitimate and transparent forum that responds\r\neffectively to the collective interest of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe first precedent for Council reform dates back\r\nto 1963, when, faced with a significant increase in the\r\nnumber of Members of the Organization, the General\r\nAssembly, by resolution 1991 (XVII) increased the\r\nnumber of members by five.\r\nMore than 30 years since that decision, and 8\r\nyears since the creation of the Working Group for the\r\nspecific purpose of re-evaluating the situation and\r\nproposing concrete action to improve the Council’s\r\noperation and membership, we see a discouraging\r\npicture: first, under-representation of the developing\r\ncountries in its membership; secondly, an unclear\r\ndecision-making process; thirdly, the exclusive\r\nconfiguration of a system of collective international\r\nsecurity that excludes the majority of members of the\r\nOrganization’s democratic organ — the General\r\nAssembly — from the decision-making process; and,\r\nfinally, the persistence of the anachronistic exercise of\r\nthe right of veto.\r\nIn this regard, the quagmire of the discussions of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group continues to be the\r\ncommon denominator, and the need for a re-evaluation\r\nof the Organization’s structure and functioning\r\nbecomes more obvious than ever.\r\nPeru does not wish to repeat once again its well-\r\nknown position on the characteristics that this Security\r\nCouncil reform should have. However, we do wish to\r\nreiterate our view on the issue of the veto — and only\r\nthe veto — precisely because we regard this element to\r\nbe the cornerstone of the reform process at the present\r\ntime.\r\nAt the 1945 San Francisco Conference, my\r\ncountry firmly upheld the inadmissibility of applying\r\nthis privilege to determining the existence of a threat to\r\nor a breach of the peace, to fact-finding investigations\r\nin cases of conflict and to amendments to the Charter.\r\nThe outcome is well known: the countries that opposed\r\nthe veto had to choose between a Charter that\r\ncontained this exception to the principle of sovereign\r\nequality of States as enshrined in Article 2 (1), or the\r\nfailure of the San Francisco Conference. I believe the\r\ntime has come to begin to correct this decision, one\r\nthat reflected a specific time in history but one which is\r\nnow in the past, because of the new shape of\r\ninternational relations today. We must, at least, limit\r\nthe exercise of the veto. The limitation of the use of the\r\nveto to decisions under Chapter VII of the Charter,\r\nwith a view to its total elimination, seems to be the\r\nconsensus of all States except for the Permanent\r\nMembers, and is in and of itself an important\r\nconcession by the large majority of member countries,\r\nwhich seek to take the first step in this process and go\r\nbeyond a mere unilateral commitment to self-restraint.\r\nAnd we have done this. If there is no agreement on\r\nlimiting the veto, we should, for the time being,\r\npromote the expansion in the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers and the enhancement of the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly with an expanded Security Council,\r\non the basis of clear and transparent criteria for action\r\nand linkage between these two bodies.\r\nAs regards transparency, Peru encourages and\r\nwelcomes the efforts at openness made in recent years,\r\nwhich have led to a larger number of open Security\r\nCouncil meetings, and the effort made by some\r\npresidencies to ensure that the opinions of non-member\r\nStates — in particular, of those States that are directly\r\ninvolved — be considered in the final result of Council\r\nmeetings. This is fine. We are convinced that this type\r\nof measure represents a direct contribution to the work\r\nand the efficiency of the Security Council.\r\nNonetheless, initiatives of this type remain to be\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nimplemented, as do others aimed at greater discussion\r\nand dissemination of the concepts of collective\r\nsecurity, as well as information on peace processes, in\r\na secure and invariable regulatory framework.\r\nIn this connection, we wish to emphasize in\r\nparticular the open debate on the strengthening of\r\ncooperation with troop-contributing countries, which\r\nled to the adoption of resolution 1353 (2001), which is\r\nalready being implemented. This resolution recognized\r\nthe importance of the participation of troop\r\ncontributors for the success of peacekeeping\r\noperations. This is a coherent, practical measure, as\r\nwell as a just recognition of those States that do\r\nparticipate in the riskiest stages of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nIn this same context of transparency, we also\r\nwelcomed the presence of Security Council\r\nambassadors in the Working Group on the reform of\r\nthe Council. This gave the Group the benefit of their\r\nexperience and, mainly, it made it possible to gather\r\ntogether and convey to the entire Council the\r\ncomments and suggestions that were made at that\r\nsession. We, therefore, encourage the continuation of\r\nthis exercise in the future.\r\nLastly, Peru reaffirms its firm will to continue to\r\ncontribute actively and constructively to this important\r\nsubject with the ultimate objective of shaping a United\r\nNations which is more equitable, fairer and more\r\ntransparent, for the benefit of all States.\r\nMr. Mahbubani (Singapore): Please allow me to\r\nbegin by both thanking and congratulating former\r\nGeneral Assembly President Harri Holkeri of Finland\r\nand Ambassadors John de Saram of Sri Lanka and\r\nThorsteinn Ingólfsson of Iceland for the good work\r\nthey have done. Under difficult circumstances, they\r\nhave done a sterling job. In particular, their initiative to\r\ncompile relevant excerpts from the work of the\r\nSecurity Council and of the General Assembly on\r\ncluster II issues helped to generate a more informed\r\ndiscussion. This is the good news.\r\nNow comes the bad news. Most diplomats obey\r\ntheir leaders’ instructions immediately. Collectively,\r\nhowever, we, the United Nations diplomats, have\r\ndecided to ignore our leaders’ instructions. Last year, at\r\nthe Millennium Summit, our leaders instructed us “to\r\nintensify our efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council in all its aspects”. This\r\ninstruction is simple and clear. We should reform all\r\naspects of the Security Council. However, the report\r\nsubmitted by the Open-ended Working Group suggests\r\nthat we remain on autopilot, obeying United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions rather than the\r\nMillennium Summit declaration. Hence, the first point\r\nwe wish to make in this debate is a simple one: let us\r\naim for comprehensive, not selective, reform of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nTo reform an institution, or indeed an individual,\r\nwe first have to understand the nature of the beast that\r\nwe are reforming. Probably very few of us understand\r\nthe real nature of the Security Council. Certainly, in the\r\ncase of Singapore, after serving 10 months on the\r\nCouncil, we are not sure that we understand its core\r\nessence well. Indeed, it is hard to find the right\r\nmetaphor for the Council. Perhaps it can be compared\r\nto a medieval castle with five traditional lords. Its job\r\nis to take care of peace and security in the global\r\nvillage. The villagers are allowed to elect 10\r\nrepresentatives to serve for two years on the castle’s\r\nhigh council. Hence, it is a partially democratic\r\ncouncil, but only the lords have decisive veto powers.\r\nAll this is well known. We are revealing nothing new.\r\nWhat is less well known is how the castle’s high\r\ncouncil arrives at key decisions. In recent years, the\r\nnumber of Council meetings has exploded. There are\r\npublic meetings; closed meetings; private meetings,\r\nwhich are sometimes open and sometimes closed to\r\nmedia and non-members; informal consultations, which\r\ntake up most of the time; Arria formula meetings;\r\nsanctions committee meetings, now coupled with the\r\ncounter-terrorism Committee meetings. Then, of\r\ncourse, there are the private meetings among the lords\r\nthat are not documented and the meetings of the groups\r\nof friends, which are equally opaque, with no trace of\r\naccountability attached to them.\r\nDespite the enormous importance of these\r\nmeetings, the Council has no agreed glossary of terms\r\nto describe the meetings. The Singapore mission has\r\nattempted to produce a glossary, which can be found on\r\nour Web site, but even our list is inadequate. Indeed we\r\nhave steadfastly advocated that the informal working\r\ngroup on procedures and documentation of the Security\r\nCouncil should meet more often. Here, I am glad that\r\nthe Permanent Representative of Colombia,\r\nAmbassador Alfonso Valdivieso, speaking earlier\r\ntoday, also reiterated the importance of that working\r\ngroup.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nThe rules of procedure, which remain provisional\r\nafter 56 years, should be formalized. Speakers’ lists —\r\nwhich are prepared in ways that most of us do not\r\nunderstand — should be prepared in an open,\r\ntransparent and equitable fashion. Despite all our pleas,\r\nthe informal working group has met only twice in 10\r\nmonths. The unavoidable conclusion is that the Council\r\nprefers arbitrary behaviour to rule-based regimes.\r\nHow have the global villagers reacted to all this?\r\nThey have called for more transparency. Indeed, that\r\nhas been the buzzword for much of the discussion here\r\nand in the Open-ended Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil reform. We support the call for transparency.\r\nFor Singapore, we are not sure that we fully understand\r\nhow all the decisions are made, even though we attend\r\nall the meetings without fail. This castle, we have\r\ndiscovered, has, like most medieval castles, a secret\r\nlabyrinth that we have not penetrated. Perhaps we\r\nnever will. Hence we doubt that calls for more\r\ntransparency will help very much. It would be like\r\ntrying to add windows to a castle. Such windows will\r\nnever shine light on the labyrinth.\r\nThe processes of decision-making within the\r\nCouncil are therefore likely to remain opaque, not\r\ntransparent. However, there is some balancing good\r\nnews. The output of these decision-making processes is\r\npublic and clearly visible. In recent years, the public\r\noutput of the Council has seen a phenomenal increase.\r\nIn a recent article, former United States Ambassador\r\nNancy Soderberg has documented that, during the cold\r\nwar, only 18 peacekeeping missions and two sanctions\r\nregimes were approved. But since the end of the cold\r\nwar 12 years ago, the Council has approved almost 40\r\npeacekeeping missions and imposed 13 sanctions\r\nregimes. As a consequence, the United Nations budget\r\nfor peacekeeping operations has exploded from $600\r\nmillion in 1989 to $3 billion in 2001. So, if we want to\r\ntruly reform the Council comprehensively, a more\r\nproductive approach would be to focus our attention on\r\nthis massive increase in output, which is clearly\r\nvisible.\r\nWe can devise many ingenious ways of assessing\r\nthis output. For example, the Council’s key\r\nresponsibility, assigned by the United Nations Charter,\r\nis to deal with threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Using open sources — say from the\r\nInternational Institute of Strategic Studies of London or\r\nJane’s Defence Weekly — we can draw a map of all the\r\ntrouble spots in the world. Over this map, we can\r\nsuperimpose another, drawn on a clear plastic sheet, of\r\nthe areas that the United Nations is intervening in. The\r\ndiscrepancy between the two should indicate areas of\r\ndivergence. It should be fairly easy then to pose direct,\r\nrelevant questions to the Council that could then help\r\nto reform the Council.\r\nThis is why we are disappointed with the work of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group. Here, let me stress\r\nthat we are criticizing the members of the Working\r\nGroup and not the Vice-Chairmen. The Open-ended\r\nWorking Group has not taken to heart the instruction of\r\nthe leaders to reform the Council comprehensively. To\r\navoid any misunderstanding here, let me also stress\r\nthat Singapore does support a reform of the\r\ncomposition of the Council. We support the clearly\r\narticulated position of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nCertainly, the Council can be effective only if it\r\naccurately reflects the current global configuration of\r\npower and not that of 1945. The world has changed\r\nenormously since then — indeed, it has changed\r\nenormously even since 11 September.\r\nThe Council cannot remain frozen. But if we\r\nwant to add new members — permanent, semi-\r\npermanent or temporary — do we not first have to\r\nunderstand what it is we want them to do in the castle\r\nbefore we select them? This point is especially\r\nimportant for the small States, of which Singapore is\r\none. Through a statistical analysis of the membership\r\nof the Council since 1945, we have discovered that\r\nsmall States have served on the average once, twice\r\nand sometimes never on the Security Council since its\r\ncreation. By contrast, larger States have served five to\r\neight times. For small States, therefore, it should be in\r\nour obvious self-interest to link the privileges of\r\npermanent or semi-permanent membership to\r\nobligation. If there are no reciprocal obligations to\r\nsmall States, how does it serve their interest to support\r\nthe current or additional vetoes?\r\nChanging the composition of the Council is\r\ntherefore only one dimension of Council reform.\r\nEqually importantly, we have to scrutinize and audit\r\nthe working methods of the Council. Undoubtedly,\r\nsome of the discussions on cluster II issues have had a\r\nbeneficial effect in making the Council slightly more\r\nopen, but, in order to comprehensively reform the\r\nCouncil, we may have to add a set of cluster III issues\r\nto assess the output.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nThe main difficulty we face here is that the global\r\nvillagers have not agreed on a simple, clear and\r\ncoherent conceptual framework to assess the output of\r\nthe Council. A partial listing would include the\r\npeacekeeping operations, which, as we noted in our\r\nspeech on the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in the past two years alone has\r\ngrown from 9,000 military troops and 2,000 civilian\r\npolice in 1999 to 35,000 military troops and 8,000\r\ncivilian police in 2001. It would also include the\r\nsanctions regimes, which have in turn subsidiary\r\nmonitoring mechanisms and panels of experts. It would\r\ninclude the recently established counter-terrorism\r\nCommittee, which has enormous and far-reaching\r\npowers. It would include the International Criminal\r\nTribunals, which cost a few hundred million dollars a\r\nyear, and, of course, the special Security Council\r\nmissions to trouble spots.\r\nThe question is this: Whose responsibility is it to\r\nassess this massive output to ensure that the Council is\r\ndoing a good job? A management expert recently told\r\nme that the first rule of management is this: if you\r\ncannot measure it, you cannot manage it. If it is not the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group which is going to measure\r\nit, do we need to create a separate group to do this?\r\nShould the Council do its own review or should the\r\nGeneral Assembly assign some other body — perhaps\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group — to do so?\r\nTo be fair to the Council, let me also add that it is\r\nabsolutely clear that it has done much good work in\r\nrecent years. Certainly, the Council can proudly claim a\r\nshare of the Nobel Peace Prize recently awarded to the\r\nUnited Nations. East Timor, for example, has the real\r\npotential of becoming a shining success story if the\r\nUnited Nations manages its exit well by agreeing to\r\ncontinued funding through assessed contributions —\r\nand incidentally the term assessed contributions is very\r\nimportant — over the next two years. Similarly, the\r\npeople of Kosovo, where the peacekeeping operation\r\ncosts $400 million a year, the people of Sierra Leone,\r\nwhere the peacekeeping operation costs $550 million\r\nand perhaps the people of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, where the peacekeeping operation costs\r\n$273 million, are all better off as a result of the\r\nmassive United Nations presence in their countries.\r\nLike any human institution, the Council has also had its\r\nshare of failures, as documented in the reports on\r\nRwanda and Srebrenica, which — for reasons that have\r\nnever been explained to us — have never been\r\nexamined by the General Assembly.\r\nWhat this regular mix of success and failure fails\r\nto reveal, however, is that there is a deep-seated,\r\nstructural problem in the Council’s responses to threats\r\nto international peace and security. As we know, the\r\nCouncil is often called upon to react to emergencies —\r\nas it is about to do, incidentally, in a massive way in\r\nAfghanistan in the near future. By reacting to\r\nemergencies, the work of the Council has often been\r\ncompared to a fire department. Most fire departments\r\nare expected to respond to a fire no matter where it\r\noccurs. The deep-seated structural problem of the\r\nCouncil is that it does not react like the New York City\r\nFire Department to emergencies. It is neither a\r\nprincipled nor a altruistic creature. Its decisions on\r\nwhere and how to react are conditioned more by the\r\nnational interests of the members of the Council than\r\nby the needs of the global community that they serve.\r\nLet me cite a simple, current, practical example to\r\nmake this point. Tomorrow the Security Council will\r\nbe discussing East Timor in open debate. Quite\r\nreasonably, a few of us in the Council, including\r\nSingapore, have asked the Council to endorse the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General in his report\r\non East Timor. This would serve both the East\r\nTimorese people and the international community.\r\nUnfortunately — and this is a live example — some\r\nmembers of the Council prefer to put their national\r\ninterests ahead of those of the international community.\r\nThis raises an obvious question: should the Security\r\nCouncil serve the national interests of some of its\r\nmembers or those of the international community that\r\nthe Council is dedicated to serve? Clearly any\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Council will have to\r\naddress such fundamental questions if we want to solve\r\nthe deep-seated structural problem of the Council.\r\nIt is difficult in a brief speech like this to suggest\r\nhow the Security Council could be comprehensively\r\nreformed. The Council is an enormously complex\r\ninstitution. It is becoming even more complex day by\r\nday, and we have seen — indeed in the first ten months\r\nof serving on the Council — the Council becoming\r\nmore and more complex. Unfortunately, it is also an\r\ninstitution that has not been appropriately or\r\ncomprehensively analyzed or understood by either\r\nacademia or the media. Indeed, we have yet to find a\r\ngood book or even a good series of articles that draw\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nout the real complexities of the Council. Frankly,\r\nneither has the General Assembly done so.\r\nThis is why we have compared the Security\r\nCouncil to a medieval castle. Its secret labyrinth has\r\nnot been mapped or discovered. If we want to seriously\r\nimplement our leaders’ instructions to comprehensively\r\nreform the Council, we have to begin by developing a\r\ncommon understanding of how the Council really\r\nworks. This will not be easy. We may have to keep the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group going to understand the\r\ninstitution that we are trying to reform. And if we do\r\nnot develop a good understanding of it, we will never\r\nbe able to implement our leaders’ instructions to\r\ncomprehensively reform the Council. But in order to\r\nachieve such an understanding, we may have to change\r\nthe language of our discourse in these annual debates.\r\nWe should first develop a common agreed framework\r\nfor understanding the essential nature of the Council\r\nthat we are trying to reform. Without such an analytical\r\nframework, we will be peeling off the external layers\r\nwithout getting to the core of the Council.\r\nIn conclusion, it may be useful for us to reiterate\r\nsome of the key points we wish to make here.\r\nFirstly — and I hope next year we will do so — we\r\nshould abide by our leaders’ instructions to\r\ncomprehensively reform the Council. Secondly, in\r\norder to reform the Council we have to have an agreed\r\nunderstanding of what the Council is doing and what\r\nthe Council is not doing. Thirdly, we cannot ignore\r\npolitical realities. The composition of the Council has\r\nto change with time. Fourthly, the General Assembly\r\nmembers have to decide what is more important for\r\nthem in the Council: to have a more representative\r\nCouncil or to have a more effective and accountable\r\nCouncil? Without agreed answers to these questions,\r\nwe may end up having this annual debate for another\r\neight years with no significant progress. If we do not\r\nwant that to happen, we should start afresh and take a\r\ndifferent and more comprehensive approach.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): For\r\nthe ninth consecutive year, the General Assembly\r\nconvenes to consider the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the\r\nCouncil. As usual, the delegation of Egypt is keenly\r\ninterested in participating in the general discussion on\r\nthis topic, because we believe that this matter is of\r\ngreat importance, given that it relates to one of the\r\nmost important organs of the United Nations.\r\nAlthough eight years have elapsed since the\r\nbeginning of the intensive work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group of the General Assembly on the matter,\r\nfor many obvious reasons, the Group was not able to\r\nachieve much progress. We note the different ideas and\r\ninitiatives concerning the future work of the Group and\r\nhow to achieve some progress.\r\nI would like here to make reference to the\r\nstatement made by the delegation of Egypt during the\r\nlast meeting of the Working Group, where we stressed\r\nthe position of the non-aligned movement regarding\r\ncomprehensive reforms and obstacles to them.\r\nI would like to reaffirm Egypt’s full commitment\r\nto the African position stated in the Harare Declaration\r\nof 1997, which emphasizes that Africa — which\r\nrepresents one third of the general membership —\r\nshould be allotted seven seats in the expanded Council,\r\ntwo permanent seats, in accordance with system of\r\nrotation, and five non-permanent seats.\r\nI would like to refer to some positive\r\ndevelopments in the Council’s working methods.\r\nAlthough limited, these developments deserve some\r\nencouragement and support. We call for more openness\r\nand more transparency in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nI lay particular stress on the following points.\r\nFirst, we are concerned at the fact that informal\r\nmeetings and consultations among Council members\r\nare increasingly, and unfortunately, becoming the rule\r\nrather than the exception. I believe that the concept of\r\ninformal consultations was introduced to provide the\r\nCouncil with some flexibility in its preliminary\r\nconsultations; it was not intended to be — and should\r\nnot be — a common practice and should not provide a\r\nforum for decision-making, with official meetings\r\nreserved simply for announcing those decisions.\r\nFormal meetings should not be limited to that function\r\nbecause the majority of Member States no longer\r\nunderstand the facts behind the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking.\r\nSecondly, the question of whether the veto power\r\nis a prerogative or a responsibility continues to block\r\nCouncil reform. There are still no checks on the\r\nexercise of that power, which continues to reflect\r\nnarrow national positions. This runs counter to the\r\nintentions of the founders of the Organization.\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nThirdly, we must continue a comprehensive\r\napproach to reform and must avoid taking small steps\r\nin various directions. We should aim for consensus on a\r\npackage of reforms that will take account of the\r\ninterests of the entire international community, as\r\nstated by the General Assembly on many occasions,\r\nnotably in November 1998 with the adoption of\r\nresolution 53/30 on the required majority for the\r\nadoption of any resolution or decision on Security\r\nCouncil reform.\r\nFourthly, the Assembly’s Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil must continue its work under its existing\r\nmandate and working methods, irrespective of the topic\r\nunder discussion, and particularly with respect to its\r\ninternal decision-making mechanism. Much could be\r\nsaid about the Group’s working methods, but it remains\r\nthe only transparent open-ended forum for discussion\r\nof these important issues. Last June, we were glad to\r\nsee the Security Council respond to the Assembly’s\r\ninvitation to send a delegation of permanent and non-\r\npermanent members to hold a dialogue with the\r\nWorking Group on increasing the transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s working methods. That was a good initiative,\r\nand we hope it will continue in future meetings.\r\nIn that connection, I want to make special\r\nreference to the work of the Council’s Working Group\r\non Documentation and Procedures. While we hail the\r\nestablishment of the Group as the institutional memory\r\nof the Council, and while we praise its work, we want\r\nto make a number of comments. First, the activities of\r\nthe Working Group continue to be restricted to the\r\nCouncil’s official meetings and do not deal with\r\ninformal consultations. As I said, informal\r\nconsultations have become the rule in the work of the\r\nCouncil. Secondly, it remains unclear how the general\r\nmembership will benefit from the Group’s activities in\r\nterms of access to relevant documentation.\r\nLet me make reference to another matter closely\r\nrelated to the Council’s working methods: the growing\r\ntrend to dispatch ever more Council fact-finding\r\nmissions to certain regions. We agree that such\r\nmissions are important and that they give the Council a\r\nclearer basis on which to make its decisions. But we\r\nthink their mandates should be explicit and should be\r\nmade public in advance, following due consultations\r\nwith the country or countries concerned. We must\r\nrespect State sovereignty, as enshrined in and\r\nguaranteed by the Charter.\r\nSpeaking of consultations with Member States, I\r\nmust refer to the question of consultations between the\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries. These are\r\nnow somewhat better than they were, but they are still\r\nnot good enough. It is difficult to imagine that the\r\nCouncil can extend the mandate of peacekeeping\r\noperation without adequate prior consultation with all\r\ntroop-contributing countries to determine their\r\nwillingness to extend the service of their troops — not\r\nto mention consultation with the country directly\r\nconcerned.\r\nNor can I fail to mention the annual reports of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly. A short\r\nwhile ago, the Assembly discussed the current report of\r\nthe Council (A/56/2). Many delegations, including\r\nours, thought we should be given a less narrative and\r\nmore analytical report that explains background and\r\ncontext and that provides adequate information on the\r\nitems on the Council’s agenda. We would like to see\r\nsuch reports in future years.\r\nMy statement was intended to reaffirm a number\r\nof principles that guide Egypt’s position on\r\ncomprehensive and integrated reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. As the Assembly’s Working Group enters its\r\nninth year, we shall continue our active participation in\r\nits work. We are confident that, under your able\r\nleadership, Mr. President, the Group will achieve\r\ntangible results: equitable and comprehensive reform.\r\nMr. van den Berg (Netherlands): The central\r\nissue that needs to be addressed is the connection\r\nbetween the Security Council and the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations. Improvement of the\r\ninteraction between United Nations Members and the\r\nSecurity Council can be made now if the political will\r\nis there. We had better not wait for the outcome of the\r\nnumbers game that we have been playing\r\nunsuccessfully for years. Security Council reform in\r\nthe traditional sense — size, the veto and the position\r\nof the permanent members — is important but has\r\nproven to be a long-term exercise. In this statement, the\r\nfocus will be on feasible results in the foreseeable\r\nfuture: my statement is on reform of working practices\r\nrather on reform of the Council itself. To achieve\r\nresults now, solutions should be pragmatic and within\r\nexisting Charter provisions. The objective should be to\r\nrender the work of the Security Council more\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\ntransparent, accountable, inclusive and collaborative,\r\nand, as such, more effective.\r\nLet us seize on the present momentum in the\r\naftermath of the tragic events of 11 September to look\r\ninto the possibility of forging better interaction\r\nbetween the Council and the general membership.\r\nWhether we talk about coalitions of the willing or\r\nregular United Nations peacekeeping operations,\r\nincluding post-conflict peace-building, we are dealing\r\nwith Member States able and ready to make their\r\nfinancial, personnel and other resources available. In\r\ndoing so, they assume at least as much responsibility as\r\nthose Member States that through their privileged\r\nposition in the Council are supposed to carry the\r\nbiggest burden. Actually, in terms of committing\r\ntroops, the major contributors are to be found outside\r\nthe Council. This is also true of financial support for\r\npeace-building operations. This shows the imbalance\r\nthat has come to exist between those that have\r\nresponsibility and those that are more involved in\r\nimplementation.\r\nIt is only fair to say that over time the Security\r\nCouncil has introduced important changes — very\r\nnotably so in terms of transparency and the\r\nparticipation of non-members of the Council in its\r\nwork. This progress we owe to a large extent to the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, which, while failing to\r\nreach agreement on the composition and size of the\r\nCouncil, has, over the years, been able to achieve\r\nconsiderable procedural improvements. We should not,\r\ntherefore, underestimate the willingness for change of\r\nthe Council itself. The Working Group and the Council\r\nhave, in a sense, interacted effectively in this regard.\r\nThe relationship between troop-contributing countries\r\nand the Council, for example, has been an obvious\r\nbeneficiary of this development.\r\nHowever, the question is: are we indeed satisfied\r\nwith the present state of affairs? Is the Council up to\r\nresponding effectively to complex, multifaceted\r\nsecurity issues that require a multi-component\r\nresponse? The Netherlands is of the view that there is\r\nstill scope to improve the effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil. Interestingly, the Charter gives us sufficient\r\noptions to do this. The founding fathers of the United\r\nNations laid down a structure that is still solid enough\r\nto serve the cause of peace effectively today and in the\r\nfuture, if only we are prepared to use its potential to the\r\nfull.\r\nAt this point, we have to make a clear distinction\r\nbetween the interaction of the Security Council and the\r\nMember States, on the one hand, and the cooperation\r\nand coordination of the main intergovernmental bodies\r\nin the United Nations, on the other.\r\nWhat can be done to support a meaningful\r\ninteraction between the Security Council and the\r\nmembership of the Organization? Over the past few\r\nyears a number of suggestions have been made to this\r\nend. Some of these practical proposals have already\r\nbeen implemented, and others have met with a\r\nsympathetic ear and are still being studied. It would\r\nappear that the interaction between the Council and the\r\nmembership could be further strengthened by\r\ncombining an analysis of the decision-making process\r\nin the Council with suggestions and proposals, in order\r\nto find which ones, when implemented, would make a\r\npractical contribution to the interaction between the\r\nCouncil and Member States. Such an analysis would\r\nalso show whether there are, on the map of interaction,\r\nblank spots providing scope for improved interaction.\r\nThe credibility of the Security Council and, for\r\nthat matter, its effectiveness, are best served if its\r\ndecisions are perceived as legitimate and\r\nrepresentative. For that reason, the issue of\r\nrepresentativeness has been at the heart of the debate\r\non the composition and size of the Council. So far,\r\nrepresentativeness has implied the need for regions to\r\nbe better represented in the Council through\r\nmembership of the Council by individual States of\r\nthose regions. However, in this context, the discussion\r\non the expansion of the Council seems deadlocked.\r\nMaybe we should develop a more pragmatic view of\r\nregional representation and, instead of looking at it in\r\nterms of membership of the Council only, should also\r\nfocus on an issue-based approach. This would imply\r\ncreating innovative mechanisms to ensure that regional\r\nplayers and all others contributing to a particular\r\nUnited Nations activity are involved in the processes\r\nleading up to decisions on peace operations in the\r\nregion concerned.\r\nA case in point is the issue of troop-contributing\r\ncountries, which is at a critical juncture right now.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1353 (2001) was certainly\r\na step forward in keeping open the option for a more\r\nfar-reaching mechanism for the involvement of troop-\r\ncontributing countries in the work of the Council. I\r\nhave already touched upon a possible role for non-\r\nmembers of the Security Council in the preparation of a\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\ndecision and its implementation. We expect that the\r\npresent deliberations of the Security Council Working\r\nGroup will lead to specific proposals to this end.\r\nEffective involvement of non-members of the\r\nSecurity Council requires the membership to organize\r\nitself to facilitate the interaction with the Security\r\nCouncil. We have to make things manageable for the\r\nSecurity Council. Let us take up the example of the\r\ntroop-contributing countries again. For a mission-\r\nspecific mechanism to be effective in an operational\r\nsense, membership could in principle be limited to\r\nmembers of the Security Council and those whose\r\ncontributions have a strong operational impact.\r\nHowever, considerations of representativeness could\r\nalso be the basis for the composition of such a group.\r\nThese mechanisms could provide a connection with so-\r\ncalled groups of friends, consisting of interested\r\nCouncil members, all troop-contributing countries and\r\nother interested States.\r\nI would like to conclude by making a few\r\nremarks on the cooperation and coordination between\r\nthe principal intergovernmental bodies of the United\r\nNations — an issue which has to be clearly separated\r\nfrom the issue of interaction which I have just\r\ndiscussed. In the area of peace-building, the dividing\r\nline between peacekeeping and peace-building has\r\nbeen increasingly blurred so as to create one\r\nconceptually seamless operation. This fact, however, is\r\nnot reflected in the way in which the principal\r\nintergovernmental bodies — the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Security\r\nCouncil — cooperate. Let us face it: the Security\r\nCouncil is venturing into the area of peace-building\r\nsimply by default. There is no adequate\r\nintergovernmental structure to take over the baton to\r\nfollow up on the peacekeeping activities of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIn this context, one can hear critical remarks\r\naccusing the Security Council of encroaching upon the\r\ncompetence of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. This, of course, creates\r\nan additional source of discontent in interaction with\r\nthe Security Council. This is hardly fair, however,\r\nbecause it is up to us — the general membership — to\r\nimprove and amend the present intergovernmental\r\nstructure with a view to establishing a clear division of\r\nlabour between the Security Council and the other\r\nintergovernmental bodies. Here again, it is, in fact,\r\namazing how much room the Charter gives us in this\r\nrespect.\r\nThe Netherlands recently organized a seminar, in\r\ncooperation with the International Peace Academy, on\r\nthe issue of cooperation and coordination between the\r\nprincipal United Nations bodies. The seminar took\r\nplace on 19 and 20 of this month in Tarrytown, and\r\nbrought together permanent representatives on the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nand of countries not members of any of these organs.\r\nThe conclusions reached at that seminar on the present\r\nstate of intergovernmental coordination in the area of\r\npeace-building were candid, and the proposed solutions\r\nwere practical and realistic.\r\nMy delegation will shortly present the summary\r\nand conclusions of this seminar to Member States\r\nthrough letters to you, Mr. President, and to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council and the President of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council. It appears to me that\r\nthe outcome of the seminar could serve as a thought-\r\nprovoking contribution to the debate on the report of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, which we will have\r\nin this Assembly later this year.\r\nMr. Cunningham (United States of America):\r\nThe United States is committed to the effort to\r\nstrengthen the Security Council. Enlarging the Council\r\nis a means to that end, not the end in itself. A reformed\r\nCouncil, with Japan and Germany assuming permanent\r\nseats, and with an expanded number of rotating seats,\r\nwould better enable the Council to exercise its primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security under the Charter.\r\nAs we are all aware, the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup is going into its eighth year of deliberations.\r\nThis is indicative of the complexity of the issues that\r\nremain to be resolved: balancing representation\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries,\r\nachieving appropriate and equitable representation\r\namong regions and ensuring that Council enlargement\r\nis not purchased at the cost of lost effectiveness — by\r\nwhich we mean the ability to act promptly and\r\ndecisively. The Open-ended Working Group, however,\r\nis the only venue in which the difficult issues\r\noutstanding can be resolved successfully. We want it to\r\nsucceed in building as broad a consensus as possible.\r\nThe time has come to move beyond the annual speech-\r\nmaking and debating of language nuance and instead to\r\nanalyse seriously the various models for an expanded\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nCouncil, to find the one that will give us an enhanced,\r\nstronger, more effective Security Council.\r\nSuch a Security Council must have genuine and\r\nbroad support. To get there, we cannot and should not\r\nattempt to divorce the issues of the expanded Council’s\r\nultimate size and its composition. Doing so will merely\r\nensure more delay. And it will come as no surprise that\r\nwe will continue to oppose efforts to limit or eliminate\r\nthe veto, initiatives that serve only to stifle progress on\r\nthe important task ahead of us. The veto remains an\r\nessential element of the Council’s ability to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nAs we discuss a future Council structure, we note\r\nthat the current Council structure is certainly up to the\r\nchallenge of advancing international peace and\r\nsecurity. It is capable of prompt and effective action,\r\nand there is no better example of this than the\r\nCouncil’s swift passage of Security Council resolution\r\n1368 (2001), which articulated the United Nations\r\nunequivocal condemnation of terrorism within 26 hours\r\nof the 11 September attacks, and resolution 1373\r\n(2001), a landmark decision that has forever changed\r\nthe battle against terrorism.\r\nThe United States will work through the Open-\r\nended Working Group, and in any discussions, to\r\nensure that the Security Council continues to be the\r\nlinchpin of international peace and security. We will\r\nalso join others in making the Council more transparent\r\nand more representative of the entire membership. That\r\nis important work as well, and we are fully engaged.\r\nWe hope that we can make real progress on all these\r\nissues in the coming session.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): We are once again gathered\r\nto debate the obvious. There is general agreement that\r\nthe Security Council needs to be reformed and enlarged\r\nin order to make it more representative of the general\r\nmembership, and to enable it to discharge its\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations\r\nmore effectively and with greater credibility and\r\nlegitimacy. However, the devil lies in the detail.\r\nDeliberations over the last eight years in the General\r\nAssembly and in its Open-ended Working Group to\r\nconsider all aspects of the question of an increase in\r\nthe membership of the Council and to effectively\r\naddress other matters related to the reform of the\r\nCouncil have failed to arrive at a comprehensive\r\npackage acceptable to everyone.\r\nWe were encouraged by the broad support that\r\nthis subject generated during the Millennium Summit,\r\nthe general debate and subsequent consideration under\r\nthe relevant agenda item during the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly. Our heads of State and\r\nGovernment, in the Millennium Declaration, have\r\ndirected us to intensify efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. In the\r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Summit, we must\r\ndischarge the enormous responsibility placed upon us\r\nin this regard and address this vital issue with all the\r\ncommitment and seriousness it deserves.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have\r\ndramatically coalesced world opinion in a common\r\nresolve to comprehensively combat the evil menace of\r\nterrorism in all its manifestations. The Security\r\nCouncil has, through resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nundertaken the ambitious and laudable task of rooting\r\nout this pernicious scourge root and branch. Its\r\nCommittee on Counter-Terrorism has begun to address\r\nthis issue in a serious and meaningful manner. We\r\ncommend the Council for acting with alacrity. As a\r\ncountry that has been the victim for many years of this\r\ngrave assault on the cherished ideals of freedom,\r\ndemocracy and pluralism, we wish the Council all\r\nsuccess in this crucial responsibility towards the global\r\ncommunity. We cannot afford to fail in this critical\r\nendeavour.\r\nIn countering threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, the importance of the role of the Security\r\nCouncil cannot be overemphasized. An\r\nunrepresentative and anachronistic Council that does\r\nnot reflect current global realities would find it\r\nextremely difficult, notwithstanding its worthy\r\nintentions, to effectively and credibly tackle this\r\nmomentous challenge to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Moreover, it is clear that the focus of the\r\nCouncil’s actions, as in the past, would be\r\noverwhelmingly developing countries, and the impact\r\nof the Council’s actions would be almost entirely felt in\r\nthe developing world. This only reinforces the\r\nimperative of enlarging the membership of the Council\r\nin both categories to make it more representative of the\r\ngeneral membership and, in particular, the vast\r\nmajority of developing countries. We would like to\r\nreiterate that a comprehensive package which includes\r\nexpansion of the Council’s membership, improvements\r\nin its working methods and reform of its decision-\r\nmaking process is the only way to proceed. This would\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nequip the Security Council to confront the grave\r\nchallenges that confront the international community in\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nWe have had the opportunity to outline India’s\r\nposition on Security Council restructuring on several\r\noccasions in the past. However, we would like to\r\ncaution against the temptation to resort to piecemeal\r\nand partial solutions. After striving for over eight\r\nyears, if we were to agree to an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council in the non-permanent category alone,\r\nor if we were to make cosmetic changes in its working\r\nmethods, we would be doing a disservice not only to\r\nourselves but to the Organization as a whole. Instead of\r\naddressing the main issues, we would be shying away\r\nfrom them and thereby perpetuating an international\r\nsystem characterized by inequity.\r\nWe should avoid the seemingly simpler option of\r\npromoting agreement only on those issues on which a\r\nbroad meeting of minds may emerge. Cluster I and\r\ncluster II issues are equally important and need to be\r\nconsidered together. The Non-Aligned Movement\r\n(NAM) has consistently held the view that expansion\r\nand reform of the Security Council should be integral\r\nparts of a common package. Any attempts to promote\r\none at the expense of the other not only would\r\ncontravene the NAM position but would also go\r\nagainst the mandate of the General Assembly to\r\nconsider all aspects of this issue. A large number of\r\ndelegations, including ours, have made suggestions\r\npertaining to the working methods of the Council\r\nduring the debate on the report of the Council held\r\nearlier this month. We would not like to repeat them\r\nhere. It is our expectation that these suggestions will be\r\nconsidered and the required improvements effected.\r\nWhile debating the issue of Security Council\r\nreform, one cannot but comment on the manner in\r\nwhich the Council mandates peacekeeping operations,\r\na highly visible manifestation of the Organization’s\r\nattempts to maintain international peace and security. It\r\nis most regrettable that one of the basic flaws in United\r\nNations peacekeeping is the absence of a genuine\r\npartnership between the Security Council and the\r\ntroop- contributing countries. This is further\r\naccentuated by the fact that very few Council members\r\nare major troop contributors. Complex and dangerous\r\noperations like those in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Sierra Leone and the one being envisaged\r\nfor Burundi cannot succeed in the absence of\r\ncooperation with the troop-contributing countries. The\r\nunfortunate incidents in Sierra Leone last year should\r\nhave galvanized the Council to take appropriate\r\nmeasures.\r\nWhile recognizing that Security Council\r\nresolutions 1327 (2000) and 1353 (2001) seek to\r\naddress this problem, we believe that this is simply not\r\nenough. The Brahimi Panel made a specific\r\nrecommendation in this regard in paragraph 61 of its\r\nreport. A number of troop-contributing countries have\r\namplified on this particular recommendation and\r\nsubmitted proposals to the Council. We are grateful to\r\nSingapore for having resurrected the need for\r\nstrengthening cooperation with troop-contributing\r\ncountries and brought it to the forefront of the\r\nCouncil’s agenda.\r\nWe would like also to commend Ambassador\r\nCurtis Ward of Jamaica for his untiring efforts as\r\nChairman of the Council’s Working Group on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations in trying to get the Working\r\nGroup to focus on the proposals made by troop-\r\ncontributing countries. There should be no attempt to\r\npreserve the status quo on the specious plea that\r\nexisting mechanisms suffice. Those charged with the\r\nresponsibility for peace and security would hopefully\r\nboth contribute troops for peacekeeping and ensure a\r\nculture of consultations with troop contributors that is\r\njust and which contributes meaningfully to the\r\ndecision-making process, which has a direct impact on\r\nthe lives of their troops serving the United Nations.\r\nThis is an anomaly that must be seriously and\r\nmeaningfully addressed lest the disenchantment of\r\ntroop contributors leave the Council with little else but\r\nthe holding of mostly pointless thematic debates.\r\nWe would like to reiterate our conviction that any\r\nincrease in permanent membership should be guided by\r\nobjective and not subjective, selective or arbitrary\r\ncriteria, and that all new permanent members should be\r\ndesignated together by the General Assembly, which is\r\nthe only forum which can elect them. In this regard,\r\nthere should be no restrictions imposed on the role or\r\nauthority of the General Assembly.\r\nWe would like to commend Mr. Harri Holkeri, the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, for his\r\npersonal contribution in trying to focus discussions on\r\nSecurity Council reform in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. His very pertinent remarks at the concluding\r\nsession of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly on this issue could guide us in our\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nsubsequent deliberations. His initiative in writing to\r\nForeign Ministers of Member States on this important\r\nsubject is particularly praiseworthy. It would be very\r\nuseful if the replies received from Member States were\r\nbrought out in a compendium before the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group commences its work next year.\r\nPrime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said at the\r\nMillennium Summit that:\r\n“As the world’s largest democracy, with\r\nenormous potential and rapidly growing\r\neconomic power, and being a major contributor to\r\npeacekeeping operations, India has a natural\r\nclaim to a permanent seat in the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council”.\r\nIndia has consistently contributed to all aspects of\r\nthe Organization’s work. We believe that on any\r\nobjective grounds India would be considered as\r\nqualified for permanent membership of an expanded\r\nSecurity Council, whenever the membership finds this\r\ndecision before it.\r\nIt is imperative that discussions on Security\r\nCouncil reform continue in a sustained and meaningful\r\nmanner. There is no reason for pessimism, even though\r\nagreement in vital areas continues to elude us, even\r\nafter eight years of protracted negotiations. We look\r\nforward to continuing our discussions in the Open-\r\nended Working Group next year.\r\nMr. Petrič (Slovenia): I would like to begin, Sir,\r\nby expressing Slovenia’s appreciation for the work\r\ndone by your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, and by\r\nAmbassadors Ingólfsson of Iceland and De Saram of\r\nSri Lanka, the two Vice-Chairmen of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform. The\r\nprogress achieved in the Working Group, though\r\nmodest, is to a large extent the result of their tireless\r\nefforts to advance the reform process. I would also like\r\nto thank Mr. Holkeri for having provided us with the\r\ncomprehensive and detailed report of the Working\r\nGroup. We are, of course, confident, Mr. President, that\r\nthis work will continue in the same manner during the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly under your\r\nthoughtful and energetic guidance. Let me also state\r\nthat Slovenia fully aligns itself with the statement\r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Belgium on\r\nbehalf of the G-10 Group.\r\nSince the creation of our Organization and the\r\nestablishment of the Security Council as one of its\r\nmain bodies, the world has radically changed. Its\r\npolitical, economic and social structures are very\r\ndifferent from the ones that existed when the United\r\nNations was born. We are all aware of these changes,\r\nand I daresay that we all agree that there is an urgent\r\nneed to adapt our Organization — and the Security\r\nCouncil in particular — to the realities of a globalized\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is my Government’s firm belief that the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council must reflect the\r\nnew realities of international community. The new\r\ndistribution of political and economic power and the\r\nsimple but glorious fact that more than 100 new\r\nnations — Slovenia, my country, among them — have\r\ncome into being in the last 50 years should also be\r\nreflected in the composition of the Security Council.\r\nThe current composition of the Security Council\r\nsimply does not correspond to the realities of the\r\ninternational community. It is no wonder, then, that\r\nproblems related to the authority, legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness of the Council are constantly being\r\nraised.\r\nMany specific proposals on the enlargement of\r\nthe Security Council, in terms of both its permanent\r\nand non-permanent membership, have been submitted\r\nsince 1993, when — with great expectations — we\r\nstarted the debate on Security Council reform. Past\r\ndebates, including the general debate at the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the Assembly, have indicated that a large\r\nnumber of States — including Slovenia — support an\r\nenlargement in both categories of Security Council\r\nmembership. This, in Slovenia’s view, is the only\r\npossible way to achieve what we need most: a fully\r\nrepresentative Security Council. Of course, we do not\r\nsupport “quick fix” solutions, and we believe that,\r\nbefore any enlargement takes place, a careful\r\ncalculation must be made in order to ensure the\r\nadequate and equitable geographic representation of all\r\nregional groups, including the Eastern European\r\nGroup, whose membership in the United Nations has\r\nmore than doubled in recent years.\r\nNevertheless, after eight years of extensive, but\r\nalso repetitive, deliberations, we should try to come to\r\nsome conclusions. With respect to Security Council\r\nreform, we should, during the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, endeavour to see where we already\r\nagree, where we are close to a general consensus, and\r\nwhere any consensus is out of reach for the time being.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is not an\r\nevent, but a process. We understand that it will take\r\ntime and that the problems involved are complex and\r\nsensitive and go back to the roots of our Organization.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that the time has come\r\nfor us to focus on the positive achievements of our past\r\ndebate. We should try to focus especially on those\r\naspects of reform which are within reach of a general\r\nconsensus. Progress has been made in the debate in the\r\nWorking Group, and I believe that the progress\r\nachieved is a solid basis for moving forward. My\r\ndelegation believes that we have reached a point where\r\nwe should also seriously reconsider the methods of our\r\nfuture work, since to continue to repeat our views again\r\nand again will not bring us nearer our common\r\nobjective of making the Security Council truly\r\nrepresentative and effective.\r\nReform of the Security Council is, of course, not\r\nonly enlargement. For the majority of Member States,\r\nthe question of working methods, transparency of work\r\nand decision-making, including the use of the veto, are\r\nof the same importance.\r\nWe note with satisfaction several improvements\r\nin the working methods of the Council. They have been\r\nencouraged to a large extent by the discussions in the\r\nWorking Group and are also a very positive reaction by\r\nthe Council itself to the criticism expressed, which\r\nagain proves the relevance of the continuing\r\ndiscussions in the Working Group and elsewhere.\r\nThe Security Council, as a general rule, does not\r\nmeet mostly behind closed doors any more. The\r\nnumber of open meetings is growing, even though the\r\npractice of holding open debates may need more\r\nprecision, since some of the discussions are starting to\r\nresemble the discussions in the General Assembly.\r\nMeetings with troop-contributing countries have\r\nrecently also witnessed some positive changes that\r\nenable those that contribute their troops to participate\r\nin the work of the Security Council.\r\nWe also welcome the greater use of Security\r\nCouncil missions to troubled areas, and believe that\r\nsuch missions should be used especially as a tool of\r\npreventive diplomacy. We should like to encourage\r\nfurther innovations in the work of the Security Council\r\nwhich enhance the cooperation between the Council\r\nand the rest of the membership of the United Nations.\r\nTransparency in the work of the Security Council\r\nand its President has also increased significantly, even\r\nthough it varies due to differences in the approach of\r\nthe various presidencies. We would encourage as much\r\nas possible a unified policy of transparency to the\r\nbenefit of the entire membership.\r\nOne of the most important, and also most\r\ncontroversial, aspects of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil is, of course, not the right of veto, which we\r\ndo not oppose as such, but the use of the veto. In past\r\ndiscussions, including the deliberations in the Working\r\nGroup, various proposals have been made. We feel that\r\nas far as the right of veto is concerned, we are still far\r\nfrom any consensus. So the discussion and the genuine\r\ndialogue must continue. Slovenia’s view is that all\r\npermanent Security Council members — the old and\r\nthe new — should enjoy the same status in the\r\ndecision-making process in the Council.\r\nNevertheless, we also believe that ways can be\r\nfound, based on many existing and converging\r\nproposals, to limit the use of the veto so as to satisfy\r\nthe larger membership of the Organization. My\r\ndelegation has stated during the deliberations in the\r\nWorking Group — and I repeat — that the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council should be invited to\r\nstate on a case-by-case basis why the veto was used.\r\nThis would, in our view, be one useful instrument to\r\nmake the work of the Council more transparent and\r\nthus closer to the general membership.\r\nThe veto is a specific right entrusted to some\r\nMember States by the Charter to enable them to carry\r\nspecial responsibility for international peace and\r\nsecurity. The right of veto is not a privilege, but\r\nrecognition of their special responsibility. Permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council bear this special\r\nresponsibility not only in the interest of each\r\npermanent member, but also in the interest of the entire\r\ninternational community. So the decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council are supposed to be made on behalf of\r\nthe entire membership of the United Nations and\r\nindeed the whole world community. It is then not too\r\nmuch to expect the permanent members to use this\r\nunique and far-reaching right, the right of veto, in a\r\ntransparent way.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): We regret that, after eight\r\nyears of discussion, we have not yet reached consensus\r\non the delicate question of Security Council reform. It\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nis a difficult and complex issue. Despite all the\r\nfrustration that is understandably felt, we should\r\ncontinue to do everything possible to find a solution to\r\nthis crucial issue. The enthusiasm created by last year’s\r\nMillennium Summit should be sustained, and every\r\nstep should be taken to make progress on this common\r\nundertaking.\r\nSince its creation in 1993, the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform has\r\nexamined a number of aspects of restructuring this\r\ncentral organ of the United Nations system. Many\r\nproposals have been made on enlarging the Council, on\r\nits working methods and on its decision-making\r\nprocess, with the goal of making the Council a\r\ntransparent and democratic organ enjoying the\r\nconfidence of Member States as a whole.\r\nOur position on this question is well known and\r\nhas often been reiterated here in the General Assembly,\r\nas well as in the Open-ended Working Group. Our\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs,\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad, reiterated this position in his\r\nstatement during the Millennium Summit held in\r\nSeptember last year. We are in favour of increasing the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members.\r\nWith respect to new permanent members, we\r\nbelieve that, due to today’s global realities, two\r\nmembers should come from industrialized countries\r\nand three from developing countries. In our opinion,\r\nthis formula, though it does not yet have universal\r\nsupport, could be the basis for discussion in our work\r\nin coming years.\r\nWith respect to increasing the number of non-\r\npermanent members, we consider reasonable the idea\r\nthat Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean,\r\nand Eastern Europe should each have a representative\r\non a new, enlarged Security Council. This formula, like\r\nmany others, merits more careful consideration.\r\nIn Council reform, we, like the other members of\r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, are in favour\r\nof transparency in the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. We believe that transparency — particularly\r\nin the Council’s decision-making process — would\r\nenable all of us to understand the rationale for its\r\ndecisions, which would help the Council to gain the\r\ntrust of all Member States.\r\nThe veto is one of the major problems that we\r\nface. It is at the very heart of the question of Council\r\nreform and is clearly one of the more controversial\r\npoints in our overall efforts to restructure this body. As\r\nwe all know, the vast majority of Member States\r\nbelieve that the right to the veto is anachronistic,\r\ndiscriminatory and anti-democratic. We believe that it\r\nis time to recognize the need to consider progressively\r\nrestricting the use of this privilege, first limiting it to\r\nissues under Chapter VII of the Charter and eventually\r\nabolishing it completely. Of course, this will not be\r\neasy, given the various positions on this matter, but we\r\nshould have the courage to continue discussing this\r\nfundamental issue in order to find a solution acceptable\r\nto all.\r\nOur world has changed. The United Nations, and\r\nthe Security Council in particular, must adapt to the\r\nnew situation. That is why, like other delegations, we\r\nattach great importance to reforming this major body\r\nentrusted with the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. However, given the complexity of this\r\nquestion, we should be patient, continue to debate and\r\ntry to benefit from the momentum created by the\r\nMillennium Summit. We believe that together we\r\nshould be able to attain our ultimate goal of making the\r\nCouncil a transparent and democratic body with\r\nenhanced legitimacy and, especially, credibility.\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): Let\r\nme start by thanking you, Mr President, for calling a\r\ndebate on this agenda item. Allow me to pay tribute to\r\nthe contribution to the reform debate made by your\r\npredecessor as President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, and his two Working Group Vice-\r\nChairmen, Ambassadors de Saram and Ingólfsson. We\r\nnow look forward to working with you and your Vice-\r\nChairmen during the coming year.\r\nThe United Kingdom remains committed to\r\nimplementing the call of world leaders in the\r\nMillennium Declaration to achieve a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects. As a\r\npermanent Council member, we realize that it remains\r\nessential that the Security Council be made more\r\nrepresentative of the modern world, and thus better\r\nequipped to tackle the many familiar and new\r\nchallenges on its agenda.\r\nThe United Kingdom regrets that there has been\r\nlittle progress this year towards Council enlargement,\r\ndespite the efforts of President Holkeri. Yet we see\r\nclear evidence of the emergence of general consensus\r\non certain issues — for example, that expansion must\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\ninclude developing countries. It has also become clear\r\nthat a majority wish to see expansion in both\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of\r\nmembership.\r\nWe welcome the efforts made by Mr. Holkeri and\r\nhis Bureau in the preparation of conference room\r\npapers to focus the debate in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup. While, of course, the Working Group works on\r\nthe basis that nothing is agreed until everything is\r\nagreed, the United Kingdom’s approach during the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly was to\r\nattempt to narrow the areas of disagreement. This\r\ncontinues to be our approach. We hope that this will\r\nallow the Working Group to focus on areas where\r\nagreement is possible and to move progressively to the\r\nmore difficult questions, while maintaining the ultimate\r\ngoal of achieving a comprehensive reform package.\r\nWe are pleased that further progress has been\r\nmade over the last year on improving the Council’s\r\nworking practices. The United Kingdom and other\r\nSecurity Council presidencies have contributed to this\r\nprocess. A number of innovations have been taken\r\nforward. The balance between public meetings and\r\ninformal consultations may still not be quite right, but\r\nwe have sought to hold as many Council meetings in\r\npublic as possible. We have also conducted personal\r\nbriefings by the presidency of non-members after\r\ninformal consultations. We have invited non-members\r\nto speak in the Council in most debates. We have also\r\nsought to improve consultations with non-members,\r\nparticularly through briefings with troop-contributing\r\ncountries. We attempted to hold a meeting with\r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council during\r\nthe presidency in April to discuss areas of work where\r\nintergovernmental coordination clearly needs to be\r\nenhanced, such as peace-building. As Chairman of the\r\nnew counter-terrorism Committee, I have already held\r\na number of briefings to inform the wider membership\r\nof the work under way in the Committee. In these\r\nways, our strong support for coordination and\r\ntransparency will continue.\r\nThe work of the Council has now become\r\nsignificantly more accessible to non-members, without\r\nany diminution in its ability to take effective action. I\r\nhope that the Council will continue this welcome trend\r\ntowards openness, and that it will be prepared to try\r\nfurther innovations when necessary. In response, it\r\nwould be good to see the wider membership using the\r\ngreater opportunities to address the Council to debate\r\npoints more spontaneously and interactively. The\r\nUnited Kingdom will continue to encourage an\r\nevolution in that respect.\r\nThe United Kingdom is committed to making real\r\nprogress on Security Council reform during the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly. We stand ready\r\nto assist you, Mr. President, and your Vice-Chairmen,\r\nwith our full support.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): Two weeks ago the\r\nGeneral Assembly discussed the report of the Security\r\nCouncil. A significant number of Member States took\r\npart in that debate, which, in the view of my\r\ndelegation, set the stage for the item before us today. I\r\nsay this because the imperfections and shortcomings in\r\nthe report of the Security Council, which have been so\r\nwell articulated, go to the heart of the longstanding\r\nitem we are now considering. Today I shall not\r\ncomment in detail on the issues surrounding the item\r\nunder discussion because we have done so for more\r\nthan six years in the ad hoc Open-ended Working\r\nGroup of the General Assembly, as well as in many\r\nother forums. Rather, I will make brief remarks on the\r\nburning need to garner political courage and will to\r\nbring to an early and successful end the work of the\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Security Council\r\nso as to bring about an increase in both categories of\r\nmembership of the Security Council, in line with the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical representation and\r\nthe sovereign equality of States, in order to enhance its\r\ncredibility and effectiveness.\r\nWe live in a complex world in which the role of\r\nthe United Nations is evolving and its organs are\r\nassuming greater proportions. Cognizant of the fact\r\nthat it is essential that the United Nations be reformed\r\nand modernized, we have embarked on a process to\r\nrevisit the functioning premises of the organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. We have done so successfully with the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, and in fact we continue\r\nto do so. Likewise, we continue to collectively\r\nundertake measures to strengthen the General\r\nAssembly. Why then can we not do the same for the\r\nSecurity Council?\r\nThe reform of the Security Council constitutes\r\none of the important components of the efforts to\r\nstrengthen, revitalize and democratize the United\r\nNations. Therefore, the political courage we\r\ndemonstrated to strengthen the General Assembly and\r\nto review and revitalize the work of the Economic and\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nSocial Council and its related fields should open the\r\nway to the successful conclusion of the equally\r\nimportant work on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation has taken note of the\r\nrecommendation of the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group, as contained in document A/55/47.\r\nLikewise, my delegation expresses its thanks to\r\nMr. Harry Holkeri, President of the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly and the Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group, the Permanent Representatives of\r\nIceland and Sri Lanka, for having steered the work of\r\nthe Working Group.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, the world leaders\r\nresolved to intensify efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform and democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects. In this context, the\r\nclustering of issues is aimed at facilitating the work of\r\nthe Working Group. It does not encompass value\r\njudgement, as correctly implied in the decision of the\r\nWorking Group that cluster I and cluster II issues be\r\nconsidered on equal terms. Namibia shares that view.\r\nWe must realize that the indefinite postponement\r\nof the enlargement and the democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council will amount to the gradual erosion\r\nand relegation of the General Assembly and other\r\norgans of the United Nations. This will be detrimental\r\nto the effective functioning of the United Nations and\r\ncertainly is not in the interest of the majority of its\r\nMembers.\r\nDuring the consideration of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, I emphasized, among others things,\r\nthe gap between the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolutions and their implementation and enforcement.\r\nThis is one of the issues that Member States must\r\naddress.\r\nAs an example, most of the questions before the\r\nSecurity Council are on Africa. The majority of\r\nresolutions adopted to date by the Security Council are\r\nalso on Africa. Yet, when totalling the number of\r\nresolutions that have been fully implemented and\r\nenforced, Africa will be at the bottom of the list.\r\nGranted, there could be several reasons for this\r\nunwarranted state of affairs. However, Namibia, having\r\nhad that rare privilege of serving on the Security\r\nCouncil, can safely state that the major reason is the\r\nunbalanced, undemocratic and non-representative\r\nstructural set-up of the Security Council. Therefore, it\r\nis crucial for us that the Security Council be reformed\r\nand democratized.\r\nHence we stand by the decision of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) that Africa\r\ndeserves two permanent and five non-permanent seats\r\non the Security Council. Africa’s decision that the two\r\npermanent seats for Africa will be on a rotational basis\r\nagain demonstrates the collective, representative and\r\ndemocratic spirit in which Africa is pursuing this issue.\r\nOur position on the veto is well known. However,\r\nlet me reiterate that the veto power as a voting\r\ninstrument has not served us well. Nevertheless, it is\r\nNamibia’s view that an expanded Security Council\r\nshould have permanent members with equal privileges\r\nand obligations. International peace and security\r\ncannot be left to the goodwill of some.\r\nHence, the Council must be democratized in order\r\nto ensure its accountability to the entire membership of\r\nthe United Nations, on whose behalf it carries out the\r\nprimary function of maintaining international peace\r\nand security.\r\nMr. Manalo (Philippines): As a founding\r\nmember of the United Nations, the Philippines has a\r\nprofound interest in the reform of the Security Council.\r\nWe are therefore fully committed to finding a mutually\r\nacceptable compromise on the outstanding issues\r\nbefore the Open-ended Working Group on the reform\r\nof the Security Council, particularly on the expansion\r\nof the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Council. We remain equally committed\r\nto advancing the progress already achieved on specific\r\nmeasures to reform the procedures and decision-\r\nmaking process of the Council, with a view to making\r\nthem more transparent and open to the participation of\r\nnon-members.\r\nThe Philippines also continues to believe that any\r\nfinal decision on the reform of the Security Council\r\nshould be in the form of a package agreement\r\nconsisting of an expanded Security Council\r\nmembership in both categories and a comprehensive\r\nand coherent set of recommended measures to be\r\nappropriately institutionalized by the Council so as to\r\nreform the procedures of the Council in order to\r\nprovide transparency and greater participation of\r\nMember States in its decision-making process. Another\r\npossible element in this package would be the\r\nlimitation of the application of the veto to issues\r\nrelated to the maintenance of international peace and\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nsecurity. It goes without saying that the general support\r\nof the United Nations membership for any final\r\npackage is necessary.\r\nTo help achieve this needed compromise we may\r\nalso have to examine the Working Group’s methods of\r\nwork and improve upon them where necessary. The\r\nPhilippines would support efforts in this regard,\r\nbearing in mind that the Working Group, aside from the\r\nplenary itself, remains the General Assembly’s sole\r\ndeliberative body on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. In this regard, under the chairmanship of the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, Harry\r\nHolkeri, and the two Vice-Chairmen, Ambassadors\r\nIngolfsson and de Saram, innovations such as the\r\ninteractive debate with members of the Security\r\nCouncil and meetings with the Secretariat officials\r\ndirectly assisting the Council have, in our view,\r\ngenerated fresh perspectives into the Working Group’s\r\ndeliberations, and have created a greater appreciation\r\nof the issues being considered by the Working Group.\r\nThese exchanges should continue at the Working\r\nGroup’s future sessions. The interactive exchange\r\ncould also be broadened to consider issues aside from\r\nthe working methods and procedures of the Council.\r\nThe establishment of the Working Group eight\r\nyears ago brought a sense of expectation and hope that\r\nthe United Nations would be able to provide the global\r\ncommunity with a more representative and transparent\r\nSecurity Council. Despite the number of years spent in\r\nnegotiating the reform, the Philippines remains\r\nconfident that a package agreement can still be\r\nachieved within a reasonable time. But it is necessary\r\nto set the stage for serious negotiations involving trade-\r\noffs. We therefore believe the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup should, at the outset of its next session, identify\r\nthose elements or issues where general agreement\r\nalready exists or can be achieved in the near term, and\r\nthen focus its attention on those issues where further\r\nwork is clearly needed.\r\nIn practical terms, this means reaffirming, as\r\nappropriate, those issues where general preliminary\r\nagreement already exists, subject, of course, to an\r\noverall package agreement. In this regard, we have in\r\nmind a number of cluster II issues. The Working Group\r\nshould therefore focus its deliberations at its next\r\nsession on matters such as the size and composition of\r\nan expanded Council, the extension of and the\r\nlimitation of the use of the veto and certain outstanding\r\ncluster II issues, such as measures to ensure greater\r\nparticipation of troop-contributing countries in\r\npeacekeeping operation decision-making, measures to\r\ncreate greater transparency of the informal\r\nconsultations of the whole and improving the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council to the General Assembly.\r\nThis approach would, in our view, more precisely\r\nhighlight those specific issues that need to be resolved\r\nin order to complete an acceptable package agreement\r\nas well as enable the membership to devote more time\r\nto considering them. This approach should also entail\r\nagreement to drop from the Working Group’s\r\nconsideration certain proposals that clearly have\r\nelicited scant or no support over the years. In our view,\r\nthe Working Group would only squander its valuable\r\ntime in revisiting these proposals. In other words, the\r\nkey issues should still be on the table, but not every\r\nsingle proposal made over the past eight years.\r\nHopefully, this approach will enable the Working\r\nGroup to begin serious consideration of negotiating\r\ntexts or language on the outstanding issues.\r\nMr. Seixas da Costa (Portugal): The reform of\r\nthe Security Council is once again on the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, for the twenty-second consecutive\r\nyear. We have before us, as a framework for the debate,\r\nthe report of the Open-ended Working Group. This\r\nreport, with its annexes, reflects almost a decade of\r\nintense discussion on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. However, the results are meagre.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is surely a\r\ncomplex issue. The objective, nevertheless, remains\r\nclear: to review the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil in view of the substantial increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations, as well as the\r\nchanges in international relations. This is the mandate\r\nof the Open-ended Working Group, as set out by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1993. At that time, we were in the\r\nearly stages of a new era of international relations,\r\ntriggered by the end of the cold war. Also, at that time\r\nthe United Nations membership, since the last reform\r\nof the Security Council, had increased by almost 40 per\r\ncent. Nevertheless, today, almost a decade later, these\r\nsignificant changes have yet to be reflected in the\r\ncomposition of the Council.\r\nI must recognize, however, that important efforts\r\nhave been undertaken to move the process forward.\r\nThe mobilization of this Assembly in 1998 was one\r\nsuch effort, and it resulted in the unanimous adoption\r\nof resolution 53/30. That resolution was crucial in\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nclarifying the two-thirds majority rule necessary for\r\ndecisions pertaining to the reform.\r\nOn the other side, the commitment of your\r\npredecessor, Mr. President, President Holkeri, and the\r\nother members of the Bureau, were of the utmost\r\nimportance in helping to distil the main elements under\r\ndiscussion on both clusters. My delegation commends\r\nparticularly their efforts in preparing the set of useful\r\ndocuments that are now attached to the report. These\r\nwill enable us to better focus our discussions in the\r\nfuture.\r\nAt a higher political level, the process of the\r\nreform of the Security Council was given a particular\r\nboost during the Millennium Summit. At that time, our\r\nHeads of State and Government gathered to adopt the\r\nMillennium Declaration and expressed the commitment\r\nto intensify their efforts to achieve a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Council in all its aspects. The main\r\nelements for reform are now on the table. With the\r\npolitical will thus expressed, our delegations should\r\nnow be able to build an appropriate solution.\r\nThe Security Council has been confronted in the\r\nlast decade with an increasing number of situations and\r\nconflicts in different parts of the world. The latest\r\nterrorist attacks constitute an unprecedented challenge\r\nto the international community, calling for concerted\r\naction in which the Security Council plays a central\r\nrole. To better deal with such complex situations, the\r\nSecurity Council, as the body primarily responsible for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security, has to be\r\nregarded as a legitimate body, acting on behalf of the\r\nwhole international community and with full\r\ntransparency. Enhancing its representative nature and\r\nimproving its methods of work are therefore the crucial\r\nelements for reinforcing Council authority and the\r\neffectiveness of its decisions. Today, more than ever,\r\nwe must conclude the process of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, as we need to have a strong body that\r\nis really representative of the international community.\r\nIn his statement to the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Holkeri alluded precisely to\r\nthis. Encouraged by the clear support received from\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs for the continuation of\r\nefforts on Security Council reform, he highlighted the\r\nneed to consider all the avenues that would advance the\r\nprocess and put forward suggestions to that effect.\r\nPortugal supports this thrust and is open to suggestions\r\nthat may be useful for moving forward the process of\r\nthe reform of the Security Council.\r\nIt could be helpful, for example, to take this\r\nsubject to a higher political level of debate if we\r\ncontinue to experience serious difficulties in advancing\r\nthe negotiations in the Working Group. This, in our\r\nview, could help to streamline the discussions and to\r\nregain the political momentum created by the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nFor our part, we remain ready to engage actively\r\nin the next steps of the negotiations. However, we must\r\nbear in mind the need to address the question of reform\r\nin all its aspects. We should remind ourselves of the\r\nneed to tackle this question as a package and to achieve\r\nwhat was asked of us — a comprehensive reform of the\r\nCouncil in all its aspects, not a reform in only certain\r\naspects of its work.\r\nThis is a special time at which we all must show\r\nflexibility in order to reach a solution that garners the\r\ngeneral support of the membership. We must do so in\r\nthe interest of the international community. This should\r\napply to all issues, from the question of numbers to the\r\nquestion of the veto.\r\nIndeed, to achieve a comprehensive solution, the\r\nquestion of the veto must be addressed in the light of\r\nthe overwhelming support of the general membership\r\nfor reform in this regard. The fact is that, while used\r\nformally very moderately in recent times, the veto, or\r\nthe threat of its use, continues to be present in every\r\naspect of the Council’s decision-making process.\r\nPortugal, together with other countries, submitted\r\na number of very concrete proposals to the Working\r\nGroup with regard to the restriction of the use of the\r\nveto. These proposals remain valid, realistic and\r\nworthy of consideration. We hope we will be able to\r\nfind the necessary flexibility in our consideration of\r\nthis matter, as we are receiving new positive signals\r\nfrom among the permanent members, indicating some\r\ndegree of openness to considering restrictions on the\r\nuse of this power.\r\nWith your commitment, Mr. President, we are\r\nconfident that it will be possible to keep the subject of\r\nSecurity Council reform a high priority on the\r\ninternational agenda and to allow the United Nations\r\ngeneral membership to move the process to the next\r\nstep.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nThe United Nations urgently needs to adapt to the\r\nrealities of the new century. Its role as a vital\r\ninstrument for the political regulation of the\r\nglobalization process and as an indispensable tool for\r\norganizing common efforts to face new challenges\r\nrequires a set of new and constructive ideas to\r\nrevitalize the Organization. We very much count on the\r\nAssembly’s contribution to that aim.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): In recent years, this has been one of the\r\nagenda items on which the greatest number of\r\ndelegations have participated. During the fifty-fifth\r\nsession, we heard over 110 statements and the number\r\nis very high again this year. That is evidence of the\r\npriority importance attached to this item. The reasons\r\nfor that are obvious. Security Council reform is\r\nundoubtedly the most delicate task in the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole, and its outcome will have\r\nthe greatest impact on the future of this Organization.\r\nWe need a Security Council that is truly able to\r\nfulfil the important responsibilities assigned to it by the\r\nCharter. The power to decide on the application of\r\ncoercive measures against States, including sanctions\r\nor even military action, requires impartiality,\r\nrepresentativeness and legitimacy. The Security\r\nCouncil is not and will not be able to be effective with\r\nits current composition and working methods. It\r\nrequires profound and urgent reform because it is\r\nneither democratic, nor equitable nor representative. It\r\nneither reflects the realities of the contemporary world\r\nnor represents the interests of the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet us be clear about this: the Security Council of\r\ntoday is efficient only in safeguarding the interests of\r\nthe permanent members. The situation is even more\r\ndisturbing when that same unrepresentative Council\r\nassumes increasingly broad functions and invades\r\npurviews that actually fall to other organs, mainly the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe number of States Members of the United\r\nNations has grown almost fourfold since 1945.\r\nNonetheless, it has been almost 35 years since the\r\nnumber of members of the Council increased from 11\r\nto the present 15, in spite of the fact that, since that last\r\nexpansion, 76 new Members have joined the United\r\nNations. At the present time, the membership of the\r\nCouncil constitutes barely 8 per cent of the total\r\nmembership of the Organization.\r\nA Security Council with fewer than 26 members\r\nwill not be able to redress the current imbalances. That\r\nis why a minimum of 11 new seats should be created.\r\nAlthough this figure would remain lower than that of\r\nsimilar organs in other international organizations, it\r\nwould raise the membership of the Council to some 13\r\nper cent of the total membership of the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council must be expanded to\r\ninclude new permanent and non-permanent members.\r\nAn increase in the number of non-permanent members\r\nalone would only heighten the current imbalance. As\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement has affirmed, if no\r\nagreement is achieved on other categories, for the time\r\nbeing only the number of non-permanent members\r\nshould be increased.\r\nCuba is not in favour of the creation of other\r\ncategories of membership in the Security Council. The\r\nnew permanent and non-permanent seats to be created\r\nin the Council through reform must enjoy exactly the\r\nsame prerogatives as the current ones, without the\r\nestablishment of discriminatory criteria. In any\r\nbroadening of the category of permanent membership,\r\na minimum of two African, two Latin American and\r\nCaribbean and two developing Asian countries should\r\nbe included. The fundamental objective of the\r\nexpansion of that organ should be to correct the under-\r\nrepresentation of the developing countries.\r\nI should like to dwell on that point for a moment,\r\nbecause we sometimes have the impression that its\r\nimportance is not grasped equally by all. How can the\r\nSecurity Council be expected to have a correct\r\nunderstanding of the profound underlying causes of\r\nconflicts, and therefore effectively deal with those\r\nconflicts, when two thirds of the world’s population,\r\nliving in the developing countries, are severely under-\r\nrepresented in the Council? How is it possible for the\r\nCouncil to fulfil its responsibility in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security if it does not\r\nadequately represent those 4.5 billion persons who live\r\nin the third world, a billion of whom are hungry, three\r\nfifths of whom have no sanitation services, one third of\r\nwhom have no drinking water, one quarter of whom\r\nhave no housing and one fifth of whom have no basic\r\nhealth services? How do we explain the fact that\r\nAfrica, whose conflicts occupy most of the items on\r\nthe Council’s agenda, does not have a single\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nrepresentative among the permanent members of that\r\norgan?\r\nThe need for greater transparency in the work of\r\nthe Council is urgent. In a world that is increasingly\r\ninterdependent, the decisions taken by that organ have\r\ngrowing implications, direct and indirect, for all\r\nMember States. Not only is it necessary to increase the\r\nnumber of open meetings; those must also offer\r\ngenuine opportunities to non-members of the Council\r\nto make useful contributions.\r\nWe have seen with increasing frequency the\r\nconvening of open debates in the Council that, in the\r\nlong run, have no impact on the resolutions and\r\npresidential statements that are adopted because the\r\ntexts have been agreed in advance behind closed doors\r\nby its members.\r\nThe Council’s rules of procedure urgently need to\r\nbe amended and formally adopted. Fifty-five years\r\nafter their establishment and 19 after their last\r\namendment, the rules of procedure should no longer be\r\nprovisional. The measures already adopted by the\r\nCouncil or applied in practice should be\r\ninstitutionalized and consolidated, instead of being\r\never dependent on the changing views of the month’s\r\nPresident of that organ. This year, some progress has\r\nbeen made in the Open-ended Working Group in\r\nconnection with so-called cluster II items. Let us hope\r\nthat this will contribute to progress on remaining\r\nissues.\r\nAs for cluster I, in expressing frustration at the\r\nlack of progress on certain items, some delegations\r\nhave said that nothing can be done while the permanent\r\nmembers continue to refuse to consider the least\r\nlimitation in the use of the veto. Cuba does not share\r\nthat approach. The Charter does not give permanent\r\nmembers absolute powers. On the contrary, Article 24\r\nexplicitly states that the Security Council acts on\r\nbehalf of all Member States and that, in discharging its\r\nduties, the Security Council shall act in accordance\r\nwith the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nIf these requirements are not met, the General\r\nAssembly has the right and the duty to act. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that the General Assembly be\r\nrevitalized and that it assume all its Charter powers as\r\nthe sole organ of the United Nations in which all\r\nMember States participate, in which there is no place\r\nfor hegemonism and in which the obsolete privilege of\r\nthe veto does not exist.\r\nThe subject of the veto has a central place in the\r\nreform of the Council. Currently, the mere opposition\r\nof a permanent member can prevent the will of the\r\nother 188 Member States from being carried out. The\r\nveto is exercised or threatened only when there is\r\ndisagreement with the majority, which is anti-\r\ndemocratic in its very essence. No one can seriously\r\nallege that, in the roughly 290 times that the veto has\r\nbeen formally used, it has been so in the interests of the\r\ninternational community, in accordance with Article 24\r\nof the Charter.\r\nFurthermore, the problem resides not only in\r\nformal and public uses of the veto, but also in the so-\r\ncalled silent vetoes, which are frequently exercised in\r\nthe so-called informal consultations, where it is often\r\nenough for a permanent member to express\r\ndisagreement in order for a course of action favoured\r\nby the majority to be altered. Until the final objective\r\nof eliminating the veto is achieved, it is necessary as a\r\nfirst step to amend the United Nations Charter to limit\r\nthe veto to those actions that are taken under Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter.\r\nEvery new international crisis reminds us of the\r\nweaknesses of the Council and its practices. Many\r\ndelegations have expressed their concern at the letter\r\nrecently sent to the Security Council by one of its\r\npermanent members following the initiation of military\r\naction in Afghanistan, in which it was brazenly\r\nindicated that other countries might be attacked by that\r\npermanent member as a result of the events of 11\r\nSeptember.\r\nThere was no reply to the letter. How protected\r\ncan we feel with a Security Council that does not react,\r\neven timidly, in the face of such threats, which are\r\nentirely contrary to the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter? We cannot expect any real leadership from a\r\nbody in which some of the permanent members\r\npractise double standards and selective policies, giving\r\npriority to narrow national interests instead of global\r\ninterests.\r\nThe same Council that acted immediately as a\r\nresult of the events of 11 September was not prepared\r\neven to consider many other terrorist acts that occurred\r\nin the past, such as the criminal sabotage in full flight\r\nof the Cubana de Aviación aircraft near Barbados,\r\nwhich cost the lives of 73 passengers and crew\r\nmembers.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.33\r\nIt is the same Council that is completely\r\nparalysed in the face of the critical situation in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories, as a result of which\r\nhundreds of innocent civilians have already died,\r\nowing to the objection by a single permanent member\r\nto taking measures.\r\nIt is the same Council that discusses and approves\r\ndocuments on small arms and light weapons, but does\r\nabsolutely nothing about nuclear weapons. How can we\r\nbe expected to view as legitimate norms of conduct\r\ndictated by the Security Council, when some of its\r\nmembers are responsible for the fact that there are\r\nmore than 30,000 nuclear weapons in the world,\r\ndirectly threatening the international peace and security\r\nthat the Council is supposed to defend?\r\nWhile reaffirming our firm condemnation of the\r\nterrorist acts of 11 September, we hope that the speed\r\nand magnitude of the response to those events will\r\nextend to the other grave problems affecting us. That\r\nsame day, just as many other regrettable events occur\r\nin the world every 24 hours, all year long, more than\r\n33,000 children under the age of five died from\r\ndiseases that are absolutely preventable, and almost\r\n70,000 more destitute people joined the hungry masses\r\nin the world. There were no minutes of silence for\r\nthem, no emergency meetings of the Security Council.\r\nNo committee was established in record time to begin\r\nto take urgent measures to deal with those situations.\r\nWe hope that during this session we will be able\r\nhonour the mandate approved by our heads of State and\r\nGovernment during the Millennium Summit, by\r\nintensifying work to achieve a truly comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects.\r\nI conclude by expressing thanks to Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri and to Ambassadors John de Saram and\r\nThorsteinn Ingólfsson for the excellent way in which\r\nthey led the Working Group during the fifty-fifth\r\nsession, and by wishing every success to the new\r\nBureau elected to guide the Group’s work.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat the second item originally scheduled for this\r\nafternoon — agenda item 26, “Follow-up to the\r\noutcome of the special session on children” — for the\r\npurpose of considering draft resolution A/56/L.7, will\r\nbe taken up at a later date to allow time for the\r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions and the Fifth Committee to consider the\r\nprogramme budget implications pertaining to draft\r\nresolution A/56/L.7.\r\nThe General Assembly will be informed in due\r\ncourse of the date for which agenda item 26 will be\r\nrescheduled to consider draft resolution A/56/L.7.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
