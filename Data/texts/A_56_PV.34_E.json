(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 49 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is today discussing one of the most\r\nimportant items on its agenda: the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters. Last session’s\r\nreport (A/55/47) was the result of long discussions in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on this item. In that\r\nconnection, we express great respect and admiration\r\nfor the great effort exerted by the then Chairman, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession, Mr. Harri Holkeri, and his two Vice-Chairmen,\r\nwho so ably guided the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group.\r\nThe Group’s discussions during the fifty-fifth\r\nsession highlighted the urgency of restructuring the\r\nSecurity Council, a principal organ of the United\r\nNations, with a view to enhancing the transparency of\r\nits working methods. All the working documents\r\nsubmitted in the course of the Group’s meetings by\r\ndelegations, organizations and regional groups, taken\r\ntogether, indicated how essential it is that we reform\r\nthe Security Council in order to strengthen its role in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nto make it better suited to facing the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nBut owing to lack of agreement among Member\r\nStates on the basic principles of reform and because of\r\nchanges made after eight years of discussion — in spite\r\nof agreement that had earlier been achieved — it has\r\nproved impossible to agree on the nature of the changes\r\nrequired with respect to the number of new Council\r\nmembers and to the Council’s working methods. Yet\r\nwe cannot ignore the fact that real progress was made\r\nduring the discussions, particularly on the question of\r\nthe Council’s procedures and working methods. There\r\nwas almost universal agreement on a number of the\r\nprocedures and other proposals under discussion and\r\non some of the changes that ought to made in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods. In fact, the Council has\r\nindeed adopted some new procedures and working\r\nmethods.\r\nKuwait has often stated its position on the\r\nquestion of an increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and improvements in its working\r\nmethods, either on its own or collectively through the\r\norganizations of which Kuwait is a member. Today’s\r\ndebate provides yet another opportunity for us to\r\nreaffirm our position, which is based on the following\r\nprinciples.\r\nFirst, Kuwait supports an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, although the\r\nnumber of members should not be too large to maintain\r\nthe Council’s efficiency and effectiveness as it plays its\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nrole in decision-making and in confronting conflicts\r\nthat threaten international peace and security.\r\nSecondly, however the membership of the\r\nCouncil is increased, it must be consistent with the\r\nprinciples of State sovereignty and equitable\r\ngeographical distribution. The new makeup of the\r\nSecurity Council should reflect the universal character\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThirdly, with respect to an increase in the number\r\nof permanent members of the Security Council, we\r\nagree that such an increase should be limited. We\r\nconsider that the criteria we should use to decide\r\nwhether a State shall be a permanent member include\r\nproof, through its relations with the United Nations, of\r\nits ability to shoulder responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to\r\nimplement the principles and purposes of the United\r\nNations Charter in the political, economic, social and\r\ncultural spheres. It is the General Assembly that, in\r\naccordance with criteria and procedures to be agreed\r\nupon, should decide which States are to become\r\npermanent members.\r\nFourthly, in connection with reform of the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and procedures and\r\nimprovement of links between the Security Council\r\nand other United Nations organs, specifically the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we entirely agree with all proposals\r\naimed at increasing transparency and clarity in the\r\nCouncil’s work. We would support any proposal that\r\nmade for a more flexible flow of information between\r\nCouncil members and other Members of the United\r\nNations. Here, we stress the importance of codifying\r\nthe Security Council’s working procedures and any\r\nprocedures that may be agreed upon in the Working\r\nGroup. That should take place without waiting for\r\ncomplete agreement on other issues such as the size\r\nand composition of the Council, the decision-making\r\nprocess, et cetera.\r\nFifthly, Kuwait would support retaining the\r\nmechanism by which we elect non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council, which is in accordance with\r\nArticle 23, paragraph 2, of the Charter. After all, that\r\nmechanism enables smaller States such as Kuwait more\r\nreadily to become members of the Security Council and\r\nto contribute to its work.\r\nFinally, we are very well aware that the issue of\r\nthe right of veto is a thorny and sensitive one. We have\r\nseen nearly complete agreement emerge in the Working\r\nGroup on the need to regulate the way in which the\r\nright of veto is used. Many significant proposals have\r\nbeen made; these certainly are worthy of fuller\r\ndiscussion. We hope it will be possible to agree on\r\nwording that would be satisfactory to all parties and\r\nthat would enable the Security Council to carry out its\r\nfunctions without hindrance.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that discussions in the\r\nWorking Group will lead to the kind of consensus that\r\nwill guarantee an enhanced and strengthened role for\r\nthe Security Council in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and in facing the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. To that end, the\r\ndelegation of Kuwait will play an active role in future\r\ndiscussions in the Working Group. We hope that the\r\nGroup’s work will be crowned with success.\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): Only two short weeks ago, the\r\nGeneral Assembly examined the annual report of the\r\nSecurity Council, issuing an almost unanimous\r\nappeal — I would even say there was true general\r\nagreement — for greater transparency and participation\r\nin the workings of that body. Our debate today can thus\r\nbe seen as a logical extension of our deliberations on\r\n15 and 16 October, and it forces us to ask why so many\r\ncountries continue to appeal for Security Council\r\nreform.\r\nThe immediate answer is that deep changes, both\r\nin international relations and in the role and function of\r\nthe United Nations, make a pressing, inevitable case\r\nfor the Security Council — the body assigned with\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security — to undergo\r\ncomprehensive reform in all its aspects.\r\nWhen the exercise on Security Council reform\r\nbegan more than eight years ago, shortly after the end\r\nof the cold war, there were those who thought that it\r\nshould amount to little more than an alteration in the\r\ncomposition of the Council through the creation of new\r\npermanent members. To their mind, issues like\r\ntransparency, accountability, participation, effectiveness\r\nand the assessment of Security Council’s work seemed\r\nmarginal. According to this approach, the hereditary\r\nprerogatives of permanency — some call them “special\r\nresponsibilities” — created during the unique,\r\nunrepeatable conditions of the years after the Second\r\nWorld War could be updated with a quick fix by\r\nanointing a select few to enter the club.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nThis unilateral approach, which runs counter to\r\nthe principle of equality between United Nations\r\nMembers and to the movement towards growing\r\nlegitimacy in international relations, was ultimately\r\ndefeated. There will be no new countries that are “more\r\nequal” than others, because the vast majority of United\r\nNations Members are calling for a different type of\r\nreform. They want to close the gap between the\r\n“haves” and the “have-nots”, whether individual States\r\nor large regions of the world. This vast majority of\r\nUnited Nations Members therefore rejects any new\r\nelevation of States — however unlikely that may be —\r\nthat would penalize 180 other countries in order to\r\nrealize the ambitions of the newly anointed. Whatever\r\nmargins for disagreement might exist, I am sure we\r\ncould all agree that such a manoeuvre would hardly\r\nmake the Council’s actions more timely and effective.\r\nThe time has come to see who is really holding the\r\nreform process hostage by pursuing maximalist claims\r\nthat reject any and all compromise solutions.\r\nEight years of debate have proved that effective\r\nSecurity Council reform must primarily address the\r\nworking methods and decision-making processes of\r\nthat body, rather than seek to increase the number of\r\nprivileged members. The Security Council represents a\r\nsocial contract of sorts: on the inside, this confers\r\ninternational legitimacy on its members; on the outside,\r\nmany others stand ready to lend effectiveness to the\r\nactions of the Council in exchange for participation in\r\nthe decision-making process. A proper balance\r\nbetween legitimacy, participation and effectiveness is\r\nthe core of the reform. If this contract is broken, the\r\nCouncil will cease to function properly.\r\nNew global threats to peace, such as international\r\nterrorism, have ushered in a new era, and require a\r\ndifferent type of global governance based on a strong\r\nand resolute culture of consensus: collective decision-\r\nmaking and global responsibility in place of the\r\nunilateral promotion of narrow national interests. The\r\nbusiness of the Security Council needs true leadership,\r\nbased on objectivity, collegiality and unity of intent.\r\nIncreasing the number of countries endowed with veto\r\npower is hardly the way to restore credibility and\r\naccountability. Enlargement cannot happen at the\r\nexpense of effectiveness. On the other hand, increasing\r\nthe number of permanent members without veto power\r\nwould be merely cosmetic and frivolous.\r\nThe habit of expanded informal consultations is\r\njust one demonstration of how the work of the Security\r\nCouncil depends on the paramount influence of\r\npermanent members — transparency and structural\r\ncomposition are closely related. This is why reform has\r\nto move forward, not selectively but as a common\r\npackage. Elected members are hardly the ones to\r\nbenefit from such opaque working methods. That trend\r\nfavours instead those members who can threaten to use,\r\nor abuse, their veto. Therefore, adding new permanent\r\nmembers would increase the existing frustration of\r\nelected members, which feel marginalized from real\r\ndecision-making when called on to ratify measures\r\nalready prepared in restricted forums.\r\nFrom the start of the exercise, Italy thought that\r\nthe best solution would be to increase the number of\r\nnon-permanent members only. The addition of a\r\nlimited number of elected seats would make the\r\nSecurity Council more representative of the large\r\nregions of the world currently underrepresented, and\r\nallow a fair rotation for those countries who shoulder\r\ngreater responsibilities in terms of financial resources,\r\ntroops for peace operations led or authorized by the\r\nUnited Nations and political support for stabilization\r\nprocesses and peace agreements. After 10 years of\r\nheavy commitment to bringing peace to the Balkans,\r\nItaly’s experience as a front-line country has taught us\r\nthat the Security Council should more closely involve\r\ncountries whose interests are especially affected, as\r\ndescribed in Article 31 of the Charter. The key to\r\nmaking progress in the Security Council reform\r\nprocess lies in the greater involvement of non-\r\nmembers, as well as increased interaction with other\r\nUnited Nations and international bodies.\r\nThe recent progress in the Security Council’s\r\npractices and operations leads us to suggest that we\r\nshould all consider the regional dimension of the\r\nreform process. What is the meaning of equitable\r\nregional representation in the twenty-first century? The\r\nSecurity Council, for example, is working increasingly\r\nin close contact with representatives of the European\r\nUnion on issues of conflict prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding. With the development of European crisis-\r\nmanagement capabilities, including a military rapid\r\nreaction force, relations between the European Union\r\nand the United Nations are set to grow significantly in\r\nthe area of peacekeeping and conflict resolution, with\r\nmodalities of interaction between the European Union\r\nand the Security Council also increasing in the\r\ndefinition of mandates. This has begun to happen in\r\nseveral regional crises, not only in Europe — in areas\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nsuch as the Balkans, as attested to by the recent\r\nresolution 1371 (2001) on The former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia — but also in Africa and the\r\nMiddle East, as recognized in the Security Council’s\r\npress statement issued last Friday. In all these cases the\r\nSecurity Council welcomes and supports the efforts of\r\nthe European Union to promote peace and stability.\r\nItaly is a strong supporter of European Union\r\nefforts to better coordinate its common foreign and\r\nsecurity policy, including in the Security Council. The\r\nrepeated calls for strengthening the voice of Europe in\r\ninternational forums significantly narrow the margins\r\nfor national policy differences. Even in some\r\ninfluential non-European quarters, the call has been\r\nissued for Europeans to work out a more reasonable\r\nsystem of representation among themselves. This is\r\nconsistent with the position Italy has staunchly\r\nmaintained on the issue of Security Council expansion.\r\nWe will continue to work constructively in the only\r\nappropriate forum, the Open-ended Working Group,\r\ntowards the reform inspired by the above criteria, and\r\nwe appreciate that a growing number of countries share\r\nthis approach.\r\nMr. Hughes (New Zealand): We are pleased to\r\nsee once again the long list of speakers inscribed for\r\nthis item. While our attention in the weeks following\r\nthe events of 11 September has perhaps been largely\r\nfocused elsewhere, as others have remarked previously,\r\nthe Security Council’s leading role in the international\r\neffort to stamp out terrorism underlines the importance\r\nof the issues we are discussing today.\r\nGood progress was made in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform during the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I would\r\nlike to pay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. President,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, and the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group, Ambassadors Thorsteinn Ingólfsson\r\nand John de Saram, for their tireless efforts. The\r\nGeneral Assembly has in particular welcomed the\r\nprogress achieved during the fifty-fifth session in the\r\nconsideration of the issues dealing with the Council’s\r\nworking methods, where provisional agreement has\r\nbeen recorded on a large number of points. We need to\r\nkeep building on this, and under your leadership,\r\nMr. President, I am sure we will.\r\nLike many others, we were pleased to see\r\nmembers of the Security Council, for the second year\r\nin a row, meet with the Open-ended Working Group to\r\ndiscuss steps taken by the Council to promote greater\r\nopenness and transparency. This proved to be one of\r\nthe most substantive meetings of the Working Group\r\nduring the fifty-fifth session. We hope that the practice\r\nof Council members being invited to meet with the\r\nWorking Group will continue during this session. There\r\nmay indeed be other avenues by which we can promote\r\nconstructive synergies between the Council and the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group. For example, would it be\r\npossible for members of the Council’s working group\r\non documentation and procedure to come to the Open-\r\nended Working Group next year to provide a briefing\r\non their work programme, given the overlapping\r\ninterests that we share?\r\nThere could also be merit, perhaps, in the\r\nCouncil’s Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations\r\nentering into a dialogue with the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on issues of common concern — for example,\r\nhow to ensure the greater involvement of troop\r\ncontributors in decisions affecting the use of their\r\ncontingents on peacekeeping operations.\r\nDuring the past year, the Secretariat also made a\r\nvaluable contribution to the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup’s understanding of how the Council’s informal\r\nconsultations are serviced. It was of considerable\r\ninterest to many delegations to learn that the\r\nSecretariat does in fact keep records of these\r\nconsultations. How these notes are stored and the\r\nregulations governing access to them will be matters\r\nthat delegations will surely wish to pursue during the\r\nsession ahead.\r\nWhile the General Assembly was able to note the\r\ngood progress made on issues dealing with the\r\nCouncil’s working methods, it was also obliged to\r\nrecord that substantial differences of view remained on\r\nother issues. An area of central concern continues to be\r\nthe veto. As a founding Member of the Organization,\r\nNew Zealand was opposed to the veto, and we still are.\r\nThe reluctance of the permanent members to\r\ncountenance any curtailment of this power is not\r\nhelping the reform process. We also believe that\r\nextending the veto power to any other Member States\r\nwould not be consistent with the wishes of the\r\nmajority. The issues posed by the veto are very\r\ndifficult, and it is hard to see any way around them. So\r\nlong as a small number of Member States insist on\r\nacquiring the veto power for themselves, progress\r\ntowards enlargement is likely to remain stalled.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nAs for the issue of equitable representation more\r\nbroadly, we continue to think that the time is fast\r\napproaching for a complete overhaul of the\r\nanachronistic, and in many cases dysfunctional,\r\nregional groups. We believe that reform in this area\r\ncould contribute to bringing the Council’s\r\nrepresentativeness into line with the modern world.\r\nFinally, I would like to say a few words about the\r\nidea of “periodic review”, which continues to be part of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group’s agenda. New\r\nZealand is certainly not opposed to the idea of a future\r\nreview of any arrangements which might eventually be\r\nagreed as an outcome of the current reform process.\r\nIndeed, we could be said to have been engaged in a\r\nreview of previously agreed arrangements for these\r\npast eight years or so in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup.\r\nBut when it comes to the question of the possible\r\nextension of the veto, there is little doubt that the\r\nsignificance of the promise of a future review is\r\nessentially psychological. As the distinguished German\r\njurist Bruno Simma noted in his landmark commentary\r\non the Charter of the United Nations, the review\r\nconcept was a major factor in overcoming the\r\nresistance of many smaller and medium-sized countries\r\nto the veto at San Francisco. To quote Professor\r\nSimma, “the prospect of a review conference in the\r\nforeseeable future, when the cards would be reshuffled,\r\ngave them consolation and hope”. Well, I think we can\r\nbe forgiven for not being so naïve again 56 years later.\r\nThe Millennium Summit last year provided us\r\nwith a mandate to intensify our efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. Despite the continuing obstacle posed by the\r\nveto, we believe the Open-ended Working Group has\r\nonce again shown its worth over the past year and\r\nremains the appropriate forum for discussion of this\r\nitem. As we said last year, we believe the broad outline\r\nof a reform package is discernible. The Open-ended\r\nWorking Group’s key characteristics of inclusiveness\r\nand transparency will ensure that the reform package\r\nwhich will eventually be arrived at will have general\r\nagreement and will be sustainable. Anything less would\r\nrisk doing grave harm to the United Nations.\r\nMr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nreform of the Security Council is one of the most\r\ncomplex and politically sensitive issues facing the\r\nOrganization. Its outcome will without any doubt affect\r\nthe system of collective security. That is why the\r\nsolution we arrive at must be acceptable to all — that is\r\nto say, it must be reached by consensus without\r\nartificial deadlines or divisions. Otherwise, the reform\r\nwill lack the necessary political legitimacy; or what is\r\nmore, it will worsen the crisis of legitimacy that\r\ncurrently affects the Security Council. In this context,\r\nwe are convinced that the Working Group established\r\nby the General Assembly remains the right forum to\r\nachieve this purpose. We therefore reiterate our\r\ncommitment to work actively and constructively until\r\nwe reach a general agreement on each and every item\r\nin the mandate of the Working Group.\r\nThe vast majority of delegations want a more\r\ndemocratic, representative and transparent Security\r\nCouncil — one that is better prepared to face the\r\nsecurity challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nNonetheless, we have not yet made enough progress,\r\nparticularly on issues related to the veto and to the\r\nexpansion of the membership of the Council. Allow me\r\nto share some thoughts on the reasons for this delay.\r\nThe veto is an institution at variance with the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States and in\r\nflagrant contradiction with the democratic principles\r\nthat the Council itself promotes in the settlement of\r\ndisputes under its consideration. From the many\r\ndebates held over the years, it is clear that the\r\noverwhelming majority of States want the elimination\r\nof the veto or, at the very minimum, its restriction.\r\nOnly a very small minority remains attached to\r\nmaximalist positions and rejects any modification of\r\nthe veto whatsoever. That same minority states that,\r\nsince the end of the cold war, the veto has seldom been\r\nused; that the question of the veto is not an important\r\none at this stage of the reform process; and that we can\r\ntherefore deal with it later. But why, then, if the\r\nquestion of the veto is so irrelevant, is there such\r\ntremendous resistance to changing it?\r\nFrom our recent experience in the Security\r\nCouncil, we have learned that, even though the veto\r\nhas not been used very much in recent years, the threat\r\nof its use — the so-called pocket veto — has had\r\nalmost the same counterproductive effects as the veto\r\nitself. The “pocket veto” is used more frequently than\r\nthe permanent members would like to admit. On more\r\nthan one occasion, the negotiation of a draft resolution\r\nhas been aborted or delayed, or the text changed\r\nsubstantially, because of the mere threat of a veto.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nObviously, Argentina is clearly against the veto.\r\nWe think that it is necessary to limit its scope, as the\r\nfirst step towards its eventual elimination. For the time\r\nbeing, a reasonable limitation of the veto may be to\r\nrestrict its application exclusively to Chapter VII\r\nissues, in which case the permanent members would\r\nhave to explain to the General Assembly their reasons\r\nfor having cast the veto. In our opinion, these\r\nlimitations must be established through amendments to\r\nthe Charter. A political commitment is not enough of a\r\nlegal guarantee. Even a unilateral legal declaration\r\ncannot prevail over the principle of the supremacy of\r\nCharter provisions, in accordance with Article 103.\r\nWe have said that the reform of the Council is a\r\npackage deal, to be taken as a whole. We must\r\ntherefore not encourage any artificial division of\r\nproposals, such as postponing the question of the veto\r\nto a later stage and concentrating now on increasing the\r\nmembership alone. Both issues are inseparably linked,\r\nand we deem it unacceptable that an issue of such\r\nimportance as the veto, over which there is general\r\nagreement, should be isolated from the rest of the\r\nissues concerning reform.\r\nBut how it is possible to make a decision on\r\nincreasing the membership of an organ as politically\r\nimportant as the Security Council without a previous\r\nagreement on the decision-making process of that\r\norgan? That is why we should bear in mind that the real\r\nreason for the delay in the Working Group is clear. The\r\ndelay is due to an obstructionist minority that is\r\nopposed to any restriction of the veto, and not to the\r\nvast majority of States that want a more democratic\r\nSecurity Council. If certain Members are not ready to\r\nadmit that, under present historical circumstances,\r\nthere is no room for the arrangements of 1945, reform,\r\nI fear, will continue to be delayed.\r\nWe believe that the purpose of the reform is to\r\nallow for greater participation by all Member States. It\r\nwould be anachronistic if, in the twenty-first century,\r\nwe were to multiply privileges and discriminations that\r\nonly the exceptional circumstances of the Second\r\nWorld War could have justified. That is why we believe\r\nthat we must not perpetuate the inequalities of the past\r\nby establishing new permanent seats following the\r\nmodel of 1945. That would mean that we would have\r\nmembers that do not need to be elected by the General\r\nAssembly to serve in the Council; members that are not\r\naccountable to the rest of the membership; and\r\nmembers that enjoy the privilege of veto. An increase\r\nin the permanent membership would exacerbate\r\nexisting imbalances and would run counter to the right\r\nof every Member to elect, and be elected, to participate\r\nin the system of collective security.\r\nAfter eight years of debate, it is clear that existing\r\ndifferences on the expansion of the membership of the\r\nCouncil are mainly related to an increase in the\r\ncategory of permanent members. There is no doubt that\r\nthis is closely connected with the question of the veto.\r\nSo far, we have not heard any proposals on an increase\r\nin the category of permanent members that are not at\r\nvariance with the democratic principles supported by\r\nits sponsors in their own legal systems and with the\r\ndemocratic principles that the Security Council\r\nencourages for the settlement of the conflicts under its\r\nconsideration. Frankly, we fail to see how a less\r\ndemocratic Security Council could more legitimately\r\nask more democracy of the rest of the world.\r\nThat is why, after having heard all the proposals\r\nmade in the last eight years, and taking account of\r\nexisting difficulties in, and the dynamics of, the present\r\ninternational situation, Argentina supports an increase\r\nin the category of non-permanent members only —\r\nelected members, that is. In our opinion, non-\r\npermanent members must continue to be elected\r\naccording to the criteria set out in Article 23,\r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter: their contribution to\r\ninternational peace and security, and the principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution. We think that it is\r\nfor the regional groups to decide on the allocation of\r\nthe new non-permanent seats created as a consequence\r\nof Council reform. This procedure has worked well in\r\nthe past and must be retained.\r\nWhatever reform takes place, it must be based on\r\ntransparency and democratic principles. The Security\r\nCouncil asks for greater democracy from the majority\r\nof countries on its agenda. Therefore, the Council\r\nshould start by applying this principle to itself and\r\nfight against the lack of democracy not only in its\r\ncomposition but also in its procedures.\r\nArgentina has a long tradition of supporting the\r\nreform of the working methods of the Council. In 1994,\r\ntogether with New Zealand, we promoted a process to\r\nformalize a consultation mechanism between the\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries. In February\r\n2000, on the basis of an Argentine initiative and during\r\nthe Argentine presidency, the Council adopted a note\r\nby the President of the Council (S/2000/155) that\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nformalized the Argentine proposal that newly elected\r\nCouncil members should be invited to observe the\r\nCouncil’s informal consultations for a period of one\r\nmonth immediately preceding their term of\r\nmembership.\r\nWe are not going to elaborate further now on the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. We had a\r\nchance to express our opinion on the issue a few days\r\nago, when we spoke on the report of the Security\r\nCouncil. But I would like to make the following points.\r\nAll of the delegations that participated in that\r\ndebate clearly indicated their dissatisfaction with the\r\nCouncil’s report. The Security Council cannot remain\r\nindifferent to this, lest it deepen its isolation from the\r\nrest of the membership. Curiously, none of the\r\npermanent members participated in that very\r\ninteresting debate. We want to reiterate that the report\r\nmust be substantive and analytical; it cannot be a\r\ncompendium of previously published documents. The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General may provide useful\r\nguidelines here.\r\nAt the same time, we want to state our\r\nsatisfaction at the fact that the Council has been\r\nadopting more transparent practices in recent times.\r\nStill, there is a long way to go. That is why we believe\r\nthat the start of informal contacts between the Security\r\nCouncil’s working group on documentation and\r\nprocedures and the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform will make a positive\r\ncontribution to improving the Council’s working\r\nmethods.\r\nThe events of 11 September reminded us all, in an\r\nextraordinarily cruel and painful manner, of how\r\nimportant it is for the international community to stand\r\nunited to meet decisively and effectively the new\r\nthreats to international peace and security that have\r\nemerged. The Security Council has an essential role to\r\nplay in this fight.\r\nTherefore, today more than ever, it is crucial to\r\nabandon extreme positions and archaic privileges,\r\nwhich are contrary to the progress of history and\r\ninternational relations. Together, we must find rational\r\nsolutions based on consensus. We need a Security\r\nCouncil more suited to the twenty-first century than to\r\nthe nineteenth. That is to say, we need a more\r\nrepresentative, transparent, accountable and democratic\r\nSecurity Council. Never the opposite.\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\nBelarus delegation would like to start by saying that\r\ndespite the difficulty of the task facing us, some\r\npositive efforts have been achieved in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the issue of equitable representation\r\non the Security Council, increasing its membership and\r\nother related matters.\r\nAlthough no impressive results were achieved, a\r\ntotal of 20 meetings over five sessions have allowed us\r\nto study and narrow differences on such issues as\r\nCouncil’s working methods, the transparency of its\r\nwork, decision-making within the Security Council,\r\nincluding the right of veto, and increasing the\r\nmembership of the Council. Also, in many ways, we\r\nhave been able to consolidate the views of States on\r\nthese issues. A useful innovation in our view was the\r\n13 June 2000 special meeting with Ambassador\r\nChowdhury of Bangladesh, at that time presiding over\r\nthe Security Council, and two other Council members,\r\nAmbassador Jeremy Greenstock of the United\r\nKingdom and Ambassador Alfonso Valdivieso of\r\nColombia, in which they told us of the kind of steps\r\nbeing taken in the Security Council to achieve more\r\nopenness and transparency in Council procedures. We\r\nfully agree with the view that such meetings of the\r\nWorking Group, in which members of the Council\r\nparticipate with an interactive exchange of views on\r\nissues with the members of the Group, should be\r\ncontinued in the future.\r\nWe also agree that the progress achieved by the\r\nCouncil in enhancing the transparency and\r\neffectiveness of its work should be further built upon.\r\nOur approach is that Council reforms should be based\r\nnot on temporary, transient processes and trends, but on\r\nthose reflecting stable new patterns that have emerged\r\nin the world of international politics.\r\nThe position of the Republic of Belarus on the\r\nissue of Security Council reform has already been\r\ndistributed as an official document at the General\r\nAssembly. It covers the three basic components of the\r\nprocess: number and make-up of Council membership,\r\ndecision-making processes and working methods. Of\r\ncourse, these are all organically linked, and we\r\nrecognize the importance of all aspects of this process,\r\nstarting with the Council’s working methods and\r\nmoving on through efforts to increase the membership\r\nprimarily by removing the imbalance in regional\r\nrepresentation and providing equitable geographical\r\ndistribution with respect to the regional groups.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nWe also agree that we need a gradual codification\r\nof the rules for use of the right of veto, necessarily\r\ntaking into account the Council’s powers under the\r\nCharter, including those powers granted under Chapter\r\nVII. It is also very important that we reach consensus\r\non this, taking into account the view of the five\r\npermanent members.\r\nWe are also glad to see a number of useful\r\nchanges in the Council’s methods of work such as a\r\ngeneral increase in the number of open meetings,\r\ninformational briefings and consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing countries, the practice of giving the floor\r\nto non-members of the Security Council in exploratory\r\ndiscussions, the system of interactive meetings with\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General, his special\r\nenvoys, or the Secretary-General himself, the ability to\r\nask questions in a question-and-answer format, the\r\nintroduction of the atmosphere of informal\r\nconsultations into open meetings that include non-\r\nmembers of the Council, and so forth.\r\nBelarus welcomes further measures allowing\r\ncountries that are not members of the Council to\r\nparticipate more actively in discussing the most\r\nimportant issues, both at the discussion stage and at the\r\ndecision-making stage, as well.\r\nFrom our point of view, it is important that we\r\nshould not limit the discussion of the most burning\r\nproblems to just Council members. We should discuss\r\nthem in a wider forum, open to all Member States, as\r\nhappened, for instance, when, here in this hall, we\r\ndiscussed measures to eliminate international terrorism\r\nand other such burning issues.\r\nWhen we take part in open meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council and put forward Belarus’s view on\r\nthese issues, we, like other Member States that actively\r\nput forward their own positions, try during the course\r\nof discussion, including the exploratory discussions,\r\nnot only to express our own vision of the reasons why\r\nproblems have arisen and how to tackle them. We are\r\nalso keen, wherever possible, to be a part of the\r\ncollective search for finding ways to resolve crisis\r\nsituations. We are happy when our position, our vision\r\nand our modest efforts to be useful are helpful in\r\ndecision-making.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus has always been in\r\nfavour of a stable system for international security. We\r\nhave always been an active advocate for achieving this\r\ngoal. As we see it, our main task is to maximize room\r\nfor cooperation and minimize room for rivalry. We\r\ncontinue to support the Working Group’s\r\nrecommendation in its current report to continue the\r\nwork and progress that has been achieved since the\r\nforty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that under your skilful guidance,\r\nMr. President, and based on your rich diplomatic\r\nexperience and qualities, the Working Group will\r\ncontinue to be active. We will continue in the future\r\nworking as hard as possible to make our contribution to\r\nthe joint effort to implement Security Council reform.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nMr. Kastrup (Germany): We are meeting once\r\nagain today to discuss the important issue of Security\r\nCouncil reform and to assess the work of the Open-\r\nended Working Group.\r\nI would like to begin by thanking Harri Holkeri,\r\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly, who, in his capacity as Chairman of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform, really displayed untiring efforts to achieve\r\nprogress in our common goal of making the Security\r\nCouncil more representative and equitable.\r\nWe welcome your desire, Mr. President, to be the\r\nnew Chairman of the Working Group, and we wish you\r\nall the best in your efforts to accelerate the reform\r\nprocess. We appreciate your intention, as you aptly put\r\nit, to move forward the discussions on Security Council\r\nreform, with the goal of having a more representative,\r\ntransparent and effective Security Council. We stand\r\nready to support you in this endeavour.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group has, in eight\r\nyears of deliberations, failed to achieve consensus on a\r\nsubstantial reform package. We have, however,\r\nwitnessed a few rather welcome changes in the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council that have\r\nresulted in somewhat enhanced transparency and\r\ncertain additional openness of the Council towards the\r\nlarger membership.\r\nFormal, public and private meetings have been\r\nheld more frequently. According to this year’s report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly, there\r\nwere 173 formal meetings, as compared to 185\r\nconsultations of the whole. Allowing non-members of\r\nthe Council to participate in the meetings, whenever\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\npossible, is an important factor in increasing\r\nacceptance of the Council’s work and decisions.\r\nThe presidency of the Security Council now\r\nbriefs, on a quite regular basis, non-members of the\r\nCouncil immediately after the Council’s deliberations.\r\nThese briefings, by now, have become a well-\r\nestablished practice. We encourage all future Council\r\npresidencies to continue in this fashion.\r\nFurthermore, as of August 2001, the Security\r\nCouncil has held several private meetings with troop-\r\ncontributing countries. These meetings, followed more\r\nrecently by a summarized report prepared by the\r\nSecurity Council presidency, constitute an important\r\nstep forward in implementing resolution 1353 (2001).\r\nWe strongly support this practice. We also know that\r\nthere is still room for improvement. Troop-contributing\r\ncountries are absolutely essential to any United Nations\r\npeacekeeping effort. It increases the credibility of\r\nSecurity Council decisions when they can meet\r\nofficially and on an equal footing with the members of\r\nthe Security Council, to have an open exchange of\r\nviews, voice their particular concerns and contribute\r\ntheir experience and proposals.\r\nSome of these positive developments in the\r\nworking methods of the Council came, in fact, in the\r\nwake of proposals we had made to achieve greater\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council. While we\r\nwelcome these developments, we would like to see\r\nfurther progress. Ad hoc missions of the Security\r\nCouncil to crisis regions are a case in point.\r\nSubsequent information for the general membership\r\nabout the findings of such missions, a written report\r\ncirculated as a United Nations document and a meeting\r\nto discuss the findings of the mission, with active\r\nparticipation of non-members in the Council’s\r\ndiscussion, would be a further step towards greater\r\ntransparency of the Council’s work.\r\nConcerning the central task of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group, I have to state that we are nowhere\r\nnear a solution to the ever-important issue of equitable\r\nrepresentation and increase in the Council’s\r\nmembership and of related matters such as the veto.\r\nI therefore reiterate our reform proposals that\r\ncome under the heading representation, accountability,\r\ndemocratization and transparency. We need a more\r\nrepresentative Council, and therefore an increase in the\r\nnumber of seats in both categories. We need a more\r\naccountable Council, and therefore a review process.\r\nWe need reform with regard to the veto to make the\r\nCouncil more democratic. Lastly, we need further\r\nreform of the working methods to make the Council\r\nmore transparent.\r\nWe welcome the initiative taken by Ambassador\r\nHolkeri, in his capacity as President of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, to ask Member States\r\nfor their assistance in exploring the best ways to\r\nimplement the Millennium Declaration’s mandate to\r\nreform the Security Council.\r\nEverybody should realize that the Millennium\r\nDeclaration reflects the political determination of the\r\nMember States to achieve a comprehensive reform of\r\nthe Security Council. In summarizing the replies\r\nreceived from Foreign Ministers, Ambassador Holkeri\r\npointed out that there is a common recognition that the\r\nCouncil needs to reflect the realities of the twenty-first\r\ncentury to better serve peace and security. We share\r\nAmbassador Holkeri’s assessment that presently the\r\ncrucial question is how to fulfil the Summit mandate\r\nand how to move forward, after eight years of\r\ndiscussions, to negotiations. The question is, how can\r\nwe move forward?\r\nHarri Holkeri highlighted several suggestions he\r\nreceived from Member States. The first suggestion was\r\nto move the discussion to a higher political level, a\r\nspecial session or a high-level meeting in order to\r\ngenerate sufficient political will to reach general\r\nagreement on reform. The second suggestion was to\r\nmaintain the overall goal of comprehensive Security\r\nCouncil reform while moving forward step by step, as\r\nin the context of General Assembly reform.\r\nWe believe that a step-by-step approach, while\r\nuseful with regard to a reform of the working methods\r\nof the Council, when applied to the representation on\r\nthe Council, may not lead to truly meaningful reform.\r\nIn our view, the next step could be the\r\ndevelopment of alternative reform models based on the\r\ndifferent positions expressed by Member States. We\r\nfind that annex XIII of the Working Group’s report\r\nprovides a very useful basis in this respect. By now, all\r\nproposals have been submitted.\r\nSummarizing and consolidating the various\r\nreform proposals might enable us to finally embark on\r\nmeaningful Security Council reform. We are ready at\r\nany time to elaborate and submit reform proposals, in\r\ncooperation with the President of the General\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nAssembly and the Chairman of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group, so that the Millennium Declaration’s\r\nobligations and intentions can be implemented.\r\nAs we all have learned painfully in recent weeks,\r\ntoday’s world holds greater threats to international\r\npeace and security than most of us would have\r\nacknowledged only a few weeks ago. The United\r\nNations is uniquely positioned to meet these\r\nchallenges. The challenges to international peace and\r\nsecurity naturally affect the significance of the work\r\nand the relevance of the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nBy adopting resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\r\n(2001), the Security Council acted swiftly and showed\r\nits determination to live up to its responsibility.\r\nIn the process, we have witnessed another new\r\ndevelopment in the work of the Council: the\r\nestablishment of the Committee on Counter-Terrorism,\r\nwhich, unlike previous Security Council committees, is\r\nnot a sanctions committee but one that relies on\r\ncooperation and assistance in the implementation of\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nThe Chairman of the newly established\r\nCommittee on Counter-Terrorism has repeatedly\r\nstressed that, in fulfilling the Committee’s mandate, he\r\nwill work in close cooperation with Member States. He\r\nstated that transparency and openness will be among\r\nthe key features of the Committee on Counter-\r\nTerrorism. We fully support this approach. It is the only\r\napproach that will be conducive to an effective\r\nimplementation of the Security Council’s recent\r\ndecision on terrorism. We should like to see\r\ntransparency and openness as the guiding principles of\r\nthe Council’s work in general.\r\nThe Security Council’s composition still reflects a\r\ntime when the international political order was quite\r\ndifferent from what it is today. Broader coalitions need\r\nto be built, and multilateral forums have to be\r\nstrengthened, which includes a reform of the United\r\nNations and its principal organs, not least of all the\r\nSecurity Council. Our proposals for reform remain on\r\nthe table, and we are more than willing to cooperate\r\nwith Member States in finding agreement on a reform\r\nthat reflects today’s realities and enables the United\r\nNations and its bodies to live up to its increased\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nWe have to translate the political will expressed\r\nin the Millennium Declaration into a constructive\r\napproach to Security Council reform. To conclude, I\r\nwould like to quote from the final address of the\r\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly, who stated on 10 September 2001 that “the\r\nUnited Nations cannot afford to fail in the reform of\r\nthe Security Council”. I could not agree more.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): Let me start by thanking\r\nthe President of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly, Harri Holkeri, together with Ambassador de\r\nSaram of Sri Lanka and Ambassador Ingólfsson of\r\nIceland for their invaluable efforts in leading our\r\ndiscussions on this item during the past year.\r\nI want to pledge our full cooperation, through\r\nyou, Sir, to the President of this Assembly, as he\r\nassumes, among so many other important\r\nresponsibilities, that of guiding us in carrying out this\r\ntask.\r\nIt is extremely important that the Security\r\nCouncil be perceived as a body that enjoys\r\nunquestionable legitimacy and authority. In fact, this is\r\nthe common ground and the main thrust behind our\r\nendeavours to reform the Security Council.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly has begun\r\nat a time of unprecedented challenge to the\r\nOrganization. In critical times such as these, the United\r\nNations, especially the Security Council, is called upon\r\nto fully exercise its responsibilities. The new security\r\nthreats faced by the international community highlight\r\nonce again the fact that the world today is quite\r\ndifferent from that of 56 years ago. And this makes\r\neven more eloquent the case for a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council so as to make it more\r\nrepresentative, effective and legitimate.\r\nThe Security Council must be made more\r\naccountable to the general membership, its methods of\r\nwork must provide for greater transparency and\r\nparticipation, and its composition must be adapted so\r\nas to better reflect present political realities and the\r\nenhanced role of developing countries in world affairs.\r\nAny meaningful reform package must, therefore,\r\nnecessarily include the enlargement of the Council’s\r\nmembership and improvement of its methods of work.\r\nOur positions are well known on this matter.\r\nBriefly stated, Brazil favours an enlargement in the\r\nnumber of both permanent and non-permanent\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nmembers of the Security Council, increasing the total\r\nnumber of members to the mid-twenties. We believe\r\nthat equitable representation in the Council can be\r\nachieved only if new permanent seats are allocated to\r\nboth developed and developing countries.\r\nA curtailment of the veto with a view to its\r\ngradual elimination is necessary. As a first step, the\r\nveto should be strictly limited to matters covered by\r\nChapter VII of the Charter. We also continue to believe\r\nthat equitable representation in the Security Council\r\nrequires that there should be no distinction between\r\nnew permanent members and the current ones. These\r\nare Brazil’s views on cluster I issues.\r\nOn cluster II issues, we commend the increasing\r\ntendency of the Security Council to be more\r\ntransparent and inclusive in its procedures. Private\r\nmeetings, open briefings, public debates and the\r\npractice of daily briefings help bring the work of the\r\nCouncil closer to the general membership. We welcome\r\nthe practice of public wrap-up sessions and believe that\r\nthey should serve as an opportunity, particularly for the\r\noutgoing President of the Council, to make a personal\r\nassessment of the work accomplished.\r\nNotwithstanding these positive developments,\r\ntwo issues continue to elude consensus with respect to\r\nthe Council’s working methods. The first issue relates\r\nto the need for the Council to conduct a greater amount\r\nof its actual business in open sessions. The Council\r\ncontinues to conduct most of its business in closed\r\ninformal consultations. We all recognize that “in\r\ncamera” meetings are necessary and useful. Very often,\r\nhowever, actual decisions are taken during informal\r\nconsultations of the whole. In these cases, informal\r\nconsultations cannot be treated as “non-existent”\r\nsessions of the Council, totally veiled or locked away\r\nfrom the general membership.\r\nWe believe that informal consultations should be\r\nformally treated as closed private meetings of the\r\nCouncil. Otherwise, they should be somehow\r\ninstitutionalized in order to ensure that appropriate\r\nrecords of the decisions are kept and that the provisions\r\nof Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter are not\r\ncircumvented in the work of the Council, thus allowing\r\nfor appropriate access and participation by affected\r\nStates.\r\nThe second issue that eludes consensus relates to\r\nthe need to improve the way the Security Council\r\ninteracts with the General Assembly and other main\r\nbodies of the Organization. The recent debate on the\r\nreport of the Security Council was illuminating in this\r\nrespect. For the sake of brevity, I will not repeat here\r\nthe comments and suggestions my delegation made\r\nwith respect to the format and content of the report. Let\r\nme, nevertheless, stress the point that interaction\r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly should\r\nbe more fluid and not confined to a one-day debate of\r\nthe annual report.\r\nWe see, for instance, that there is fertile ground\r\nfor the Council to produce focused, analytical special\r\nreports on a variety of issues, such as the protection of\r\ncivilians, peace-building, cooperation with troop-\r\ncontributing countries, difficulties encountered in the\r\nimplementation of sanction regimes and efforts to\r\ncombat international terrorism. We also believe that\r\nthere should be greater financial accountability of the\r\nSecurity Council in the sense that the wider\r\nmembership is entitled to receive more information,\r\nand in a more timely manner, on the budgetary\r\nimplications of decisions taken by the Council.\r\nThe Millennium Summit made an urgent call for\r\nrenewed efforts to achieve comprehensive reform of\r\nthe Security Council in all its aspects. The previous\r\nPresident of the General Assembly took the timely\r\ninitiative of consulting with the Foreign Ministers of\r\nall Members States on practical means to move this\r\nprocess forward and meet the mandate of the\r\nMillennium Summit. We share his assessment that\r\nwhile some progress has been made in the working\r\nmethods of the Council, the main issues remain open.\r\nAfter eight years of continuous discussions, we\r\nshare a deep sense of frustration with the slow pace of\r\nprogress achieved in the activities of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. As we approach this challenge again,\r\nwe cannot afford to engage in yet another round of\r\ngeneral discussions. The issues have already been\r\nidentified. They have been fully discussed, and we\r\nknow where the difficulties lie.\r\nIn resolution 53/30, the General Assembly\r\nrightfully set a very high standard for decisions\r\npertaining to the reform of the Security Council. We\r\nmust now start preparing the ground for the political\r\ndecisions involved, and it is inevitable that at a certain\r\npoint we will need to test which proposals and ideas\r\ncan meet the requirement set by the General Assembly.\r\nIn this respect, we remain convinced that our\r\ndiscussions over the past eight years have shown that\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nthere is a substantial body of support for the expansion\r\nof the Security Council in both categories of members,\r\nfor the assignment of new permanent seats to both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries and for a\r\nmovement towards gradual elimination of the veto.\r\nIn his remarks to the concluding session of the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, President\r\nHolkeri summarized the replies received from our\r\nForeign Ministers on possible avenues to advance this\r\nprocess. One of the suggestions picked up by\r\nMr. Holkeri was that Governments may want to\r\napproach this shared goal by moving step by step. We\r\nbelieve that this is exactly what we were doing when\r\nwe decided, for instance, on the issue of the majority\r\nrequired for decisions relating to the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. The next logical step would be to\r\nreach agreement on the size of a reformed Council and\r\nbuild blocks from there so that a comprehensive\r\npackage of reform can be designed in the foreseeable\r\nfuture.\r\nBrazil, for its part, remains committed to continue\r\nto work constructively with all delegations in the\r\nsearch for a resolution of these outstanding issues. We\r\nare confident, Mr. President, that your leadership and\r\nkeen sense of diplomacy will enable us to move ahead\r\nin this common goal of all Member States. You may be\r\nassured of our full cooperation.\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino): First of all, I wish to\r\nassociate myself with the previous speakers in thanking\r\nPresident Holkeri and the two co-chairmen of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group, Ambassadors Ingólfsson\r\nand de Saram, for the excellent work done this past\r\nyear. I am certain that the next cycle of negotiations\r\nunder the skilled leadership of the current President\r\nwill be extremely fruitful.\r\nI will try to be brief and pragmatic, without\r\nreiterating positions already expressed before. In some\r\nprevious statements, we heard complaints by certain\r\ndelegations about the fact that the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup has not yet obtained results, notwithstanding its\r\neight years of intense activity. There is here an implicit\r\ncomplaint, which, in my view, is directed at a group of\r\ncountries whose only fault is to oppose the modalities\r\nand terms of a reform of the Security Council proposed\r\nand sought by another group of countries. In other\r\nwords, we have not obtained results, simply because to\r\nadopt now a decision on the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council would be premature and hasty. The\r\nlack of results in the reforms of the Security Council\r\ncannot be attributed only to one group of countries.\r\nRather, we share a common responsibility for it.\r\nThe position of my country is well known: we\r\nfavour the increase of non-permanent seats only. The\r\nextension of the privileges of the permanent members\r\nto other countries would mean to create additional\r\ninjustice and further discrimination. Moreover, it would\r\nlimit the General Assembly’s power to elect the\r\ncandidates of its choice on the basis of the contribution\r\nof each country to the work of the Organization. This\r\nlimitation on the powers of the General Assembly\r\nbecomes even more significant if we consider that 81\r\ncountries — a little less than half of the membership of\r\nthe United Nations — have never been members of the\r\nSecurity Council, and the only contribution they can\r\nmake to its work is by democratically electing their\r\nrepresentatives to that organ.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that, for the time\r\nbeing, the only enlargement possible is in the non-\r\npermanent category. Insisting on blocking this kind of\r\nenlargement goes against the interests of many\r\ncountries, which belong to all geographical areas and\r\ncould have had the opportunity during the past eight\r\nyears to participate actively as non-permanent members\r\nin an enlarged Security Council.\r\nIf the debate in the Working Group were to be re-\r\nopened on the question of the increase in the permanent\r\nmembers category, San Marino believes that the core of\r\nthe enlargement lies in the question of the veto — its\r\nextension to the new permanent members, its limitation\r\nin the sphere of application and its possible\r\ncurtailment. We will also have to face the question of\r\nthe proportion between the rights and duties of the\r\npossible new permanent members, and go back to the\r\nquestion of the criteria to be applied to select them.\r\nThe definition of those points is crucial for an equitable\r\nand democratic reform.\r\nAnyhow, as it has already been stated by other\r\ndelegations, these past eight years have not been\r\nsterile. We can clearly detect improvements brought\r\nabout in the methods of work and in the procedures of\r\nthe Security Council — improvements that we must\r\nsurely attribute to the activities of the Working Group.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino will continue to\r\nfollow this subject with extreme interest and will take\r\nactive part in the future debate in the Working Group,\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nbecause the Group is, and must continue to be, the only\r\nforum for discussion of this important issue.\r\nMr. Estévez-López (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): In ordinary times, our debate on Security\r\nCouncil reform is, to paraphrase the great Colombian\r\nwriter, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a chronicle of a\r\nforetold debate. All those who have followed the\r\ncourse of our discussions on this topic, which now\r\nappears for the eighth time on our annual agenda,\r\nknow, beforehand, what everyone else will have to say\r\non the matter. And we will once more ascertain that the\r\ndifferences between us are so daunting that they simply\r\nparalyse any action. For that reason, almost all astute\r\nobservers of our Organization predict that the reform of\r\nthe Security Council is an undertaking that will take\r\nyears, if not decades. And, up to now, those observers\r\nhave been right. Given the reluctance of some States to\r\nalter the status quo — because of the privileges it\r\nprovides them — and the enormous task of bridging so\r\nmany opposing positions, inertia prevails and nothing\r\nhappens.\r\nHowever, these are not ordinary times. The events\r\nof 11 September not only shook our collective\r\nconscience and dignity, but represented a challenge to\r\nthe United Nations. In some respects, the Organization\r\nhas risen to the occasion. I am not referring so much to\r\nthe swiftness with which both the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly reacted, within 24 hours, with\r\ntheir respective resolutions — although that, too, is\r\nnoteworthy. More important, to my mind, is the fact\r\nthat those events were followed by responses\r\ncompatible with multilateral arrangements and the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, instead of by unilateral\r\nresponses bypassing the United Nations. This is\r\nanother way of saying that, at least at the outset,\r\nmultilateralism prevailed over unilateralism and we\r\nbelieve that this, in principle, is a positive result.\r\nAt another level, however, those events laid bare\r\nthe main shortcomings of our system of governance,\r\nespecially regarding the links between the United\r\nNations main organs and the proper role each has to\r\nplay. In this respect, it will be recalled that, when we\r\nexamined the report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly only two weeks ago, we heard the\r\nlamentations of many delegations regarding the\r\nenormous gulf that divides the main organs of the\r\nUnited Nations. It would appear that the Security\r\nCouncil feels no need to offer accountability to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, even in its most formal expression.\r\nAt the same time, however, the Security Council\r\nadopted a far-reaching resolution — I am referring, of\r\ncourse, to resolution 1373 (2001) — which contains\r\ncommitments that are binding on all Member States.\r\nHow are we to reconcile these two facts? How can we\r\nensure that the wider membership will comply with\r\nthat resolution by conviction, rather than by\r\nimposition? In other words, how can we endow the\r\nactions of the Security Council with greater legitimacy\r\nat the moment when such far-reaching decisions are\r\nadopted?\r\nWe know the generic answers to these questions.\r\nWe need a more representative Council that reflects\r\ntoday’s world, rather than that of 1945; a Council\r\nwhich acts with greater transparency; and a Council\r\nwith greater accountability, willing at the very least to\r\ninform the wider membership on whose behalf it acts.\r\nAfter 11 September, however, those concepts have\r\nacquired a whole new meaning. They have become\r\nimperatives for the good governance of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThere are two types of decisions that can be taken\r\nto move in that direction. First, more avenues of\r\ncommunication must be built between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. The same can be\r\nsaid regarding the Economic and Social Council. In\r\nfact, the process of consultations begun by the\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom, in\r\nhis capacity as Chairman of the Committee created by\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), is a positive step. It opens a\r\ntwo-way channel of communication between both\r\norgans, which is an eminently healthy development.\r\nMuch more needs to be done, however.\r\nSecondly, we must abandon the culture that has\r\ntaken root in the Organization, which holds that reform\r\nof the Security Council is such a daunting task that it is\r\nbest not even to try it. We, on the other hand, believe in\r\nthe old axiom that “where there is a will, there is a\r\nway”. The first to abandon this culture must be the\r\npermanent members themselves, since they are the\r\nones that should be the most interested in ensuring that\r\ndecisions of the Security Council are well received by\r\nthe wider membership.\r\nThis is not the place to expound on concrete\r\nproposals on the various parameters that make up our\r\nage-old debate on this matter. It is clear, however, that\r\nthe decision-making process of the Council must\r\nreflect reality. This will lead to some type of weighted\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nvoting that, whether we like it or not, will probably\r\ninclude endowing the most influential countries with\r\nthe ability to impede decisions with which they\r\ndisagree. It is equally clear, however, that, due to the\r\nforce of circumstances, the time has come to revisit the\r\ncomposition of the Council in order to provide it with\r\ngreater representativeness, transparency and\r\naccountability.\r\nLet us therefore abandon our dialogue of the deaf\r\nand the mute and make an effort to address Security\r\nCouncil reform in the serious and committed manner\r\nthat present circumstances warrant and as our heads of\r\nState instructed us to do in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nIt is true that it will be difficult, but by no means\r\nimpossible. Let us then do it. The future of the United\r\nNations depends upon it.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I would like to\r\nexpress our appreciation for the constructive\r\ncontribution to the Security Council reform issues\r\nmade by Mr. Han’s predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of\r\nFinland, as the Chairman of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup, and by his two Vice-Chairmen, Ambassadors\r\nIngólfsson of Iceland and de Saram of Sri Lanka, for\r\ntheir excellent work and guidance in the Working\r\nGroup this past session. I would also like to extend our\r\ngratitude to them for the preparation of the report of\r\nthe Working Group.\r\nUkraine strongly believes that reform of the\r\nSecurity Council remains one of the most fundamental\r\nand urgent issues on the United Nations agenda. In the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment reaffirmed their commitment to spare no\r\neffort in making the United Nations a more effective\r\ninstrument for pursuing a prosperous, just and peaceful\r\nworld. In this regard, they stressed in particular the\r\nresolve to intensify their efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that the\r\nCouncil, as the main United Nations body entrusted\r\nwith the indispensable responsibility of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, should bring to its\r\nwork new capacities and new perspectives to meet the\r\nchallenges of the new century. At the same time,\r\nUkraine shares the disappointment over the little\r\nprogress that has been achieved with regard to the\r\nreform, despite the continuous and strenuous efforts of\r\nthe majority of Member States. Though some\r\nprovisional agreements were recorded at the last\r\nsession on a number of issues dealing specifically with\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council, it is\r\nregrettable that the Group was unable to reach an\r\nagreement on substantive issues of the Council’s\r\nreform.\r\nThis reveals the difficulty of our task and the\r\nsignificance of the interests involved. However, we\r\nshould not be discouraged by this fact. Let us not\r\nforget that it took quite a while to accomplish the 1965\r\nreform, which in fact created the present structure of\r\nthe Council. The General Assembly’s mandate to the\r\nWorking Group is clear: to seek general agreement that\r\ngrants legitimacy and credibility to the exercise of\r\nreform. Therefore, we believe that the current\r\nstalemate in the Working Group could be overcome if a\r\ngreater degree of flexibility were shown by all parties.\r\nWhat is really unacceptable to my delegation and, I\r\nbelieve, to the majority of States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations is preserving the status quo in this\r\nissue. It is our sincere hope that, next year, the Group\r\nwill pursue these goals with greater determination and\r\nwill demonstrate a result-oriented approach.\r\nI should like very briefly to reiterate the position\r\nof Ukraine on some key elements in this regard. First\r\nand foremost, the reform should be based on strict\r\ncompliance with the norms and principles of the\r\nCharter. Ukraine believes that the enlarged Security\r\nCouncil should comprise between 24 and 26 seats.\r\nBoth categories of membership — permanent and non-\r\npermanent — should be expanded. My country has\r\nrepeatedly emphasized that those countries which are\r\nable and willing to take greater responsibility —\r\nincluding financial responsibility — in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, and which enjoy the\r\nnecessary authority and support at both regional and\r\nglobal levels, should be able to receive the status of\r\npermanent members.\r\nIn this context, we recognize the willingness of\r\nGermany and Japan to assume the responsibilities of\r\npermanent members. Accordingly, the Council’s\r\nenlargement, through the addition of new seats in both\r\ncategories for developing countries from Africa, Asia\r\nand Latin America and the Caribbean, would better\r\nreflect the changed international political and economic\r\nlandscape. At the same time, the expansion of the\r\ncategory of non-permanent membership must\r\nnecessarily include an additional seat for the Eastern\r\nEuropean Group, the membership of which has more\r\nthan doubled during the last decade.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nThe veto remains at the heart of the problem of\r\nCouncil reform and is clearly one of the most\r\ncontroversial issues we have to deal with. Ukraine\r\nstrongly believes that, given present political realities,\r\nthe institution of the veto, at least in its present form, is\r\nobsolete and unjustified. Ukraine is convinced that the\r\nexistence of the veto right is one of the major reasons\r\nwhy the Council finds itself frequently prevented from\r\ndischarging its primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\r\nwould therefore like to join all those delegations that\r\nhave called for the curtailment of the scope and\r\napplication of the veto, with a view to its subsequent\r\nelimination.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that considerable\r\nprogress was made in the area of the working methods\r\nof the Council — for example, in holding meetings in a\r\npublic format and in enhancing transparency — as has\r\nalready been underlined by a number of delegations.\r\nWe also welcome the increase in the number of public\r\ndebates and private meetings of the Council, which\r\nprovide a real opportunity for non-members to make\r\nuseful contributions. We also would like to note the\r\nincreased interaction between the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup and the Council itself. The very fact that these\r\nand other improvements in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil are being gradually introduced into its\r\npractices, before they are institutionalized by the\r\nWorking Group, proves that deliberations within the\r\nGroup could be effectively supplemented by the\r\ninnovative and proactive approach of members of the\r\nCouncil. We should continue our efforts to ensure that\r\nthis practice can become a rule rather than an\r\nexception.\r\nFinally, we are fully confident that under the\r\nskilful guidance of the President of the General\r\nAssembly the Working Group will continue to seek\r\nways to advance our work on Council reform. We\r\nbelieve that the President will bring further dynamism\r\nto its activities, and in that undertaking he can count on\r\nmy delegation’s full support and cooperation.\r\nMs. Rasi (Finland): I have the honour to speak on\r\nbehalf of the Nordic countries — Denmark, Iceland,\r\nNorway, Sweden and my own country, Finland.\r\nThe terrorist attacks on 11 September have\r\nprofoundly affected our sense of security, both as\r\nMember States and as individuals. They were a brutal\r\nintrusion into our open, democratic, tolerant and\r\nmulticultural societies. Fear and insecurity were\r\nglobalized overnight. The Security Council, as the\r\nbody primarily responsible for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, demonstrated resolve\r\nand unity in the aftermath of the attacks. In a unique\r\nmanner, the United Nations quickly brought about the\r\nwidest possible coalition to fight against terrorism.\r\nHopefully, this sense of unity will also help us to create\r\na new era of cooperation between Member States in\r\nother fields, too, including United Nations reforms.\r\nThe Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to the United\r\nNations and its Secretary-General, gives the\r\nOrganization the recognition it deserves for its efforts\r\nto create a safer and better world. At the same time, it\r\nraises expectations for an even more effective United\r\nNations, not least with regard to the Security Council.\r\nIn order for the Council to maintain its role and\r\nauthority, and for its decisions to carry the necessary\r\nweight, it must better reflect the world of today.\r\nHopefully, the Nobel Peace Prize will give new\r\nimpetus to the resolve of the heads of State or\r\nGovernment, expressed in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nto intensify efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council in all its aspects.\r\nIt has proved difficult to reach a consensus\r\namong the Member States on how to move forward. It\r\nis, however, widely recognized that enlargement is\r\nnecessary in order to ensure better geographical\r\nrepresentation in the Council and to strengthen the role\r\nof the developing countries. At the same time, it is\r\nessential to avoid reducing the efficiency of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nDiscussions on both the enlargement and the\r\ndecision-making of the Security Council must continue\r\nwith more vigour and determination so as to break the\r\ncurrent impasse. We need to keep an open mind with\r\nregard to proposals that could contribute to making\r\nprogress, focusing on a number of crucial issues with\r\nthe aim of gaining the support of the broadest possible\r\nmajority of the United Nations membership.\r\nThe veto remains a crucial issue in the\r\nfunctioning and decision-making of the Security\r\nCouncil. The practice of trying to achieve texts and\r\nresolutions that permit permanent members to abstain,\r\nrather than exercise their veto, represents a step in the\r\nright direction. This is an inclusive approach that\r\ndemonstrates the seriousness with which that body\r\ndeals with today’s challenges, thereby contributing to\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nrespect and support for the Security Council and its\r\ndecisions. A difference of opinion can thereby be\r\nexpressed without blocking the Security Council from\r\ntaking necessary action.\r\nChanges to the right of veto can be made on the\r\nbasis of a common understanding among Member\r\nStates without amendments to the Charter. The present\r\npermanent members would still have unique\r\nresponsibility for the activities and decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council. More political will is needed for this\r\nto take place, and we welcome the active participation\r\nof the permanent members and their engagement in\r\nopen and results-oriented discussions. The permanent\r\nmembers should limit the use of the veto. If the veto is\r\nnevertheless used, its use should be explained.\r\nWhile enlargement remains the most crucial\r\nissue, matters related to transparency and openness\r\nshould not be forgotten. Improvements in those fields\r\nwould benefit all Member States with immediate effect,\r\neven if enlargement has eluded us for such a long time.\r\nThe Nordic countries acknowledge the progress\r\nmade on improving the working methods of the\r\nCouncil. While we welcome the tendency towards\r\nmore openness and regular consultations with non-\r\nmembers of the Council, in particular with troop-\r\ncontributing countries, there is, however, further scope\r\nfor improvements in this area.\r\nWith the able guidance of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we hope that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group can make progress on reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. We must be able to show that the\r\ncommitments made by our heads of State or\r\nGovernment can be fulfilled and that the United\r\nNations is an organization that can renew itself and\r\nrespond to the current challenges.\r\nMr. Ordzhonikidze (Russian Federation) (spoke\r\nin Russian): The terrorist acts of 11 September\r\npresented the United Nations and its Security Council\r\nwith tasks of unprecedented scale in the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security. In the present\r\nsituation, the Security Council’s ability to respond\r\nquickly and appropriately to new challenges to global\r\npeace is more important than ever. Under these\r\ncircumstances, reform of the Security Council as an\r\nintegral part of the broad process of United Nations\r\nrenewal should ensure not only the preservation but\r\nalso the strengthening of the Council’s ability\r\neffectively to exercise its powers under the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nReform of that principal organ of the United\r\nNations is entirely in the hands of the States Members of\r\nthe Organization, which all have a stake in its success. In\r\nmany respects, resolving this issue is crucial to the\r\nfuture role of the United Nations in world affairs and to\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council as\r\nthe body with primary Charter responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. That is\r\nwhy Russia has consistently favoured achieving the\r\nbroadest possible agreement — or preferably\r\nconsensus — on a possible formula for the enlargement\r\nof the Council. We hope that this approach is supported\r\nby an overwhelming majority of Member States.\r\nIn our view, the stated intention of participants in\r\nthe Millennium Summit to intensify the process of\r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform is in tune with\r\nthat policy position. We advocate continuing the\r\npainstaking work aimed at bridging the significant\r\ndifferences that still exist among States, first of all on\r\nthe key issue of the future composition of the Council.\r\nRussia’s position on the substance of the issue of\r\nSecurity Council reform is well known. As always, we\r\nremain open to constructive proposals concerning the\r\ncategories of membership within which the Council\r\nshould be enlarged.\r\nThe Council’s existing decision-making\r\nprocedure ensures an appropriate balance of the\r\ninterests of its members and contributes to reaching\r\nconsensus on issues under consideration; this is\r\nessential if the Council’s work is to be effective. We\r\ncontinue to hold the firm and principled position that\r\nthere should be no derogation from the prerogatives\r\nand powers of the current permanent members of the\r\nCouncil, including their right of veto. Unjustified\r\ncriticism of the institution of the veto stirs up\r\nunnecessary emotions and in no way facilitates the\r\nachievement of desired agreement on the parameters of\r\nreform.\r\nIt is important to keep the Security Council as\r\ncompact as possible to ensure needed efficiency and\r\nviability. We believe that priority should be given to\r\ndetermining the optimal makeup of the Council rather\r\nthan to considering the quantitative aspects of its\r\nenlargement. We have repeatedly stressed that\r\nenlargement must embrace both developed and\r\ndeveloping States. That is important if we are to ensure\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nthat the Council’s membership is balanced. Here, we\r\nconsider India, for example, a strong and worthy\r\ncandidate for permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil should it be decided to enlarge the Council in\r\nboth categories. There are strong candidates in other\r\nregions as well.\r\nI assure the Assembly that Russia will continue to\r\nparticipate constructively in the search for effective\r\nand broadly supported ways to reform the Security\r\nCouncil. We look forward to the broadest possible\r\ncooperation on this issue. Russia will continue to work\r\nactively in the Assembly’s Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters related to the Security Council,\r\nwhich we believe should remain the main United\r\nNations forum on the subject. As always, the activities\r\nof the Group should be based upon agreed parameters,\r\nincluding the principle of consensus and the so-called\r\npackage approach.\r\nSecurity Council reform will be successful only if\r\nit results not in disagreement but in a greater rallying\r\nof States around that unique organ, which, on behalf of\r\nall States Members of the United Nations, bears\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of peace on\r\nEarth.\r\nMr. Khalid (Pakistan): I take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. We are confident that with his able guidance\r\nand diplomatic skills he will steer the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to a successful conclusion. We also\r\nappreciate the dedication and commitment of the\r\nprevious President, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, in\r\nchairing the meetings of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as the contribution made to that\r\nprocess by the representatives of Iceland and of Sri\r\nLanka.\r\nWe have entered the ninth year since we started\r\nthe debate on the item before us. Clearly, that is a long\r\nperiod of deliberations. Some might feel fatigued\r\nbecause of the time that has elapsed, but in view of the\r\nvast differences on the issue it is imperative that the\r\nmatter not be dealt with in a hasty manner. Every one\r\nof us is aware that the question of Security Council\r\nreform encompasses issues that are both complex and\r\nof direct relevance to the sovereign equality of Member\r\nStates. At stake are issues which cover all aspects of\r\nthe Security Council, including its enlargement,\r\ndecision-making, the question of the veto and the\r\nCouncil’s working methods. There has been a general\r\nagreement among Member States that these issues are\r\nnot only vital for the interests of Member States but\r\nalso interlinked. Therefore, there is a need to handle\r\nthese issues with great care, taking into account the\r\nobjective realities and general interests of Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group established by\r\nthe General Assembly has discussed all these issues in\r\nconsiderable detail. However, deep differences on them\r\nremain among the membership. A minority feels that\r\nsimply according permanent status to a few Member\r\nStates will be a panacea. On the other hand, the\r\noverwhelming majority rightly believes that Security\r\nCouncil reform must take into account the principle of\r\nsovereign equality of States and geographical\r\ndistribution enabling the widest possible participation\r\nof Member States of the United Nations. We are thus\r\nfaced with a situation in which a minority is trying to\r\ndictate the agenda on these issues with prime focus on\r\nits narrow interests.\r\nThere is another small group of new aspirants for\r\nthe permanent membership that, in order to enhance\r\ntheir individual prestige, want to convince the world\r\nthat their size or economic or industrial power qualifies\r\nthem to acquire permanent membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. In our view, the general membership’s trust\r\nand confidence in the Security Council can be\r\nreinforced only by strengthening its democratic,\r\naccountable and participatory character, not by creating\r\nnew centres of power. We cannot grant a distinctive,\r\ndifferent and elevated position to some over the others.\r\nEquity and representativity cannot be served by the\r\ncreation of new centres of power and privilege.\r\nThe pretenders have employed a variety of\r\narguments to justify their claim to exalted status on the\r\nCouncil. However, the real motive is their desire to join\r\nthe present oligarchy, which is an anachronistic\r\nremnant of the Second World War. We would like to\r\nask what holy purpose an increase in the number of\r\npermanent seats would serve. How are new permanent\r\nmembers going to contribute to the peace, security and\r\ndevelopment of the world? How are they going to\r\npromote the right of self-determination of oppressed\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\npeople, protect human rights or eradicate poverty?\r\nThese are fundamental questions. The addition of more\r\npermanent members would make the Council neither\r\nmore democratic, more representative, more\r\ntransparent or more efficient. It would make it more\r\nundemocratic, unrepresentative and unresponsive to the\r\nconcerns of the vast majority.\r\nWe have also been listening to the amazing\r\nargument which revolves around the economic or\r\nindustrial prowess of some nations and their\r\ncontribution to the United Nations as credentials for\r\ntheir candidature for that Hall of Fame. If industrial\r\ndevelopment is a criterion, how has it helped the world,\r\nespecially the developing and least developed\r\ncountries, to eradicate their poverty or solve their debt\r\nproblems? Indeed, if contribution is the criterion, then\r\nmost of the developing countries would be left with no\r\nrole in the United Nations.\r\nWhile there is absolutely no consensus on\r\nexpanding the permanent category, there is a genuine\r\ndemand for increasing the number of non-permanent\r\nseats in the Security Council. This demand does not\r\narise out of an urge to buttress narrow interests or to\r\ngain super-Power or regional Power status; it arises out\r\nof simple statistics regarding the growth in the number\r\nof independent States since the mid-sixties. This\r\ndemand would not hamper the work of the Security\r\nCouncil or snatch away the privileges of the few; it is\r\nderived from the fact that the present membership in\r\nthe non-permanent category is too small to\r\naccommodate the number of candidatures presented for\r\neach term. On average, a Member State has to wait\r\nbetween 10 and 15 years to announce its candidature\r\nfor Security Council membership. With the addition of\r\nnew non-permanent seats, we would be encouraging\r\nthe active participation of the vast majority of the\r\nUnited Nations membership, which comprises medium-\r\nsized and small States.\r\nIt is also the wish of the vast majority of Member\r\nStates that the veto should be eliminated or, at the very\r\nleast, that its use should be restricted to decisions under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter. Let us analyse a bit what\r\nthe veto has done to nations. In the heat of the cold\r\nwar, this instrument of power was utilized on a partisan\r\nbasis. It fed the power blocs. It was never intended to\r\ndispense justice to Member States. As a result, issues\r\nwhich are as old as the United Nations itself are still\r\npending in the Security Council. Glaring examples of\r\nselective application of the veto power are the issues of\r\nPalestine and Kashmir. The veto power, instead of\r\nbecoming an instrument of confidence and security for\r\nMember States, has in fact become a tool of\r\nintimidation and coercion. In the twenty-first century,\r\nwith lofty slogans of globalization, promotion of peace,\r\nhuman rights, democracy, equality and justice, no\r\njustification remains for the veto to stay in the statutes\r\nof the United Nations. The issue of the veto, in our\r\nview, is intrinsically linked to the reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council. Any attempt to\r\nseparate the issue of the veto from enlargement would\r\nbe self-serving. The veto forms an important element\r\nof the overall reform package, which should be carried\r\nout in all its aspects and in a comprehensive and\r\ninclusive manner, as mandated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration last year.\r\nWe have seen some positive trends in the area of\r\nworking methods under cluster II issues. The Security\r\nCouncil has moved in the direction of adopting a\r\nmechanism for greater consultation and coordination\r\nbetween the Council members and troop-contributing\r\ncountries. We welcome this move, but we feel that the\r\nSecurity Council has to do much more to\r\ninstitutionalize the triangular cooperation between\r\nitself, the Secretariat and the troop contributors to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. We welcome the initiative to\r\ninvite the Security Council members to brief the Open-\r\nended Working Group on cluster II issues and hope that\r\nthis interrelationship will be further strengthened.\r\nAnother recent innovation in Council meetings is\r\nopen thematic debates. As we understand it, this\r\npractice was introduced to enable Member States to\r\nexpress their views on any given theme or issue, which\r\nthen would be taken into account by the Security\r\nCouncil at the time of its decision-making. In reality,\r\nmembers of the Council generally finalize a draft\r\nresolution or presidential statement in advance of an\r\nopen meeting. The script is already agreed upon, only\r\nto be subsequently enacted. Such debates are therefore\r\nreduced to sterile exercises, as in a debating club.\r\nClosed-door or informal consultations remain the\r\nrule rather than the exception for Security Council\r\nmeetings. Open or public meetings take place only\r\nafter agreements are reached behind closed doors. In\r\nthis process, we have witnessed the “invisible” use of\r\nthe veto time and again. The practice of informal\r\nconsultations runs contrary to the requirements of\r\ntransparency and accountability.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nFor us, the Security Council is an important and\r\nprestigious organ of the United Nations system. This\r\ninstitution can maintain its prestige only if its reform\r\nprocess is carried out in a transparent and open manner.\r\nWe are deeply concerned at the attempts by some to\r\ncast doubt on the efficacy of the way in which the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group is carrying out its\r\nmandate. We believe that the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup is the only appropriate forum to continue with\r\nthis exercise and come out with a viable solution, as\r\nmandated by the General Assembly.\r\nWe have entered an age where the words “power”\r\nand “prestige” have become anachronistic. We all must\r\nwork together to ameliorate the plight of humanity,\r\nwhich needs peace, security and equal opportunity for\r\ndevelopment. Let us not do anything which would\r\nharm the interests of the international community or\r\ncause disillusionment among nations that hold the\r\nUnited Nations in the highest esteem, even revere it.\r\nRather, we should strengthen their sense of belonging\r\nto the United Nations system, at this critical juncture of\r\nworld history, when we all are combining our efforts in\r\nthe pursuit of our shared objective to combat and\r\neradicate terrorism.\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Barely\r\ntwo weeks ago, during our consideration of the\r\nSecurity Council’s annual report to the General\r\nAssembly, 54 delegations — including mine —\r\nreiterated yet again the urgent need to expedite the\r\nprocess of Council reform. All 54 speakers highlighted\r\nthe increasing demands on the Security Council,\r\nbecause that is the body to which the world turns when\r\nit requires meaningful answers.\r\nHowever, since 1993 — after almost eight years\r\nof extensive and substantive deliberations — the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council reform has\r\nyet to produce a concrete and universally acceptable\r\nformula that would enable us to achieve the long-\r\noverdue reforms.\r\nThe fact remains that the outcome of eight years\r\nof intensive discussions on Council reform is in clear\r\ncontrast to the urgency expressed on many occasions\r\nfrom this rostrum by an overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States, and also at the highest possible level\r\nduring the Millennium Summit.\r\nThe report of the Working Group before us is a\r\nreflection of the frustrating stalemate that we have\r\nwitnessed since the establishment of the Group, as the\r\nreport is but a mere compilation of opposing ideas and\r\nproposals that we have been considering for eight years\r\nnow. Of course, we acknowledge the progress that has\r\nbeen made in certain aspects of Security Council\r\nreform, in particular with respect to the Council’s\r\nworking methods, as well as the usefulness of the ideas\r\nthat have been presented so far. In fact, the lengthy\r\ndeliberations within the Working Group have allowed\r\nus to identify a number of key elements for a reform\r\npackage that are agreed on by the majority of the\r\nmembership.\r\nThese elements are: first, the need to reform the\r\ncomposition and functioning of the Security Council in\r\norder to make that body more representative; secondly,\r\nthe need to consider the question of the veto\r\nconcurrently with that of an increase in the Security\r\nCouncil’s membership; thirdly, the need further to\r\nimprove the Council’s working methods and its\r\ndecision-making process in order to ensure greater\r\nopenness, transparency and democracy within it;\r\nfourthly, the need to consider all aspects of reform as\r\nan integrated whole; and fifthly, the need periodically\r\nto review a reformed Council.\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that the elements of a\r\nsolution are available to us. What is lacking is not ideas\r\nor proposals, but the necessary political will and a\r\nconcrete commitment to achieve our common goal, as\r\nstated in General Assembly resolution 48/26 and\r\nreiterated in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nAllow me briefly to reiterate and elaborate on my\r\ncountry’s position on Security Council reform.\r\nFirst, the ultimate goal of this reform is to\r\nenhance democratic and equitable representation within\r\nthe Council as well as its accountability, credibility and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council should reflect the\r\npolitical and economic realities of today’s world. It\r\nmust have the necessary democratic legitimacy to act\r\non behalf on the international community in the\r\nprocess of discharging the mandate conferred upon it\r\nby the Charter.\r\nThirdly, these objectives cannot be achieved\r\nwithout expanding both categories of members —\r\npermanent and non-permanent. A restructured Security\r\nCouncil should adequately represent the developing\r\ncountries and those industrialized countries that have\r\nmet the criteria laid down in the Charter.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nIn this context, Tunisia remains firm in its\r\nsupport of the African position and the legitimate and\r\namply justified request of the African countries to\r\nallocate to Africa two permanent seats, with all of the\r\nprivileges granted to members in this category, and two\r\nadditional non-permanent seats. Tunisia also supports\r\nthe rotation formula endorsed by the African heads of\r\nState and Government. We believe, however, that this\r\nformula is not to be imposed as an option on the other\r\nregional groups. It is also in this context that Tunisia\r\nsupports the allocation of permanent seats to Japan and\r\nGermany, which we view as candidates worthy of\r\npermanent membership in the Security Council.\r\nFourthly, the Non-Aligned Movement’s fallback\r\nposition is to be considered only as a last resort, if and\r\nwhen we have exhausted all efforts to reach agreement\r\non the expansion of the category of permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nFifthly, the issue of the veto must be addressed as\r\nan integral part of the reform package.\r\nIn this regard, Tunisia supports the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s position that we should limit the use of the\r\nveto to actions taken under Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nIt goes without saying that it is crucial that the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council have a\r\npositive and constructive attitude on this issue. In the\r\nexpansion of the number of permanent members, one\r\nsole veto should not be allowed to bring Council’s\r\ndecisions to a halt.\r\nSixthly, the working methods of the Council and\r\nits subsidiary bodies, in particular the sanctions\r\ncommittees, must be further improved in order to\r\nenhance the Council’s transparency, accountability and\r\neffectiveness. In this particular area, we are happy to\r\nnote the Working Group’s progress in achieving a\r\nconvergence of views on many of these questions. We\r\nalso note with satisfaction that the Security Council\r\nitself is contributing to this process.\r\nFinally, the issue of the periodic review of the\r\nreformed Security Council is an indispensable element\r\nof the reform package and has to be seriously\r\nconsidered. Such a review should be viewed as a\r\nconfidence-building measure that would allow us to\r\nmake any necessary adjustments in the future. More\r\nimportantly, it would provide us with an accountability\r\nmechanism making it possible to assess the\r\ncontribution of new members in adding to the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council.\r\nWe are concerned that the deadlock prevailing in\r\nthe Working Group’s deliberations is worsening. The\r\nfact remains that without a genuine political will and\r\nspirit of compromise, the whole reform process will be\r\nan exercise in futility. International relations must free\r\nthemselves from the attitudes of the pre-Second World\r\nWar period. Fifty years — almost two generations —\r\nhave passed. It is time to adapt international\r\ninstitutions to the realities of the modern world. We\r\nwill gain in representation, effectiveness and, most\r\ncertainly, democracy.\r\nThe President of the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly underlined the points of divergence\r\nand convergence in his statement delivered at the\r\nclosure of the fifty-fifth session. He also concluded, in\r\nthe light of the answers to his letter addressed to the\r\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs of all Member States, that\r\nwe must bring the issue of Council reform to a higher\r\npolitical level and directly involve our decision-makers\r\nin the process. We strongly support this approach,\r\nwhich will enable us to drive the reform process\r\nforward and proceed to the next step: the drafting of a\r\nreform package outline to which all of us aspire.\r\nMy delegation encourages the President, as\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Working Group, to use his\r\nauthority and diplomatic skills to move the process of\r\nCouncil reform ahead. We hope that his efforts will\r\nresult in concrete and decisive recommendations to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that can be presented by the\r\nWorking Group on the occasion of its tenth\r\nanniversary.\r\nWe look forward to cooperating closely with the\r\nPresident and his two Vice-Chairmen in order to make\r\nthe necessary progress towards reaching this objective.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): As has\r\nbeen reiterated on so many occasions, the most\r\nceremonious of which was the Millennium Summit\r\nover a year ago, the majority of Member States\r\nadvocate a Security Council that is more transparent,\r\ndemocratic, representative and accountable. Those who\r\nwant a change for the better are in the majority, not\r\nthose who defend the status quo with the ambition of\r\njoining it.\r\nAn effective, fair and democratic reform of the\r\nSecurity Council will be possible only if consensus is\r\nreached on every component of reform. Hence, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Council reform is of\r\nfundamental importance. More than ever, Spain\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nchampions the usefulness and necessity of the Working\r\nGroup for several reasons.\r\nFirst, the greater transparency achieved in the\r\nCouncil’s working methods is the result of the efforts\r\nover the last eight years of many delegations in the\r\nWorking Group, including mine. If today we are able to\r\nwelcome undeniable progress in the field of\r\ntransparency, it is mostly due to the debates and\r\nnegotiations undertaken in the Working Group. Yet,\r\nthere still remains a lot to be done, as we explained at\r\nlength in our statement on item 11, “Report of the\r\nSecurity Council”, two weeks ago.\r\nMoreover, we are, unfortunately, far from\r\nreaching general agreement on the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council. Consequently, discussions have to\r\ncontinue, for we must not forget that Council reform is\r\na multifaceted issue, as noted in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which calls for “a comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council in all its aspects”. The Working\r\nGroup is the only existing forum for achieving that\r\ncomprehensive reform to which our high-level\r\nrepresentatives committed themselves on 8 September\r\n2000. Approaches aimed at settling key aspects of\r\nCouncil expansion separately, and even in forums other\r\nthan the Working Group on Council reform, will not\r\nlead to the necessary consensus.\r\nMy delegation has stated on many occasions that\r\nit favours expansion of the Security Council, but only\r\nin the number of non-permanent members.\r\nThe veto issue is the essential question of Council\r\nreform. Currently, the Working Group on Council\r\nreform is the only forum in which we can discuss this\r\nvery important issue. The issue is of capital\r\nimportance. An overwhelming majority of States\r\nunequivocally wish to eliminate or at least curtail this\r\nunequalled instrument of power.\r\nNonetheless, we are aware that our aspiration is\r\nsomewhat illusory in nature, since those who have the\r\nveto are not likely to renounce it, even partially. We\r\nknow as well that the condition of being a permanent\r\nmember is inexorably linked to the veto power. Bearing\r\nthis in mind, the unavoidable question is: are we aware\r\nof what the result would be — in the year 2001, 56\r\nyears after the Second World War — of increasing the\r\nnumber of permanent members on the basis of\r\nquestionable criteria, and of granting them this all-\r\nembracing power that could undermine any\r\nresolution — as new members would also have the veto\r\npower? Can we today collectively and bitterly lament\r\nthat the United Nations has not been able to act\r\nbecause the veto of a single Member has paralysed it,\r\nand then tomorrow grant this power of paralysis to\r\nanother select handful?\r\nThe veto is a crucial element of the reform,\r\nparticularly of the expansion of the membership. In the\r\ntwenty-first century, when Member States are\r\nclamouring to curtail the existing veto power, it would\r\nbe at the very least odd to grant it to another group of\r\ncountries. The paradox aside, we would be creating a\r\nnew class of privileged States, thus doing a disservice\r\nto the United Nations.\r\nMs. Murnaghan (Ireland): It is not surprising\r\nthat many of the statements we have heard here\r\nyesterday and today have had a common theme — that\r\nthe world we are now living in is a very different place\r\nto that which existed when we addressed the topic of\r\nSecurity Council reform in the General Assembly at\r\nthis time last year, or even when the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group concluded its work for this year in\r\nJuly. We clearly live in a changed world. This must\r\ngive us pause for reflection as to whether the\r\ninstitutions that serve us, most particularly in the\r\nUnited Nations, are equipped to meet the challenges of\r\na more complex world or whether they need to be\r\nadapted.\r\nWe have seen, in fact, that the United Nations has\r\nso far responded extremely well — some might say,\r\nsurprisingly well — to the enormous challenge that the\r\nhorrendous events of 11 September 2001 have\r\npresented.\r\nWe have seen how quickly and concretely both\r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly reacted\r\nin the days following the outrage perpetrated against\r\nthe United States and, by extension, the rest of the\r\nworld, because terrorism is an outrage to all freedom-\r\nloving people everywhere. The United Nations has\r\nseen its role enhanced as the body where, with the\r\nnecessary political will, effective action in the\r\ninternational fight against terrorism can be taken.\r\nIt is nevertheless understandable perhaps, in the\r\ncontext of everything else going on, if some issues\r\nsuddenly seem less immediate. Some might feel, for\r\nwhatever reasons, that the question of reform of the\r\nSecurity Council — which, after all, has been under\r\ndiscussion for eight years already — may perhaps be\r\nless urgent just now.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nOn the contrary, we believe that just as the role of\r\nthe United Nations has grown in importance, so too has\r\nthat of the Security Council. The Council showed that\r\nwhen the situation truly demanded it, it could act\r\ncollectively, promptly and with determination.\r\nHowever, while welcoming the prompt and proactive\r\nresponse of the Council, we believe that this new, even\r\nmore complex world we live in makes reform of the\r\nCouncil more important, not less, and, equally, makes\r\nit more, not less, urgent. We continue to wish to see a\r\nCouncil that structurally and procedurally is more\r\nreflective of current world realities and is even more\r\ntransparent.\r\nThe Millennium Summit in September 2000 set a\r\nnumber of challenges for the United Nations and for all\r\nof us as Member States. In particular, our heads of\r\nState and Government resolved “To intensify our\r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects.” (resolution 55/2,\r\npara. 30) Speaking from this podium last year we said\r\nthat this was a clear challenge that required adequate\r\nresponse in the creativity, flexibility and determination\r\nthat we as Member States had to bring to the issue of\r\nreform. As the representative of Belgium noted\r\nyesterday, however, discussions in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group over the past year showed how difficult\r\nit is in practice to reach agreement in this area.\r\nLet us be frank: while there was some progress on\r\nworking methods and a useful discussion on the veto,\r\nthe overall results did not live up to expectations. We\r\nvery much welcomed the interesting and interactive\r\ndiscussions between the Open-ended Working Group\r\nand the members of the Council, and we hope that\r\nthese might become a more regular occurrence in the\r\nfuture. We nevertheless believe there is more we can do\r\nin the Open-ended Working Group, provided the\r\nnecessary will is there. Indeed, we are enjoined to do\r\nmore by our political leaders.\r\nWe encourage the Council, for its part, to pursue\r\nin tandem its efforts to make its work more transparent.\r\nIn this regard, we commend the greater openness\r\ntowards troop-contributing countries, and we\r\nencourage continuing enhancement of the tripartite\r\nrelationship between the Security Council, troop-\r\ncontributing countries and the Secretariat. As a current\r\nmember of the Council, and as President during\r\nOctober, we were pleased to preside over discussions\r\nwithin the Council on reviewing possible changes to\r\nthe format and content of the annual report of the\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly and hope to see\r\nresults in next year’s report.\r\nAllow me at this point, to pay tribute to the\r\nprevious Chairman, Harri Holkeri, and to the two Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Open-ended Working Group,\r\nAmbassadors de Saram and Ingólfsson, for their\r\nsterling work over the past year. President Holkeri’s\r\nefforts were directed at making the work of the Group\r\nmore focused and productive, and he deserves all credit\r\nfor this. We greatly appreciated the extensive\r\nbackground documentation that the Bureau prepared to\r\nhelp the Open-ended Working Group’s consideration,\r\nin particular, of cluster II issues. This helped the Group\r\naddress individual issues in a more sharply focused\r\nway, but in the event, there was little advance on the\r\nmain substantive issues.\r\nAs a member of a group of 10 countries that has\r\nattempted over the years to address the issues of reform\r\nin a pragmatic and realistic way, we still believe that\r\nthere is useful work that the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup can do in bringing the reform dossier to a point\r\nwhere, as Mr. Holkeri stated in his concluding remarks\r\nat the close of the fifty-fifth session of the Assembly, a\r\nmove to negotiations can be made. We are supportive\r\nof the idea of taking reform to a higher political level,\r\nbut remain open at this point as to the exact form and\r\ntiming. Our principal concern, however, is to address\r\nreform in a comprehensive manner, recalling that we\r\nhave been tasked to address reform “in all its aspects”\r\nwith the aim of achieving a reformed Security Council\r\nthat is more representative of the membership, more\r\ntransparent in its working methods and more effective\r\noverall.\r\nMr. Holkeri also rightly pointed to the central\r\nposition of the veto in any outcome on reform of the\r\nCouncil. We still believe that the proposals that Ireland,\r\ntogether with other countries, presented some time ago\r\nregarding limitations on the scope and application of\r\nthe veto as part of a global approach to reform continue\r\nto provide a pragmatic, achievable, albeit partial,\r\nsolution to this highly political and sensitive problem.\r\nWe would hope that delegations might take a renewed\r\nlook at them.\r\nFinally, Ireland looks forward to taking up again\r\nthe work of the Open-ended Working Group, and I\r\nwish to assure President Han, that my delegation stands\r\nready to work with him, the Bureau and members in\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group in the coming year so\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nas to make real progress towards comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I should like at the outset to express my\r\ngratitude and appreciation to the President of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council and his two Vice-Chairmen for their\r\nlast report, which contains valuable information that\r\nreflects their great efforts to reach a consensus in the\r\narea of strengthening international representation in the\r\nSecurity Council and making it more transparent in its\r\nimplementation of the responsibilities entrusted to it in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nSince the beginning of the last decade the world\r\nhas witnessed the launch of a comprehensive operation\r\nto reform and energize the institutions and activities of\r\nthe United Nations, to have their capabilities and\r\ncontributions rise to the level of the new international\r\nchallenges that occurred as a result of the post-cold-\r\nwar changes and the concepts of the new world order\r\nbased on principles of partnership, democracy and\r\npluralism of interests among States.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit last year the Heads of\r\nState and Government agreed on the need to intensify\r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, because the Council is the main\r\norgan of this Organization, responsible for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, in accordance with\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter. The reform is to reinforce the\r\nCouncil’s various roles in international peace-making\r\nand in protecting humanity from the destruction of war\r\nand the grave violations of human rights.\r\nThe number of United Nations Members was 51\r\nwhen the Organization was founded in 1945, and the\r\nnumber of non-permanent members in the Security\r\nCouncil was six, representing 12 per cent of the full\r\nmembership. Today, with the membership having risen\r\nto 189, the shape of the Council’s present framework\r\ndoes not reflect the actual, democratic or just reality in\r\nrepresenting the international community. This not only\r\nconstitutes a failure in the political formation of the\r\nCouncil, but also weakens the transparency of its\r\ndecisions on many important international issues on its\r\nagenda. Therefore, we strongly support the continued\r\nurgent international desire for substantial reform of its\r\nframework and working methods, including increasing\r\nthe number of members so that its size, composition\r\nand international political activity are better suited to\r\nthe increasing security challenges in international\r\nrelations.\r\nMy country’s delegation, which has closely\r\nfollowed the deliberations conducted by the Open-\r\nended Working Group since 1993, as well as the\r\nvarious initiatives and suggestions that the Chairmen of\r\nthe geographic groups submitted on this matter, is\r\nconcerned about the continued deepening of\r\ndifferences in the views of States, specifically those\r\nrelated to the suggested shape and size of the Council’s\r\nmembership. We renew our full support for the Non-\r\nAligned Movement’s position on this matter and\r\nannounce our adherence to three principal elements.\r\nFirst, reform of the Security Council and\r\nexpansion of its membership should be an integral part\r\nof a common, comprehensive project that adheres to\r\nthe principle of equality among States in regard to\r\nsovereignty and just geographic distribution, away\r\nfrom the discriminating policy or selectivity practised\r\ntoday.\r\nSecondly, any increase in the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council should not lead to an increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent seats of the\r\ndeveloped countries at the expense of the developing\r\ncountries. Instead, correcting the inadequate\r\nrepresentation of the developing countries should be\r\ntaken into consideration in any suggested new\r\nformation of the Council, in order to deal with the\r\nexisting failure in geographical representation and to\r\nstrengthen its international political balance.\r\nThirdly, since the Arab States number 21,\r\napproximately 12 per cent of all United Nations\r\nMember States, we call for the allocation of at least\r\ntwo non-permanent seats for Arab representation in the\r\nCouncil, in addition to another permanent rotating seat\r\nfor Arab States within the framework of the mechanism\r\nof understanding between the Asian and African\r\nGroups. This would contribute to reinforcing the\r\neffective participation of these States, not only in\r\ndealing with their most complicated regional issues,\r\nbut also in enhancing their participation in joint efforts\r\nto establish regional and international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe are satisfied with some of the limited\r\nmeasures adopted during the past couple of years that\r\nhave contributed to the improvement of some of the\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nCouncil’s working methods, especially those relating to\r\nenhancing the openness of its open sessions to reveal\r\nthe positions of member and non-member States on\r\nagenda issues. However, we are greatly disappointed\r\nwith the continuation of unilateral and double-standard\r\npolicies of some permanent and influential members on\r\nsome security and peace issues on the Council’s\r\nagenda. I refer particularly to those policies that have\r\noften prevented the holding of urgent Council meetings\r\nto deal with disappointing developments in the\r\nPalestinian question and the situation in the Middle\r\nEast, or to take mandatory action to halt the murder,\r\nexcessive violence, measures to expand settlements and\r\nsiege, and unethical and irresponsible tampering with\r\nreligious and historical holy sites and property, that the\r\nIsraeli occupation forces practise daily against the\r\nunarmed Palestinian people, with no regard for the\r\nCouncil’s many resolutions, whether those identifying\r\nprinciples for resolving the Palestinian question —\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and others — or\r\nthose that prohibit all Israeli measures that violate the\r\nnorms of international law and human rights\r\ninstruments, foremost of which is the 1949 Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention relative to the Protection of\r\nCivilian Persons in Time of War.\r\nWe therefore stress the necessity to implement a\r\nserious, comprehensive and objective periodic\r\nevaluation of the Council’s working methods in order\r\nto institutionalize its working methods and decision-\r\nmaking practices. We also call for rationalization of the\r\nuse of the veto, especially on topics related to\r\nregrettable developments on some just peoples’ issues\r\nraised at international forums and set forth in the\r\nagendas of this international Organization for more\r\nthan 50 years. Furthermore, this procedure, which is\r\nconsidered most discriminating and unfavourable for\r\nthe vast majority of States, should not constitute an\r\nobstacle to efforts to contain security crises and find\r\njust and lasting solutions to such issues, based on the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy and international law.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations on\r\nthis issue will lead to more constructive international\r\nunderstanding to achieve the desired reforms in the\r\nstructure of the Security Council, a fair increase of its\r\nmembership and improvement of its working methods,\r\nthus guaranteeing the best understanding and discharge\r\nof its increasing responsibilities in the maintenance of\r\nregional and international peace and security.\r\nMr. Serbini (Brunei Darussalam): At the outset, I\r\njoin other speakers in conveying our appreciation to\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fifth session, for facilitating work on this\r\nissue, as well as to the co-Chairs of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on reform of the Security Council for\r\ntheir contributions. The report before us is a\r\nculmination of the hard work and time spent on this\r\nimportant subject.\r\nWhile there has been some progress in the effort\r\nto improve the working methods of the Council, we are\r\nindeed far from reaching our central objective of\r\nrestructuring it. Countless proposals for restructuring\r\nhave been worked out, but, unfortunately, they have not\r\nbeen seriously considered. Views of member countries\r\ncontinue to diverge.\r\nEight years is quite a long period to spend on\r\nsuch an important and complex issue. It is vital that we\r\nnow move on to renew our commitment, as called for\r\nby the Secretary-General. Most important, our leaders\r\nlast year gave us the political mandate to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe rapidly changing world environment has\r\nposed new threats and challenges to international peace\r\nand security. This and the increase in the membership\r\nof the United Nations make reform a compelling\r\nnecessity. At the same time, we must also bear in mind\r\nthat there should be no “quick-fix” solutions to the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council.\r\nLinked to the need for expansion are the most\r\nimportant issues of equitable representation and the use\r\nof the veto. It is encouraging that most Member States\r\nwould like to see additional permanent and non-\r\npermanent members on the Council. However, the\r\nissue of the veto remains a complex one, on which each\r\nMember State has its own agenda. For our part, we feel\r\nthat its use should be curtailed and confined to matters\r\ncoming under Chapter VII of the Charter. The\r\nprospects of its eventual elimination should be\r\nconsidered accordingly. Notwithstanding the difficult\r\nissues that we have to deal with, we must now intensify\r\nour efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects.\r\nIn conclusion, the Security Council of the twenty-\r\nfirst century should fully reflect the aspirations of the\r\nworld’s people. Brunei Darussalam, for its part, offers\r\nits continued support and will work closely with other\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nmembers of the Organization to bring about a\r\nstrengthened Council.\r\nMr. Akopian (Armenia): Armenia attaches great\r\nimportance to Security Council reform and supports the\r\nongoing efforts aimed at the strengthening of the\r\nCouncil and enabling it to react promptly and\r\neffectively to the current challenges and threats. We\r\nbelieve that the reform process must also ensure that\r\nthe most important body responsible for international\r\npeace and security reflects the political and economic\r\nrealities of the world, which has changed dramatically\r\nsince 1945.\r\nEight years ago the General Assembly established\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the reform of\r\nSecurity Council, and some progress has been achieved\r\nduring recent years. However, the reform process has\r\nso far been too slow, and the Council is still not fully\r\nrepresentative of the general membership. We share the\r\nview that this important body should be more\r\nrepresentative and more transparent in its activities and\r\nthat its decisions should be endowed with greater\r\nauthority.\r\nThe positions of most of the Member States on\r\nthe issue of Security Council reform are well known.\r\nThe debates at the Millennium Assembly demonstrated\r\nonce again that the vast majority of Member States\r\nsupports the expansion of the Security Council’s\r\npermanent and non-permanent membership.\r\nWe also believe that real reform lies in expansion\r\nin both categories, in conformity with the principles of\r\nequality and sovereignty among Member States and of\r\nequitable geographical representation.\r\nRecent decades have witnessed a growing\r\ncomplexity of the issue of international security, with\r\nmore countries immediately involved in and\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of global peace.\r\nTherefore, the composition of the bodies responsible\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nmust evolve accordingly. In particular, we strongly\r\nbelieve that the new permanent members must have the\r\nability and readiness to contribute both financially and\r\npolitically to the United Nations activities. In this\r\nregard we support the desire of Germany and Japan to\r\nacquire the status of permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe issue of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation is of particular importance for us. We\r\nsupport the proposals to increase the regional\r\nrepresentation, especially for the regions that are\r\ncurrently under-represented, such as Asia, Africa, Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. In this regard, we believe\r\nthat India deserves to be seriously considered as a\r\ncandidate for permanent membership.\r\nWe believe that any increase in the non-\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council should\r\nensure an enhanced representation of the Group of\r\nEastern European States through the allocation of an\r\nadditional non-permanent seat to this Group.\r\nArmenia favours any step towards greater\r\nopenness and transparency in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. Some progress has already been registered in\r\nthis area. In particular, there are signs of increasing\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council, and the\r\ngrowing number of open debates gives an opportunity\r\nfor non-members to participate in the deliberations of\r\nthis important body.\r\nAs for the right of veto for the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council, it is our understanding that a\r\nnumber of States support its curtailment or elimination.\r\nWe hope that the Working Group will reach a\r\nconsensus on this matter, making the Security Council\r\ncapable of facing the challenges of this century. We\r\nstrongly believe that the effectiveness of the Council\r\nmust be maintained. A Council capable of effectively\r\ncarrying out its responsibilities is of paramount\r\nimportance for all of us.\r\nAs we all recall, the Millennium Declaration calls\r\nupon Member States “To intensify our efforts to\r\nachieve a comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in all its aspects” (resolution 55/2, para. 30). It\r\nis our common responsibility to translate this\r\ncommitment into reality. Recent developments in world\r\npolitics and international relations suggest that reform\r\nof the body responsible for international security\r\ncannot be delayed any longer. In this regard, we\r\nsupport the suggestions concerning this process made\r\nby the General Assembly President, Harri Holkeri, in\r\nhis statement on the last day of the fifty-fifth session.\r\nSince the whole process of United Nations reform\r\ncannot be completed without reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, we will support any effort that can facilitate\r\nthe accomplishment of this objective. We hope that this\r\nprocess will reinforce the credibility of this important\r\nbody and lead us to a more representative and efficient\r\nSecurity Council.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.34\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform Members\r\nof some changes to the programme of work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAgenda item 23, “Building a peaceful and better\r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”, which was\r\nscheduled for Friday morning, 2 November 2001, will\r\ninstead be taken up on Tuesday morning, 11 December.\r\nAgenda item 171, “Observance of the\r\nInternational Day for Preventing the Exploitation of the\r\nEnvironment in War and Armed Conflict”, originally\r\nscheduled for Tuesday morning, 6 November, will now\r\nbe taken up on Monday morning, 5 November, as the\r\nsecond item.\r\nThe announcement of voluntary contributions to\r\nthe 2001 programmes of the United Nations Relief and\r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near-East,\r\noriginally scheduled for Tuesday, 4 December, will\r\nnow take place on Friday, 7 December 2001, at 11 a.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
