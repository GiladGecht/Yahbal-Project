(Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Botnaru\r\n(Republic of Moldova), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 49 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): It is a\r\ngreat privilege for me to speak on this important\r\nagenda item. The question of equitable representation\r\non the Security Council and the urgent need to expand\r\nits membership have been discussed in the General\r\nAssembly, and in the Working Group set up for that\r\npurpose, in a continuous manner during the past eight\r\nyears. An acceptable outcome is still far beyond our\r\nreach. This is a critical moment for the Working Group:\r\nwe should either throw in the towel or move the Group\r\nto a new stage — a stage of true and faithful\r\nnegotiations, with a view to reaching a solution agreed\r\nupon by all Members of the United Nations.\r\nIn this connection, I commend the previous\r\nPresident of the Assembly, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his\r\ndedication to the work of the Working Group and for\r\ntaking the initiative to write to his counterparts and\r\nseek their views and assistance so as to make further\r\nprogress in the exercise. We also congratulate the two\r\nVice-Chairmen of the Working Group, Ambassador\r\nJohn de Saram of Sri Lanka and Ambassador\r\nThorsteinn Ingólfsson of Iceland, for their patience and\r\npainstaking efforts in guiding the discussions in the\r\nWorking Group during the previous session.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit the heads of State and\r\nGovernment agreed to intensify efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. A new\r\nmomentum emerged since the Summit, and we should\r\nwork much harder to carry out the mandate set out in\r\nthe Summit Declaration.\r\nThe United Nations cannot afford to fail in this\r\nimportant task, or the credibility of the Organization as\r\na whole will be put at substantial risk. My delegation\r\ntherefore strongly supports the view that more vigorous\r\nefforts should be made by all countries — the five\r\npermanent members of the Security Council in\r\nparticular — to move the process of reforming the\r\nSecurity Council forward.\r\nWe are now at a crossroads in our exercise to\r\nachieve a reformed and expanded Security Council that\r\nis more transparent and democratic in its work and\r\nmore accountable and representative in its membership.\r\nObviously, there is a general agreement among all\r\nMember countries on the need to reform the working\r\nmethods and to expand the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil. There is also concrete agreement on principles\r\nand criteria for renovating the working methods of the\r\nCouncil, as correctly reflected in the report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nThere are, however, clear differences of view\r\namong Member countries concerning expansion of the\r\npermanent membership and ways to deal with the\r\ndecision-making modes, the veto power in particular.\r\nThe whole process is truly very complex and\r\nchallenging. There is no doubt that the common\r\nobjective is to bring the Council better into tune with\r\nthe economic and political realities of our time and to\r\nenable it to be better equipped to deal with the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. The enormous\r\nincrease of the general membership of the United\r\nNations following the demise of the colonial age has\r\nbrought a call for redressing the serious imbalance in\r\nthe membership of the Council.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council will be\r\ndurable and fruitful only if it fully reflects the\r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of States,\r\nequitable geographical distribution, accountability,\r\ndemocratization and transparency in the working\r\nmethods and procedures of the Council, including its\r\ndecision-making process. The genuine legitimacy of\r\nthe decisions of the Council relies heavily on the\r\nmeasure of its accountability to the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nViet Nam’s position in this matter is clear. It has\r\nbeen stated on various occasions, both in this forum\r\nand in the Open-ended Working Group. I wish to\r\nreiterate that Viet Nam strongly supports an increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories.\r\nAs regards the new permanent members, Viet\r\nNam shares the view that developing countries must\r\nhave appropriate representation on the Council, taking\r\ninto account the fact that most of the issues under the\r\nauthority of the Council today involve or are of vital\r\ninterest to the developing countries. Developing\r\ncountries from the three regions of Asia, Africa and\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean must have their\r\npermanent representatives in an expanded Security\r\nCouncil. On the other hand, it is reasonable that new\r\npermanent seats should be allocated to industrialized\r\ncountries that are willing to undertake greater\r\ncommitments to the work of the United Nations. Viet\r\nNam supports the aspirations of countries such as\r\nIndia, Japan and Germany to permanent seats in the\r\nCouncil.\r\nGiven the fact that there are quite a number of\r\ncountries that may be eligible to become new\r\npermanent members of the Security Council, Viet Nam\r\nis willing to support the proposal to work out rotation\r\narrangements that will allow more countries to serve on\r\nthe Council.\r\nAny formula of reform will fail to be satisfactory\r\nif the veto power is left intact. In this respect, our\r\ndelegation wishes to reaffirm that, pending its final\r\nelimination, that power should be used only with the\r\ngreatest restraint and only on issues that fall under\r\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter. In the\r\nmeantime, Viet Nam shares the view that new\r\npermanent members of the Council should enjoy that\r\nprivilege in accordance with the principle of sovereign\r\nequality. This will also help to redress the inherent\r\nimbalance of power between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries within the Council.\r\nWith reforms taken along these lines, we are\r\nconfident that the United Nations, including the\r\nSecurity Council, will be enabled to make further\r\npositive contributions to realizing mankind’s shared\r\naspirations to peace, independence, justice and\r\nprosperity.\r\nMr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nFirst of all, please allow me to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession and former Chairman of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council, and his two deputies, Ambassador\r\nIngólfsson and Ambassador De Saram, for their\r\nvigorous efforts in the preparation for and smooth\r\nrunning of the Working Group. We believe that, under\r\nMr. Han’s guidance, the Open-ended Working Group\r\nwill achieve further positive results.\r\nMr. Holkeri pointed out at the concluding\r\nmeeting of the fifty-fifth session that\r\n“there is a common recognition that the Council\r\nneeds to reflect the realities of the twenty-first\r\ncentury to better serve the interests of peace and\r\nsecurity”. (A/55/PV.112, p. 3)\r\nThis indeed reflects the general view of Member States\r\non Security Council reform. Over the past 50 years and\r\nmore since the founding of the United Nations, great\r\nchanges have taken place on the international scene\r\nand in the United Nations itself. In our view, the\r\nSecurity Council needs appropriate and necessary\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nreforms in order to adapt itself to these changes and the\r\nneeds of the times and to fulfil more effectively its\r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity in accordance with the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe most notable change in this Organization\r\nsince its foundation more than half a century ago has\r\nbeen the growth of its membership from 51 at the time\r\nof its establishment to the present 189 members, most\r\nof which are developing countries, making the United\r\nNations truly the most representative\r\nintergovernmental international organization in the\r\nworld. Therefore, the overriding priority in the reform\r\nof the Council is to correct the imbalance of its\r\ncomposition and to increase the representation of\r\ndeveloping countries, in accordance with the principle\r\nof equitable geographical distribution, so that the\r\ncomposition of the Council will reflect the current\r\nreality of the membership of the United Nations. Only\r\nthus can the reform be of practical significance and\r\nconform to the common aspirations and interests of all\r\nMember States.\r\nIn September last year, the Millennium Summit\r\nof the United Nations adopted the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which, inter alia, expresses the resolve of\r\nour heads of State and Government\r\n“to intensify our efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in\r\nall its aspects”. (resolution 55/2, para. 30)\r\nThis represents the solemn commitment of the\r\nleaders of all Member States to Security Council\r\nreform. In order to implement this commitment, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group conducted a series of\r\ndiscussions on Security Council reform, in which\r\nMember States participated in an active manner. Over\r\nthe past year, the Open-ended Working Group has\r\nmade no remarkable progress in any area except the\r\nworking methods of the Council. This demonstrates\r\nonce again that reform of the Security Council involves\r\nthe interests of all countries and that there are therefore\r\ndiffering views, positions and concerns when it comes\r\nto issues of importance and principle. In order to\r\nimplement the will of the leaders of Member States,\r\nthere should be full, careful and in-depth discussions\r\nand exchanges of views among the Member States so\r\nas to seek solutions on the basis of consensus. We\r\ncannot simply impose a specific timetable.\r\nThe Chinese delegation supports the continuation\r\nof in-depth discussions on reform within the Open-\r\nended Working Group. At present, almost all Members\r\nare seriously concerned about how to enable the Open-\r\nended Working Group to achieve greater progress. We\r\nhave taken note of the indication by the President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, in his\r\nremarks at its concluding meeting, that many countries\r\nbelieve that “the time may have come to consider other\r\navenues that would advance this process”\r\n(A/55/PV.112, p. 4). We feel that his remarks are quite\r\ninspiring to our efforts to identify priorities and\r\nworking methods for the future work of the Open-\r\nended Working Group and therefore merit our\r\nattention. The Chinese delegation will continue to\r\nsupport and participate actively in the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group and to join hands with all\r\nother Members to facilitate the reform process.\r\nMr. Navarrete (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nToday’s meeting and the debate that has taken place in\r\nrecent days mark the beginning of a new year in the\r\nconsideration of the item on Security Council reform,\r\nin accordance with the decision adopted by the General\r\nAssembly in the closing days of the fifty-fifth session,\r\nwhen it took note of the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group for that year.\r\nIn the course of our consideration of this\r\nquestion, the Open-ended Working Group established\r\nby resolution 48/26 has made progress towards the\r\nobjective for which it was created: designing a more\r\nrepresentative, more democratic and more transparent\r\nSecurity Council capable of successfully meeting the\r\nchallenges of the new century. That is a task to which\r\nMexico is deeply committed.\r\nIt has been clear throughout the Working Group’s\r\ndeliberations that Security Council reform is no easy\r\ntask. The aim is ambitious: in-depth reform of the\r\nstructure and working methods of an organ whose\r\ndecisions affect all Member States. The political\r\nsensitivity of these matters precludes hasty progress or\r\ndramatic change. But with tenacity and dedication we\r\nhave succeeded in making the international community\r\naware of the need for reform, and we have identified\r\nthe main issues that must be resolved.\r\nSecurity Council reform is an indivisible package\r\nwhose elements cannot be dealt with in a fragmented\r\nmanner. Decisions cannot be taken on them one by one\r\nor step by step: the Working Group must adopt a\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\ncomprehensive package by general agreement, in\r\nconformity with resolution 48/26, which initiated this\r\nexercise. The package must, at the least, include the\r\nfollowing elements: a reasonable increase in the\r\nnumber of Council members on the basis of the\r\nsovereign equality of States and equitable geographical\r\ndistribution; rules relating to the privilege of the veto;\r\nand substantive changes in working methods with a\r\nview to improved transparency and openness.\r\nThe areas in which there has been the most\r\nprogress relate to the Security Council’s working\r\nmethods: the so-called cluster II issues. We must\r\nacknowledge that the Working Group’s deliberations\r\non these issues have influenced the members of the\r\nSecurity Council, which have taken steps to enhance\r\nthe openness and transparency of the Council’s work.\r\nWe welcome the good will they have shown with\r\nrespect to implementing some of the recommendations.\r\nWe urge the members of the Council to continue along\r\nthat path and to find ways to provide a legislative\r\nfoundation for innovative aspects of current practice by\r\nincorporating them into the Council’s provisional rules\r\nof procedure or into other binding documents.\r\nTransparency and openness must become central\r\npillars of the work of the Council, on which the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly have conferred\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Transparency\r\nengenders trust; openness makes possible greater\r\nparticipation by all: we must not forget that the\r\nSecurity Council has no authority of its own and acts\r\non behalf of the General Assembly.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, our heads of State\r\nor Government called for redoubled efforts to attain the\r\ngoal we have set: comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in all its aspects. In that spirit, we must\r\ncontinue to work patiently and with tenacity in the\r\ncontext of the Working Group established by the\r\nAssembly to overcome obstacles without deadlines or\r\nundue haste. We cannot minimize how difficult is the\r\ntask before us. Only comprehensive reform adopted by\r\ngeneral agreement will enjoy political legitimacy and\r\nlegal validity.\r\nMexico reiterates its firm commitment to\r\ncontinue its enthusiastic, dedicated efforts to attain the\r\nprincipal goals of the Working Group.\r\nMr. Stańczyk (Poland): Eight years after the\r\ninception of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters related to the Security Council, adapting the\r\nprincipal organ responsible for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security to the requirements\r\nand challenges of the twenty-first century remains at\r\nthe forefront of the issues before the General\r\nAssembly. The progress achieved so far has been\r\nuneven, and, while we are heartened by what has been\r\nachieved in reforming the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council, we have to recognize that the\r\ndiscussion of crucial issues with which the Working\r\nGroup has been entrusted — equitable representation\r\non and enlargement of the Council — seems to have\r\nreached a dead end.\r\nWhile it is widely recognized that in order to\r\nmeet present and future challenges the United Nations\r\nneeds a reformed Security Council that will reflect the\r\nprofound changes that have taken place on the\r\ngeopolitical scene in recent decades, agreement on\r\npractical ways to achieve that goal still remains\r\nelusive. The lack of tangible progress in fundamental\r\nareas of reform despite several years of discussion has\r\nno doubt been frustrating. It is true that the issues on\r\nthe table are of a complex and sensitive nature, which\r\nmakes the task of reaching general agreement a\r\nformidable challenge. The importance of a successful\r\noutcome of the Security Council reform process for the\r\nfuture of the Organization and for its ability to better\r\ncope with challenges to international peace and\r\nsecurity requires that all the parties to the discussions\r\nwork in a spirit of compromise and show the flexibility\r\nnecessary to move our work forward.\r\nI would like to use this occasion to thank the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his untiring efforts to\r\nfind common ground among the divergent views and\r\nproposals and to move the process from the discussion\r\nphase to the negotiating phase. Our appreciation\r\nextends likewise to the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nWorking Group.\r\nThe General Assembly debate on the question of\r\nequitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters allows us to better grasp the nature of the\r\nchallenges ahead. Although the position of my country\r\non various aspects of Security Council reform has been\r\npresented in this forum on numerous occasions, we feel\r\nthat it is important to highlight once again the gist of\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nour standpoint. Poland views reform of the Security\r\nCouncil as a key component of the overall reform of\r\nthe United Nations and an indispensable element of the\r\neffort to increase the Organization’s effectiveness in\r\ndealing with the complex challenges of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe changed realities of the world should be\r\nrecognized in an agreement that would allow for a\r\nsimultaneous increase in both categories of\r\nmembership. The increase in the permanent-member\r\ncategory should both encompass developed countries\r\nthat have demonstrated their ability and willingness to\r\nact in that role and take into account the legitimate\r\naspirations of developing countries. We believe that\r\nincreasing the composition of the Council by five\r\npermanent members, two of which should be from\r\nindustrialized and three from developing countries,\r\nwould be the optimal solution. While each regional\r\ngroup should have discretion as to the way to select its\r\nrepresentative in this category of membership, its\r\ndecision in that respect should be subject to General\r\nAssembly approval.\r\nAt the same time, the non-permanent category\r\nshould be expanded so as to take into account the\r\nlegitimate interests of all regional groups. The Group\r\nof Eastern European States should be assigned one\r\nadditional non-permanent seat in the Council. Such a\r\nsolution would reflect both the large increase in the\r\nnumber of Members from our regional group in recent\r\nyears and the comprehensive nature of the reform,\r\nincluding in its scope all the regional groupings.\r\nA solution will also be needed with regard to the\r\ndecision-making process, specifically, the question of\r\nthe veto. We recognize the sensitivity of the issue and\r\nthe difficulties lying ahead in the search for a broadly\r\nacceptable solution. A balance will have to be struck\r\nbetween the need to maintain equality of rights in the\r\npermanent member category and the need to enhance\r\nthe efficiency of the Security Council as one of the\r\nmain objectives of its reform.\r\nA comprehensive reform of the Security Council\r\nshould also address the question of the periodic review\r\nof the enlarged Council. Introducing a mechanism\r\nallowing for the evaluation of decisions taken during\r\nthe current reform process would be reassuring for\r\nMember States taking part in the process and thus\r\nconducive to an early agreement.\r\nWe welcome the progress achieved thus far in the\r\nreform of the working methods of the Security Council.\r\nThe work done in this respect in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group during recent years has already yielded\r\npractical and tangible results, and we are confident that\r\nthe current session will bring even further progress.\r\nThe progress achieved in this cluster of issues,\r\nhowever, makes us all the more aware of the need to\r\nmake every effort to achieve similar progress in all\r\naspects of reform, as mandated by resolution 48/26 of\r\n1993. I can assure President Han, that my country will\r\nspare no effort to assist him in his efforts to achieve\r\nthis goal.\r\nMr. Mbanefo (Nigeria): The debate on reform of\r\nthe Security Council has become an annual ritual,\r\nculminating last year in the Millennium Summit\r\ndebate, in which many world leaders made references\r\nin their statements to the question of Security Council\r\nreform. In the Millennium Declaration, the heads of\r\nState and Government resolved “To intensify our\r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects” (resolution 55/2,\r\npara. 30). In his contribution to the Millennium\r\nSummit debate, President Olusegun Obasanjo stressed\r\nthe need to reform the United Nations, in particular to\r\nexpand and democratize the Security Council, which in\r\nhis view is “a task which can no longer be postponed”\r\n(A/55/PV.7, p. 14) if the United Nations is to withstand\r\nfuture challenges.\r\nOur world has changed dramatically in the last 55\r\nyears. It is likely to change more and more in the years\r\nahead. It is therefore naive to believe that the Council\r\nthat was created in 1945, reflecting the geopolitical and\r\ngeostrategic interests or considerations of the\r\nvictorious Allied Powers of the Second World War, is\r\nstill adequate in its composition and practice to cater to\r\nthe needs and interests of our times. Certainly, the\r\npresent composition of the Security Council is lopsided\r\nin favour of a particular group. The Council as\r\npresently constituted cannot be said to be a microcosm\r\nof the 189 Members of our Organization.\r\nMy delegation believes that it has never been the\r\npurpose of the United Nations to prescribe democracy\r\nand change for its Members while making little or no\r\nprogress in the democratization of its own organs, such\r\nas the Security Council. We believe that the United\r\nNations will not be strengthened if reform concentrates\r\nonly on cost-effectiveness, efficiency and better\r\ncoordination. Indeed, no reform of the United Nations\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nwill be complete without addressing issues related to\r\nthe expansion and working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. The thrust of reform, therefore, should include\r\nexpansion of the Council’s membership, improvement\r\nin its working methods and reform of its decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nRegrettably, after more than eight years of\r\ndeliberations, the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nreform of the Council and other related matters has not\r\nmade any appreciable progress. The decision-making\r\nprocess in the Open-ended Working Group is governed\r\nby “general agreement” pursuant to the ninth\r\npreambular paragraph of resolution 48/26 of 3\r\nDecember 1993. In the absence of a precise definition\r\nor meaning, the term “general agreement” has been\r\ninterpreted by some delegations to mean “consensus”.\r\nHowever, in his speech of 12 September 2000 in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Secretary-General stated, inter\r\nalia,\r\n“Consensus is highly desirable, but it need\r\nnot mean waiting for absolute unanimity on every\r\nsub-clause among 189 Member States. A\r\nminority, often a very small minority, should not\r\nwithhold its consent unreasonably. ... We can no\r\nlonger afford to always operate at the level of the\r\nlowest, and slowest, common denominator.”\r\n(A/55/PV.10, p. 2)\r\nMy delegation subscribes to that statement of the\r\nSecretary-General. The time has come for the Working\r\nGroup to revisit its decision-making process in the\r\nlight of this statement. A handful of States cannot hold\r\nthe Working Group to ransom in the name of general\r\nagreement or consensus. We believe that a more\r\nplausible and practical approach is for the General\r\nAssembly, in the light of the Secretary-General’s\r\nstatement, to apply resolution 53/30 of 23 November\r\n1998 to the decision-making process of the Open-\r\nended Working Group.\r\nNotwithstanding the apparent lack of progress,\r\nespecially on cluster I issues, the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup has registered provisional agreement on some\r\ncluster II issues. Areas where provisional agreement\r\nhas been reached include greater transparency in\r\ninformal consultations, more involvement of troop-\r\ncontributing countries, more formal open meetings of\r\nthe Council, a more substantial report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly and more prompt and\r\ndetailed briefings on the Council’s activities by the\r\nPresident in office.\r\nWe note that the Security Council is already\r\nimplementing some of the suggestions in these areas.\r\nWe welcome the increased interaction between the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group and the Council. That\r\ntrend should continue.\r\nOn the very important question of the\r\nenlargement of the Council, Nigeria wishes to recall its\r\nprevious position. We believe that the Security Council\r\nshould be much more reflective of contemporary global\r\nrealities. It should therefore be made more\r\nrepresentative of the membership of the United Nations\r\ntoday. The enlargement of the Council should take\r\nplace in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories, and it should take into account the principle\r\nof equitable geographical representation. Other criteria,\r\nsuch as whether States are emerging regional players or\r\ncentres of economic power, should also be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\nIn this regard, Nigeria unequivocally supports the\r\nposition of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nwhich calls for the allocation of two permanent seats\r\nfor Africa in an enlarged Security Council. Africa, with\r\nits 53 Member States, collectively constitutes almost\r\none third of the entire membership of the United\r\nNations. We believe, therefore, that the OAU’s decision\r\nto seek two permanent seats for Africa in a reformed\r\nand expanded Council cannot be ignored.\r\nMy delegation believes that the essence of reform\r\nis to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the\r\nCouncil. In this regard, expansion of the Council to 26\r\nmembers will not detract from its effectiveness. The\r\nfate of the new permanent members should be\r\ninextricably linked so as to forestall the so-called quick\r\nfix: no single State should become a permanent\r\nmember until the remaining new permanent members\r\nare elected in the General Assembly.\r\nWith regard to the related question of the veto as\r\na voting instrument in the Security Council, Nigeria\r\nsupports the curtailment of its use by the permanent\r\nmembers of the Council. We would even support its\r\nabolition if that is the consensus of the international\r\ncommunity. However, if the veto is to be retained in its\r\npresent form, it is my delegation’s view that it should\r\nbe extended to new permanent members of the Council.\r\nTo deny the veto to new permanent members in an\r\nenlarged Security Council would not only be\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\ndiscriminatory but would also create two different\r\nclasses of permanent membership.\r\nHowever, in order to forestall any abuses of the\r\nexercise of the veto — if the veto is to be retained — it\r\nmay be necessary for the General Assembly to adopt a\r\nresolution reminding the permanent members of the\r\nfact that they are acting on behalf of the United Nations\r\nas a whole, and that they should therefore exercise the\r\nveto only when they consider the question to be of vital\r\nimportance, taking into consideration the interests of\r\nthe United Nations; and that they should also state in\r\neach case, in writing, on what grounds they consider\r\nthe conditions for a veto to be present. Nigeria believes\r\nthat the veto should not be used for the attainment of\r\nselfish or parochial interests.\r\nThere is a general agreement on the need for a\r\ncoherent and coordinated approach to render the\r\nSecurity Council more efficient and increasingly\r\ncapable of addressing universal challenges. Universal\r\nchallenges come in different forms and therefore need\r\ndifferent responses. The Security Council has primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Not only must its decisions and\r\nactions command legitimacy, but it must also be seen\r\nby other players within the international system to be\r\ntransparent, democratic and timely. In this regard, a\r\nreformed Council is inevitable. We urge all Member\r\nStates to demonstrate the political will needed to\r\nachieve, in a timely fashion, the desired reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Duval (Canada) (spoke in French): Speaking\r\non the topic of the reform of the Security Council has\r\nbecome a perennial event. But instead of simply\r\nrestating our position on the proceedings of the Open-\r\nended Working Group, we have, over the years, found\r\nit more useful to focus on the changes that the Security\r\nCouncil can and should implement until there is\r\nagreement on its comprehensive reform.\r\nI will therefore focus my comments on aspects of\r\nthe Security Council’s working methods — what we\r\ncall cluster II issues in Security Council reform\r\nparlance — a cluster which we feel need to be\r\nimproved.\r\nFirst, the Security Council still conducts far too\r\nmuch of its regular business behind closed doors. Some\r\nof its meetings involve briefings from the Secretariat\r\non important developments in relation to whatever the\r\nsubject matter is — often peacekeeping operations.\r\nFollowing these briefings, Security Council members\r\noffer their views on these developments. None of this\r\ninformation needs to be withheld from Member States\r\nof this Organization. In our view, there are few\r\noccasions when the Council needs to meet in camera.\r\nSo what are the factors that are continuing to\r\nprevent the Council from achieving the proper balance\r\nof open and closed meetings? First, open meetings\r\nhave typically been rather dull and long-winded\r\naffairs — a fact that has lessened the Council’s interest\r\nin holding them. This need not be so. Interventions do\r\nnot need to state and restate well-known national\r\npositions. Instead, they should provide an opportunity\r\nto pose questions to Council members and Secretariat\r\nofficials and to respond interactively. In this way open\r\nmeetings would be shorter and certainly more\r\ninteresting.\r\nThe other obstacle is a problem of habit. We\r\ncould even say that informal consultations are the\r\ndefault position of the Council — unless a Council\r\nmember suggests otherwise, often over the objections\r\nof the permanent members, which perhaps feel less\r\ncompunction to respond to the demands of the general\r\nmembership, their tenure being secure. Once again, this\r\nneed not be the case. The default position should be a\r\nmeeting open to Member States of this Organization.\r\nOnly if circumstances require should the Council meet\r\nbehind closed doors.\r\nSecondly, the Council needs to end the fiction\r\nthat informal consultations are not meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council. It serves no one, least of all the\r\nCouncil, to pretend that these meetings do not exist.\r\nInformal consultations are closed meetings of the\r\nCouncil and should be treated as such. This would\r\nensure that official records could be kept of the\r\ndecisions taken.\r\nIt would also ensure that the rights of\r\nparticipation pursuant to Articles 31 and 32 of the\r\nCharter would be respected. Most importantly, it would\r\nmean that meetings of the Security Council would be\r\ntreated with all the seriousness deserving of the organ\r\nwith the primary responsibility for international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThirdly, Security Council working methods could\r\nbe improved by strengthening the relationship between\r\nthe Security Council and troop-contributing countries.\r\nIndeed, we have a consultation process with troop\r\ncontributors and, with the commitments undertaken\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nand renewed in Security Council resolution 1353\r\n(2001), the information and consultation process with\r\nthe troop contributors as a group seems better served.\r\nYet, there is a need to go beyond consultations to\r\ngenuine cooperation with the main contributors of\r\ntroop deployed in complex missions. If properly\r\nexecuted, such cooperation would narrow the\r\naccountability gap between those that make the\r\ndecisions and those that assume the risks. It would also\r\nensure that the Council had the most reliable\r\ninformation at its disposal from the countries with\r\nforces deployed in the field. And it would give the\r\nCouncil access to the perspectives and ideas of the\r\nmajor troop-contributing countries. We hope and\r\nexpect the Security Council Working Group on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations to take to heart the proposal\r\nthat a number of troop-contributing countries have\r\nsubmitted in this regard.\r\nLastly, as we stated a few weeks ago during our\r\nstatement on the report of the Security Council,\r\nhowever compelling the rationale for a veto, it remains\r\ntrue that much of the general membership’s\r\ndissatisfaction with the Council arises from the use or\r\nthe threat of the use of the veto. An overwhelming\r\nnumber of delegations continue to call for limitations\r\non the veto power. The permanent members who\r\nexpect the general membership to respect Council\r\ndecisions need to respond to this demand. As proposed\r\nby one permanent member of the Council two years\r\nago, a voluntary code of conduct would be a good\r\nstarting point. The code could clarify under what\r\ncircumstances veto-empowered members should\r\nconsider it legitimate to exercise the veto — and could\r\nalso, as some colleagues have suggested, require them\r\nto explain their reasons for using it. Such a code would\r\nassist our efforts to reform the Security Council by\r\ninitiating movement on a topic that has long held up\r\nour progress.\r\nWe will refrain from commenting on cluster I\r\nissues today, except to say that we call on those\r\ndelegations that continue to insist that we enlarge the\r\nCouncil in a way that grants them permanent seats to\r\nset aside their national aspirations for the sake of\r\nmoving forward on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nAn agreement on enlarging the Council in the non-\r\npermanent category alone could help us get out of this\r\nquagmire and assure a more representative — and\r\nelected — Council. But as long as a handful of\r\ncountries insist on more individual permanent seats and\r\nadditional new privileges, such agreement will be\r\ndifficult to reach.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Allow me at the outset to express my\r\ndelegation’s gratitude to Mr. Holkeri, the President of\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of General Assembly, for the\r\nmanner in which he conducted the work of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters.\r\nI also wish to extend our thanks to the two Vice-\r\nChairmen, the representative of Sri Lanka and the\r\nrepresentative of Iceland. Their report reflects their\r\ntireless efforts to achieve tangible progress on the\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nWhen the General Assembly decided to establish\r\nthe Working Group on Security Council reform in\r\n1993, we hoped that the Working Group would\r\nconclude its work in a manner meeting the goals set\r\nforth in General Assembly resolution 48/26, so that the\r\nnew composition of the Council would be equitable in\r\nits representation of all geographical areas, democratic\r\nin its decision-making, and more transparent in its\r\nworking methods. If we pause a moment to evaluate\r\nthe results of the negotiations of the past nine years, we\r\nfind that all Member States of the United Nations were\r\nable during that period to express their views and to\r\nsubmit their proposals on Council reform.\r\nTwo years ago, the Assembly adopted resolution\r\n53/30 by consensus. It enabled us to settle the question\r\nof the majority required for adopting any resolution on\r\nCouncil reform. It is clear from the negotiations that\r\nthere is unanimity on the need to reform the Council so\r\nas to reflect the changes witnessed by the United\r\nNations since 1945, particularly the great increase in\r\nthe number of its members, on whose behalf the\r\nCouncil works. Despite the fact that there are numerous\r\nmatters that have not been settled yet, the report of the\r\nWorking Group, contained in document A/55/47,\r\nindicates that there is broad consensus on many\r\nproposals to improve the Council’s working methods.\r\nThe Council has begun work on some of the proposals,\r\nsuch as consulting with troop-contributing countries on\r\npeacekeeping operations and increasing the number of\r\nopen formal meetings. These steps are correct.\r\nHowever, they do not answer all the demands. It is\r\nimportant that the Council take into consideration the\r\nproposals of all Member States and abide by the\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nmeasures aimed at enhancing its links with members of\r\nthe United Nations and at expanding its cooperation\r\nwith regional organizations, in accordance with\r\nrelevant provisions of the Charter. It should also take\r\nnecessary measures to make such proposals binding\r\nand to include them in the rules of procedure of the\r\nCouncil so that such practices would not be tied to the\r\nStates that succeed to its presidency.\r\nIn the framework of the reform process, it is\r\nimportant that the Council cooperate better with the\r\nother main organs of the United Nations system. It is\r\nnot acceptable that its relationship with the General\r\nAssembly be confined to presenting its annual report.\r\nThe Council should submit to the General Assembly\r\nspecial reports as provided for in articles 15 and 24 of\r\nthe Charter, so that both bodies can cooperate closely\r\nin matters relating to international peace and security.\r\nIt is important that the Council foster relations\r\nwith the International Court of Justice by seeking its\r\nadvisory opinions on legal matters. The Council should\r\nabide by its rules of procedure in its meetings, so that\r\nofficial open meetings become the foundation of its\r\ndeliberations. That way, all Member States could\r\nexpress their positions on matters deliberated on in the\r\nCouncil before it adopts resolutions on them. What is\r\ncurrently transpiring in the so-called informal\r\nconsultations, which are the main forum for decision-\r\ntaking, is not characterized by clarity or transparency.\r\nIt does not reflect in most cases the opinions and\r\npositions of Member States. It gives the impression\r\nthat one member or a few permanent members are the\r\nreal decision-makers. This puts the legitimacy of\r\nCouncil’s resolutions in question. The Council then\r\nwould not be characterized as working on behalf of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIncreasing the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil is one of the main elements of Council reform.\r\nAnnex XIII of the Working Group’s report contains\r\nmany important and constructive proposals submitted\r\nby States and groups, including the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. Equal sovereignty among States should\r\nconstitute the basis of any effort to expand the\r\nmembership of the Council. We would like to state here\r\nthat our delegation has continuously maintained that an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Council should be\r\nconfined to the non-permanent category. We are\r\nconvinced that there is no need to create new\r\npermanent members, which would perpetuate the state\r\nof discrimination in the United Nations. If there is an\r\nactual need for new permanent members, their\r\nselection should not be a way of granting privileges to\r\nthose that bear the greatest responsibility for the United\r\nNations budget or that can provide troops and\r\nequipment to peacekeeping operations. Abiding by\r\nsuch criteria would strengthen the grip of the rich and\r\npowerful on the Security Council.\r\nIt is essential to apply the principle of fair\r\ngeographical distribution in the expansion of the\r\nCouncil while taking into consideration the developing\r\ncountries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, some of\r\nwhich are not represented at all. In this regard, we wish\r\nto point out that any increase in the membership of the\r\nCouncil should result in increasing Africa’s\r\nrepresentation. We would like to point to the position\r\nformulated by African leaders in 1997, whereby they\r\nasked for an increase of 11 in the Council’s\r\nmembership, of which two permanent, rotating seats\r\nshould be allocated to Africa in accordance with\r\ncriteria agreed to by Africans themselves.\r\nThe discussions that have so far taken place have\r\nindicated that a main obstacle is the desire not to\r\nrelinquish the privileges that have been gained by\r\nsome, especially the privilege of the veto. Many\r\ncountries object to this, including mine. We are\r\nconvinced that the veto runs counter to the equal\r\nsovereignty of States as guaranteed by the Charter and\r\nundermines the values of justice and democracy. Many\r\narguments have been made for this, including the one\r\nthat holds that bearing the greatest share of\r\nresponsibility for the budget should be the main\r\ncriterion for permanent memberships and for veto\r\npower. If we accept that, then how are we to force such\r\na party to pay its contributions? We have also been told\r\nthat the veto was given to States that have a greater\r\nresponsibility in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. How can we guarantee that their conduct\r\ndoes not run counter to the interests of other States?\r\nThe fact is that the States that emerged victorious\r\nfrom the Second World War gave themselves special\r\nprivileges. The United Nations today is different from\r\nwhat it was over five decades ago. Among the main\r\ndifferences is the fact that its membership stands now\r\nat 189. Two thirds of the current Members were not\r\nMembers then, and had no say about the privileges\r\nconferred upon five States.\r\nMy delegation has for over 30 years maintained\r\nthat the veto should be eliminated. At a minimum, it\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nshould be used sparingly. It cannot be effective unless\r\nspecific conditions are placed on its use, such requiring\r\nat least two negative votes among the permanent\r\nmembers in order to prevent the adoption of a draft\r\nresolution supported by the required majority, or\r\nsubjecting the veto to the General Assembly’s approval\r\nby at least two-thirds majority. We believe that without\r\ntaking these measures, or eliminating the veto, the\r\nprocess of reforming the Security Council will continue\r\nto allow some States to retain their privileges, to have\r\nhegemony over the rest of the world and to control\r\ninternational resolutions.\r\nWe are now in the process of a new round of\r\nnegotiations to reform the Security Council. We hope\r\nthat we will not have to wait a long time before the\r\nWorking Group reaches a conclusion on reform\r\nproposals that has the approval of all members. Our\r\nposition should not be interpreted as a desire to set a\r\ntimetable for the conclusion of this important process.\r\nIn this connection, we support the position adopted by\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, namely, that the efforts at\r\nSecurity Council reform should not be subject to a\r\ntimetable and that it is important to reach a\r\ncomprehensive agreement on all these matters so that\r\nthe Council may be more representative in its\r\nmembership, transparent in its work, and democratic in\r\nits decision-making, and so that it may be accountable\r\nto the entire membership of the Organization\r\nrepresented in the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): During\r\nthe Millennium Summit, heads of State and\r\nGovernment reaffirmed the unique and indispensable\r\nrole of the United Nations in promoting international\r\npeace and shared prosperity. To meet the spirit of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the challenges of the new\r\nmillennium, the functions of the United Nations should\r\nbe strengthened in a systematic manner. For that\r\npurpose, the Organization will have to be reformed in a\r\nway that would allow it to function more effectively\r\nand authoritatively. My delegation firmly believes that\r\nachieving this goal through concerted efforts should\r\nbecome our first priority, particularly at this\r\nextraordinary time when cooperation among Member\r\nStates is sorely needed.\r\nThe most crucial component of this overall\r\nUnited Nations reform process should be the reform of\r\nthe Security Council, given its critical role and\r\nweighted authority in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. The reform of the Security Council\r\nmust be comprehensive, a guiding principle expressed\r\nby the heads of State and Government in last year’s\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nThe reforms should reflect our current reality and\r\nencompass all aspects regarding the structure of the\r\nCouncil, while honouring the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter, as well as emerging principles that can\r\nguide the actions of Member States in the future. We\r\nshould also bear in mind that the reform of the Council\r\nhas implications not only for peace and security, but\r\nalso for a number of other issues, such as improving\r\nthe financial and budgetary structure and upgrading the\r\nUnited Nations role in economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs we have witnessed, a growing number of\r\nStates are playing an increasingly active role in the\r\nwork of the United Nations, and have become\r\nindispensable to the maintenance and promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security. However, only a small\r\nnumber of Member States are given the opportunity to\r\nfully participate in the work of the Security Council.\r\nMoreover, a large majority of Member States are\r\nmarginalized from the Council’s decision-making\r\nprocess. This discrepancy lies at the heart of the\r\nSecurity Council reform effort. While some progress\r\nhas been made in improving the working methods of\r\nthe Council, the most critical issues remain unresolved.\r\nMy delegation firmly believes that, if the United\r\nNations is to be a relevant international actor in the\r\ntwenty-first century, a genuine effort must be made to\r\nenhance the representativeness, transparency and\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council.\r\nReform of the Council, both in its shape and\r\ndecision-making process, should be guided by\r\ndemocratic principles and reflect our current reality.\r\nThe two major sticking points of the Security Council\r\nreform process — the enlargement of the Council and\r\nthe veto power — are inextricably linked, and should\r\ntherefore be considered in one context. A quick and\r\npartial solution for expansion, while setting aside the\r\nquestion of decision-making procedures, is likely to\r\nundermine our efforts to achieve far-reaching\r\ncomprehensive reform.\r\nAs a strong advocate of United Nations reform in\r\ngeneral, and Security Council reform in particular, the\r\nRepublic of Korea has been an active participant in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group since the inception of its\r\nwork eight years ago. I am well aware of the sense of\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nfrustration over the slow pace of the discussions and\r\nthe lack of tangible progress in the group. However, we\r\nmust bear in mind that this stalemate is not due to the\r\nineffectiveness of our discussion process; rather, it is a\r\nreflection of the tremendous implications and\r\npolitically sensitive nature of this issue. My delegation\r\nbelieves that the Working Group, the sole body\r\nmandated by the General Assembly to actively discuss\r\nSecurity Council reform, still remains the best forum\r\nfor advancing reforms.\r\nThe landscape of the world has changed\r\ndramatically since the creation of the United Nations\r\n55 years ago, and these changes should be reflected in\r\nthe structure and decision-making process of the\r\nSecurity Council. And, as I noted earlier, many\r\ncountries contribute to the work of the United Nations\r\nwithout having their views adequately reflected in the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making process. Accordingly, we\r\nshould make a greater effort to find ways to give as\r\nmany countries as possible the opportunity to serve the\r\nCouncil on a more frequent basis.\r\nThe Republic of Korea supports the view that an\r\nincrease only in non-permanent seats is a viable option\r\nfor the time being, if we are unable to reach an\r\nagreement on expansion. This enlargement could be\r\nachieved by allowing more seats to be elected for\r\nregular terms, thereby making the Council more\r\ndemocratic and accountable.\r\nWhile there may have been little progress in the\r\noverall Security Council reform process, there have\r\nbeen marked improvements in the working methods of\r\nthe Council. Among the many positive developments\r\nover the course of the past five years, my delegation is\r\npleased to note the more frequent holding of public\r\nmeetings and improved briefings for non-members of\r\nthe Council. And, as a troop-contributing country and\r\nstrong advocate of Security Council reform, the\r\nRepublic of Korea particularly welcomes the enhanced\r\ncooperation between troop-contributing countries and\r\nthe Security Council. As we experienced over the\r\ncourse of the discussions in the Working Group in the\r\nfifty-fifth session, many constructive proposals to\r\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council\r\nhave been raised by Member States. My delegation\r\nfirmly believes that we must all exert extra effort to\r\nreach conclusions on whatever progress is already in\r\nour reach.\r\nAt this particular time of challenge, unity among\r\nMember States is needed more than ever before.\r\nMy delegation firmly believes that reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should be carried out in such a way as\r\nto unite, rather than divide, Member States. I call upon\r\nall Member States to make an effort to overcome major\r\ndifferences, while remaining faithful to the purposes\r\nand principles of these reform efforts, which we have\r\nalready agreed upon.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): A few\r\ndays ago in this very Hall in the course of discussions\r\non the report of the Security Council, many delegations\r\nexpressed their dissatisfaction with the limited\r\nrepresentative nature of the Council, which, together\r\nwith the lack of transparency in its proceedings, makes\r\nthis body of restricted membership act separately from\r\nthe General Assembly, a truly representative body of\r\nthe international community.\r\nThese criticisms basically reveal that the main\r\norgans of the Organization are not acting in accordance\r\nwith the United Nations Charter, which in Article 24\r\nstipulates, firstly, that all members of the\r\nOrganization — this Assembly — confer on the\r\nSecurity Council the non-exclusive primary\r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. Secondly, it stipulates that the Council, in\r\nfulfilling its duties, acts on behalf of all members. In\r\nother words, the Council is the body that carries out\r\ninstructions and the General Assembly is the body that\r\nissues those instructions.\r\nThese criticisms are not new. They have been\r\nrepeated for years in this Assembly and other forums.\r\nSimilarly, the remedies for these shortcomings have\r\nbeen known for a long time. If the Security Council is\r\nnot sufficiently representative, then the number of its\r\nmembers should be increased. If the Council does not\r\nact with sufficient transparency, then its working\r\nmethods should be modified.\r\nThis logical response has never been refuted.\r\nSince the beginning of consultations on the reform of\r\nthe Council, more than eight years ago, no one could\r\ndeny the need to increase the membership of this body.\r\nSince the first day of consultations, there was\r\nagreement at all times that regardless of the reform to\r\nbe adopted, it should include an increase in the non-\r\npermanent members. There has not been nor is there\r\ndisagreement on this.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nIt is true that there has not been agreement on the\r\nnumber of seats that should be added. But the range\r\nthat is being considered make it possible to predict that\r\nthere would not be major difficulty in reaching\r\nagreement on this point; so this question does not\r\nconstitute a genuine difficulty.\r\nWhy then, if we agree that an urgent need exists\r\nto increase the membership of the Council in order to\r\nimprove its representativity, and if we all agree that, at\r\nthe very least, the number of non-permanent members\r\nshould be increased, why, I repeat, have we do not\r\nthat? We have not done so because the question of an\r\nincrease of the non-permanent membership, on which\r\nthere is no disagreement, has become hostage to the\r\nacceptance of other reforms on which there is no\r\nagreement nor, in my view, any prospect of agreement,\r\nbecause of their highly controversial nature.\r\nWe find ourselves in a paradoxical situation, in\r\nwhich a reform desired by all has been blocked by the\r\ndesire to carry out a controversial reform that does not\r\nhave general support, because it affects basic principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter and of international law,\r\nsuch as the principle of the sovereign equality of all the\r\nMembers of the Organization.\r\nThis has been happening for more than eight\r\nyears with the outcome that we continue to have a\r\nCouncil whose representative nature and working\r\nmethods are unsatisfactory. Frankly, as I do not see any\r\nsigns of change in the position of the groups that\r\nparticipate in the consultations, I fear that this situation\r\ncould continue for at least another eight years.\r\nHowever, the conduct of the consultations at their\r\nmost recent stages could not have been in better hands.\r\nThe President’s predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, and\r\nAmbassadors Thorsteinn Ingólfsson of Iceland and\r\nJohn de Saram of Sri Lanka, have been making patient\r\nand ingenious efforts to lead the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup to tangible results. We have every confidence in\r\nthe continuation of these efforts under the\r\nchairmanship of President Han.\r\nNonetheless, we think that no matter how patient\r\nor ingenious future efforts may be, we will not make\r\nprogress so long as the negotiations continue on the\r\nsame bases and proposals as were put forward eight\r\nyears ago. We therefore believe that if we are to renew\r\nthe Working Group’s mandate for the ninth time we\r\nmust prepare to give the consultations a different\r\ndirections.\r\nThe Working Group now has three options. One\r\nis to delink the question of increasing the\r\nnon-permanent membership and the already accepted\r\nreforms of the working methods from the more\r\ncontroversial issues, thus achieving a simple reform,\r\nwithout prejudice to continuing discussion of other\r\nreforms. Another option is for consultations to continue\r\non the basis of new proposals with a better chance of\r\ngeneral acceptance than those that have been under\r\ndiscussion so far. The third possibility — resuming\r\nconsultations on the old proposals — does not seem\r\nvery promising to my delegation. Choosing this option\r\nwould be very frustrating — unjustifiably so — since it\r\nwould mean preventing wider participation of\r\nMembers of the Organization in the Security Council. I\r\nshall explain why.\r\nIn the course of this debate, some delegations\r\nhave maintained that proceeding to an increase only in\r\nthe non-permanent membership would be detrimental\r\nto the Organization and to ourselves. But nobody has\r\nexplained the nature of this damage, and I cannot\r\nimagine what it might be. On the contrary, as one\r\nspeaker suggested this morning, precisely by not\r\ndelinking these two aspects of the problem we have\r\nharmed the Organization and ourselves. If an increase\r\nin the non-permanent membership had been accepted in\r\nthe year when the consultations began — in 1993 —\r\nand if the increase had been, say, 10 non-permanent\r\nmembers, a figure which probably would have\r\ncommanded general support, then in the eight years\r\nsince, 40 countries could have been members of the\r\nSecurity Council, in addition to the 40 which have\r\noccupied the 10 existing non-permanent seats. With the\r\nlack of any real prospect of agreement on the other\r\nreforms, the years keep passing, and with them our\r\ncountries keep being deprived of the opportunity to\r\ntake part in the work of the Security Council.\r\nIn any event, whatever option the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group chooses, Uruguay will continue to\r\nparticipate in efforts to reach agreement on all aspects\r\nof Council reform, and will do so in a flexible spirit,\r\nbut with one limitation: we cannot go along with any\r\nreform that is contrary to the fundamental principles of\r\nthis Organization through an extension to other States\r\nof existing privileges and inequalities.\r\nMs. Novotná (Slovakia): I begin by expressing\r\nmy gratitude to the former President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the leadership he\r\ndemonstrated on Security Council reform. I also thank\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nAmbassadors de Saram of Sri Lanka and Ingólfsson of\r\nIceland for their good work.\r\nThe Slovak Republic, like the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States, supports a Security Council\r\nreform that would enhance its representative character,\r\nimprove its working methods and the transparency of\r\nits work, and preserve the Council’s capability to act\r\npromptly. All of us undoubtedly know that the size of\r\nthe Council has remained unchanged for 37 years,\r\nwhereas the number of United Nations Member States\r\nhas risen during this period from 113 to 189.\r\nSecurity Council reform is urgently needed in\r\norder to strengthen confidence in the United Nations in\r\ngeneral, and in particular to enhance the perceived\r\nlegitimacy of the Council and its actions. A truly\r\neffective Security Council requires comprehensive\r\nreform. This is essential not least in order to strengthen\r\nthe Council’s ability to perform its role in preventive\r\ndiplomacy. In this regard, I would like to express my\r\ncountry’s views on both the role of the Council in the\r\ninternational system and its internal functioning.\r\nEffectiveness means that the decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council are respected and carried out. Reform\r\nshould ensure that a broad range of international\r\nconcerns is brought to the attention of the Security\r\nCouncil. It should ensure that important global and\r\nregional perspectives are included in the Council’s\r\ndecision-making process and that States take the\r\nresponsibility for its results. It should also ensure that\r\nthe Security Council acts, and is seen as acting, on\r\nbehalf of all Members of the United Nations.\r\nComprehensive Security Council reform, therefore, has\r\nto deal with the content of Council decisions, with its\r\nworking methods and with its size and composition.\r\nIt should be our goal that a global decision on\r\nSecurity Council enlargement — and it must be a\r\nglobal decision — takes regional views into account as\r\nmuch as possible. The members of the Security\r\nCouncil, permanent and non-permanent, share a global\r\nresponsibility. At the same time, all of them bring\r\nvaluable regional knowledge and experience to the\r\nCouncil. Balance and interaction between these global\r\nand regional factors is a key element in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. It should also be a major factor in the\r\nprocess of enlargement.\r\nWith regard to the issue of the enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council, Slovakia considers increasing the\r\nnumber of members in both categories to be the best\r\nway to make the Security Council correspond to the\r\nrealities of the international community. The failure to\r\nreach an agreement on enlargement in both categories\r\nshould not, however, necessarily preclude the\r\nendeavours to reach agreement on enlargement in at\r\nleast one category. The total number of the Council’s\r\nmembers should not exceed 25. The Slovak Republic is\r\nconvinced that a 25-member Council will be\r\nsufficiently representative and, at the same time, able\r\nto preserve its operational flexibility. We share what\r\nseems to be a clear majority view — namely, that it is\r\nimportant to reflect major changes in the international\r\nsystem in this way. The Group of Eastern European\r\nStates, whose membership has more than doubled over\r\nthe last 10 years, should not be omitted in the\r\nenlargement process of the Security Council.\r\nLet me address some of the crucial issues in\r\nmutual dependence where some improvement in the\r\nwork of the Security Council is needed. The credibility\r\nof the Security Council and the transparency of its\r\nwork are indeed related. Discussions and proposals\r\nfrom the Working Group have very clearly influenced\r\nthe tendency in the last few years towards a more open\r\nSecurity Council. Progress has been made, but more\r\nstill needs to be done. We realize fully the need for\r\nCouncil members to deliberate behind closed doors\r\nwhen specific situations so require, but we also expect\r\nsubstantial briefings to follow such meetings. Gradual\r\nimprovements in this regard have been duly noted.\r\nThe Security Council should continue to improve\r\nits practice with respect to regularly informing the non-\r\nmembers. The practice of open debates, the inclusion\r\nof affected non-members in its discussions and troop-\r\ncontributors’ meetings should be continued. Openness,\r\ntransparency and consultation are to a large extent a\r\nmatter of improving the practices and culture of the\r\nCouncil. This could also be reflected in the rules of\r\nprocedure, provided that enough flexibility is left for\r\nfurther development.\r\nThe new international situation has created fresh\r\nopportunities for unity in the Security Council and for\r\na cooperative approach to its decision-making. In this\r\nregard, Slovakia considers that the problem of the\r\nthreat of the veto remains the issue of central\r\nimportance. The Slovak Republic can accept the right\r\nof veto being extended to new permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council, but at the same time we would\r\nwant to see concerted action to reduce the role of the\r\nveto. The permanent members should be strongly\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nencouraged to minimize their use of it. They should\r\nnow be able to do what the General Assembly\r\nrequested 55 years ago: to agree among themselves on\r\nlimiting the number of situations in which the veto may\r\nbe used, and also to agree which issues should be\r\ndefined as procedural. And, as a part of the future\r\namendments of the Charter, the right to exercise the\r\nveto could perhaps be excluded for a number of\r\nspecific situations. The right of veto should be\r\nrestricted to decisions on matters taken under Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter. As regards the decision-making\r\nprocess, the Slovak Republic considers it possible in a\r\n25-member Council for decisions to be taken by a\r\nmajority of 15 votes.\r\nThe Council has already moved considerably\r\ntowards greater flexibility, and the use of the veto has\r\nbeen reduced. As the Security Council, hopefully,\r\ncontinues on this course of gradually limiting the use\r\nof the veto, it might also become less difficult to find a\r\nconsensus and make progress in the negotiations on\r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nFor those of us — and I believe that we are\r\nmany — who put our trust in the United Nations as the\r\nultimate guarantor of upholding peace and security, this\r\ndebate on essential changes leading to the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is very important. This is also the\r\nonly way in which the credibility of the Security\r\nCouncil can be improved. Our delegation is prepared to\r\nwork in a flexible manner in the Working Group\r\ntogether with other members of the United Nations on\r\nthis challenging task.\r\nMr. Pamir (Turkey): After many years of work,\r\nwe are at the beginning of yet another — and we hope\r\nmore fruitful — period of discussion on the\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects.\r\nLet me first recognize the contributions of the\r\nprevious President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Holkeri, as well as his Working Group Vice-\r\nChairmen, Ambassadors de Saram and Ingólffson.\r\nTurkey now looks forward to working with the\r\nPresident and his Vice-Chairmen during the coming\r\nmonths.\r\nSince the establishment of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group, Turkey, like many others, has been a\r\nstrong advocate of a comprehensive reform, which\r\nshould give the international community a more\r\neffective, cooperative, representative and transparent\r\nSecurity Council. There is no doubt that this reform is\r\nnecessary, and would, in the end, reflect the adaptation\r\nof this world body to the current realities of the\r\ninternational arena, which has changed so drastically\r\nduring the last decade.\r\nI reiterate Turkey’s firm commitment to a\r\ncomprehensive reform, encompassing all facets of the\r\nquestion. The Open-ended Working Group is, and\r\nshould remain, the only appropriate forum to examine\r\nin substance all the issues at hand. We believe that the\r\nprogress achieved so far is modest, and therefore call\r\nupon all members to commit themselves to the reform\r\nprocess with more dedication and the necessary\r\npolitical will. This would also be in conformity with\r\nthe call of our leaders at the Millennium Summit to\r\nintensify reform efforts.\r\nWe acknowledge that the right of veto played an\r\nimportant role in the past in sustaining global peace.\r\nNevertheless, its scope and use today are in dire need\r\nof reassessment. Moreover, during last year’s\r\ndeliberations it became evident once again that the veto\r\nis a central element in our entire discussion and\r\ninextricably linked to other issues of the reform\r\nprocess. However, insofar as those countries enjoying\r\nthis prerogative are not prepared to review in earnest\r\nits scope, we must work towards increasing the number\r\nof non-permanent seats, and thus not allow the issue of\r\nthe veto to preclude us from moving in the direction of\r\nreform.\r\nWe cannot emphasize enough how important it is\r\nto address the other issues waiting for reform as well.\r\nProgress on improving the working methods of the\r\nCouncil is still slow. During last year’s work we\r\nobserved a certain willingness on the part of some\r\nmembers of the Council to improve the existing\r\nworking methods, with a view to making its work more\r\ntransparent. In this context, I would like to mention\r\nparticularly the consultations with countries\r\ncontributing troops to peacekeeping operations, and\r\nimproved means of dialogue with the Council’s\r\nsecretariat.\r\nWe appreciate the interaction between the\r\nCouncil and the Working Group, and we hope that it\r\nwill intensify in the coming months. Yet, at the same\r\ntime, we believe that the modest steps taken by some\r\nCouncil members cannot be a substitute for a more\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Council and its more\r\neffective functioning.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nWith these thoughts in mind, Turkey looks\r\nforward to the next session of the Working Group and\r\nis convinced that under the President’s guidance it will\r\nbe able to make more progress.\r\nMr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme, first, to reiterate the thanks of France to the\r\nPresident’s predecessor, President Harri Holkeri, and to\r\nthe other members of the Bureau, who spared no effort\r\nto make more constructive and operational the debates\r\nin 2001 of the Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform. Their efforts contributed to deliberations on\r\nmatters whose sensitivity and complexity are\r\nappreciated by all.\r\nAs the President of the Republic indicated on\r\n7 September 2000 at the Security Council meeting held\r\nat the level of heads of State and Government, France\r\nsupports an enlargement of the Council in both\r\ncategories of membership — permanent and non-\r\npermanent.\r\nThat expansion must include developed countries\r\nand allow for better representation of developing\r\ncountries. France’s consistent position is guided by the\r\nneed to bear in mind the emergence of new powers and\r\nto enable the Security Council to continue to play its\r\nrole in full. It is therefore based on the idea of better\r\nrepresentativeness of the Security Council, while\r\npreserving the indispensable efficiency of its work.\r\nFrance is therefore prepared to consider an\r\nincrease of five permanent seats for two industrialized\r\ncountries and three developing States representing\r\nmajor regions of the world: Asia, Africa and Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. With respect to the\r\nenlargement of the Council, France believes that\r\nGermany, Japan and India could occupy permanent\r\nseats. France could also accept an increase of four non-\r\npermanent seats to be allocated respectively to the\r\nAfrican, Asian, Latin American and Caribbean and\r\nCentral and Eastern European Groups.\r\nWe are attached to the right of veto, as recognized\r\nby the Charter. Its use cannot be regulated or\r\nconstrained by pre-defined criteria. At the same time,\r\nFrance believes that the Security Council must be able\r\nfully to exercise the primary responsibility entrusted to\r\nit by the Charter, in particular in situations of serious\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law that\r\nthreaten international peace and security. For the\r\npermanent members, that would entail a responsible\r\nuse of their right of veto.\r\nFrance also attaches great importance to\r\nimproving the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil. Clear progress has been made in this area on\r\ntwo fronts: better cooperation and greater transparency.\r\nThe Council, engaged in numerous and increasingly\r\ncomplex peacekeeping operations, has been able to\r\ndevelop a dual partnership, first with troop-\r\ncontributing countries. In September, during its\r\npresidency of the Security Council, France was pleased\r\nto preside over the first implementation of resolution\r\n1353 (2001). Henceforth, the representatives of troop-\r\ncontributing countries can have genuine dialogue,\r\nwhenever desirable, with the representatives of the\r\nmembers of the Council. A partnership has also\r\nevolved with the representatives of financial and\r\ndevelopment organizations of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the Bretton Woods institutions in order to\r\nclearly define the actions of the Council and the\r\ncomplementary work undertaken by these agencies in\r\nthe field.\r\nWe must still give thought to a clear definition of\r\nthe responsibilities of the Security Council and those of\r\nthe General Assembly in the implementation of\r\noperations that incorporate peacekeeping and nation-\r\nbuilding or national reconstruction activities. I spoke\r\non this important question at length this morning with\r\nregard to East Timor, but of course it applies to all\r\nother missions of that nature.\r\nThe Council has also striven to work with greater\r\ntransparency. More public meetings are now being held\r\nand the daily summaries of consultations are being\r\nmade available more quickly. Thus, during its\r\npresidency last month, France daily summarized all the\r\nCouncil’s work on its Web site. Its monthly report was\r\nissued on the last day of September. Greater\r\ntransparency, however, may also mean involving the\r\nrepresentatives of countries directly concerned by a\r\nconflict more directly in the consultations on the issue.\r\nThis idea has been proposed and France believes that\r\nits immediate implementation could only be of great\r\nbenefit.\r\nThe reform of the composition and working\r\nmethods of the Security Council is an important\r\nobjective for France. We have no doubt that, under Mr.\r\nHan’s presidency, no effort will be spared to register\r\nprogress in the discussions of the Working Group.\r\nMr. Nejad Hosseinian (Islamic Republic of\r\nIran): Allow me to begin by expressing high\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nappreciation for the outstanding leadership and\r\npatience of the former Chairman and his two Vice-\r\nChairmen of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council for their\r\noutstanding work over the past year. We also trust that,\r\nunder Mr. Han’s skilful and able leadership, the\r\nWorking Group will explore all possible avenues and\r\nexhaust every possibility to fulfil its mandate.\r\nAs members of the General Assembly are aware,\r\ndespite the passage of eight years, the Working Group\r\nhas yet to agree upon such substantive matters as the\r\nsize and composition of the Security Council, and\r\nespecially on an increase in the permanent membership\r\nand the power of the veto. In other words, the\r\nfundamental question of how to advance from the\r\nSecurity Council that we have now to an organ that is\r\nmore representative and democratic, but no less\r\nefficient, has yet to be answered. As the debates in the\r\ncourse of the last and current sessions of the Working\r\nGroup testify, uphill efforts are still ahead.\r\nAt the same time, we need also to recall that\r\nsome considerable progress in the issues relating to the\r\nCouncil’s working methods, achieved in the course of\r\nsome previous sessions of the Working Group, could\r\nstill serve as a source of encouragement. Likewise,\r\nthere is no doubt that the deliberations in the Group\r\nover the past few years have to some extent positively\r\naffected the day-to-day work of the Council, leading it\r\nin the direction of increased accessibility and\r\ntransparency. However, it is unfortunate that the\r\nmomentum built up in this field could not be\r\nmaintained in the last session.\r\nOn the other hand, we believe that the impasse or\r\nlack of progress in the expansion of the permanent\r\nmembership of the Council, which continued during\r\nthe last session, should be viewed as a direct product of\r\nthe enormous importance of the issue and the diversity\r\nof views and interests. It proves that the same\r\nmechanism — the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nreform of the Security Council — with the same format\r\nand rules of procedure, is not yet exhausted and should\r\nbe given another chance.\r\nA considerable number of delegations, including\r\nmine, have been expressing frustration over the slow\r\nprogress — if not an impasse — in the work of the\r\nWorking Group. But we do not believe that we should\r\ncontemplate working out a way out of the current\r\nsituation by, for instance, relinquishing the basic\r\nprinciples that the great majority of the States Members\r\nof the United Nations have relentlessly endeavoured to\r\nuphold over the years. In other words, we believe that\r\nagreement on the reform of the Council should reflect\r\nthe legitimate objectives of the general membership of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nHere, it is worth reaffirming the fallback position\r\nmaintained by the Non-Aligned Movement, namely,\r\nthat if agreement is not reached on the expansion of the\r\npermanent membership, the expansion should be\r\nlimited, for the time being, to non-permanent seats.\r\nBecause of the importance of Council reform, we\r\nare of the view that, while respecting the principle of\r\nthe equality of all Member States, every effort should\r\nbe made to reach the broadest possible agreement\r\namong Member States. In other words, the interests of\r\nall States and regions should be seriously considered in\r\nthis unprecedented and historic exercise, which is at\r\nthe same time crucially important for the future of the\r\nUnited Nations and international relations. The process\r\nof reforming the Council, therefore, should not be\r\nsubject to any predetermined or superficial timetable.\r\nAny attempt to impose a premature, hasty decision\r\nwould run the risk of doing harm to this very delicate\r\nprocess, which is so important to all the States\r\nMembers of our Organization.\r\nWe believe that the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the reform of the Security Council — with the\r\ncurrent format and rules of procedure — continues to\r\nbe the appropriate forum in which to pursue efforts\r\naimed at reforming the work of the Council. It should\r\ntherefore be given an opportunity to carry out the\r\nmandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly.\r\nAs to the objectives of the reform of the Council,\r\nwe continue to believe that the goal of the process is,\r\nand must remain, to make the Council more\r\nrepresentative, more democratic, more transparent and\r\nmore accountable, thereby helping to strengthen its\r\nefficiency and increase its authority and that of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. It must therefore take into\r\naccount the dramatic changes which have taken place\r\nsince the creation of the United Nations 55 years ago,\r\nsuch as the end of the colonial era, which has resulted\r\nin the growing number of developing countries, and the\r\nend of the cold war. We believe that the attainment of\r\nthese objectives will require, among other reforms, the\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nexpansion of the membership of the Council to at least\r\n26, so that the developing world can be better\r\nrepresented.\r\nThe curtailment of the veto figures prominently\r\namong the minimum objectives sought by the general\r\nmembership of the United Nations over the years. It\r\nwould not be an exaggeration to say that there is a near\r\nconsensus on this issue. At their most recent summit\r\nmeeting, 114 members of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nagreed on the need for the curtailment of the veto, with\r\na view to its eventual elimination. Moreover, in last\r\nyear’s general debate in the General Assembly on the\r\nreform of the Security Council, about 95 out of 110\r\nspeakers who took part in the debate pronounced\r\nthemselves, in one way or another, in favour of the\r\ncurtailment or limitation of the veto.\r\nWe believe that a position so widely expressed\r\nand maintained cannot and should not be overlooked in\r\nthe course of our exercise. Furthermore, we believe\r\nthat disregard of the widespread call for the curtailment\r\nof the veto is not in the interests of the Security\r\nCouncil and will not contribute to making it more\r\ndemocratic and transparent or to enhancing the\r\nlegitimacy of its decisions.\r\nThe issue of the veto is a key element in the\r\nreform of the Council. It links both clusters under\r\nconsideration, and relates closely to the expansion of\r\nthe Council. We doubt that a vague commitment to\r\napply self-restraint in the exercise of the power of veto\r\nor to resort to it in a responsible manner could supplant\r\nits curtailment in a legally-binding way. Nor would it,\r\ntherefore, be an acceptable response to the aspirations\r\nof the vast majority of United Nations Member States.\r\nMr. Kasemsarn (Thailand): As I am speaking\r\nfrom this rostrum for the first time, I would like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I would like to add my voice to all\r\nthe delegates who have spoken before me on this very\r\nimportant agenda item on Security Council reform, in\r\nexpressing our deep appreciation for the perseverance\r\nand hard work of the outgoing Bureau of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council. I am confident that under the new\r\nleadership, the Open-ended Working Group will\r\ncontinue to make progress in implementing its daunting\r\ntask.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly will usher\r\nin the ninth year of deliberations on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council by the Open-ended Working Group.\r\nThe Thai delegation fully sympathizes with the\r\nWorking Group in view of the difficulties and\r\nchallenges that it faces. Because of the multifaceted\r\nnature of the issue of Security Council reform, and the\r\ninter-linkages between those facets, it would be wise to\r\ndeal with Security Council reform comprehensively,\r\nusing a package approach. That is why we have to\r\nattach equal importance to achieving progress —\r\nincremental as it may be — on both cluster I and\r\ncluster II issues.\r\nWithin cluster I, we are faced with three key\r\nissues, namely, the expansion of the Council; the\r\ndecision-making process of the Council; and the\r\nperiodic review of the enlarged Council. According to\r\nthe overwhelming majority of the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, the core issue is, without doubt, the\r\ndecision-making process of the Council and, with it,\r\nthe central question of the veto.\r\nThe exclusive character of the veto is anathema to\r\nany notion of democracy. In our view, the legitimacy of\r\nthe veto will be increasingly difficult to justify by the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council as we\r\nbuild a more democratic and more representative\r\nUnited Nations. We recognize that this will not happen\r\novernight. That is why we echo the call made by the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement for a gradual approach,\r\nbeginning with curtailment of the veto, and leading to\r\nits eventual abolition.\r\nIn this connection, indications by some\r\npermanent members of a political willingness to\r\nconstrain the use of the veto are encouraging signs. But\r\nthese indications should build towards, rather than\r\ndetract from, the ultimate goal of veto elimination. We\r\nhope that the five permanent members will recognize\r\nthat the entrustment to them of the veto by the\r\ninternational community more than 55 years ago\r\nimplies the need to exercise moral and political\r\nresponsibility in its use. We thus call on the five\r\npermanent members to take an important first step\r\nforward by pledging publicly to use the veto only with\r\nregard to actions under Chapter VII of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nGiven the increasing membership and diversity of\r\nthe United Nations body, the need to expand the\r\nSecurity Council is self-evident. In fact, the need to\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nexpand the Council is one of the few issues related to\r\nCouncil reform on which there is near-universal\r\nagreement. How, and to what extent, the expansion\r\nshould proceed have elicited many competing views, as\r\nenumerated in the report of the Working Group.\r\nThe proposed number of seats on an enlarged\r\nCouncil ranges from 20 to at least 30. Thailand favours\r\nthe mainstream approach: expansion in both the\r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories. Such\r\nexpansion should be based on two considerations:\r\nequitable geographical representation on the one hand,\r\nand the ability and readiness to share and to make\r\nfinancial and political contributions to the United\r\nNations on the other. On the basis of those criteria, we\r\nsee Japan as a worthy candidate to be a new permanent\r\nmember of the Council. Regarding the upper limit on\r\nthe size of the Council, we need to find a balance\r\nbetween ensuring the representative nature of that body\r\nand its need to work quickly, effectively and efficiently\r\nto resolve both old and new challenges to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn terms of expanding the Council, any solution\r\nagreed upon should be subject to periodic review in\r\nview of the increasingly dynamic nature of political\r\nand economic developments. That is because solutions\r\nthat may seem equitable and practical today may not be\r\nso 10 or even five years from now.\r\nIt should come as no surprise that most of the\r\nprogress in the deliberations on Security Council\r\nreform has come about on cluster II issues, which deal\r\nwith the working methods of the Council and the\r\ntransparency of its work. We have indeed witnessed a\r\ngreater willingness by the Security Council to interact\r\nmore frequently with the general membership of the\r\nUnited Nations. Within the context of the work of the\r\nWorking Group this year, we welcome the participation\r\nat one of the Group’s meetings — on 13 June — of\r\nrepresentatives of the Security Council. We hope that\r\nthis practice will be intensified and institutionalized in\r\ncoming years. We indeed welcome and appreciate the\r\nefforts by many Presidents of the Council to ensure a\r\ncontinuous flow of information between the Council\r\nand non-members. Moreover, we would like to\r\nencourage the Council to accept the involvement of\r\nnon-members directly concerned prior to or during the\r\ndeliberation of issues.\r\nThe importance of transparency and the need for\r\nclose interaction between the Council and the general\r\nUnited Nations membership cannot be better\r\nexemplified than by the formulation and\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001). While recognizing the prerogative of, and the\r\nneed for, the Council to act quickly and decisively to\r\nconfront the threat of international terrorism, we cannot\r\nbut feel that members of the international community\r\nshould have been able to make some important\r\ncontribution to strengthening that new framework for\r\ncooperation against international terrorism. The\r\nramifications of resolution 1373 (2001) for Member\r\nStates are tremendous, and yet they are unclear in some\r\naspects. The Council will need to work very closely\r\nwith the general United Nations membership to fine\r\ntune the evolving framework for cooperation to ensure\r\nits effectiveness and universality of its application. In\r\nthat connection, I commend the efforts of the United\r\nKingdom, as Chairman of the counter-terrorism\r\nCommittee, as well as the three Vice-Chairmen —\r\nColombia, Madagascar and the Russian Federation —\r\nto institute a continuous dialogue between the Council\r\nand the rest of the international community on that\r\nvery important matter.\r\nAs additional examples, I should like to highlight\r\nother two issues that have a great impact on the\r\ninternational community and on which we had hoped\r\nfor greater interaction between the general membership\r\nand the Security Council during the latter’s\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThe first is the issue of reform of the sanctions\r\nregimes of the Security Council. That issue is of great\r\ninterest because it not only affects international trade\r\nand investment but also involves the important issue of\r\nthe humanitarian consequences of sanctions. It also has\r\na direct bearing on our Charter responsibilities as third\r\nparties with regard to compliance with sanctions\r\nregimes. Surely, ideas and perspectives from the\r\ngeneral membership of the United Nations would have\r\nbeen useful to the Security Council’s deliberations on\r\nthe matter. Thailand wishes to see continued efforts by\r\nthe international community to develop targeted\r\nsanctions and endeavours by the Council to improve\r\nthe international monitoring of sanctions regimes and\r\nto assess the humanitarian impact of sanctions.\r\nThe second issue is that of peacekeeping. As a\r\ntroop-contributing country that is currently\r\ncontributing a sizeable force to the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor, as well as\r\nits Force Commander, Thailand appreciates and would\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nlike to commend the enhanced interaction between the\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries, which is\r\neffective and continuous.\r\nFinally, there is no substitute for strong political\r\nwill, by each and every one of us, as the key ingredient\r\nfor progress on the reform of the Security Council.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit last year, the\r\ninternational community expressed its political will for\r\nreform. What is needed now is our strong political will\r\nto take the work forward. It is my hope that by the\r\ntenth anniversary of the operation of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group, we will be witness to a reformed\r\nSecurity Council that is more representative but whose\r\neffectiveness in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity has not been impaired.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): Once again,\r\nGhana welcomes the opportunity to participate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s consideration of agenda item 49,\r\nwhich deals with a matter of cardinal importance to the\r\nlong-term development and effectiveness of the United\r\nNations in its aspiration to ensure global peace and\r\nsecurity. I wish to thank His Excellency Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri of Finland, President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-fifth session, and Ambassadors John de\r\nSaram of Sri Lanka and Thorsteinn Ingólfsson of\r\nIceland for their leadership and assiduous work in\r\nguiding the discussions in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform over the past year.\r\nThe debate and the issues involved are not new and\r\nhave gone on for the past eight years as the Working\r\nGroup has continued to grapple with disparate\r\nproposals on the underlying principles, nature and\r\nscope of reform.\r\nWe must acknowledge that the process has been\r\nslow and laborious, and sometimes frustrating and\r\ndisheartening. What is not in doubt is the convergence\r\nof views on the need for comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council to make it more democratic,\r\ntransparent and in conformity with current global\r\npolitical configuration. Our slow progress is a\r\nreflection of a substantial divergence of views on key\r\nissues such as the size of the increase, the use of the\r\nveto, improvements in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil, and the need for periodic review. That\r\nsituation is all the more regrettable because the most\r\npersistent advocates of democratic governance,\r\naccountability and transparency in decision-making at\r\nthe national level do not seem, on the international\r\nplane, wedded to those same principles, which\r\nunderline the issue of reforms of the Council.\r\nGhana has stressed time and again that the needs\r\nand the challenging responsibilities that the\r\nOrganization faces — issues of peace and security,\r\ndevelopment, poverty alleviation, the dimensions of\r\nglobalization, humanitarian intervention and its\r\nimplications for contemporary international law, the\r\nconcept of good governance and, now, international\r\nterrorism — require the active support and cooperation\r\nof all Member States, irrespective of size.\r\nThe recent terrorist attacks in the United States\r\nhave been soundly condemned. They have ushered in a\r\nnew spirit of cooperation, coalition and collectivity that\r\nwill bode well for multilateralism if we allow the same\r\nspirit and enthusiasm to pervade all aspects of the work\r\nof the United Nations. The Council itself has\r\ndemonstrated recognition of that approach through the\r\nspeed with which it is spearheading the Organization’s\r\nagenda on countering terrorism at all levels. My\r\ndelegation hopes that the Council, particularly its\r\npermanent members, will demonstrate a similar\r\ncommitment to the process of discussion at the level of\r\nthe Working Group on Security Council reform.\r\nGhana wishes to stress, as it has done in previous\r\nstatements, the need to enhance the credibility of the\r\nCouncil through substantive reform which is guided by\r\nthe principles of democracy, the sovereign equality of\r\nStates and equitable geographical representation. A\r\nreformed Security Council should be transparent in its\r\nactivities and more responsive to the interests of the\r\ngeneral membership in matters deriving from its\r\nmandate under the Charter — the more so as all\r\nMembers of the United Nations are called upon to\r\nshare the burden of the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security through, inter alia, assessed\r\ncontributions to the peacekeeping budget and provision\r\nof troops for United Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, Ghana continues to\r\nsubscribe to the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement on all aspects of the question of an increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council,\r\ncomplemented by the African position, as expressed in\r\nthe Harare Declaration of June 1997. Africa’s claim to\r\nat least two permanent seats should be adequately\r\naddressed, since Africa is the largest regional group in\r\nthe Organization.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nThe new spirit of cooperation and collectivism\r\nthat is beginning to characterize multilateral diplomacy\r\nreflects a trend that augurs well for our active and\r\npositive consideration of this subject. It is only in this\r\nway that we can translate into reality the resolve of our\r\nheads of State and Government in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration to, inter alia, intensify efforts to achieve\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. Any piecemeal and ad hoc approach to the\r\nreform process would thus be a betrayal of the\r\nintentions of our political leaders.\r\nMr. Kmoníček (Czech Republic): The\r\nrepresentative of Belgium yesterday presented the joint\r\nposition of the Group of Ten on issues related to\r\nenlargement and reform of the Security Council, and he\r\nalso spoke on behalf of my delegation. This allows me\r\nto be very short.\r\nThe response by the international community to\r\nthe terrorist attack was immediate and firm, and in that\r\nresponse the Members of the United Nations were\r\nmore unified than ever before. The prestige of the\r\nCouncil in this historic moment grew, but so did its\r\nresponsibility and, in a way, the scope of its action.\r\nIndeed, our very understanding of security has been\r\nmodified. The overall message is clear: as international\r\nsecurity vis-à-vis globalized crime calls for broader\r\ncoalitions, for collective action by as many States as\r\npossible, the need for a truly representative Council\r\nbecomes more urgent. The Council should be enlarged,\r\nand its working methods should be improved.\r\nTogether with many other countries, the Czech\r\nRepublic has been pushing the reform agenda through\r\nthe years of protracted debates in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group or in this plenary. We are of the\r\nopinion that there exist enough reform proposals from\r\nwhich to choose. Our own choice is what we believe is\r\nin the realistic mainstream of the reform.\r\nWe believe that the Security Council should be\r\nenlarged in both categories, preferably with five\r\nadditional permanent seats and four to five additional\r\nnon-permanent seats, including one for Eastern Europe.\r\nWe respect the option of rotating permanent seats for\r\nspecific regions, but no country or region should be\r\nforced into such a scheme.\r\nWe continue to favour some reduction in the areas\r\nwhere the veto can be applied, possibly through\r\nindividual commitments by permanent members and\r\nother steps which do not necessarily require Charter\r\namendments.\r\nIn the area of Security Council working methods,\r\nwe generally welcome and support any reasonable\r\nmotion towards greater openness and transparency in\r\nthe Council’s work.\r\nI am confining myself to these brief comments.\r\nThere is little need to elaborate the details of the\r\nproposals before mobilizing the political will and\r\nenvironment conducive to reform. Let me express my\r\nhope that the newly found unity in action against\r\nterrorism will help to generate such a momentum, and\r\nthat this will soon be mirrored in greater unity in our\r\nreform efforts. In this, the guidance of the President\r\nwill be crucial.\r\nMr. Kim Chang Guk (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): My delegation has noted with\r\ngreat attention the report submitted by the Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform and would like to\r\npresent its views on this issue.\r\nProposals to increase membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and thus ensure equitable representation by all\r\nregions constitute an essential part of the deliberations\r\non Council reform. They are also part and parcel of the\r\nmovement to democratize the United Nations as a\r\nwhole.\r\nWe are of the view that it is important, above all,\r\nto have a correct concept of the purpose of Security\r\nCouncil reform in order to further proceed with reform\r\nin a proper way. Ensuring equitable representation in\r\nthe Security Council undoubtedly means an increase in\r\nthe number of developing countries in its membership.\r\nHowever, the present debates on reform give rise to\r\nconcern as to whether reform of the Council would be\r\ncarried out in conformity with its intrinsic purpose.\r\nThe need for reform is recognized by all Member\r\nStates, but we have noticed some goals being pursued\r\nthat stray from the purpose of reform. Certain countries\r\nare interested in decreasing their financial burdens\r\nwhile preserving their privileges, and some others are\r\ntrying to gain a privileged position by waving the\r\nmoney purse without having any political\r\nqualifications. If these erroneous purposes keep being\r\npursued in disregard of the intrinsic purpose of Council\r\nreform, reform will not be achieved for a long time\r\nand, even when carried out, will make no contribution\r\nto the establishment of a fair international order.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nIt is a prerequisite for proper reform of the\r\nSecurity Council that all matters be settled by\r\nconsensus through full negotiations by all Member\r\nStates. Any pressure or arbitrary action should not be\r\ntolerated in the discussion of reform issues. If we\r\ncannot agree on all issues at one time, we can start one\r\nby one with the issues that can be easily agreed. And\r\nreform of the Security Council, as it is only one part of\r\noverall United Nations reforms, should be addressed in\r\nthe context of the increased power of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nA main point in the issue of enlarging the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council is an increase in\r\nthe representation of developing countries. Since the\r\ncomposition of the Council, which was formed on the\r\nbasis of the United Nations membership 40 years ago,\r\nremains intact and more than 70 developing countries\r\nhave joined the Organization since then, it cannot\r\nreflect the reality. In light of this, my delegation holds\r\nthat developing countries would be fully represented in\r\nthe Security Council if the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers were to be increased.\r\nWe consider it appropriate that increasing the\r\nnumber of non-permanent and permanent members be\r\ndiscussed separately and that enlargement of non-\r\npermanent membership be given priority. My\r\ndelegation also holds that greater prudence should be\r\nexercised with regard to the enlargement of the\r\npermanent membership. Enlargement of Council does\r\nnot necessarily require more permanent members.\r\nWe must consider very carefully if enlarging the\r\npermanent membership would really help to\r\ndemocratize the United Nations and enhance the\r\neffectiveness of the Security Council, or, rather, if it\r\nmight not bring about the opposite result. Furthermore,\r\nif enlargement of the permanent membership is agreed,\r\npriority must be given to the developing countries.\r\nHowever, to submit the candidature of an\r\nindividual country as a new permanent member, before\r\nany agreement on the enlargement of the permanent\r\nmembership has been reached, is tantamount to putting\r\nthe cart before the horse. Furthermore, it is not in line\r\nwith the lofty objectives of Security Council reform to\r\nconsider for permanent membership in the Council a\r\ncountry that has not yet made amends for its past\r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nMy delegation hopes that discussion of this item\r\nwill serve to democratize the Security Council and\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations, in\r\nconformity with the legitimate demands and aspirations\r\nof the majority of Member States.\r\nMr. Bakoniarivo (Madagascar) (spoke in\r\nFrench): May I first pay tribute to Mr. Han’s\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, Chairman of the\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Security Council,\r\nand to the two Vice-Chairmen, the Ambassadors of Sri\r\nLanka and Iceland, for the sustained efforts they have\r\nmade to advance our work on this question during the\r\npast session.\r\nThe report submitted to us is a good reflection not\r\nonly of the results of their personal efforts but also of\r\nthe contributions of Member States to ensuring the\r\nprogress of the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe deliberations of the Working Group over the\r\npast eight years have demonstrated the importance of\r\nreforming the Security Council in order to make it\r\nmore effective and better able to meet the growing\r\nchallenges of our century. The climate of uncertainty\r\nnow prevailing in international relations is making it\r\nmore urgent than ever to undertake a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Council, which is the primary organ\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nLike other delegations, Madagascar cannot\r\nconceal its concern at the little progress achieved in the\r\nprocess that has been under way these past years. It is\r\nall the more regrettable that the momentum conferred\r\nby the Millennium Summit and supported by the\r\nGeneral Assembly has not led to any significant\r\nadvances, notwithstanding the appeal contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration for additional efforts to be\r\nmade in order to bring about a global reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIt is therefore not surprising that such a situation\r\nshould give rise to weariness and scepticism as to the\r\nprospect of continuing further along this road.\r\nNevertheless, we feel that, despite the continuing\r\ndifficulties, reform is indispensable if we really wish to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of the Council, as Member\r\nStates so ardently wish to do. Furthermore, it is\r\nundeniable that the Security Council can gain credence\r\nand win the confidence of the international community\r\nonly if it becomes more representative, democratic,\r\ntransparent and accountable.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nIt is widely recognized that currently the structure\r\nand composition of the Council do not reflect the\r\npolitical, economic and demographic realities of our\r\ntime. Despite the changes that have occurred in the\r\nglobal configuration, the permanent members have\r\nremained the same, with all of the privileges attached\r\nto that status. Developing countries, which represent a\r\nmajority in the new global landscape, have become\r\nmarginalized and must simply accept the decisions\r\ntaken by the small Security Council club.\r\nThis anomaly must be done away with through an\r\nenlargement of the Security Council in both categories\r\nof seats — permanent and non-permanent — on the\r\nbasis of equitable geographical distribution and in the\r\nframework of an adequate balance between North and\r\nSouth and between developing and industrialized\r\ncountries. Africa, which represents one quarter of the\r\nmembership, must have at least two additional\r\npermanent and two additional non-permanent seats in a\r\nreformed Security Council.\r\nMadagascar welcomes the fact that there is\r\ngeneral agreement on the idea of enlarging the Council,\r\nbut deplores the absence of consensus on practical\r\narrangements for bringing it about. My delegation\r\nentertains the hope that, in the course of this session,\r\nthe Working Group will find some common ground\r\nupon which agreement could be reached on this\r\nfundamental aspect of the reform.\r\nTurning now to the right of veto, the debate that\r\nhas been held on this subject, both in the Working\r\nGroup and in plenary, has shown that a great majority\r\nof States consider the veto to be an anachronistic and\r\ndiscriminatory right and that therefore its scope should\r\nbe limited, with a view to its elimination. Exercised in\r\nbreach of the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates and of the principle of democracy, the right of\r\nveto should no longer have any place in a Security\r\nCouncil that is seeking effectiveness and legitimacy.\r\nEfforts to reform the Council should therefore\r\nlead to the abolition of the veto right, without which no\r\nchange can be meaningful. Pending the elimination of\r\nthe right of veto, its use should be limited to Chapter\r\nVII of the Charter. In this context, it is essential to\r\nenvisage the possibility of the General Assembly’s\r\nrequiring explanations as to the way in which use is\r\nmade of the veto in certain cases, in order to avoid\r\nabuse of the veto.\r\nBearing in mind the political considerations that\r\nare intrinsic to the right of veto, my delegation\r\nsupports the idea of holding a substantive debate on\r\nthis question with the permanent members, so as to\r\nfind, in concert with them, formulas that could help us\r\nto break the current deadlock.\r\nAs other delegations have noted, transparency is\r\nan important measure in innovations to the Council’s\r\nworking methods. On this subject, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the efforts undertaken by the members of the\r\nCouncil to increase the number of open meetings, even\r\nthough they are still fewer in number than the closed\r\nmeetings. My delegation hopes that the Security\r\nCouncil will maintain this timely trend towards\r\nopenness in order to enhance the transparency of its\r\nwork.\r\nGiven the collective and shared responsibility of\r\nall Member States in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, my delegation considers that the\r\nCouncil’s debates are effective only to the extent that\r\nthey afford an opportunity for interaction between that\r\nbody and States that are not members of the Council. It\r\nis in that spirit that my delegation would have wished\r\nfor a more open debate in the process of adopting\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which addresses a subject of\r\nvital importance to the international community. The\r\nimplementation of that resolution requires the\r\ncollaboration of all Member States.\r\nSecurity Council reform affects the vital interests\r\nof all Member States and plays a crucial role in the\r\nfuture development of the United Nations. For this\r\nreason, the continuation of efforts to arrive at a final\r\nagreement on the totality of measures envisaged for\r\nreforming the Council has become an urgent task that\r\nwe cannot postpone and a moral duty that we must not\r\nshirk.\r\nWe have confidence that under President Han’s\r\nguidance, the Working Group will prove equal to the\r\nmission that has been entrusted to it, ensuring that a\r\nspirit of compromise and cooperation prevails. The\r\nfuture of our Organization and of humankind are at\r\nstake.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): At the outset, I wish to\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, former Chairman of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters related to the Security\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nCouncil, and to the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and\r\nIceland, Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group, for\r\ntheir tireless efforts to move forward the discussions on\r\nCouncil reform.\r\nHow to move forward the discussions we started\r\non this issue in 1993 is the most pertinent question of\r\nthe day. This is the question that many delegations are\r\nasking and, may I say, with justification. We find it\r\nfrustrating that we are still faced with a stalemate,\r\nespecially after we have spent so much time, energy\r\nand effort for many years to reach general agreement\r\non a final package for submission to the General\r\nAssembly. For many, this frustration has given rise to\r\ndwindling interest in the issue of Council reform. As\r\nmany delegations have rightly assessed, the present\r\nstalemate is the result of the lack of necessary political\r\nwill and of leadership on the part of the most\r\nresponsible members of the Security Council. It is our\r\nbelief that without that leadership, it will not be\r\npossible to move Council reform forward. We are\r\ngreatly concerned that this stalemate will undermine\r\nconfidence in the Security Council, the organ primarily\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is not a mere\r\nrestructuring of an organ. It goes far beyond that. It\r\nalso represents the most fundamental question in\r\ninternational relations. As the Secretary-General has\r\naptly remarked in his Millennium Report, the present\r\ncomposition of the Council does not fully represent\r\neither the character or the needs of our globalized\r\nworld. Therefore, a continued stalemate would\r\nperpetuate the anomalous situation of the Council in\r\nthe complex and difficult international situation which\r\nwe face today.\r\nWhen the Foreign Ministers of the 10 member\r\ncountries of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) met in Hanoi in July this year, they\r\nemphasized the need to strengthen the\r\nrepresentativeness, effectiveness, transparency and\r\naccountability of the Council through our efforts to\r\nreform it. As today’s world situation clearly\r\ndemonstrates, the Council needs to enhance these\r\nqualities to be able to deal with the new and complex\r\nissues of peace and security.\r\nConcerning its representativeness, there is no\r\ndenying that a membership of 15 countries could not\r\nadequately represent the 189 countries of the\r\nOrganization. However hard we may try to observe\r\nscrupulously the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution in electing new non-permanent members of\r\nthe Council, the small membership leaves many\r\nregions and subregions either underrepresented or\r\nwholly unrepresented.\r\nIt is therefore generally agreed that the Council\r\nmust be expanded in both the permanent and non-\r\npermanent categories of membership to enhance its\r\nrepresentative character. Given this general agreement,\r\nthe immediate and most important question, deserving\r\nour urgent attention, is, in my delegation’s view, the\r\noverall size of the new Council and its corollary issues\r\nof how many new seats should be created and which\r\ncountries should fill these new seats. Because of its\r\nlinkage to the distribution of new permanent and non-\r\npermanent members among regions, the question of\r\nsize must be addressed as a matter of top priority if we\r\nwish to see forward movement in our now-stalled\r\ndiscussions. Although there are divergent positions on\r\nthe total size of the enlarged Council, we hope that\r\nsome flexibility on all sides will enable us to arrive at a\r\nrealistic figure that is both representative and effective.\r\nWe consider that an agreement on size would certainly\r\nfacilitate our next stage of discussions on how to\r\ndistribute the new seats among regions. Therefore,\r\nthere is a strong case for focusing our new attempts on\r\nthis core issue.\r\nWith regard to the effectiveness and transparency\r\nof the Council, it is encouraging that some progress has\r\nbeen made on the question of the working methods of\r\nthe Council. We are also pleased to note that that\r\nprogress has been reflected in the actual practices of\r\nthe Council and that some useful proposals have been\r\ntaken up by the Council. These are welcome\r\ndevelopments.\r\nWe are of the view that we should seek ways and\r\nmeans to institutionalize the suggestions that have been\r\nsubmitted to make the work of the Council effective\r\nand transparent. We are also of the view that further\r\nimprovement in the Council’s working methods and its\r\ngreater openness to the general membership would\r\nmake our discussions on Council reform a worthwhile\r\nexercise. This would also send to the international\r\ncommunity the important message that our sustained\r\nefforts to modernize the Council have paid off in\r\nregard to certain aspects.\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nThe Security Council derives its mandate from\r\nthe general membership of the Organization, which\r\nagrees to fulfil any obligation that stems from a\r\ndecision taken by the Security Council. The\r\neffectiveness of the Council in its cardinal task\r\ntherefore depends on the full and willing\r\nimplementation of the relevant decisions by the\r\nMembers of the Organization. The division of\r\nobligations between the Council and non-members of\r\nthe Council, as provided for in the Charter, requires the\r\nSecurity Council to fulfil its part of the obligations.\r\nThese include being alert to the threat to international\r\npeace and security; taking necessary measures in\r\naccordance with Charter provisions; ensuring that\r\ndecisions adopted are fully implemented; and, last but\r\nnot least, being accountable to the general membership,\r\nwhich in fact is the source of the enormous powers\r\nvested in the Council.\r\nAs for the accountability of the Council there is\r\nstill much room for improvement although the annual\r\nreporting mechanism, the resort to more presidential\r\nbriefings of non-members of the Council and the\r\nholding of more open meetings served as useful\r\ndevices to account for what the Council has done on\r\nour behalf under Article 24 of the Charter. The\r\nCouncil’s accountability would be much enhanced if\r\nmore formal channels could be established between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, other than the stop-\r\ngap measures being taken to assuage our concern to\r\nknow more about the Council’s work. In this respect,\r\nspecial reporting on issues of particular concern to our\r\nmembers could be an effective device, although that\r\nwould mean an extra burden on the Council’s already\r\nheavy agenda. However, such a mechanism would\r\ngreatly strengthen confidence in the Council.\r\nIt is the general feeling that, due to the continued\r\nstalemate, the momentum that we have created over the\r\nlast several years has been lost. Given that the great\r\nmajority of Member States wish to see the early\r\nrealization of Security Council reform, as reaffirmed at\r\nthe Millennium Summit, it is vitally important to\r\nrekindle the interest of Member States in the issue of\r\nCouncil reform. One way of doing this is to explore\r\nhow to give effect to many worthwhile proposals on\r\nthe table while we attempt to arrive at a Council size\r\nacceptable to all, including the permanent members.\r\nWe believe that this parallel approach will have the\r\nbenefit of achieving something tangible from our years\r\nof discussions in the event that no progress is possible\r\non the expansion question.\r\nAt a time when economic and political processes\r\nall over the world are being liberalized and\r\ndemocratized, the Security Council cannot maintain its\r\nstatus quo. Its continued relevance and legitimacy will\r\nnot stand if its composition and powers are not\r\ncompatible with the changes of the time and the ideals\r\nof democracy. As we stated last year, our success in the\r\nreform of the Council will be tantamount to the\r\ngenuine democratization of the United Nations. Despite\r\nthe fact that we appreciate the achievements made in\r\nour endeavour to reform the United Nations, this\r\nsuccess will not be genuine if we cannot resolve the\r\nexpansion question. The resolution of this question will\r\nbe possible only if we focus on the issue of the size of\r\nthe Council and show a spirit of accommodation in our\r\nnew attempts at progress in our future discussions. In a\r\nspirit of accommodation, my delegation will continue\r\nto cooperate with other delegations to achieve as much\r\nsuccess as possible in our common efforts. The absence\r\nof discernible success in this important task of the\r\nUnited Nations could do great damage to the credibility\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nMs. Ognjanovac (Croatia): This topic has been\r\non our agenda for eight years now. During all these\r\nyears we have all been aware that the fundamental\r\nchanges in international relations aware since the\r\nfounding of the United Nations, more than 50 years\r\nago, require corresponding change in the composition\r\nand work of the Security Council. Although many of us\r\nwere ready to undertake certain steps in that direction,\r\nsome, remained reluctant.\r\nAlthough we have been discussing this matter for\r\nso long, there still remain many differences amongst\r\nus. At the same time, valuable work has already been\r\ndone, and we believe that we should continue to build\r\non it. In this regard, let me pay tribute to the\r\ncontribution towards reform made by the President’s\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, and his two Working\r\nGroup Vice-Chairmen, Ambassadors de Saram and\r\nIngólfsson. We look forward to working with the\r\nPresident and his Vice-Chairmen during the coming\r\nyear. However, we are aware that visible progress\r\ncannot be achieved without the clear political will of\r\nall Member States. We are therefore of the opinion that\r\nwe should not exclude the idea of moving this process\r\nto a higher political level at the appropriate time.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nThe Croatian position is very well known, and\r\ntherefore I will reiterate just its main outline. We hold\r\nthat the Council must be enlarged in both categories of\r\nmembership to reflect changes in international affairs.\r\nIn this regard, we support the creation of five new\r\npermanent seats, of which two should be allocated to\r\nthe industrialized countries and three to developing\r\ncountries. Regarding the possible rotation of these\r\nposts, we believe that it is up to the regions to decide\r\nabout such an arrangement, with the consent of each\r\nMember State in question. On the question of non-\r\npermanent seats, we support the idea of increasing\r\nthem by four seats, with one each allocated to the\r\nAfrican, Asian and Latin American and Caribbean\r\nregions, and one to the Eastern European region. In this\r\nway, we support increasing Council membership to a\r\nmaximum of 24 seats.\r\nWith regard to the veto, we favour its abolition,\r\nas do a number of other Member States, arguing that it\r\nis not a democratic method of decision-making.\r\nHowever, if political realities will not allow the\r\nnegotiations to go in this direction, we would support a\r\nreduction of the power of the veto and the use of the\r\nso-called double veto.\r\nWe all agree that the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council should be more transparent and\r\nfurther democratized. We commend the latest\r\nendeavours by some Security Council Presidents to\r\nhold regular exchanges of views with non-members\r\nregarding topics discussed in the Security Council, a\r\ngood example being the meetings with troop\r\ncontributors to peacekeeping missions. Even so, there\r\nis much more to be done, not just in the area of\r\ntransparency and improving the working methods of\r\nthe Security Council, but in improving coordination of\r\nthe work of all the main bodies of the United Nations\r\nbased on the new, multifaceted approach to\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nToday, following the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember, when we are all united in the common fight\r\nagainst terrorism, we should use this positive spirit of\r\ntogetherness and respect for our Organization as a\r\nglobal leader to strive to achieve our goal of moving\r\nthe process of Security Council reform forward. The\r\nNobel Prize awarded to our Organization demonstrates\r\nthat we are on the right path, and should give us added\r\nimpetus to complete the unfinished agenda before us.\r\nMr. Nacerodien (South Africa): We would like to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the President’s predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, whose unwavering commitment to\r\nthe work of the Working Group was exemplary. We\r\nthank him, the Vice-Chairmen and the Bureau for\r\nmaking every effort to ensure that the Working Group\r\nremains true to its mandate.\r\nThe report before us is testimony to the efforts\r\nmade to address all the issues related to Security\r\nCouncil reform. However, the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup remains deadlocked on key issues. Even more\r\ndisconcerting is the fact that the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup was again unable to properly engage on issues\r\nsuch as the veto or the final size of an expanded\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThis Assembly adopted resolution 48/26 on 3\r\nDecember 1993 in recognition of the need to review\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\nmatters. It did so because the substantial increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations, especially in terms\r\nof developing countries, as well as the changes in\r\ninternational relations, necessitated a review of the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation realizes that any final decision on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council will have to take\r\nplace at the highest political level. However, such a\r\ndecision is meant to emanate from the technical\r\ndeliberations and recommendations of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group.\r\nIn practice, the ongoing stalemate has meant that\r\nmany Member States, particularly from developing\r\ncountries, are unable to justify continued participation\r\nin the Open-ended Working Group. Surely, we cannot\r\nhave a Working Group that will eventually mirror the\r\nbody it is trying to reform — an unrepresentative club\r\npresiding over and deciding on matters of importance\r\nto us all.\r\nWe are convinced that the lack of participation by\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries, is\r\nnot due to a lack of interest in, or diminished\r\nimportance attributed to, Council reform. To the\r\ncontrary, on those occasions when permanent members\r\nof the Security Council have demonstrated some\r\nflexibility, discussions in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup have been lively and well attended. The\r\nassumption can therefore be made that delegations\r\nfrom developing countries would be more willing to\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.35\r\nparticipate in the Open-ended Working Group if they\r\nanticipated some concrete progress in its deliberations.\r\nAt the Millennium Assembly our political leaders\r\nstated that the\r\n“Responsibility for managing worldwide\r\neconomic and social development, as well as\r\nthreats to international peace and security, must\r\nbe shared among the nations of the world and\r\nshould be exercised multilaterally.” (resolution\r\n55/2, para. 6)\r\nIn order to translate these shared values into actions,\r\nthe Summit identified key objectives to which they\r\nassigned special significance, including to “intensify\r\nour efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects.” (ibid., para. 30)\r\nWhen set against this overwhelming expression\r\nof the need to reform the Security Council made just\r\none year ago, the ongoing stalemate leads one to the\r\nconclusion that the Open-ended Working Group is in\r\ndanger of losing its credibility.\r\nIn our view, the General Assembly should not\r\nmerely mandate the Open-ended Working Group to\r\ncontinue with business as usual. Neither would it be\r\nproductive to review the Open-ended Working Group’s\r\ncurrent mandate and working methods, as this would\r\nmost likely result in an unproductive debate on\r\nreforming the Open-ended Working Group and not the\r\nCouncil.\r\nAt the concluding plenary meeting of the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly, the President of\r\nthe General Assembly and Chairman of the Open-\r\nended Working Group, Mr. Harri Holkeri, noted that\r\nmany Foreign Ministers had responded to his request\r\nfor assistance on ways to intensify efforts to reform the\r\nSecurity Council, as called for in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. He observed that many Ministers\r\nacknowledged that the Open-ended Working Group had\r\nworked well as an initial discussion forum, but that the\r\ntime had perhaps come to consider other avenues to\r\nadvance the process.\r\nMr. Holkeri also made the important point that in\r\norder to resolve the stalemate and maintain the impetus\r\nof the Millennium Summit, Member States should\r\nmove from discussions into negotiations. Again it is\r\nclear that the issue needs to be taken to a higher\r\npolitical level, because the technical experts in the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group are apparently not able to\r\nfulfil the task of negotiating Security Council reform.\r\nIf we are to achieve measurable results, South\r\nAfrica believes that the next session of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group should be devoted to ensuring that the\r\ntechnical work of the Open-ended Working Group is\r\nbrought into step with the political will expressed by\r\nour leaders in the Millennium Summit. Since it appears\r\nthat the Open-ended Working Group is unable to\r\nachieve this on its own, then clearly it is now time to\r\nestablish the high-level political dialogue proposed by\r\nMr. Holkeri in order to take the process forward.\r\nWe look forward to cooperating with President\r\nHan, in the coming session on this important work.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nattention of the General Assembly to document\r\nA/INF/56/3/Add.1, which covers the period from 5\r\nNovember through 11 December 2001, and which has\r\nbeen distributed to Member States in the Hall this\r\nafternoon. The lists of speakers for the items\r\nmentioned in document A/INF/56/3/Add.1 are open.\r\nThe General Assembly in due course will be kept\r\ninformed of the dates for the consideration of other\r\nagenda items as well as of any additions or changes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.\r\n"
