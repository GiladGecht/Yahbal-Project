(Republic of Korea)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Botnaru\r\n(Republic of Moldova), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 49 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Niculescu (Romania): Mr. Vice-President, it\r\nis a pleasure to see you presiding over this meeting. I\r\nwould like to start my intervention by paying tribute to\r\nthe contribution to this reform debate made by the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, and his two Vice-Chairmen in the Working\r\nGroup, Ambassadors de Saram and Ingólffson. Mr.\r\nHolkeri’s proposals on Security Council reform, put\r\nforward in his statement at the concluding meeting of\r\nthe previous session of General Assembly, remain\r\nimportant guidelines for our future activities. At the\r\nsame time, allow me to thank President Han, through\r\nyou, for calling this timely debate on agenda item 49\r\nand to assure him that we are looking forward to\r\nsupporting him and both Vice-Chairmen during the\r\ncoming year.\r\nThe dramatic events of 11 September and the\r\nprompt answer that the international community is\r\ngiving to them demonstrate once again the crucial role\r\nplayed by the United Nations in general, and by the\r\nSecurity Council in particular, in the fight against\r\nterrorism, the most dangerous threat nowadays to\r\nglobal peace and stability. The immediate adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and the\r\nestablishment of the Security Council Committee on\r\nCounter-Terrorism speak for themselves.\r\nNevertheless, the recent vivid, and mostly\r\ncritical, debate in this Assembly on the Security\r\nCouncil’s annual report clearly shows that the reform\r\nof that principal body of the Organization is more\r\nnecessary than ever, and that the time has come to take\r\nquick and concrete steps in this matter. We should\r\nleave behind time-consuming debates over nuances in\r\nlanguage, and instead move forward by seriously\r\nanalysing the existing models of an expanded and more\r\neffective Council. With due respect to the committed\r\nactivities of our Group and to the importance of the\r\nmore general debates on this issue which are taking\r\nplace in both the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil, we realize that bringing the debates up to the\r\nlevel of the political leadership of our countries — at\r\nleast, on the most controversial issues — might be the\r\nonly productive way to overcome the current\r\ndifficulties.\r\nRomania, like a significant majority of Member\r\nStates, supports the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil in both categories of membership, in order to\r\nreflect changed global realities. We share the view that\r\nsuch an increase should strike a balance between\r\nenhancing the opportunities for participation and\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the Council. Our choice is\r\nfor an additional five permanent seats, for both\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\ndeveloping countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America\r\nand the most industrialized countries, like Germany\r\nand Japan.\r\nAs regards the rotating category, we continue to\r\nfavour the addition of new seats for countries in Africa,\r\nAsia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, thus making\r\nit possible to have an enlarged Council of some 24\r\nmembers. Irrespective of the final formula, we stress\r\nthe importance for the Eastern European Group to get\r\nan additional non-permanent seat. We see the\r\nestablishment of rotating permanent seats as an option\r\nto be examined by each specific regional group, even if\r\nwe are not very much in favour of adding new\r\ncategories of membership. On the other hand, some\r\nchanges in the current shape of the regional groups\r\nmight be considered, especially if future reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is to be linked with specific regional\r\narrangements.\r\nWith regard to the veto, which remains the most\r\nsensitive issue, we have no problem with its use by\r\nfuture permanent members. We are aware of some\r\nconcerns expressed by various Member States and the\r\nideas they put forward, ranging from total abolition of\r\nthe veto to a restriction of its scope and application to\r\nno change whatsoever. From our viewpoint, the veto\r\nremains an essential tool to ensure that the Security\r\nCouncil can preserve international peace and security.\r\nRomania considers periodic reviews of the\r\nstructure and functioning of the Security Council as an\r\nimportant part of our reform exercise. We consider that\r\n15 years would be a reasonable timeframe to assess the\r\nperformance of the reform package.\r\nTo conclude, let me express our conviction that at\r\nthe current international juncture, it has become\r\nimperative to focus on what we have in common,\r\ntrying at the same time to break through those issues\r\nwhere divergences still exist. The Romanian delegation\r\nwill spare no effort, alongside other delegations, to be\r\nuseful and to assist the President and the distinguished\r\nVice-Chairmen in this important endeavour.\r\nMr. Gauto Vielman (Paraguay) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Last year, at the Millennium Summit, the\r\nheads of State issued an appeal for us to redouble our\r\nefforts to introduce broad reforms into the Security\r\nCouncil in all its aspects. The need for reforming the\r\nCouncil is becoming ever more evident today, when the\r\nworld is confronting new threats to international peace\r\nand security. Recent events have given us notice that\r\nthe world has changed and that new realities and new\r\nchallenges have arisen. Consequently, if we want the\r\nOrganization to strengthen its operational capacity as\r\nan instrument for the preservation and strengthening of\r\ninternational peace, we must do everything in our\r\npower to adapt to the changes and challenges imposed\r\nupon us by the new global reality and to take the\r\nnecessary decisions to this end.\r\nThe Security Council, established by the Charter\r\nas the organ responsible for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, is today facing the\r\nimperative need to bring its composition and structure\r\ninto line with the demands of the new global reality.\r\nAny delay in taking a decision would only serve to\r\ncreate further doubt about the true intentions with\r\nregard to reforming the Council.\r\nThe best example of the new reality faced by our\r\nOrganization is the recently adopted Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which makes it clear that the\r\nCouncil will have to expand its sphere of action,\r\nthereby making clear the imperative need for reform.\r\nMore than ever before, we need close interaction\r\nbetween the Council and the entire membership of the\r\nOrganization. The effective implementation of\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) requires the will and\r\ncooperation of all Member States. For this we need a\r\nrepresentative, equitable and transparent Council.\r\nOn this subject, allow me to repeat in this plenary\r\nthe principal elements underlying the position of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay.\r\nFirst, we believe that the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil should be comprehensive so that its\r\ncomposition becomes more equitable, representative\r\nand transparent in order to make a better political\r\nbalance possible.\r\nSecondly, we support the increase in both\r\ncategories of membership, permanent and non-\r\npermanent, and including developed and developing\r\ncountries, particularly taking into account that\r\ndeveloping countries are currently under-represented,\r\neven though their role in international affairs has\r\nincrease considerably.\r\nThirdly, reform should include an improvement in\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council. Greater\r\ntransparency and participation by the rest of the\r\nmembership of the United Nations are essential\r\nelements of reform.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nFourthly, reform should include the gradual\r\nelimination of the right of veto on the part of the\r\npermanent members.\r\nEight years have gone by since the creation of the\r\nWorking Group to study concrete measures to improve\r\nthe structure and functioning of the Security Council.\r\nThe extent and content of this debate clearly reflect the\r\nextreme complexity of the subject and the need for\r\nreform. Nevertheless, these very considerations compel\r\nus to show evidence of some progress in our\r\ndeliberations, preferably on specific measures based on\r\nconsensus, and to prevent our discussion from being\r\nbogged down in routine repetition.\r\nThe delegation of Paraguay is determined to\r\ncontinue working within the framework of the Open-\r\nended Working Group of the General Assembly, since\r\nwe believe that it is the appropriate forum in which to\r\naddress the question in a broad and participatory\r\napproach. We are ready to cooperate with and support\r\nthe efforts of its officers so that, next year, when this\r\nimportant subject arises again in the General Assembly,\r\nwe will be able to change the tone of our statements\r\nand to applaud the progress achieved.\r\nIn conclusion, we reaffirm that recent events have\r\nrevealed the need for and importance of the Security\r\nCouncil. We therefore cannot go on postponing a\r\npolitical decision on this subject indefinitely, since we\r\nmust comply with the mandate laid down by our heads\r\nof State and Government when they adopted the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group for its efforts in preparing\r\nthe report under consideration. In our opinion, the\r\nreport reflects the experience of the international\r\ncommunity in one of the main organs of the United\r\nNations, the Security Council.\r\nAll States are calling for the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in terms of its composition, rules of\r\nprocedure, decision-making process and power of veto.\r\nA great deal has been said in this regard, but Iraq’s\r\nexperience with the Council, despite its bitterness,\r\nremains a very rich one by dint of its unique character.\r\nIt is testimony to a major imbalance in the nature of the\r\nCouncil’s work and represents a deviation from the\r\nprovisions of the Charter that clearly stipulate the\r\nparameters within which the Council discharges its\r\nlegal authority and mandate.\r\nOver the past 10 years, the Security Council has\r\ndealt with Iraq neither on the basis of the Charter nor in\r\nthe interests of the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, but rather on behalf of the narrow\r\ninterests of one State that dominates the Council’s\r\nwork. This has been done without regard to the legal or\r\nhumanitarian principles on which the Charter is based.\r\nThe relationship between Iraq and the Council is\r\na manifestation of another egregious imbalance in the\r\nCouncil’s work. The Council’s resolutions remain\r\nopen-ended and have indefinite objectives. The\r\nreformulation of these resolutions has become a matter\r\nof course whenever one or two States feel that the\r\nCouncil must fulfil its obligations to Iraq once we have\r\nfully honoured our commitments. In these instances,\r\nthe Council adopts resolutions that have absolutely no\r\nrelation to the main issue on which they were\r\noriginally adopted. Furthermore, these new resolutions\r\nare diametrically opposed to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter and the rules of international\r\nlaw. This testifies to the need to establish machinery to\r\nassess the legitimacy of the Security Council’s\r\nresolutions.\r\nIraq therefore reserves the right to hold the\r\nCouncil accountable for any resolution it suspects\r\neither of non-compliance with the spirit and the letter\r\nof the Charter or of circumventing the Council’s\r\nresponsibilities in other cases, such as those of\r\nPalestine and Afghanistan. Such accountability should\r\nbe to the General Assembly or the International Court\r\nof Justice, depending on the nature of the action taken.\r\nThe relationship between the Security Council\r\nand Iraq represents, in reality, nothing more than a\r\nrelationship between Iraq and two permanent members\r\nof the Council — indeed, perhaps only one permanent\r\nmember. The Council has thus violated an important\r\nprinciple of the Charter, which requires it to act on\r\nbehalf of the States Members of the United Nations,\r\nnot of one State Member. The Council does not act on\r\nthe basis of the wishes of certain actors that dominate\r\nits decision-making process in accordance with their\r\nown political and economic interests. We feel that it is\r\nwrong for the Council to be so selective. Its selectivity\r\nis evident not only in its relationship with Iraq, but also\r\nin its dealings with Palestine, and is manifest in the\r\nCouncil’s scandalously passive positions vis-à-vis the\r\nZionist crimes that have been perpetrated against the\r\nPalestinian people for more than 50 years.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nRegrettably, the Council has sought to make its\r\nrelationship with Iraq a model and precedent to\r\nfrighten other States. This was to be achieved through\r\nthe adoption of measures whose political essence was\r\nconcealed under a facade of legality, although they\r\nwere actually at great variance with the legal bases of\r\nthe United Nations Charter and international law. In\r\nthis respect, the Security Council has not heeded\r\ninternational law, and that in turn has had a negative\r\nimpact on the humanitarian situation in Iraq. That in\r\nitself constitutes a violation of human rights — rights\r\nwhich the international community is supposed to\r\nuphold.\r\nIs it not strange that the Council has made itself\r\nboth judge and prosecutor? It must be the judge, not\r\nthe prosecutor. The continuation of such a situation is\r\ncreating a major imbalance; it represents a violation of\r\nthe values enshrined in the Charter, and the matter must\r\nbe dealt with in a radical manner.\r\nThe story of the Security Council’s relations with\r\nIraq deserves hard scrutiny. It is reflected in a number\r\nof grave injustices imposed by the Council — or,\r\nrather, by just two members of the Council acting in\r\nthe name of the United Nations — on Iraq. The\r\nquestion of Iraq is considered in the Security Council\r\nbehind closed doors, not only during informal\r\nconsultations and meetings in caucus rooms, but also in\r\ncapitals. The objective is to prevent Iraq from attending\r\nany discussions or meetings and thereby to exclude it\r\nfrom considering any draft resolutions relating to it that\r\nmight be adopted.\r\nSuch practices are not confined to the Council\r\nproper, but extend also to its subsidiary organs. That\r\nsituation applies to the well-known Committee\r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 661 (1990), which\r\nconsiders matters of grave importance for Iraq —\r\nmatters affecting the life and the economy of the entire\r\nIraqi people: humanitarian civilian needs, including\r\nfood, medicine, electricity, water and transport.\r\nHowever, consideration of all these matters takes place\r\nwithout any transparency. The representative of Iraq\r\nmust wait outside with journalists and others if he\r\nwants to obtain some information about those\r\nmeetings. As I said, such meetings affect the daily lives\r\nof Iraqi citizens, yet the representative of Iraq is not\r\nallowed to enter the room or to participate, or even to\r\nknow what decisions are being taken by the\r\nCommittee, although those decisions relate to\r\nfoodstuffs and medicines that have an impact on the\r\ndaily lives of the Iraqi people.\r\nIt is only reasonable and logical that States such\r\nas Iraq should play a major role in the discussions of\r\nthe Council and of Committees when such discussions\r\naffect the life of an entire people. Where is\r\ntransparency? Transparency exists among only some\r\nmembers of the Council, not all. The non-permanent\r\nmembers and some of the permanent members do not\r\nparticipate in those discussions. That is a very serious\r\nmatter. Where is the transparency in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council?\r\nDo not such practices fly in the face of the\r\nmission of the United Nations? I would like to provide\r\na clear example of this. A few days ago, when the\r\nSecurity Council discussed the matter of the embargo\r\nin general, it listened to the views of representatives of\r\nStates that have no relevance to the embargo itself,\r\nexcept from a technical and financial point of view:\r\nSwitzerland, which I do not believe has faced an\r\nembargo or blockade, and Germany, which I do not\r\nbelieve has been the victim of an embargo recently.\r\nThose two States were involved in the discussions\r\nbecause they had held certain workshops on the\r\nmatter — also behind closed doors and within high\r\nwalls. Participants in those workshops were invited on\r\na selective basis; nobody considered inviting Iraq,\r\nwhich has been under embargo for 10 years. They did\r\nnot even think about the benefits of such an experience\r\nfor us.\r\nDuring those discussions in the Council, Iraq was\r\nnot invited to participate, and for one reason only: it is\r\nthe only country in the world that has suffered the\r\nmost, throughout its history, from such embargoes, and\r\nit is best able to share its bitter experience with the\r\nCouncil so that the whole world hears and benefits\r\nfrom it. In that way, the whole world would not repeat\r\nthe mistake that it made when it adopted its criminal\r\nresolutions against the people of Iraq. I would like to\r\nstress that such resolutions are criminal. I repeat:\r\ninvitations were not extended.\r\nArticles 31 and 32 of the Charter stipulate that the\r\ncountries affected by conflict should participate in\r\ndeliberations of the Council and that their viewpoints\r\nmust be heard. Yet Iraq is never present at the meetings\r\nof the Council and the Committee established pursuant\r\nto resolution 661 (1990), which takes decisions\r\naffecting the daily life of the Iraqi people.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nI apologize for speaking at such length, but I must\r\nsay that the credibility of the Security Council has been\r\nlost and that its legitimacy is being put to the test.\r\nThere are many questions that cannot be resolved\r\nwithout a radical reform process. The dictatorship of\r\nthe unipolar system has created double standards,\r\nselectivity and a lack of transparency; the peripheral\r\ninformal meetings of the Council are an incurable\r\ndisease. The weakness of the Council — its inability to\r\nadopt resolutions to deal with severe and difficult\r\ncrises, its failure to implement Article 24 of the Charter\r\nand its interpretation of Chapter VII in an\r\nunprecedented and selective manner — all oblige the\r\nAssembly to live up to its historic responsibilities.\r\nIn this difficult situation, the Assembly must take\r\naction under resolution 377 (V), entitled “Uniting for\r\npeace”. Otherwise, we will face more Palestines and\r\nmore Afghanistans, and international security, which\r\nhas already collapsed, will be completely destroyed.\r\nHow can the Security Council turn a blind eye to\r\nthe grave crimes that are being perpetrated in its\r\nname — let alone give its blessing to them? More than\r\n1.5 million Iraqis have been killed with the blessing of\r\nthe Security Council. The entire Iraqi infrastructure has\r\nbeen completely destroyed right under the Council’s\r\nnose. And following the usurpation of their land under\r\nCouncil resolutions, the Palestinians are being killed.\r\nAnd now, a people with absolutely no possessions\r\nto their name — the people of Afghanistan — are being\r\ndestroyed before the very eyes of the United Nations.\r\nThey are the victims of brutal aggression, which is\r\nclaiming thousands of lives. And the Security Council\r\nremains silent.\r\nIraq’s position on reform of the Security Council\r\ncan be summarized as follows. First, the veto should be\r\nrestricted as a prelude to its abolition as a symbol of\r\ndiscrimination among States and as a violation of the\r\nCharter principle of sovereign equality. Second, rules\r\nof procedure must be adopted to ensure transparency\r\nand justice and to guarantee the Charter rights of\r\nStates. Third, Council membership must be increased\r\nin a way that will ensure the democratic representation\r\nof the international community. Fourth, permanent\r\nmembership should be abolished; this would ensure\r\ngenuinely equal rights and duties for all Council\r\nmembers. Fifth, the Council, as an executive political\r\nbody, should refrain from adopting resolutions of a\r\nlegislative nature; interpretation of the provisions of\r\nthe Charter and of Council resolutions should be the\r\nprovince of the International Court of Justice. Sixth,\r\nmeasures must be adopted to ensure the Council’s\r\naccountability to the General Assembly. Seventh, the\r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice must\r\nencompass supervision of Security Council resolutions,\r\neither automatically or on the request of Member\r\nStates. Eighth, the use of the Council as a tool for\r\ncarrying out the foreign policy of a certain State must\r\nstop, and the collective international responsibility of\r\nthe Council, as a United Nations organ, must be\r\nreaffirmed. Ninth, non-members of the Council, in\r\nparticular the States directly concerned, must be kept\r\ninformed about Council deliberations on resolutions\r\nwith a bearing on international peace and security; for\r\nthe sake of transparency, Council meetings must be\r\nopen to all States without exception; informal meetings\r\nshould be kept to a minimum, except for technical\r\nreasons. Tenth, the Council must adopt principles of\r\npreventive diplomacy, recourse to Chapter VI of the\r\nCharter and the use of all peaceful means to settle\r\nconflict between States; the use of Chapter VII to\r\nimpoverish peoples or to attack States must be\r\nprohibited. And finally, Council members should\r\nabstain in the voting on draft resolutions pertaining to\r\nconflicts to which they are parties.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): Under the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Security Council bears primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. That very mandate also requires the\r\nSecurity Council to be truly international, in terms of\r\nnot only its mandate but also its representation. The\r\nproblems of international peace and security facing us\r\ntoday call for a more representative Security Council\r\nthat reflects the existing realities — not those of the\r\nlast century, but those of today. The understanding\r\nreached at the Millennium Summit on intensifying\r\nefforts to achieve comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects — structural and\r\nprocedural reform — should be taken more seriously.\r\nOnly then can early comprehensive reform of the\r\nCouncil be realized.\r\nMoreover, the Council should not be feudal in\r\nnature and undemocratic in character in an\r\nOrganization some of whose leading Members call for\r\na transparent and democratic world order. The general\r\nunderstanding among States Members of the\r\nOrganization is that the Council should be reformed\r\nand enlarged to make it more representative, credible\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nand legitimate. Hence, that reform must be concretized\r\nand put in place. We long for a Council that truly\r\nrepresents and hears us, not a Council that dictates. We\r\nbelieve that the Council as it stands now lacks the\r\nnecessary moral high ground it is expected to have.\r\nThe decision-making process within the Council\r\nalso needs to be more transparent. The lack of\r\ntransparency and accountability in the Council has a lot\r\nto do with the issue of addressing the ongoing question\r\nof representation and procedural reform. As I said\r\nearlier, the Council must become truly representative of\r\nthe general membership of the Organization, on the\r\nbasis of the principle of equitable geographic\r\ndistribution, taking into particular account the urgent\r\nneeds of the developing world.\r\nEthiopia fully endorses the positions of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement on this issue. As the new Chairman of the\r\nAfrican working group on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, we believe that Africa should have a\r\npermanent rotating seat. By this I mean permanent for\r\nAfrica as a whole, but rotational among States, with the\r\nsame privileges enjoyed by the permanent members.\r\nProportional representation by non-permanent\r\nmembers from Africa, since the continent accounts for\r\nmore than one quarter of the Organization’s\r\nmembership, also needs due consideration in any\r\ndebate on or formulation of the reform issue.\r\nMoreover, since most of the problems being dealt with\r\nby the Council now — and many for some time to\r\ncome — are related primarily to the African continent,\r\nAfrica’s representation in the Council would\r\nundoubtedly strengthen the Council’s capacity to\r\nrespond to and resolve effectively and appropriately the\r\ndaunting challenges ahead of it.\r\nThe final formula to be drawn up on the issue\r\nshould take into account and adequately reflect these\r\nlegitimate and genuine concerns of our continent. I said\r\nearlier that it does not mirror the reality of today but\r\nrather that of the last century. The last time this was put\r\nin place, some countries, because of their military\r\nposition and economic contribution and muscle, were\r\ngiven — or took — the permanent seats. Today the\r\nreality is different. There are many others on the\r\noutside who have more economic muscle than one or\r\ntwo of those who hold permanent seats. There are also\r\nthose who may be military equals. There are also\r\npowers that have nuclear weapons. Are these factors\r\ngoing to be the criteria?\r\nSome of the aforementioned factors were used in\r\nthe past. In our view, this should not have been done.\r\nBut we hope that the continuing debate on this issue\r\nwill be not only fruitful, but also short, for the sake of\r\nour Organization and for those peoples around the\r\nworld whom we represent.\r\nMr. Alcalay (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like to begin by acknowledging the important\r\nefforts and the contribution of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup led at the last session by Mr. Harri Holkeri, who\r\nmade a distinguished contribution to the subject we are\r\ndiscussing today.\r\nThis subject, reform of the Security Council, has\r\nonce again roused interest on the part of a very large\r\nnumber of delegations. We have listened to them with\r\nattention and interest over the last three days, and we\r\nagree with the majority that there is a sense of\r\nfrustration at the small progress on this crucial and\r\nfundamental issue.\r\nThe Millennium Summit last year presented an\r\nopportunity for our heads of State and Government to\r\nexpress their decision to redouble their efforts to bring\r\nabout broad reform in the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. This was reflected in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nOne of the aspects is the question of the veto. We\r\nhave repeatedly advocated making the Security Council\r\nmore transparent, more democratic and more\r\nrepresentative, because at the present time we do not\r\nhave a body that possesses these attributes. We\r\nconsider that the veto — which had a raison d’être\r\nhistorically but now is simply an anti-democratic\r\npractice — permits one country to oppose the majority\r\nof the others when its views are different from the\r\nmajority opinion.\r\nWe support the elimination of the use of the veto,\r\nin accordance with the exercise of the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of States, as stated by the President\r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez\r\nFrías, in this very Hall last year, when he issued an\r\nurgent appeal to the international community for the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations. He clearly\r\nproposed the elimination of the veto, which earned him\r\na strong ovation and the gratitude of General Assembly\r\nmembers. This shows our agreement on this subject.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nWe think that the question of the veto is of vital\r\nimportance. Nevertheless, we consider that the process\r\nof Security Council reform should take place within a\r\ncomprehensive framework. It should take into\r\naccount — apart from this crucial point — the\r\nexpansion of the Council and improvements in its\r\nworking methods.\r\nThese are three aspects that should be dealt with\r\nfrom a comprehensive perspective. The search for this\r\ncomprehensive solution should be guided by the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States and the\r\nright of member States to irrevocable representation in\r\nthe organs of limited membership, as in the case of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts made by the Open-\r\nended Working Group since its establishment in 1993.\r\nWe believe that it should continue to be the appropriate\r\nforum for seeking the necessary formulas for bringing\r\nabout general agreement to promote greater\r\ntransparency and efficiency in the Security Council.\r\nMy country is involved in a process of change\r\naimed at bringing about effective democratic\r\nparticipation in its political system. Therefore, we\r\nfirmly believe that it is necessary to transform the most\r\nimportant political organ of the United Nations, created\r\nwithin the context of the cold war, to guarantee peace\r\nand security in the world.\r\nThe realities are different today. This organ of the\r\nUnited Nations needs to adapt itself to the signs of the\r\ntime. It must be oriented to the new international\r\nrelations in order to become truly democratic,\r\ntransparent, impartial and accountable to the whole\r\ninternational community. The commitment of all\r\nMember States in the face of this challenge cannot be\r\navoided for much longer. We must highlight the fact\r\nthat an important result has been achieved in the\r\nWorking Group, and that is the general consensus that\r\nhas arisen around this reform process. It is a task that\r\ncannot be postponed.\r\nWhat is at stake in this process is the legitimacy\r\nand authority of one of the principal organs of our\r\nworld Organization. It is not for lack of consensus that\r\nthis process has not been fruitful. At the heart of the\r\nmatter, what is lacking is political will. Therefore, we\r\nmust join in our efforts in a constructive spirit, with\r\nflexibility, to promote an arrangement that would\r\nembrace all of the aspects involved in a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation will continue to lend its vigorous\r\nsupport to ensure that the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group achieves its objective of reforming the\r\nSecurity Council and thereby stripping it of its current\r\ncharacter as a repository of the interests of just a few\r\nnations.\r\nToday’s realities demonstrate once again that\r\nmajor global challenges require major efforts, broad-\r\nbased commitments and deep solidarity. These realities\r\nmake it necessary for institutions to measure up to the\r\ndemands made upon them to respond effectively and\r\nappropriately, in an open-minded manner, to the\r\nchallenges posed by the international system, in order\r\nto benefit all peoples equally, without discrimination of\r\nany kind.\r\nWe need a Security Council that acts in\r\naccordance with internationally agreed norms — a\r\nSecurity Council that has reassumed its proper role as\r\nguarantor of international peace and security. This\r\nchallenge has now become an imperative for the good\r\ngovernance of this Organization and for the destiny of\r\nsucceeding generations.\r\nMs. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to express my sincere gratitude to the\r\nformer President of the General Assembly, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, for his fruitful work as the Chairman of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform. We deeply appreciate his tireless efforts in\r\ndealing with this important subject, which has engaged\r\nthe United Nations system for a number of years. We\r\nacknowledge that the Working Group has made some\r\nprogress and has had an effect on the working methods\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nWe believe that Mr. Han will continue the process\r\nin the same manner and that the Working Group will be\r\nable to achieve more tangible results in the next round\r\nof consultations. We should fulfil the task entrusted to\r\nus by our leaders and intensify our efforts in order to\r\nachieve a comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in all its aspects. To sustain the impetus of the\r\nMillennium Summit, we should move forward from\r\ndiscussions into negotiations by focusing on elements\r\nof the reform package where agreement is possible.\r\nThrough our discussions in the framework of the\r\nWorking Group, it has become clear that the great\r\nmajority of Member States support the expansion of\r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent membership of\r\nthe Council. Kazakhstan reaffirms its support for the\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nenlargement of the Security Council in both categories.\r\nThe ultimate objective of the expansion is to make the\r\nCouncil more representative, on the basis of the\r\nprinciples of equitable geographical representation and\r\nof respect for the sovereign equality of all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nMy country is in favour of increasing the number\r\nof permanent members of the Security Council through\r\nthe inclusion in its membership of three developing\r\ncountries from the Asian, African and Latin American\r\nand Caribbean regions, as well as two industrialized\r\ncountries, with a view to ensuring a balance of interests\r\nand an adequate reflection of existing geopolitical\r\nrealities. We have long placed on record our support\r\nfor Germany and Japan, taking into consideration their\r\nsignificant role in the multifaceted activities of the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as their substantial contribution\r\nto the United Nations budget.\r\nWith regard to the expansion of the category of\r\nnon-permanent members of the Council, we advocate\r\nobservance of the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution, in accordance with the criteria set forth in\r\nArticle 23 of the United Nations Charter. We believe\r\nthat the size of an enlarged Security Council must be\r\nlimited to a number that would enable the Council to\r\nmaintain its decision-making effectiveness and to\r\npromote greater transparency.\r\nOne of the most essential and sensitive elements\r\nof Security Council reform is the question of the veto.\r\nIn our view, the veto has to be applicable to the new\r\npermanent members of the Council so as to avoid the\r\ncreation of intermediate categories of membership in\r\nthe Security Council. This question has to be dealt with\r\nin the context of complex measures aimed at reforming\r\nthe Council.\r\nAt the same time, as we have already noted more\r\nthan once, an extremely balanced approach needs to be\r\ntaken with respect to this issue as part of a complex\r\nseries of measures to reform the Council. We believe\r\nthat any new permanent members should have equal\r\nrights with the permanent five members as regards the\r\nuse of the veto.\r\nMany delegations have stressed the need to\r\nrestrict the use of the veto, Kazakhstan among them.\r\nWe believe that that the use of the veto, like that of any\r\nother powerful instrument, should be constrained. It\r\nshould be exercised only when the question is of vital\r\nimportance to the United Nations as a whole. Every\r\neffort should be made to arrive at a consensus decision\r\nin the Working Group so that the veto need not be used.\r\nDuring the recent discussion of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, my delegation welcomed the efforts\r\nof the Council to promote its openness. While\r\nrecognizing some progress in this field, we call for\r\nmore transparency in the Council’s work. We believe\r\nthat its working methods could be improved by holding\r\nmore frequent interactive discussions between the\r\nCouncil and non-Council members, as well as open\r\nmeetings and briefings with the participation of the\r\nSecretary-General, his special representatives and the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat.\r\nMy delegation also commented on the report of\r\nthe Security Council itself. We noted that its discussion\r\ndid not attract much attention from delegations because\r\nit lacked an analytical component. We expect the\r\nSecretariat to present an analytical and informative\r\nreport of the Security Council, so as to make our future\r\ndiscussions more fruitful and meaningful.\r\nThe recent terrorist attacks on the United States\r\nof America presented an unprecedented challenge to\r\nthe international community and forced it to consider\r\nthe issue of international terrorism as one of its\r\npriorities. The Security Council is now entrusted with a\r\ncentral role in the elaboration of a global strategy\r\nagainst international terrorism. Today more than ever,\r\nwe should pursue our common goal of having a strong\r\nbody — one that is effective, representative and\r\ntransparent — to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity and to respond adequately to the new\r\nchallenges that have emerged.\r\nWe believe that the completion of the process of\r\nSecurity Council reform will enable the Council to\r\ncope with its expanding responsibilities more\r\neffectively and to resolve the serious regional and\r\nglobal problems that exist, including the successful\r\nsettlement of the Afghan crisis.\r\nWe believe that a compromise solution on the\r\nreform package as a whole can be achieved only\r\nthrough mutual trust and positive cooperation. In this\r\nregard, Kazakhstan will continue to be engaged\r\nactively and constructively in this endeavour.\r\nMr. Mmualefe (Botswana): Allow me at the\r\noutset to congratulate Cameroon, Guinea, the Syrian\r\nArab Republic, Bulgaria and Mexico on their recent\r\nelection to five non-permanent seats on the Security\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nCouncil for a two-year term commencing on 1 January\r\n2002. It is our fervent hope that these members will\r\ncontinue to champion the cause of the item under\r\nconsideration, namely, equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate the President of the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, and his Vice-Chairmen, the Permanent\r\nRepresentatives of Iceland and Sri Lanka, for\r\ncoordinating the work of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup that produced this report (A/55/47).\r\nAs frustrating as it is that, eight years since the\r\nadoption of resolution 48/26, on 3 December 1993,\r\nlittle substantive progress has yet been made towards\r\nits final implementation, our resolve to see this process\r\nthrough to its natural conclusion remains undiminished.\r\nAfter all, the issues at hand are central to the very\r\nsuccess of our Organization, its effectiveness and\r\nultimate existence.\r\nThe goals are unambiguous, necessary and\r\ninevitable. The need to increase the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council to reflect the realities of today’s\r\nadjusted balance of power cannot be overemphasized.\r\nMy delegation fully aligns itself with the position\r\nadopted by the African Group on the extent of the\r\nexpansion required for both categories of membership,\r\npermanent and non-permanent.\r\nWe continue to call for a limit on the use of the\r\nveto and its eventual elimination, as it has outlived its\r\nusefulness.\r\nEqually important is the need to reform the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council in a way that\r\nwill make its operations transparent and allow for\r\nwider participation of the United Nations membership\r\nin its activities. We note here the progress that has been\r\nachieved to date, but are of the view that much still\r\nneeds to be done even in institutionalizing what has so\r\nfar been agreed.\r\nWe believe that it is incumbent on the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations to stand up for the democratization\r\nof our body. We cannot continue to be held to ransom\r\nby the will of a minority at the expense of the majority.\r\nThis is not a time to deny the citizens of the world a\r\nvoice. If we are to claim to be defending the ideals of\r\npeace, prosperity and fundamental freedoms for all,\r\nthen we shall be failing in our mandate if we curtail the\r\nvery processes which promise to transform those ideals\r\ninto reality.\r\nMany of us in the developing world recognize\r\nthat the realization of a peaceful continent relies to a\r\nsignificant degree on our ability to relieve the burden\r\nof social and economic deprivation suffered by our vast\r\npopulace. Many have pointed out the failure of the\r\nSecurity Council to demonstrate a sympathy for us in\r\nour particular brand of instability, born to a large\r\ndegree of social ills. We continue to stress the\r\nimportance of coordinating the work of the Council\r\nwith that of the Economic and Social Council to make\r\nsure that the root causes of conflict are adequately\r\naddressed, with long-lasting results.\r\nThe African continent, together with other\r\nequally deserving regions, only demands its democratic\r\nright to proper representation. We cannot and will not\r\nallow our interests to remain subordinate to those of\r\nmajor Powers. There would be no greater\r\ndemonstration of the permanent membership’s sincerity\r\nabout the stated goals of engaging our interests\r\nconstructively than the simple acknowledgement of our\r\nexistence and rightful claim to this representation.\r\nThe insistence on limited expansion is a veiled\r\nattempt to continue to subordinate the perceived\r\npariahs of the global system and retain the Council as a\r\nhub for the privileged few. Excuses of possible\r\nineffectiveness only contribute to the perception that\r\nwe are unable to govern sensibly and act decisively. It\r\nis our contention that we are no less, and equally, no\r\nmore capable than those currently deciding our fate.\r\nThe very premise on which this Organization was\r\ncreated was that of inclusion, not exclusion.\r\nI reiterate that our agitation for real and\r\nmeaningful reform is unshakeable. Cluster I and II\r\nissues must be considered in tandem; they are mutually\r\ninclusive and therefore must be considered as parts of a\r\nwhole. The improvement of working methods alone in\r\nthe Security Council does not provide the entire answer\r\nto the problem at hand. Let us indeed recall the\r\nMillennium Declaration of 8 September 2000, in which\r\nour heads of State and Government committed\r\nthemselves to “intensify our efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects” (resolution 55/21, para. 30). There is no\r\nambiguity in that.\r\nMr. Bakhit (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike at the outset to express our gratitude to the former\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Holkeri, for his\r\nleadership of our efforts to reform the Security\r\nCouncil. I also extend my gratitude to the Ambassadors\r\nof Sri Lanka and Iceland for their efforts in preparing\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\nthe comprehensive report before the General Assembly\r\non the reform of the Security Council.\r\nIt is regrettable that the General Assembly is\r\nmeeting today for the eighth consecutive year to\r\nconsider the reform of the Security Council, a matter to\r\nwhich we attach great importance because of the\r\nimportant role that the Council plays in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMember States are trying to make the Council\r\nmore democratic and more representative of the wider\r\nmembership of the Organization, in accordance with\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter. Our leaders expressed their interest in the\r\nreform of the Security Council in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which calls for us to intensify our efforts\r\nto effect a comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil — a responsibility we should fulfil.\r\nMy delegation has expressed its position on\r\nCouncil reform in its active participation in the work of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group, through the statement\r\nof the President of Sudan at the Millennium Summit\r\nand through the statements of the Foreign Minister\r\nduring recent sessions of the General Assembly. It is a\r\nposition fully in line with that of the countries of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement on the importance of\r\nreforming the Council in its two categories of\r\nmembers — permanent and non-permanent — within\r\nthe framework of equitable geographic representation.\r\nThis reform would make the Council more\r\nrepresentative of the wider membership of the United\r\nNations, improve its working methods and make the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making more democratic and more\r\ntransparent.\r\nI will not reiterate this position in detail here, but\r\nI affirm once more that it is important to consider\r\nCouncil reform and the expansion of its membership as\r\nan integral part of a whole, comprehensive package.\r\nSudan supports the African position, which calls for\r\ntwo non-permanent seats to be allocated according to\r\nthe principle of rotation followed by the Organization\r\nof African Unity. Africa requires particular\r\nconsideration regarding Council membership by taking\r\ninto account the types of conflict Africa is\r\nexperiencing. Most of the Security Council agenda\r\nrelates to Africa. This requires intensive African\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council, especially\r\namong permanent and non-permanent members. This\r\nwill strengthen the Council’s ability to deal with\r\nAfrican conflicts and find valid solutions to them.\r\nAs for the right of veto, my delegation renews its\r\nposition, the position of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\ncalling for abolition of the veto. That could be done\r\ngradually, starting by restricting that right, which some\r\npermanent members use in the Security Council for\r\ntheir narrow national interests, without taking into\r\nconsideration the wider United Nations membership,\r\non whose behalf the Security Council acts.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to point out that we have\r\nbeen following up the work of the Security Council and\r\nthus we appreciate its efforts to reform its working\r\nmethods and promote transparency. We also appreciate\r\nits efforts in responding to our plea to end the embargo\r\nagainst our country, the participation of some\r\npermanent members of the Security Council in the\r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group and many of\r\nthe views presented during the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on reforming the working methods of\r\nthe Security Council, as they represent the majority\r\nviews of the membership on increasing its\r\ntransparency, reforming its working methods and being\r\nable to face the threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Jacob (Israel): The State of Israel supports\r\nthe initiative to reform the Security Council. It is our\r\nbelief that more equitable representation and greater\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council can only serve\r\nto increase its credibility and effectiveness.\r\nSince the founding of the United Nations in 1945,\r\nand even more so since the last expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council in 1965, the world has changed\r\ndrastically. In the last 36 years more than 70 new\r\nMember States have been admitted to the United\r\nNations. The end of the cold war, the trend towards\r\ndemocracy, the sweeping tide of globalization, the rise\r\nof new economic Powers — all these and more have\r\ncombined to profoundly alter the shape of our world\r\nand the ways in which nations relate to one another.\r\nThe scourge of terrorism, whose deadly intentions were\r\nhorrifically demonstrated on 11 September, poses yet\r\nanother urgent challenge to the international\r\ncommunity. The Security Council must adapt itself to\r\nfaithfully reflect these new geopolitical and economic\r\nrealities. At the same time, the Council’s effectiveness\r\nmust be maintained.\r\nIsrael supports the initiative to increase\r\nmembership in the Council to reflect the increased\r\nmembership of the United Nations as a whole and more\r\nfaithfully represent the broad array of interests of\r\nMember States. We must, however, endeavour to strike\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.36\r\na balance between the need to ensure that the Council\r\nfaithfully embodies the larger will of the Organization\r\nand the need to maintain the Council’s capacity to fulfil\r\nits responsibilities under the Charter.\r\nIsrael further supports the initiatives to provide\r\nthe membership of the Organization with improved\r\naccess to the Council’s proceedings. Meetings should\r\nbe conducted in an open format whenever possible and\r\nsteps should be taken to ensure that reliable\r\ninformation is made available to Member States.\r\nGreater transparency will serve to reinforce confidence\r\nin the Council not only within the United Nations, but\r\nin the world beyond.\r\nAs we consider measures to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the Security Council, we must remain\r\ncognizant of our ultimate goal of increased efficiency\r\nand effectiveness. We must further take care to ensure\r\nthat any change reflects general agreement among\r\nMember States.\r\nWith regard to the issue of equitable\r\nrepresentation, I would like at this point to take note of\r\nthe fact that Israel is now a full, though temporary,\r\nmember of the Western European and other States\r\nGroup. Inclusion in the Group has helped to rectify an\r\nanomaly that affects no other Member State, and is an\r\nimportant step, albeit a first step, towards Israel’s full\r\nintegration into the United Nations. This process,\r\nhowever, is still in its infancy. To fully realize the\r\nprinciple of sovereign equality, as laid down in Article\r\n2 of the Charter, Israel’s acceptance in a regional\r\ngrouping must be extended to all United Nations\r\nheadquarters around the world, as well as to all\r\nspecialized agencies and international bodies and\r\norgans created by international instruments. Israel must\r\nalso become eligible for the same candidatures as are\r\nall other United Nations members. Until that time,\r\nIsrael’s status within the Organization will remain\r\nunequal, a fact which should be of concern to all\r\nMember States.\r\nIt should also be noted that, while we appreciate\r\ninclusion in the Group, we remain committed to\r\nachieving membership with our natural partners in the\r\nAsian Group. In lieu of this membership, however, our\r\ninclusion in the Western European and other States\r\nGroup will serve to increase our ability to participate as\r\na full and equal Member State. The Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts in this metamorphosis were, and will continue\r\nto be, crucial to its success.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation believes that the\r\nCouncil’s credibility and effectiveness rest in its\r\ncapacity to embody the broadest range of culture and\r\nopinion and in its fidelity to the principle of equality\r\nthat forms the basis of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Fruchtbaum (Grenada): On numerous\r\noccasions in the Open-ended Working Group my\r\ndelegation has argued that a satisfactory reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is not achievable without a thorough\r\nknowledge of how the Council does its work. To\r\nacquire this knowledge, we proposed that the Working\r\nGroup receive briefings as well as detailed written\r\nmaterials about the functioning of this vital organ of\r\nthe United Nations system. For those Member States\r\nthat have never served on the Council, or have not done\r\nso for a number of years, information of this kind, it\r\nseemed to us, was essential for a fruitful consideration\r\nof Council reform. The Ambassadors of two\r\ncountries — Colombia and Singapore, now serving on\r\nthe Council — have spoken frankly, as have others,\r\nabout the problem of learning how that body operates.\r\nThe one briefing the Working Group did receive\r\nis described in paragraph 32 of the report now before\r\nus. My delegation thanks President Harri Holkeri of\r\nFinland and the Vice-Chairmen of the Working Group,\r\nAmbassador Thorsteinn Ingólfsson of Iceland and\r\nAmbassador John de Saram of Sri Lanka, for making\r\nthat briefing possible. From it we learned, inter alia,\r\nabout the note-keeping practices for the all-important\r\ninformal consultations of the whole and the existence\r\nof these notes. Their value for future historical, legal\r\nand other research is potentially very high, yet it is\r\nunclear at this time that they are destined for\r\npreservation in the archives of the United Nations.\r\nHow useful these notes, which are not available to\r\nmembers of the Security Council, could be for the\r\nongoing work of the Council needs to be considered.\r\nMy delegation believes that if the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup is to bring its efforts to a successful conclusion,\r\nit must begin as soon as feasible to arrange for the\r\npreparation of the necessary analytical and briefing\r\nmaterials about the work and procedures of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 49.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.30 a.m.\r\n"
