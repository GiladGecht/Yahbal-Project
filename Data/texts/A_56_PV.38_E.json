I would also like\r\nto express our appreciation for the extremely useful\r\nreport contained in document A/56/435, which was\r\nprepared by the secretariat of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development. This report\r\nshould, in our view, guide the deliberations that we will\r\nundertake at the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. The development of Africa has to be a\r\nspecial and sustained concern of the world community.\r\nThe General Assembly unanimously adopted the\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s at its forty-sixth session. In the Agenda, the\r\ninternational community accepted the principle of\r\nshared responsibility and of full partnership with\r\nAfrica in support of Africa’s own development efforts.\r\nThe Agenda clearly laid down Africa’s responsibilities\r\nand commitments. This included reform and structural\r\nadjustment of its economies, the promotion of regional\r\nand subregional cooperation and an intensification of\r\ndemocratic processes. The international community, as\r\npart of the compact, also undertook certain\r\nresponsibilities and commitments. These included a\r\nreaffirmation of the commitment to attain the target of\r\ndevoting 0.7 per cent of gross national product to\r\nofficial development assistance, of finding a durable\r\nsolution to the debt crisis, of supporting the\r\ndevelopment of infrastructure, of granting improved\r\nmarket access to Africa’s exports and of encouraging\r\nforeign direct investment in Africa. It was envisaged\r\nthat the fulfilment of these commitments, both by\r\nAfrica and the international community, would lead to\r\nthe achievement of the target of 6 per cent economic\r\ngrowth per annum.\r\nAfrica has, we see, largely fulfilled its obligations\r\nunder the compact. Structural adjustment programmes\r\nhave been adopted by a number of countries. In fact,\r\nsuch programmes have been applied more intensely\r\nand more frequently — and, I would say, with more\r\npain — in Africa than in any other region of the world.\r\nThere has been a deregulation of agricultural markets.\r\nThis, however, has not led to any growth in agricultural\r\noutput; in fact, cereal production has fallen behind\r\npopulation growth. Trade liberalization has been\r\nundertaken, resulting, however, in de-industrialization.\r\nCapital account liberalization has been accepted,\r\nleading only to adverse effects on exchange rates.\r\nStructural adjustment programmes have also enforced a\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\ndismantling of state-mediated mechanisms for capital\r\nformation, as well as an erosion in the role of the State\r\nin the development of human and physical\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nThe compliance of the international community\r\nwith the obligations voluntarily undertaken by it,\r\nhowever, shows an opposite picture. Official flows to\r\ndeveloping countries have fallen from $55 billion in\r\n1990 to less than $39 billion in 2000. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance has suffered a continuous and\r\ndeep decline, from 0.33 per cent of gross national\r\nproduct in 1992 to 0.24 per cent in 1999 for all\r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee countries put\r\ntogether. A permanent solution to the debt problem still\r\nproves elusive. The record of the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt (HIPC) Initiative is woefully\r\ninadequate; it suffers from underfunding, excessive\r\nconditionality and restrictions on eligibility. The weak\r\nand insufficient provisions on special and differential\r\ntreatment obtained in the Uruguay Round have been\r\neliminated, in many cases, by conditionalities. Peak\r\ntariffs and quotas, arbitrary anti-dumping and\r\ncountervailing duties, unjustified sanitary and\r\nphytosanitary restrictions and agricultural subsidies not\r\nonly generate protectionist distortions for the exports\r\nof Africa and the rest of the developing world, but also\r\nimpact adversely on the domestic markets of those\r\ncountries. Finally, foreign direct investment remains\r\nconfined to a few oil- and mineral-rich countries.\r\nThis asymmetric fulfilment of commitments by\r\nAfrica and the rest of the international community has\r\nled to a situation in which per capita income in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa is now 10 per cent below the level\r\nreached in 1980. Even the so-called satisfactory\r\nadjusters to structural adjustment programmes have not\r\nseen conditions which would be conducive to sustained\r\neconomic growth. Such programmes have, on the other\r\nhand, led to greater inequalities in income distribution.\r\nThe decline in per capita gross domestic product for\r\nthe poorest 20 per cent of the population has been\r\ntwice the overall decline.\r\nPoverty eradication on a durable basis can be\r\npredicated only on economic growth. This, in turn,\r\nrequires capital accumulation. Low-income countries,\r\nwhich are unable to meet even the basic needs of their\r\npeoples, cannot be expected to increase their domestic\r\nsavings rate. We also know from experience that\r\nforeign direct investment does not lead to economic\r\ngrowth in those countries; rather, private capital flows\r\nfollow economic growth. Debt relief by itself cannot be\r\nthe solution either. It is estimated that, even if all the\r\ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa were brought under\r\nHIPC and granted full and immediate relief on their\r\nofficial debt, the amount released would be less than\r\nhalf of their external financing requirements. The\r\narithmetic has been presented with clarity in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. It reveals that, for each\r\ndollar of net capital inflow to sub-Saharan Africa, 25\r\ncents flow out as interest payment and remittance of\r\nprofits by multinational corporations, 30 cents leak into\r\ncapital outflow and 51 cents account for terms of trade\r\nloss. In other words, there is a net transfer of resources\r\nfrom sub-Saharan Africa to the rest of the world. There\r\nis, therefore, no capital accumulation, no economic\r\ngrowth and no poverty eradication.\r\nThere is a general need to address the issues\r\nwhich have been outlined in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport and on which I have dwelt today. It is our belief\r\nthat greater domestic policy efforts by Africa cannot\r\nmake up for shortcomings in the external trading and\r\nfinancial environment. We welcome the establishment\r\nof an independent panel by the Secretary-General to\r\noversee the evaluation of the Agenda. We ask that the\r\nevaluation also provide concrete proposals for\r\nsuccessor arrangements. These, in our view, should be\r\nbased on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment adopted by the Abuja summit of October\r\n2001. We endorse the suggestion for establishing an ad\r\nhoc committee of the whole to carry out the final\r\nreview and appraisal of the Agenda and look forward\r\nto participating actively in its deliberations.\r\nThere is an obligation on all of us to do so. A few\r\nsimple figures would justify this point. The gains to the\r\neconomies of sub-Saharan Africa from the elimination\r\nof agricultural protection in countries of the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment would amount to $6 per person. Such\r\nelimination seems worthy of consideration to us, given\r\nthat more than 300 million people in Africa live on less\r\nthan $1 a day.\r\nIndia’s commitment to the development of Africa\r\nhas been firm and unwavering. It is based on solidarity,\r\nshared aspirations and concerns rooted in history,\r\ncommon colonial experience, the struggle for liberation\r\nand the striving for growth and development. We have\r\nalways considered the destinies of Asia and Africa to\r\nbe linked. We have sought to share whatever gains\r\nIndia may have achieved in its drive for self-reliance\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nand economic and technological advancement. We\r\nhave, since 1964, provided over $2 billion in technical\r\nassistance to other developing countries. The Indian\r\nTechnical and Economic Cooperation Programme, with\r\nan annual financial outlay of over $85 million,\r\nprovides training to more than 2,000 personnel from\r\ndeveloping countries every year, the majority of them\r\nfrom Africa. We have also implemented infrastructure\r\nbuilding projects, particularly in the railway sector, in\r\nvarious countries on the African continent. The area of\r\ntechnical cooperation is extensive, embracing\r\nparticularly agriculture, services and small-industry\r\ndevelopment with a view to employment generation.\r\nIndian companies have also established a number of\r\njoint ventures in Africa. We will strengthen this\r\ncooperation. It is proof of our commitment to South-\r\nSouth and Afro-Asian solidarity.\r\nMr. Hirata (Japan): Japan is determined to\r\ncontribute to the development of Africa. This is not\r\nbecause of special historical ties with the continent.\r\nJapan did not enter into full-fledged relations with\r\nAfrica until countries in the region declared their\r\nindependence from colonial rule after the Second\r\nWorld War. Japan’s determination is based, rather, on\r\nits belief that there will be no stability and prosperity\r\nin the world unless the problems of Africa are resolved.\r\nFrom this perspective, Japan places great importance\r\non the development of Africa.\r\nTo stimulate international efforts to that end,\r\nJapan hosted the Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development (TICAD) in 1993 and 1998. My\r\ndelegation is confident that this process played a\r\npivotal role in shifting the attention of the international\r\ncommunity back to Africa.\r\nIn the TICAD process, Japan has promoted the\r\nprinciples of ownership and global partnership. As\r\nstated in the Tokyo Agenda for Action adopted at\r\nTICAD II, economic and social development priorities\r\nshould be determined by African countries and\r\ndevelopment should be pursued under a common\r\nframework for cooperation among all development\r\nactors.\r\nIt is from this point of view that Japan welcomes\r\nthe adoption of the New African Initiative, now\r\nrenamed the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). In the document describing\r\nthe New Partnership, African leaders upheld the\r\nprinciple of ownership. They proclaimed that “We will\r\ndetermine our own destiny and call on the world to\r\ncomplement our efforts”, and stressed their\r\ndetermination to meet preconditions for development,\r\nsuch as peace, security, democracy, good governance\r\nand sound economic management. In this regard,\r\nNEPAD has key elements in common with TICAD. My\r\nGovernment looks forward to discussing how the\r\ninternational community can be of help in\r\nimplementing NEPAD at the TICAD ministerial-level\r\nmeeting that Japan will host next month in preparation\r\nfor TICAD III.\r\nDuring the last decade, the United Nations made\r\nefforts to promote African development through the\r\nadoption and implementation of its New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF)\r\nas a framework for that purpose. In the TICAD\r\nprocess, for example, UN-NADAF was taken into\r\nconsideration in connection with the pursuit of further\r\npolitical and economic reform in African countries, as\r\nstated in the Tokyo Declaration adopted at TICAD I.\r\nUpon the adoption of NEPAD, however, the\r\nUnited Nations should pay more attention to African\r\nleaders’ own development agenda, outlined in the\r\ndocument. In this regard, in the forthcoming review\r\nand appraisal of the implementation of UN-NADAF,\r\nwe should examine how the United Nations can best\r\nhelp African countries to translate NEPAD into\r\nconcrete national policies. My delegation will actively\r\nparticipate in such discussions.\r\nMr. Niang (Senegal) (spoke in French): Ten\r\nyears ago, during the forty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, the African continent, through the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s, committed itself, together with the\r\ninternational community, in a political and moral\r\ncontract in which the responsibility of each party was\r\nclearly defined in the form of specific commitments.\r\nNow that it is time to assess the impact of this contract\r\non the situation in Africa, I would like to share with the\r\nAssembly a few thoughts that, in light of the success\r\nachieved and the difficulties met, might perhaps help\r\nus to see what the way forward should be.\r\nOver the last 10 years, Africa has not been able to\r\nfulfil all its commitments, but it has engaged in several\r\ninitiatives. Far-reaching economic reform was\r\nundertaken in many countries, aimed, for instance, at\r\nmore thrifty and transparent public resource\r\nmanagement. Broadening the tax base in order to\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nprovide enough public sector investment has been one\r\nof the priorities, and this is the reason for the many\r\nprivatizations of public and semi-public companies on\r\nthe continent, and the termination of trading systems\r\nbased on exceptions and preferences.\r\nReform has also spread to the private sector with\r\nderegulation of the labour market, which many\r\ncountries have undertaken. This has meant more\r\nflexibility and creates a more welcoming climate for\r\nforeign investment by rationalizing and reforming laws\r\non investment. These measures aimed at reforming the\r\npublic sector and at promoting the private sector have\r\nenabled the continent over the course of the last 10\r\nyears to register constantly rising average growth rates.\r\nAs far as political and institutional life is\r\nconcerned, free and democratic elections have taken\r\nplace in many countries throughout the 1990s. There\r\nhave been many transfers of power, among which was\r\nthe memorable election in Senegal on 19 March 2001.\r\nDespite the fact that there have been certain problems\r\nand setbacks, the democratic renaissance on the\r\ncontinent is here to stay, with freedom of expression,\r\nfreedom of choice and respect for human rights and\r\nliberties firmly part of our mindset.\r\nThis political and institutional change has\r\naccompanied the establishment of independent legal\r\nsystems, a more independent press, more non-\r\ngovernmental organizations that are increasingly\r\ncommitted. The new dynamic in Africa has helped to\r\nreduce political instability, which was so characteristic\r\nof the continent at the beginning of 1990s.\r\nWith regard to the training of human resources,\r\nthe significant efforts of African countries in the areas\r\nof basic education and adult literacy have enabled real,\r\nif modest, progress. Furthermore, the Dakar\r\nFramework for Action on Education for All, held in\r\nDakar in April 2000, prepared the way for reaching the\r\ngoal of widespread access to education by 2015.\r\nThese initiatives have, as a whole, had some\r\npositive effects. But we must acknowledge that\r\nAfrica’s grave economic situation, which led to the\r\ncreation in 1990 of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa, has not improved.\r\nThe report of the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development (UNCTAD) published last\r\nSeptember, entitled, “Economic Development in\r\nAfrica: Performance, Prospects and Policy Issues”\r\nleaves no room for disagreement on this point. It notes\r\nthat in 2000, the per capita income in Africa is 10 per\r\ncent below the level reached in 1980. The report goes\r\non to say that, even though agricultural output has\r\nincreased slightly in recent years, 28 million Africans\r\nare facing severe food shortages in 2001. If that is the\r\ncase, it is because the international community’s\r\nsupport for Africa, though effective, is still insufficient\r\nin many areas.\r\nDespite the effort of African countries to reform\r\ntheir trade policies, it has been difficult for them to\r\ngain access to the markets of developed countries\r\nbecause of prohibitive tariffs and other non-tariff\r\nbarriers. In this regard, we should welcome certain\r\nrecent initiatives such as the African Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act of the United States and the\r\n“Everything but arms” initiative of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nAs well, the mobilization of financial resources\r\nfor investment in Africa has been very much below the\r\ntargets set, bearing in mind the continuing drop in\r\nofficial development assistance and Africa’s meagre\r\nshare of global foreign direct investment flows.\r\nWith regard to heavy foreign debt loads and the\r\ncomprehensive measures taken by the international\r\ncommunity, I would like to speak of two initiatives\r\nassisting highly indebted poor countries, which shows\r\nthat there is a will to remove the burden weighing\r\ndown African economies, though these measures have\r\nso far proven to be ineffective.\r\nThe difficulties we have seen in implementing the\r\ngoals of the New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica has led African leaders to undertake a new joint\r\napproach: the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. We are all aware of the various aspects\r\nof this new partnership. I only revisit them to stress\r\nthat it is based on our leaders’ clear understanding that\r\nAfrican development is first and foremost the\r\nresponsibility of Africans. The Partnership defines the\r\npreconditions necessary for development, identify the\r\npriorities in each sector and formulate a strategy for\r\nmobilizing resources.\r\nThis new partnership heralds the choice of a new\r\napproach to economic development and has been well\r\nreceived by the Economic and Social Council, the G-8\r\ncountries, the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nWith this in mind, I will conclude by expressing\r\nthe wish that the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment should be the foundation for a new act of\r\nfaith that Africa and the international community must\r\nbuild in order to work together at the start of the new\r\nmillennium so that African peoples may finally reap\r\nthe benefits of globalization.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): When looking at the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, we should not be totally blinded\r\nby the apparent lack of success as demonstrated by the\r\ndeterioration in the economic and social development\r\nof the African continent and its increased\r\nmarginalization over the last 10 years. There are many\r\nstatistics that can be recited to prove the declining\r\nsituation of Africa. However, we believe that a careful\r\nevaluation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s will provide us\r\nwith valuable lessons on the achievements that we need\r\nto build upon and the shortcomings that we need not\r\nrepeat, as well as the dangers and pitfalls that we need\r\nto avoid in the future. These could be most useful as\r\nwe are charting our own course forward in the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWhat is already apparent is the contribution that\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa has made towards creating a system-wide\r\nawareness of Africa during the 1990s. This was borne\r\nout by the regular references to the particular needs of\r\nAfrica in United Nations summits and conferences, in\r\ndecisions and resolutions, throughout the United\r\nNations system and in reports by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. These reached their climax in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, when all our heads of State and\r\nGovernment recognized the special challenges faced by\r\nour African continent.\r\nMy delegation is looking forward to the report by\r\nthe Panel of Eminent Personalities and their\r\nindependent, high-level, quality evaluation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica. We also stand ready to assist them and the\r\nconsultants supporting their work in any way possible.\r\nWe fully support the suggestion by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council in its agreed conclusions of 1999 that\r\nthe review should focus not solely on the New Agenda\r\nbut also consider its relationship with other initiatives.\r\nWhile the review would obviously consider the\r\npriorities that shape the New Agenda, it should also\r\nevaluate the impact of unforeseen challenges that has\r\ndeveloped in subsequent years, such as the impact of\r\nglobalization, the digital divide and the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. The Economic and Social Council also\r\nrequested recommendations for future action, including\r\nthe consideration of successor arrangements. At the\r\ntime that the Economic and Social Council made these\r\nrequests, there was, of course, no clarity on what such\r\na successor arrangement could be.\r\nThe situation has now changed dramatically as\r\nAfrica has presented its own successor to the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa:\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), formerly known as the New African\r\nInitiative. The discussion on future action and the\r\nsuccessor arrangements need not consider what would\r\nreplace the New Agenda for the Development of Africa\r\nbut merely how the United Nations should support this\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development and how it\r\nwould reprioritize its own programmes and other\r\nengagements in the continent in accordance with the\r\npriorities, objectives and programmes of this new\r\npartnership.\r\nIn preparing the new partnership, Africa gave\r\nserious thought to the fundamental questions\r\nunderlying the problem of the already huge and\r\ngrowing disparities in development between the North\r\nand the South and the persistence of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment on our continent. However, one of\r\nthe most important preconditions for the effective\r\nrenewal of the continent was achieved only in the\r\nmiddle of the 1990s, when, with the abolition of\r\napartheid, we finally reached the complete liberation of\r\nthe peoples of the continent.\r\nFurthermore, we Africans, including our leaders,\r\narrived at a common perspective that democracy is\r\nfundamental to the regeneration of our countries and\r\nthe continent. The renaissance of the continent is now\r\npossible as many of our people in Africa came to the\r\ncommon determination that adherence to good\r\neconomic governance aimed at the emancipation of our\r\npeople from poverty is as important as political\r\ndemocracy. We have further resolved to improve the\r\nliving conditions of our people by finding ways to use\r\nour natural resources better, instead of these riches\r\nbenefiting outsiders and a small elite.\r\nThe renewal of Africa is furthermore made\r\npossible because the masses will be involved. In all\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\ntheir forms and from their different stations in life, all\r\ncitizens of the African continent will have critical and\r\nspecific roles to play and contributions to make to\r\nensure the revitalization of our continent. With this, the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development is creating\r\ntrue ownership and thereby closing the ownership\r\ndebate as far as it relates to Africa.\r\nThe main objective of the New Partnership is the\r\neradication of poverty on the continent, and all our\r\nactions, as well as the support we will seek, should\r\ncontribute towards that goal. The New Partnership\r\nfurther seeks to place African countries on a path of\r\nsustainable growth and development and thereby halt\r\nthe marginalization of the continent in the globalization\r\nprocess. We have realized that there is much that we as\r\nAfrican countries could do and should commit\r\nourselves to.\r\nIn this regard, we are agreed that we must\r\nstrengthen democracy on the continent, change the\r\nhuman rights culture, end existing conflicts and prevent\r\nnew ones, deal with corruption and be accountable to\r\none another for all our actions. These are important\r\nfirst and foremost for the well-being of our own\r\npeople, but will also create positive conditions for\r\ninvestment — both domestic and foreign — economic\r\ngrowth and development. We have hereby effectively\r\nreversed the conditionality debate.\r\nWe also believe that the advent of the African\r\nUnion will contribute significantly to the continent’s\r\nability to address the political issues just mentioned\r\nand to create the peace, stability and security that we\r\nall seek. Africa has also determined its own priority\r\nsectors to be focused on in order to achieve our own\r\noverall goals. These entail bridging gaps in the\r\nphysical, structural, organizational and information and\r\ncommunication technology infrastructures; the transfer\r\nof technology to eliminate the digital divide; the\r\npromotion of human development, particularly in the\r\nareas of health, education and culture; the development\r\nof agriculture; the promotion of diversification in\r\nproduction and exports; and the granting of improved\r\nmarket access. We are, however, realistic enough to\r\nrecognize that our own efforts, however determined,\r\nwill not be sufficient and will need to be complemented\r\nby actions and support of the international community\r\nin true partnership.\r\nWe are thus confident about the renaissance of\r\nthe African continent through the implementation of\r\nthe New Partnership, as this is based on a new\r\npartnership with the international community on the\r\nbasis of what we as Africans have determined to be the\r\ncorrect route to our own development. The New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development states very\r\nclearly in paragraph 6 that mobilizing the necessary\r\nresources and achieving the developmental goals\r\ncontained in this new partnership requires “a new\r\nglobal partnership based on shared responsibility and\r\nmutual interest”. It goes further, however, and states\r\nthat, in this regard, we are not asking for favours, but\r\nfor fairness and justice, a better life for Africans and a\r\nsecure future for all humanity. We are thus far\r\nencouraged by the support that this initiative has\r\nalready received from the Group of Eight industrialized\r\ncountries, the European Union and other developed\r\ncountries; in the United Nations, the endorsement by\r\nMember States in the high-level Ministerial\r\nDeclaration of the Economic and Social Council and in\r\nthe open-ended Working Group on the Causes of\r\nConflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and\r\nSustainable Development in Africa is also greatly\r\nappreciated. The statements of support made by the\r\nSecretary-General and the decision by the\r\nAdministrative Committee on Coordination in April to\r\nsupport African-led and African-owned development\r\nplans, such as those culminating in the New\r\nPartnership, committed the whole United Nations\r\nsystem to this same goal.\r\nWhat has been particularly encouraging to my\r\ndelegation is the unflinching support that we have\r\nreceived from other delegations of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina in our efforts to promote this partnership and its\r\npriorities, objectives and programmes within this\r\nOrganization. Their solidarity with Africa is noted and\r\nmuch appreciated. With this kind of support and\r\nthrough true partnerships we are confident that Africa\r\nwill be able to confront and overcome the challenges\r\nthat face us.\r\nBut the partnerships envisaged in this New\r\nPartnership do not only involve Governments and other\r\nofficial bodies. It also stresses the need to strengthen\r\npublic-private partnerships. These can play particularly\r\nimportant roles in generating resources, promoting\r\nskills development and technology transfer and\r\nimplementing infrastructure and social programmes.\r\nIn reviewing the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and in\r\nconsidering its successor arrangement, we Africans\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nthus have to consider how the United Nations would\r\nengage with Africa according to the priorities,\r\nobjectives and programmes of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): At the outset, let me\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his note contained in document A/56/270.\r\nWhile the final review of the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s will be conducted in the year 2002,\r\nmy delegation nevertheless wishes to make brief\r\ncomments on the note before us.\r\nAs clearly stated in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, the Assembly, in taking stock of the\r\nachievements made by African countries, as well as the\r\ncomplementary efforts made by the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations system in\r\nparticular, should provide guidelines for future actions.\r\nIn this context, the period between this session and the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly gives us\r\nample time to seriously consider how to complement\r\nsustainable development efforts of African countries.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation emphasizes the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s decision that the final review and\r\nappraisal should include a thorough review of existing\r\ninitiatives on Africa. This is important, for it\r\ncomplements the central objective of the final review.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the Panel to\r\noversee the evaluation of the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica, and it is also my delegation’s hope that the\r\nevaluation results will be submitted to the Assembly as\r\nplanned.\r\nThe United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa was based on the United\r\nNations Programme of Action for African Economic\r\nRecovery and Development. Both plans were based on\r\nAfrica’s priority programmes, and the latter was\r\nprepared by the Conference of Ministers of the\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa.\r\nSimilarly, at its recent summit, the Assembly of\r\nHeads of State and Government of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) adopted the New African\r\nInitiative, now known as the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development. Indeed, as stated in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, through this Initiative\r\nAfrican countries are again assuming and reasserting\r\nownership of their development while redefining the\r\nterms and conditions of partnership with the\r\ninternational community.\r\nLet me emphasize that ownership of Africa’s\r\ndevelopment by African countries themselves should\r\nnot be used to leave Africa’s development to itself\r\nalone. Africa needs assistance and solidarity from the\r\ninternational community. History has shown that no\r\nnation or group of nations has emerged from the ashes\r\nof destruction and underdevelopment without the\r\nassistance of others.\r\nThus, in the process of putting together the\r\nevaluation, the panel should, among other things, look\r\nat the famous Marshall Plan, which was put in place to\r\nrebuild Europe, as well as the remarkable Alliance for\r\nProgress, which assisted Latin America to emerge from\r\neconomic and social strife and empowered it to face the\r\nfuture with confidence. These two examples are not\r\nunique and can be applied to hardships and\r\ndevelopment challenges Africa is confronting today.\r\nThe panel should therefore include specific and\r\nconcrete lessons learned from these programmes,\r\nwhich made them successful and which could be\r\napplied in the implementation of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development.\r\nIn addition, lessons learned from the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations System-wide\r\nInitiative on Africa and all other initiatives should be\r\ntaken into account. Similarly, the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa,\r\nin our view, will also make a meaningful contribution\r\nto the final review.\r\nWhen the Secretary-General addressed the high-\r\nlevel segment of the Economic and Social Council this\r\nyear, he stressed “the need to put an end to the\r\nmultiplicity of initiatives on Africa.” (A/56/270,\r\npara. 9) Namibia concurs with this view. It is against\r\nthis background that the New Initiative undertaken by\r\nAfrican countries is comprehensive in nature,\r\ncomprising all aspects of development.\r\nSoon the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s will come to an\r\nend. A successor programme will be needed. In this\r\ncontext, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\ndeserves the full support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nWe support the recommendation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole carry\r\nout the final review and appraisal of the New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa and to submit its report\r\nto the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. In\r\nthis context, we count on the support of all Member\r\nStates for the draft resolution to be presented by the\r\nAfrican Group of States.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): The United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF) should be considered one of\r\nthe most important initiatives of the United Nations.\r\nThis is so not because it is about and for Africa, a\r\nmajor focus of the work of our Organization, but\r\nbecause, as a framework, UN-NADAF embodied in\r\none initiative the commitments which the international\r\ncommunity had made at the major United Nations\r\nconferences as well as through other multilateral and\r\nbilateral arrangements.\r\nThe opportunity to begin the review and appraisal\r\nof the implementation of UN-NADAF offers all of us a\r\nrare chance to evaluate our performance in meeting\r\nconcrete goals of development, measured against\r\ncommitments. In addition, this review process\r\nrepresents a concrete manifestation of the coordinated\r\nfollow-up required to address the outcomes of the\r\nmajor summits and conference, even if limited in this\r\ncase to Africa.\r\nIn this connection, we are satisfied with the steps\r\ntaken so far by the Secretary-General to launch the\r\nprocess. The panel of eminent personalities and the\r\nconsultants, who have already begun field-level\r\nevaluation, being independent of both the General\r\nAssembly and the Secretariat, will, hopefully be able to\r\npresent an undistorted picture of the state of\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF for our consideration.\r\nIt may turn out that our debate today, in preceding\r\nthe initial contacts planned by the panel of eminent\r\npersonalities, will contribute an important dimension of\r\nthe picture that is needed in order to arrive at a\r\nbalanced perspective and conclusion. My delegation\r\nexpects the panel, in undertaking its work, to tap\r\ninformation from all sources and to focus strongly on\r\nlessons learned to guide its recommendations for the\r\nfuture.\r\nIt is particularly important that, as Member\r\nStates, we avoid the futile exercises of the past, where\r\ndebate was reduced to talking past each other, with\r\nclaims and counter-claims regarding which side met its\r\nresponsibilities and commitments. The stakes in Africa\r\nare just too high for such an indulgence and sterile\r\ndebate.\r\nIn our view, Africa’s analysis of its situation,\r\ncontained in the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), should be the last word on the\r\nmatter. We should have the courage to stand by our\r\nconviction and admit that the failure of structural\r\nadjustment programmes and the absence of just and fair\r\nglobal rules may have contributed to the\r\nmarginalization of Africa, but the failures of political\r\nand economic leadership in many African countries\r\nhave also been to blame for Africa’s condition.\r\nIn the context of UN-NADAF, we believe it is\r\ntrue that what Africa managed to do, in spite of its\r\nfailures, was not matched in terms of the commitments\r\nmade by the international community. Any new\r\npartnership between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity will have to be built on Africa’s new and\r\ndetermined initiative for its development and a new\r\nrelationship of partnership between it and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn order to respond to NEPAD in a supportive\r\nway, the new partnership would need to address many\r\nof the problems which we expect the evaluation of UN-\r\nNADAF to highlight.\r\nThese include the distortive nature of economic\r\nreform processes in which macroeconomic policies\r\nimpact negatively on the social sector and destabilize\r\nthe social order; policy failures caused by ill-\r\nconsidered liberalization, inter alia, the lack of\r\ncoherence between financial, monetary and trade\r\npolicies, as exemplified in the failure to sustain gains\r\nfrom debt relief in the absence of fair market access for\r\nagricultural products from Africa; the inadequate\r\nsupport for addressing supply rigidities and\r\ndiversifying the economic base; the inadequate support\r\nfor capacity-building; the distortive role of external\r\nfactors in regional integration processes in Africa; and\r\nthe nature of the process within the United Nations,\r\nwhich tends to treat conflict and post-conflict issues as\r\nseparate from economic development.\r\nMr. Baialinov (Kyrgyzstan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThere are other factors, but it is not our intention\r\nto go into the details of those issues, particularly since\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nwe shall have an opportunity to do that during the\r\nreview in 2002. In our view, NEPAD — with its\r\nanalytical perspective and discerning conclusions on\r\nnational responsibilities and ownership, international\r\nenabling environments and mechanisms for\r\nimplementation — serves as a reference framework for\r\nany evaluation of past and future initiatives related to\r\nAfrica.\r\nPerhaps one of the questions to be answered in\r\nthe evaluation goes beyond Africa and the United\r\nNations. This is the issue of the perception of\r\ninitiatives drawn up in the United Nations. The\r\nSecretary-General made reference to this at the 2001\r\nhigh-level segment of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Unlike NEPAD, UN-NADAF did not create,\r\nor gain, a compelling momentum, and may have been\r\nseen as a bureaucratic product.\r\nIt may be argued that the attractiveness of\r\nNEPAD lies in its ownership by Africans themselves,\r\nwhile in the case of UN-NADAF, its apparent lack of\r\nownership might have been its biggest failing. Was it\r\nowned by the United Nations or by the international\r\ncommunity, or were they both owners? There is no\r\nevidence that UN-NADAF was considered the new\r\nagenda for Africa at the bilateral level, in the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions or in the World Trade Organization.\r\nIt is no wonder that, in that nebulous vacuum,\r\naccountability, or joint accountability, was such an\r\nelusive concept.\r\nIt may seem, therefore, that any new successor\r\narrangement should incorporate the international\r\ncommunity’s response, in terms of support to NEPAD,\r\nand should identify precisely the role and\r\nresponsibilities of each segment of the international\r\ncommunity. In this regard, we note that under NEPAD,\r\ntask teams and lead agencies are to be tasked with\r\npreparing specific, implementable, capacity-building\r\nprojects and programmes on peace and security,\r\neconomic and corporate governance, infrastructure,\r\ncentral banking and financial standards and agriculture\r\nand market access. That response should be based on\r\nclear benchmarks and targets and should be structured\r\nwithin a coherent and precise mechanism that is open\r\nto evaluation and accountability, involving, jointly,\r\nAfrican countries, donors — both bilateral and\r\nmultilateral — and the United Nations system.\r\nIn this regard, the work on indicators already\r\nbegun in the United Nations is crucial and needs to be\r\naccelerated. We also expect that a new framework,\r\nincorporating all aspects of United Nations processes\r\nrelevant to NEPAD, will ensure an integrated United\r\nNations approach to Africa — an objective still mired\r\nin institutional turf-minding.\r\nI would like to say a few words on the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals for the final review and\r\nappraisal of UN-NADAF next year. My delegation\r\nsupports the proposal for an ad hoc committee of the\r\nwhole. We believe that such a committee should devote\r\npart of its substantive session, in the days immediately\r\npreceding the general debate at the fifty-seventh\r\nsession, to considering how to support NEPAD in the\r\ncontext of the successor programme for UN-NADAF. It\r\nis our hope that Member States will be represented at\r\nthat session at a high level.\r\nWe are hopeful that the new spirit of leadership\r\nand ownership demonstrated by Africa’s leaders and\r\npeople, and the sense of partnership engendered by\r\nNEPAD, will lead to convergence in actions that will\r\nenable Africa to achieve its development objectives.\r\nMr. Choi Seok-young (Republic of Korea): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on the final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nFor the past 10 years, the New Agenda has\r\npromoted the transformation, integration,\r\ndiversification and growth of the African economies in\r\norder to reduce their vulnerabilities and increase their\r\ndynamism. The international community has made\r\ntireless efforts to address the vicious cycle of abject\r\npoverty and frustrating regional conflicts. The special\r\nneeds of Africa have been recognized in major United\r\nNations initiatives and conferences and, in particular,\r\nat the Millennium Summit held last year.\r\nHowever, addressing the wide spectrum of socio-\r\neconomic and political issues affecting Africa, which\r\nhas been afflicted with conflict, poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment, has become one of the greatest\r\nglobal challenges. The annual growth of the gross\r\ndomestic product in Africa has been less than 3 per\r\ncent for the past four years. Furthermore, the continent\r\nsuffers from dwindling external financial resources,\r\ndebt hangover, the HIV/AIDs pandemic and sporadic\r\narmed conflict.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nAs we are all aware, the United Nations is\r\nuniquely positioned to coordinate activities for meeting\r\nthe desperate needs in Africa, and it possesses a\r\ncomparative advantage in dealing with the global\r\nagenda regarding Africa. Throughout the development\r\nprocess in Africa, the important findings that peace,\r\ndemocracy and good governance are a prerequisite for\r\nsustainable development there, and that comprehensive\r\nstrategies need to be developed to address the root\r\ncauses of conflict, were repeatedly reconfirmed.\r\nThe most remarkable recent progress in the\r\nAfrican development process was the adoption of the\r\nNew African Initiative, which was designed and\r\ndeveloped by African countries themselves. My\r\ndelegation would like to commend the bold political\r\ncommitments of the African leaders, who placed great\r\nemphasis on peace, security, good governance and\r\nsound economic management as preconditions for\r\nsustainable development.\r\nNext year, we will devote ourselves to the\r\nappraisal of UN-NADAF through an ad hoc committee\r\nof the whole, if it is established. My delegation would\r\nlike to highlight several points with regard to this\r\nprocess.\r\nFirst, one of the unprecedented factors affecting\r\nthe implementation of the New Agenda is the rapid\r\nprocess of globalization. Globalization has presented\r\nnew challenges with significant socio-economic,\r\npolitical and institutional ramifications, and far-\r\nreaching implications for development paths\r\nthroughout the world. The review and appraisal of UN-\r\nNADAF should be made against the backdrop of this\r\nchanging world.\r\nSecondly, the international community, including\r\nthe United Nations, needs to make a great effort in\r\nsupport of the New African Initiative, which has now\r\nbeen renamed NEPAD. It is encouraging that the G-8,\r\nat its summit held last July, agreed to launch a detailed\r\ndevelopment plan for Africa and to set up a panel with\r\na number of African leaders. I hope the United Nations\r\nsystem will also adopt a coherent approach in support\r\nof such initiatives for the years to come.\r\nThirdly, new avenues for mobilizing additional\r\nresources and promoting exports of African products\r\nneed to be explored. Despite a number of initiatives by\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes, as well as other\r\nUnited Nations agencies, it is discouraging to note the\r\nhuge gap between the level of financial resources\r\nneeded for development and the inflows made\r\navailable to meet those needs. I share the view that a\r\npositive external environment regarding resource flows\r\ndoes not automatically translate into self-sustained\r\ngrowth. Efforts should also be made at the domestic\r\nlevel.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has made great efforts to\r\nshare its development experiences with other\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular with African\r\ncountries. Last year, we trained a number of African\r\nexperts in the field of export promotion, in close\r\ncooperation with the Office of the Special Coordinator\r\nfor Africa and the least developed countries. By the\r\nend of this year, the number of invited trainees from\r\nthe least developed countries, including the majority of\r\nAfrican countries, will number over 3,000.\r\nIn the area of market access, at the beginning of\r\nthis year we removed tariffs on 80 commodities of\r\nmajor export interest to the least developed countries.\r\nFurthermore, the Republic of Korea also contributed\r\n$300,000 to the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nsecretariat to support trade-related capacity-building in\r\nthe least developed countries. We have also contributed\r\nto several facilities of the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nincluding the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)\r\nDebt Initiative trust fund.\r\nFinally, 2002 will be an important year for\r\naddressing the issues of development and poverty\r\neradication, as we will have two important\r\ninternational conferences — the Monterrey Conference\r\nand the Johannesburg Summit. In this context, it is\r\nimportant to take stock of the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa, with a view to designing\r\nnew development strategies for Africa. The Republic of\r\nKorea will join in the international efforts for African\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. El Atrash (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): Allow me at the outset to express our\r\nthanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General and to\r\nhis staff for the preparation and presentation of the\r\nreport on the final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. This is a\r\ncomprehensive report that gives a clear and accurate\r\npicture of the recent economic performance of the\r\ncontinent and of the factors affecting its potential for\r\ngrowth. It contains analyses and conclusions\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nconcerning major issues related to both international\r\nand domestic economic policies, which affect and\r\ninfluence the growth process.\r\nAll of us — particularly those of us who are\r\nAfricans — are cognizant of the importance of the\r\nquestion under consideration — the final review and\r\nappraisal of the implementation of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda. We are also aware of the fact that\r\nconsideration of this matter, by highlighting the various\r\nsocial and economic consequences in African countries\r\nand the extent to which it has kept promises of\r\nprosperity for the peoples of Africa, will enable us to\r\ndetermine to what degree it has succeeded or failed in\r\nalleviating poverty in the continent.\r\nAs is well known, the United Nations New\r\nAgenda was launched with the goal of integrating\r\nAfrica into the world economy, alleviating poverty and\r\nputting Africa on the path to sustainable growth with\r\nthe support of the international community.\r\nNevertheless, it is regrettable that, despite the\r\nunprecedented global wealth and the mind-boggling\r\nprogress made in the field of science and technology,\r\nthe results, for Africa, have been disappointing. At a\r\ntime when the industrialized world has witnessed truly\r\nunprecedented economic growth and the creation of\r\ntremendous national wealth, the suffering of the\r\nAfrican countries from poverty and underdevelopment\r\ncontinues to increase. Poverty is one of the greatest\r\nchallenges facing Africa. Poverty in African manifests\r\nitself in various forms and pertains to a great number of\r\nquestions related to the multiple aspects of socio-\r\neconomic development.\r\nThe African countries have shouldered, to the\r\nextent possible, their responsibilities for the\r\ndevelopment of the continent. This is evident in the\r\nProgramme of Action for African Recovery and the\r\nOmega plan, which were incorporated into the New\r\nAfrican Initiative at the recently held Lusaka summit.\r\nWe welcome the modest increase in the resources\r\ndevoted to Africa in the regular budget of the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD). The analysis contained in the document\r\nreflects current realities in the African continent,\r\nshowing that the development achieved during the past\r\ndecade was neither significant nor meaningful. The\r\ndecline in international flows of resources, particularly\r\nfinancial assistance for development, was one of the\r\nmost important factors and causes of the deepening of\r\nAfrica’s suffering.\r\nOfficial development assistance greatly declined\r\nin the 1990s, from $26.7 million in 1991 to $20.7\r\nmillion in 1995, and decreased further to $17.1 million\r\nin 1998. The decrease in international resource flows,\r\nparticularly official development assistance, and the\r\ndeteriorating terms of trade have hindered Africa’s\r\neffective participation in international trade and have\r\ncut its share of the global market to less than 2 per\r\ncent.\r\nThis has resulted in the marginalization of Africa\r\nin the area of international trade and investment as well\r\nas the deterioration of the market for the commodities\r\nand raw materials exported by the countries of the\r\nregion. In addition, its weak infrastructure and\r\ndeteriorating social services, as well as the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria and tuberculosis epidemics\r\nin some parts of Africa, and the crushing burden of\r\nforeign debt, unemployment, natural disasters, wars\r\nand armed conflict all have contributed to increased\r\npoverty in Africa and to the continent’s marginalization\r\nand inability to achieve the goals of the New African\r\nInitiative.\r\nThe analyses and conclusions contained in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General and other documents\r\nproduced by UNCTAD make it abundantly clear that it\r\nwill be nearly impossible to change the deteriorating\r\neconomic situation in Africa without a drastic change\r\nin both domestic and international policies.\r\nHere my delegation would like to stress the need\r\nfor the international community to shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities. The international community is\r\nresponsible for ensuring coherence and harmony\r\nbetween domestic and international policies.\r\nInternational measures have a considerable influence\r\non the external conditions Africa is facing as well as on\r\ndomestic conditions that are affected by foreign\r\npolicies, and on the adaptation processes that are\r\nenhanced by the Bretton Woods institutions. Therefore\r\nthe creation of an enabling international environment\r\nthat would make it possible to establish effective\r\ninternational cooperation will have a great impact on\r\nAfrica. Addressing the question of poverty and its\r\neradication is the collective responsibility of all States\r\nand therefore it is incumbent upon all of us to establish\r\nthe necessary international cooperation in this regard.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General reviews the\r\ndevelopment of Africa in the 1990s and analyses both\r\nthe external and internal obstacles to growth in Africa.\r\nThe report before us gives a clear picture, albeit a bleak\r\none, of the sub-Saharan African economy. We thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his praiseworthy efforts and for\r\nthose of the Secretariat in this respect.\r\nWhile reaffirming the importance of the efforts\r\nmade by the United Nations to support development\r\nand to eradicate poverty, my delegation continues to\r\nlook to the international community, in both its formal\r\nand informal sectors, to give priority to the\r\ndevelopment programmes of developing countries,\r\nespecially the African countries. We look forward to\r\nthe international community adopting swift and\r\ndecisive measures that would help the African\r\ncontinent to overcome the economic and social\r\nobstacles along its way to development.\r\nWe are convinced that the efforts of the United\r\nNations and the international community cannot be\r\nsuccessful without political will and the necessary\r\nresources to finance sustainable development in the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nThere are several measures proposed by my\r\ndelegation to help Africa overcome the obstacles to its\r\nsustainable development. These include, first,\r\nintegrating Africa into the world economy and enabling\r\nit to benefit from the globalization process, while\r\ntaking into account the specific situation and potential\r\nof countries that might not be in full harmony with the\r\nnew world order. This new world order must promote\r\ntrade and development for all.\r\nSecondly, measures should ensure an equitable\r\nand effective partnership between the developed\r\ncountries and the African countries in the adoption of\r\nfinancial and economic decisions through relevant\r\ninternational institutions. Thirdly, developed countries\r\nshould be urged to facilitate the transfer of technology\r\nto Africa, integrating it into the world information\r\nnetwork in a manner that would ensure the\r\ndevelopment and capacity-building of both private and\r\npublic institutions in this field. Fourthly, developed\r\ncountries should effectively, swiftly and seriously\r\nalleviate Africa’s crushing debt burden and help it\r\nterminate the problem once and for all. However this\r\nshould not take place at the expense of other official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nFinally, these measures should lead to the\r\nadoption of contingency plans to deal with possible\r\nexternal shocks. External factors may cause drastic\r\nchanges in the economic situation of these countries.\r\nAfrica recognizes its deteriorating economic\r\nsituation and how difficult it is to eradicate poverty and\r\nthe suffering of its people. It is aware of the widening\r\ngap between itself and the rich countries. The countries\r\nof the continent are gravely concerned at the lack of\r\nenthusiasm shown by their development partners. We\r\nbelieve that it is time to take immediate action to\r\nsupport developing countries through debt relief and\r\ncontinued financial resource flows to them.\r\nTherefore, my delegation supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations in his report that poverty\r\nalleviation programmes must be accompanied not only\r\nby increased resources but also by structural\r\nadjustment and macroeconomic policies to move the\r\ngrowth process forward and to improve the distribution\r\nof income. My delegation also reaffirms the need for\r\nthe United Nations system and the international\r\ncommunity to support the New African Initiative and to\r\ntake all necessary measures to ensure a coordinated and\r\neffective response by the United Nations to this\r\ninitiative.\r\nMy delegation expresses its gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his statement at the opening of\r\nthe high-level segment of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil on 16 July 2001, where he affirmed the full\r\nsupport of the United Nations for the New African\r\nInitiative. It was also stressed in a statement made on\r\nbehalf of the African Group in the high-level segment\r\nof the same body on 17 July 2001 that a review of the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF would afford an\r\nopportunity to evaluate the performance of the African\r\ncountries and the international support given to them\r\nduring the last decade. It would be an occasion to\r\ndetermine the future course of work for the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nincluding the reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by\r\nthe year 2015 in Africa.\r\nWe deem it necessary that UN-NADAF be\r\nreviewed and appraised in accordance with the\r\nmachinery suggested to the General Assembly in the\r\nnote by the Secretary-General in document A/56/270\r\nwith regard to establishing an ad hoc committee of the\r\nwhole at the fifty-sixth session that would be mandated\r\nto carry out a final review and appraisal of UN-\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nNADAF and submit its report to the Assembly at its\r\nfifty-seventh session, taking into account the report on\r\nthe evaluation of the implementation of UN-NADAF\r\nby the African Union and other relevant reports.\r\nWe are optimistic about the spirit of cooperation\r\nand action that permeates the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union, and we are fully confident that this will\r\nhave positive ramifications for the New African\r\nInitiative. We expect further serious steps and efforts in\r\nthis regard against such a promising backdrop.\r\nMr. Valero Paulino (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for submitting a wide range of reports which,\r\nboth in the plenary of the General Assembly and other\r\nbodies and committees of our Organization, have\r\nallowed us to gain a better understanding of the\r\ncomplex reality of the African continent.\r\nMy country — and, we are convinced, the\r\ninternational community as a whole — is deeply\r\nconcerned by the fact that the majority of the countries\r\nof the African continent are beginning the twenty-first\r\ncentury as the poorest, least developed and least\r\ntechnologically advanced countries in the world.\r\nDespite the fact that African countries have 18.5\r\nper cent of the world’s population, the region produces\r\nonly 3.5 per cent of the global gross domestic product\r\n(GDP) and represents only 1.5 per cent of global\r\nexports. Africa receives only two per cent of the global\r\nforeign direct investment and, in relation to its GDP, is\r\nthe most highly indebted region in the world. These\r\nfigures partly explain why the per capita income in\r\nAfrica has dropped from $749 per year in 1980 to $688\r\nin 1998.\r\nIn addition, conflicts, natural disasters and\r\nepidemics such as HIV/AIDS have had a grave effect\r\non the African population and have hampered the\r\ncontinent’s ability to attain the objectives of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. To reduce poverty by half by\r\nthe year 2015 in Africa, the continent’s economy would\r\nhave to grow by 5 per cent a year. That will be difficult\r\nto achieve, considering that — quite apart from the\r\npresent unusual world economic situation — the\r\naverage growth rate in Africa in the 1990s was only 2.1\r\nper cent per year. The region also faces problems\r\nincluding a weak private sector, low rates of savings,\r\nshortcomings in the management of public affairs,\r\nfragile financial systems, low public investment in\r\ninfrastructure and weak links between agriculture and\r\nindustry.\r\nThe final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s provides a\r\nvaluable opportunity to take stock of the outcome of\r\naction taken by African countries themselves and by\r\nthe international community to promote the\r\ndevelopment of Africa. My country welcomes the\r\nleadership role played by the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) and its decision to move towards new\r\nintegration mechanisms. The decision to establish the\r\nAfrican Union and the adoption of the New African\r\nInitiative are major steps that deserve the support of the\r\ninternational community and of the United Nations\r\nsystem. The adoption of measures to prevent conflict\r\nand to foster peace-building in Africa would constitute\r\nstrong support for such steps.\r\nMexico hopes that the establishment of a single\r\ncomprehensive framework for the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of Africa will enable the United Nations\r\nsystem and the international community to become part\r\nof this new global initiative to tackle the many\r\nchallenges facing the region, without duplication of\r\nefforts in a myriad of fragmented proposals and giving\r\nthe needed strategic direction to policies adopted by\r\nAfrican countries themselves in conformity with the\r\nobjectives of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nMy delegation is grateful to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his initiative to establish a panel composed\r\nof 12 independent personalities from Africa and the\r\ninternational community to oversee the evaluation of\r\nthe New Agenda. That evaluation will determine what\r\npaths we must follow in the future in order to set\r\nAfrica on the road to sustainable growth.\r\nMexico has supported the historic legitimate\r\nendeavours of the peoples of Africa to realize their\r\npolitical, economic and social demands. The\r\nAdministration of President Vicente Fox proposes to\r\nprovide new impetus for bilateral cooperation and to\r\nstrengthen multilateral efforts. To that end, President\r\nFox has pledged to participate in the 2002 summit\r\nmeeting of the Organization of African Unity, which\r\nwill make him the first Mexican President to take part\r\nin an African summit meeting. My delegation is\r\nconfident that President Fox will be able there to\r\nexamine with his African counterparts how Mexico can\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nparticipate in African initiatives in the sphere of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nBut before the OAU summit, Mexico looks\r\nforward to welcoming heads of State or Government\r\nfrom Africa who will be participating in the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment. My country is convinced that at\r\nMonterrey the international community will respond\r\nconstructively to efforts by African countries to\r\nachieve sustainable development in a climate of peace,\r\nequity and social justice.\r\nMr. Mmualefe (Botswana): In 2002 the General\r\nAssembly will conduct the final review of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF). Naturally, Botswana attaches\r\ngreat importance to the New Agenda review process,\r\nbecause the Agenda framework represents a unique\r\ncompact between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity, a compact founded on a commitment to the\r\ndevelopment of Africa and its peoples backed by\r\nconcrete action to realize the accelerated and sustained\r\neconomic and social development of the continent. The\r\nAssembly’s solidarity with Africa has been\r\ndemonstrated also by the articulation of the special\r\ndevelopment challenges of the region by all major\r\nUnited Nations conferences, including, very\r\nsignificantly, the Millennium Summit.\r\nIt is clear that, despite all good intentions, the\r\nNew Agenda is falling far short of expectations. That\r\ncomes as no surprise in view of the fact that the\r\nunderlying factors influencing development,\r\nparticularly mobilization of resources, have not been\r\nadequately addressed. I wish to highlight a few of those\r\nfundamental issues, which we deem critical to the\r\ndevelopment of Africa, as elaborated in Africa’s own\r\nblueprint for development: the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development, which was launched at the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) summit in\r\nLusaka in July 2001.\r\nFirst of all, the international community must\r\nsupport efforts towards peace and security in Africa.\r\nThe United Nations has the mandate, the means and the\r\nexpertise to assist in the resolution of armed conflict\r\nand thus to remove one of the major obstacles to\r\ndevelopment. That factor was clearly set out in the\r\nSecretary-General’s landmark 1998 report on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa (A/52/871).\r\nSecondly, African countries must be assisted in\r\ntheir efforts to ensure investment in human resource\r\ndevelopment, capacity-building and the acquisition and\r\napplication of technologies for development. In this era\r\nof phenomenal technological advancement, presenting\r\nreal possibilities for countries to stimulate domestic\r\ngrowth and infrastructure development and to unleash\r\nthe potential of both the private and the public sectors,\r\nit is crucial that all development partners step up\r\nefforts in a coherent manner to support Africa’s access\r\nto technology and also to bridge the digital divide.\r\nA third core issue, in our view, is the need to\r\nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. We cannot begin to\r\nhave any meaningful discussion on the development of\r\nAfrica unless we vigorously tackle HIV/AIDS in all its\r\naspects. Last June’s special session of the General\r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS underscored the urgency of\r\nthat issue; there the Assembly agreed on concrete\r\naction to be taken at both the domestic and the\r\ninternational levels. The international community and\r\nthe United Nations system should accelerate\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the special session\r\non HIV/AIDS in a sustained and properly targeted\r\nmanner.\r\nOther areas that have seriously hampered the full\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF are related to a paucity\r\nof financial resources and foreign direct investment to\r\nAfrica. This devastating trend occurred, and still\r\npersists, in spite of significant progress by African\r\nGovernments in the creation of sound economic,\r\npolitical, legal and governance frameworks necessary\r\nfor attracting official development assistance and\r\ninvestments.\r\nThe final review of UN-NADAF presents a\r\nunique opportunity for the system and the international\r\ncommunity to unite in support of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). In NEPAD, our\r\nleaders laid out the context of the new vision for Africa\r\nby making a clear and realistic assessment of the real\r\nsituation in the continent — which, sadly, is\r\ncharacterized by pervasive poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. This realistic and objective\r\nassessment augurs well for determined action in the\r\nright direction.\r\nAfrican leaders have laid down their own strategy\r\nfor economic revitalization of the continent, and we\r\nhope that this initiative will be supported by the\r\ninternational community through effective and\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nsustained implementation. The lessons learned from the\r\nevaluation and review of UN-NADAF will serve as\r\nvaluable tools to guide a more effective\r\nimplementation of NEPAD once its implementation\r\ncommittee has concluded its work on the various\r\nprogrammatic aspects of NEPAD.\r\nMy delegation awaits with great keenness a report\r\nof the Secretary-General on how the United Nations\r\nintends to assist in the implementation of NEPAD. We\r\nalso look forward to the convening of a high-level\r\nsubstantive session in September 2002, where the\r\nGeneral Assembly will consider how it should unite in\r\nsupport of an African-owned and African-led\r\nframework of action based on rationalization and a\r\nconcordance of its initiatives.\r\nBotswana has always emphasized that real and\r\nlasting development must be based on principles of\r\nownership. The priorities and destiny of the African\r\npeople can be truly determined by Africans themselves.\r\nThe adoption of NEPAD is testimony to this fact. We\r\nhope that the international community and the United\r\nNations system will continue their support for Africa’s\r\nagenda in a sustained, coherent and coordinated\r\nmanner.\r\nMr. De Loecker (Belgium) (spoke in French): I\r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the European\r\nUnion. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe\r\nassociated with the European Union — Bulgaria, the\r\nCzech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania,\r\nPoland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia — and the\r\nother associated countries, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey,\r\nendorse this statement.\r\nThe ministerial follow-up meeting to the Cairo\r\nSummit, which took place just a few weeks ago in\r\nBrussels, once again confirmed the will of the heads of\r\nState of the European Union countries and African\r\ncountries to work towards a new strategic dimension\r\nfor the global partnership between Africa and Europe.\r\nAfrica is indeed a priority for the Union, which is its\r\nprime source of funds and leading trading partner. The\r\nministerial meeting for a mid-term follow-up allowed\r\nus, among other things, to welcome the significant\r\ndegree of convergence accomplished in the priority\r\nareas identified within the framework of the follow-up\r\nto the Cairo Summit: conflict resolution, human rights,\r\ndemocracy and good governance, food security, AIDS,\r\nregional integration, the environment, debt and the\r\nreturn of cultural property. The results of that work will\r\nalso clearly be relevant to our deliberations here under\r\nthis agenda item.\r\nThe note by the Secretary-General invites us,\r\nabove all, to put in place a mechanism for the final\r\nreview and appraisal of the New Agenda in 2002, as\r\nwell as its juridical base. In this context, we welcome\r\nthe establishment by the Secretary-General of a panel\r\nof eminent personalities, and we are convinced that\r\ntheir evaluation will follow the criteria defined by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Regarding the review of the New\r\nAgenda by the General Assembly in 2002, the Union\r\nwould like to stress the importance of involving all\r\nstakeholders concerned, including governmental and\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector.\r\nIn his statement at the high-level segment of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council last July, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral clearly underlined the fact that the United\r\nNations system had been participating in so many\r\ndifferent development initiatives on Africa that he\r\ncould not remember the meaning of all the acronyms.\r\nHe added that, unfortunately, only a few of those\r\ninitiatives had been useful. The final review and\r\nappraisal of the New Agenda will give us an\r\nopportunity to consider the possibility of rationalizing\r\nthe many United Nations initiatives in order to reduce\r\nduplication and overlap, while maintaining the overall\r\nscope of agreed priorities and targets. In that effort to\r\nrationalize the number of United Nations initiatives,\r\nthe European Union will be guided by some basic\r\nprinciples that it has already put forward on other\r\noccasions. I will mention here the four most important.\r\nFirst and foremost is the importance of African\r\ncountries taking charge of their own development.\r\nThe second principle is the importance of an\r\nintegrated approach by, first, the United Nations\r\nsystem, and, secondly, by other partners from the\r\ninternational community and by African countries\r\nthemselves. The link established by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral between peace, democracy, human rights and\r\nsustainable development in his report (A/52/871) on\r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa has\r\nbecome a reference document for the European Union.\r\nThe third principle is the importance of a subtle\r\napproach, taking into account both the priority\r\nproblems shared by all African countries and the\r\nvarious situations and needs unique to each country in\r\nthe African region.\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nFinally, the fourth principle is the importance of a\r\nunited approach based on partnership in the most\r\ninclusive sense of the term. That spirit of partnership\r\nalready underlies the new Cotonou Agreement, the\r\nEuro-Mediterranean partnership and the action\r\nprogramme of the Africa-Europe summit in Cairo and\r\nits follow-up mechanism, as well as being the\r\nbackbone of the action programme for the least\r\ndeveloped countries that we adopted in Brussels.\r\nIt is a good omen that this exercise is taking place\r\nin the light of a new plan for the reconstruction of\r\nAfrica, coming from Africa itself. The New African\r\nInitiative, adopted by African heads of State at their\r\nrecent summit in Lusaka, clearly demonstrates that the\r\nAfrican countries are ready to take responsibility for\r\ntheir own development. In that context, we also\r\nwelcome the summit held in Abuja on 23 October,\r\nwhich made possible consolidation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and\r\nthe taking of a number of initial operational decisions.\r\nNot only does this represent an effort by Africa to\r\nsolve its own problems, but it is also an initiative with\r\nclear objectives and that recognizes democracy,\r\ntransparency, good governance, the rule of law and\r\nhuman rights as the fundamental elements of\r\ndevelopment. It is now up to all development partners\r\nto assist Africa in that effort. In this context, the\r\nEuropean Union welcomed the proposal to convene, on\r\nthe eve of the ministerial debate of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly, a debate on this new\r\npartnership.\r\nAt their meeting of 10 October, the European\r\nUnion and the heads of State of South Africa, Nigeria,\r\nSenegal, Algeria and Egypt expressed their firm\r\nresolve to establish links between the institutional\r\nframeworks of the New African Initiative and the\r\nEuropean Union and to develop a regular dialogue on\r\nthe development of the Initiative. For all these reasons,\r\nI can assure the General Assembly that the European\r\nUnion will be a committed and constructive partner\r\nthat will, above all, listen carefully to the arguments of\r\nthe delegations most concerned — the African\r\ndelegations. The economic reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment of Africa are and will remain a major\r\nissue for the European Union.\r\nMr. Johnson (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States delegation thanks the Secretary-General\r\nfor his note on the final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. We believe\r\nthat the initiatives recently taken by the African leaders\r\nto assume and assert ownership and to redefine the\r\nterms and conditions of their development will be\r\ninvaluable in directing the review of past efforts.\r\nLessons are to be learned from the past, but the\r\nemphasis must be on the future. African leaders\r\nunderstand that they carry the burden of alleviating\r\npoverty, diminishing the ravages of conflict and disease\r\nand stimulating economic growth in their countries.\r\nThe United States is committed to providing support.\r\nThe Human Development Report 2001 of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme shows that\r\nmuch progress has been made over the past 30 years,\r\ndue largely to technological breakthroughs in medicine,\r\nagriculture and employment — innovations made\r\npossible by supportive institutional and policy\r\nenvironments in a number of developing countries that\r\nempower human capital. More people than ever are\r\nenjoying the benefits of clean water, better health and\r\naccess to education.\r\nHowever, the report also shows that disease,\r\nespecially HIV/AIDS, and pervasive conflict are\r\nreversing some of these gains. Nearly 1 billion people\r\ndo not have access to safe drinking water; 11 million\r\nchildren below the age of five still die every year from\r\npreventable causes; 325 million children who should be\r\nin primary or secondary schools are not; and 1.2 billion\r\npeople still live on less than $1 a day. Too many of\r\nthese are in Africa.\r\nThe United States Government’s commitment to\r\nsupporting sustainable economic growth and\r\ndevelopment in Africa, accompanied by steady poverty\r\nreduction, was strongly endorsed by President Bush in\r\nhis speech to the African Growth and Opportunity\r\nForum recently held in Washington, D.C. The President\r\nexpressed his deep appreciation for the outpouring of\r\nsupport from African leaders and ordinary citizens\r\nalike following the events of 11 September. He\r\nreminded all foreign participants, including 35 African\r\nministers and ambassadors, and the United States\r\nSecretaries of State, the Treasury and Commerce that,\r\nin an era of global trade and global terror, the futures of\r\nthe developed world and the developing world are\r\nclosely linked.\r\nThe President drew a sharp contrast between\r\nleaders who fear human creativity, diversity and\r\nprogress, and who will therefore see the world pass\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nthem by, and those who respect the creativity and\r\nenterprise of their people, thereby enhancing their\r\naccess to social and economic progress. He welcomed\r\nand supported the New African Initiative, which so\r\nclearly embodies the resolve of visionary African\r\nleaders to provide the open and free societies that will\r\nallow their people to find new ways to create better and\r\nricher lives for themselves and their children.\r\nThe President emphasized that the vision of\r\nprogress is not owned by any nation or culture.\r\nCultures must preserve their unique values and good\r\ngovernance will look different from place to place.\r\nStill, there is a model of successful development.\r\nEverywhere, he pointed out — in the East and West,\r\nNorth and South — successful development occurs\r\nwhen a market economy trades with that part of the\r\nworld that respects human rights and the rule of law.\r\nAll the cases of successful development and sustained\r\neconomic growth over the past 40 years arose in\r\ncountries that relied on a market economy and opened\r\ntheir borders to greater trade and investment. In the\r\n1990s, developing countries that lowered trade barriers\r\nand expanded trade saw per capita income rise 5.1 per\r\ncent, compared to 1.9 per cent per-capita income\r\ngrowth in high-income countries. In contrast,\r\ndeveloping countries that did not make the same trade-\r\nliberalizing efforts suffered a decline in per-capita\r\nincome growth. No nation has entered the fast track of\r\ndevelopment without opening its economy to world\r\nmarkets.\r\nYet, while macroeconomic stability and an open\r\neconomy have proven essential for sustainable\r\ndevelopment growth, they are not sufficient in\r\nthemselves. The key to sustainable development lies\r\nwith the policies and institutions of each country’s\r\nGovernment, not in bilateral assistance programmes,\r\nWorld Bank programmes or United Nations\r\nprogrammes. All that external actors, donors,\r\ndevelopment partners and multilateral organizations\r\ncan do is provide support. The visionary leaders of\r\nAfrica understand this and have set an agenda that will\r\nshape Africa’s destiny through their own leadership,\r\ntheir own development initiatives and, most important,\r\ntheir solemn commitment to their people for a better\r\nlife.\r\nWe welcome their initiative and will continue our\r\nsupport through our multilateral and bilateral\r\ncontributions; through the United States Agency for\r\nInternational Development’s Global Development\r\nAlliance initiative; through our strong support for\r\nresponsible debt relief; through initiatives to improve\r\nbasic education and health services; and through\r\ninitiatives, such as the African Growth and Opportunity\r\nAct, which increased total trade with sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica by 17 per cent during the first half of this year,\r\nas compared to the same period the previous year.\r\nMr. Manalo (Philippines): Today’s debate is\r\nparticularly interesting and vibrant, as it shows how\r\nmuch progress can be achieved in the span of one year.\r\nIn the debate on this agenda item at the fifty-fifth\r\nsession, many of us contributed ideas on the various\r\nways and means to make development work for Africa,\r\nparticularly in the context of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF). Many of us spoke about helping Africa\r\nenhance its efforts for regional integration. Today, the\r\nproblems in Africa remain. The need for capacity-\r\nbuilding remains. Indeed, the need to further mobilize\r\nthe international community and its resources in\r\nsupport of African development remains.\r\nBut in my delegation’s view, the mood in Africa\r\nis different, for that great continent has seized its\r\ndestiny in its own hands and has charted a course that\r\nwill hopefully lead to an African renaissance. The road\r\nmap to accomplish this is the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) — and one important\r\nmodality is the emerging African Union. In this regard,\r\nwe wish the African Union the best at its first meeting,\r\nto take place next summer.\r\nOur task in this debate is therefore to enhance\r\nUnited Nations development efforts in Africa in order\r\nto complement Africa’s initiatives. In other words, we\r\nmust explore how multilateral efforts can contribute\r\nand complement the region’s efforts. The context could\r\nnot be better. The actual review of UN-NADAF will\r\ntake place next year — a year that has the potential of\r\nbeing the United Nations year of development. In 2002,\r\nmost, if not all, aspects of development will be\r\naddressed. In March, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey will\r\nhopefully result in a new consensus model of\r\ndevelopment that takes into account all sides of the\r\ndeveloping equation, including the needs and priorities\r\nof developing countries. In September, in\r\nJohannesburg, we will engage in our 10-year review of\r\nthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment\r\nand Development at the World Summit on Sustainable\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nDevelopment. It is fitting that our development year\r\nwill be capped in Africa.\r\nWhile we applaud Africa for the NEPAD\r\ninitiative and the transition from the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity to the important African Union, we also\r\nrecognize that many daunting challenges lie ahead. In\r\nmy own region, that of the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the road towards regional\r\neconomic integration has been filled with many\r\ndifficulties, and progress was at times slow. Yet the\r\nrecognition of common interests, and the realization\r\nthat we were better off working together rather than\r\nagainst each other, spurred ASEAN’s regional\r\neconomic integration. I believe that ASEAN’s relative\r\nsuccess could serve as a model to help Africa\r\novercome the challenges facing effective regional\r\ncooperation and integration. These include, among\r\nothers, the need for policy convergence and\r\nharmonization; inadequate financing, including\r\ndomestic investment and foreign direct investment;\r\ninstitutional capacity; and inadequate resources for\r\ndevelopment, including poverty eradication and\r\ncombating the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nWhen we take stock of UN-NADAF next year,\r\nwe can lay claim to one important success. As\r\nintended, we have helped to forge a greater, dynamic\r\npartnership between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity — as manifested by NEPAD — grounded\r\nin African ownership and playing its part in ending\r\npoverty and bringing about sustainable development.\r\nIndeed, the NEPAD initiative and the establishment of\r\nthe African Union demonstrate Africa’s intensification\r\nof its efforts to achieve better economic and political\r\nleadership. In that regard, the international community,\r\nparticularly our developed partners, should extend all\r\npossible assistance to African countries to strengthen\r\nkey institutions, such as the civil service, the judiciary,\r\nthe business sector and, of course, civil society.\r\nSouth-South cooperation can also play a pivotal\r\nrole and should therefore be vigorously promoted and\r\npursued. In this area, the Philippines can share its\r\nexperiences, including its positive and progressive\r\nrecord of Government partnership with all\r\nstakeholders, including the business sector and civil\r\nsociety.\r\nAt the same time, we need to focus on the\r\nfundamentals. African countries, particularly the most\r\neconomically vulnerable, must be fully integrated into\r\nthe global economy, not only in terms of meaningful\r\nparticipation in global economic decision-making and\r\nmarket access, but also in terms of building up their\r\ncapacity to enjoy the benefits of globalization. It is\r\nimperative that the flow of aid to the continent be\r\nstable and predictable. We therefore once again urge all\r\ndeveloped partners to meet the aid target of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product, and we commend those\r\nthat have done so. The international community must\r\nalso remain serious about debt relief. While we\r\nwelcome the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Initiative, we must also focus on meaningful\r\ndebt relief for all developing countries, especially those\r\nthat have made progress in putting their own house in\r\norder but still face heavy debt burdens.\r\nIn concluding, I wish to make just one point with\r\nregard to the modalities for undertaking the final\r\nreview and appraisal of UN-NADAF. We must conduct\r\nthe review in a holistic, integrated and forward-looking\r\nmanner, taking into account not only the various\r\ndimensions of development and the views of all\r\nstakeholders as appropriate but also the context in\r\nwhich the review will be taking place, namely, from the\r\nperspective of the UN-NADAF mid-term review, the\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, the Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco) (spoke in French): We\r\nwanted to contribute to the collective reflection on\r\ndevelopment in Africa by taking part in this discussion\r\non the final review and appraisal of the implementation\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nLike other speakers, I would like to stress the\r\nimportance of this review for the African continent.\r\nUN-NADAF was designed in the 1990s as a\r\nframework for international cooperation to promote\r\ndevelopment in the African continent. In the hope of\r\nproviding an effective remedy to the challenges of the\r\nlast century, African countries have made a real and\r\neffective commitment within the framework of this\r\nprogramme for the economic and social development\r\nof their continent. Despite their precarious social and\r\neconomic situation, Africans have made great efforts\r\nand undertaken wide-ranging programmes of\r\neconomic, political and institutional reform in order to\r\ncreate an internal environment conducive to economic\r\nrecovery and the development of partnerships with\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nboth developed countries and southern partners.\r\nDespite the reforms and efforts made at the national\r\nlevel, and despite the support of the international\r\ncommunity in implementing UN-NADAF, the\r\ninitiative, unfortunately, has not achieved the results\r\neveryone expected.\r\nAfrica still suffers from many ills and can be\r\nconsidered a disaster-stricken continent. The continent\r\nincludes three quarters of the least developed countries\r\nand two thirds of landlocked countries, almost all of\r\nwhich are constantly affected by recurring drought and\r\naccelerated desertification. The last report of the\r\nSecretary-General on poverty states that although\r\nprogress has been achieved in reaching the objective of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration to reduce poverty by half\r\nby 2015, in sub-Saharan Africa, by contrast, due to\r\nweak economic growth, the number of poor is steadily\r\nrising. Africa is now the region with the largest share\r\nof people living on less than $1 per day.\r\nPoverty, hunger and malnutrition affect many\r\nsectors of African society. But these are not the only\r\nhandicaps from which the African continent suffers.\r\nAfrica’s foreign debt is estimated at more than $350\r\nbillion, posing a major handicap to social and\r\neconomic development. Africa benefits only\r\nmarginally from the rapid expansion of international\r\ntrade. Despite the great concessions that Africa made\r\nin the World Trade Organization’s 1994 Marrakesh\r\nAgreement, three years after the adoption of UN-\r\nNADAF Africa’s share of international trade remains\r\ninsignificant and does not reflect the commitments of\r\ndeveloped countries to open up their markets to\r\nAfrican exports. The closure of markets of developed\r\ncountries continues to affect the African countries’\r\nmost competitive products. The shrinking of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, as has been stated, continues\r\nto affect the economies of many African countries and\r\nfor many African countries, particularly the least\r\ndeveloped countries, official development assistance is\r\nan important source of financing for economic and\r\nsocial development projects.\r\nDespite the expansion of investment flows, Africa\r\nbenefits only slightly from foreign investment,\r\nrepresenting barely two per cent of international\r\ninvestment flows, which is far from meeting its needs\r\nin terms of financing for development. Furthermore,\r\nAfrica’s share in investment flows has been dropping\r\nsteadily since the 1990s, while encouraging investment\r\nis one of the pillars of the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor Development in Africa (UN-NADAF). The\r\ncontinent continues to experience instability and the\r\nconsequences of war. Unfortunately, that situation has\r\nnot allowed Africa to focus on its social and economic\r\ndevelopment and has seriously affected the\r\ndevelopment policies of many African countries. In\r\nthis regard, we welcome the action of the United\r\nNations in this area and the efforts deployed to assist\r\nAfrica in peacekeeping, even if this action is still\r\ninsufficient in many countries where State structures\r\nhave virtually collapsed.\r\nThe conditions that prevailed before the adoption\r\nof the UN-NADAF in the 1990s have, unfortunately,\r\nnot changed. Because of the interweaving of internal\r\nand external factors, the initiative that we are speaking\r\nabout was not able to meet the specific needs of Africa\r\nin terms of development. Of course, this is a shared\r\nresponsibility. Africa’s recovery requires an innovative\r\napproach and policies that must be based on a\r\ncomprehensive and integrated vision and on more\r\nappropriate solutions.\r\nWhile it is true that Africa must count on itself to\r\nmobilize the necessary resources for its own\r\ndevelopment, the contribution of the international\r\ncommunity remains essential. Such a contribution\r\npresumes international solidarity, which would allow\r\nthe establishment of national strategies adapted to the\r\nsituation of every country. It would also mean opening\r\nup the markets of rich countries to exports from\r\nAfrican countries. It also presumes improving access to\r\nthe markets of these rich countries for exports from\r\nAfrican countries, and this remains a vital factor that\r\nwould make it possible for Africans to find the\r\nnecessary resources to finance their development\r\nactivities.\r\nLastly, we should also add that special attention\r\nshould be paid to the problems of the most heavily\r\nindebted countries and to the real need to rethink debt\r\nin terms of cancellation or rescheduling. The\r\nstrengthening of international economic cooperation\r\nand coherence in economic, trade and financial policies\r\ncan contribute to the efforts of African countries to\r\nimprove their economic situation. Even though the\r\nfinal review and appraisal gives us an opportunity\r\ntoday to decide on measures to be taken in this\r\ndirection, the delegation of Morocco harbours the hope\r\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the Fourth Ministerial Conference of\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nthe World Trade Organization, to be held soon, will\r\nprovide concrete solutions to the difficulties and\r\nobstacles that prevent African countries from achieving\r\nthe objectives stipulated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nTherefore, this is an acknowledgement of failure,\r\nfor the most part, that we must unfortunately admit,\r\nand it is based on the premise that development is a\r\nnational responsibility that Africa has decided to\r\nassume itself. It was along these lines that the New\r\nAfrican Initiative was adopted. This Initiative,\r\nwelcomed by the Economic and Social Council and\r\nsupported by the international community, lays the\r\ngroundwork for development in Africa and outlines the\r\nways to achieve it. Of course, in order to succeed, the\r\nNew African Initiative requires once again the firm\r\nsupport of the main players in the global economy.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report points out, the\r\nreview of the implementation of the New Agenda\r\noffers the international community the opportunity to\r\nonce again assess the action of African countries and\r\nallows us to see the support that these countries have\r\nreceived thus far. This opportunity that we have today\r\nis also a way of determining how the United Nations\r\nand all the participants can intervene effectively to\r\npromote development.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco supports, in this\r\ncontext, the Secretary-General’s statement and his\r\nrecommendation to set up an ad hoc committee to\r\nstudy this appraisal. We believe that the review to be\r\nundertaken should try to see what progress has been\r\nachieved and should identify the obstacles and\r\ndifficulties encountered by the African countries and,\r\nfinally, should help us think about the paths to be\r\nfollowed in the future to provide valuable assistance to\r\nAfrica, which needs help in its efforts to meet the\r\naspirations of all of its peoples.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express my gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on the final review of\r\nthe New Agenda for Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s (UN-NADAF). The final review and appraisal of\r\nthis New Agenda give us the opportunity to assess the\r\nefforts deployed both by the African countries and the\r\ninternational community to eradicate poverty and\r\npromote development and economic growth in Africa.\r\nThis is also an opportunity to draw up a tally of our\r\nachievements, the difficulties encountered and the\r\nlessons learned in the joint initiative undertaken\r\nthroughout the past decade. The mid-term assessment\r\nof 1996 showed that the same critical situation that\r\nprevailed at the beginning of the 1990s continued to\r\naffect the continent as a whole, in spite of a degree of\r\nprogress noted in some countries.\r\nToday, also because of the mix of internal and\r\nexternal factors, Africa is still faced with the same\r\nchallenges of poverty, malnutrition, underdevelopment\r\nand pandemics. Notwithstanding numerous difficulties,\r\nthe majority of African countries are committed to\r\npolitical reform to establish democracy and promote\r\ngood governance and to economic restructuring aimed\r\nat liberalizing the economy, but the social costs of this\r\nhave been very high. The efforts and the sacrifices\r\nagreed to by African countries to honour their\r\ncommitments taken at the various international\r\nconferences have not always received the desired\r\nsupport and assistance expected from the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe acceleration of globalization, the heavy\r\nburden of external debt, the continuing decline in\r\nofficial development assistance, the weakness of\r\nfinancial cash flow, the lack of direct foreign\r\ninvestments, the falling prices of export goods and\r\nlimited access to world markets have all considerably\r\nreduced the capacities of African countries. It is\r\ntherefore with real interest that Africa awaits the final\r\nreview in 2002, with the justified hope and aspiration\r\nthat their concerns will be addressed more effectively.\r\nGiven what I have just said, Algeria considers that the\r\nfinal review and appraisal of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa (UN-NADAF)\r\nshould include joint consideration on measures and\r\ninitiatives that are adapted to the new climate of\r\nglobalization and capable of responding effectively to\r\nAfricans’ concerns. The mobilization of adequate\r\nfinancial resources, both at national and international\r\nlevels, is, in this respect, a determining factor for the\r\nfinancing and completion of all development strategies,\r\nwhich explains all the hopes that African countries\r\nhave placed in the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, to be held in March 2002\r\nin Mexico.\r\nIn the Ministerial Declaration adopted during its\r\nsubstantive session last July in Geneva, the Economic\r\nand Social Council considered that the General\r\nAssembly should study how to improve the\r\neffectiveness of United Nations support for African\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\npriorities and initiatives. The same concern to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations system in its support to\r\nAfrica is rightly emphasized in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. My delegation fully supports this approach.\r\nMoreover, Algeria welcomes the appointment by the\r\nSecretary-General of this 12-member independent\r\nPanel of High-level Personalities on African\r\nDevelopment, which represents the international\r\ncommunity and is charged with making a worthy,\r\nindependent and high-level evaluation of the\r\nimplementation of the UN-NADAF, including its\r\nrelationship with other initiatives. We are convinced\r\nthat this independent working group, through the\r\nchoice and the representativeness of the personalities\r\nthat make it up, will perform its mission successfully.\r\nIn the view of the Algerian delegation, the\r\nindependent evaluation and the final review should be\r\na part of continued support by the international\r\ncommunity for development in Africa and the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),\r\nadopted at the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\r\nsummit in Lusaka in July 2001, is a major initiative\r\nthat should be integrated in the future in all new\r\narrangements in the United Nations aimed at meeting\r\nthe challenge of eliminating poverty and bringing about\r\ngrowth and sustainable development in Africa. This\r\nAfrican initiative, as stressed in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, is owing to the will and determination\r\nof African countries to take their development in their\r\nown hands and their efforts at redefining the conditions\r\nfor partnership with the international community. Even\r\nif it is convinced that it must first and foremost count\r\non its own efforts, the African continent also knows\r\nthat it needs assistance and support. In this respect, my\r\ndelegation was pleased at the favourable welcome\r\ngiven to this initiative by the international community,\r\nparticularly by the member countries of the G-8 and by\r\nthe European Union more recently.\r\nWe fully support the recommendation by the\r\nSecretary-General at the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to establish an ad hoc committee of\r\nthe whole responsible for proceeding to the final\r\nreview and appraisal of the New Agenda for Africa, in\r\n2002. Pending that review, Algeria believes that\r\nconsideration of the successor arrangement to the New\r\nAgenda should include certain principles such as\r\neffective commitment by the international community\r\nto solidarity and true partnership with Africa, respect\r\nfor national and regional development priorities,\r\nAfrican ownership of the cooperation programmes and\r\nsignificant support for African national and regional\r\ncapabilities in the field of coordinating programmes for\r\ncooperation and development assistance.\r\nIn conclusion, Algeria reiterates its appeal to the\r\ninternational community to seize this opportunity of\r\nthe final review and appraisal of the New Agenda in\r\n2002 to reaffirm its commitment to genuine world\r\npartnership to further African development, in which\r\nthe United Nations system is called on to play a central\r\nrole. Such a global framework would integrate all\r\nexisting initiatives, and particularly the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, to ensure greater\r\nconsistency of goals and better coordination of\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe pleasure to speak on item 22 of our agenda, and I\r\nam delighted to welcome here the interest shown by the\r\ninternational community for development and growth\r\nin Africa. The United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa (UN-NADAF) has come at a\r\ntimely moment so as to give concrete form to the\r\nUnited Nations commitment to development in Africa.\r\nThis programme bears witness to the commitment of\r\nMember States of the Organization to support Africa’s\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nThe final review and appraisal of the New\r\nAgenda, 10 years after it was launched, will give us in\r\n2002 the opportunity to review the results of the action\r\ncarried out by the African countries and by the\r\ninternational community as a whole to foster the\r\ndevelopment of the African continent. It will allow us\r\nto appraise all the activities undertaken by the partners\r\ninvolved in the various fields covered by the New\r\nAgenda and to identify successes, obstacles, failures\r\nand lessons learned. Moreover, the final review and\r\nappraisal will offer the international community the\r\nopportunity to decide on the steps to be taken to\r\nimplement the Millennium Declaration, to which our\r\nHeads of State and Government committed themselves,\r\ninter alia, to help the Africans in their struggle to bring\r\nabout peace and sustainable development and to\r\neradicate poverty, so as to integrate the African\r\ncontinent into the world economy.\r\nIn this respect, I would like to welcome the\r\nestablishment by the Secretary-General of the 12-\r\nmember Panel of High-level Personalities on African\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nDevelopment, who are responsible for supervising this\r\nappraisal. We welcome the fact that this group will\r\nmeet in March 2002 in order to examine the evaluation\r\nbefore the final draft report is presented to the\r\nAssembly on 31 May 2002.\r\nThe efforts of Africa could never be crowned\r\nwith success without significant support from the\r\ninternational community. This solidarity should be\r\nevident through offers of sufficient, reliable resources,\r\non the one hand, and through the establishment of a\r\nfavourable external climate, on the other. The\r\nmagnitude of the problems and the complexity of the\r\nobstacles that the continent must overcome to build the\r\nfoundations of its infrastructure and social and\r\neconomic development require that we show much\r\nmore resolve and devote many more resources, both at\r\nthe national and international levels, to guarantee that\r\nAfrica, like other parts of the world, will have\r\neconomic growth and continued and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nDuring the last decade, many African countries\r\nhave intensified the process of democratization and\r\nstrengthening civil society and of the promotion of\r\nhuman rights and respect for the rule of law. African\r\ncountries have also undertaken economic reforms to\r\nfurther the establishment of a solid macroeconomic\r\nfoundation and create an environment that is conducive\r\nto sustainable development and reducing poverty,\r\nparticularly by effective public administration.\r\nHowever, it should be recognized that the current\r\nefforts of developed countries and the United Nations\r\nsystem are far from adequate to meet the problems\r\nfaced by Africa. This is true of official development\r\nassistance and investment, as well as of the response to\r\nindebtedness. In spite of the efforts of African\r\ncountries to make better use of it, official development\r\nassistance continues to shrink. While we are very\r\ngrateful to those countries that have fulfilled their\r\ncommitment to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\ndomestic product to official development assistance,\r\nwe call on those developed countries that have not\r\nfulfilled their commitment to shoulder their\r\nresponsibilities in that respect, so that the majority of\r\nAfrican countries can achieve stronger growth.\r\nAfrica’s marginalization in respect of foreign\r\ndirect investment is comparable to its marginalization\r\nin terms of trade. Despite the considerable efforts made\r\nby many African countries to reform their trade\r\npolicies, Africa’s share of the world market — less\r\nthan 2 per cent — is very small. According to the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development,\r\nof the 48 sub-Saharan African countries, 39 depend on\r\njust two primary commodities, of either agricultural or\r\nmineral origin, for more than 50 per cent of their\r\nexport earnings. This is a matter of particular concern,\r\nand it is the duty of the international community to\r\nassist African countries in establishing the kind of\r\nmaterial, institutional and organizational capabilities\r\nthat they need to underpin their efforts to promote trade\r\nand improve access to markets, and to further reduce\r\nthe customs tariffs and eliminate non-tariff barriers that\r\nAfrican commodities face.\r\nIndebtedness remains one of the main obstacles to\r\neconomic revival and sustainable growth in Africa. The\r\ninternational community should continue to cooperate\r\nto decrease the burden that weighs heavily on the debt-\r\nridden African countries. We call upon the creditor\r\ncountries, private banks and multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions to help the African countries to free\r\nthemselves of debt, more rapidly and durably,\r\nparticularly by applying, on an accelerated basis, the\r\nexpanded and strengthened Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative. Furthermore, countries\r\nemerging from conflict situations have particular needs\r\nand deserve special treatment, and we must be flexible\r\nin our approach to them and generous in the way we\r\ntreat their debt arrears.\r\nInformation and communication technology is\r\nplaying an increasingly important role as a catalyst for\r\neconomic and social development in African countries.\r\nAfrican countries are called on to develop their\r\ninformation and communication technology as an\r\nintegral part of their national and regional\r\ndevelopment. Africa’s international partners, for their\r\npart, are expected to treat the issue of information and\r\ncommunication technology as a priority issue for\r\nAfrica’s development.\r\nWhen launching the New African Initiative —\r\nrecently renamed the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment — the aim of the African leaders was to\r\nreaffirm their collective will to promote the African\r\ncontinent in the framework of an integrated action plan\r\nbased on a global approach to the elements for\r\nsustainable development, underpinned by Africa’s own\r\ncapabilities. In this context, we welcome the fact that\r\nthat initiative has enjoyed the support and\r\nencouragement of the international community,\r\nparticularly the G-8, the European Union countries, the\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\ninternational financial institutions, the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. We are convinced that the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development will provide the right kind of\r\nframework for Africa’s development, and we would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to appeal to the\r\ninternational community to take whatever measures are\r\nnecessary so as to respond in an effective and\r\nconcerted manner to this significant initiative as a new\r\nmechanism to succeed the New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s. We must all work\r\nto make it a success.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nI would like to express my gratitude and pleasure at\r\naddressing this Assembly on the important item on our\r\nagenda entitled “Final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s”. For the past\r\ntwo decades, the development of Africa has\r\npreoccupied this Assembly in its work — from the\r\nspecial session in 1986, which adopted the United\r\nNations Programme of Action for African Recovery\r\nand Development (UNPAERD), to the New Agenda\r\n(UN-NADAF) today. The circumstances which led to\r\nthe adoption of UNPAERD and UN-NADAF are as\r\nvalid today as they were in 1986 and 1991.\r\nAfrica has a potential for growth and\r\ndevelopment. That is why it has embarked on an\r\nambitious reform process aimed at harnessing that\r\npotential, in the full recognition that its development is,\r\nin the final analysis, its own responsibility. In this\r\nregard, the continent has seized the challenge, and\r\nAfrican countries have committed themselves to\r\nimplementing policies and programmes to create an\r\nenvironment conducive to growth and development.\r\nThis has enabled Africa to halt a deteriorating trend,\r\nand in many cases to register modest growth. Success\r\nwould have been substantial but for the enormous\r\nproblems Africa faces. Poor infrastructure, HIV/AIDS\r\nand poor terms of trade are just a few of the\r\nconstraints. Nevertheless, a supportive international\r\nenvironment in terms of increased financial resources\r\nand other mechanisms will help to sustain the changes\r\nthat are being implemented.\r\nIncreased resources are critical if the process of\r\nreform and restructuring is to be sustained. I need\r\nhardly stress that, given the interdependence of the\r\nworld economy, the whole of mankind stands to benefit\r\nfrom progress in Africa. This was duly recognized in\r\nUN-NADAF.\r\nAt the Organization of African Unity summit held\r\nin Lusaka in July this year, African leaders, driven by a\r\nnew political will, adopted a new partnership for\r\nAfrican development strategy as the cornerstone of the\r\nAfrican renaissance. The strategy, which is owned by\r\nAfricans themselves, has earmarked priority sectors\r\nwhich Africans will address so as to rid the continent\r\nof the poverty trap and place their countries on the path\r\ntowards sustained growth and sustainable development.\r\nThese sectors include infrastructure, information and\r\ncommunication technology, human resource\r\ndevelopment, agriculture and the diversification of\r\nproduction and exports.\r\nMy delegation believes that for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment efforts to be meaningful, there is a need\r\nfor the international community to forge a new\r\npartnership with Africa to address, in a comprehensive\r\nmanner, the problems facing the continent and to find\r\nlasting solutions.\r\nIn this regard, there is an urgent need to review\r\nthe determination and the commitment to implement\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda, in line with the New\r\nAfrican Initiative, so that the two complement each\r\nother. To this end, the decision by the General\r\nAssembly to conduct the final review and appraisal of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda in the year 2002 is a\r\ntimely one. We believe that this occasion will give all\r\nparties to the UN-NADAF process the opportunity to\r\nreflect on the successes and failures they encountered\r\nwhile implementing this programme and to chart out a\r\nnew course.\r\nTen years of implementation of UN-NADAF has\r\ndemonstrated that the gap between Africa and the\r\ndeveloped countries has continued to widen. This is\r\nmanifested in increasing levels of poverty, declining\r\nterms of trade, declining levels of official development\r\nassistance, lack of progress in the transfer of\r\ntechnology, and, above all, a high level of external\r\ndebt.\r\nOne could also say that this trend is the result of\r\ndowngrading the issue of development from its priority\r\nplace on the international agenda. In this context,\r\ntherefore, it is not farfetched to believe that Africa’s\r\nefforts to develop will be successful only if\r\ncomplemented by a conducive international\r\nenvironment.\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nThe burden of external debt has a negative impact\r\non the majority of developing countries. Radical\r\nmeasures on debt reduction will enable funds to be\r\nfreed up and made available for other productive\r\nactivities, including the provision of social services.\r\nConcerning external trade, commodity trade has\r\nremained the major source of earnings in all African\r\ncountries. However, the continued instability of prices\r\nin commodity markets denies Africa much of the\r\nrequired export earnings. Meanwhile, the higher prices\r\nof industrial goods have made it difficult for Africa to\r\nmodernize its productive system, hence the continent’s\r\nexports and share of trade have remained very low. It is\r\nimperative, therefore, that measures be taken to\r\nincrease the participation of African countries in global\r\ntrade to avoid further marginalization. The African\r\nGrowth and Opportunity Act is a positive step in that\r\ndirection.\r\nThe rate of return on investment in Africa is very\r\nhigh — about 30 per cent. Despite this profitability,\r\nforeign direct investment flows into the continent have\r\nbeen relatively insignificant. Of all of the foreign direct\r\ninvestment directed to the developing countries,\r\nAfrica’s share stands at less than 2 per cent, with a\r\nbigger share going mostly to Asia and Latin America.\r\nAfrica lacks the resources needed to undertake all the\r\nnecessary construction and build the infrastructure\r\nwhich can attract and support sustained flows of\r\nforeign direct investment. Even in the rare cases in\r\nwhich such infrastructure has been instituted, foreign\r\ndirect investment has not been forthcoming at a rate\r\nand a level that could have a positive impact and\r\nenable Africa to make an economic turnaround.\r\nIn this regard, Africa needs the concerted action\r\nof all. We therefore hope that it will be possible for\r\nAfrica’s development partners, in supporting UN-\r\nNADAF, to increase their assistance to Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation supports fully the\r\nproposal to establish an Ad Hoc Committee of the\r\nWhole to carry out the final review and appraisal of\r\nUN-NADAF. We also support the proposal for the Ad\r\nHoc Committee to meet in September 2002 for two\r\ndays prior to the review meeting. We urge all interested\r\nparties to start early preparations and send high-level\r\nrepresentation to the review meeting so as to make it a\r\nsuccess.\r\nMr. Fahmy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me\r\nat the outset to express our appreciation for the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the final review and\r\nappraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa (UN-NADAF).\r\nIn this regard, I should like to reiterate that the\r\nsuccess of any initiative for development is based on\r\ntwo major factors, namely political will on the part of\r\nthe States concerned and the availability of the\r\nnecessary financial resources to operationalize the\r\nideas and proposals contained in the initiative. These\r\ntwo factors have been lacking in most of the initiatives\r\non Africa, particularly the resource factor. This has\r\nbeen a primary reason for the failure of these initiatives\r\nto achieve their objectives, despite all of the positive\r\nwording and the good intentions that accompanied\r\nthose initiatives when they were launched.\r\nThere have been some successes and some\r\nfailures in the course of the implementation of UN-\r\nNADAF. Nevertheless, my delegation’s statement\r\ntoday will concentrate on recent developments in\r\nAfrica after the initiative of the New Agenda. African\r\nleaders, at the recent Lusaka summit, adopted an\r\nintegrated and comprehensive initiative on\r\ndevelopment in Africa, the New African Initiative, now\r\nknown as the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThat initiative enjoyed unprecedented unanimity\r\namong all the people of the continent. It provides a\r\ncomprehensive and integrated vision and framework\r\nfor efforts towards African development in the\r\ncontinent as a whole. It recognizes the commitments\r\nand obligations of the African peoples themselves,\r\nwhich are considerable. We hope that these\r\ncommitments and efforts will be matched by a clear\r\ninternational commitment by Africa’s partners in order\r\nto build on the national efforts and to bridge the\r\nexisting financial gap. This will enable the hopes and\r\naspirations of the peoples of the continent to be\r\nrealized in advancing development and progress on the\r\nbasis of respect for democracy, human rights, good\r\ngovernance and the establishment of peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThis was agreed upon by the peoples of the\r\ncontinent themselves in order to harness these concepts\r\nto serve development efforts and to achieve the\r\nparticipation of all the peoples of the continent in such\r\nefforts.\r\nEgypt participated effectively with the other\r\ncountries of the continent in the formulation of the\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.38\r\nconcept of the New Partnerships for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. This reflects Egypt’s belief that we must\r\nformulate a growth strategy that enjoys the unanimous\r\nagreement of the peoples of the continent. Egypt hopes\r\nthat their future and that of succeeding generations will\r\nbe determined through their free will, in the framework\r\nof a clear awareness and understanding of national,\r\nregional and international developments and of the\r\nspirit of the times at the beginning of this third\r\nmillennium.\r\nWe hope that, in the implementation of this\r\ncomprehensive framework, the political will of the\r\npeoples of the continent to advance development\r\nefforts throughout the continent will be matched by\r\nthat of the international community.\r\nWe also hope that this will be translated into the\r\nmaking available of additional external resources by\r\nthe international community in order to bridge the\r\nexisting financial gaps on the national and regional\r\nlevels for achieving the desired development in Africa.\r\nIn this regard, we recall that Africa enjoys a\r\nspecial status. It is the litmus test for international\r\nefforts in the implementation of the objectives of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, in particular that of halving\r\nworldwide abject poverty by 2015. We hope that this\r\nwill be taken into account during the preparations for\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Mexico next March, and\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development, to be\r\nheld in Johannesburg next September.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to point out that,\r\nregardless of the outcome of the review and appraisal\r\nof UN-NADAF, we look forward to a swift transitional\r\nstage, during which all the shortcomings that marred\r\nthe implementation of that initiative will be avoided\r\nand during which efforts will be made to build upon the\r\npositive aspects to operationalize and spread the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development initiative,\r\nexpressing the new spirit in Africa, with a view to\r\nsupporting development efforts and progress, as chosen\r\nby the peoples of the African continent themselves.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nMembers that a draft resolution under this agenda item\r\nwill be submitted at a later date.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
