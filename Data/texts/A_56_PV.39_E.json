The present membership of the Commission is\r\nset out in the annex to document A/56/117 of 21 June\r\n2001.\r\nThe notes by the Secretary-General concerning\r\nthe candidates are contained in documents A/56/117\r\nand Corr.1 and Add.1-3.\r\nMembers will recall that the Assembly, at its 31st\r\nplenary meeting, on 26 October 2001, decided to\r\nrequest the Secretary-General to issue a consolidated\r\nlist incorporating new candidates and additional\r\ninformation on candidates received subsequent to the\r\ndeadline for the submission of nominations.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.39\r\nIn this connection, the Assembly now has before\r\nit the note by the Secretary-General contained in\r\ndocument A/56/486 of 30 October 2001 and Corr.1,\r\nwhich consolidates in alphabetical order the candidates\r\nnominated by Governments of States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations for election to the International Law\r\nCommission. There is a total of 45 candidates eligible\r\nin this election.\r\nThe notes by the Secretary-General concerning\r\nthe statements of qualifications of candidates are\r\ncontained in document A/56/124 and Add.1.\r\nI should like to recall for members that, in\r\naccordance with the statute, the persons to be elected to\r\nthe International Law Commission should individually\r\npossess the qualifications required. They should be\r\n“persons of recognized competence in international\r\nlaw”. The statute also provides that in the Commission\r\nas a whole, representation of the main forms of\r\ncivilization and of the principal legal systems of the\r\nworld should be assured.\r\nPursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly\r\nresolution 36/39 of 18 November 1981, the 34\r\nmembers should be elected as follows: nine nationals\r\nfrom African States, eight nationals from Asian States,\r\nthree nationals from Eastern European States, six\r\nnationals from Latin American and Caribbean States,\r\nand eight nationals from Western European and other\r\nStates. The ballot papers reflect this pattern.\r\nI should like to inform members that the number\r\nof those candidates, not exceeding the number of seats\r\nto be filled, receiving the greatest number of votes and\r\nnot less than a majority of the votes of the Member\r\nStates present and voting shall be declared elected. In\r\nthe case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there will be\r\na special restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nwho have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with rule\r\n92 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly,\r\nthe election shall be held by secret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules\r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the vote.\r\nBallot papers marked A, B, C, D and E will now\r\nbe distributed. I request the representatives to use only\r\nthose ballot papers. Representatives are requested to\r\nplace a cross to the left of the names of the candidates\r\nfor whom they wish to vote. Representatives may vote\r\nonly for those candidates whose names appear on the\r\nballot papers, but for no more than the number of seats\r\nallocated to each region. A ballot paper containing\r\nmore votes than the number of seats allocated to the\r\nrelevant region will be declared invalid. Let me repeat:\r\nrepresentatives are requested to place a cross to the left\r\nof the names of the candidates for whom they wish to\r\nvote. Representatives may vote only for those\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers,\r\nbut for no more than the number of seats allocated to\r\neach region.\r\nAccordingly, please ensure that the ballot papers\r\nmarked A, for African States, do not contain votes for\r\nmore than nine candidates; the ballot papers marked B,\r\nfor Asian States, do not contain votes for more than\r\neight candidates; the ballot papers marked C, for\r\nEastern European States, do not contain votes for more\r\nthan three candidates; the ballot papers marked D, for\r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, do not contain\r\nvotes for more than six candidates; and the ballot\r\npapers marked E, for Western European and other\r\nStates, do not contain votes for more than eight\r\ncandidates.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President,\r\nMs. Turnquest (Bahamas), Ms. Burke (Barbados),\r\nMr. Trifunović (Bosnia and Herzegovina),\r\nMs. Hanson (Canada), Mr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) and\r\nMr. Kamara (Sierra Leone) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 1.10 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is\r\nas follows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  178\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 178\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of members voting: 176\r\nRequired majority: 89\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.39\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Christopher John Dugard\r\n(South Africa) 159\r\nMr. Pedro Comissario Afonso \r\n(Mozambique) 157\r\nMr. Emmanuel Akwei Addo (Ghana) 154\r\nMr. James L.
