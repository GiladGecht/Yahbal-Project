(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 25 (continued)\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/523)\r\nDraft resolution (A/56/L.3)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat, in letters dated 8 and 22 October 2001 addressed\r\nto the President of the General Assembly, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Ireland to the United\r\nNations, in his capacity as Chairman of the Group of\r\nWestern European and other States for the month of\r\nOctober, requests that the General Assembly hear, in\r\nplenary meeting, statements by the observer for the\r\nHoly See and the observer of Switzerland in the debate\r\non agenda item 25, “United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations”.\r\nTaking into account the importance attached to\r\nthe issue under discussion, it is proposed that the\r\nGeneral Assembly take a decision on those requests.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the\r\nproposal to hear the observer for the Holy See and the\r\nobserver of Switzerland in the debate on agenda item\r\n25?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Belkhadem (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nassumption of the presidency of the fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly. This well-deserved honour\r\nattests to your diplomatic skills and to your personal\r\ncommitment to the strengthening of the United\r\nNations. It also represents a recognition of the positive\r\nrole played by your country, whose well-known\r\neconomic dynamism is complemented by ongoing\r\nefforts towards peace and international cooperation.\r\nI should like also to recall the importance that my\r\ncountry, Algeria, attaches to the peaceful reunification\r\nof Korea and to welcome the promising efforts\r\ndeployed in this regard by the Government of the\r\nRepublic of Korea and by the Government of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. President, you are guiding our work at a time\r\nwhen the United Nations is taking up once again its\r\nnatural role as a key player in order to meet the various\r\nchallenges confronting humanity. The fact that this\r\nyear’s Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and to our Organization\r\nis testimony of the invaluable contribution they have\r\nmade to the quest for peace and understanding among\r\npeoples, and it also strengthens our conviction that the\r\nUnited Nations has an irreplaceable role to play as a\r\nframework for collective action for peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. The fact that a new mandate has been\r\ngiven to Mr. Kofi Annan assures us that the necessary\r\nwork of renewal will continue — work he has, in fact,\r\nbeen doing since he took the helm of the Organization.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nThe proclamation of the year 2001 as the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations is\r\nwithout a doubt a milestone in the history of\r\nhumankind. By duly recognizing the contributions\r\nmade by all civilizations to the humanization of\r\nsocieties, it demonstrates the common will to work\r\ntogether to develop and consolidate the foundations of\r\na world of understanding, amity and interaction.\r\nPresident Khatami set out, in a very succinct and\r\nlucid manner, guidelines for the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations — a dialogue that today has top priority.\r\nThe rise of extremism and terrorism has emphasized\r\nthe topical nature of this concept, and has prompted us\r\nto reflect once again on prospects for the future — a\r\nfuture that will make sense only if we face it in a spirit\r\nof interdependence and of solidarity.\r\nThere is no yellow peril. There is no green peril.\r\nThe only peril we are facing is that of intolerance,\r\nwhich is certainly not inherent to any particular\r\nreligion or civilization. The greatest peril is that of\r\nhatred and rejection of the other.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations was the subject,\r\na year ago, of a round table organized by the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization. That event took place at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters, here in this building, which symbolizes\r\nthe many common battles we have had to wage as well\r\nas the common aspirations of humanity as a whole. The\r\nparticipation of President Bouteflika in that round table\r\nalso was testimony of Algeria’s contribution,\r\nthroughout history, to efforts to bring people together\r\nand of its commitment to pursue this noble endeavour\r\nin future.\r\nAlgeria has always been a meeting place for\r\ncultural interaction in the Mediterranean region, even\r\nback when the lake of peace that we are trying to create\r\ntoday was a confluent for the entire world.\r\nFrom St. Augustine to Emir Abdelkader,\r\nAlgeria’s contributions over the years to the\r\ndevelopment of universal spirituality, tolerance and\r\nculture have made us more attuned to contemporary\r\nproblems and more desirous to work towards their\r\nresolution and to promote a new kind of humanism —\r\none that is based on the diversity of civilizations and\r\ncultures and on the unity of humankind.\r\nAlgeria has always been, and today more than\r\never wishes to be, a place of openness, interaction and\r\nunderstanding. It is working to harmonize its own\r\nindividual characteristics with universal values.\r\nThe history of humanity, which is peppered not\r\nonly with major accomplishments and great works but\r\nalso with mistakes, upheavals and tragedies, has helped\r\nhuman beings, in all their diversity, to evolve so as to\r\ncoexist peacefully and harmoniously with others in a\r\npluralistic, open and tolerant atmosphere.\r\nThe present generation, which is the result of\r\nvarious historical upheavals, is more aware than ever\r\nbefore of the importance of this diversity, which also\r\nhelps us to become closer to, and learn from, one\r\nanother. This is reflected very eloquently in the\r\npreamble of the Charter of the United Nations, which\r\nproclaimed the determination of the international\r\ncommunity to eliminate the scourge of war, which has\r\nbrought untold sorrow and has left indelible marks on\r\nhumanity as a whole.\r\nThe era of confrontation existed only because\r\nextremist forces were able to prevail against the\r\nbackdrop of suspicion and exclusion. The collective\r\nreaction of human beings is reconciliation if they are\r\ngiven the opportunity to promote dialogue, cooperation\r\nand mutual understanding. To know others is to move\r\ntowards them, to understand and better know them —\r\nin short, to appreciate and respect one another so as to\r\ngrow closer.\r\nTo this end, we must talk to each other more in\r\norder better to understand each other and to learn\r\nmutual respect. We must be able to live together\r\nwithout clashing in order simply to coexist peacefully\r\nwithin the increasingly narrow confines of our planet.\r\nWe do not believe that there are good and bad\r\ncivilizations, that some civilizations are superior to\r\nothers or that others have congenital flaws, whereas\r\nothers can be predominant and held up as the single\r\nmodel to follow. Rather, we are of the view that\r\ncivilizations are complementary, that they nourish each\r\nother and that they converge towards universal values\r\nthat are shared by the whole of humanity. Islam, a\r\nreligion of peace and tolerance, like all other revealed\r\nreligions, gave rise to a brilliant civilization that covers\r\na vast geographic area within which people of all races\r\nlive united by a common faith while respecting the\r\nfaith and way of life of others.\r\nNo one can have any doubts that today we are\r\nwitnessing the growing spread of a universal\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\ncivilization that is but the result of the numerous\r\ncontributions and experiences made by various human\r\ncivilizations since the dawn of time. If the words\r\nglobalization and Internet are on everyone’s lips, it is\r\nbecause they have been translated into every language.\r\nBut, propelled primarily by economic dynamics, one\r\nlanguage in particular has dominated this universal\r\ncivilization. While it is also true that major works, and\r\neven much lesser ones, are frequently translated into\r\nnumerous languages from such languages as Chinese,\r\nArabic, Hebrew and Persian, it must not be forgotten\r\nthat dozens of languages are dying as a result of having\r\nlost the battle against the universal.\r\nThe irresistible momentum towards the universal\r\nhas therefore produced victims similar to those left\r\nbehind by globalization. But the cultural and spiritual\r\nwealth of humankind stems from its diversity. While\r\nwe can all subscribe to the idea that, as far as economic\r\ndevelopment is concerned, the superiority of the law of\r\nmarkets has been proved in history, the standardization\r\nof thought and cultural and religious exclusion cannot\r\nbut lead to an impoverishment of the mind and the\r\nsoul. In that context, while the “end of history” may\r\nhave seemed an academic controversy in a Western\r\nworld sated with its material comfort, for the excluded\r\nand marginalized in many regions of our world it is a\r\nconcrete, tragic reality and must be dealt with strongly.\r\nThat is what was rightly asserted by the former\r\nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),\r\nMr. Federico Mayor, when he said that no country is so\r\nlarge that it can do without others, and no country is so\r\nsmall that it has nothing to contribute to others.\r\nHaving classified them as the common patrimony\r\nof mankind, UNESCO has under its protection\r\nhistorical sites threatened by natural phenomena and\r\nhuman plundering; but what are we to do for those\r\ncultures threatened by indifference and exclusion? Of\r\ncourse, not all cultures and civilizations different from\r\nthe dominant culture are condemned to disappear.\r\nSome, as if emerging from a stupor, are awakening.\r\nThat awakening should not be perceived as a threat to\r\nthe dominant culture, but rather as a new boon that\r\nstrengthens the universal civilization, benefiting all\r\npeople and spreading beyond man-made borders, which\r\nthe march of history has a tendency to blur.\r\nIn order for that kind of development to be\r\nunderstood and encouraged, it is necessary to establish\r\nand pursue a true dialogue among civilizations. As\r\nRoger Garaudy said about 25 years ago, there will be\r\ntrue dialogue only when everyone is convinced at the\r\noutset that we all have something to learn from one\r\nanother. There will be true dialogue among\r\ncivilizations only if everyone is imbued with the\r\nconviction that the other is what he is missing in order\r\nto be a complete human being.\r\nThe inevitable references in our proceedings to\r\nthe painful and tragic attacks of 11 September remind\r\nus that the dialogue among civilizations to which we\r\naspire is not without impact on the daily lives of\r\nmillions of human beings. If we want that dialogue to\r\ndraw upon the values and noble achievements of the\r\nhuman heart and spirit that have been most cherished\r\nsince mankind began the historical journey that jolted\r\nit from its natural state, that dialogue must not remain\r\nconfined to colloquiums, symposiums and seminars\r\ndevoted to specialists, philosophers and scientists, even\r\nthough such people certainly contribute a great deal to\r\nsuch dialogue.\r\nFor that dialogue to truly permeate all areas of\r\nteaching, learning, culture and active life, and for it to\r\nbe an essential component of human relations,\r\nGovernments must assume their responsibilities, which\r\ncomplement, naturally, those of civil society,\r\ninternational institutions, the media and religious\r\nauthorities. In this regard, it is a welcome development\r\nthat many meetings that heretofore have been devoted\r\nentirely to political and economic issues — such as\r\nthose of the League of Arab States, the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference and the Euro-Mediterranean\r\nForum — have decided to include the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations in their future agendas. As the ideal\r\nframework for dialogue and the settlement of conflict,\r\nthe United Nations has an essential role to play in\r\npromoting, improving and deepening this dialogue, to\r\nwhich everyone can, and should, make his contribution.\r\nBy being a sponsor of the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Global agenda for dialogue among civilizations”,\r\nwhich has been introduced in the General Assembly,\r\nAlgeria is demonstrating its faith in its cultural heritage\r\nand its belief in the universal cultural mission of that\r\nheritage. Algeria is also prepared to make its\r\ncontribution, and reiterates its willingness to organize\r\nmeetings to promote the very noble ideals that have\r\nbrought us together here. Ensuring the future of those\r\nideals requires the participation and contributions of\r\nall.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nMr. Shen Guofang (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThis year is the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations. At the outset, I would like to\r\nthank the Islamic Republic of Iran for its initiative to\r\ndiscuss this issue at the United Nations. For its\r\ncontribution, which is very useful to the deliberations\r\non this item, my thanks also go to the Group of\r\nEminent Persons on the Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nselected by the Secretary-General.\r\nIn the long process of its development, mankind\r\nhas created diversified civilizations that have, in no\r\nsmall way, served to enhance the progress of human\r\nsociety. Due to differences in historical background,\r\ngeographical conditions and cultural traditions, human\r\ncivilizations have demonstrated much diversity and\r\ndissimilarity through their development. The exchange\r\nand blending of that diversity and dissimilarity have, in\r\nturn, become an inexorable historical trend, as well as a\r\nnecessity for the improvement and continued\r\ndevelopment of civilizations. It is through that process\r\nthat human society has achieved continuous progress\r\nand development.\r\nIn the history of mankind, there have been\r\ncircumstances in which one civilization has rejected\r\nother civilizations and has attempted to force one set of\r\nvalues upon others. However, such attempts have all\r\nended in failure because they went against the\r\nhistorical trend of human development. History has\r\ndemonstrated that there is no need to be worried about\r\nthe differences and disputes among civilizations.\r\nRather, we should adopt an appropriate attitude\r\ntowards them. There are no superior or inferior\r\ncivilizations in this world. On the contrary, they are\r\nequal. The peaceful coexistence and the common\r\ndevelopment of different civilizations can be achieved\r\nonly through their learning and benefiting from each\r\nother on the basis of equality and mutual respect.\r\nProfound changes are taking place in the current\r\ninternational situation. With the further\r\nmultipolarization of the world situation, economic\r\nglobalization and the rapid development of technology,\r\nmankind faces unprecedented opportunities for\r\ndevelopment, as well as a series of global issues, such\r\nas environmental deterioration, terrorism, refugees,\r\npoverty and the widening gap between the North and\r\nthe South.\r\nUnder these circumstances, countries should\r\ndemonstrate a more open mind and broader vision in\r\nconducting the dialogue among civilizations and\r\nresolve disputes and differences by peaceful means. We\r\nshould demonstrate the willingness to respect and live\r\nwith different civilizations, promote the development\r\nof the cream of human civilizations and together face\r\nthe challenges of economic globalization, so as to\r\nestablish relations based on equality, mutual benefit,\r\nmutual trust and cooperation among countries and to\r\nachieve lasting peace, stability and prosperity in all\r\ncountries.\r\nThe terrorist attack of 11 September on the\r\nUnited States was a barbaric act that destroyed human\r\nlives and is a serious threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. It has nothing in common with human\r\ncivilization. The fight launched against terrorism by the\r\ninternational community is not a clash among races,\r\nreligions or cultures, but a struggle between justice and\r\nevil, between civilization and barbarism. All countries\r\nmust shoulder their responsibility to fight all\r\nmanifestations of terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations, as the sole universal\r\ninternational Organization, represents the diversity of\r\nthe world’s civilizations and is a forum for all\r\ncivilizations. It plays a unique role in promoting the\r\ndialogue among civilizations. In this context, I wish to\r\nmake the following points.\r\nFirst, the United Nations should conduct the\r\ndialogue among civilizations at the political level, in\r\norder to remove the negative impact of the cold-war\r\nmentality from international relations, promote the\r\nprinciple of democracy and equality in international\r\naffairs and advance the establishment of a just and\r\nequitable new international political order.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations should conduct the\r\ndialogue among civilizations at the economic level in\r\norder to become fully aware of the difficulties and the\r\nproblems countries face, particularly the developing\r\ncountries, in the economic globalization process;\r\nformulate an effective strategy of global economic\r\ncooperation, in accordance with the historical\r\nconditions and the socio-economic realities of the\r\nvarious countries and regions; and enable people from\r\ndifferent civilizations to benefit from globalization,\r\nthereby creating a win-win situation.\r\nThirdly, in the social and cultural domains, the\r\nUnited Nations should raise awareness within the\r\ninternational community on the need to respect and\r\npromote the diversity of civilizations; enhance the\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nprotection of cultural treasures; use modern means to\r\nspread and further develop the advanced and\r\nprogressive aspects of human civilizations; and\r\nencourage people of all countries, particularly the\r\nyouth, to carry out cultural exchanges of all kinds, so\r\nas to create greater prospects for the development of\r\ndiversified civilizations in the world.\r\nChina has always attached importance to\r\nstrengthening exchange and dialogue among countries\r\nand civilizations. Last February, the Chinese delegation\r\nattended the Conference on Dialogue among Asian\r\nCivilizations, held in Iran, at which it stated the views\r\nand positions of the Chinese Government on this issue.\r\nLast September, Mr. Song Yian, Vice-Chairman of the\r\nChinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and\r\nthe Chinese member of the United Nations Group of\r\nEminent Persons on Dialogue among Civilizations,\r\npresided over the Twenty-first Century Forum —\r\nSymposium on Dialogue among Civilizations, held in\r\nBeijing.\r\nThe Symposium carried out comprehensive and\r\nin-depth discussions, focusing on three topics: the role\r\nof exchange among civilizations in promoting human\r\nhistorical development, the effect of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations on the development of international\r\nrelations and the role of the United Nations in\r\npromoting dialogue among civilizations. The summary\r\nof the Symposium has already been distributed as an\r\nofficial document (A/56/471) of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Chinese Government and people stand ready\r\nto continue to make even greater contributions to\r\nstrengthening dialogue and exchange among\r\ncivilizations, as well as to the peace, progress and\r\nprosperity of the world.\r\nMr. Rangachari (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/56/523) on the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, a\r\nwelcome initiative of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We\r\nwould like to express our appreciation to the eminent\r\npersons who collaborated in producing the book\r\nCrossing the Divide: Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nWe would also like to convey our appreciation to the\r\nMember States that have arranged events to give\r\ncontent and meaning to this United Nations Year.\r\nAs the year designated by the General Assembly\r\nas the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations draws to a close, it seems appropriate that\r\nwe reflect on the concepts and ideas that have emerged\r\nin this process.\r\nDialogue among civilizations is not new. It has\r\nexisted since the earliest known civilizations. This\r\ndialogue, which spans many millennia, has blurred the\r\nboundaries of different civilizations. The world today\r\ncannot claim a finite number of distinct civilizations; it\r\nis, in fact, a multitude of overlapping cultures. Cultural\r\nintercourse, while blurring civilizational boundaries,\r\nhas not, however, undermined the richness of cultural\r\ndiversity.\r\nCulture and civilization are not static. They\r\nchange, in adaptation to changes in their environment.\r\nThe process of seeking new solutions to emerging\r\nproblems is a continuing one. The absorption of ideas\r\nfrom other cultures assists in this process.\r\nWhile societies adopt the best practices of others,\r\nthey also retain their own uniqueness. They do so\r\nbecause they instinctively feel a sense of belonging and\r\nof inheritance. They also do so because their own\r\ncircumstances are never identical to those of others.\r\nIt has been stated, in some of the documentation\r\nof the Secretariat, that there are two groups of\r\ncivilizations — one which perceives diversity as a\r\nthreat and the other which sees it as an opportunity.\r\nSuch a differentiation is simplistic and dangerous. The\r\ndialogue among civilizations that has taken place over\r\nthe years has eroded the ignorance caused by\r\nethnocentrism and has led to the understanding that all\r\nhuman societies possess their respective civilization\r\nand culture.\r\nIt is but natural that each society would seek to\r\nprotect and preserve its civilizational and cultural\r\nvalues. The dialogue process creates apprehension,\r\neven as it generates expectations. Apprehension is\r\nbased on perceived attempts of one civilization, one\r\nculture — derived from theories of superiority, and its\r\nobverse, inferiority — to overwhelm another. The\r\nunderlying assumption is that the superior will be\r\nstronger and will therefore prevail. Dialogue, however,\r\nleads us to the understanding that there is neither an\r\ninferior nor a superior civilization or culture.\r\nCivilizations are not the same. Each is unique in its\r\nevolution. Yet no one civilization will prevail over the\r\nother. There will be no end of history.\r\nCivilizations are different from one another, but\r\nthere is commonality in their values and achievements.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nEven in times when there was little communication\r\nbetween them, great civilizations of the past, in Asia,\r\nthe Middle East and America, managed to create quite\r\nsimilar irrigation systems. Beyond the shared genetic\r\nmaterial and evolution of technology, there is, and has\r\nalways been, a similarity in approach that different\r\ncivilizations have taken to issues of ethics. This is not\r\nsurprising. Value systems have relevance to human\r\nsituations, and there is the common strand of humanity\r\nwhich threads itself through all these situations. The\r\nright to life, for instance, enjoys primacy in all\r\ncivilizations. There are others. Our dialogue, over the\r\npast half a century, has allowed these to be codified\r\ninto internationally accepted instruments which serve\r\nto promote and protect human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. There is, at the same time, a difference in\r\nemphasis arising from civilizational and cultural ethos.\r\nIt manifests itself in tension generated by the\r\nrecognition of the universality of fundamental human\r\nrights juxtaposed with duties of individuals towards\r\nsociety and societal rights. The Universal Declaration\r\nof Human Rights speaks of rights as well as duties.\r\nThere is, and there will always be, in every civilization,\r\nan attempt to find a balance between the individual and\r\nthe larger common good.\r\nDialogue among civilizations has enlarged the\r\ncommon denominator of values and principles that we\r\nshould be governed by. These include the values of\r\nliberal and participatory democracy, rule of law and\r\ntolerance. They should not be construed as an\r\nimposition, nor should one civilization or another claim\r\nproprietary rights over them. It can be argued, for\r\ninstance, that the village republics of ancient India\r\nwere the enlightened predecessors for modern-day\r\nconcepts of decentralized and participatory political\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIt is this universality of human values that\r\nterrorism denies. The terrorist belongs to no\r\ncivilization. He rejects tolerance and diversity, values\r\ncentral to all civilizations. The perpetrators of the acts\r\nof 11 September — and those who perpetrate acts of\r\nterrorism elsewhere — are the rejects of their own\r\ncivilizations. Their identification can be only with the\r\nStates that harbour, aid, abet and support them, and\r\neven glorify them. To allow terrorists and the States\r\nthat nurture them to hijack our discourse would be to\r\ngive them a legitimacy which belongs only to the\r\ncivilized.\r\nOver the centuries, India has been the meeting\r\nplace of different cultures. The Indic civilization is the\r\nresult of several cultural fusions. It encompasses the\r\nphilosophical tenets of idealism and materialism,\r\nreligion and secularism, an affirmation of its own\r\nidentity and a willingness for integrative globalization.\r\nWe cherish our tolerance; we celebrate our diversity.\r\nWe do so because of our belief in, and acceptance of,\r\nthe fundamental unity of all humanity. As Mahatma\r\nGandhi said:\r\n“I do not want my house to be walled on all\r\nsides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the\r\ncultures of all the lands blown about my house as\r\nfreely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off\r\nmy feet by any of them.”\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations should\r\ncontinue. It will, we hope, contribute to greater\r\nharmony among civilizations.\r\nMr. Al-Awdi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): We are\r\ndebating today one of the most important items on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly, concerning dialogue\r\namong civilizations. My delegation has studied the\r\nreport on this item. In Kuwait the activities provided\r\nfor in the report have given us an understanding of the\r\nimportance attached to this dialogue at the\r\ngovernmental level, and at the level of the United\r\nNations. This leads us to be optimistic about the\r\ndialogue, which will touch on every aspect of our lives.\r\nIn this connection, we in Kuwait are pleased with\r\nthe activities organized by the United Nations to\r\nstrengthen the concept of dialogue among civilizations,\r\nspecifically the decision by the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) to establish this dialogue as a strategic\r\nobjective of its medium-term plan for 2002-2007. We\r\nare also pleased that the personal representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for the Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations has proceeded, in cooperation with\r\nimportant international personalities, to work out an\r\nagenda for the dialogue. This has encouraged a number\r\nof States and non-governmental organizations to\r\ndeploy great efforts to support the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and to develop an international culture of\r\npeace, to which we all aspire. In this connection, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the Arab\r\nLeague and other organizations have also participated.\r\nKuwait has always supported the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations through practical activities, and our\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nGovernment has decided to support all General\r\nAssembly resolutions pertaining to it. We have also\r\ncontinued to carry out important activities and\r\neducational and cultural programmes, in cooperation\r\nwith the rest of the international community, in\r\ncelebrating 2001 as the Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations.\r\nIt is important to underscore a number of other\r\nactivities. Kuwait has signed several international\r\ntreaties in connection with the national and\r\ngovernmental heritages of peoples. It has entered into\r\nbilateral agreements with friendly States to promote\r\ncooperation and exchange of educational and cultural\r\nprogrammes. For many years, Kuwait has been\r\nimplementing programmes and plans at the national\r\nlevel to reinforce directly the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and to create continuous communication\r\nbetween Kuwait and other nations. This has also been\r\naccomplished through cultural programmes, annual arts\r\nfestivals and the participation of Kuwaiti people in the\r\nstrengthening of the dialogue among civilizations.\r\nKuwait, for example, is organizing the al-Qareen\r\ncultural festival, an annual festival for children and an\r\ninternational book fair. It has also cooperated with\r\ninternational organizations and relevant non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the area of human rights\r\nto strengthen international peace and the dialogue\r\namong civilizations. Furthermore, there has been\r\ncooperation with friendly countries in the area of\r\nculture, education and science to develop positive\r\ndialogue among peoples. As the Arab cultural capital\r\nfor 2001, Kuwait has sponsored a number of cultural\r\nand artistic activities and supported the programmes\r\ndeveloped by UNESCO in this connection.\r\nKuwait has hosted 16 cultural programmes and\r\nexhibits, with the participation of the Republic of\r\nKorea, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Switzerland.\r\nMany Arab countries have also participated. My\r\ncountry has also given exhibits abroad, in France,\r\nAlgeria, Iran and Yemen. We are currently working\r\nwith Japan to prepare a dialogue between the Gulf\r\nStates and Japan. We have also played an important\r\nrole, along with the rest of the international\r\ncommunity, in supporting this United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, and my delegation has\r\nreported on it in writing to the Secretary-General.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that,\r\nthrough this Organization, we, like other States, want\r\nto help guarantee peace, security and stability for all\r\nthe peoples of the world. We also want to reiterate our\r\nsupport for the principles of the Charter in this area.\r\nThese are principles that my country has underscored\r\nin the draft resolution to be examined by the General\r\nAssembly in the course of the debate on this agenda\r\nitem. We are fully aware of the positive aspects this\r\ndialogue has at both levels, national and international,\r\nand in the foreign policy of our own Government.\r\nAlso, following the events of 11 September, we wish to\r\ncooperate in the strengthening of this dialogue as a\r\npeaceful one and not as a clash among civilizations, as\r\nsome people would like to portray it these days. It is\r\nindeed imperative to promote true understanding of all\r\nold civilizations, especially Islamic civilization,\r\nrenounce terrorism and create in us, Arabs and\r\nMuslims, an understanding of all cultures and at all\r\nlevels.\r\nLastly, I would like to refer to paragraph 19 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on this item, which is\r\napplicable, especially following the terrorist attacks of\r\n11 September 2001:\r\n“This is all the more true in the aftermath of\r\nthe 11 September terrorist attacks, which\r\nrepresented the worst of humanity, whereas the\r\ndialogue seeks to enable and promote the best in\r\nhumanity. A dialogue among civilizations is not\r\nonly a necessary answer to terrorism — it is in\r\nmany ways its nemesis. Where terrorism seeks to\r\ndivide humanity, the dialogue aims to unite us.”\r\nI would also like to commend the efforts of the\r\nIranian Government regarding this dialogue and the\r\ndraft resolution on this item.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nWhen the United Nations decided in General Assembly\r\nresolution 53/22 of 4 November 1998 to proclaim the\r\nyear 2001 the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, it wanted to underscore the urgent need\r\nto find ways and means to establish an exchange\r\namong the currents of thought, ways of life, cultures\r\nand traditions that constitute the wealth of our peoples.\r\nIn view of the events of 11 September, the choice\r\nof the year 2001 to highlight the virtues of dialogue\r\namong civilizations could not be more significant.\r\nOutrages such as those we have witnessed, in which\r\nreligion and terrorism were blended into a dangerous\r\nbrew, must be forever banned. The present debate on\r\nagenda item 25 gives us that opportunity. This debate,\r\nor this exchange of views, affords us the opportunity to\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nreiterate to the world that only understanding among\r\npeople can promote peace and human progress.\r\nWe are grateful to the Islamic Republic of Iran for\r\nits initiative, which has allowed us to approach this\r\nreality in all its breadth. In fact, the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is, in the final analysis, the only weapon\r\ncapable of creating a climate of peace, security and\r\ntrust among peoples and nations, because it makes it\r\npossible for people to know each other better and\r\ntherefore promotes better understanding among people.\r\nThe objective of international peace and security could\r\nnot be attained exclusively on the basis of disarmament\r\nor peacekeeping, peace-building conflict management\r\noperations, however useful and praiseworthy they may\r\nbe. We must add another decisive element and that\r\ntakes into account the sociological, spiritual, cultural\r\nand behavioural dimensions of human beings.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations indisputably\r\nhelps to prevent conflict by serving as a means of re-\r\nestablishing communication among human beings,\r\ncommunities, peoples and nations, which are, of\r\ncourse, the potential bearers of violence and insecurity.\r\nAs such, it makes a great contribution to the\r\npacification of inter-community and international\r\nrelations.\r\nAt a time when communications technology has\r\nreduced the world to a global village, at a time when\r\nthe globalized economy obliges people to become more\r\nclose and more integrated, thus creating new\r\ninterdependencies, the United Nations must play a\r\nfederative role for all Member States and provide\r\nleadership in the dialogue among civilizations.\r\nHumanity is at a crossroads, and all of us\r\ntogether, moved and concerned by the same ideals of\r\nthe United Nations, must mobilize ourselves to\r\nstrengthen our determination to win the fight for peace,\r\nsecurity and stability, as well as the fight against\r\npoverty, exclusion, intolerance and hatred.\r\nAllow me to take this occasion to share the\r\nexperience of my country, Burkina Faso, which has a\r\ncultural tradition called parenté à plaisanterie that is a\r\nfactor of peaceful social regulation of relations among\r\nour cultural communities. As such, it is a good example\r\nof fraternal dialogue. Burkina Faso has about 60 ethnic\r\ngroups and many religious communities that coexist in\r\nharmony.\r\nParenté à plaisanterie is a means of\r\ncommunication between two, three or more ethnic\r\ngroups, or within an ethnic group. This tradition allows\r\nall sorts of jokes to be played, on happy or unhappy\r\noccasions, no matter the age or the social, political or\r\nadministrative rank of the persons involved. For\r\nexample, a 10-year-old child can make fun of a person\r\nof 70 years of age or more, or even with a group of\r\npersons, and no fighting will result. Even better, this\r\nform of dialogue creates a fine ambience, as one joke\r\nfollows another. Confrontations are often avoided\r\namong people when they discover that they are related\r\nthrough parenté à plaisanterie, because the family\r\nname alone is enough to immediately identify an\r\n“antagonist”.\r\nWith regard to religion, various communities,\r\nincluding Islamic, animist and Christian, live in perfect\r\nunderstanding and often cooperate to contribute to the\r\npreservation of peace, harmony and stability in our\r\ncountry. On the holidays of one of the communities, the\r\nothers offer their best wishes, and it is not unusual to\r\nsee Muslims celebrating Christmas or Christians\r\ncelebrating Mawlid.\r\nThis rapprochement of cultures and religions\r\nthrough dialogue is a factor for peace and friendship,\r\nand we must all support it.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations, as a\r\ntranscendental value, requires, quite obviously,\r\ntolerance, acceptance and respect for others, for their\r\nway of thinking, of living and of behaving. All this\r\nmust take root in our societies, in our customs and in\r\nour day-to-day existence. In other words, the\r\npromotion of a true dialogue among civilizations must\r\nfirst pass through the culture of dialogue, which each\r\none of us should consider a cardinal rule. This is the\r\ncondition sine qua non for arriving at the universal\r\ncivilization that we long for.\r\nAs a co-sponsor of draft resolution A/56/L.3,\r\nentitled “Global agenda for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations”, Burkina Faso wants to align itself with\r\nthat goal. It reaffirms its wholehearted support for the\r\nprocess of dialogue and also for implementing the\r\nprogramme that is to be adopted.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Singapore.\r\nMs. Tan Yee Woan (Singapore): We meet at a\r\ntime when the dialogue among civilizations is being\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nthreatened by extremists more eager to kill than to talk.\r\nPublic statements have been made in support of\r\nviolence and murder. Worse, they joyfully assert a state\r\nof war between civilizations.\r\nThese statements are false. They are a deliberate,\r\nirresponsible provocation. As representatives of the\r\ninternational community, it is our duty to clearly and\r\ndecisively rebut them with our words, and refute them\r\nby our actions.\r\nPerhaps we should re-examine the phrase\r\n“dialogue among civilizations”. A dialogue, by\r\ndefinition, is a discussion between two parties only. We\r\nare engaged in a global conversation with many\r\nparticipants. Consequently, dialogue must be carried\r\nout at many levels — not all, or even mostly, at the\r\nlevel of Governments. In fact, the political level may\r\nbe the least important of all. States have always\r\nunderstood the need to keep in contact with each other\r\nin their own strategic interests. They can be relied upon\r\nto carry on doing so.\r\nCivilizations are not monolithic entities with\r\ndetermined borders. Civilizations are more than\r\nreligion. A civilization is a dynamic mixture of history,\r\ngeography, ethnicity, ethics, philosophy, religion,\r\npolitics, economics, custom, tradition, cuisine,\r\naesthetics, habits and fashion. Because of this, the\r\nmore important dialogue is the one among ordinary\r\nindividuals. This is embodied in the millions of\r\nintergovernmental, commercial, educational, scholarly\r\nand purely social interactions that go on all over the\r\nworld. This dialogue takes place at every moment of\r\nevery hour of every day. It has become deeper, richer\r\nand far more extensive in the last 10 years with the\r\nspread of communications technology and\r\nglobalization. In these uncertain times, it is vitally\r\nimportant that we do not allow fear to weaken this\r\nglobal network of contacts.\r\nTrade and commerce may well be the most\r\nimportant of the many possible levels of contact among\r\ncivilizations. Historically, the principal peaceful\r\ncontact among civilizations was through trade. Since\r\nantiquity, the famous Silk Road linked the Chinese\r\nEmpire at its eastern end with the Roman Empire at its\r\nwestern terminus, with dozens of different societies in\r\nbetween. Even now, for many of us, commercial and\r\nprofessional dealings are still our main avenues of\r\ncontact with people different from ourselves. Over the\r\nlast 10 years, global economic integration through\r\nliberalized trade and foreign direct investment has\r\nincreased substantially. This has in turn deepened our\r\nopportunities to interact peacefully with people outside\r\nour own societies and cultures.\r\nIt is important not only to avoid reducing such\r\ninteractions, but also to extend and deepen them. It is\r\nstill the case that developed countries tend to trade and\r\ninvest among themselves. From 1998-2000, 76.3 per\r\ncent of foreign direct investment flows went to\r\ndeveloped countries, and only 21.4 per cent to\r\ndeveloping countries. Now that the world economy is\r\nin a shaky state, it is likely that this discrepancy will\r\nwiden. Both developed and developing countries must\r\ndo their utmost to reverse this phenomenon by\r\nliberalizing trade, reducing barriers to imports and\r\nassisting developing countries to create the necessary\r\nsocial, legal and physical infrastructure to encourage\r\nforeign investment. Developing countries want and\r\nneed more integration, not less. They want to be able to\r\nparticipate fully in the global conversation.\r\nThe movement of people is a major, albeit\r\ninvoluntary, force in the dialogue among civilizations.\r\nThe International Labour Organization estimates that,\r\nas of 1999, there were up to 97 million people living\r\nand working in countries other than those of their birth.\r\nThis does not include the approximately 11.5 million\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons estimated by\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR) at the end of 1998.\r\nEvery society has foreigners living and working\r\nin it. This is a vital source of both economic prosperity\r\nand cultural interchange. The anxiety caused by the\r\nthreat of terrorism has already led to increased\r\nxenophobia and calls for restrictions upon immigration\r\nin many countries. Both developed and developing\r\ncountries will suffer if the flow of people and skills is\r\nfurther limited.\r\nThere is no State or civilization in the world that\r\ncan honestly claim to be ethnically, culturally,\r\nreligiously or socially homogeneous. The civilizations\r\nof the world are no longer separate entities, but are\r\ninextricably intertwined with each other, both\r\nculturally and geographically. In the last 100 years,\r\nthere have been many misguided attempts to create\r\nsocieties that were ethnically, religiously or politically\r\n“pure”. These resulted in nothing but bloodshed,\r\nsuffering and death for millions of people — an\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\noutcome that should logically persuade us of the\r\nfutility and evil consequences of such endeavours.\r\nWe must not fall into the trap of thinking of a\r\ncivilization as something static, fixed and\r\nunchangeable. As the Secretary-General recently said:\r\n“... these terms — civilizations, cultures — are\r\nnot constant or immutable facts of history, but\r\nrather organisms in constant flux — always\r\nchanging, growing, developing and adapting\r\nthemselves to new times and new realities\r\nthrough interaction with each other”. (Adapted\r\nfrom a speech at Seton Hall University’s School\r\nof Diplomacy and International Relations,\r\n5 February 2001)\r\nModern Singapore has flourished throughout its\r\n200-year history as a consequence of the fruitful and\r\nprofitable interchange among the many different ethnic\r\ngroups that live and work there. Each group, while\r\nretaining a strong sense of its own history and identity,\r\nhas nonetheless adapted and evolved in response to\r\ncontact with all the others. In this sense, Singapore is a\r\nmicrocosm of South-East Asia as a whole. Our region\r\nis one of the world’s great crossroads of East and West,\r\nNorth and South. Over the centuries, influences from\r\nChina, India, the Arabian peninsula and Europe have\r\nall met and mingled there. The situation is the same\r\ntoday, except that the influences are now from all over\r\nthe world.\r\nBoth now and in the past, the strongest and most\r\nresilient societies have been those that can\r\naccommodate different strands of thought, opinion and\r\nbehaviour. Culturally homogeneous societies, like\r\nfields of homogeneous crops, are vulnerable to sudden\r\nchanges in their external environment. If a field is\r\nplanted with just one species of crop, an insect\r\ninfestation may kill every plant in it. In a field of\r\nmixed species, many plants will be unaffected by the\r\npest, and the crop as a whole will survive.\r\nLike any living species, societies and civilizations\r\nare in a state of continuous evolutionary change. To\r\nstop evolution does not mean that a species has reached\r\nperfection; to stop evolution means extinction. A\r\nculture that shuns diversity and closes itself off into its\r\nown airtight cocoon of ideas and beliefs will not grow\r\nand change into a butterfly; it will suffocate and die.\r\nAny contribution that it might have made to human\r\ndevelopment will die with it. A society that feeds its\r\nmembers on fear and hatred of what is different is\r\nsowing the seeds of its own destruction.\r\nThe average length of time for a living species to\r\nexist is a million years. However, there are two ways in\r\nwhich a species can disappear. One is by complete\r\nextinction, without leaving any genetic inheritance\r\nbehind. The other is by changing into something else,\r\nas some dinosaurs may have evolved into birds. Human\r\nsocieties also have these two possibilities before them\r\nat all times. No society still in existence today is the\r\nsame as it was 100, or 1,000, years ago. Through\r\ninteraction with other civilizations, each civilization\r\nchanges, grows and lives. In maintaining and\r\nstrengthening the dialogue among civilizations, we are\r\nchoosing the road to survival, not extinction.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ndialogue among civilizations has never been as\r\nimportant as it is today. That dialogue began a number\r\nof years ago with the proposal of a philosophical idea\r\naimed at bringing civilizations closer together in order\r\nto counteract what was then referred to as the\r\ninevitable differences and clashes between\r\ncivilizations. We have now witnessed astonishing\r\nevents that have compelled us to change our approach\r\nto the issue. Today, we view the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations as a practical necessity because of our\r\ncommon fate, and not as a philosophical debate, which\r\nbelongs to the domain of research and books. Today,\r\nmore than ever before, we need a serious dialogue that\r\nbrings us together and aims to achieve and promote\r\ncoexistence, rather than one that seeks to pull us apart.\r\nWe need a dialogue that establishes a framework for\r\nour unification and counters calls for divergence and\r\nisolation.\r\nWe must still define the meaning of civilization,\r\nas well as the ideas and concepts that link it to other\r\nconcepts, such as culture, nationalism, religion and\r\nother elements. True, it is difficult to agree on a clear\r\ndefinition for a notion such as civilization. But, in fact,\r\ncivilization has several definitions and interpretations,\r\nmost of which are based on a combination of historical\r\nand geographical elements and the interplay between\r\nthem — which includes language, culture events and\r\ntastes. The resulting intellectual mixture has brought\r\ntogether people of various faiths and nationalities that\r\nhave coexisted and clashed for a long time across vast\r\ngeographical regions. We understand that civilization is\r\nsomething that results from a meeting of wills that\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nrepresent a true vision of all these elements and their\r\ninteraction.\r\nThe dialogue among civilization begins, first and\r\nforemost, with the idea of the equality of all\r\ncivilizations and an appreciation of the contribution\r\nevery civilization can make to the destiny of mankind\r\nthrough its unique knowledge and history, without\r\npretending to be racist or superior to any other\r\ncivilization. Dialogue begins with an understanding of\r\nthe special characteristics and diversity of each\r\ncivilization in the light of its own experience and\r\nsources of nourishment and the distinct traditions and\r\ncustoms it has developed throughout the years. The\r\nhuman legacy of all civilizations is certainly rich in\r\nelements that can bring us together and in values\r\ncommon to all cultures. This can help us to counter the\r\nconflict between civilizations. We can base ourselves\r\non this heritage to highlight the salient points of our\r\ncommon destiny and the fundamental points upon\r\nwhich to build the dialogue. Allow me to list some of\r\nthose.\r\nFirst, all civilizations, despite their diversity, are\r\npart and parcel of a unique system, namely, human\r\ncivilization. Development and progress in a given\r\nregion or civilization will ultimately result in\r\nnourishing other civilizations.\r\nSecondly, humankind has not made the progress it\r\nhas through the efforts of a single civilization. All\r\ncivilizations have together built an intricate structure\r\nthrough a long cumulative process to create such a\r\nhuman fabric.\r\nThirdly, the best place to begin the dialogue\r\namong civilizations is within a dialogue that takes\r\nplace among individual civilizations. In fact, within\r\nany given civilization there are numerous nationalities,\r\nreligions, languages, dialects and so on. One cannot\r\npossibly conceive of coexistence among civilizations\r\nwithout their first coexisting within the same\r\ncivilization.\r\nFourthly, each civilization must go through a\r\nprocess of purification by eliminating all negative\r\naspects and feelings of superiority and by shunning\r\nconcepts that resist sound logic and thinking.\r\nFifthly, we must understand the importance of\r\naccepting the other, and not rejecting it because of\r\ndifferent beliefs, lifestyles, and ways of life.\r\nThe best expression of Egypt’s vision of the\r\ndialogue among civilizations was enunciated by\r\nPresident Mubarak during the Euro-Mediterranean\r\nForum, which took place in Spain just a few days ago.\r\nHe stated that we must understand that religion cannot\r\nbe used as a pretext for conflict among civilizations or\r\nconfrontation among peoples. Every religion should\r\nserve as the driving force for dialogue and coexistence\r\namong people. As President Mubarak has also\r\nstressed — which we Muslims are very proud of —\r\nMuslims were not the only ones to spearhead progress\r\nin the Arab-Islamic civilization; the Christians and\r\nJews living in the fold of that civilization were also\r\nvery instrumental. They made a very important\r\ncontribution, which reaffirms the noble foundation of\r\nthe Arab-Islamic civilization and highlights its spirit of\r\ntolerance and acceptance of others, away from the\r\nclaims of conflict and supremacy.\r\nMr. Ling (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus welcomes the\r\ndiscussion on the item of the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations on the eve of the general debate of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Such a\r\nschedule enables us not only to discuss this important\r\nagenda item at the current session, but also to establish\r\nvery logical links between the work of Assembly\r\nmeetings and the forthcoming exchange of opinions at\r\nthe level of heads of State or Government and Foreign\r\nMinisters on the most pressing issues today.\r\nIt is very symbolic that the United Nations Year\r\nof Dialogue among Civilizations has coincided with the\r\nbeginning of the new century and millennium. Now is\r\njust the time for humankind to give particular attention\r\nto reviewing the entire spectrum of diversity among\r\ncivilizations, their common characteristics and\r\ndifferences, which are, in the aggregate, a great legacy\r\nof world society. Under current circumstances, in\r\nmarking the beginning of a new era in international\r\nrelations — the era of globalization — it is important\r\nto realize that dialogue, exchange and interaction\r\nbetween the histories, cultures and social traditions of\r\ndifferent States, united into a single family of the\r\nnations of the world, are the real — not an abstract —\r\ndriving force of the progress of human society and that\r\nthis has been an irreversible trend in historical\r\ndevelopment in all preceding centuries and millennia.\r\nExchange among civilizations will contribute to the\r\nworld’s future prosperity.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nIt is not coincidental that following the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001 in major United States\r\ncities, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in his address to\r\ndelegates at the 1st plenary meeting of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, made a specific\r\nreference to dialogue among civilizations. Belarus is\r\nconvinced that the unprecedented acts of terrorism\r\nwere possible only because the terrorists ignored the\r\nfundamental preconditions for the civilized coexistence\r\nof States in today’s world: continual exchange and\r\ninteraction. Different incentives, based on the\r\nsuperiority of some and the inferiority of others, on\r\nracial, religious or national differences, could lead to\r\nunforeseeable consequences. We should enrich one\r\nanother, learn from one another, exchange expertise\r\nand cooperate on the basis of equality and mutual\r\nrespect. Only thus will we be able to settle all existing\r\ndifferences, by peaceful means, on the basis of mutual\r\ntrust, harmony and understanding. Certainly this will\r\nbe difficult to achieve, but it is possible.\r\nUnfortunately, the high level of mankind’s\r\ndevelopment at present does not yet ensure full\r\nharmony and perfection in the contemporary world.\r\nOur world is full of conflicts, environmental problems\r\nand social upheaval. There is concern about the\r\nincreasing acceleration of military spending against the\r\nbackground of a growing gap between the developed\r\nand developing world, an increasing number of\r\nrefugees, civilian casualties, increasing involvement of\r\nchildren in armed conflict, the expansion of the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic and other challenges and shocks.\r\nAgainst that background, it should be noted that\r\nmany modern conflicts are precisely at the crossroads\r\nof indigenous civilizations. The situations in Kosovo\r\nand in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the critical\r\nconditions in the Middle East and Afghanistan are just\r\nsome examples where dialogue and reconciliation\r\namong religions, cultures, nations and traditions\r\nbecome crucial in the search for a peaceful settlement,\r\nand, consequently, in ensuring the sustainable and\r\npredictable development of world society today and in\r\nthe future.\r\nAs the trend towards globalization intensifies, it\r\nbecomes extremely important to broaden true\r\ndemocracy and equality in international relations, to\r\nachieve understanding of the equal rights of all\r\ncountries — large and small, rich and poor — in order\r\nto attain our common goals. In our view, it is precisely\r\nin this context that the issue of combating international\r\nterrorism should be considered. The efforts of the\r\nSecurity Council Counter-terrorism Committee,\r\nestablished pursuant to Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nwhich focuses on achieving broad support among\r\nMember States, should be continued and enhanced. The\r\nopinions of all countries must be taken into account as\r\nmuch as possible at all stages of the work of that\r\nimportant organ. For us, this is the precondition for the\r\nCommittee’s success and therefore the real prospect for\r\nestablishing a reliable shield against international\r\nterrorists.\r\nBelarus shares the concept of the key role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the process of encouraging dialogue\r\namong civilizations. We support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s point that\r\n“The United Nations itself was created in the\r\nbelief that dialogue can triumph over discord, that\r\ndiversity is a universal virtue and that the peoples\r\nof the world are far more united by their common\r\nfate than they are divided by their separate\r\nidentities.”\r\nProceeding from this position, we have joined the\r\nsponsors of the General Assembly draft resolution that\r\ncontains the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. With its adoption, it will be easier for the\r\nUnited Nations to take further action in this field and to\r\nexclude the possibility of inconsistent and sporadic\r\nmeasures.\r\nBelarus is convinced that only practical steps\r\ntaken by all Member States can facilitate achievement\r\nof the goals we are setting for ourselves today. In this\r\nregard, the people of Belarus and the President and\r\nGovernment prefer to follow the ancient wisdom that\r\none should start with oneself. Today’s Belarus is a\r\ndialogue among civilizations in miniature. We have\r\nrepresentatives of more than 140 ethnic minorities in\r\nthe country, and all of them enjoy the right to develop\r\nfreely and promote their culture, history and language.\r\nTwenty-six major religious confessions are registered\r\nin Belarus. The relationship among different\r\nconfessions and nationalities in the country can be\r\ndefined as stable and predictable.\r\nThe results of scientific and sociological research\r\nclearly indicate that there are no objective grounds in\r\nBelarus for social or psychological tensions or conflicts\r\nin the area of ethnic relations. They also show that,\r\nagainst the background of well-established traditions,\r\nwe have sustainable interaction between the\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\npredominant national group and the other groups —\r\nRussians, Ukrainians, Poles, Jews, Tatars and others.\r\nThe practice of organizing round tables with the\r\nparticipation of representatives of ethnic minorities and\r\nencouraging national cultural festivals and inter-ethnic\r\nscientific contacts has been a longstanding tradition in\r\nBelarus. With the establishment of the Commonwealth\r\nof Independent States, Belarus has been actively\r\nparticipating in all integration initiatives from the\r\nformer Soviet Union, considering them a necessary\r\nprerequisite for the stable economic and political\r\ndevelopment of the newly independent nations that\r\nformerly constituted a single State. We are interested in\r\ndeveloping this strategy in the future.\r\nIt is an honour for me to extend, on behalf of my\r\nGovernment, sincere gratitude to the representative of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, personally to the\r\nPresident of this tradition-rich country, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mohammad Khatami, Mr. Kofi Annan and his\r\nPersonal Representative, Mr. Giandomenico Picco, for\r\ntheir valuable contribution in promoting the noble idea\r\nof the dialogue among civilizations. Belarus will\r\ncontribute to further the development and success of\r\nthis initiative.\r\nMr. Satoh (Japan): At the outset, I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to express, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Japan, our sincere appreciation to the\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, His\r\nExcellency Seyed Mohammad Khatami, for proposing\r\nthis dialogue among civilizations.\r\nI would also like to express our gratitude to\r\nMr. Giandomenico Picco, the personal representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General, and to the group of eminent\r\npersons appointed by the Secretary-General for\r\npublishing the book entitled Crossing the Divide:\r\nDialogue among Civilizations. This book is one of the\r\nconcrete achievements of the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations.\r\nThe United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations is an epoch-making undertaking with\r\nhistoric significance. It has urged countries and peoples\r\naround the world to seek peace and coexistence\r\nthrough dialogue based upon a spirit of mutual\r\nunderstanding and tolerance. It is most ironic,\r\ntherefore, that the heinous terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember made it known to us in the cruellest manner\r\nthe magnitude of yet another threat to civilization:\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe international community must cooperate to\r\neradicate such terrorist attacks. In this context, it was `\r\nvery encouraging that at the plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, 171 representatives united in\r\ncondemning terrorism and in emphasizing the need to\r\nprevent and eradicate terrorism. At the same time, it\r\ncannot be overemphasized that it is terrorists whom we\r\nconfront, not Muslims, or Islamic or Arab countries.\r\nIn January of this United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, the Government of\r\nJapan, under the leadership of the then Foreign\r\nMinister, Mr. Yohei Kono, launched a new initiative\r\nthat seeks to further enhance mutual understanding\r\nbetween Japan and Islamic countries as part of the\r\neffort to promote dialogue among civilizations. Under\r\nthis initiative, the Government of Japan has been\r\nundertaking a series of new efforts aimed at deepening\r\nthe understanding of Islam and has created a network\r\nof intellectuals among people in Japan and the Islamic\r\ncountries. As a result of these efforts, a network\r\nseminar is to be convened in Bahrain in March 2002.\r\nThe Government of Japan also hosted a seminar in\r\nTokyo last March entitled “Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations — From a Century of Conflict to a\r\nCentury of Coexistence”, where many young people\r\nfrom various countries were invited to discuss global\r\nissues. The seminar produced a report, which was\r\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General.\r\nToday, in the light of these efforts by Japan, I\r\nwould like to present the views of my Government on\r\nthe dialogue among civilizations. It may be said that,\r\nviewed historically, the world of today is the result of\r\ninteraction among civilizations around the globe.\r\nAlthough conflicts have sometimes occurred as a\r\nconsequence of this interaction, there is no doubt that\r\nevery civilization has been stimulated and enriched\r\nthrough its interaction with others. Located at the\r\neastern edge of Asia, Japan has assimilated into its own\r\nculture aspects of various civilizations in the course of\r\nits long history; accordingly, we can readily understand\r\nthe significance of such interaction. From our own\r\nhistorical experience, we clearly recognize that an\r\nunderstanding of different religions, cultures, customs\r\nand so on, and a tolerance that accepts them, are\r\nessential in order to reap the benefits of interaction\r\nbetween civilizations.\r\nToday it is again becoming important that\r\ndifferent civilizations not compete for ascendancy, but,\r\nrather, that they recognize the differences among\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nthemselves and demonstrate mutual respect through\r\ndialogue and exchanges.\r\nAs globalization continues to advance, goods,\r\nmoney, information and people move from place to\r\nplace at greater speeds and over longer distances than\r\never before. As a result, different civilizations come\r\ninto contact with each other in a very short span of\r\ntime and in such a way as to involve entire societies.\r\nFurthermore, globalization, while bringing many\r\nbenefits to a society, gives rise to various differences\r\nwithin it, which complicates the way people react to\r\nincoming new ways of thinking, cultures and customs.\r\nThis sometimes engenders intolerance among people\r\ntowards civilizations different from their own, and it\r\ncan even result in conflict.\r\nGlobalization, however, is a reality that cannot be\r\nstopped. The Government of Japan considers it\r\nimportant that people acknowledge this fact and\r\nunderstand and respect the religions that others believe\r\nin and the cultures and customs that others hold dear.\r\nWith this recognition, we believe that it is of utmost\r\nimportance to promote exchange, especially among\r\nyoung people who will shoulder responsibility for the\r\nfuture of the world.\r\nIt is important to disseminate knowledge about\r\nvarious civilizations. But more fundamentally, it is\r\nimportant for people all around the world to recognize\r\nthat those who live in different parts of the world and\r\nare of different races, religions, cultures and customs,\r\nare human beings no different from themselves.\r\nPersonal exchanges are essential in order to deepen\r\nsuch recognition.\r\nThe United Nations Millennium Declaration\r\nstates that tolerance is essential to international\r\nrelations in the twenty-first century. In other words,\r\nhuman beings must respect one another in all their\r\ndiversity of belief, culture and language, and a culture\r\nof peace and dialogue among civilizations should be\r\nactively promoted.\r\nIt is our responsibility to achieve this goal to\r\nwhich all the leaders of all Member States have\r\nsubscribed. Indeed, the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations has provided us with an\r\nopportunity for this purpose. In the coming years, we\r\nwill have to continue to make further efforts in close\r\ncooperation with each other in order to expand\r\ndialogues and exchanges among civilizations on the\r\nbasis of their achievements during this United Nations\r\nYear.\r\nI would therefore like to conclude my remarks by\r\nstating that it is with this recognition that the\r\nGovernment of Japan, for its part, will continue to\r\nmake every possible effort in that respect.\r\nMr. Shobokshi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nHumankind had hoped that the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury would create an appropriate opportunity for the\r\nworld to recall events of the past century, evaluate its\r\ngreat victories and outstanding achievements, look at\r\nand draw lessons from its deadly disasters and bloody\r\ntragedies. Humankind aspires to make this century one\r\nof tolerance, cooperation and solidarity that will\r\nstrengthen the human edifice and extend security,\r\npeace, progress and prosperity to all.\r\nYet, the international community was horrified by\r\nthe disaster that befell the United States and shocked\r\nby that murderous and terrorist act, which was\r\ncondemned by all peace-loving peoples and responsible\r\nGovernments. Chief among those were the Arab and\r\nMuslim Governments that have been stung by terrorism\r\nand have suffered from extremism and violence.\r\nIt is regrettable that there are latent forces in the\r\nWest that lie in wait for Islam and the Arabs, see in\r\nMuslims and Arabs the real antagonists to the spirit of\r\nthe times and link them to terrorism. They have\r\nsubstituted the so-called green peril — Islam — for the\r\nred menace. Some of these tendentious forces claim\r\nthat the catastrophe in New York and Washington,\r\nD.C., is sufficient proof that the theory that the values\r\nof conformity, harmony and relative advantage can be\r\nglobalized does not apply to the Muslim and Arab\r\nworlds, which are propelled by hatred of Western\r\nvalues to the extent that some individuals from those\r\nworlds are prepared to face death, to inflict great\r\nsuffering on the innocent and to threaten to destroy\r\nWestern societies.\r\nSuch tendentious individuals ignore the fact that\r\nterrorism is an international phenomenon that is not\r\nlimited to any one nation, race or religion and that it\r\nhas been present in every culture and nation throughout\r\nhistory. They ignore the fact that the region that they\r\naccuse of hatred is the cradle of the divine religions,\r\nwhich taught the world love and tolerance, and whose\r\npeoples have made great contributions to human\r\ncivilization. Terrorism cannot be an Islamic or Arab\r\nphenomenon, as some claim to justify their political\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nends. The liberal and socialist West and the East with\r\nits diverse nations and countries have numerous\r\nextremist and terrorist movements. Every culture is\r\nsubject to those who misrepresent it in a biased manner\r\nand whose interpretation of it is at great odds with\r\nreality, history and truth.\r\nThe latest terrorist acts and their attendant results,\r\nwhich have negatively affected human communications\r\nand revived the concept of a so-called conflict among\r\ncivilizations, underscore the need to pursue the\r\ndialogue among civilizations and interaction among\r\ncultures to bridge the gaps of ideas and values that\r\nbiased people seek to widen.\r\nThose who theorize about the concept of conflict\r\namong civilizations and claim that history is a product\r\nof violence start from the premise that conflict is the\r\nbasis for relations between individuals, peoples and\r\nStates, reflects the nature of human instinct and that it\r\ncharacterizes the state of interaction and competition\r\namong human societies.\r\nThe truth confirms, however, that conflicts are\r\nmotivated by the quest for self-interest, benefits and\r\nobjectives, and that violence, coupled with hatred and\r\ncruelty, arises when a domineering and tyrannical\r\nPower unilaterally prioritizes its own economic\r\ninterests and political objectives. Violence also arises\r\nwherever justice and fairness are lacking and whenever\r\nthe practice of double standards is the norm in\r\ninternational relations. Extremism, which spurs\r\nindividuals to violence, is the result of shortcomings\r\nthat govern human and international relations at the\r\nexpense of great human values and the natural rights of\r\npeoples. Extremism, violence and terrorism are the\r\nresult of excessive oppression and the lack of freedom\r\nand justice.\r\nThe international community, represented by its\r\nGovernments, institutions and regional and\r\ninternational organizations — the United Nations first\r\nand foremost among them — should work as one to\r\ntrace the roots of terrorism, understand its causes and\r\npursue efforts to find just solutions to various conflicts.\r\nUprooting terrorism, draining its resources and\r\neliminating its centres requires international political\r\naction based on justice and equality among peoples.\r\nResentment of double standards is one of the\r\nreasons for random and organized violence under the\r\numbrella of terrorism. Only justice will generate peace\r\nand make all peoples realize that they are living in an\r\ninternational order that respects everyone and\r\ndiscriminates against none. Civilizations are\r\ninstruments that have been built on interaction among\r\ncultures and on the amalgamation of human knowledge\r\nsince God created and populated this planet, and will\r\nremain so until God reclaims it and everything on it.\r\nDialogue among the judicious and the wise has\r\nbecome an urgent necessity if we are to avoid a\r\ndownfall. The events of 11 September have shown that\r\ncertain historical sensitivities still linger in the\r\nsubconscious of the nations of the East and the West.\r\nWe have been surprised by the numerous rifts that have\r\nopened and by how certain holdovers from the past,\r\nwith its attendant hatred, have begun to emerge. We\r\nhave also begun to read and hear about idiotic\r\nclassifications of religions, civilizations and cultures.\r\nWhile we cannot change the past, we have to\r\nwork together for the future. We have to endeavour to\r\nfind an enlightened cultural vision that emphasizes the\r\npositive aspects of international relations and the\r\ncontribution of the United Nations to building the\r\npresent and preparing for the future. The world has also\r\nchanged. States are no longer a pure expression of a\r\nspecific culture or religion, because interaction among\r\npeoples does not recognize religious differences and\r\nthe unity of the human race transcends racial divisions.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls for\r\ncontinuing the dialogue among civilizations and for\r\nopening cultural communications, understanding and\r\ninternational cooperation because of its belief in God’s\r\nwords:\r\n“O mankind! We created\r\nYou from a single (pair)\r\nOf a male and a female,\r\nAnd made you into\r\nNations and tribes, that\r\nYe may know each other.\r\nVerily,\r\nThe most honoured of you\r\nIn the sight of Allah\r\nIs (he who is) the most\r\nRighteous of you.” (The Holy Koran, IL:13)\r\nWalls of isolation, preconceptions of others, racist\r\nepithets, derision of other people’s values, religions,\r\nsects and beliefs, feelings of superiority and hateful\r\nselfishness are not the teachings of the Koran. The\r\nnature of humanity is exploration, interaction and\r\ncooperation among human beings in the interests of all,\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nwhich requires acknowledging the rights, beliefs and\r\nvalues of others.\r\nBelieving in the significance of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and cultures, the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia established the first dialogue between Muslims\r\nand the Vatican more than 25 years ago. It also\r\nestablished numerous cultural centres and scientific\r\ninstitutes around the world to function as a bridge\r\nbetween Islamic and other cultures. The objective is to\r\ndeepen understanding and to establish a common\r\nfoundation of values and objectives to enhance human\r\ncalls for peace and cooperation.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls for a dialogue\r\nbased on mutual respect among different cultures and\r\nthat is not bound by history so to ensure that the\r\ndialogue is not confined to issues that have no relation\r\nto the present. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls for a\r\ndialogue that cultivates and enlightens the mind and\r\naddresses humanitarian issues and awareness. It calls\r\nfor solutions and compromises inspired by the spirit of\r\ncivilization, based on equality and justice, and founded\r\non values, ideals and principles. Saudi Arabia is calling\r\nfor a dialogue that helps to bring nations together and\r\nto eliminate the barriers of misunderstanding, mistrust,\r\nmisconceptions and prejudice that have accumulated\r\nover time. We are calling for a wise dialogue to\r\nrationalize and control globalization and to ensure that\r\nit is not transformed from a mechanism that fosters\r\ninteraction between civilizations and cultures and that\r\npromotes knowledge into a single, monolithic culture\r\nfounded on the ruins of others. It should not result in\r\nthe imposition of certain values on others without due\r\nconsideration for their beliefs and cultural heritage.\r\nWe live in a world of interdependent relations,\r\ninterests and benefits. That is why humankind should\r\ncooperate creatively and develop plans and\r\nprogrammes at the international level to respond to the\r\nthreats that we all face. No nation can separate itself\r\nfrom the problems of the world. We must work\r\ntogether to create a world free from war, conflict,\r\nextremism and terrorism, as well as from disease,\r\nignorance and poverty — one in which justice and\r\nequality prevail to ensure a better and more stable,\r\nhumanistic and prosperous future for coming\r\ngenerations.\r\nMr. Arrouchi (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like, on behalf of the kingdom of Morocco, to\r\nthank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan; his\r\nPersonal Representative, Mr. Giandomenico Picco; the\r\nGroup of Eminent Persons; and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) for their tireless efforts to promote and\r\nstrengthen the idea of a dialogue among civilizations.\r\nWe would also like to thank the delegation of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, which has, with great\r\neffectiveness and success, led the work of the group of\r\nexperts, whose task was to elaborate the draft\r\nProgramme of Action for the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, which Morocco supports.\r\nThe principle of dialogue is one of the\r\nfundamental tenets of Islamic society, which has\r\nalways favoured understanding and openness among\r\npeoples. As the Almighty said,\r\n“O Mankind! We created\r\nYou from a single (pair)\r\nOf a male and a female,\r\nAnd made you into\r\nNations and tribes, that\r\nYe may know each other”. (Holy Koran, IL:13)\r\nOur Organization came about as the result of a\r\nconstructive dialogue undertaken 56 years ago between\r\nmany nations, representing different civilizations.\r\nThese nations declared that they were determined to\r\npreserve future generations from the scourge of war, to\r\npractise tolerance and to coexist peacefully with each\r\nother in a spirit of good-neighbourliness. These noble\r\nobjectives can be achieved only through the promotion\r\nof a culture of dialogue among civilizations — a\r\ndialogue that is more necessary than ever, because of\r\nglobalization, which is increasingly revealing the depth\r\nand complexity of human diversity in all its aspects.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco’s unshakeable\r\nconviction in the beneficial nature of dialogue is based\r\non its history of international relations. In fact, as His\r\nMajesty King Mohammed VI stressed in his message to\r\nparticipants in the International Symposium on\r\nDialogue among Civilizations in a Changing World,\r\norganized by the Islamic Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization, Morocco has always been, and\r\nremains, a crossroads of tolerance and coexistence, a\r\nsafe haven of understanding and a starting point for the\r\nestablishment of channels of communication at the\r\ncivilizational and cultural levels among different\r\nsocieties, regardless of the diversity of their religions\r\nand beliefs and their many different origins.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nThe particular geographical location of Morocco,\r\nwhich makes it a point of contact between Europe, the\r\nArab world and sub-Saharan Africa, has to a great\r\nextent determined the identity of the country. The epic\r\nAndalusian period in our history is part of our spirit.\r\nMorocco played an important part in the historic period\r\nfrom the twelfth century to the fifteenth century during\r\nwhich divine religions communicated as never before\r\nand science and the arts flourished in a way that was\r\nunprecedented in the Mediterranean region. The\r\nAndalusian legacy can be seen in the manuscripts and\r\narchitecture of Marrakesh and Fez, as well as of those\r\nof Seville, Cordoba and Granada.\r\nThe Arabs also served as a link to Western\r\ncivilization because they were able to preserve and\r\ndevelop the Greco-Roman tradition, enriching and\r\ntransforming it, as they transmitted it to Europe, where\r\nit contributed to the great Renaissance period.\r\nAll cultures are nourished by other cultures and\r\nby their environment. They profit and flourish from\r\nsuch contacts and from openness. We also know that,\r\nas is the case with individuals, when countries close\r\nthemselves off, it is as though they have died or\r\ndisappeared. It is essential for society to accept and\r\nprotect individual liberties, diversity of opinion and\r\nrespect for differences. Any dialogue must be\r\nsupported by an affirmation of tolerance, even if that\r\ncreates apparent — albeit controlled — disorder.\r\nIt is true that the existence of different political\r\nand social systems mean that freedom and democracy\r\nmay not be identical in every country. However, there\r\nis a core of fundamental human rights principles,\r\nmonitored by the international community, which\r\nprotect the physical integrity and dignity of individuals\r\nand which all countries must respect.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations is based on\r\nrespect for basic human rights. But it cannot develop\r\nunless it takes full account of both the relativity and\r\ndiversity of human perceptions, and abandons any\r\npretence, when determining cultural models, of\r\ninstituting a hierarchy of the perceptions, memories\r\nand sentiments that history has forged over the\r\ncenturies.\r\nIn trying to consolidate and protect their own\r\nculture, certain groups have created the idea of an\r\nexternal threat, attempting to replace the cold war with\r\nthe concept of a clash of civilizations. The process of\r\ndeveloping such a simplistic vision, which scorns\r\nhistory and anthropology, has already begun. But we\r\nnote that such a vision is defended today by only a very\r\nsmall groups of extremists.\r\nThere are others who would like to profit from\r\nextremist actions to pass judgement on a particular\r\nreligion or civilization. Such attempts are unacceptable,\r\nbecause they are intended to awaken the old\r\nchauvinisms and discords that we had hoped we would\r\nnever see again.\r\nWe must not forget that the universal values that\r\nunite us, and that are the foundation of the United\r\nNations, have also outlawed the idea of collective guilt,\r\ncollective responsibility and collective punishment. A\r\nsocial group as a whole may be swept up in\r\naberrations, but it is the individual that is criminally\r\nresponsible before the law.\r\nI gave the example of Andalusia, but I could also\r\nmention the extraordinary role sub-Saharan Africa\r\nplayed in the renewal of modern art in the last century.\r\nThat is why the accelerated pace of globalization in the\r\nlast 10 years must not in any way come to mean the\r\nuniformity or the uniformization of the world. It is up\r\nto the international community to ensure that the\r\nopening of trade and economic borders is carried out\r\nwith due respect for the cultural diversity present in the\r\nworld, which constitutes and embodies all the world’s\r\nwealth and beauty.\r\nThe dialogue of cultures therefore requires\r\nabandoning attitudes of hegemony, whether global or\r\nregional. The best measures of fecund dialogue among\r\ncivilizations are cooperation between States and the\r\npossibility, within States, for local cultures to express\r\nthemselves and to manage their own affairs. A people\r\nthat crushes another people cannot be considered free\r\nof all constraints; it inevitably places itself in a master-\r\nslave dialectic, a relationship that ultimately enslaves\r\nmaster as well as slave.\r\nIn this year, 2001, marked by the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember and the worsening of the situation in the\r\nMiddle East — the escalation of the despair and\r\ndistress of the Palestinians — we hope that the Year of\r\nthe Dialogue among Civilizations will lead to concrete\r\nmeasures not only to eliminate terrorism but also to\r\nrestore hope to Palestinian children crushed under the\r\nweight of violence, hardship and the daily denial of\r\ntheir culture.\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nMorocco is convinced that our Organization is the\r\nbody where dialogue can prosper and bear fruit in all\r\ndomains of human activity. Given that the dialogue\r\namong civilizations is a process for promoting\r\ninclusion, equity, justice, equality and tolerance\r\nbetween civilizations and within them, Morocco is\r\ndetermined to contribute, regionally and\r\ninternationally, to the strengthening of trust and\r\nreconciliation in order to build, through our collective\r\nwill, a new world in which all humanity can live in\r\nlove and harmony, inspired by peaceful principles\r\nbased on justice and equity and on the restitution to\r\nindividuals of their inherent rights, in conformity with\r\ninternational law, which is the best guarantor of the\r\npeace and stability of nations.\r\nMr. Mubarez (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express the pleasure of the\r\ndelegation of Yemen at the noticeable increase in\r\ninterest shown in the dialogue among civilizations.\r\nThis reflects a collective awareness of the lessons\r\nlearned from the last century, which was replete with\r\nwars and tensions. In the attempt to found international\r\nrelations on justice, faith and mutual respect through\r\ndialogue and democracy in word and in deed, General\r\nAssembly resolution 53/22, declaring this year the\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations,\r\nwas a necessary step in enabling us to benefit from\r\npositive trends after the cold war and from the\r\nmomentum of globalization and its mechanisms in\r\nenhancing international cooperation in the collective\r\nsearch for answers to the economic and social problems\r\nwe face at the start of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September have\r\nhighlighted the urgent need to intensify a dialogue and\r\nexchange of ideas in order not only to put an end to\r\nterrorism but also to eradicate all sources of conflict\r\nand tension in the world. There is no doubt that the\r\nevents of 11 September have made the eradication of\r\nterrorism a priority of collective efforts both within and\r\noutside the United Nations. Not only does terrorism in\r\nall its forms represent a danger to the security and\r\nstability of some countries but it also foments\r\nconfrontation and division among individuals and\r\npeoples and hinders development and progress. That is\r\nwhy it is important to intensify efforts for moving\r\nahead with the dialogue among civilizations. As the\r\nSecretary-General states in paragraph 19 of his report,\r\n“dialogue among civilizations is not only a\r\nnecessary answer to terrorism, it is in many ways\r\nits nemesis ... where terrorism is based on an\r\nexclusionary, belligerent view of the world, the\r\ndialogue seeks to promote inclusion and\r\nacceptance of the notion that the possession of\r\ntruth does not belong to any one group alone”.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the\r\nactivities carried out so far. It is clear from the report\r\nof the Secretary-General that these activities have gone\r\na long way in crystallizing basic principles for\r\ninternational cooperation and understanding through\r\nmutual respect and tolerance. Here, we would like to\r\nexpress our appreciation of the role of President\r\nKhatami, who drew attention to the importance of the\r\ndialogue among civilizations.\r\nThroughout its history, Yemen has been a point of\r\ngeographical, cultural and civilizational contacts\r\nbetween Asia and Africa and has always been a centre\r\nfor trade in summer and winter. Yemen has worked for\r\nopenness towards other cultures and civilizations\r\nthrough its media, special programmes and educational\r\ncurricula. It has also held various symposiums in\r\nresearch centres in the last two years towards the same\r\ngoal.\r\nHowever, these common concepts and\r\ncommunications — especially considering that the\r\nSecretary-General has stated that we should make use\r\nof traditional means and education — and the help\r\nrequired to form public opinion among people as\r\nindividuals, especially youth, call for a long-term\r\nstrategy. What is important in our view is to urge the\r\npeople working in the media to play a larger role\r\nbecause they are a great influence on public opinion\r\nand decision-making in foreign policy.\r\nRegrettably, some journalists were quick, in the\r\nimmediate aftermath of the terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember, to link international terrorism to Arabs and\r\nto Islam. This flies in the face of logic and only fuels\r\nthe distorted concept of a clash between cultures and\r\ncivilizations in the age of globalization and universal\r\ndemocracy. This makes it incumbent upon us to\r\nredouble our efforts to open new channels for dialogue\r\nand to encourage openness and respect for pluralism\r\nand ethnic and cultural diversity. Humanity has\r\nsuffered enough from intolerance and from ethnic and\r\nreligious differences and feelings of superiority.\r\nIn conclusion, we should promote this dialogue\r\namong civilizations by supporting the draft resolution\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nbefore us. My country has the great honour of being\r\namong the sponsors of that draft.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): It may be\r\nmore important today than ever before in the history of\r\nthis Organization to speak of humankind in terms of\r\ncivilizations, because today — as has been the case\r\nduring other dark periods of history — attempts are\r\nbeing made to justify violence as necessary for the\r\ndefence of culture, and horrendous crimes are being\r\ncommitted in the name of God.\r\nThat is what has led us today to take a look at our\r\nmany collective beliefs and memories and to proclaim\r\nthat diversity is our wealth — a wealth that consists\r\nalso of the values of tolerance, freedom and respect for\r\nuniversal human rights, all of which unite us.\r\nChile welcomes this dialogue, as well as the\r\nefforts of President Khatami and of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran to promote this initiative. Like others,\r\nwe are inspired by the hope that these meetings —\r\nwhich are becoming more frequent and are spreading to\r\nvarious continents — will help prevent millions of\r\npersons from losing touch with their humanity,\r\nforgetting that all culture is life and that there is but\r\none God, the creator of all life on this earth.\r\nWe see this as a different kind of debate — one\r\nthat is not devoted to the kinds of questions we usually\r\ndeal with, such as power and prestige among nations.\r\nThose concerns are dealt with in other forums within\r\nthis Organization. But we attach great importance to\r\nthe fact that the United Nations is undertaking this type\r\nof reflection. As stated by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport, which we welcome, we consider the United\r\nNations to be\r\n“the natural home of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations; the forum where such dialogue can\r\nflourish and bear fruit in every field of human\r\nendeavour”. (A/56/523, para. 15)\r\nThat is why we would like to share here what we\r\nconsider to be the basic truths we live by. We want to\r\ntake a critical look at our cultures and to reconsider the\r\nvalue of that which is ours, and of that which is not.\r\nWe want to live in a way that allows us to admire the\r\nhumanity of those who are foreign to us.\r\nWe would therefore like to reiterate that we value\r\ntolerance as the greatest wealth of humanity, the very\r\nessence of our human nature, and the quality that\r\nenables us to acknowledge the value of the specific\r\ncharacteristics and ineffable nature of all cultures.\r\nWe Latin Americans, who are descended from\r\nthat extraordinary mix of the inhabitants of the Iberian\r\npeninsula — Goths, Arabs, Lusitanians, Catalans,\r\nBasques and Jews — blended with the indigenous races\r\nof our American land, cannot ignore the value of\r\nplurality or the pain of intolerance, in view of how\r\ndeeply these phenomena have affected our history.\r\nToday, in considering the dizzying speed of\r\nprogress of globalization and the way in which —\r\nthanks to the incredible advances made possible by the\r\ntechnological revolution — it has brought together men\r\nand women from previously remote cultures and lands,\r\nwe have to acknowledge that nothing of this magnitude\r\nhas happened to humanity since the discovery of\r\nAmerica and the immense and painful meeting of races\r\nand cultures that resulted.\r\nJust as in 1550 — when Emperor Charles V\r\nconvened a meeting that gave rise to the Valladolid\r\ncontroversy — we are continuing to deal with the\r\ndiscrepancy between the views of those who see the\r\nworld as Ginés de Sepulveda did at the time — based\r\non the principle of inequality, with ranks, levels and\r\nhierarchies — and the views of those of us who see it\r\nas Bartolomé de las Casas did. He protected the Indians\r\nof the Americas, saying that nowhere on earth are there\r\nhuman beings who may be called non-humans or who\r\nmust be dominated for their own good.\r\nIndeed, it was Bartolomé de las Casas who saw\r\nthat an unprecedented relationship had been established\r\nbetween the truth of unity and the diversity of human\r\nbeings. He said that diversity was not a mistake, but\r\nthat, on the contrary, the multiplicity of religions and\r\nforms of cultural expression was a reflection of the\r\nuniversality of religion and the fundamental identity of\r\nthe human race.\r\nThat is why those of us who are joining in the\r\nglobalization process must have an open mind, like\r\nBartolomé de las Casas did. We are aware of the\r\nbenefits and risks of joining this vast network of\r\ncommunications, products and technologies, and trade\r\nand transnational financial flows. But we know that\r\nthere is no alternative, because autarchy is neither\r\npossible nor better.\r\nBut in doing this, we must not become obsessed\r\nwith the idea of imposing a single truth based on\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nscience. Our fascination with technology must not lead\r\nus to trivialize our self-image or to deepen the spiritual\r\nimpoverishment of human beings today. We cannot\r\nforget that, if human beings neglect the spiritual\r\ndimension, this rapid integration will become a\r\nreckless, headlong rush towards the systematic\r\ndestruction of our roots — an experiment in\r\nderacination.\r\nAs Pope John Paul II said of this dialogue, it is a\r\npath that is\r\n“inspired by an approach to life marked by\r\nsecularism, practical atheism and by patterns of\r\nradical individualism … sustained by powerful\r\nmedia campaigns and designed to propagate\r\nlifestyles, social and economic programmes and,\r\nin the last analysis, a comprehensive world view\r\nwhich erodes from within other estimable\r\ncultures and civilizations”.\r\nLet us state it clearly: all too often our Western\r\ncivilization, with all of its magnificence and wealth,\r\nhas looked at the world around it as if it were\r\ntransparent. It looks, but it does not see. It creates\r\ncategories and believes them to be universal, and\r\nabides by them as if they had been divinely ordained,\r\nonly to realize — when catastrophe strikes — that they\r\nare replete with uncertainty and precariousness.\r\nThat is why the dialogue we are promoting today\r\nmust be seen, above all, as an exercise in humility.\r\nThe modern western trinity of freedom, equality\r\nand fraternity lost its last component a long time ago.\r\nWe must rediscover that notion of fraternity in this\r\ndialogue among civilizations. We are called to it by\r\narticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nwhen it asks us to act towards one another in a spirit of\r\nbrotherhood.\r\nWe are Members of the United Nations because\r\nwe cannot tolerate the idea that the advance of\r\nmodernity will have as a fatal outcome the construction\r\nof a planet of trenches and fortresses, in which a\r\nmechanized world of globalized elites protects itself\r\nfrom a world of the marginalized armed only with their\r\nbeliefs. Our dialogue must therefore help create\r\nfoundations of principles intended to avoid the self-\r\nfulfilling prophecies of a neo-Malthusian science that\r\noffers the impossible-to-imitate unattainable growth\r\nand spending models for one half of humanity, or\r\ndecrees that owing to geographic location, level of\r\nwealth, culture and education or the lack thereof, half\r\nof the planet is hopelessly destined to be excluded from\r\nprogress.\r\nHowever, today, above all, we must confront\r\nhatred. Our dialogue on what makes us diverse is based\r\non the reaffirmation so often repeated in this Hall that\r\nall human rights are universal, indivisible,\r\ninterdependent and interrelated, and that it is the duty\r\nof States, whatever their cultural, economic or political\r\nsystems, to promote and protect all human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. Nothing can make this\r\ncommitment more difficult than the growth of a spiral\r\nof hatred transmitted over generations, taught to our\r\nchildren and accepted as absolute truth in infantile\r\nminds.\r\nFor this reason, and so that dialogue might\r\nadvance in small but significant steps, we modestly\r\nsuggest that all of us who have supported the value of\r\nthese meetings agree progressively to eliminate from\r\nthe texts our children study — be they about religion or\r\nhistory — all those concepts that portray the other as\r\nan enemy and that reduce the human dignity of those\r\nwho are different, practice a different faith or are of a\r\ndifferent nationality.\r\nNothing can be more important than to promote\r\nthis path in the field of religious instruction. As was\r\nsaid a few weeks ago by Václav Havel, speaking in\r\nSt. Vitus Cathedral in Prague to the representatives of\r\nthe world’s religions, it seems the time has come to\r\ncreate a great spiritual coalition that will widen\r\ncooperation among the religions of the world, and their\r\njoint efforts, in order to confront the forces of\r\ndestruction in the name of respect for life and human\r\ndignity. In so doing, we would fulfil what the God of\r\nthe Bible commanded when he declared to his people\r\nand through them to all mankind that they and\r\nforeigners were equal before God.\r\nChile is ready to promote within and beyond its\r\nregion meetings of thinkers and intellectuals, religious\r\nand political leaders, that will spread tolerance and\r\nrespect for all. It is our fervent wish that this year will\r\nnot only mark the high point of pain and anger but will\r\nalso be recalled in the future as the moment when we\r\nbegan a global reflection on the course of civilizations.\r\nMs. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to thank the Islamic Republic of Iran for\r\ninitiating this discussion at the General Assembly.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nIn its resolution 53/22 the General Assembly\r\nproclaimed the year 2001 as the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, thereby recognizing\r\nmankind’s diverse achievements in civilization.\r\nCrystallizing cultural pluralism and creative human\r\ndiversity, it emphasized the significant role of dialogue\r\nas a means to reach understanding, remove threats to\r\npeace and strengthen interaction and exchange among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nGlobalization, which is shaping the contours of\r\nthe new world order, has promoted mutual enrichment\r\nof civilizations and created new opportunities for\r\ncultural exchange. Modern technology, having\r\nintensified rapidly over the past decade, has brought\r\nmany parts of the world into closer contact.\r\nIn the rapidly developing world, we are\r\nconfronted with challenges that represent a serious\r\nthreat to the world’s creative diversity: ethnic conflicts\r\nand xenophobia, racism and discrimination, prejudice\r\nand intolerance. It should be noted that many of the\r\nproblems we are facing today have arisen as a\r\nconsequence of differences within nations. We must\r\nlearn to respect each nation with its cultural heritage,\r\ncustoms and traditions, and dispel hatred, ignorance\r\nand distrust.\r\nThe year 2001 is particularly important for the\r\npeople of Kazakhstan. We are celebrating the tenth\r\nanniversary of our independence. The past 10 years has\r\nbeen a period of our State’s consolidation and\r\ntransformation into a democratic society. We\r\nproclaimed the creation of a humane society with equal\r\nrights for all the peoples and nationalities of\r\nKazakhstan.\r\nMy delegation shares the view of the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization Director-General, Mr. Koichiro Matsuura,\r\nthat dialogue must begin at home. My country has a\r\nunique history, rich traditions and diverse cultures.\r\nKazakhstan is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious\r\nsociety. With a potentially explosive mix of 130\r\nnationalities, we have learned to live together in peace,\r\nwithout domestic turmoil or conflict.\r\nThe President and the Government of Kazakhstan\r\nencourage intercultural dialogue in every possible way.\r\nThe recommendations of the Assembly of the Peoples\r\nof Kazakhstan, a broad non-governmental body\r\nrepresenting all the minorities of Kazakhstan, are taken\r\ninto account at the decision-making level. This body\r\nwas established by decree of the President 10 years ago\r\nto prevent inter-ethnic conflicts and promote dialogue\r\nbetween all the peoples and nationalities of\r\nKazakhstan. We safeguard freedom of religious\r\nworship for all people — Muslims, Russian Orthodox,\r\nProtestants and Catholics. A visit by the Pope to my\r\ncountry last September was an important event for all\r\ncultures in Kazakhstan. That visit, serving as a vivid\r\nexample of a balanced approach to all religions,\r\npromoted intercultural dialogue and signified\r\nunderstanding, tolerance and mutual respect.\r\nIn today’s strife-torn world, the domestic stability\r\nand tolerance we have built stand as our greatest\r\nachievement. We shall continue to do everything\r\npossible to preserve such values as inter-ethnic\r\nharmony and the multiplicity of cultures and customs\r\nof the various ethnic groups that constitute the people\r\nof Kazakhstan.\r\nDialogue among civilizations is an important tool\r\nfor differing cultures to find their places in a\r\ncomplicated world. Each culture should cultivate\r\nwithin itself values of respect for other cultures. This is\r\nextremely important in light of recent events. On\r\nseveral occasions, my delegation has emphasized that\r\nwe must not condemn all Muslims and Arabs for the\r\nterrorist attacks. The vast majority of people do not\r\nsupport religious extremism. We must oppose those\r\nwho blame the religion of Islam, which is used by\r\ncriminal elements to justify terrorist acts that take the\r\nlives of innocent people. Islam is a religion of peace\r\nthat calls for coexistence, tolerance and respect among\r\npeople and prohibits the killing of the innocent. As the\r\nSecretary-General has rightfully emphasized, no\r\nreligion, people or region should be targeted because of\r\nthe acts of individuals.\r\nThe United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations has great potential to help prevent conflict\r\non the international, national and local levels by\r\nreducing misunderstanding and mistrust and by laying\r\nthe foundation for the non-violent resolution of\r\ncontroversies. The dialogue of civilizations presents an\r\nexcellent opportunity to the international community to\r\nmake joint efforts in consolidating pluralism and\r\ndemocracy and in struggling against terrorism,\r\nviolence, intolerance and other dangerous phenomena\r\nthat threaten all civilizations. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations will play an important role in this\r\nprocess. Let me reiterate that my country is ready to\r\ncontribute to this endeavour.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): In his address to the students of the Moscow\r\nState Institute of International Relations, the President\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mr. Mohammad\r\nKhatami, recalled the saying that Alexander Pushkin is\r\nthe soul of the Russian people. We will always love\r\nPushkin in Russia. We will love him for praising\r\nfreedom and calling for mercy for the fallen in difficult\r\ntimes. Those words comprise the essence of Russian\r\nspiritual culture. Freedom, mercy and compassion are\r\nthe essence of all great civilizations. Should one\r\nremove them, civilization would simply turn into\r\nbarbarism.\r\nOn 31 May 2001, within the framework of its\r\nagenda item entitled “United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations”, the General Assembly adopted a\r\nresolution in which it unanimously condemned the\r\ndestruction of religious sites. The community of\r\nnations thereby denied such vandalism the right to call\r\nitself part of civilization. In September of this year,\r\nvandals were already destroying not just religious\r\nmonuments and historic statues, but human lives and\r\ndestinies. Vandalism has revealed itself to the world in\r\nthe twenty-first century in the form of intolerance,\r\nextremism and terrorism. As was emphasized by the\r\nPresident of Russia, Mr. Vladimir Putin:\r\n“Terrorists set for themselves one goal, and one\r\ngoal only: to destroy the foundation and values of\r\nmodern civilization. At the same time, they are\r\nnot accustomed to respecting any kind of laws or\r\nmorals, and in the most impudent and violent way\r\ndestroy those standards.”\r\nTerrorists often appeal to history, religion and\r\nother lofty subjects to justify their violence. But, as\r\nwas noted by the Personal Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, Mr. Giandomenico\r\nPicco, “History does not kill. Religion does not rape\r\nwomen, the purity of blood does not destroy\r\nbuildings”. That is done by those who reject history,\r\nwho pervert religion and who seek to pit nations and\r\ncultures against each other. We must reply to that with\r\nmoral courage.\r\nThe Tehran Declaration, which was adopted at the\r\nIslamic Symposium on Dialogue among Civilizations,\r\nheld from 3 to 5 May 1999, speaks of the need to be\r\nguided by the notions of “human dignity and equality,\r\ntolerance, peace and justice for humankind, and\r\npromotion of virtues and proscription of vice and evil”\r\n(A/54/116, annex). For the sake of these principles, the\r\nleaders of Russian Muslims launched an initiative to\r\nconvene in Moscow an international conference\r\nentitled “Islam against Terrorism”.\r\nRussia has a unique experience regarding the\r\ncoexistence of great cultures and religions. Their\r\ninteraction and mutual enrichment is the basis of our\r\nnational being. East and West, Europe and Asia, have\r\ncome together on a vast space between the Atlantic and\r\nthe Pacific Oceans. That is why we are very much in\r\naccord with the principles of dialogue and tolerance,\r\nwhich must take precedence not only at the junction of\r\ncivilizations, but also within them.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s words ring true:\r\n“Without this dialogue taking place every day\r\namong all nations — within and between\r\ncivilizations, cultures and groups ─ no peace can\r\nbe lasting and no prosperity can be secure.”\r\n(A/56/523, para. 15)\r\nWe also agree that to speak of a Christian,\r\nMuslim or Buddhist civilization means only to create\r\nboundaries where none need exist. Our country has\r\nlately been paying particular attention to the\r\nestablishment of a tolerant mindset within society. We\r\nhave recently completed a large-scale project, “Culture\r\nof Peace in Russia — Year 2000”. In August of this\r\nyear, the Government of the Russian Federation\r\nadopted a federal programme entitled “The Formation\r\nof the Basis for a Tolerant Mindset and the Prevention\r\nof Extremism in Russian Society”. Practically all the\r\nregions of Russia have contributed to the celebration of\r\nthe Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. It is\r\nheartening to note that the Group of Eminent Persons\r\nestablished by the Secretary-General includes our\r\ncountryman, Professor Sergey Kapitza.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on the Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations notes the special role\r\nplayed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO), particularly in\r\nimplementing the Year. It is remarkable that several\r\ndays ago, on 2 November, the thirty-first General\r\nConference of UNESCO adopted the Universal\r\nDeclaration on Cultural Diversity. It is important to\r\nnote that the provisions of this Declaration, which were\r\ndrafted with the active involvement of my country, are\r\naimed at ensuring respect for cultural diversity,\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\ntolerance and dialogue as necessary prerequisites for\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe notion of a Russian world has always gone\r\nfar beyond geographical boundaries, and even the\r\nboundaries of the Russian ethos. The Russian-speaking\r\ncommunity today is the fifth largest in the world. Tens\r\nof millions of people who speak, think and — what is\r\nperhaps even more important — feel in Russian now\r\nlive in countries other than the Russian Federation. Our\r\nprincipal task is to preserve the national culture, help\r\nour compatriots to defend their human rights and to\r\nprotect them from discrimination. That was the focus\r\nof the Congress of Compatriots held recently in\r\nMoscow. The achievement of that goal is in harmony\r\nwith the philosophy of dialogue among civilizations,\r\nnamely, the promotion of tolerance and respect for\r\ndiversity.\r\nThe concept “United Nations” implies united\r\ncivilizations as well. We differ in geographical\r\nlatitudes, time zones, languages, historical experiences\r\nand cultural traditions. But the peoples of the United\r\nNations have a common aspiration: to save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith\r\nin fundamental human rights and to promote social\r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\r\nIn the face of new challengers and threats, it is\r\nnecessary to strengthen the role of the United Nations\r\nas an indispensable instrument for intensifying\r\ndialogue everywhere in order to maintain international\r\npeace and security and to establish a non-violent,\r\ndemocratic world order. A guarantee of success in this\r\nrespect is the equality of all Member States with regard\r\nto the Charter and other basic principles and standards\r\nof international law.\r\nThe task of promoting an equitable dialogue\r\namong civilizations becomes even more urgent in the\r\ncontext of globalization. Globalization should not\r\nimply uniformity and adjustment to certain standards\r\nand patterns. We need diversity. In his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, the Secretary-General called\r\nfor making globalization inclusive and equitable. An\r\nequitable process requires in particular the eradication\r\nof poverty. President Putin has stated that, without\r\nsolving the problem of poverty, it will not be possible\r\nto solve the problem of tension in the world. We have a\r\nsaying in Russia according to which a well-fed man\r\nfinds it difficult to understand a starving one. For the\r\nsake of dialogue, understanding and stability on a\r\nglobal scale, it is necessary to rid the world of hunger,\r\ndisease, discrimination and hostilities. The eradication\r\nof these evils is essential to uniting peoples,\r\ncivilizations, religions and cultures.\r\nRussia was among the first at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to join in sponsoring the draft\r\nresolution entitled “Global agenda for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations”. That agenda outlines the human\r\ndimension of the activities of the community of\r\nnations: mutual tolerance instead of hostility,\r\ncooperation instead of alienation and pluralism instead\r\nof ruling by diktat — these are the starting points for\r\nthe United Nations as it enters a new era.\r\nIt is notable that the Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations has coincided with the first year of the\r\nnew century. We now have an obligation to strengthen\r\nand develop this dialogue in every possible way.\r\nOtherwise, should it be interrupted, we will inherit\r\nwhat was foreseen — once again, by Pushkin — as “a\r\nterrible age and terrible hearts”.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): At the outset, I\r\nwish to join the preceding speakers in expressing our\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the report on\r\nthis item. I would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the delegation of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran for this important and timely\r\ninitiative.\r\nIndeed, it is timely that the General Assembly is\r\nconsidering this item today when the world is still in a\r\nstate of shock from the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember, which represented the worst of humanity,\r\nwhile the dialogue seeks to enable and promote the best\r\nof humanity. My delegation fully agrees with the\r\nSecretary-General, who stated in his report, that\r\n“A dialogue among civilizations is not only a\r\nnecessary answer to terrorism — it is in many\r\nways its nemesis. Where terrorism seeks to divide\r\nhumanity, the dialogue aims to unite us; where\r\nterrorism is based on an exclusionary, belligerent\r\nview of the world, the dialogue seeks to promote\r\ninclusion and acceptance of the notion that the\r\npossession of truth does not belong to any one\r\ngroup alone. Where terrorism seeks to make our\r\ndiversity the source of conflict, the dialogue can\r\nhelp make the same diversity the foundation for\r\nbetterment and growth.” (A/56/523, para. 19)\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nThe importance of our deliberations here today\r\nlies not only in the fact that the subject matter is an\r\nextremely important one, but also in the fact that its\r\nconsideration in this body represents in itself a form of\r\ndialogue among different civilizations. These\r\ndeliberations will show us that dialogue and the\r\nexchange of ideas can make a valuable contribution to\r\nan improved awareness and better understanding of our\r\ncommon heritage and shared values. The dialogue also\r\nreflects the determined will of Member States to come\r\nup with a new common approach based on our common\r\nunderstanding. Therefore, the international community\r\nshould continue to work towards promoting a norm of\r\ninteraction and relations between nations based on\r\ndialogue, cooperation and mutual respect. This\r\ndialogue is essential if we agree that we wish to be\r\nsuccessful in achieving one of the main objectives of\r\nthe United Nations: the prevention of future conflicts.\r\nIn November 1998 the General Assembly adopted\r\nresolution 53/22, by which it proclaimed the current\r\nyear as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. It is gratifying to note that the idea of a\r\ndialogue among civilizations has been well received\r\nand has stimulated wide participation across the world.\r\nAs is indicated in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\ngovernmental and academic institutions, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and international\r\norganizations have been actively involved in the Year’s\r\nactivities and have conducted a series of important\r\nconferences, seminars and research works on this issue,\r\nbringing together a variety of civil society groups. We\r\nnote with appreciation that the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) has been particularly instrumental in\r\nfostering the interest of Member States during this Year\r\nand that the dialogue among civilizations has been\r\nselected as its strategic objective in its Medium-Term\r\nStrategy for 2002-2007.\r\nWe have learned with great interest that the result\r\nof collective work prepared by the Personal\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the Year,\r\ntogether with the Director-General of UNESCO and the\r\nGroup of Eminent Persons, entitled Crossing the\r\nDivide: Dialogue among Civilizations, was submitted\r\nrecently to the Secretary-General. It is our earnest hope\r\nthat this book will be available soon to all Member\r\nStates, as we expect that it will contribute substantially\r\nto our renewed efforts at all levels to encourage and\r\nfoster dialogue among different civilizations in the\r\nyears to come.\r\nAs in many countries, a series of events and\r\nactivities has been launched in Mongolia to observe\r\nand support the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations. Among them I wish to single out\r\nthe importance of the International Symposium on\r\nDialogue among Civilizations: Interaction between\r\nNomadic and Other Cultures of Central Asia, which\r\nwas organized by the International Institute for the\r\nStudy of Nomadic Civilizations, based in Mongolia.\r\nThe Symposium was held in Ulaanbaatar last August.\r\nIt was attended by over 120 scholars from different\r\ncountries. It shed light on both historical and\r\ncontemporary interaction between cultures and\r\ncivilizations. As the Director of UNESCO’s Division of\r\nIntercultural Dialogue pointed out in his message to the\r\nparticipants of the Symposium, “It is in this manner,\r\nthrough the discovery of a common heritage and shared\r\nvalues, that a positive convergence between cultures\r\ncan be favoured”.\r\nWe live in a world that is both unique and\r\ndiverse. In this world, active and mutually enriching\r\ndialogues and exchanges between civilizations are of\r\ngreat importance, not only in exploring each other’s\r\nrich legacies, but also in forecasting the future. Over\r\nthe past years, my country, Mongolia, considered today\r\nto be the locus classicus of nomadic civilization, is\r\nmaking every effort to further deepen studies on\r\nvarious aspects of nomadic civilization and its\r\ninfluence and interaction among others. Thus, the\r\nability of nomads to adapt to nature and live in full\r\nharmony with it, pastoral nomadism, their different\r\ntechniques and ways of protecting and using land in a\r\nsustained manner could be of particular interest and use\r\nin developing further action to protect and preserve our\r\ncommon nature and the environment.\r\nWe are living in an age known as “accelerating\r\nglobalization”. Therefore, this should be one of the\r\nmain topics of the ongoing dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and cultures. While globalization\r\nincreasingly affects all spheres of contemporary life,\r\nfurther efforts should be made to ensure more equal\r\ndistribution of its benefits among different countries, as\r\nwell as among various groups within societies.\r\nFurthermore, as the Secretary-General stated in his\r\nreport,\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\n“It is also critical that globalization not reflect the\r\ntriumph or victory of one ideology or culture or\r\neconomic system over another. Indeed, it is\r\nimportant that cultural diversity be preserved in\r\nthe dynamic interaction among cultures in the\r\nprocess of globalization.” (A/56/523, para. 16)\r\nGlobalization and increasing interdependence\r\namong nations compel us to search for and mold a new\r\nvision of international relations that is based on the\r\nspirit of peace, mutual respect, dialogue and\r\ncooperation.\r\nWith this in mind, my delegation joined the\r\nsponsorship of the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/56/L.3, submitted under this agenda item,\r\nwhich proclaims a global agenda for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. We are confident that its unanimous\r\nadoption by the General Assembly at this session will\r\nfurther enhance mutual understanding and solidarity\r\namong nations, and thus it will become yet another\r\noccasion for Member States to underline their unity in\r\nthe fight against intolerance, prejudice and violence.\r\nMr. Datsenko (Ukraine): The current year,\r\nproclaimed by the General Assembly as the Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations and marked by horrible\r\nacts of terrorism, has taken on much symbolic\r\nimportance, bringing the peoples and nations of the\r\nworld to a better understanding of the urgent need for\r\nconcerted international efforts at strengthening peace\r\nand security on our planet — the prerequisites for\r\nachieving sustainable development on a global scale. It\r\nis on the basis of such an understanding that dialogue\r\nbetween various civilizations is to be galvanized and\r\nturned into a systematic process of coordinating and\r\nconsolidating the activities of peace-loving forces\r\naround the world.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have clearly\r\nshown how fragile and vulnerable our present-day\r\nworld is. In these new circumstances, the international\r\ncommunity has to demonstrate its ability to adapt,\r\nurgently and efficiently, to the new problems and\r\nrealities of the changing world. It will be especially\r\nimportant to take a balanced approach to solving the\r\ninternational problems and challenges that have arisen\r\nin the new millennium. Such an approach should be\r\nbased on the necessity to solve existing global\r\nproblems effectively and to guarantee the preservation\r\nand free development of the historical traditions of\r\nevery nation. In this way, it will be possible to ensure\r\npeaceful and harmonious coexistence and jointly\r\nadvance the development of different nations and\r\ncultures of the world.\r\nThat is why, today, more than ever before, the\r\nDialogue among Civilizations has to be not only an\r\nimportant form of general communication, but also a\r\nglobal motivating force and way of life, promoting\r\ncommon understanding and seeking mutually\r\nacceptable decisions for the sake of greater sustainable\r\ndevelopment for humankind. It will enable the\r\ninternational community to cope with the global\r\nproblems of underdevelopment, poverty and disease,\r\nand also such ugly phenomena as xenophobia, racism,\r\nextremism and terrorism.\r\nIn our view, the Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nshould favour a deeper analysis and understanding of\r\nglobal processes. This would enable us to work out\r\neffective mechanisms of cooperation among nations\r\nand facilitate the formation of a new world order and a\r\nnew type of human civilization, promoting a culture of\r\ntolerance and respect for diversity of religions, cultures\r\nand traditions.\r\nThe diversity of cultures and traditions is of\r\nspecial value to humanity. It is a source of strength and\r\na catalyst for the social development of the\r\ninternational community. The principles of respect for\r\nothers, tolerance and constructive and mutually\r\nbeneficial cooperation among civilizations should form\r\nthe basis of international relations, since, essentially,\r\nwe are guided by the common goals and values laid out\r\nin the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe need for dialogue is especially pressing in the\r\ncontext of the ongoing and rapidly developing\r\nglobalization process, which has to be used for\r\nadvancing the economic, spiritual and cultural\r\ndevelopment of all countries of the world.\r\nA decisive role in the development of the global\r\ndialogue is to be played by international mechanisms\r\nand, above all, the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, especially the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),\r\nconsidering its specific competencies in the area of\r\neducation and culture.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations has every\r\nmeans at its disposal to unite the efforts of the\r\ninternational community in order to stimulate and\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.40\r\nconsolidate the world movement for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations to meet modern challenges.\r\nOther international bodies and regional\r\norganizations, as well as national associations, political\r\nparties, public and religious organizations, parliaments,\r\nGovernments, political and public figures, scientists,\r\nintellectuals and youth organizations should also be\r\nactively involved in this movement.\r\nIt will facilitate the formation of a global climate\r\nof mutual trust and tolerance, the abandonment of\r\noutmoded stereotypes and the promotion of essentially\r\nnew models of coexistence based on common human\r\nethical values and principles. It will encourage foreign-\r\npolicy makers to reject outdated conceptions and\r\nideological models. As a result, it will strengthen\r\nglobal stability, peace and security, as well as help to\r\nbuild a world without divisions.\r\nToday the notion of international stability and\r\nsecurity goes far beyond the limits of the military\r\nsphere. To a large degree, it is influenced by a variety\r\nof economic, political, educational, scientific, technical\r\nand cultural factors. Therefore, it demands new\r\napproaches to the definition of global stability and\r\nsecurity, taking into consideration all these factors.\r\nThe experience of the last decades has\r\nconvincingly proved that true dialogue is impossible\r\nwithout taking into account the cultural and religious\r\ntraditions of each society. At the same time, the\r\nDialogue among Civilizations is today impossible\r\nwithout a dialogue within civilizations, individual\r\nStates and social groups.\r\nSince gaining its independence in 1991, Ukraine\r\nhas successfully met the difficult challenge of\r\nestablishing the peaceful and harmonious coexistence\r\nof numerous national minorities within a single unitary\r\nState. The Government of Ukraine has succeeded in\r\nrepatriating previously deported peoples, in particular\r\nCrimean Tatars, more than 250,000 of whom have\r\nreturned to Ukraine since its independence. We have\r\nalways believed that the restoration of historical justice\r\ncould bring about important social changes, which\r\nwould help to overcome racial, religious, cultural and\r\nother kinds of inter-ethnic tensions.\r\nThe emphasis has also been made on active\r\ninterfaith dialogue, which in our view is an important\r\npart of the dialogue among civilizations. There are\r\nmore than 100 different religious groups in Ukraine.\r\nThe dialogue between them is held within the\r\nframework of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches\r\nand Religious Organizations with the purpose of\r\nsolving the existing and emerging problems by the\r\njoint efforts of the State and religious associations.\r\nIn this interfaith dialogue, we also rely on\r\ncontributions from international religious organizations\r\nand their leaders. The visit of the Head of the Holy\r\nSee, Pope John Paul II, to Ukraine last June was a\r\nvivid example of this.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that Ukraine\r\nhas been an enthusiastic supporter of the General\r\nAssembly resolution “Global agenda for Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations”, whose idea is to advance an\r\nintegrated and system-wide treatment of this subject\r\nand to bring about concrete proposals for action, in\r\nparticular by Governments and intergovernmental\r\nbodies. And we are hopeful that the forthcoming\r\ngeneral debate will give additional impetus to future\r\ncoordinated efforts of the international community to\r\nmake the Dialogue an effective instrument for solving\r\nthe existing and new challenges facing humankind.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
