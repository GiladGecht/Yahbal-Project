(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 25 (continued)\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/523)\r\nDraft resolution (A/56/L.3)\r\nMr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): Allow\r\nme to begin by expressing my delegation’s appreciation\r\nto the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for\r\npreparing the draft resolution entitled “Global agenda\r\nfor dialogue among civilizations” (A/56/L.3). I would\r\nalso like to thank the Secretary-General for preparing a\r\nsuccinct yet informative report, and his Personal\r\nRepresentative for the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, Mr. Giandomenico Picco, for his\r\ntireless efforts to promote the spirit of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. In particular, we commend him for\r\nlaunching yesterday the book entitled Crossing the\r\nDivide: Dialogue among Civilizations, the fruits of a\r\ntwo-year collaborative effort undertaken by 18\r\nmembers of the Group of Eminent Persons.\r\nLast year we ushered in the new century with\r\ngreat confidence and high expectations for the years to\r\ncome. This optimism derived from the anticipation\r\nthat, with the end of the cold war, barriers among\r\nnations would erode and economic prosperity would\r\nspread around the globe, aided by the information\r\ntechnology revolution and the onset of globalization.\r\nThe reality, however, is that the benefits of\r\nglobalization and the information revolution have been\r\nunevenly distributed throughout the world. In addition,\r\nthanks to rapid advances in telecommunications\r\ntechnology, different civilizations now interface more\r\nfrequently than ever before, but this generally occurs in\r\nan asymmetrical manner. Such developments have\r\ninevitably produced side-effects, which may shed more\r\nlight on the economic disparities and diverse\r\nperspectives that exist among various regions\r\nbelonging to different civilizations.\r\nRather than allow the information technology\r\nrevolution and globalization to drive a wedge between\r\ncivilizations, the international community should take\r\nadvantage of their potential to enhance contact among\r\ndiverse groups. To do so, we should devise a normative\r\nframework that would foster the spirit of tolerance and\r\nunderstanding through expanded contact among\r\npeople.\r\nIn this context, the Government of the Republic\r\nof Korea appreciates all the initiatives taken by the\r\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran since\r\n1998. We believe it would be a very welcome and\r\nfitting step to adopt the draft resolution on the Global\r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations during the\r\nvery year the United Nations has designated for such\r\ndialogue.\r\nLooking back upon a succession of recent\r\nconflicts, it becomes evident that many conflicts can be\r\nattributed to a lack of communication and consequent\r\nmisunderstandings between different groups, be they\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nnational, ethnic or religious. However, we need to\r\nbeware of those who exploit such differences and\r\ndiversity for political purposes, particularly those who\r\nespouse hatred under the guise of safeguarding\r\ncivilization. Those are the people who draw fault lines\r\nbetween civilizations. To prevent such fault lines from\r\nbecoming more deeply inscribed, dialogue among\r\ncivilizations should be more vigorously encouraged in\r\nthe future.\r\nIn conducting such dialogues, no one can deny\r\nthat a spirit of tolerance and an acceptance of diversity\r\nare essential. Unless guided by the spirit of tolerance,\r\nincreased contact among people in the era of\r\nglobalization might arouse fear of those who are\r\ndifferent. If left unchecked, such fear can turn into\r\nhatred. In this regard, dialogue among civilizations has\r\nbecome all the more important in the wake of the\r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September.\r\nAs indicated in the preambular part of the Global\r\nAgenda, we should not lose sight of the fact that\r\ninteraction among civilizations has enriched humanity\r\nthroughout history. In fact, rich diversity among the\r\nworld’s civilizations can and should be an asset and a\r\nstimulus to mutual development, rather than a source of\r\nconflict.\r\nAlthough an acceptance of diversity and a spirit\r\nof tolerance are essential ingredients in any dialogue\r\namong civilizations, we cannot deny the existence of\r\ncertain universal values. These universal values are the\r\nembodiment of the collective wisdom, insights and\r\nexperiences emanating from different civilizations over\r\nthe course of humankind’s long history. In some sense,\r\nthey provide fertile soil in which diverse seeds from\r\ndifferent civilizations can together be planted and\r\nencouraged to flourish. At the same time, my\r\ndelegation would like to stress that dialogue does not\r\nmean appeasement of the arrogance of power or of the\r\nblind courage of ignorance. Rather, dialogue should be\r\nbased on the fundamental principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIn this context, my delegation believes that the\r\nUnited Nations serves as a unique forum where a broad\r\narray of civilizations, represented by Member States,\r\ncan pursue dialogue, accepting diversity as well as\r\nuniversal values. We appreciate the efforts that the\r\nUnited Nations system, including the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO), has made so far to foster dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. Furthermore, we believe that long-term\r\nprojects promoting dialogue and tolerance in the fields\r\nof education and culture should be further encouraged\r\nthroughout the United Nations system. While we\r\nrecognize that the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations will come to an end in less than\r\ntwo months, we hope that the momentum gained\r\nthroughout the Year will be sustained and revitalized in\r\nthe years to come.\r\nHaving consecutively inherited Buddhist and\r\nConfucian civilizations in the past, and more recently\r\nelements of a Christian culture, the Korean people\r\nconsider themselves well equipped to engage in a\r\ndialogue among civilizations on the basis of their\r\nenriched cultural and spiritual heritage. Indeed, the\r\nKorean Government held a successful seminar on\r\ndialogue among civilizations in Seoul last year, in\r\ncooperation with UNESCO.\r\nThe Republic of Korea looks forward to making\r\nmore constructive contributions to the cause of\r\ndialogue among civilizations in the years to come.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): The Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations considers dialogue to be a means of\r\nharmonizing international relations and resolving\r\ndifferences among States. It places dialogue at the\r\nhighest peak of human endeavours, for the promotion\r\nof peace and the solution of international problems.\r\nThe item under consideration aims at these lofty goals,\r\nas well as at strengthening the bonds within and among\r\ncivilizations, emphasizing the common destiny of\r\nhumankind. Promoting cooperation, interchange,\r\ntolerance and understanding among peoples, and\r\ncoexistence among countries, cultures and religions, is\r\nnot only a good policy; it is also an imperative choice\r\nfor survival.\r\nOur societies and our cultures are not, and cannot\r\nbe, isolated entities. A local crisis in a place far\r\nremoved from our borders or shores unfailingly and\r\nimmediately affects us all. We are part, it seems, of the\r\nsame global village, where our actions or omissions,\r\nour deeds or misdeeds, are affecting everyday life\r\neverywhere. And here lies the contradiction of our\r\npresent day: instead of drawing closer to each other in\r\nthis interdependent world, we continue to experience\r\nmuch conflict and human misery from segregation,\r\nseparation and divisions.\r\nThe twentieth century has been marked more by\r\nrivalry than by cooperation. It has been rightly\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nobserved that the majority of conflicts in which United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations take place are based\r\non ethnic, tribal or religious grounds. Separatism,\r\nespecially militant separatism, forms one of the root\r\ncauses of conflicts in our world. As the Personal\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations has said,\r\n“Just as, during the 1990s, many who went to war\r\nused the threat of diversity as a justification for\r\nconflict, perhaps in the future those who seek\r\npeace will use the spirit of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations as a means to move forward.”\r\n(A/54/546, annex, para. 14)\r\nCommon sense dictates that the calamities we\r\nhave brought upon ourselves should be avoided, and\r\nthat peace and cooperation should replace\r\nconfrontation and conflict. To achieve that goal we\r\nmust institutionalize dialogue among peoples of\r\ndifferent cultures and civilizations. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral notes,\r\n“It is the perception of diversity as a threat that is\r\nat the very origin of war.” (A/55/492, para. 4)\r\nThe many positive and mutually beneficial\r\ninteractions among civilizations and the mutual\r\nenrichment of civilizations must be cultivated and form\r\nthe basis of educating the young, especially children.\r\nWe are all part of creation, linked by common destiny\r\nand facing a challenging future. It is time for the\r\nbeauty of integration and peaceful coexistence through\r\ndiversity to be promoted and further addressed.\r\nTendencies to portray specific cultures as threats to\r\npeace must be rooted out of our teaching and\r\nschoolbooks.\r\nIn this United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, we celebrate the unity and diversity of\r\nmankind. We agree that our survival ultimately\r\ndepends on our success to promote tolerance as the\r\naccepted mode of behaviour, despite the obstacles of\r\nintolerance and aggression. Again, let us not forget\r\nMr. Picco’s words:\r\n“History does not kill. Religion does not rape\r\nwomen, the purity of blood does not destroy\r\nbuildings ... Only individuals do those things.”\r\nIt is through dialogue that my Government is\r\ncommitted to solve the problem of Cyprus. We strive\r\nfor a peaceful solution through which the two\r\ncommunities on the island may live in peace and\r\nharmony, as they did for centuries in the past without\r\noccupation troops and barbed wire.\r\nIt is with those thoughts in mind that we have\r\nagain co-sponsored draft resolution A/56/L.3, which\r\nwas pioneered by the Islamic Republic of Iran and also\r\nco-sponsored by a great number of Member States\r\nrepresenting every regional group. It contains all the\r\nelements for promoting dialogue among different\r\ncivilizations. It underlines the importance of inclusion\r\nand the enhancement of mutual understanding and\r\nprovides a programme of action for cultural,\r\neducational and social events by Governments,\r\nregional groups and non-governmental organizations.\r\nIn that regard, we commend the initiative of the\r\nvisionary and wise President of Iran, Mr. Mohammad\r\nKhatami. To the members of the Permanent Mission of\r\nIran to the United Nations, which undertook the heavy\r\ntask of promoting this lofty cause within the United\r\nNations, we extend our deep appreciation, while we\r\nwelcome among us the Group of Eminent Persons.\r\nMr. Kerim (The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): The decision of the General Assembly\r\ncontained in its resolution 53/22, of November 1998, to\r\nproclaim the year 2001 as the Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations was undoubtedly wise and most\r\nappropriate and, as such, well received across the\r\nworld.\r\nIt is not only the conceptual underpinnings of the\r\ndialogue among civilizations embodied in diversity and\r\ntolerance that justify the presence of this topic on the\r\nagenda of the United Nations; it is more than that. It is\r\nthe need to mark the beginning of the third millennium\r\nof mankind with a great cross-fertilization of cultures,\r\nto use an expression from the charter of the Académie\r\nUniverselle des Cultures in Paris, adopted when that\r\nmultinational organization of artists and scientists was\r\nestablished a few years ago.\r\nBeing in New York one does not need to\r\nundertake a journey in order to convince oneself of this\r\ntrue and visionary assessment. Here in New York we\r\nsee a reorientation of the melting pot concept in\r\npractice. Perhaps it would be better to say that a cross-\r\nfertilization of cultures exists: different cultures living\r\nshoulder-to-shoulder. Some ethnic groups have merged\r\nwith one another, others have kept themselves\r\nseparate — living in different districts, speaking\r\ndifferent languages and following different traditions.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nYet all come together on the basis of some common\r\nlaws and a common lingua franca, English.\r\nWithout even wanting to speculate about the real\r\nintentions of the perpetrators of the assault on 11\r\nSeptember in lower Manhattan, one might think of an\r\nattempt to challenge these values and way of life.\r\nWatching the replay of the cataclysmic pictures of the\r\ncollapsing World Trade Center Towers, one could ask,\r\nWhere is civilization heading? Will barbaric acts of\r\nterrorism provoke the opening of new gaps among\r\npeople, nations and religions or widen already existing\r\nones?\r\nIn order to prevent dissension along the\r\nworldwide front, one thing must be clear in the\r\ndecisive battle against terrorism: no religion, people or\r\nregion should be targeted. However, the main goal\r\nmust not be compromised, namely, to subdue\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nAs the Secretary-General aptly pointed out in his\r\nreport,\r\n“A dialogue among civilizations is not only a\r\nnecessary answer to terrorism — it is in many\r\nways its nemesis. Where terrorism seeks to divide\r\nhumanity, the dialogue aims to unite us.”\r\n(A/56/523, para. 19)\r\nOn the other hand, we have to be aware of the\r\nfact that the world we live in is far from perfect. Some\r\npeople believe there is a struggle between globalization\r\nand cultural diversity. Other people fear they will be\r\nleft behind in this great global process. These fears are\r\nnot groundless.\r\nRecognizing these fears, political leaders, as well\r\nas international organizations, including the United\r\nNations, have realized that we cannot hand over the\r\nworld to market forces alone. Recently addressing the\r\nGeneral Conference of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),\r\nFrench President Chirac said,\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“Cultural diversity is the way to counter the\r\nstandardization of cultures produced by\r\nglobalization. Diversity must be based on the\r\nconviction that each people has a specific\r\nmessage to the world, that each people can enrich\r\nhumanity by contributing its share of beauty and\r\ntruth.”\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWith such an approach in mind, we would like to\r\nemphasize that globalization cannot be separated from\r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights,\r\nindividual liberty, social justice, respect for different\r\ngroups and communities and respect for cultural\r\nidentities.\r\nThis implies that, if globalization is to be\r\ngoverned by global principles of ethics and democracy,\r\nit is necessary to follow a course that leads to no other\r\ndestination but worldwide progress. It is therefore the\r\nduty of political leaders and all other people in\r\npositions of power to civilize the process of\r\nglobalization to ensure that the interests of people — of\r\nall people — prevail.\r\nExamples are the best means of conveying a\r\nmessage in a convincing manner. In terms of the scope\r\nof the dialogue among civilizations and its worldwide\r\ndimensions, allow me to cite some examples. Is it not a\r\ncommon challenge for all societies, regardless of their\r\nreligious background, cultural roots or national\r\ntraditions, to generate sufficient opportunities for all\r\nyoung people to obtain decent and productive work in\r\nconditions of freedom, equity, security and human\r\ndignity?\r\nLet me also cite another example. A genuine\r\ndialogue between cultures and faiths could help the\r\nprotagonists find their way to peace and a prosperous\r\nfuture. Who does not remember the bitter experience of\r\nthe inter-ethnic clashes in the Balkans during the last\r\n10 years? Ethnic cleansing or the destruction of\r\nreligious sites were integral parts of these conflicts.\r\nUnfortunately, we have been witnessing them in other\r\nparts of the world, too.\r\nThese are serious warnings. Even in the age of\r\nhighly sophisticated information and communication\r\ntechnologies, mankind is suffering from the same\r\natavisms of the past, typical of medieval times or the\r\nCrusades. In terms of mankind’s history, there is also\r\nthe other side of the coin. During the period between\r\nthe eighth and the thirteenth centuries, Jews, Christians\r\nand Muslims participated in flourishing examples of\r\nscientific, artistic, medical and philosophical\r\nendeavours.\r\nIt is of particular importance to stress that the\r\ndialogue among civilizations must play a crucial role in\r\novercoming every type of fundamentalism and\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nintegralism, as the two most obvious societal forms of\r\nintolerance, regardless of their religious roots and\r\nbackgrounds.\r\nMy country, the Republic of Macedonia — being\r\na unique incarnation of the turbulent and manifold\r\nhistory of the region of south-eastern Europe where\r\nHellenic culture and Roman civilization left numerous\r\ntraces; where down through the ages Christianity and\r\nIslam fought for predominance; and where Slavic,\r\nGreek, Albanian, Roman and Turkish ethnicities have\r\nbeen interwoven — had more than good reason to be\r\namong the sponsoring countries of resolution 55/23 on\r\nthe United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, adopted by the General Assembly on 13\r\nNovember 2000.\r\nWe welcome the activities undertaken by the\r\npersonal representative of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Giandomenico Picco, working together with the\r\nDirector-General of UNESCO, along with a number of\r\nGovernments and eminent persons, various civil\r\nsociety organizations and representatives around the\r\nworld, to further the dialogue among civilizations\r\nthrough a series of organized manifestations, projects,\r\ngatherings, workshops, conferences and other events.\r\nThe Salzburg dialogue among civilizations, a new\r\nparadigm of international relations to be continued next\r\nyear; the Vilnius International Conference on Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations and the Declaration adopted on\r\nthat occasion; the International Conference on the\r\nDialogue of Civilizations in Tokyo and Kyoto; the\r\nInternational Seminar and the Tehran Declaration on\r\nEnvironment, Religion and Culture adopted on that\r\noccasion; the twenty-first century forum-symposium on\r\ndialogue among civilizations held in Beijing are a few\r\nexamples.\r\nIn accordance with the programme of action\r\nwithin the global agenda for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations envisaged in draft resolution A/56/L.3, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Boris\r\nTrajkovski, intends to undertake an initiative to host a\r\nconference or seminar on dialogue among civilizations,\r\nin the framework of UNESCO, in the year 2002 in\r\nOhrid, Macedonia.\r\nIn view of the follow-up measures, as well as the\r\nprospect of dialogue among civilizations, we must give\r\nspecial attention to the work of the Group of Eminent\r\nPersons established by the Secretary-General, which\r\nhas completed its work. The authors have embarked\r\nupon a daring mission focusing on the elaboration of a\r\nnew paradigm of international relations. The\r\nreassessment of the concept of enemy, alignments\r\nbased on issues rather than ideology, the concept of\r\nstakeholders and, finally, the decision-making system\r\nbased on equal footing and individual responsibilities\r\nare certainly crystallizing this new paradigm. Not only\r\ndoes the intellectual endeavour of the Group deserve\r\nour full respect, but we also respect it for making the\r\ndialogue a more than attractive field of discussion.\r\nThe basic values and principles of a multipolar\r\nand interdependent world differ substantially from the\r\none in which the United Nations was created. A\r\nunilateral implementation of the concept of enemy, or\r\nalignments based on issues according to the new\r\nparadigm, would require a reconsideration of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter or, at least, of some of its basic\r\nprinciples. To conduct a dialogue along these lines\r\nwould not only engender a new paradigm of\r\ninternational relations, but would also imply the\r\nbreaking of a taboo when it comes to the grass-roots of\r\nour Organization. On the other hand, one could rightly\r\npose the question: Are we really eager to make the\r\nUnited Nations a permissive Organization, bearing in\r\nmind the clear commitment enunciated and underlined\r\nin the Millennium Declaration to principles that have\r\nproved timeless and universal?\r\nIn terms of the goal of dialogue, the ongoing\r\ndiscussion concerning the equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council\r\nmay be the most convincing landmark. It shows that\r\nbuilding something together takes time and requires\r\nstamina, determination, courage and wisdom, thus\r\nbecoming at the end of the day the real form of\r\ndialogue.\r\nLet me conclude by stressing that, eventually, we\r\nall have to strive for inner courage and wisdom to help\r\ndesign an inclusive world in which diversity is\r\nperceived no longer as a threat, but as an element of\r\nprogress in the growth of our civilization.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme at the outset to convey the feelings of the State of\r\nQatar regarding this debate on the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nThis is a timely debate, given current conditions\r\nin the world. It is timely not only because of the new\r\nmillennium that has just begun — a new era in which\r\nwe had hoped there would be an increase in\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nunderstanding and awareness — but because of the\r\nviolence that is affecting most of the world. The\r\nprevious century may have been one of the bloodiest in\r\nhistory. The new century has begun with some of the\r\nmost violent events imaginable.\r\nThe new millennium is suddenly reflecting the\r\nfamiliar face of violence, hatred and anger. Is it not\r\ntime for policy makers in this culturally,\r\ntechnologically and scientifically advanced era to study\r\nthoroughly the essential elements of the concept of\r\nculture, civilization and dialogue, and to acknowledge\r\nthat such elements represent security and peace for\r\npeople throughout the world today?\r\nThere is an urgent need for humankind to ensure\r\nmoral solidarity at the global level, and for dialogue\r\namong civilizations to be accepted by all peoples as a\r\nmeans of understanding their common cultural, social\r\nand religious values. Such moral values are, in their\r\nturn, the foundation of human solidarity. They will\r\nenable us to better understand the basic causes that\r\nforce human beings to inflict pain and suffering on\r\ntheir brothers and sisters.\r\nIn the context of such human solidarity and the\r\nneed to identify a global vision based on international\r\nhumanitarian law and respect for human rights, this\r\ndialogue can help to resolve conflict among all human\r\nbeings, whether individuals or groups. Unfortunately,\r\ndespite our cultures, technological resources and\r\ntolerant religions, the world today is faced with many\r\nmore problems than it has solutions.\r\nWe need a long-term vision and policies to help\r\nus to tackle the new conditions in the world. Today,\r\nmany countries are being torn apart by armed conflict,\r\nextreme poverty and disease. Given the tragic\r\ncircumstances surrounding us, therefore, how can we\r\nundertake a dialogue among civilizations?\r\nWe need to begin such a dialogue if we are to\r\nface up to contemporary challenges such as terrorism\r\nand its causes. We need to lay the groundwork to\r\nenable future generations to develop a positive vision,\r\nto tackle existing conflicts and make dialogue among\r\npeoples our priority.\r\nDo we need war, conflict and terrorism, including\r\nState terrorism, to remind us of this? We must defend\r\npeace. And we must make every effort to create peace,\r\ninstead of just maintaining it. We must prevent crises\r\nbefore they occur. It is up to us now to promote a\r\ndialogue among civilizations, to establish a culture of\r\npeace and to learn, first and foremost, to live in peace\r\nwith ourselves and with one another so that we can\r\ntackle threats to peace and prosperity throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nThe recent terrorist attacks and their negative\r\nconsequences for international human and religious\r\nrelations remind us of what was believed in the 1990s\r\nregarding a clash among civilizations. We must\r\ntherefore pursue dialogue among civilizations and\r\nensure interaction between different cultures so that\r\nconcepts can be better analysed and harmonized and\r\nwe can reaffirm the values that certain extremists are\r\ntrying to keep us from sharing. This meeting has\r\nacquired special importance since terrorism as a global\r\nphenomenon and a political movement has been\r\nattached to Muslims and Arabs, who have become the\r\nfavourite guilty party in the eyes of the West. All we\r\nneed to do is consider the information in the Arab and\r\nother media to become aware of the fact that third\r\nworld countries are being pushed to total paralysis. The\r\nworld — particularly the Arab and Islamic world — is\r\nfaced with an intensification of the conflict of\r\ncivilizations from the religious and ethnic point of\r\nview.\r\nGlobal appeals for a cultural dialogue among\r\ncivilizations are becoming stronger. The United States\r\ncould become a leader of such a dialogue, because it is\r\na country of great cultural diversity and could set an\r\nexample in the area of social coexistence.\r\nThe State of Qatar will not be party to conflicts\r\nbetween civilizations, religions and ethnic groups.\r\nThe General Assembly should play a leading role\r\nin supporting human solidarity and promoting dialogue\r\namong civilizations and peoples for the benefit of\r\ninternational peace and security. Islam considers\r\nmurder to be an abominable crime and has encouraged\r\ndialogue between civilizations and religions. We need\r\nto undertake dialogue to resolve crises, ensure that\r\njustice reigns and avoid condemning particular ethnic\r\ngroups, nationalities or religions.\r\nThe Islamic religion tells us not to resort to\r\nterrorism and not to kill human beings unjustly. Such\r\nacts have nothing whatever to do with religion or\r\nnationalities. We must support the principle of dialogue\r\namong civilizations and the underlying principles of\r\ninternational law and human rights. These are\r\nprinciples shared by all peoples and civilizations.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nWe live in a united, though multidimensional,\r\nworld of different cultures and nationalities. The\r\nGovernments that do not heed their people will not be\r\nsuccessful. That is why we must listen to the voices of\r\nour citizens, the voices of the people, whether through\r\ncivil society, non-regional or non-governmental\r\norganizations or through the United Nations system.\r\nThe terrorists who have spread death and\r\ndestruction do not share our view of the world. They\r\nare filled with hatred and do not represent any religion\r\nor any nationality; they represent only themselves and\r\ntheir narrow political causes.\r\nThe international community should ask itself\r\nwhether it has properly protected its patrimony of\r\nwisdom, experience and duties. We must save\r\nhumankind from the evil that it has created, and we\r\nmust look to history to learn lessons. We must\r\nsafeguard the resources that we will leave to future\r\ngenerations, particularly the need to respect\r\ninternational moral and legal criteria and the principle\r\nof dialogue among civilizations, ensuring that such\r\ndialogue replaces the conflict among civilizations and\r\nthe future becomes the age of reason, wisdom, peace\r\nand security.\r\nImprovements in communications systems have\r\nbrought major advantages for all future generations\r\nbecause they enable us to exchange ideas and achieve\r\npeace. Today we are in a unique position to expand the\r\ndialogue so that it can become a genuine dialogue\r\namong civilizations throughout the world.\r\nInformation technology and progress in means of\r\ncommunication and transportation have made the\r\ndialogue among civilizations a necessity in our world.\r\nGlobalization will be welcomed as a positive process\r\nonce all peoples and civilizations are involved in\r\ndialogue rather than confrontation.\r\nThe cold war and the decades-long conflict\r\nbetween the East and West have come to an end. But\r\nsuddenly we are faced with another type of conflict:\r\nthe conflict between the East and West, some say, will\r\nbe replaced by a conflict between the North and the\r\nSouth and between the rich and the poor. This is why\r\nwe must avoid at all costs an increase in conflict\r\nbetween civilizations. The dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is very important if we wish to achieve the\r\nobjectives of eliminating racism and racial\r\ndiscrimination and consolidating human rights through\r\ncooperation and understanding.\r\nIn this respect, we must remember that diversity\r\nis a source of strength and not a cause for division. As\r\nthe Holy Koran says,\r\n“O mankind! We created\r\nYou from a single (pair)\r\nOf a male and a female,\r\nAnd made you into\r\nNations and tribes, that\r\nYe may know each other\r\n(Not that ye may despise\r\n(Each other). Verily\r\nThe most honoured of you\r\nIn the sight of Allah\r\nIs (he who is) the most\r\nRighteous of you.” (The Holy Koran, IL:13)\r\nIgnorance of the values of others or of their religions,\r\nand attitudes of supremacy and bigotry are not the view\r\nof the Koran. Almighty God created men and women to\r\ncooperate with each other and with humanity as a\r\nwhole for our common benefit. This encourages us to\r\nrecognize the rights of others and to appreciate their\r\nvalues and convictions based on justice, equality and\r\nnoble principles and ideals, as well as to try to\r\neliminate all obstacles created through\r\nmisunderstandings and mutual suspicions. The\r\ndialogue must be global and allow all to participate in\r\nthe creation of a culture of world peace.\r\nQatar, based on its domestic experience and\r\nrecognizing the genuine need to create an environment\r\nfavourable to an international dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, fully supports the concept of a dialogue\r\ninstead of a clash among civilizations. The appeal\r\nlaunched by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, Emir\r\nof the State of Qatar, at the round table held last year,\r\nto hold in Doha one of the three meetings of the Group\r\nof Eminent Persons led by Mr. Giandomenico Picco,\r\nPersonal Representative of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan for the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, is clear proof that the State of Qatar fully\r\nsupports this concept. Indeed, the third such meeting\r\nwas held in Doha on 5 September 2001.\r\nIn this respect, Qatar would like to welcome the\r\nTehran Declaration resulting from the fifth session of\r\nthe Islamic Conference of Information Ministers, held\r\nin Tehran on 1 and 2 December 1999. We also welcome\r\nthe global document on dialogue among civilizations\r\nand the substantive activities undertaken by the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. The second\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nmeeting of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts\r\nresponsible for preparing an Executive Work\r\nProgramme on Dialogue among Civilizations was held\r\nin Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 23 to 25 September 2000.\r\nWe have also supported the global document for\r\ndialogue among civilizations and the draft Global\r\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nThe dialogue we aspire to should be an open one\r\ninvolving all civilizations without exception. It should\r\nbe based on the attempt to understand the concerns,\r\ninterests and objectives of others. It should be a\r\ndialogue aimed at creating peaceful coexistence, free\r\nfrom all forms of racism, exclusion, enslavement of\r\nothers or interference in the internal affairs of other\r\nStates. It should include cultural divergences and\r\ndifferences and be aimed at creating a real future for\r\nhumanity. It should be a frank and sincere dialogue that\r\nwill produce understanding and tolerance and that will\r\nrenounce violence, hatred and aggression. The dialogue\r\namong civilizations should also affirm the legitimacy\r\nof the purposes and principles of the United Nations,\r\nstrengthen the idea of dialogues and discussions, and\r\nallow us to move forward in the area of human rights,\r\nenvironmental issues and other issues of concern to all\r\nof us.\r\nWe reaffirm the role of the United Nations in\r\nincreasing awareness among the peoples of the world\r\nof the concept of a dialogue among civilizations in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan): The dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is a unique item on our agenda. In fact, we\r\nare of the view that in many ways the entire range of\r\ndiscussions and interactions within the United Nations\r\nfamily between different peoples, cultures and ways of\r\nlife also constitute part of such a dialogue.\r\nIn my view, most of the effort and work of the\r\nUnited Nations should have the objective of pursuing\r\npeace and security through the non-violent resolution\r\nof disputes, no matter how difficult they may seem.\r\nThese efforts should also contribute to promoting\r\ntolerance and understanding among races, religions and\r\ncultures. Above all, the objective should be to\r\naccomplish peaceful coexistence among nations,\r\npeoples and their respective civilizations.\r\nWhether we talk about a dialogue among nations\r\nor civilizations, there has to be a basic premise and\r\nunderstanding from which we can continue such an\r\ninteraction. How could we describe such a premise?\r\nFirst, in our view, all civilizations taking part in\r\nsuch a dialogue have to subscribe to and faithfully\r\npractise the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, especially in their dealings with each\r\nother. This would mean that they exercise utmost\r\ntolerance, whether in respect of race, colour, religion or\r\nlevels of socio-economic development. They must\r\nconsider each other equals and equal partners on this\r\nplanet and, above all, decide to interact with the\r\nobjective of living in peace with each other.\r\nHistory has shown us that peoples have gone to\r\nwar in attempts to wipe out or dominate each other in\r\nthe name of religion and civilization. Some have taken\r\nsuch a course simply to conquer territory. The\r\ncolonization of peoples and their lands, the\r\nenslavement and exploitation of people of other races\r\nand colour, and conflicts over political ideology and\r\nreligion have all led only to gross injustice, suffering,\r\nviolence and terrorism.\r\nA great awareness dawned after the Second\r\nWorld War, when nations emerging from the ashes of\r\nthe death and destruction wrought by increasingly\r\nmodern weapons decided to establish the United\r\nNations, in order “to save succeeding generations from\r\nthe scourge of war”. Unfortunately, we are still some\r\nway from achieving this laudable goal.\r\nIf one race, religion or culture considers itself\r\nsuperior to another, and perhaps even harbours hatred\r\nand the intention of destroying the other, if it has a\r\n“we-versus-them” attitude, there simply cannot be a\r\ngenuine and peaceful dialogue. This would lead not to\r\na dialogue between civilizations but to a clash of\r\ncivilizations.\r\nIt is my understanding that civilization arises out\r\nof human evolution, through the acquisition of higher\r\nvalues, knowledge and the experience over centuries by\r\npeoples of diverse races and religions. It also consists\r\nof the experience gained through dealings between\r\ncivilizations as well as the ironing out of differences\r\nand the smoothing over of rough spots. Rarely does\r\ncivilization emerge in a state of total isolation.\r\nHence civilizations and their beliefs and practices\r\ncannot be expected to remain static. Civilizations must\r\nbe dynamic. Long-held views and beliefs, however\r\ndear or final they may seem to us, sometimes are not\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\ntenable in the context of today’s global village.\r\nPractices that harm others and that stunt the full\r\npotential of individuals, including one’s own people,\r\nand belligerent views that give rise to conflicts have to\r\nbe changed or abandoned, so that all can live in peace\r\nand cooperate to achieve common human goals.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate that peaceful\r\ncoexistence can be achieved only when civilizations\r\nlearn to adapt to changing times, peacefully to resolve\r\ndifferences with others, and give up violence, terrorism\r\nand warfare. As we witness what is happening in the\r\nworld around us, we can see that we still have to learn\r\nhow to live peacefully with each other. The terrorist\r\nattacks in the United States on 11 September and the\r\ndevelopments in Afghanistan have made this glaringly\r\nclear.\r\nIt is hoped that this dialogue will bring to the fore\r\nissues that need to be looked at more closely by the\r\ninternational community and that it will lead to\r\npeaceful coexistence and cooperation.\r\nIn our view, this should be the ultimate objective\r\nof the dialogue among civilizations.\r\nMr. Hønningstad (Norway): This dialogue\r\namong civilizations aims to encourage interaction, in\r\nits most diverse sense, among and within countries,\r\nnations, cultures and religions. This is an excellent way\r\nof promoting pluralism and tolerance, as well as the\r\nparticipation of civil society in processes of\r\ngovernance.\r\nTechnology, migration and integration are\r\nbringing people of different races, cultures and\r\nethnicities closer together, breaking down old barriers\r\nand creating new realities. The ongoing process of\r\nglobalization entails an intensified intercultural\r\ninterchange. At the same time, today’s communication\r\nopportunities present a tremendous challenge for us, in\r\nterms of increasing our ability both to understand and\r\nto make ourselves understood.\r\nWe would like to stress that the dialogue must\r\nalso encompass indigenous peoples and cultures. In\r\nthis regard, dialogue among civilizations should also\r\nbecome a vehicle to promote and ensure the enjoyment\r\nby indigenous peoples of their rights, in concert with\r\nthe indigenous peoples themselves.\r\nAlongside the world’s rich variety of\r\ncivilizations, cultures and groups, there is a global\r\ncivilization based on the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration\r\non Human Rights, which we are all called on to defend\r\nand promote. This global civilization can thus be\r\ncharacterized by its insistence on universal human\r\nrights and freedoms, its tolerance of dissent, and its\r\nbelief in the right of individuals everywhere to have a\r\nsay in how they are governed. It is a civilization based\r\non the belief that diversity is something to be\r\ncelebrated, not feared. Indeed, many conflicts are\r\nfuelled by people’s fear of those who are different.\r\nOnly through dialogue can such fears be overcome.\r\nIt is our belief that the concept of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations naturally and logically leads to an\r\naffirmation of a value that increasingly unites us all:\r\nthe universality of human rights. The United Nations\r\nitself has done a great deal to establish a culture of\r\ndialogue, and the world community has repeatedly\r\ndemonstrated its commitment to a shared existing\r\nethical foundation. At the same time, it is important to\r\nemphasize that Governments have the primary\r\nresponsibility for ensuring respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nThis year has been designated as the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. Norway\r\nwelcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nprospect of dialogue among civilizations and the\r\nactivities pertaining to the Year, as well as all the\r\npreparations and concrete initiatives that have already\r\ntaken place and those that are planned. We note with\r\nsatisfaction the work undertaken by Mr. Giandomenico\r\nPicco as personal representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nDialogue can help us distinguish lies from facts,\r\nand propaganda from sound analysis. In the light of the\r\nattacks against the United States on 11 September, the\r\nneed for global dialogue and an international\r\ncommitment against terrorism must lie at the heart of\r\nall our activities. Terrorism transcends national\r\nborders. It strikes at the core of the values that we hold\r\nto be universal and independent of our cultural\r\nbackgrounds and religious affiliations. Like the people\r\nof New York, who stand united in grief, bravery, and\r\ndetermination, so must we, the international\r\ncommunity, stand united in confronting international\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe must stand firm in rejecting any threat against\r\nthe United Nations, the main meeting place for\r\ndialogue in the world. As the concept of a dialogue\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\namong civilizations must be based on the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, the\r\nfundamental challenge for us as Members of the United\r\nNations is to strive for peace and security while never\r\ntolerating terrorist attempts to destabilize the global\r\nvalues represented by this Organization.\r\nMr. Navarrete (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, my delegation would like to convey its\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General, to his personal\r\nrepresentative for the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, and to the Director-General of the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, both for the submission of the various\r\nreports and documents which are enriching our debate\r\ntoday and for the personal and institutional\r\ncommitment that they have demonstrated in promoting\r\na lofty and relevant initiative: the promotion of a\r\ndialogue and of understanding among civilizations.\r\nWe are also grateful to the enlightened\r\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran for having\r\nproposed the introduction of this very important topic\r\nfor discussion, as well as for having initiated\r\nconsideration of a draft resolution, the broad\r\nsponsorship of which augurs well for its adoption by\r\nconsensus.\r\nThe atrocious terrorist acts of 11 September and\r\ntheir consequences for the political and economic areas\r\nand for international peace and security, among others,\r\nmake it even more urgent to make dialogue a constant,\r\npermanent and favoured tool in attempting to resolve\r\nthe differences arising out of our diversity at all levels:\r\nlocal, national, bilateral, regional and global.\r\nThe subject that we are examining today, complex\r\nin itself, includes both directly and indirectly concepts,\r\nsuch as culture and civilization, that are distinguished\r\nby their changeability, evolution and diversity as well\r\nas by the complexity of their interactions.\r\nWe know that culture, in its broadest sense, is\r\neverything we possess as living beings through\r\nlearning from or imitating our fellow human beings.\r\nLanguage, food, dance, clothing and everything that we\r\nhave learned form part of our culture. The term is\r\nextremely broad. There is not and cannot be a human\r\ncommunity without culture.\r\nCivilization is something else. The concept comes\r\nfrom the Latin word for city. It has two principal\r\naspects: the mode of understanding the universe and its\r\nmanifestations in art, religion, science and technology,\r\namong others; and the mode of social organization,\r\nespecially the State and laws. To civilize means to\r\nsubject to reason, to apply the rationality of thought,\r\nreligion or law.\r\nIn this context, just as there is not and cannot be a\r\nhuman community without culture, there can be and\r\nare uncivilized communities. Where there is no\r\nrationality, there is no civilized life.\r\nOn the other hand, dialogue, or the confrontation\r\nof different positions, is the best way to clarify a\r\nproblem, to shed light on what is uncertain. In this\r\nsense, Plato said thought is a dialogue with oneself; in\r\nthe intimate and solitary act of exercising thought,\r\nthere is a hidden dialogue. This is because thinking is\r\ntied closely to presenting arguments, explaining, giving\r\nreasons.\r\nBut it is very difficult, perhaps impossible, to\r\nunderstand oneself without subjecting one’s own\r\narguments to the scrutiny and objections of others.\r\nHere again we see the link between dialogue and\r\nthought. To think is to engage in dialogue.\r\nSeen from this point of view, dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is a paean to diversity and pluralism.\r\nDiversity in both the biological and human worlds is\r\nrich and creative. Diversity is life; it is, as scientists\r\nsay, order. On the other hand, in the uniform and\r\nglobal, one cannot identify what is particular and\r\ndifferent from the rest. What makes the story of\r\nhumanity fascinating is that each of us is different. The\r\nsame can be said about history: each nation is different,\r\nwith peculiarities that distinguish it from the rest.\r\nTherefore, the only way in which we can enrich\r\nourselves both spiritually and materially is to reach out\r\nto what is different — other perspectives and views.\r\nDialogue, for its part, presupposes respect for the\r\ndiversity and peculiarity of the other. It is not a matter\r\nof erasing diversity or of unifying by cancelling.\r\nIncorporating means adding together what is diverse,\r\nconserving its distinctive peculiarity as it becomes part\r\nof one common goal.\r\nThe example of Europe is illustrative. Europe was\r\nalways a cauldron of cultures: an enormous diversity of\r\npeoples in a territory that was not very large. As a\r\nresult, European cultures made notable progress where\r\nthey lived together, next to one another. In contrast, as\r\nthe Mexican writer Octavio Paz pointed out, the\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\ngreatest difficulty for the development of pre-Hispanic\r\ncultures in what is now Latin America was their total\r\nisolation and lack of dialogue with each other.\r\nDifferent cultures and civilizations can\r\nunderstand each other only by engaging in dialogue.\r\nUnderstanding a civilization means nothing more than\r\ngrasping it as a similar response — of the same kind\r\nbut with specific differences — to the needs and ideals\r\nof the civilization known to us. In other words,\r\ndialogue means making a civilization different from\r\nours become our own.\r\nWhen dialogue fails and understanding of a\r\ndifferent civilization does not result, we tend to view\r\nthat civilization as totally different from us, and often\r\nhostile. There is not much distance between lack of\r\nunderstanding, hostility and conflict. Confrontation,\r\nfrom this point of view, is a result of the failure of\r\nmutual understanding — the breakdown of dialogue.\r\nConfrontation encompasses the desire to destroy what\r\nwe cannot understand. Lack of understanding, the\r\nbreakdown of dialogue and the will to destroy go hand\r\nin hand.\r\nProof that dialogue among civilizations is not\r\neasy can be found by looking at human history as a\r\nwhole. Conflict and war between various groups have\r\nperhaps been more common and frequent than peace\r\nand harmony.\r\nThe perpetual peace of which Immanuel Kant\r\nspoke remains an ideal to be attained. If there is human\r\nmoral progress — which, despite everything, seems\r\ncertain — it should be reflected primarily in the effort\r\nto understand, through dialogue, cultures and\r\ncivilizations different from ours that appear before us.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to express its\r\nfull agreement with the observation, contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, that cultural and religious\r\ndiversity is a source of strength and not a cause of\r\ndivision and conflict. My delegation also shares the\r\nbelief that the United Nations — this forum —\r\ncontinues to be the natural place for the dialogue\r\namong civilizations, the forum where that dialogue can\r\nflourish, be fruitful and help achieve the objectives of\r\nmaintaining peace and promoting human development.\r\nMr. Lancry (Israel) (spoke in French): In this\r\nGeneral Assembly discussion devoted to the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, I\r\nthought it appropriate to include in my statement a\r\nbrief introduction in Arabic.\r\nOf course, my mastery of classical Arabic will\r\nforever remain imperfect. Having acquired the\r\nrudiments of this language during my Moroccan\r\nadolescence, I am trying, at the United Nations, to\r\nupdate the distant echoes that carry the magic of\r\nyesteryear back to me. Therefore, in tribute to the\r\nlanguage of my youth, I have decided to include this\r\nfragment in Arabic as a miniature illustration of our\r\ndiscussion.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nI wish to begin my statement in Arabic as an\r\nexpression of the dialogue between cultures and\r\ncivilizations. In my country, the Arabic language is\r\nconsidered the second official language.\r\nI consider myself fortunate to be able to read and\r\nwrite in the beautiful Arabic language, but\r\nunfortunately that is not enough. My effort to learn\r\nArabic is one of the incentives for contact with and\r\nrespect for this language, which is part of my culture,\r\nas I was born in Morocco.\r\nI am fully confident that the dialogue among\r\nlanguages and cultures in our region will help create\r\nthe necessary language of peace, not only to achieve\r\npolitical peace, but also to sow reconciliation and\r\ncoexistence among the peoples of the region. As the\r\nsaying goes, by spreading one people’s culture to\r\nanother, the stupidity of war will be avoided.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn our preceding statements on the dialogue\r\namong civilizations, we have, in the context of general\r\nconsensus, indicated our unreserved support for, and\r\ndesire to participate actively in, the dialogue.\r\nWith regard to the State of Israel, the modern\r\nincarnation of an ancient people, the shared\r\nfoundations of three monotheistic religions and their\r\nscriptural, spiritual and intertextual manifestations are\r\na generating force for dialogue and openness.\r\nThe history of humanity, based for too long on\r\nnegating the other, on the supremacy claimed by a\r\nphilosophy, an ideology, a race, a culture, a truth or a\r\nrevelation, is a history in which man has been\r\ndestroyed in the most appalling disasters.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nThroughout the centuries, the implacable\r\nantagonism between civilizations, the superimposition\r\nof one culture on another, the attempts by one race to\r\nobliterate another have been tragic tendencies, a source\r\nof chaos and misfortune in our world.\r\nOn this list of disaster marked by the subjugation\r\nof man by man in the name of triumphant ideologies,\r\nsome bright periods, some sustained peaks, guided\r\nhumankind towards salvation. The Renaissance, the\r\nEnlightenment, the Judeo-Arab Golden Age in\r\nmedieval Spain, the thousands of years of Jews living\r\nin the Maghreb, the ancient Egypt of Joseph or that of\r\nthe wise men of Alexandria, the Persia of Cyrus and\r\nDarius — dialogue and respect for diversity were the\r\ndriving forces of these peak periods of our civilization.\r\nIn diversity harmoniously lived, the differences\r\nare interwoven without being nullified; they flourish,\r\nwithout one rising at the expense of the others. They\r\noften converge to introduce new differences. It is in\r\nthese median areas that differences of cultural\r\ncrossbreeding emerge, where borders transform into\r\nvibrating membranes that thwart closure and isolation.\r\nIn order to intensify the dialogue among civilizations,\r\nwe must cross our own mental borders, pierce our\r\nideological walls and dig tunnels under our ramparts of\r\ninhibitions, so that the best of ourselves can first ooze\r\nand then spurt liberating words.\r\nIt is through contact with areas of cultural\r\nmixture, at the intersection of diverse areas, histories\r\nand civilizations, where dialogue and understanding are\r\npossible, that mankind is able to trace its future in\r\npeace.\r\nIn a world that is prey to isolation and\r\nManichaean divisions such as those that produced the\r\nhorror of 11 September, a living and diversified\r\ndialogue among civilizations is the antidote to\r\nfundamentalist terrorism and its nebulous carriers of\r\ndeath, destruction and suicidal impulse.\r\nAfter the unspeakable disaster of 11 September,\r\nthere is an urgent need to extend the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations and promote interfaith dialogue. This is a\r\nresponsibility that is incumbent first and foremost on\r\nthe family of nations and on its spiritual, political and\r\nintellectual leaders. The chief Organization, the United\r\nNations, led by a visionary Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, and his remarkable Personal Representative for\r\nthe dialogue among civilizations, Mr. Giandomenico\r\nPicco, are useful —indeed, essential — catalysts in this\r\nvast and valuable project for our century.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): I would like to begin by\r\nexpressing to Mr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami,\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, my country’s\r\nrespect for the devotion with which he pursues the\r\nvision of a dialogue among civilizations. Our\r\nappreciation and respect also go to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, for supporting this initiative and\r\npromoting it within the United Nations system.\r\nInitiatives like the one we are addressing today\r\nappear on the international agenda at very specific\r\ntimes in human history. At the threshold of the new\r\nmillennium, which undoubtedly will be the millennium\r\nof human expansion into the universe, there is a\r\ngrowing understanding that the human race can no\r\nlonger be weakened by cultural, religious and\r\nideological differences. Such differences should instead\r\nbe turned into an inexhaustible source of strength,\r\ninspiration and new ideas. A dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is both a sign of mankind’s maturity and\r\nan instrument for its progress.\r\nIn fact, the entire concept of a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations leads us to the realization that there exists\r\nonly one human civilization, which is extraordinarily\r\nrich and diverse, as exceptionally manifold as the\r\nhuman species itself. Therefore, a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations will eventually evolve into the self-\r\nknowledge of humanity, without which the human\r\nquest for perfection will never be accomplished.\r\nIn today’s world, more and more people have\r\nbegun to realize that they belong to more than one\r\ncivilization. Multiculturalism has become a reality, and\r\nit can grow to become a universal standard for cultural\r\nself-identification in the twenty-first century. Of\r\ncourse, this process should not be artificially\r\naccelerated or enforced. The unfortunate reality that\r\nseveral mini-cultures and micro-civilizations vanish\r\neach decade from the face of our planet, even in remote\r\nand hardly accessible regions, cannot be perceived as a\r\nnecessary and unavoidable sacrifice on the altar of\r\nglobalization. There are, and will be, societies and\r\ngroups of people for whom cultural globalization can\r\nbe, or already has been, very painful. The international\r\ncommunity must respect the right to cultural self-\r\ndetermination in the same manner as the right to\r\npolitical self-determination. There are small ethnic\r\ngroups in today’s world which, despite their modest\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\ndemographics, are the living heirs of great past\r\ncivilizations. Many of them are forgotten and\r\nneglected. Some are endangered in their own\r\nhomelands, such as, for example, the Assyrians, who\r\nkeep alive the Aramaic tongue of Jesus Christ. Such\r\nethnic and religious groups should be regarded as the\r\ncultural heritage of all mankind, and a special approach\r\nshould be taken to their needs and aspirations.\r\nBut there is opposition to dialogue of a\r\ncompletely different kind, which springs from a notion\r\nof cultural superiority. Calling others “inferiors”,\r\n“barbarians” or “infidels” is a sign of cultural\r\ninsularity, which provides fertile soil for ethnic and\r\nreligious intolerance and far too often manifests itself\r\nin acts of violence and terrorism. It is regrettable that\r\nduring the International Year of Dialogue Among\r\nCivilizations we suffered the unspeakable horror of 11\r\nSeptember. This tragedy has revived the ill-fated theory\r\nabout a clash among civilizations, which seems to have\r\nacquired many new adherents. The seriousness of this\r\ntheory should not be underestimated. We should be\r\nhonest with ourselves, and we have to admit that the\r\nclash is no less real and no less likely than the\r\ndialogue. It is a serious threat, and it is a bold\r\nchallenge to the adherents to dialogue and to the\r\nUnited Nations itself. It is up to all of us to determine\r\nthe possible course of human history. In this regard, we\r\nwould like to mention the valuable contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nmade by the World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,\r\nheld earlier this year in Durban, South Africa.\r\nThe lesson that we must learn today is simple:\r\npolitical actions and military operations can destroy\r\ntraining camps and terrorist infrastructures. They can\r\nbring to justice the persons responsible for crimes\r\nagainst humanity, but they cannot destroy completely\r\nthe ideology motivating them and poisoning their\r\nminds with hatred. This is where initiatives like the\r\ndialogue among civilizations can prove to be effective.\r\nBut the dialogue should not limit itself to high podiums\r\nand scientific conferences. It should find immediate\r\nand effective ways to reach out to ordinary people in\r\nthe streets, who are often dangerously influenced by\r\nextreme nationalists and religious fanatics.\r\nThe concept of a dialogue among civilizations is\r\nnew and still very fragile. Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan rightly noted that even the discussion of the\r\ndialogue among civilizations can be conducted in such\r\na way that it actually reinforces barriers to dialogue\r\ninstead of bringing them down. During the last session\r\nof the General Assembly, we already witnessed some\r\nattempts to use this agenda item for negative\r\npropagandistic purposes. We strongly reject such\r\nmoves and urge all Member States to spare no efforts\r\nin preserving the original hate-free nature of this\r\ninitiative.\r\nMr. Shobokshi (Saudi Arabia), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nI represent a country that may be considered a\r\nsuccess story of interaction of cultures and\r\ncivilizations. Being the heir of the great ancient\r\ncivilizations of eastern Anatolia, Armenia later\r\ndeveloped a culture that bore remarkable similarities to\r\nneighbouring Zoroastrian and Greco-Roman\r\ncivilizations. A Christian nation since 301 A.D., and\r\nspeaking an Indo-European language, Armenians are\r\nnaturally attached to Europe culturally, spiritually and\r\nlinguistically. At the same time we have a deep\r\nknowledge and understanding of the neighbouring\r\nIslamic civilization, which we have learned to respect\r\nduring centuries of coexistence and active interaction.\r\nWe want to confirm once again from this podium our\r\nstrong commitment to the idea of a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, which promises a much better future for\r\nhumanity on this small planet.\r\nMr. Widodo (Indonesia): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report in document A/56/523 and to the eminent\r\npersons who contributed to the publication of the book\r\nentitled Crossing the Divide: Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. My delegation would also like to\r\nrecognize the foresight of President Seyed Mohammad\r\nKhatami of the Islamic Republic of Iran on this\r\ninitiative. Likewise, we would like to take this occasion\r\nto recognize the financial contribution that has been\r\nmade by the Government of Switzerland to the trust\r\nfund established for the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations.\r\nThe celebration of this United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations and the many activities\r\nthat have taken place indeed encourage us. As a multi-\r\nethnic, multi-religious and multilingual country,\r\nIndonesia embraces the need for tolerance and\r\nunderstanding through dialogue. The Year was marked\r\nby a peaceful transition of power and a further\r\nstrengthening of the democratic process in Indonesia\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.41\r\nand the beginning of a more stable era. We therefore\r\nfully subscribe to the basic principle that the necessary\r\npolitical will must be exercised to ensure a dialogue\r\namong the groups concerned in society and that it must\r\nbe carried out at the local, national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. Moreover, the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations should become a soft tool of diplomacy\r\nthat will ultimately prove cost effective and successful\r\nin our joint efforts to prevent, combat and eradicate\r\nconflict, violence and terrorism.\r\nOur own political problems in Aceh, the\r\nMaluccas and Irian Jaya provinces are being duly\r\naddressed through dialogue. The Government of\r\nIndonesia does encourage a free exchange of views\r\nthrough a free press. Various groups in our society are\r\nworking together to solve the problems of globalization\r\nand economic uncertainty. Dialogue is alive and well in\r\nIndonesia.\r\nIntegral to that effort is the contribution made by\r\nnon-governmental organizations in particular, and by\r\nmembers of civil society. It is our experience that these\r\nbodies can be effectively utilized as venues for\r\ndialogue between groups representing different\r\nconstituencies and as mechanisms for building\r\nconfidence and trust.\r\nIndonesia is also of the view that it is imperative\r\nto have such a dialogue at the regional level, where it\r\ncan contribute to confidence-building measures and\r\ncreate an atmosphere of understanding. I would recall\r\nthat the Declaration of the Tehran seminar on dialogue\r\namong civilizations did emphasize, among other things,\r\nthat the dialogue can enhance our mutual\r\nunderstanding and knowledge about different cultures,\r\nshould enhance cooperation in addressing threats to\r\nglobal peace, security and well-being, and should\r\nenrich the promotion and protection of all human\r\nrights.\r\nAt the global level, Indonesia’s commitment to\r\nthe dialogue among civilizations is appropriately\r\nreflected in our co-sponsorship of the Global Agenda\r\nand its Programme of Action. The task now is to ensure\r\nthat the necessary financial resources are made\r\navailable for a successful implementation of the\r\nProgramme.\r\nMy delegation joins others in the belief that the\r\nUnited Nations is the natural home of the dialogue and\r\nthe only multilateral forum where it can flourish and\r\nmanifest itself in genuine and concrete achievements.\r\nThrough the framework of the United Nations, we are\r\nconfident that the dialogue among civilizations will\r\nbecome the new paradigm of international relations for\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nOur commitment to the venue of the United\r\nNations for this purpose is, we believe, vindicated by\r\nthe tragic events of 11 September 2001. The\r\ntremendous loss of life and the subsequent unfolding\r\nevents lend added importance and urgency to the role\r\nof this Organization in seeking internationally\r\nacceptable solutions to issues of peace and security and\r\nin promoting development, in full conformity with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nIndonesia will continue to contribute to the\r\nsuccess of that effort and to the success of a dialogue\r\namong civilizations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item for this meeting. We\r\nshall continue to hear speakers in the debate on this\r\nitem tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.50 p.m.\r\n"
