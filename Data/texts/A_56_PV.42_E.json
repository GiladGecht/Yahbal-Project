(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 25 (continued)\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/56/523)\r\nDraft resolution (A/56/L.3)\r\nThe President: At this meeting of the General\r\nAssembly, we are discussing what the United Nations\r\nshould and can do to promote understanding and\r\ndialogue among civilizations. The General Assembly,\r\nrecognizing that this question is closely bound up with\r\nissues of peace and security, economic prosperity and\r\nhuman rights — which are central to the work of our\r\nOrganization — has taken up and considered the item\r\nsince the fifty-third session in 1998.\r\nSince then, the General Assembly has adopted\r\nseveral important resolutions regarding this item and\r\nthe Secretary-General has reported on the\r\nimplementation of the resolutions. However, as we near\r\nthe end of the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations, I\r\nbelieve it is appropriate and timely for the General\r\nAssembly to provide a strong impetus for further\r\nprogress in this vital area. In particular, we expect that\r\nthe draft resolution entitled “Global agenda for\r\ndialogue among civilizations” will be adopted by\r\nconsensus after today’s debate. It is my view that the\r\nglobal agenda, if adopted, will mark a milestone in our\r\nefforts to promote dialogue among civilizations.\r\nOver the course of millennia, humankind has\r\ndeveloped and nurtured a wealth of cultures and\r\ncivilizations. From the beginning of history, they have\r\ninteracted with and enriched each other, while\r\ncontributing to the progress of humankind as a whole.\r\nAs globalization accelerates and is driven forward by\r\nadvanced technologies, the process of cultural\r\ninteraction and exchange is also accelerating.\r\nThe United Nations designated the year 1995 as\r\nthe United Nations Year for Tolerance and proclaimed\r\n2001 as the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. Indeed, tolerance and dialogue should be\r\nincluded among the core values of the international\r\ncommunity. Without them, peace and security cannot\r\nbe achieved and would hardly be worth achieving.\r\nMoreover, they are instrumental to the pursuit of\r\nhuman rights and human freedom.\r\nWe find ourselves at a critical juncture in history.\r\nAlong with the advent of the age of globalization,\r\nterrorism has now surfaced as the major threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Terrorism represents\r\nthe very embodiment of intolerance. All great\r\ncivilizations and religions in history have preached\r\ntolerance and compassion. Dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, by promoting tolerance, undermines the\r\nbasis of terrorism and thus contributes to global peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn our globalizing and increasingly\r\ninterconnected world, diverse cultures can provide a\r\nneeded source of stability and continuity. The\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nchallenge is to balance this need against the risk of\r\ncultural stagnation. There is no simple solution, but we\r\nmust always remember that cultures are living,\r\nevolving entities, not lifeless artefacts. I hope that this\r\nis one of many important lessons that the dialogue has\r\ntaught us.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to extend a warm\r\nwelcome to the eminent persons from all over the\r\nworld who have come here to address this Assembly. I\r\nthank them very much. I have no doubt that their\r\npresentations will do much to make this dialogue one\r\nof the United Nations foremost contributions to cross-\r\ncultural understanding.\r\nIn closing, let me express my gratitude to the\r\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its\r\ninitiative in proposing this agenda item. I wish all the\r\nparticipants a very productive and successful dialogue,\r\nthus advancing the goals and ideals for which the\r\nUnited Nations stands.\r\nI call on the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: It is a special pleasure\r\nfor me to join the General Assembly for a debate on a\r\nsubject of profound moral and political significance to\r\nthe United Nations. If ever one doubted the need for a\r\ndialogue among civilizations, let them doubt no longer.\r\n11 September made the need for such a dialogue\r\ncrystal-clear.\r\nThat is why our response — the response of the\r\nUnited Nations — must be to bring nations, cultures\r\nand civilizations ever closer together through dialogue\r\nand cooperation. Throughout history, civilizations have\r\ngrown and flourished through dialogue and exchange,\r\nlearning from other cultures and finding new\r\ninspiration to pursue knowledge and understanding.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations is a central\r\npillar of the global response to conflict and violence of\r\nevery kind, particularly when it is based on bigotry and\r\nintolerance. With this dialogue taking place in every\r\npart of the world, appeals to war will be met with\r\nappeals to compromise. Hatred will be met with\r\ntolerance. Violence will be met with resolve. A\r\ndialogue among civilizations is humanity’s best answer\r\nto humanity’s worst enemies.\r\nI wish to pay tribute to President Khatami of Iran\r\nfor launching the dialogue among civilizations within\r\nthe United Nations and to other leaders and\r\nGovernments who have sustained this dialogue over\r\nthe last year. By doing so, they have not only advanced\r\nan essential vehicle of understanding, but served the\r\nnoblest aims of the United Nations. Over the last year,\r\nthe idea of a dialogue among civilizations has\r\nengendered wide interest in academic institutions, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and wherever people have\r\nsought to find common ground.\r\nFrom Austria to Costa Rica to Egypt, Mali, Korea\r\nand many other countries, Governments and civil\r\nsociety have joined United Nations agencies in\r\nadvancing this dialogue and bringing its message to\r\nevery culture and continent. A special contribution has\r\nbeen made by the Group of Eminent Persons, as the\r\nPresident has indicated, and I would like to\r\ncongratulate them on their service to humanity and to\r\nthe United Nations. I thank them very much.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations is based not on\r\nthe premise that we, as humanity, are all the same or\r\nalways in agreement, but rather on appreciation of the\r\nfact that we represent a diversity of cultures and that\r\nour beliefs reflect this diversity. The idea that there is\r\none people in possession of the truth, one answer to the\r\nworld’s ills, or one solution to humanity’s needs has\r\ndone immense harm throughout history. We need look\r\nno further than the composition of this great Assembly\r\nto know — as an unmistakable, incontrovertible fact of\r\nlife — that there are many ways of living, many\r\nbeliefs, many cultures.\r\nIt is when this diversity of identities is under\r\nsiege, when a way of life is denied, when the basic\r\nfreedom to live as one chooses is threatened, that\r\nconflict, violence and suffering become inevitable.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations, in this sense, is\r\nnot an expression of hopes, but a reflection of the\r\nworld as it is. Diversity is the basis for the dialogue\r\namong civilizations and the reality that makes dialogue\r\nnecessary. We understand as never before that, however\r\ndiverse we are, we are fully human and fully worthy of\r\nthe respect and dignity that are essential to our\r\ncommon humanity.\r\nWe recognize that we are the products of many\r\ncultures and memories; that tolerance allows us to\r\nstudy and learn from other cultures; that our strengths\r\nlie in combining the familiar with the foreign; and that\r\nthose who perceive diversity as a threat deny\r\nthemselves and their societies the best of humanity.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nAll of us have the right to take pride in our\r\nparticular faith or heritage. But the notion that what is\r\n“ours” is necessarily in conflict with what is “theirs” is\r\nboth false and dangerous. In contrast to what some\r\nwould suggest, we can love what we are without hating\r\nwhat we are not.\r\nOf course, there are often profound and very real\r\nissues of self-determination, security and dignity at\r\nstake in the relations between peoples. Words alone\r\nwill not resolve them. But a dialogue of words and\r\ndeeds — that is, of reciprocal actions based on respect\r\nand a genuine understanding of the other side’s\r\ngrievances — can resolve disputes and prevent\r\nconflict.\r\nI am not saying that this dialogue will be easy.\r\nBut we must not allow the difficulties we will face to\r\ndeter us from pursuing it. I am convinced that it can\r\nmake a genuine difference in the lives of ordinary men\r\nand women throughout the world. Ultimately, that is\r\nthe standard by which this dialogue will be measured:\r\nits ability to help alleviate suffering and protect the\r\nfundamental human rights of future generations.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations has a purpose\r\nand promise beyond the challenges we face today.\r\nThroughout history, such dialogue has fostered\r\nunderstanding and compromise, and can do so to an\r\neven greater extent in a world that is ever smaller and\r\nmore closely linked. It can support and sustain every\r\neffort at peace and every attempt to resolve conflicts\r\nbetween and within nations.\r\nIt is my hope that, in the months and years ahead,\r\nall nations will join this dialogue and make it genuinely\r\nvaluable by placing it at the service of the weakest and\r\nmost vulnerable of our world: the victims of\r\nintolerance, bigotry and hatred. It is for their sake that\r\nthe dialogue among civilizations must succeed.\r\nPresident Khatami (Islamic Republic of Iran)\r\n(spoke in Persian; English text provided by the\r\ndelegation): In the circle of those who cherished\r\nrational thinking 2,500 years ago, Socrates would\r\nemploy the method of dialogue to discuss philosophical\r\nquestions. Those who, unlike the philosophers, felt less\r\nlove for wisdom yet showed more passion to possess\r\nit — that is, the sophists — did all they could to defeat\r\nSocrates, and when his life was found to contradict\r\ntheir interests and credibility, they eventually had him\r\nput to death.\r\nThe call to dialogue, however, did not die with\r\nSocrates. In places of learning and places of worship,\r\nas well as in forums on world politics and culture, we\r\ncan still hear Socrates inviting us to dialogue. That\r\nappeal transcends realms of formal learning and\r\nphilosophy, for Socrates was more than a philosopher.\r\nHe was, indeed, a great mentor of morality and a\r\nmaster of culture and politics. It is precisely for this\r\nreason that dialogue presupposes and embodies a\r\nprincipled moral discipline of culture and politics.\r\nToday, as in ancient centuries, engagement in\r\ndialogue requires wisdom, discipline and goodwill.\r\nToday, as then, any exclusive claim to absolute truth\r\nneeds to be relinquished. Truth, as absolute as it is in\r\nits essence, should drive us, in the light of its true\r\nunity, not only to recognize plurality in human culture,\r\nreligion, language and race, but also to embrace this\r\nvariety as a unique opportunity for establishing peace,\r\nfreedom and justice in our world. In order to do this,\r\nwe will need to stop playing deaf. Devastating wars\r\nhave always erupted when one party has refused to\r\nlisten to what others have had to say.\r\nWhen Iran proposed the idea of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations in the General Assembly, few foresaw\r\nhow soon this proposal could be so instrumental in\r\nsaving the world from an imminent war of carnage and\r\ndevastation. The horrific terrorist attacks on the United\r\nStates of 11 September were perpetrated by a cult of\r\nfanatics who had mutilated their own ears and tongues\r\nand were able to communicate with perceived\r\nopponents only through carnage and devastation. A\r\nperceived need for revenge, coupled with a misplaced\r\nsense of might, could lead to failure to hear the calls of\r\npeople of goodwill and the cries of children, women\r\nand the elderly in Afghanistan, whose lot in life has\r\nbeen no more than to suffer a prolonged death in the\r\nshadow of perpetual horror, hunger and disease.\r\nIn the opening years of the twentieth century,\r\nsome prominent political thinkers rightly prophesied\r\nthe imminence of a century of war and revolution. This\r\nwas later attributed to the escalation of violence in the\r\ntwentieth century, and violence was seen as a\r\ncharacteristic common to both wars and revolutions.\r\nWar, of course, is always concomitant with\r\nviolence. But it would be incorrect to identify all\r\nrevolutions with violence. One could cite examples of\r\nrevolutions based on the very renunciation of violence.\r\nApt consideration of the liberation movement in India\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nshould suffice to patently rebut such a claim. The\r\nIslamic revolution in Iran, which in a sense breathed\r\nthe soul of morality back into the body politic, was also\r\na revolution that responded to bullets with flowers and\r\ndid not combat its opponents exclusively with\r\nretaliation and revenge. It was the Government that\r\nemerged from our revolution that eventually, in the\r\nclosing years of the twentieth century, proposed to the\r\nUnited Nations the idea of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nI am grateful to this august body for embracing\r\nthis proposal; to the Secretary-General and his Personal\r\nRepresentative for their invaluable efforts; and to the\r\nGroup of Eminent Persons for its thought-provoking\r\nand insightful contribution in its recently published\r\nbook, Crossing the Divide: Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations.\r\nI am also pleased to introduce, on behalf of the\r\nco-sponsors, the draft resolution (A/C.1/56/L.3),\r\n“Global agenda on the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, which has been\r\nprepared in a true spirit of dialogue. We hope that this\r\nimportant document receives the unanimous support of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nRegrettably, the dawn of the new millennium has\r\nturned out to be bloody and filled with gloom. The\r\napparatus of terror and violence did not pause for a\r\nmoment. A most brutal and appalling crime has been\r\nperpetrated against American civilians.\r\nIn the name of the people and the Government of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, I have firmly and\r\nunequivocally condemned this inhuman and anti-\r\nIslamic act of terror. I have already asked the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations to bring\r\ntogether heads of State to set an agenda for combating\r\nterrorism and to unify international political will in\r\nuprooting this evil phenomenon. This moment provides\r\nthe most opportune time to reflect upon the causes and\r\nmeans of this catastrophe.\r\nIn our world today, the concept of political\r\nseclusion transgresses the boundaries of morality and\r\nfalls into the realm of impossibility. All cultures,\r\ncivilizations and faiths are now compelled to inhabit\r\nthe same world by the inviolable verdict of technology.\r\nNow is therefore the best of times to bring about\r\nharmony and foster empathy amid diversity. A rare\r\nopportunity has now presented itself, which could lead\r\neither to interminable war or to enduring peace and\r\ncompassion among human societies.\r\nTerrorism is begotten through the ominous\r\ncombination of blind fanaticism and brute force, and it\r\nalways serves a systematized illusion. In spite of the\r\npropaganda it utilizes and the nomenclature it employs,\r\nterrorism is nothing more than a projection of the\r\ndestructive forces of the human unconscious.\r\nShould human beings be deprived of compassion\r\nand divested of morality, religious spirituality, a sense\r\nof aesthetics and the ability to engage in poetic\r\nvisualization, and should they become incapable of\r\nexperiencing death and destruction through artistic\r\ncreativity, then the horrendous hidden forces of the\r\nunconscious would wreak havoc, death and devastation\r\nupon the world of humanity.\r\nWhoever chooses to reduce religion, art or\r\nscience to a destructive weapon bears no other than an\r\ninimical relationship to them.\r\nIn the intellectual world of Iran and Islam,\r\nmagnificent achievements attained in the realm of\r\nliterature are all rooted deeply in the rich resources of\r\nthe divine revelation and Islamic tradition. For\r\ninstance, such an understanding of tradition would be\r\nexpressed by a Muslim mystic saying:\r\n“From the East to the West, should any one man\r\nbe hurt by a thorn in his finger or by a stone in\r\nhis way, I would feel the pain. My heart would\r\nshare the burden of any heart encumbered with\r\nchagrin.”\r\nIn the same way, the essence of religious spirituality is\r\nexpressed by a poet writing in the Zen tradition: “If I\r\nhad had a black cloak large enough, I would have\r\ncovered all the needy of the world.”\r\nHuman beings are capable of unbounded love.\r\nThis is shown in the Gospels, which present the love\r\nbetween neighbours as on par with the love of God.\r\nThe Upanishads teach that the human soul, the lily of\r\nthe heart, grows from the soil out of which all human\r\nbeings have been created. Precisely because of the\r\nhomogeneity of this common soil, which cannot be\r\nmoulded by politics and geography, empathic dialogue\r\namong human beings is possible.\r\nA Manichaean perspective on world geopolitics,\r\nwhich dualistically assumes one religion to be the\r\nsource of light and the other the source of darkness,\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nwould have appalling political and security\r\nconsequences. The ancient trick of “making enemies”\r\nis a product of paranoid illusion, but its products are\r\nnonetheless real.\r\nAnother question remains to be elaborated: in\r\nwhat soil would the seed of enmity and the making of\r\nenemies grow and produce such unpalatable fruit? It is\r\nevident that the seed of infinite enmity grows well\r\nwherever infinite injustice is entrenched and begets\r\nutter despair and frustration. Politicians and military\r\ngenerals could simply attribute the recent catastrophe\r\nin the United States, as well as all terrorist atrocities\r\nand casualties in various regions, to the evil deeds of a\r\ncertain State, group or religion. Yet this would simply\r\namount to evading the question, not answering it. The\r\ncorrect answer to this question, like many other correct\r\nanswers in philosophy and politics, has a long history.\r\nHowever, a long history does not provide a remedy in\r\nand of itself. We can hope to learn a new lesson from\r\nan old answer only if we are prepared to accept the\r\nverdict of fairness and justice.\r\nInjustice is neither unknown to nor confined to\r\nparticular communities. However, when injustice\r\naccumulates so much that it engenders despair and\r\nfrustration, it turns into an explosive brew. Only when\r\npeople are deprived of a right to life — merely life as\r\nsurvival, not even a good life of equality — do they\r\nbecome capable of perpetrating crimes of which they\r\nare the first victims. People should not be led into utter\r\ndespair. I intend this not merely as humanitarian\r\nadvice, but also as a precondition for social and\r\npolitical coexistence in a world in which our fates are\r\ninevitably intertwined. Even for those of us who have\r\nlost the capacity to have compassion for others, and\r\nwhose motivation is based on self-love and an urge to\r\nsurvive, it remains imperative not to push others into\r\nthe dark realm of frustration. A frustrated person may\r\nchoose death as the only remedy of his predicament:\r\nhis own death and the death of others. At least part of\r\nour minds and hearts need to be set free from the\r\nclutches of instrumental and utilitarian reason and be\r\nopened up to moral rationality and altruistic reason. In\r\nthis way it should become possible to have compassion\r\nfor others. Let us have compassion not only for\r\nourselves but also for others. Let us have compassion\r\nfor others within their own idiosyncratic realms.\r\nHaving compassion for others means not coercing them\r\nto assimilate to us or to succumb to our values.\r\nCompassion should come unconditionally. The only\r\ncondition is a mutual agreement to refrain from atrocity\r\nand violence.\r\nLet us welcome any plea to refrain from violence\r\nand to embrace compassion. Let us welcome any call\r\nthat prefers the voice of humanity over the noise of\r\nexplosions. Let us welcome any party that invites us\r\nnot to racism but to respect for the human race. Let us\r\nrespect the fundamental right of all parties to exist.\r\nMoral rationality, heartfelt compassion for others\r\nand the ability to share in both the sufferings and the\r\nhappiness of other people have so far managed to\r\nsustain our world. Let us breathe into the solemn and\r\ndry body of politics the soul of morality and ethics,\r\nthereby making it humane. When it comes to enmity\r\nand revenge, let us be as inclined to remember as a\r\nmirror. A tall, clean, truthful mirror can reflect to\r\ninfinity our own beauties and those of others. It is\r\nunwise to shatter the mirror.\r\nMr. Schüssel (Austria): Please allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election and\r\nthank you for the leadership with which you are\r\nguiding this Assembly at a time of unprecedented\r\nchallenges to the United Nations and its Member\r\nStates. It is a particular honour for me to address the\r\nAssembly on a subject which, I believe, can\r\nsignificantly contribute to helping us find a convincing\r\nresponse to these terrible new challenges.\r\nWhen the President of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran proposed the dialogue among civilizations in\r\n1998, many of us immediately realized the importance\r\nof his initiative. But little did we know how urgent and\r\ntopical this initiative would become within a very short\r\ntime. At the time, most of us probably felt that this\r\nwould be a longer-term exercise to bridge a gap that\r\nwas becoming obvious as international leaders and\r\nacademics were struggling to come to terms with a new\r\nset of paradigms for international relations in the post-\r\ncold-war period. While some believed in a model of\r\nclashing civilizations dividing the world along fault\r\nlines of religion and culture, others shared the view\r\nthat globalization would erode the remaining\r\ndifferences between societies and lead to one global\r\ncivilization.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September, which took\r\nplace in this remarkable city — the main Headquarters\r\nof the United Nations and often referred to as the hub\r\nof the world — stress the need to think beyond the\r\ntraditional patterns of diplomacy. Faced with an enemy\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\ncompletely disregarding human values and clearly\r\nmisusing religion to justify the unjustifiable, we must\r\nalso think — and act — beyond our current efforts to\r\nbring the terrorists to justice. We need to accentuate\r\nmore clearly our common values, the fundamental\r\nprinciples laid down in the Charter of the United\r\nNations and in the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. We need to build upon these values a world of\r\ntolerance and mutual respect which, I hope, will\r\neventually bring about peace and security and a\r\ngenuine human rights culture in which the value and\r\nsecurity of every human being are respected.\r\nI remember well hearing the Secretary-General\r\nsay, at a recent conference we organized in Salzburg,\r\nthat for the first time in human history the values of\r\nhuman rights and democracy are globally accepted.\r\nToday, I speak here as a European, as a Christian.\r\nI speak from my specific cultural background, as a\r\nconcerned individual.\r\nIn these days, we are called upon to examine the\r\nvalue of the dialogue in our fight against terrorism:\r\ndialogue is the antithesis of hate and intolerance. It is\r\nmy firm conviction that we can and shall use the\r\nDialogue among Civilizations as a preventive tool\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nFrom the very outset, Austria warmly welcomed\r\nand supported the initiative to declare 2001 the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. We\r\nhosted in Vienna the inaugural meeting of the Group of\r\nEminent Persons established by the Secretary-General.\r\nIn August this year, we held the Salzburg\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, and I had the pleasure to\r\ndiscuss with the Secretary-General and many other\r\nparticipants the role of the dialogue as a new paradigm\r\nof international relations.\r\nAustria, a small country, has a long-standing\r\ntradition of promoting open and inclusive dialogue\r\nbetween religions. In the early 1990s, the Vienna\r\nDialogue between Christianity and Islam was initiated,\r\nand many conferences were held. This initiative will\r\ncontinue next February with the Vienna Christian-\r\nIslamic Round Table.\r\nToday, at the peak of the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, it is my pleasure to\r\nexpress my sincere gratitude to all those who have so\r\nactively contributed to its success — in particular to\r\nthe Secretary-General, but also to his Personal\r\nRepresentative, Mr. Giandomenico Picco, and to the\r\nEminent Persons who authored the book Crossing the\r\nDivide, which we have just received.\r\nWhere do we go from here? The dialogue should\r\nbe a dialogue between, as well as within, civilizations\r\nand societies. Its aim is better understanding, tolerance\r\nand respect for different opinions.\r\nThe principle of justice, for example, is a\r\ncentrepiece of both the Bible and the Koran. Holy\r\nscriptures have played an essential role in the history of\r\nmankind for overcoming cases of injustice. In fact, one\r\nmight argue that believing in God remains an empty\r\nphrase or even a blasphemy unless it includes the\r\nunshakeable insistence on justice, reconciliation and\r\npeace.\r\nAt a global level, justice must be a central aim\r\nboth in the relationships among sovereign States and\r\namong individuals.\r\nCan we close our eyes before the screaming\r\ninjustice that in some parts of the world not even the\r\nmost basic medical care is available, while in other\r\nparts fortunes are irresponsibly spent for marginal\r\ngains? Can we avoid the question of how to reach a\r\nfairer, more equal distribution of resources and chances\r\nin a globalized economy? Can we remain indifferent\r\nwhen confronted with the lack of hope and perspective\r\non the part of the younger generation in many parts of\r\nthe world, as a result of insufficient education and\r\nunemployment?\r\nIn order to reach all segments of society, we also\r\nhave to make the dialogue more broad-based. In\r\nparticular, we will have to aim for the children — our\r\nfuture. Boys and girls alike need a good education that\r\nteaches them the merits of mutual respect and\r\nsolidarity. They should be able to grow up with a\r\nprofound understanding of, and esteem for, diversity\r\nand plurality.\r\nWe also have to ensure greater involvement in the\r\ndialogue on the part of civil society and of the media.\r\nAs a contribution, next year we will hold a seminar in\r\nVienna on dialogue among civilizations and the role of\r\nthe media.\r\nActs of violence, ethnic cleansing and terrorism\r\nare often rooted in the perception of diversity as a\r\nthreat. That is why we must go beyond diplomatic\r\ncircles and expert meetings and reach out to the hearts\r\nand minds of people, particularly young people, all\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nover the world. Let us use globalization to create a new\r\nawareness of togetherness and closeness among people.\r\nCultural diversity — far from being a threat — is\r\nenriching, both for individuals and for societies.\r\nNumerous examples throughout the centuries have\r\nproved that cultural exchange is beneficial for all\r\ninvolved. All of our civilizations are, in fact, the\r\nproducts of centuries of cultural interaction, and all\r\ncivilizations continue to be influenced by each other.\r\nCivilizations are dynamic rather than static or\r\nmonolithic entities.\r\nUniversality should not be mistaken for\r\nuniformity. Where uniformity denies diversity,\r\nuniversality is necessarily inclusive. This very\r\nforum — the United Nations — is built on universality\r\nand on diversity. Universality is no danger to cultural\r\nidentity. On the contrary, the recognition of, and\r\nrespect for, plurality is part of the universality that\r\nbinds us together. It enables us to recognize differences\r\nand to consciously remove barriers. If focuses our\r\nminds on what is common to humanity — our shared\r\nvalues, which are embraced by different religions and\r\nsocieties.\r\nUnity in diversity must be based on mutual\r\nrespect, which transcends mere tolerance. As President\r\nKhatami so rightly stated in 1999 at the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO),\r\n“If this dialogue is to truly open a new\r\nchapter in global international relations, it has to\r\nadvance from a phase of passive tolerance to a\r\nphase of mutual assistance.”\r\nLearning from others deepens our self-\r\nrecognition. The famous Islamic teacher Iqbal knew —\r\nas did Goethe, the European poet and thinker — that\r\ndialogue does not mean assimilation but recognition\r\nand acceptance of differences, respect of diversity, and\r\ncreativity in their selection.\r\nIn our societies, we are often victims of negative\r\nstereotypes. Too often, these stereotypes are misused to\r\ncreate so-called feindbilder, a German word that means\r\n“images of enemies”, in order to stabilize societies or\r\npolitical power bases. What we need, on the contrary,\r\nare positive images of neighbourhood and partnership.\r\nIn a globalized world, on this common planet, we need\r\nto reduce negative images and energy and put our\r\ncreativity to work so that we can appreciate one\r\nanother.\r\nLet us dismantle our images of confrontation. Let\r\nus carry out the strenuous task of listening, getting in\r\ntouch with each other and learning from one another.\r\nLet us first start with honest questions, not with instant\r\nanswers. Let us delve into the depths rather than\r\nremain on the surface of zeitgeist debates.\r\nThe Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schönborn once\r\nsaid:\r\n“In an increasingly complex world,\r\nindividual conscience is ever more important. We\r\nhave to sharpen our conscience and learn to listen\r\nto its voice carefully. Doomed are the people and\r\nthe country where the voice of conscience is\r\ncrushed.”\r\nLearning from each other means abandoning the\r\nidea of a single truth. Truth can never be claimed as the\r\nproperty of any specific culture or civilization. We can\r\nonly endeavour to search for truth together — patiently\r\nand persistently.\r\nIn order to become part of global solutions\r\nourselves, let us start with small but concrete steps. Let\r\nus take a bottom-up rather than top-down approach.\r\nCultural dialogue is one instrument that could\r\nhelp achieve this, through the creation of intercultural\r\nnetworks for religious, economic and ecological\r\nexchanges. Let us better appreciate the value of\r\nminorities. Let us defend them and actively work\r\nagainst their alienation and isolation. Let us also try to\r\nwin over international media in our effort towards\r\nsolidarity and tolerance, and let us invite religious\r\nleaders to join in a dialogue, especially those who are\r\nstill sceptical or reluctant. We need visible symbols and\r\npersonalities in the quest for global solidarity and\r\ncompassion.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations will lack\r\ncredibility and conviction unless women from all\r\ncultures and traditions fully participate in their\r\nsocieties and in the global community. Their\r\nexperiences, aspirations and dreams must become part\r\nand parcel of our dialogue.\r\nThe pre-eminent place for dialogue remains, of\r\ncourse, our United Nations itself. But we know that\r\ndialogue is not possible between institutions; only\r\nhuman beings can enter into a dialogue with readiness\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nand openness, talking not so much about others but\r\nabout themselves.\r\nAt the meeting on the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations held last autumn here in New York,\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan said:\r\n“Without this dialogue taking place every\r\nday among all nations — within and between\r\ncivilizations, cultures and groups — no peace can\r\nbe lasting and no prosperity can be secure.”\r\n(SG/SM/7526)\r\nThis has never been never more true. It also\r\nillustrates why the United Nations and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral received this year’s Nobel Peace Price, and I\r\nwholeheartedly extend my congratulations once again.\r\nMuch has been said about globalization and\r\nfragmentation in a world that is still unsettled after the\r\nend of the stable but stifling bipolar model of the\r\nsecond half of the last century. We have seen terrible\r\nconflicts based on ethnic and religious differences, and\r\nwe have been helpless in the face of hate on the part of\r\nthe other, which, because of its inherent irrationality,\r\ndefies all rational efforts at conflict resolution.\r\nTo my mind, the heart of dialogue consists of\r\ntolerance and acceptance of our respective otherness —\r\nnot back to back, but face to face.\r\nHowever, dialogue, cooperation and\r\nunderstanding also entail joint intolerance of that\r\nwhich is intolerable. We may argue endlessly about\r\nwhat constitutes a civilization; however, there must not\r\nbe any doubt that universal rules and principles apply\r\neverywhere. There can be no tolerance and no\r\nunderstanding for those who attack humanity, and there\r\nwill be no place for them to hide.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations is probably one\r\nof the most forward-looking initiatives of the final\r\nyears of the violent twentieth century. It will be up to\r\nus to make wise use of its potential in order to make\r\nthe twenty-first century an era of openness rather than\r\nwithdrawal, of respect rather than rejection, and of\r\ntogetherness rather than alienation.\r\nMr. Lagumdzija (Bosnia and Herzegovina):\r\nComing from Bosnia and Herzegovina, a European\r\ncountry that survived an experiment planned to be a\r\nclash of civilizations at the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury — it is a special pleasure for me to join you\r\ntoday at the United Nations to contribute to a global\r\nagenda for dialogue among civilizations.\r\nLess than 10 years ago, terrorists tried to exploit\r\nreligion and ethnic identity in order to widen the gap,\r\nor build a wall, between “us” and “them”, between\r\npeople whom they considered to be guilty because they\r\nwere somehow different. For years the international\r\ncommunity remained neutral, staying between the local\r\narmed forces and trying to protect civilians as much as\r\nthey were allowed to, but without interfering in the\r\nwar.\r\nAt that time, Slobodan Milosevic was bombing\r\nDubrovnik, a medieval jewel on the Adriatic coast,\r\nkilling mostly Catholics. Meanwhile, his key\r\nhenchmen, Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko\r\nMladic, who are under indictment today for war\r\ncrimes, were keeping Sarajevo besieged and explaining\r\nthat, by doing so, they were protecting Christianity\r\nfrom Islam in the heart of Europe. No one called them\r\nOrthodox terrorists. They were simply among the\r\nterrorists who later ended up as war criminals. But\r\nwhen the world united to stop the war, the war ended.\r\nToday, another group of people acting on behalf\r\nof Islam in another part of the world are exploiting\r\nreligion in order to impose their values by terror and\r\ncrime. Every Bosnian, Muslim and non-Muslim,\r\nsharing each other’s heritage, knows very well the\r\nsaying from the Holy Qur’an (S.5, A.32)\r\n“That if anyone slew\r\nA person ...\r\nIt would be as if\r\nHe slew the whole people.”\r\nSolidarity and justice are two very fundamental values\r\nthat we all believe in, and under which we want to live.\r\nWe have to use the tragedy of 11 September\r\n2001 — which was not only a tragedy for America, but\r\nalso a tragedy for all humankind — as an opportunity\r\nto wake up and strike at the very roots of global\r\nterrorism — to strike at selfishness and isolationism\r\nand at injustice and poverty with new, wider initiatives\r\nand agendas. The time has come to have statehood for\r\nPalestinians and security for Israelis. Dialogue among\r\ncivilizations on the local and global levels is the only\r\nway to exterminate terrorism.\r\nComing from Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Balkan\r\ncountry that has experienced a different kind of\r\nfundamentalism and faces the problems because of its\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nmulti-ethnic, multicultural and multi-religious nature, I\r\nam especially sensitive to terrorism that exploits\r\nreligious feelings and, by so doing, puts local and\r\nglobal society in jeopardy. For 10 years during the war\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, and during the initial years\r\nof peace-building and reconstruction of the country, we\r\nwitnessed how terrorism, religious fundamentalism,\r\nnationalism and segregation led to nothing but war\r\ncriminals, organized crime, poverty and injustice. The\r\nfight that we are leading today is a fight against the\r\nconsequences of poverty, ignorance and injustice.\r\nThere is a much bigger task expected of us: to\r\nuproot the causes and eliminate the potential focal\r\npoints of new extremism. Thus we have to support\r\nactions targeted against terrorists, but at the same time\r\nbe more vocal and more action-oriented when we call\r\nfor quick and massive help for the people of\r\nAfghanistan and other related areas with all sorts of\r\nhumanitarian needs. The war against terrorists is\r\njustified, but all of us will be losers if we fail to do\r\neverything we can to help innocent people who are\r\nsuffering today.\r\nI am saying this because I know from my own\r\nexperience what all this means. After surviving four\r\nyears of war and 12 difficult surgeries because of being\r\nseverely wounded — though a civilian — in my home\r\ncity of Sarajevo, I do not hate anyone. I am only\r\ngrateful to the people who gave me an opportunity to\r\nsurvive. After personally visiting four capitals in the\r\nlast three weeks and talking to key European leaders, I\r\nam taking the floor here today not to say or ask but —\r\nif I may speak metaphorically — to scream to and to\r\nbeg the Assembly to speed up all kinds of humanitarian\r\nhelp to innocent people who are the victims of their\r\nown leadership.\r\nOne more dollar, yen or euro that is spent one\r\nhour sooner can save some little child who may one\r\nday come to this building as a new leader of\r\nAfghanistan to speak on behalf of his proud country —\r\nsomeone like the great scientist and reformer Jamal\r\nAl-Deen Al-Afghani, who, I am sure, would today\r\npromote priorities such as education, freedom,\r\ninformation technologies and the rule of law instead of\r\nall the kinds of prohibitions imposed by the Taliban.\r\nBut it has to be clearly seen that, whatever happens,\r\nthis is not a war of civilizations. It is a war between\r\ncivilization and open society, on the one side, and\r\nterrorism and tribalism, on the other.\r\nThe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina —\r\nBosniacs, Croats and Serbs, Muslims, Catholics and\r\nOrthodox — are all united, having chosen together to\r\nbe on the side of civilization and an open society. We\r\nchose to be on the side of dialogue, not on the side of\r\ndivision among civilizations. Our only goal is a multi-\r\nreligious multi-ethnic, open society, a Bosnia\r\nHerzegovina that is an economically sustainable,\r\ndemocratic State, a natural and integral part of a\r\ndemocratic and socially just Europe and world.\r\nThis war, a war for civilization and an open\r\nsociety and for the right to be different and to be\r\nprotected by the rule of law, cannot be won without a\r\nnew generation of creative and credible leaders, who\r\nprove their courage by words and deeds in my country,\r\nin Europe and in the world. Let me outline some of the\r\nlessons we have learned in the hardest way — from our\r\nown experience.\r\nFirst, when you are confronted with the dilemma\r\nof dialogue or division, recognize the dilemma: are you\r\ngoing to build peace or start a war?\r\nSecondly, “our” enemy is not “they” ─ nations,\r\nreligions, cultures or races. All of us have a common\r\nenemy: poverty and injustice.\r\nThirdly, if you want to defend yourself and be left\r\nin peace, it’s not a question of being able to defend\r\nyourself, but of being able to defend people around you\r\nfrom yourself.\r\nFourthly, a civilization confronted with terrorism\r\nhas no choice. Terrorism and crime have no religion,\r\nethnicity or civilization. Terrorism is the one that\r\nchooses war, and civilization has to go into it in order\r\nto survive. But civilization has a choice: to save its\r\nown soul by helping civilians, using as many resources\r\nas it can to strike at terrorism with legitimate force and\r\nmilitary action.\r\nFifthly, you can defeat terrorists and war\r\ncriminals only with force. People like Karadzic or bin\r\nLaden have to be brought to justice. But you cannot\r\nbuild with force. The peace-building process can be\r\nmade successful only by investing massively in\r\neducation, building up the institutions of the State,\r\nstrengthening the economy and ruling by the rule of\r\nlaw, not by the rule of the rulers.\r\nSixthly, leaders demonstrate courage when they\r\nsign peace agreements. People can make peace only if\r\ntheir leaders show creativity while leading credibly by\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\ntheir own example and communicating their vision to\r\ntheir network of followers who, under that skilful\r\nleadership, manage changes in their respective areas of\r\nexpertise.\r\nSeventhly, dialogue cannot be only in words; it\r\nmust be in deeds as well, through the five dimensions\r\nof the new era: education, ecumenism, environmental\r\nresponsibility, economy and electronic media.\r\nFinally, allow me to share one powerful learning\r\nexperience with you, which is a clear example of\r\npeople’s needs, tragedies and dreams today. Almost 10\r\nyears ago, when the siege of the city of Sarajevo\r\nstarted, we were all shocked by a live television story\r\nabout a man in a hospital holding his five-year-old\r\ndaughter, who had been hit in the head by a sniper\r\nwhile playing in the backyard with her friends. Her\r\nonly crime was that she was one of “them”, that she\r\nbelonged to — as the killer would probably say — the\r\nwrong ethnicity or religion.\r\nThe father was holding his daughter in his arms\r\nwhen a journalist asked him: “What would you do to\r\nthe man who shot your daughter?” Hugging the child,\r\nhe responded,\r\n“Nothing, I would like to have coffee with him\r\nand to tell him: ‘Congratulations, now you made\r\nit. You hit a child, hero.’ I only hope that her\r\ntears will follow him all his life.”\r\nSome time ago I saw that same man being asked\r\nby the same journalist: “Now that the war is over,\r\nwould you want real punishment for the sniper shooter?\r\nHave you changed your mind?” The answer was clear:\r\n“I do not”. He continued:\r\n“Thanks to Almighty God, my daughter\r\nrecovered by a miracle. A son was born in the\r\nmeantime, who was also wounded by shrapnel,\r\nbut he is in good health now as well. My house\r\nwas destroyed. I have no job, but today the only\r\nthing I want is to work, to rebuild my house, to\r\nprovide my kids with a chance to become\r\neducated, to be healthy, to grow up and to love\r\ngood people. I do not want anyone to experience\r\nwhat I did. Nothing is worth a child’s tears.”\r\nI am absolutely sure that there can be no reason\r\nfor even one child’s tears. This is why we need a new\r\ngeneration of leaders, to be different from and better\r\nthan today’s leaders. The new generations have to live\r\nand grow in a different environment. Our duty is to\r\ngive them a fair opportunity to create a set of values\r\nthat will help us envision a world in which there will\r\nbe fewer children’s tears than there are today.\r\nI am sure that the great number of States and\r\norganizations represented here today came to show\r\ntheir commitment to a dialogue of words and deeds that\r\ncan realize our vision of civilizations living in\r\nharmony, instead of the nightmare of the clash among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nI am offering you my country as a place, as a\r\ncase, as a forum in which dialogue won over division. I\r\nam calling on members to come look at us and see, on\r\na small scale, what the future of civilizations looks\r\nlike. So far, Bosnia and Herzegovina has proved to be\r\nthe place that rendered the notion of a clash of\r\ncivilizations null and void and now is on its way to\r\nbecoming proof that democracy, freedom and respect\r\nof human rights are universal.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe Central and Eastern Europe countries associated\r\nwith the European Union — the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia — and the associated countries Cyprus,\r\nMalta and Turkey align themselves with this statement.\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election and on the skill with\r\nwhich you have led this session in particularly difficult\r\ncircumstances.\r\nWhen we decided to declare 2001 the United\r\nNations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations we\r\ncould not have foreseen that this year would remain in\r\npeoples’ memories primarily as that of the war against\r\nterrorism, a kind of terrorism suddenly emerging as one\r\nof the major challenges in a globalized world. Those\r\nwho organized the monstrous attacks of 11 September\r\nmade a deliberate attempt to spread hatred among\r\npeoples and provoke a clash between religions and\r\ncultures.\r\nTheir hope is undoubtedly to provoke that much-\r\npublicized clash between civilizations that was\r\npredicted at the end of the cold war. Our debate today\r\nshould provide further proof that their actions had the\r\nopposite effect of what they had hoped for. The\r\noverwhelming majority of States represented here have\r\ncondemned them unreservedly. We have closed ranks;\r\nwe have expressed our solidarity with the United\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nStates. We have recognized that a legitimate response\r\nwas necessary, and we have cooperated in setting up an\r\narsenal of measures at the global level to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe must also — and today’s debate provides the\r\nideal opportunity to do this — try to build some\r\nfoundations for what will doubtless be one of the main\r\nprojects of the century that has begun: the dialogue\r\namong civilizations, which includes and respects the\r\nplurality and the diversity of cultures, to bring them\r\ntogether and strengthen them and to expand and\r\nstrengthen the common bases of universal values.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment identified freedom, equality, solidarity,\r\ntolerance, respect for nature and the sharing of\r\nresponsibilities as fundamental values. Therefore, I\r\nwould like to thank President Khatami, who was\r\nbehind this initiative, and the Secretary-General for his\r\npersonal attention to this project.\r\nThe tragedy of 11 September, as we all witnessed\r\nso vividly, produced a shock wave throughout the\r\nworld, the breadth of which led us naturally to look\r\ninto its root causes. As their perpetrators have referred\r\nto Islam to justify their acts, some people have seen in\r\nthese events the beginning of an era ripped apart by\r\nviolent, passionate and radical confrontation between\r\ncivilizations.\r\nWe wish to condemn outright this talk of division\r\nand fear. For us, the terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nare purely negative and hateful acts directed against all\r\nof us, with no real distinction between civilizations,\r\ncultures and religions. Terrorism is the act of those\r\nminorities who wish to impose their plan through\r\nterror. It is a phenomenon that is by definition\r\nantidemocratic.\r\nBut it is not enough to reject this talk and these\r\nacts. We must oppose them with action based on a\r\ndynamic approach of the modern world and a firmly\r\npositive conviction of the universal rules of the society\r\nthat we wish to establish: rules that assure and\r\nguarantee respect for differences, tolerance, dialogue\r\nand respect for others. This fight for the human person\r\ncompels us to promote our common and shared values\r\nas a whole. That responds to the spirit of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s speech on the dialogue among civilizations at\r\nSalzburg on 28 August 2001.\r\nIn that context, it seems to me that we must avoid\r\ntwo dangers. This must be stressed so that there is\r\nnever confusion between the fight against terrorism and\r\nthe disloyal fight against some disturbed elements of\r\nthe opposition. That danger really exists. It is also\r\nnecessary to take measures so that the fight against\r\nterrorism does not affect the level of demand and the\r\ndemocratic nature of our societies.\r\nWe must emphasize here that our shared, common\r\nvalues have developed over the course of history.\r\nHumanity has developed its ethical traditions in the\r\nconviction that human beings are endowed with reason\r\nand a moral conscience and that they should treat each\r\nother in a fraternal spirit. It is this search for common\r\nmoral and ethical values that has led to the codification\r\nof universal legal standards, which set out today the\r\nuniversal rights designed to protect the dignity of every\r\nhuman being. The United Nations Charter contains a\r\nset of values and principles that unite the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThis debate, devoted to the United Nations Year\r\nof Dialogue among Civilizations, gives each of us the\r\nopportunity to ask ourselves questions. Have we\r\nremained faithful to our own cultures and to their\r\nunderlying values? Has our Western culture been\r\naggressive or at times too dominant because the great\r\nmajority of mankind sees it close up but does not have\r\naccess to it? Have not the great cultural debates\r\nsometimes appeared as discussions of rich,\r\nethnocentric people who did not understand or who\r\nignored the political, economic, social, cultural and\r\nspiritual realities of anything outside the Western\r\nworld?\r\nThe only real answer is clearly dialogue, and\r\ntoday it is a dialogue of cultures, a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations, which cannot be reduced to a dialogue\r\namong religions. What are the principles underlying a\r\ntrue dialogue of cultures? First of all, it is the equal\r\ndignity of all cultures and their ability to interpenetrate\r\nand enrich each other in a spirit of tolerance and\r\nmutual respect. The other founding principle, it seems\r\nto me, is the need for cultural diversity — the right to\r\ndifference and identity. This principle is inseparable\r\nfrom the principle that all cultures have equal dignity.\r\nIt is from this perspective that the European\r\nUnion sees dialogue among civilizations. But there\r\nshould be no taboos. We are duty-bound to ask\r\nquestions of our own civilization, and we also have the\r\nright to ask questions of others. But others also have\r\nthe right to question us on our civilization and as to\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nwhy, for example, certain inequalities exist. If the\r\ndialogue among civilizations were reduced to meeting\r\nto congratulate one another, this would obviously not\r\nbe a dialogue.\r\nWe need to ask ourselves about the link between\r\nculture and politics. Pretentious exaltation and intense\r\ncultural preferences can lead to nationalisms of\r\nexclusion and rejection. It would be good to recall that\r\nwhile we favour equality of cultures, the culture in\r\nquestion should not be based on identifying signs or\r\ncharacteristics totally incompatible with human dignity\r\nor the principles and values that make up our common\r\ncommitment to humanism, the rule of law and respect\r\nfor the dignity of others. Having said this, we need to\r\nstress the importance, for example, of questioning the\r\nlinks between religion and politics.\r\nThe community of nations needs a frank,\r\nrevitalised, renewed and reinvented dialogue in touch\r\nwith what is going on in the world. It needs a real\r\ndialogue among civilizations that strengthens\r\ntraditional diplomacy in its role of pursuing ideas and\r\nconsensuses and thus helps the United Nations in its\r\ntask of bringing peoples together and fighting all forms\r\nof exclusion. This is the only way that we will create a\r\ncommon basis of shared fundamental values for all\r\ncivilizations.\r\nThis dialogue of peoples and cultures means both\r\nrespect for others and self-respect. Respecting others is\r\nfirst of all wanting to get to know them. This requires\r\nan open mind, trust, imagination, a rejection of\r\ncomplacency, moral strength and firmness to resist\r\nanything that could imperil freedom and individual\r\nrights. No value is the exclusive prerogative of one\r\ngroup, people or culture.\r\nWanting to know others is also and above all an\r\nattempt to know oneself. The dialogue of cultures must\r\nbe carried on with lucidity and also humility. All of us\r\nmust examine our own cultures in a spirit of openness\r\nand make sure that the dialogue is fruitful. Self-respect\r\nis another key element. We must be sure of our own\r\nvalues and ideals in order to start a rich and\r\nconstructive dialogue. We should also, I think, base\r\nsuch an approach on the conviction that one culture —\r\neven if it is founded on intangible ideas — is never a\r\nprocess that is fully completed; on the contrary, it can\r\nsurvive only if it is dynamic and continues to evolve.\r\nIn the United Nations system, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) is called upon to play a special role in\r\ndeveloping the dialogue among cultures. As UNESCO\r\nhas reminded us, one of the major aims of the dialogue\r\namong civilizations is to increase and spread\r\nknowledge and appreciation of the historic and cultural\r\nbases of societies all over the world. The European\r\nUnion welcomes the adoption a few days ago, at the\r\nthirty-first General Conference of UNESCO, of a\r\ndeclaration on cultural diversity, which opens the way\r\nto promotion of these principles.\r\nThe aim of the dialogue among civilizations\r\nshould be to include and integrate. As the World\r\nProgramme for Dialogue among Civilizations\r\nproposes, a major objective will be to promote the\r\ninclusion of all people, fairness, equality, justice and\r\ntolerance in human interactions. Cultures are different\r\nand these differences can never make them superior or\r\ninferior to one another. Cultural pluralism and diversity\r\nare a source of wealth and a priceless heritage for\r\nhumankind. The best way to promote mutual\r\nunderstanding and to combat the scourge of intolerance\r\nis dialogue.\r\nCultural diversity is at the very heart of the\r\nfounding vision of the European Union. The Treaty of\r\nRome establishing the European Community stipulates\r\nthat:\r\n“The Community shall contribute to the\r\nflowering of the cultures of the Member States,\r\nwhile respecting their national and regional\r\ndiversity and at the same time bringing the\r\ncommon cultural heritage to the fore.”\r\nImproving knowledge and the disseminating the culture\r\nof European peoples was emphasized from the very\r\nbeginning of European unification.\r\nIn its relations with third parties, the European\r\nUnion is also committed to the promotion of universal\r\nvalues such as human rights or principles underlying\r\ndemocratic rule of law. The European Union attaches\r\ngreat importance to the promotion, by its member\r\nStates and by civil society and the individuals that\r\nmake it up, of respect for the intrinsic dignity of human\r\nbeings and for their rights. We are convinced that\r\npromoting these values goes hand in hand with the\r\ndialogue among cultures and can only enrich and\r\nstrengthen it. In this connection, the European Union\r\nwishes to affirm the existence of a universal ethic,\r\nespecially the one that inspired the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. This ethic belongs to all\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\npeoples, all nations and all religions. To affirm this\r\nuniversality is to underline the solidarity that links all\r\nhuman beings.\r\nA true dialogue among civilizations will help to\r\nreinforce this universal awareness, while rejecting a\r\ncultural relativism that would be tantamount to denying\r\nboth diversity and shared values.\r\nThe European Union has followed with great\r\ninterest the work done by the group of eminent persons\r\ndesignated by the Secretary-General to lead the talks\r\non the prospects of a dialogue among civilizations. Led\r\nby his Personal Representative, Mr. Giandomenico\r\nPicco, they have marked out the essential milestones\r\nfor what will be a very long-term project, designed to\r\nconstruct a new paradigm for relations between nations\r\nand cultures. We congratulate the group on the\r\nremarkable contribution it has made, and we are\r\nconfident that it will encourage discussion and\r\nreflection — in other words, dialogue.\r\nThe European Union would like to thank its\r\npartners for the constructive spirit that has prevailed\r\nduring the preparation of the resolution on the draft\r\nGlobal Agenda for Dialogue among Civilizations. We\r\nhope that the implementation of this programme will\r\nreceive the attention that it deserves well beyond this\r\nyear and that this dialogue will be promoted at all\r\nlevels: local, national, regional and international. The\r\nUnion would like to point out here that it has been\r\nconducting an extremely diversified dialogue for a long\r\ntime now with a great many countries and regional\r\ngroups.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations is an innovative\r\nfacet of the permanent dialogue that has been\r\nconducted within the United Nations since it founded.\r\nThe European Union hopes that this tool will reinforce\r\nthe work for peace and bringing peoples together that\r\nthe United Nations has accomplished, work that has\r\nrecently earned it the Nobel Peace Prize. By\r\nparticipating actively, the Union hopes to contribute\r\ntowards the emergence of a more harmonious, tolerant\r\nand just world.\r\nMs. Ratsifandriamanana (Madagascar) (spoke\r\nin French): We are gathered again in the General\r\nAssembly Hall, in the very heart of New York, which is\r\nstill traumatized, as we all are, by the memory of the\r\nmassacre of 11 September. New York is a crossroads of\r\ncultural diversity, a cosmopolitan city where the most\r\nvaried civilizations coexist.\r\nOn behalf of the Madagascar delegation, I wish to\r\nreiterate our words of salutation and homage to you,\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo, President of the fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly, which is full of so many\r\nchallenges and expectations; and to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, who during his term of office led the\r\nMillennium Assembly. We are proud that our\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, was awarded the\r\nNobel Peace Prize he so deserved. That honour\r\nexpressed the confidence of the whole world in our\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe have nearly reached the end of the Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, and we would now like\r\nto take stock of the Year and to outline the way\r\nforward. We are grateful to President Khatami of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran for having taken the initiative.\r\nWe are also grateful to the Personal Representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Giandomenico Picco, for\r\nhis commendable contribution. Several States and\r\ninternational organizations, in particular the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), and several non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and academic institutions\r\nhave come together to make a reality of the noble\r\nresolution 53/22, adopted on 4 November 1998.\r\nMadagascar subscribes to the Millennium\r\nDeclaration’s provisions regarding the aspirations of\r\nthe peoples of the world to work for peace and on\r\ndialogue among civilizations. Madagascar supported\r\nand co-sponsored resolution 55/254, on the protection\r\nof religious sites. My country welcomes the launching\r\nof the book entitled Crossing the Divide: Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations.\r\nFurthermore, we very much appreciate the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations trust fund for the\r\nUnited Nations Year of Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nWe strongly support the recommendations of the\r\nSalzburg meeting, held in August 2001, on dialogue\r\namong civilizations as a new paradigm of international\r\nrelations. Likewise, we enthusiastically welcome the\r\nInternational UNESCO Conference on cultural policy\r\nas a global task.\r\nMadagascar is one of the African countries that\r\ncelebrated the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations. A\r\ndiscussion workshop was organized from 10 to 12\r\nOctober, with the participation of leaders of State and\r\nacademic institutions and civil society, national and\r\ninternational experts, and political and religious\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nleaders. The main themes discussed were the\r\npromotion of diversity, tolerance, interdependence,\r\nrethinking the concepts of enemy and defence at the\r\ndawn of the third millennium, identifying the\r\nresponsibility of international political actors and\r\nthinking about dialogue and poverty eradication. It is a\r\npleasure for me to share with the Assembly the main\r\npoints that emerged from that gathering.\r\nThe first point is the use of dialogue in order to\r\nrethink the concept of enemy. Enemy today has a\r\nglobal, international and collective character. A global\r\nenemy can be, for example, poverty, AIDS, terrorism\r\nor global warming. An international enemy attacks all\r\ncountries, rich and poor, without discrimination. It can\r\nbe a collective enemy, because no country can remain\r\nindifferent to it, and our struggle against it becomes a\r\njoint struggle. Our response also has to be global,\r\ninternational and collective, based on an awareness of\r\nthe interdependence of nations, the need for\r\ninternational solidarity and the urgent need for an\r\nongoing multidirectional dialogue. Clearly, a new\r\ndefence strategy resulting from global dialogue must be\r\nworked out under the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nIn order to make the enemy an adversary, let us\r\nfirst create circumstances conducive to an exchange of\r\nideas and to mutual understanding. Then, to make the\r\nadversary a partner, let us establish a climate of\r\ncooperation in order to provide a common framework\r\nfor action. Finally, in order to make the partner a\r\nfriend, let us have interactive communication in a\r\nclimate of real trust.\r\nThe second point is to engage in dialogue in order\r\nto promote the well-being of peoples. Dialogue will\r\nbecome an instrument for positive, peaceful and\r\npragmatic action for sustainable human development, a\r\nsupport system for strategies to combat poverty and\r\nscourges of all kinds. Dialogue remains an agent of\r\nreconciliation, opening up, harmony and appreciation\r\nof diversity. Dialogue is a catalyst for cultural\r\nintegration at various levels. Traditional values could\r\nbe reference points for creating a system of behaviour\r\nleading to peace, for strengthening the links among\r\ncountries and for encouraging respect for human rights.\r\nThe third point is to use dialogue as a means of\r\nactive expression. The President of the Republic of\r\nMadagascar, Mr. Didier Ratsiraka, has proposed a non-\r\naggression pact at the national level among the\r\nreligious institutions of our country in order to pre-\r\nempt the risk of a clash of religions or schools of\r\nthought. We must have the courage to denounce the\r\nexcesses of ideological fanaticism and extremism,\r\nwhich do damage to our shared principles. Any\r\ndialogue requires preparation. We must start learning to\r\ndialogue, because there are several ways to dialogue,\r\ndepending on the situations, sensitivities and needs\r\ninvolved.\r\nA universal manual of procedures for conducting\r\ndialogue should be worked out to serve as a common\r\nreference tool or guidepost to avoid awkward\r\ncommunication. The risk of radical reactions could\r\nthus be avoided.\r\nWith regard to the access of developing countries\r\nto new information and communication technologies\r\nand to different linguistic systems, greater support is\r\nrequired on the part of the developed countries in order\r\nto narrow the gap and to overcome the communication\r\ndivide among nations. Mobility programmes for people\r\nfrom one country to another should be extended within\r\nthe United Nations, like those that have already been\r\ninitiated by various regional groups and countries.\r\nThere can be no successful dialogue so long as\r\nthe culture of peace and openness, which is so often\r\nmentioned, remains divorced from daily realities; so\r\nlong as frustrations of all sorts, intolerance and\r\ndestitution persist; and so long as the excellent\r\nresolutions adopted in this Hall are not accompanied by\r\nconcrete action. On the basis of this conviction, we\r\napprove the United Nations programme for the\r\ndialogue among civilizations.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow me\r\nat the outset to extend to you, Sir, my congratulations\r\non your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. We also thank your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his efforts in\r\nmaking the fifty-fifth session a success. We extend our\r\nappreciation to the staff of your office. We are fully\r\nconfident that, with your wisdom and expertise, you\r\nwill lead us to the results to which we all aspire.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the report\r\nof the Secretary-General in document A/56/523, under\r\nagenda item 25, “United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations”. We commend the efforts of\r\nMr. Giandomenico Picco, the personal representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General for the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations. We also commend the\r\nimportant role played by the United Nations\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\r\n(UNESCO) and by other academic and scientific\r\ninstitutions, and we look forward to working further in\r\nthis area and to intensifying our efforts to encourage\r\nexchanges of views and interaction between all sectors\r\nand individuals, Governments, international\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations,\r\nresearchers, thinkers and artists from all cultures and\r\ncivilizations.\r\nIn this regard, we salute the publication of the\r\nbook entitled Crossing the Divide: Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, to which the personal representative of\r\nthe Secretary-General, in cooperation with UNESCO,\r\nand other eminent persons and thinkers from various\r\ncultural backgrounds have contributed. We believe that\r\nthis represents a real beginning in the setting of joint\r\nsolid foundations for an exchange of views and\r\nexpertise to reach a better understanding that will give\r\nus an objective and meaningful dialogue among\r\ncivilizations. We also commend the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran for preparing the draft global agenda for\r\ndialogue among civilizations.\r\nIslam is based on the unity of humankind arising\r\nfrom the roots of belief and from the faith that we all\r\nshare the same origin and that the family of Abraham\r\nincludes all humankind; that common human nature\r\nundoubtedly unifies all cultures and civilizations; and\r\nthat cultural heritages belong to all humankind. On the\r\nbasis of these concepts, human relations are formulated\r\nthrough interaction and positive cooperation to\r\npopulate and develop our planet and to enjoy its fruits\r\nin solidarity and harmony. This demonstrates that all\r\npeople are equal, free and partners. It also leads to\r\npeaceful coexistence and the meeting of civilizations in\r\nwhich pluralism is a source of power. Dialogue is thus\r\nall the more important in promoting human behaviour\r\nthat rejects the standards of materialism and their\r\ninfluence. It also contributes to the creation of common\r\nworking methods; the preservation of traditions and\r\nrespect for the choices of others, thus promoting the\r\nspirit of peaceful coexistence among cultures,\r\ndeepening interaction between them and weakening the\r\ndesire for hegemony and cultural exclusion.\r\nThe dialogue among religions, a very important\r\nmatter in Sudan’s policies in international affairs, has\r\nreached a very advanced stage, as attested to by the\r\ninternational conference on dialogue among religions\r\norganized by Sudan in November 2000, which, because\r\nof its fruitful results, may serve as a model for\r\nreligious leaders, particularly those from the West. The\r\nconference exemplifies efforts made by Sudan that\r\ncould be generally extended to areas of dialogue on the\r\nbasis of specific principles in the search, first, for a\r\njoint language for dialogue and then for mutual\r\nrecognition of the specificities of each culture,\r\nrejecting the legacies of past conflicts, addressing\r\nprimary issues and shunning marginal ones and\r\ndeveloping a clear vision for the future.\r\nSudan submitted a draft resolution to the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Conference held in Havana in April\r\n2001, calling for the establishment of an international\r\nforum for dialogue among cultures, civilizations and\r\nreligions in order to promote peace, security and\r\nstability, lessen the intensity of conflicts and wars\r\nthroughout the world, achieve consensus on a minimal\r\nlevel of mutual respect and exploit this positive\r\natmosphere in service of the international community.\r\nThe Conference accepted this initiative and decided to\r\nengage a dialogue among cultures in addressing\r\ninternational issues. This is a propitious forum for\r\norchestrating a coordinated effort to promote the values\r\nof dialogue.\r\nIn calling for a tolerant and humane world in\r\nwhich the culture of peace prevails, we urge peoples of\r\ndiverse cultures to reject the propagation of erroneous\r\nconcepts that could have very grave consequences, as\r\nsome have predicted, with respect to a possible clash of\r\ncivilizations in which certain cultures consider\r\nthemselves superior to others in terms of race, religion\r\nand thought. Such a catastrophe would be further\r\naggravated if the leaders and eminent persons of those\r\nsocieties were to embrace such claims, the results of\r\nwhich would be disastrous to the stability of\r\nhumankind.\r\nAgreement that there are specific issues that\r\nhighlight the presence of dispute and divergence of\r\nview is the first requirement for the success of any\r\nprocess of dialogue. It is clear that the current clash of\r\ncultures in the international community has come about\r\nbecause certain problems were exacerbated to such an\r\nextent that military confrontation resulted. At other\r\ntimes, such problems might subside and the results\r\nwould be mere statements of concern.\r\nOur main areas of disagreement relate to\r\nimportant issues, the most prominent of which concern\r\nhuman rights, democracy, religion, values, the global\r\neconomy and the culture of gender. These issues need\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nto be addressed with a great deal of transparency;\r\nacculturation is much more important than self-centred\r\ninterest in one’s own culture. This leads us to a number\r\nof conclusions, which we must accept if we are to\r\nengage in fruitful and results-oriented dialogue.\r\nThe erroneous concepts of human rights held by\r\nsome but not by others, and the problems that these\r\nconcepts entail in the international community — this\r\nmeans that we must undertake a dialogue to understand\r\nthe particulars of each culture so as to ensure that there\r\nis no unilateral concept of human rights. There is\r\ndivergence among cultures concerning the concept of\r\ndemocracy. Different cultures agree that the freedom of\r\nthe individual is the basis of political practice; the\r\ndisagreement relates to the degree of this freedom. This\r\ndisagreement requires us to start a real and constructive\r\ndialogue to understand the basis and the dimensions of\r\neach culture so as to prevent conflict and\r\nmisunderstanding. Safeguarding fundamental human\r\nrights, including freedom of expression, freedom of\r\nworship, freedom of belief and freedom of association,\r\nmust be promoted and placed in the appropriate context\r\nin conformity with international covenants. We would\r\nlike to refer here to the Millennium Declaration, which\r\naffirms the importance of fundamental principles on\r\nwhich international relations should be based.\r\nWe should all note the importance of spirituality\r\nin establishing noble values and in affirming that\r\nfreedom of belief and of worship should not be a\r\nmatter of dispute or of conflict among civilizations. In\r\nthis context we value the daring initiative taken by\r\nPrince Charles to cross the divide between Islamic and\r\nWestern cultures on the basis of his understanding of\r\nthe importance of dialogue in dispelling tendencies\r\ntowards intolerance.\r\nThe economic concept of globalization has\r\nbecome a reality from which there is no escape. The\r\ndeveloped countries have coped with the requirements\r\nof globalization, but the developing and the least\r\ndeveloped countries have not done so. An economic\r\ndialogue of civilizations should therefore begin by\r\nexploring the unjust disparities between rich and poor\r\nthroughout the world, inasmuch as 20 per cent of the\r\npopulation of the world owns 80 per cent of its wealth.\r\nDialogue should explore areas for possible\r\ncooperation in order to reduce the distance between the\r\ntwo worlds. It is clear that the rich world has not\r\nfulfilled its responsibilities, given the poverty, disease\r\nand ignorance from which the poor world is still\r\nsuffering. The impact of poverty cuts across the\r\nboundaries of the rich nations; the whole world has\r\nbecome subject to the two forces of influencing and\r\nbeing influenced; it is a world that is becoming smaller\r\nand smaller every day.\r\nIn this context, the debt burden is a terrible\r\nnightmare. In addition to reflecting the injustices of the\r\nrich and the complaints of the poor, it embodies a\r\nstructural imbalance in the global economic system. In\r\nthe dialogue on the debt burden, therefore, we should\r\ngo beyond debt cancellation and rescheduling and take\r\na daring step forward on the basis of a just partnership\r\nfor development, preserving the rights of creditors\r\nwhile allowing the debtor countries not merely to pay\r\noff their debts but also to make active investments.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September and the current\r\ninternational situation makes the idea of dialogue\r\namong cultures and civilizations a priority. Were it not\r\nfor the determination of some rational people not to\r\nlink Islam to these events, the biased mass media\r\ncoverage would have led to a catastrophe that would\r\nhave had negative repercussions on the idea of\r\ndialogue among civilizations. These tragic events serve\r\nas a starting-point for an open, fruitful and constructive\r\ndialogue among civilizations. These tragic events serve\r\nas a starting point for a fruitful dialogue between\r\ncivilizations for the benefit of the whole of humanity.\r\nA religion such as Islam that calls upon the\r\nfaithful to believe in all heavenly messengers and holy\r\nscriptures cannot be called intolerant. A religion that\r\ncalls upon believers to salute peacefully people whom\r\nthey know or do not know, and to provide refuge to\r\nanybody who asks, whatever the hostility and\r\ndifferences between them, cannot be described as a\r\nreligion of terrorism. A religion that sends people to\r\nhell because they have not fed a pet, and to heaven for\r\ngiving a drink to a thirsty dog, cannot be considered a\r\nreligion that violates human rights. A religion that calls\r\nupon believers to show the right path of God with\r\nwisdom and good advice cannot be called intolerant or\r\nseen as rejecting dialogue.\r\nDespite the tragic events and the conflicts that the\r\nworld has witnessed since the beginning of history, we,\r\nas human beings at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, must call for tolerance, non-violence and\r\ncoexistence in peace and security. The world today has\r\nbenefited from amazing developments in the economic\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nand industrial spheres; it has become a small global\r\nvillage as a result of the advance of science and\r\ntechnology. We should mobilize all these benefits so as\r\nto ensure constructive interaction between different\r\ncultures, with all their different religions and beliefs —\r\nwhatever their manifestations — thereby embodying\r\nthe lofty purposes and principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, which calls for justice, social\r\ndevelopment and tolerance and for peace and good\r\nneighbourly-relations.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation has sponsored the\r\ndraft resolution “Global agenda for dialogue among\r\ncivilizations” — a basic building block for very\r\nimportant work for the benefit of humanity. This will\r\nrequire all delegations to make an effort to ensure a\r\nfirm basis for a new world of harmony, peace, justice,\r\ntolerance, brotherliness and equality.\r\nMr. Rojas López (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me to begin by congratulating\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his Personal\r\nRepresentative for the United Nations International\r\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations,\r\nMr. Giandomenico Picco, on their excellent work to\r\norganize this dialogue. I also wish to thank the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran for its tireless commitment to, and\r\ninterest in, this subject. Likewise, I would like to\r\nexpress my gratitude to the Group of Eminent Persons\r\nfor its valuable work to establish the conceptual basis\r\nof this meeting.\r\nThe General Assembly’s initiative to proclaim\r\nthis year the International Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations is unquestionably one of the most\r\nimportant acts undertaken by the Organization to\r\nachieve peace in the world. Dialogue is undoubtedly\r\nthe best way for us to understand one another. In a\r\nworld with a variety of cultures and beliefs, it is\r\ndialogue that makes it possible to build bridges of\r\nunderstanding and to achieve harmony on the basis of\r\nour common humanity. We must avoid ignorance,\r\nwhich many times is the origin of fear and conflict.\r\nClearly, this dialogue is taking place in a new and\r\nunforeseen global context. The whole of humankind\r\nwitnessed with disbelief and horror the terrorist attack\r\ncarried out in the city of New York on 11 September\r\n2001. The consequences of that attack have had an\r\nimpact on major current developments. The world has\r\nnot been the same since then, and will never be the\r\nsame again.\r\nThe current war on terrorism should not mean a\r\nconfrontation among civilizations; nor should it mean a\r\nconfrontation between religions, since, at their core, all\r\nreligions share a similar message of respect and\r\ntolerance towards others. It should definitely not be\r\ninterpreted as a conflict of values. The struggle against\r\nterrorism and the dialogue among civilizations\r\npresuppose the essential need for all human beings to\r\nbe able to enjoy the same potential for human\r\ndevelopment. Diversity in belief, culture, language,\r\nreligion, history and even economic systems should not\r\ndrive humankind towards intolerance. On the contrary,\r\nthose apparent differences can become a valuable\r\nsource of enrichment, complementarity and solidarity.\r\nWe should ask ourselves what prompts people to\r\nturn the terror and suffering of others into a way of life.\r\nHow can we explain the fact that human beings should\r\nacquire such great contempt for their fellows that they\r\nhave no qualms about killing thousands of people, or\r\nsometimes even revel in it?\r\nOne of the elements of the comprehensive fight\r\nagainst terrorism is combating poverty. Given that\r\npoverty provides a breeding ground for ignorance,\r\nresentment and fanaticism, it is clear that this factor\r\nmust be taken into account. In this regard, international\r\nsolidarity between rich and poor countries is of key\r\nimportance. Industrialized countries should make a\r\ngreater effort to fulfil the commitment to devote a\r\nminimum of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product\r\nto international cooperation. Likewise, that solidarity\r\nshould also be reflected in international trade so that\r\nthe products of developing countries can be purchased\r\nat fair prices that are not undermined by unfair trading\r\npractices, which in the end always affect the poorest.\r\nHowever, it is also clear that terrorism does not\r\nboil down to a problem of poverty or economic\r\nexclusion alone. It is well known that many of the\r\nindividuals who have joined terrorist groups, including\r\nsome European groups, and their top leaders were\r\nraised in well-to-do families and have had access to\r\nexcellent educations. Indeed, many of them have for\r\nyears lived in the United States or in Europe, and have\r\ntherefore been exposed to the Western way of life and\r\nculture. Even so, they have clung to their ideology of\r\nterror. Neither poverty nor ignorance can explain that.\r\nFor those reasons it would appear that we need to\r\nlook for the causes of terrorism at a deeper level in the\r\nhuman psyche. I am no specialist in this respect, but I\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.42\r\nhave the impression that one key element is to be found\r\nin intolerance and an inability to understand others —\r\nin other words, in profound self-centredness.\r\nThe call for the dialogue among civilizations to\r\nfocus on changing the mentality that perceives\r\ndiversity as a threat is particularly important, as is the\r\ndevelopment of a new paradigm of international\r\nrelations based on such a change in mentality. I would\r\nalso add the importance of overcoming the mentality\r\nthat considers one’s own ideological, philosophical and\r\nreligious beliefs as the only valid ones. This is the\r\nessence of tolerance, a vital prerequisite for being able\r\nto carry out a dialogue among civilizations.\r\nFrom among the various points that Mr. Picco\r\nmakes, I would like to refer to two in particular:\r\nreassessing our concept of the enemy and the\r\ndevelopment of individual responsibility in\r\ninternational relations. Clearly, one consequence of the\r\nattacks of 11 September is a new pattern of\r\ninternational politics. A bridge has been built between\r\nformer rivals, and a global threat has been identified,\r\ncalling for the concerted efforts of all States and\r\nindividuals. Unfortunately for the terrorists, rather than\r\nsparking conflict among civilizations, the attacks of\r\n11 September have reinforced the unity of the global\r\ncivilization in opposing and combating this scourge.\r\nThis newly emerged phase of global civilization\r\nhas a number of distinctive features. Notwithstanding\r\nour cultural, political, ethnic or racial differences, we\r\nall share respect for human life, a love of freedom and\r\na commitment to pass on to our children a better world.\r\nThis set of beliefs is without question the doctrine of\r\nhuman rights. Respect for human rights is, in the final\r\nanalysis, the first global ethic that humankind has\r\ndeveloped. This is precisely the global ethic to which\r\nthe Group of Eminent Persons refers at the end of the\r\nexecutive summary of its publication, and it should\r\nserve as the basis for the dialogue among civilizations.\r\nAccordingly, one fundamental task that humankind\r\nmust face is to continue to bolster the doctrine of\r\nhuman rights and, above all, to strengthen effective\r\nways and means of promoting and protecting them.\r\nThe call to strengthen multilateral responsibility\r\nin international relations is a key point. Tolerance must\r\nprevail over lack of understanding among cultures. Our\r\ndeepest sense of love for humanity must prevail over\r\ngestures of contempt for life. These are the values that\r\nshould characterize the global civilization of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\n"
