(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: I would like to welcome the\r\nheads of State and Government, as well as other heads\r\nof delegation, who have assembled here for the general\r\ndebate at this important and challenging time. I am\r\nparticularly heartened by such high-level participation\r\nfrom all Member States despite the rescheduling of the\r\ngeneral debate. Let me also express my gratitude for\r\nthe special arrangements that our host country, the\r\nUnited States of America, and the host city, New York,\r\nhave made to ensure the maximum convenience and\r\nsecurity of all participants.\r\nThe heinous terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nwere an unspeakable tragedy not just for the United\r\nStates, but for the entire international community. They\r\ndeeply affected the work of the United Nations, forcing\r\nus to postpone and reschedule various events, including\r\nthe start of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. The general debate has had to be postponed\r\nfor seven weeks and the special session on children for\r\nan even longer period. Thus, the opening of the general\r\ndebate today carries with it both a special meaning and\r\na renewed sense of responsibility.\r\nThe actions of the United Nations in the past two\r\nmonths give proof of our united response to the\r\nchallenge. Beginning with the unanimous resolution\r\nadopted by the General Assembly on 12 September and\r\nthe two important resolutions of the Security Council,\r\nwe have moved quickly and decisively to address the\r\noverriding issue of terrorism. Also, progress has been\r\nmade by the Sixth Committee towards finalizing a\r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism. Taking this\r\nopportunity, I would like to appeal to all Member\r\nStates to further strengthen cooperation for an early\r\nconclusion of the convention.\r\nBut our work has by no means been limited to the\r\nissue of terrorism. In view of the time constraints\r\nimposed after 11 September, the Member States have\r\nacted with increased harmony and expeditiousness to\r\ndeal with wide-ranging issues of global concern. I\r\ncongratulate the delegations on what they have\r\nachieved thus far and urge them to carry on in the same\r\nspirit.\r\nFor the United Nations, the last two months were\r\nalso marked by a uniquely reassuring and encouraging\r\ndevelopment. We were all delighted and honoured to\r\nlearn that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001 had been\r\nawarded to the United Nations as such, jointly with its\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan. I believe that the award\r\nshould be seen as both a recognition of past\r\nachievements and a summons to even greater efforts in\r\nthe future. It is this heavy responsibility that will be\r\nuppermost in my mind when I travel to Oslo in\r\nDecember, along with our Secretary-General, to accept\r\nthe Prize on behalf of the United Nations.\r\nThe issues that we are going to address during the\r\nnext week in this Hall bear a heightened importance\r\nand urgency in view of the current international\r\ncircumstances. Therefore, I would like to solicit the\r\nfull cooperation of all participants to ensure a\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nproductive outcome worthy of our high expectations\r\nand of the ideals for which the United Nations stands.\r\nI now give the floor to the Secretary-General.\r\nStatement by the Secretary-General\r\nThe Secretary-General: Let me welcome all\r\nwho have come to New York for this general debate,\r\nand especially the President of our host country.\r\nWe meet nearly seven weeks later than we had\r\nintended — and we all know why.\r\nNo words can express our revulsion and sorrow at\r\nthe senseless loss of life on 11 September. We share in\r\nthe pain and grief of our host country and host city.\r\nLike them, we are determined to overcome the forces\r\nthat inflicted this ordeal upon us. The United Nations is\r\nindeed “the indispensable common house of the entire\r\nhuman family”, as our heads of State and Government\r\ndeclared last year, and seldom has the need for it been\r\nmore widely understood. When a family is under\r\nattack, it is in their common house that its members\r\ngather to decide what to do.\r\nFrom the very day after the tragedy, while\r\nMembers took action in their own countries and\r\nregions, their representatives here have been at work —\r\nfirst expressing their condemnation and resolve, then\r\nworking out in detail how the world can protect itself.\r\nThe United Nations has also been straining every nerve\r\nto bring relief to the suffering people of Afghanistan\r\nand to help them reach agreement on a broad-based\r\nGovernment.\r\nOne is tempted to say that we must now focus all\r\nour energies on the struggle against terrorism and on\r\ndirectly related issues. Yet, if we did so we should give\r\nthe terrorists a kind of victory.\r\nLet us remember that none of the issues that\r\nfaced us on 10 September has become less urgent. The\r\nnumber of people living on less than one dollar a day\r\nhas not decreased. The numbers dying of AIDS,\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases\r\nhave not decreased. The factors that cause the desert to\r\nadvance, biodiversity to be lost and the Earth’s\r\natmosphere to warm have not decreased. And, in the\r\nmany parts of the world afflicted by the scourge of war,\r\ninnocent people have not ceased being murdered or\r\nmutilated, dragged or driven from their homes.\r\nIn short, my friends, the agenda of peace,\r\ndevelopment and human rights set for us in the\r\nMillennium Declaration is no less pressing. If\r\nanything, it has taken on new urgency. Seldom have the\r\ndanger of division within the human family, and the\r\nneed to resist that danger, been more clearly\r\nunderstood.\r\nWe face two possible futures: a mutually\r\ndestructive clash between so-called civilizations based\r\non the exaggeration of religious and cultural\r\ndifferences, or a global community, respecting\r\ndiversity and rooted in universal values. The latter\r\nmust be our choice, but we can achieve it only if we\r\nbring real hope to the billions now trapped in poverty,\r\nconflict and disease. That is why the current meeting of\r\nthe World Trade Organization is so important. Never\r\nwas agreement among nations rich and poor on the\r\nrules of the international trading system so vitally\r\nneeded.\r\nBut even more decisive will be the use that\r\nMember States make of this Organization in the years\r\nahead. Let me recall some fundamental principles by\r\nwhich I believe all our work must be guided.\r\nFirst, the United Nations must always stand for\r\nthe rule of law in international and domestic affairs.\r\nSecondly, we must cherish our multilateral\r\ninstitutions and procedures and use them to full effect.\r\nThirdly, the United Nations must place people at\r\nthe centre of everything it does, enabling them to meet\r\ntheir needs and realize their full potential. That can be\r\nachieved only in a world of effective, accountable\r\nStates which use sovereignty as a means to ensure the\r\nsecurity of their peoples and to uphold, not violate,\r\ntheir rights.\r\nFourthly, all the actors of the international system\r\nmust work together in pursuit of common goals. The\r\nUnited Nations should concentrate on those areas\r\nwhere it has comparative advantage. Where others have\r\ngreater expertise and resources, it must seek to ensure\r\nthat they apply them to the common needs of humanity.\r\nIn other words, it must reach out to the widest possible\r\nrange of partners.\r\nFinally, what the United Nations does, it must do\r\nwell. We must continue improving our ability to give\r\nour Members the service they expect, and to fulfil the\r\npriorities that Members have identified.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nLet me now mention four burning issues on\r\nwhich our performance will be decisive.\r\nFirst is the eradication of extreme poverty. In the\r\nMillennium Declaration, heads of State and\r\nGovernment resolved to halve, by 2015, the proportion\r\nof the world’s population whose income is less than $1\r\na day, who suffer from hunger and who are unable to\r\nreach or to afford safe drinking water. Achieving this\r\nobjective is a shared responsibility. Much must be done\r\nby the developing countries. But, to reach the point\r\nwhere they can really benefit from market\r\nopportunities, they need generous help from the\r\ndeveloped countries. I will do my utmost to ensure that\r\nthis fundamental issue is addressed.\r\nSecondly, I shall intensify my commitment to the\r\nstruggle against HIV/AIDS — the spread of which our\r\nheads of State and Government pledged to halt, and\r\nbegin to reverse, by 2015. To have any hope of\r\nredeeming that pledge, we must all make it a genuine\r\npriority for years to come.\r\nThirdly, I shall maintain and strengthen the focus\r\nof our work on preventing deadly conflict. We must not\r\nwait passively for crises to erupt, but tackle the root\r\ncauses of political violence.\r\nWe need systems of governance that promote free\r\nexpression and social justice, while protecting civil\r\nliberties and minority rights. We must attack the gross\r\ninequality of opportunity, which so deeply divides\r\npeople in different parts of the world — and sometimes\r\ndifferent parts of a single country.\r\nFourthly, I take very seriously the pledge made in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration to spare\r\n“our children and grandchildren ... from the threat\r\nof living on a planet irredeemably spoilt by\r\nhuman activities, and whose resources would no\r\nlonger be sufficient for their needs.” (resolution\r\n55/2, para. 21)\r\nWe must put the issue of sustainability where it\r\nbelongs, in the centre of the policymaking process.\r\nThe common thread connecting all these issues is\r\nthe need to respect fundamental human rights; and\r\nAfrica is the region where all of them present the\r\ngreatest challenge. I am determined to integrate human\r\nrights even more fully into every aspect of our work.\r\nAnd, taking my cue from the Millennium Declaration, I\r\nintend to ensure that the United Nations fully supports\r\nthe priorities established by the African leaders in the\r\nNew Partnership for African Development.\r\nInevitably, we shall be dealing with all these\r\nissues over the next five years, day in and day out. But\r\nthere are two events next year that I want especially to\r\nbring to the Assembly’s attention: the Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in March, and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in September.\r\nThose meetings, if properly prepared and\r\nmanaged, can mark a real turning point in our struggle\r\nto eradicate poverty and achieve genuinely sustainable\r\ndevelopment. I shall do everything in my power to\r\nensure their success. Let me entreat all of you to do the\r\nsame.\r\nNow let me turn to the last of my fundamental\r\nprinciples: the principle that what this Organization\r\ndoes, it must do well.\r\nDuring my first term I have worked with\r\nMembers to improve the efficiency and coordination of\r\nthe Secretariat, and to bring greater coherence to the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nHave we achieved something? Yes, we have. Our\r\nOrganization is better and more effective than it was\r\nfive years ago. Its financial situation has at last\r\nimproved — thanks to full payment of dues by many\r\nMember States, and significant arrearage payments\r\nfrom a few. In future, let us keep it on a firm financial\r\nfooting.\r\nBut have we yet succeeded in giving the world’s\r\npeoples the effective instrument they need? No, we\r\nhave not. We need to sit together and think afresh about\r\nthe way we work, and whether our system is adequate\r\nfor its tasks.\r\nFor instance, are we really devoting our resources\r\nand energies to the priorities Members have given us?\r\nHow can the contributions of civil society — including\r\nthe private sector — be better organized? How can the\r\nUnited Nations function more effectively as a single\r\nentity, in each country where it works? And how can\r\nwe ensure not only that we attract the best possible\r\nstaff, but that staff at all levels are encouraged to think\r\nand act creatively?\r\nThis may seem a prosaic note to end on. But the\r\nworld’s people will judge us by our ability to perform\r\nspecific tasks: not by the resounding speeches we\r\nmake, or the number of decisions we reach, but by the\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nquality of those decisions, and of the service we\r\nprovide.\r\nFor the sake of all those whom we hope to\r\nsave — whether from terrorism, from war, from\r\npoverty, from disease or from environmental\r\ndegradation — let us resolve that only the best is good\r\nenough. And let us equip ourselves so that, in future,\r\nthe best is what we give.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis statement.\r\nBefore we hear the next speaker, I should once\r\nagain to like to appeal to Member States to limit their\r\nstatements to 15 minutes so that all the speakers\r\ninscribed for each meeting of the seven-day period of\r\nthe general debate can be accommodated at that\r\nmeeting.\r\nAddress by Mr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso,\r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by the\r\nPresident of the Federative Republic of Brazil.\r\nMr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Fernando Henrique\r\nCardoso, President of the Federative Republic of\r\nBrazil, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Cardoso (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I greet you,\r\nMr. President, and pay tribute to the Republic of Korea,\r\nwhich offers the world an example of dedication to the\r\ncause of peace and development.\r\nI reaffirm my admiration for Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, who, together with the United Nations,\r\nwas rightfully honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nMore than ever, we need his clear vision and courage\r\nin seeking to build a peaceful and democratic\r\ninternational order that is based on solidarity. Only\r\nfanatics fail to acknowledge the great mission\r\nundertaken by the United Nations and by Kofi Annan.\r\nIn a tradition that extends back to the beginnings\r\nof this Organization, the month of September in New\r\nYork is dedicated to a celebration of dialogue: the\r\nopening of the general debate of this General\r\nAssembly. It was not so this year. In New York as well\r\nas in Washington, the month of September was marked\r\nby the very denial of this dialogue and understanding\r\nbetween peoples: the senseless violence resulting from\r\nan odious and treacherous attack against the United\r\nStates of America and against all peace- and freedom-\r\nloving peoples.\r\nIt was an infamous act of aggression against a\r\ncity that, perhaps more than any other, is a symbol of\r\ncosmopolitanism; a city that has welcomed immigrants\r\nfrom all parts, such as the Dutch Jews of Portuguese\r\nancestry who, in the seventeenth century, left Brazil for\r\nwhat was then New Amsterdam.\r\nNew York has grown, prospered and reached\r\nmaturity guided by pluralistic values. It became great,\r\nand was admired, not only because of its Jewish and\r\nAnglo-Saxon heritage, but also because of its Arab,\r\nLatin, African, Caribbean and Asian presence. The\r\nattacks of 11 September 2001 were an act of aggression\r\nagainst all of those traditions — an act of aggression\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nAs the first head of State to speak in the general\r\ndebate at this session of the General Assembly, I wish\r\nto be very clear. As I had occasion to say on the very\r\nmorning of those horrendous attacks, and as I have said\r\nduring my conversations with President George W.\r\nBush, Brazil extends its full solidarity and support to\r\nthe people of the United States in its response to\r\nterrorism.\r\nTo our understanding, the American hemisphere\r\nas a whole was attacked. That is why we suggested\r\nconvening the consultative organ of the Inter-American\r\nTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance. Terrorism negates all\r\nthat the United Nations stands for. It destroys the very\r\nprinciples of civilized behaviour. It fosters fear, and\r\nthreatens the security and peace of all countries.\r\nThe victims of any act of terrorism will not be\r\nforgotten; nor will the perpetrators of such acts go\r\nunpunished, whether they are individuals, groups or the\r\nStates that give them support. The march of folly will\r\nbe vigorously resisted by the solid alliance of all free\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations acknowledges\r\nthe right of Member States to act in self-defence. That\r\nis not in doubt. But let us keep in mind that the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism cannot rely exclusively on the\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\neffectiveness of self-defence measures or on the use of\r\nmilitary force by individual countries.\r\nIn 1945, the United Nations committed itself to\r\nthe task of laying the foundations for peace and the\r\nprotection of future generations against the scourge of\r\nwar. War always takes a heavy human toll — a cost in\r\nlives cut short and lives overtaken by fear and flight.\r\nThat underscores the responsibility of terrorists for\r\nwhat is happening today. Brazil hopes that,\r\nnotwithstanding these circumstances, humanitarian\r\nassistance efforts in Afghanistan will not be frustrated.\r\nFurthermore, we will, to the best of our abilities,\r\nwelcome refugees wishing to settle in our country.\r\nCertain things may be obvious, but they warrant\r\nrepeating. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, the\r\nstruggle against terrorism is not, and must never\r\nbecome, a clash between civilizations, much less\r\nbetween religions. Not one of the civilizations that\r\nhave enriched and humanized our planet has not\r\nknown, within its own historical experience, episodes\r\nof violence and terror.\r\nAround the world, problems related to crime,\r\ndrug abuse, drug-trafficking and money-laundering are\r\nevils related to terrorism that must be eradicated. From\r\nthis rostrum, I would like to call for a worldwide public\r\nawareness campaign to make drug users in all countries\r\nrealize that they are helping — even if inadvertently —\r\nto finance terrorism.\r\nIf we are to stem the flow of resources to the\r\nterrorist networks spreading death and destruction, it is\r\ncrucial that drug use in our societies be drastically\r\ncurtailed. Furthermore, we must not allow differences\r\nin national tax regimes in various countries to be used\r\nas an instrument to foster capital flight, to the\r\ndetriment of economic development, or to help finance\r\norganized crime, including terrorist actions. If the\r\nexistence of tax havens is inseparable from these\r\nproblems, then tax havens should not exist. We must\r\nput an end to such safe harbours for corruption and\r\nterror, with regard to which some Governments have,\r\nto date, been complacent.\r\nIt is only natural that, since 11 September, issues\r\nof international security should have been given high\r\npriority. Yet terrorism must not be allowed to stifle the\r\ndebate on cooperation and other issues of global\r\ninterest. The road to the future requires the forces of\r\nglobalization to be harnessed in the pursuit of lasting\r\npeace — a peace sustained not by fear, but rather by\r\nthe willing acceptance by all countries of a just\r\ninternational order.\r\nOn this theme, I have sought to mobilize\r\nnumerous world leaders. Brazil wishes to do its part to\r\nensure that the world does not squander the\r\nopportunities that are contained in the present crisis.\r\nLet us focus on our fundamental imperative of\r\npromoting development. The process of globalization\r\nis tainted by an undeniable sense of unease. I am not\r\nreferring to the ideological disquiet of those who\r\noppose globalization on principle or who reject the\r\nvery notion of universal values which inspire freedom\r\nand the respect for human rights. Rather, I have in\r\nmind the fact that globalization has not lived up to its\r\npromises. There is a governance deficit in the\r\ninternational sphere, and it results from a democratic\r\ndeficit. Globalization will be sustainable only if\r\nenriched by a sense of justice. Our aim should be\r\n“globalization in solidarity”, rather than the\r\nasymmetrical globalization of today.\r\nIn the field of trade, it is high time that\r\nmultilateral negotiations were translated into greater\r\naccess for goods from developing countries to the more\r\nprosperous markets. The ministers meeting in Doha\r\nhave a heavy responsibility: to ensure that the new\r\nround of multilateral trade negotiations is a\r\ndevelopment round. To this end, it is crucial for\r\npriority to be given to those issues most conducive to\r\nthe dismantling of protectionist practices and barriers\r\nin developed countries.\r\nBrazil has taken the lead in negotiations to ensure\r\ngreater market access and better humanitarian\r\nconditions in the fight against disease. We will seek to\r\nstrike a balance between the requirements of patent\r\nrights and the imperative of providing care to those\r\nmost in need. We favour market practices and the\r\nprotection of intellectual property, but not at the cost of\r\nhuman lives. This is a point that must be carefully\r\ndefined: life must prevail over material interests.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions must be revamped\r\nif they are to respond to the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. The International Monetary Fund must be\r\nallotted greater resources so as to allow it to function\r\nas a lender of last resort. The World Bank and regional\r\nbanks must be given a more active part in fostering\r\neconomic growth and development.\r\nThe volatility of international capital flows must\r\nbe contained and the financial system made more\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\npredictable and less crisis-prone, as proposed by the\r\nG-20.\r\nSimilarly, although measures such as the Tobin\r\ntax present practical difficulties, it should be possible\r\nto look into better and less compulsory alternatives. I\r\nsubmit that these issues should be given special\r\nattention at the United Nations International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nnext year in Monterrey.\r\nWe must also envisage practical forms of\r\ncooperation to alleviate the tragedy of AIDS, above all\r\nin Africa. How long will the world remain indifferent\r\nto the plight of those who might yet be saved from\r\ndisease, deprivation and exclusion?\r\nThe twentieth century came to an end amid a\r\ngrowing sense of global citizenship and universally\r\nshared values. Brazil is determined to forge ahead in\r\nthis direction.\r\nThe International Criminal Court will be a\r\nhistoric victory for the cause of human rights. The\r\nprotection of the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are equally pressing challenges of our\r\ntime. The process of climate change has been\r\nscientifically ascertained as a fact, but it is not\r\nunstoppable. What the future holds depends on what\r\nwe do today, in particular as concerns the Kyoto\r\nProtocol.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI have just been informed of the successful\r\noutcome of the Marrakesh meeting. Brazil warmly\r\nwelcomes this development, which is a fundamental\r\nstep towards controlling, and eventually reversing, the\r\nwarming of the atmosphere. I will submit to the\r\nCongress a proposal for the prompt ratification of the\r\nKyoto Protocol.\r\n(spoke in Portuguese)\r\nRecent events in this city and elsewhere have\r\nclearly demonstrated the grave threat posed by\r\nweapons of mass destruction. No matter the nature of\r\nthe menace — be it bacteriological, such as anthrax;\r\nchemical; or nuclear — there is no alternative to\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nIt is an ethical imperative that science and\r\ntechnology must not be turned into a weapon in the\r\nhands of the irresponsible. This requires the active and\r\nlegitimate involvement of the United Nations in the\r\ncontrol, destruction and eradication of these arsenals.\r\nJust as it supported the creation of the State of\r\nIsrael, Brazil today calls for concrete measures towards\r\nthe setting up of a Palestinian state that is democratic,\r\nunited and economically viable.\r\nThe right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and respect for the existence of Israel as\r\na sovereign, free and secure State are essential if the\r\nMiddle East is to rebuild its future in peace.\r\nThis is a moral debt owed by the United Nations.\r\nIt is a task that must not be postponed.\r\nIt is equally urgent that a lasting solution be\r\nfound to the conflict in Angola, which deserves the\r\nopportunity to get back on the road to development.\r\nThis is the same future that Brazil wishes for East\r\nTimor, which we hope will soon take its rightful place\r\nin the Assembly as a sovereign state.\r\nA strong and flexible United Nations is required\r\nif the world is to respond to increasingly complex\r\nproblems. The United Nations will only be\r\nstrengthened if the General Assembly becomes more\r\nactive and more respected, and if the Security Council\r\nbecomes more representative. Its composition should\r\nno longer be a reflection of arrangements among the\r\nvictors of a conflict that took place over 50 years ago,\r\nand for whose triumph Brazilian soldiers gave their\r\nblood in the glorious campaigns in Italy.\r\nBrazil joins those who appeal for more\r\ndemocracy in international relations in calling for the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council. Common sense\r\nrequires the inclusion, in the category of permanent\r\nmembers, of those developing countries with the\r\nnecessary credentials to exercise the responsibilities\r\nthat today’s world imposes upon them.\r\nBy the same token, Brazil believes that an\r\nenlargement of the G-7/G-8 is called for in view of the\r\ntransformations the world is presently undergoing. It is\r\nno longer admissible to restrict to such a limited group\r\nof countries the discussion of issues pertaining to\r\nglobalization and its inevitable impact on the political\r\nand economic life of emerging countries.\r\nAn international order that is more just and based\r\non solidarity will come about only through a concerted\r\neffort on the part of the community of nations. This is\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\ntoo precious a goal to be left to the vagaries of market\r\nforces or to the whims of power politics.\r\nWe do not aspire to a world government, but we\r\ncannot sidestep the obligation to ensure that\r\ninternational relations are not left rudderless, but\r\nreflect the legitimate aspirations of the majority. The\r\nnefarious shadow of terrorism points to what can be\r\nexpected if we do not enhance mutual understanding\r\namong peoples.\r\nThis Organization was created under the sign of\r\ndialogue — a dialogue among sovereign States that are\r\nfree nations, whose peoples actively participate in\r\nnational decision-making.\r\nWith their help, we can ensure that the twenty-\r\nfirst century will not be a time of fear, but rather of the\r\nflourishing of a freer humanity, at peace with itself, and\r\nrationally oriented towards the building of an\r\ninternational order that is acceptable to all peoples and\r\nthat provides a guiding framework for States at the\r\nglobal level.\r\nThis is the challenge of the twenty-first century.\r\nLet us face it inspired by the grand vision of the\r\nfounding fathers of this Organization, who dreamed of\r\na pluralistic world, founded on peace, solidarity,\r\ntolerance and reason, which is the ultimate source of\r\nthe rule of law.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, President of the\r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. George W. Bush, President of the\r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nMr. George W. Bush, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. George W. Bush, President\r\nof the United States of America, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bush: We meet in a Hall devoted to\r\npeace; in a city scarred by violence; in a nation\r\nawakened to danger; in a world uniting for a long\r\nstruggle. Every civilized nation here today is resolved\r\nto keep the most basic commitment of civilization. We\r\nwill defend ourselves and our future against terror and\r\nlawless violence.\r\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause. In\r\nthe Second World War, we learned that there is no\r\nisolation from evil. We affirmed that some crimes are\r\nso terrible they offend humanity itself, and we resolved\r\nthat the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must\r\nbe opposed early, decisively and collectively, before\r\nthey threaten us all.\r\nThat evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\r\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a\r\ntomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary-General, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and I will visit that\r\nsite, where the names of every nation and region that\r\nlost citizens will be read aloud. If we were to read out\r\nthe names of every person who died, it would take\r\nmore than three hours.\r\nThose names include a citizen of the Gambia,\r\nwhose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, 12\r\nSeptember, searching in vain for her husband. Those\r\nnames include a man who supported his wife in\r\nMexico, sending home money every week. Those\r\nnames include a young Pakistani who prayed towards\r\nMecca five times a day and who died that day trying to\r\nsave others.\r\nThe suffering of 11 September was inflicted on\r\npeople of many faiths and many nations. All of the\r\nvictims, including Muslims, were killed with equal\r\nindifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist\r\nleaders.\r\nThe terrorists are violating the tenets of every\r\nreligion, including the one they invoke. Last week, the\r\nsheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world’s oldest\r\nIslamic institution of higher learning, declared that\r\nterrorism is a disease and that Islam prohibits killing\r\ninnocent civilians. The terrorists call their cause holy,\r\nyet they fund it with drug dealing. They encourage\r\nmurder and suicide in the name of a great faith that\r\nforbids both. They dare to ask God’s blessing as they\r\nset out to kill innocent men, women and children. But\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nthe God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such\r\na prayer. And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a\r\nmurderer.\r\nTime is passing. Yet for the United States of\r\nAmerica, there will be no forgetting 11 September. We\r\nwill remember every rescuer who died in honour. We\r\nwill remember every family that lives in grief. We will\r\nremember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the\r\nfunerals of the children.\r\nAnd the people of my country will remember\r\nthose who have plotted against us. We are learning\r\ntheir names. We are coming to know their faces. There\r\nis no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to\r\nprotect them. However long it takes, their hour of\r\njustice will come.\r\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause. As we\r\nmeet, the terrorists are planning more murder —\r\nperhaps in my country, or perhaps, fellow members, in\r\nyours. They kill because they aspire to dominate. They\r\nseek to overthrow Governments and to destabilize\r\nentire regions. Last week, anticipating this meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly, they denounced the United\r\nNations; they called our Secretary-General a criminal\r\nand they condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to\r\nIslam. Few countries meet their exacting standards of\r\nbrutality and oppression. Every other country is a\r\npotential target.\r\nAnd all the world faces the most horrifying\r\nprospect of all: those same terrorists are searching for\r\nweapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their\r\nhatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use\r\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment\r\nthey are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience\r\nwould prevent it. That threat cannot be ignored; that\r\nthreat cannot be appeased. Civilization itself — the\r\ncivilization we share — is threatened. History will\r\nrecord our response and will judge or justify every\r\nnation in this Hall.\r\nThe civilized world is now responding. We act to\r\ndefend ourselves and to deliver our children from a\r\nfuture of fear. We choose the dignity of life over a\r\nculture of death. We choose lawful change and civil\r\ndisagreement over coercion, subversion and chaos.\r\nThose commitments — hope and order, law and life —\r\nunite people across cultures and continents. Upon those\r\ncommitments depend all peace and progress. For those\r\ncommitments, we are determined to fight.\r\nThe United Nations has risen to this\r\nresponsibility: on 12 September, these buildings\r\nopened for emergency meetings of the General\r\nAssembly and of the Security Council. Before the sun\r\nhad set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by\r\nthe world, and I want to thank you, fellow members,\r\nfor that strong and principled stand.\r\nI also thank the Arab and Islamic countries that\r\nhave condemned terrorist murder. Many of you have\r\nseen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The\r\nterrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred\r\nand extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam. The\r\nauthors of mass murder and their allies have no place\r\nin any culture, and no home in any faith.\r\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by\r\nan expanding global coalition. Not every nation will be\r\npart of every action against the enemy. But every\r\nnation in our coalition has duties. Those duties can be\r\ndemanding, as we in America are learning. We have\r\nalready made adjustments in our laws and in our daily\r\nlives. We are taking new measures to investigate terror\r\nand to protect against threats.\r\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully\r\nconsider their responsibilities and their future. Terrorist\r\ngroups such as Al Qaeda depend upon the aid or\r\nindifference of Governments. They need the support of\r\na financial infrastructure and safe havens to train and\r\nplan and hide.\r\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight\r\nagainst terror but tell us they lack the means to enforce\r\ntheir laws and control their borders. We stand ready to\r\nhelp.\r\nSome Governments still turn a blind eye to the\r\nterrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by. They are\r\nmistaken.\r\nAnd some Governments, while pledging to\r\nuphold the principles of the United Nations, have cast\r\ntheir lot with the terrorists. They support them and\r\nharbour them. And they will find that their welcomed\r\nguests are parasites that will weaken them and\r\neventually consume them. For every regime that\r\nsponsors terror there is a price to be paid, and it will be\r\npaid. The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder\r\nand equally accountable to justice.\r\nThe Taliban are now learning that lesson. That\r\nregime and the terrorists who support it are now\r\nvirtually indistinguishable. Together they promote\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nterror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the\r\nAfghan people. Women are executed in Kabul’s soccer\r\nstadium. They can be beaten for wearing socks that are\r\ntoo thin. Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\r\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is\r\nbringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan. We are\r\nmaking progress against military targets — and that is\r\nour objective. Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize,\r\nnot maximize, the loss of innocent life. I am proud of\r\nthe honourable conduct of the American military. And\r\nmy country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban\r\nhave brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible\r\nburden of war.\r\nThe Afghan people do not deserve their present\r\nrulers. Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing\r\nbut misery and starvation. Even before this current\r\ncrisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the\r\nUnited States and other nations, and millions of\r\nAfghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\r\nI make this promise to all the victims of that\r\nregime: the Taliban’s days of harbouring terrorists, and\r\ndealing in heroin, and brutalizing women are drawing\r\nto a close. When that regime is gone, the people of\r\nAfghanistan will say, with the rest of the world, good\r\nriddance.\r\nI can promise, too, that America will join the\r\nworld in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild\r\ntheir country.\r\nMany nations, including mine, are sending food\r\nand medicine to help Afghans through the winter.\r\nAmerica has airdropped over 1.3 million packages of\r\nrations in Afghanistan. Just this week, we airlifted\r\n20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into\r\nthe region. We continue to provide humanitarian aid,\r\neven while the Taliban try to steal the food we send.\r\nMore help, eventually, will be needed. The\r\nUnited States will work closely with the United\r\nNations and development banks to reconstruct\r\nAfghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the\r\nTaliban are no longer in control. And the United States\r\nwill work with the United Nations to support a post-\r\nTaliban Government that represents all of the Afghan\r\npeople.\r\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for\r\nwhat we have done or what we have left undone. After\r\ntragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.\r\nMy country has been very grateful for both.\r\nThe memorials and vigils around the world will\r\nnot be forgotten. But the time for sympathy has now\r\npassed. The time for action has now arrived.\r\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict\r\nhave already been defined by the United Nations. On\r\n28 September, the Security Council adopted resolution\r\n1373 (2001). Its requirements are clear: every\r\nUnited Nations Member has a responsibility to crack\r\ndown on terrorist financing. We must pass all necessary\r\nlaws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of\r\nterrorist assets. We must apply those laws to every\r\nfinancial institution in every nation.\r\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and\r\ncoordinate the efforts of law enforcement. If you know\r\nsomething, tell us. If we know something, we will tell\r\nyou. And when we find the terrorists, we must work\r\ntogether to bring them to justice.\r\nWe have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary,\r\nsafe haven, or transit to terrorists. Every known\r\nterrorist camp must be shut down, its operators\r\napprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe have a responsibility to deny weapons to\r\nterrorists — and to actively prevent private citizens\r\nfrom providing them.\r\nThese obligations are urgent, and they are binding\r\non every nation with a place in this Hall. Many\r\nGovernments are taking these obligations seriously,\r\nand my country appreciates it. Yet even beyond\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), more is required — and more\r\nis expected — of our coalition against terror. We are\r\nasking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.\r\nWe must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just\r\nsome of them. In this world, there are good causes and\r\nbad causes, and we may disagree on where that line is\r\ndrawn. Yet there is no such thing as a good terrorist.\r\nNo national aspiration, no remembered wrong, can ever\r\njustify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any\r\nGovernment that rejects this principle — trying to pick\r\nand choose its terrorist friends — will know the\r\nconsequences.\r\nWe must speak the truth about terror. Let us never\r\ntolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the\r\nattacks of 11 September — malicious lies that attempt\r\nto shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves,\r\naway from the guilty. To inflame ethnic hatred is to\r\nadvance the cause of terror.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nThe war against terror must not serve as an\r\nexcuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in\r\nany country. Innocent people must be allowed to live\r\ntheir own lives, by their own customs, under their own\r\nreligion. And every nation must have avenues for the\r\npeaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these\r\navenues are closed, the temptation to speak through\r\nviolence grows.\r\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and\r\nprosperity in every land. My country is pledged to\r\nencouraging development and expanding trade. My\r\ncountry is pledged to investing in education and\r\ncombating AIDS and other infectious diseases around\r\nthe world. Following 11 September, these pledges are\r\neven more important. In our struggle against hateful\r\ngroups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer\r\nan alternative of opportunity and hope.\r\nThe American Government also stands by its\r\ncommitment to a just peace in the Middle East. We are\r\nworking towards a day when two States — Israel and\r\nPalestine — live peacefully together, within secure and\r\nrecognized borders, as called for by the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. We will do all in our power to\r\nbring both parties back into negotiations. But peace\r\nwill come only when all have sworn off — forever —\r\nincitement, violence and terror.\r\nFinally, this struggle is a defining moment for the\r\nUnited Nations itself — and the world needs its\r\nprincipled leadership. It undermines the credibility of\r\nthis great institution, for example, when the\r\nCommission on Human Rights offers seats to some of\r\nthe world’s most persistent violators of human rights.\r\nThe United Nations depends, above all, on its moral\r\nauthority — and that authority must be preserved.\r\nThe steps I have described will not be easy. For\r\nall nations, they will require effort. For some nations,\r\nthey will require great courage. Yet the cost of inaction\r\nis far greater. The only alternative to victory is a\r\nnightmare world where every city is a potential killing\r\nfield.\r\nAs I told the American people, freedom and fear\r\nare at war. We face enemies that hate not our policies,\r\nbut our existence — the tolerance of openness and the\r\ncreative culture that define us. But the outcome of this\r\nconflict is certain.\r\nThere is a current in history, and it runs towards\r\nfreedom. Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the\r\ndreams of mankind are defined by liberty — the natural\r\nright to create, and build, and worship, and live in\r\ndignity. When men and women are released from\r\noppression and isolation, they find fulfilment and hope,\r\nand they leave poverty by the millions. These\r\naspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the\r\nIslamic world. We stand for the permanent hopes of\r\nhumanity, and those hopes will not be denied.\r\nWe are confident, too, that history has an author,\r\nwho fills time and eternity with his purpose. We know\r\nthat evil is real, but good will prevail against it. This is\r\nthe teaching of many faiths. And in that assurance, we\r\ngain strength for a long journey.\r\nIt is our task — the task of this generation — to\r\nprovide the response to aggression and terror. We have\r\nno other choice, because there is no other peace. We\r\ndid not ask for this mission, yet there is honour in\r\nhistory’s call. We have a chance to write the story of\r\nour times — a story of courage defeating cruelty, and\r\nlight overcoming darkness. This calling is worthy of\r\nany life, and worthy of every nation. So let us go\r\nforward — confident, determined and unafraid.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United\r\nStates of America for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. George W. Bush, President of the United\r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of South\r\nAfrica.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President of\r\nthe Republic of South Africa, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mbeki: Please accept my\r\ncongratulations, Mr. President, on your assumption of\r\nthe stewardship of this important Assembly.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nWe also wish to congratulate your predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the skilful manner in which he\r\nguided the work of the Millennium Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAllow me also to salute the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, on being elected to a second term and,\r\ntogether with the United Nations, being awarded the\r\nNobel Peace Prize for 2001. This is because of the\r\ntireless work of both the Secretary-General and the\r\nUnited Nations to realize the ideal that we all cherish: a\r\nworld in which all people can live in peace, security,\r\nfreedom, equality and justice.\r\nAs has already been noted and as we all know,\r\nthis general debate has begun later than usual. The\r\nreason for this is that two months ago, the forces of\r\nterror struck at this city, New York — the Headquarters\r\nof this Organization — and Washington, D.C., the\r\ncapital city of the United States of America.\r\nIt is proper that we take advantage of this\r\noccasion once more to convey our condolences and\r\ndeepest sympathy to the people and the Government of\r\nthe United States for the immense loss of life and\r\nproperty imposed on them through a callous act of\r\nmurder. We extend the same sympathy to all other\r\npeoples who lost citizens as a result of the colossal\r\noutrage of 11 September. We speak here about the\r\nterrible tragedy of 11 September on behalf of our\r\nGovernment and the people of South Africa. We speak\r\nalso on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nCommonwealth.\r\nThere can be no doubt but that the peoples of the\r\nworld have to unite in action to defeat terrorism. There\r\ncan be no hesitation among any of us in the resolve to\r\nwork together to ensure that those responsible for the\r\nheinous actions of September 11 are brought to justice.\r\nThis is so not only because many nations lost\r\ntheir citizens on that terrible day, important as that is. It\r\nis so, because terrorism has demonstrated that it has no\r\nrespect for borders. It has shown in a very graphic,\r\ntragic and painful manner, as it did also in Kenya and\r\nTanzania, that our very humanity renders all of us,\r\nwithout exception, potential targets of cold-blooded\r\nmurder.\r\nWhere we might have used the concept of a\r\nglobal village loosely in the past, on 11 September\r\nterrorism taught us the abiding lesson that we do\r\nindeed belong to a global village. None within this\r\nvillage will be safe unless all the villagers act together\r\nto secure and guarantee that safety. All must act to\r\npromote the safety and security of one and all, on the\r\nbasis of a shared responsibility born of a shared danger.\r\nAccordingly, we have no choice but to get\r\ntogether in the village square to agree on the threat that\r\nconfronts us. Together, in that village square, we have\r\nto determine what we do about this commonly defined\r\nthreat. This is the ineluctable conclusion we must draw\r\nfrom the terrorist attacks of 11 September.\r\nTo guarantee world peace and security in the light\r\nof the threat posed by terrorism requires that this\r\nOrganization, the United Nations, must discharge its\r\nresponsibility to unite the peoples of the world to adopt\r\nan international convention against terrorism.\r\nNecessarily, all of us must experience a shared\r\nsense of ownership of this convention, precisely\r\nbecause it would not be merely a statement of\r\nprinciples, but a set of injunctions and prescriptions\r\nthat will be binding on all of us as States. Thus should\r\neach one of us be ready to integrate our respective\r\nsovereignties within a global human sovereignty,\r\ndefined and governed by all of us, with none treated as\r\nsuperior or inferior.\r\nThe challenge to unite the peoples of the world to\r\nfight the common threat of terrorism brings to the fore\r\nthe need to speed up the transformation of the United\r\nNations so that it is able to respond to the global\r\nchallenges we face together, in an equitable manner.\r\nThis means that it needs to be efficient, effective and\r\nresponsive to the needs of humanity as a whole.\r\n11 September emphasized the point that, even as\r\nthe democratic system of government is being\r\nconsolidated throughout the world, even as we all work\r\nto sustain the possibility of a serious and meaningful\r\nglobal dialogue, there are some who are prepared to\r\nresort to force in pursuit of their goals. Clearly, there\r\nmust be a response. But what should that response be?\r\nImmediately, it is correct that we must achieve\r\nglobal security cooperation so that the perpetrators of\r\nthe 11 September acts of terrorism are apprehended and\r\npunished. Correctly, the Government of the United\r\nStates has emphasized that all action that is carried out\r\nmust be clearly targeted against the terrorists. It has\r\nstated that such actions, including military actions,\r\nshould not degenerate into collective punishment\r\nagainst any people on any grounds whatsoever,\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nincluding those of religion, race or ethnicity.\r\nAccordingly, it is indeed necessary that humanitarian\r\nassistance be extended to the people of Afghanistan.\r\nWe fully agree with that approach. The United States\r\nGovernment has also said that these actions should be\r\nof the shortest duration possible, consistent with the\r\nobjective that must be achieved. Again, we agree with\r\nthis without reservation.\r\nThe call has gone out that all Governments and\r\ncountries should contribute whatever they can to ensure\r\nthat the common efforts to find and punish the\r\nterrorists responsible for 11 September are met with\r\ntheir just results. We have responded positively to this\r\ncall because it is timely, correct and just.\r\nAll these are important elements of what has to\r\nbe done to respond to those who committed the mass\r\nmurders of 11 September. But they also indicate the\r\nway forward as we consider the rules that should guide\r\nus as we confront the threat of terrorism over the\r\nlonger term and beyond the critically important\r\noperations and activities focused on the events of 11\r\nSeptember. They put the matter firmly on our common\r\nagenda: We must also achieve global cooperation for\r\nthe speedy resolution of conflict situations everywhere\r\nin the world.\r\nIn this regard, it is clear that the situation in the\r\nMiddle East cries out for an urgent and lasting solution.\r\nIn this context, we might recall the words of the Irish\r\npoet, William Butler Yeats, when he said “too long a\r\nsacrifice can make a stone of the heart”. The sacrifice\r\nof the Palestinian people should not be allowed to drag\r\non any longer. Whatever these long-suffering people\r\nmight themselves think and feel, it is clear that there\r\nare some in the world who will justify their destructive\r\nrage by claiming to be front-line fighters for the\r\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people.\r\nBeyond this, we must act together to determine\r\nthe issues that drive people to resort to force and agree\r\non what we should do to eliminate those issues. At the\r\nsame time, we must make the point patently clear that\r\nsuch determination does not in any way constitute an\r\nattempt to justify terrorism. Together, we must take the\r\nfirm position that no circumstances whatsoever can\r\never justify resort to terrorism.\r\nThe need to realize together the goal of\r\ndetermining the matters that make for peace once again\r\nunderlines the need for properly representative\r\ninternational institutions to build the necessary global\r\nconsensus. It would seem obvious that the fundamental\r\nsource of conflict in the world today is the socio-\r\neconomic deprivation of billions of people across the\r\nglobe, coexisting side by side with islands of enormous\r\nwealth and prosperity within and among countries. This\r\nnecessarily breeds a deep sense of injustice, social\r\nalienation and despair and a willingness to sacrifice\r\ntheir lives among those who feel they have nothing to\r\nlose and everything to gain, regardless of the form of\r\naction to which they resort.\r\nAs the Durban World Conference concluded,\r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related\r\nintolerance remain a critical part of the practices that\r\nserve to alienate billions of people and contribute to\r\nmutual antagonisms among human beings. The\r\ninternational community should spare no effort to\r\nensure that this affront to human dignity is totally\r\neradicated.\r\nLast year, we convened in this very Hall in the\r\nhistoric Millennium Summit. Solemnly, and with\r\nserious intent, we adopted the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe heavy and urgent obligation we now face is to\r\nimplement the programme of action spelt out in that\r\nDeclaration. This constitutes and must constitute the\r\ndecisive front of struggle against terrorism.\r\nAfrica, for its part, has developed a New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, which is a\r\nproduct of the consciousness among the African people\r\nthat they themselves hold the key to the continent’s\r\ndevelopment, security and stability. Africans across the\r\ncontinent have arrived at the correct determination that\r\nhuman rights, democracy, peace, stability and justice\r\nare the fundamental building blocks for a prosperous\r\ncontinent. Concomitantly, African countries are taking\r\nmeasures, jointly and severally, to improve the\r\nconditions for much-needed investment, economic\r\nrenewal and development. Naturally, the United\r\nNations has a pivotal role to play in this regard.\r\nAs we meet here, members of the World Trade\r\nOrganization are engaged in critical negotiations in\r\nDoha, Qatar, hopefully to agree to a new equitable\r\ntrading relationship that is fair and just. It is imperative\r\nthat there be a non-discriminatory and equitable trading\r\nsystem that promotes sustainable development.\r\nSoon, ministers of health, the World Health\r\nOrganization and others concerned will be finalizing\r\nthe details relating to the global health fund to deal\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nwith the major communicable diseases, including\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and AIDS.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held next March in Mexico, will\r\ncover a range of pertinent issues, such as debt relief,\r\nofficial development assistance and foreign direct\r\ninvestment. As we all know, substantial capital flows\r\ninto the developing countries are critical in the struggle\r\nto defeat poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nAll these constitute vital component parts of what\r\nmust inform the outcome of the Johannesburg World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in September\r\nnext year. We are confident that the Summit will reach\r\npositive conclusions that will include firm global,\r\nregional and national commitments to the elaboration,\r\nintegration and implementation of economically\r\nefficient, socially responsible and environmentally\r\nsound development policies.\r\nThere is no doubt that our global village has the\r\nresources and capacity to meet the needs of all its\r\ncitizens. What is needed is the collective will of the\r\ninternational community to act decisively to meet this\r\nchallenge, inspired by a sense of human solidarity.\r\nPeace and security for all, freedom and democracy for\r\nall, prosperity for all and genuine equality in conditions\r\nof diversity must surely be the outcomes towards which\r\nthe United Nations and all of us must strive. Our\r\nactions must affirm the seriousness of our intent.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thabo Mbeki, President of the Republic of\r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa\r\nAl-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir\r\nof the State of Qatar.\r\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of the\r\nState of Qatar, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa\r\nAl-Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nEmir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani\r\n(spoke in Arabic): It is my pleasure to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly today in my capacity as the Emir of\r\nthe State of Qatar and as Chairman of the Ninth\r\nSummit of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nIt is our duty to make this important session of\r\nthe General Assembly a session for rebuilding\r\nconfidence and realizing the aspirations and\r\nexpectations of our peoples for a world where peace\r\nand prosperity prevail.\r\nI take this opportunity to extend to you, Sir, my\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\r\nthis session, and would like to extend my thanks to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri. I must also\r\ncongratulate Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election as\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General and on receiving the\r\nNobel Peace Prize along with the United Nations.\r\nWe are all aware of the critical and extraordinary\r\ncircumstances in which this session is being held and\r\nof the political situation prevailing in the world in the\r\nwake of the events of 11 September. An analysis of\r\nthese terrible events, which we condemn, prompts us to\r\nsay that humanity has actually reached a tremendous\r\nturning point.\r\nPersonally, I believe that the way to offer the\r\ngreatest peace and serenity to the souls of the victims\r\nof that criminal act, the sincerest consolation to their\r\nfamilies and the most effective support to the friendly\r\nUnited States of America, where these events took\r\nplace, is for the international community as a whole not\r\nonly to confront what happened but also to act\r\ndecisively to avoid the repetition of such acts.\r\nWhat happened in New York and Washington is\r\nunprecedented and almost beyond our imagination.\r\nThere may be some strategic planners who see the\r\nevents as confirming their predictions, but for the rest\r\nof us they would have seemed like fiction only a short\r\ntime ago. Sadly, the events were all too real, and we\r\nwatched with amazement, horror and sympathy as we\r\nrealized their full import for the future of humanity.\r\nDealing with the repercussions of these events\r\nshould not be a matter of merely punishing those\r\nwhose guilt in masterminding and carrying out these\r\ncriminal acts is proved. Inflicting punishment, though\r\nimperative, will not, in my opinion, prevent the\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nrepetition of similar or even more terrible acts in the\r\nfuture.\r\nWe face an extremely serious situation. We are\r\nseeing what could be described as a globalization of\r\nterrorism through the evil utilization of the revolution\r\nof technology and communications. Thus, we are all\r\ninvolved in an unconventional war for which we are\r\nnot yet prepared.\r\nAs we know, terrorism is neither a temporary\r\nphenomenon nor confined to a certain continent, creed,\r\nculture or race; it is everywhere, concealed like time\r\nbombs in our midst.\r\nWe should therefore ask ourselves, what have we\r\ndone as an international community about this\r\nsituation? Have we actually faced up to it? What have\r\nwe done to rebuild confidence among people? What\r\nhave we done to contain the fear that is demoralizing\r\nour citizens? What are we going to do now to stop the\r\neconomic recession and social anxiety that threaten us\r\nall? Furthermore, is this the world we promised at the\r\nMillennium Summit a year ago — a world that would\r\nbe ruled by amity, peace and cooperation?\r\nIf anything, we have moved away from these\r\nideals. We now live in a world where liberties are\r\nincreasingly restricted, where democracy is in retreat\r\nand where caution and isolation are replacing freedom\r\nand openness.\r\nThe State of Qatar, along with all other Islamic\r\ncountries, has condemned the terrorist acts that took\r\nplace on 11 September. This stand was explicitly\r\nexpressed at the emergency meeting of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference Ministers for\r\nForeign Affairs held in Doha last month. Our\r\nunanimous agreement condemning what happened\r\nemanated from the values of our true Islamic religion\r\nand its sublime sharia, which is based on tolerance,\r\njustice, equality and cooperation among people and\r\nforbids the unjust taking of human life. It urges us to\r\nrebuild and to propagate peace and tranquillity.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to stress that what\r\ndeepens our conviction and strengthens our stance\r\ntowards these eternal cultural values is our realization\r\nand understanding of the geopolitical importance of the\r\nMuslim nation, with its diverse peoples, which makes\r\nit a strategic partner in the process of building balanced\r\ninternational relations.\r\nIn fact, this is what makes Muslims deplore those\r\nwho deliberately and desperately try to link Islam with\r\nterrorism. Our peoples condemn and reject terrorism as\r\nwell as all attempts to distort the image of Islam, which\r\nis the last of divine faiths, and those who abuse and\r\nterrorize its adherents and jeopardize their lives,\r\ndignity and interests.\r\nTherefore, it is now necessary to stand resolutely\r\nagainst all forms of harassment against Arab and\r\nMuslim communities in any country that take place\r\nunder the pretext of combating terrorism and the\r\npursuit of terrorists.\r\nWe need to have a clear definition of terrorism\r\nand distinguish between this phenomenon, which is\r\nbased on criminal practices and attacks against\r\ninnocent civilians, and legitimate struggles to throw off\r\nthe yoke of colonialism and subjugation.\r\nTerrorism has taken root not only because of our\r\ninability to tackle the sources of tension in the world’s\r\nhot spots, but also because we have tolerated for too\r\nlong those who pursue policies of repression and deny\r\ntheir citizens fundamental liberties and basic human\r\nrights. The seeds of terrorism lie in places where\r\npluralism is rejected, corruption is allowed to spread,\r\nauthority is exploited and political opponents are\r\nhounded in the guise of protecting the security of\r\nhomelands and people. It is neither just nor logical for\r\nanyone to claim to improve internal conditions by\r\nresorting to oppressive practices or to suspending\r\ndemocracy.\r\nIn this context, we feel it is high time to put an\r\nurgent end to the tragedy of the Palestinian people at\r\nthe hands of the Israeli occupation forces. We call on\r\nthe international community to shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities in providing the necessary international\r\nprotection for these people against the unjustified and\r\nunacceptable daily aggression to which they are\r\nexposed.\r\nThat is indispensable if we want to avert an\r\nimminent human catastrophe, which would lead only to\r\na further cycle of violence, terrorism and destruction in\r\nour region. We urge everyone to support their political\r\nleaders when they call for restraint so as to avoid the\r\nloss of innocent civilian life and so that the right\r\nclimate can be created for a just peace to prevail in that\r\ntroubled region.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nIn this context, we should like to put on record\r\nour support for the positive stance of the President of\r\nthe United States, George W. Bush, and his\r\nAdministration, with regard to the establishment of a\r\nPalestinian State. We would also like to pay tribute in\r\nthis respect to friendly European countries and other\r\ninternational bodies concerned with the settlement of\r\nthe crisis. The ultimate test will be whether they\r\nimplement measures reflecting the positions that they\r\nhave taken and move from making statements to taking\r\naction.\r\nWe must emphasize the need to address the\r\nhuman tragedy of the people of Afghanistan. We\r\nbelieve that it is our duty to provide all possible\r\nassistance to those people, most of whom are living\r\nunder extremely difficult conditions — conditions that\r\nfurther exacerbate their suffering, which was already\r\nacute years before the crisis brought about by the\r\nevents of 11 September.\r\nWe therefore appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to provide assistance and aid to save the\r\nlives of millions of Afghans who are facing a bleak\r\nfuture. There is an urgent and immediate need for relief\r\nas the Afghan winter approaches. We urge the Taliban\r\nauthorities to cooperate fully with relief organizations\r\nto ensure that essential food and medicines can reach\r\nall of their people. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to designate a safe corridor for such\r\nsupplies before winter sets in.\r\nIn addressing these urgent humanitarian concerns,\r\nwe believe that it is essential to seek a long-term\r\nsolution of the Afghan problem, as proposed by the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. Such a\r\nsolution would be based simply on maintaining the\r\nterritorial integrity and Islamic identity of Afghanistan,\r\nand forming a government representing all factions of\r\nAfghan society, excluding none.\r\nIt is the responsibility of the international\r\ncommunity to elaborate comprehensive programmes\r\nand plans to confront all forms of global challenges. In\r\nthis respect, we are convinced of the necessity of\r\nreforming the United Nations so as to step up the\r\neffectiveness of its organs and agencies and to promote\r\nits efficiency. Equally, as States Members of the\r\nOrganization, we are required to shoulder our political\r\nresponsibilities and honour our financial and moral\r\nobligations towards the Organization. In this context,\r\nwe support the idea of expanding the membership of\r\nthe Security Council to make it more democratic and\r\nmore representative of the international community in\r\nour contemporary world. We also support the idea of\r\nexpanding the permanent membership of the Council in\r\norder to secure wider international representation. We\r\nalso support restrictions on the use of the veto on the\r\npart of permanent members, regulating the ability to\r\nexercise that right within limits established by specific\r\nconditions and provisions to be agreed upon by the\r\ninternational Organization.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to say that the\r\ntime has come for us to take steps immediately to\r\nactivate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In\r\nimplementing it, international organizations should not\r\nconfine their role to merely recording the violations of\r\nits principles. They should move towards a\r\ncomprehensive, democratic dialogue that consolidates\r\nits provisions guaranteeing people’s right to participate\r\nin governance, expands its scope and makes it more\r\nresponsive, not just for today’s requirements, but also\r\nfor those of the future.\r\nThe State of Qatar is convinced of the importance\r\nof — indeed, the necessity for — such a dialogue. As\r\nwe would be one of those to benefit from the outcome\r\nof such a dialogue, we are willing to contribute in\r\nmany different ways in order to make this a year for\r\ndemocratic dialogue that would truly reflect the\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter at the\r\nbeginning of this millennium.\r\nIf approached with conviction and resolve, this\r\nendeavour will lead to the interaction of different\r\nviews, and could help to unify our efforts against\r\ncurrent threats and future challenges and dangers. In\r\nthis way, our cultural distinctions could be turned into\r\na source of strength and wealth, our social disparities\r\ncould become an element of diversity and contribution,\r\nand our political and geographical borders could\r\nbecome points of cooperation, convergence and\r\ncommunication among our peoples and nations. That\r\nwould provide an opportunity for all of us to live in a\r\nworld whose inhabitants take pride in their humanity\r\nand look forward to a future of prosperity and well-\r\nbeing for their children and grandchildren without any\r\ndiscrimination or distinction.\r\nMay the peace and blessings of God be upon the\r\nAssembly.\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Emir of the State of\r\nQatar for the statement he has just made.\r\nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of the\r\nState of Qatar, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Vicente Fox, President of the United\r\nMexican States\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the United Mexican States.\r\nMr. Vicente Fox, President of the United Mexican\r\nStates, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations Mr. Vicente Fox, President of the United\r\nMexican States, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Fox (spoke in Spanish): Allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly. I should also like to extend my\r\ncongratulations to all the other members of the Bureau.\r\nI am sure that your prestige and acknowledged\r\ndiplomatic skills will contribute to the successful work\r\nof the General Assembly at this session.\r\nI should also like to extend sincere\r\ncongratulations to this Organization and to the\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan. Mexico welcomes the\r\nfact that they were awarded this year’s Nobel Peace\r\nPrize. That is a well-deserved recognition of the\r\ndedication and clarity of vision that have marked the\r\nwork of the Secretary-General. It fills us with hope\r\nregarding the efforts that this Organization will have to\r\nmake in order to meet the international challenges of\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nI am addressing the General Assembly on behalf\r\nof the women and men of my country, Mexico — a\r\ncountry that is in the process of a profound\r\ntransformation, determined to strengthen democracy\r\nand development, as well as to take on greater\r\nresponsibilities in shaping the new international system\r\nwith a view to fostering the prosperity, peace and\r\nsecurity that every inhabitant of the world deserves.\r\nMexican society is firmly committed to making\r\nMexico a country that contributes positively to the\r\nworthiest objectives of human well-being. Aware that\r\nthere is a diversity of views on ways to achieve this\r\nend, Mexico favours dialogue and agreement as\r\nbenchmarks to guide our endeavours. For Mexico the\r\nUnited Nations is the best example of a global forum\r\nwhere the voices of all men and women can merge into\r\na veritable concert of nations.\r\nThis is a Mexico that today renews its full\r\ncommitment to the United Nations — which not only\r\ndemands full respect for the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law,\r\nbut that is also committed to the development of new,\r\nuniversally observed rules and standards for the\r\nregulation of international relations.\r\nThis is a Mexico that acts firmly in the defence\r\nand protection of human rights and of democracy, at all\r\ntimes and in all places, beginning, of course, within our\r\nown territory, promoting full respect for fundamental\r\nfreedoms on the basis of tolerance, plurality and equity.\r\nThat is why my Government has initiated formal talks\r\nwith the various political parties in Mexico in order to\r\ncreate favourable conditions for the promotion of a\r\nconstitutional reform that will allow Mexico to ratify\r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,\r\nwhich our country signed last year.\r\nMy Government has also started a necessary\r\nupdating of Mexico’s international obligations in the\r\nfield of human rights and international humanitarian\r\nlaw. I have submitted for consideration by the Mexican\r\nSenate the ratification, accession or acceptance of 11\r\nother legal instruments in areas such as the forcible\r\ndisappearance of persons, the rights of the child, the\r\nelimination of discrimination against women and the\r\nprotection of victims of international armed conflicts.\r\nThis new commitment on the part of Mexico to\r\nthe defence of human rights was also reflected in the\r\nrecent release, for humanitarian reasons, of Rodolfo\r\nMontiel and Teodoro Cabrera, two environmental\r\nactivists in Mexico. This effort in the field of human\r\nrights was also reflected in the broad disclosure of\r\nState security agencies files, which will contribute to\r\nincreasing transparency regarding both present and past\r\nevents, thus making it a central element of my\r\nadministration. Mexico is taking concrete steps to\r\ndemonstrate that its commitment to the norms of the\r\ninternational community is profound, sincere and\r\nresolute.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nThe establishment of the United Nations more\r\nthan 50 years ago was the triumph of hope and freedom\r\nover the suffering inflicted by the two world wars on\r\nhumanity, Today, however, threats to peace and\r\nsecurity do not emerge only from acts of aggression\r\namong States. The new threats also arise from internal\r\nconflicts that have cross-border effects, such as the\r\nmassive movement of displaced peoples, humanitarian\r\ntragedies, grave violations of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, and the exacerbation of\r\nnationalism and religious fanaticism. These threats also\r\nderive from worldwide phenomena such as\r\ntransnational organized crime, environmental\r\ndegradation, AIDS, and, of course, terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations.\r\nThere is no doubt that the magnitude and the\r\ncruelty of the 11 September attacks have underscored\r\nthe vulnerability of States and the fragility of world\r\npeace. It is a matter of concern to us that terrorist\r\ngroups can gain access to weapons of mass destruction\r\nand that they also benefit from the traffic in arms,\r\norganized crime, money laundering and drug\r\ntrafficking.\r\nInternational terrorism not only flouts\r\ninternational law, but it also endangers the stability of\r\nthe community of nations and economic development\r\nprocesses, increasing unemployment and preventing\r\nheadway from being made in the alleviation of poverty.\r\nFor this reason, Mexico categorically rejects any\r\nargument that seeks to justify terrorist activities.\r\nNothing — not the justness of a cause, the inequality of\r\nforces with respect to an antagonist, poverty, or any\r\nother grounds — can justify resorting to violence for\r\npolitical ends.\r\nMexico reiterates its commitment to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism and its decision to fully implement\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) of the Security Council, which\r\nestablishes a series of measures for fighting\r\ninternational terrorism and cutting its ties to practices\r\nsuch as money laundering and organized crime.\r\nWe are firmly committed to the fight against new\r\nthreats to international peace and security. We believe\r\nthat the international community should meet these\r\nchallenges on the basis of three principles: first, the\r\nsupremacy of the United Nations; secondly, the\r\nstrengthening of international cooperation in resolving\r\nglobal problems; and thirdly, the shaping of an\r\ninternational order based on universally observed rules\r\nand standards that meet the needs and aspirations of the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nThe Government of Mexico is determined to\r\nassist in this effort. For that reason, Mexico feels\r\ndeeply honoured to have been elected, after a 20-year\r\nabsence, as a non-permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil for 2002-2003. It wishes to express its deep\r\ncommitment in this respect. We thank the international\r\ncommunity for its support and express our\r\ndetermination to work actively and responsibly in\r\nfavour of the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. Our intention is that Mexico’s participation in\r\nthe Security Council will amplify the voices of\r\ncountries that are not usually heard on the international\r\nscene.\r\nIn the search for lasting solutions to the new\r\nthreats now facing the international system, we must\r\nnot fail to address situations that have contributed to\r\ntheir emergence, such as the lack of economic\r\ndevelopment in many nations, the deepening of poverty\r\nand exclusion. The challenges of development not only\r\nremain with us, but have gradually increased with the\r\ngrowing economic and social inequalities.\r\nMexico therefore calls on the international\r\ncommunity to give priority to the fight against poverty\r\nand social exclusion. My country reaffirms its interest\r\nin taking a lead in promoting the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, providing it with renewed impetus and a\r\nmore effective approach, so that the United Nations\r\nand the multilateral institutions can fulfil the\r\ncommitments contained in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nIt is because of the importance we attach to this\r\nissue that Mexico offered to host the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nnext year in Monterrey. I invite all heads of State or\r\nGovernment to contribute, through their active\r\nparticipation in the Conference, to strengthening the\r\ninternational community’s efforts to promote world\r\ndevelopment that is more just and more equitable, thus\r\ncreatively helping to improve the institutions\r\nresponsible for development financing.\r\nWe face the complex task of integrating our\r\nsocieties, without exclusion, in the process of the joint\r\ncreation and equitable distribution of the opportunities\r\nand benefits of globalization. We must ensure that all\r\ncitizens become stakeholders in that process; to do that,\r\nwe need an enabling international environment,\r\nincluding sufficient levels of public and private\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nfunding, along with the consolidation of an inclusive\r\ninternational economic system that is conducive to\r\nmore equitable human development.\r\nIt will be impossible to make the world more just\r\nif we permit the exclusion of the most vulnerable\r\ngroups. That is why my Government has just proposed\r\nthe establishment of a special committee to draft a\r\nbroad, comprehensive international convention to\r\npromote and protect the rights and dignity of disabled\r\npersons. The convention’s ultimate goal should be to\r\nput in place a binding universal legal instrument for the\r\nbenefit of the disabled, guaranteeing the fundamental\r\nrights of millions of men, women and children\r\nworldwide. Mexico hopes that this important\r\nendeavour will enjoy the support of the States Members\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe history of relations among nations reflects\r\nsuccesses, but also sadly missed opportunities. Today,\r\nour efforts to combat terrorism and to promote\r\ndevelopment — the two focuses of my statement\r\ntoday — may be the start of a new history of successes\r\nfor the United Nations.\r\nThe brutal events of 11 September make it\r\nimperative that we, the international community,\r\nengage in multilateral negotiations to formulate new\r\nrules and standards to guarantee international peace\r\nand security. There is no doubt that the way in which\r\nour nations face the challenge of terrorism will have an\r\nimpact on the principles and priorities of international\r\nrelations in coming years.\r\nAs a country that is a bridge between regions and\r\ncultures, Mexico is determined to play an active and\r\nleading role in shaping an international system that can\r\nmeet the challenges facing us today.\r\nThis is a defining moment. Our fundamental\r\nvalues and the vitality and viability of the United\r\nNations are being put to the test. The community of\r\nnations must show that it can meet this extraordinary\r\nchallenge. This can be a new founding stage in the\r\nhistory of the Organization, which will yield the\r\nmandates and competences that are indispensable in a\r\nworld that is starkly different from that of 1945 but\r\nwhose aspirations to peace, respect for human dignity,\r\njustice and freedom still remain those of the San\r\nFrancisco Charter.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United\r\nMexican States for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Vicente Fox, President of the United Mexican\r\nStates, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez, President of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Eastern Republic of\r\nUruguay.\r\nMr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez, President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez,\r\nPresident of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Batlle Ibáñez (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwant first of all to stress that, under the current\r\ncircumstances, our presence — everybody’s\r\npresence — at this general debate unquestionably takes\r\non special significance.\r\nEvery year, the United Nations prepares and\r\nsubmits to Member States for their consideration a\r\ncomprehensive agenda containing many items of varied\r\nscope and nature. This session is no exception: the\r\nUnited Nations will not stop.\r\nYet, many things now appear completely\r\ndifferent. The city of New York, the United States and\r\nevery country, and the people of the United States and\r\nevery people — all of humankind — have been cruelly\r\nattacked by terrorism, and its threat hangs over every\r\none of us and over natural and peaceful relations\r\namong the peoples of the world. In short, this is a\r\nglobal phenomenon that demands of us a global answer\r\nand that has marked the start of the new millennium.\r\nThe nations of my continent believe that to be so. The\r\nstatements made by the Presidents of Brazil and of\r\nMexico, which I endorse, made that perfectly clear.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, which brought us\r\ntogether here last year, provided an opportunity for us\r\nto identify the issues that affect us all and that we must\r\nface as part of a challenge that no one can avoid. It\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\ndefined an agenda of peace and hope for a world\r\naffected by common problems, although, it must be\r\nsaid, in different ways.\r\nToday, we face a new scenario. Perhaps as never\r\nbefore, all of us, and hence the United Nations, have a\r\ncommon goal: to respond to terrorism, irrespective of\r\nboundaries, ideologies, religions, races and cultures.\r\nThat commitment, undertaken with responsibility,\r\ninvolves taking every possible action without ever\r\nforgetting the higher goal: peace, whose supreme\r\nguarantee must continue to be international law and the\r\nconventions and treaties to which we are parties.\r\nBut there is no doubt that such a commitment is\r\nnot enough. We must fight every form of terrorism at\r\nevery level, domestic and international, and on every\r\nfront — legal, military, security and intelligence,\r\nadministrative and management. This demands of us\r\nstrong conviction, confidence in our shared values,\r\nfaith in humankind and the affirmation of life as the\r\nhighest value.\r\nTerrorism is blind and wicked by definition.\r\nBlind because it does not conceive or communicate\r\ngoals shared by the rest and so plunges into\r\nirrationality. Wicked because it indiscriminately\r\ndestroys people and property and sows fear, anxiety\r\nand sometimes panic.\r\nNevertheless, to fight it it will also be necessary\r\nto move against other enemies of peace, such as\r\npoverty and underdevelopment, to give every person\r\ngood reason to live and to make all of us guardians of\r\nhumankind, which is a common good from which no\r\none must feel excluded, and for which we must fight\r\nunwaveringly.\r\nThere is no cause or banner that could justify this\r\nviolence. That is precisely why we must prevent\r\nmarginalization, helplessness and desperation from\r\ntaking root in people’s souls so that they look\r\napprovingly and complacently on the criminal actions\r\nof which we are victims.\r\nOur task, then, is to galvanize everyone’s spirit in\r\nthe struggle against terrorism, because terrorism not\r\nonly fails to help solve the problems afflicting society\r\nas a whole but also fills it with fear and plunges it into\r\nparalysis and confusion.\r\nWe move with ever greater determination towards\r\na world and, consequently, towards a society that is\r\nevidently more and more globalized. The events of 11\r\nSeptember demonstrate that very clearly. Every people\r\nand every Government has been affected by those\r\nevents.\r\nWe are all involved in what happens, in a more\r\nprofound way than ever, because what happened not\r\nonly affects the security of the people; it raises\r\nquestions that are much simpler, but the answers to\r\nwhich are complex: what are all of our lives going to\r\nbe like from now on? What is the life of my family\r\ngoing to be like? Of my children? Of my parents? And\r\nof the others, my neighbours, my friends? How will the\r\nsimple acts of my life change? Will I be able to travel,\r\nreceive letters, use transportation and cross bridges —\r\nwithout second thoughts, as was natural to us before?\r\nThis world and, in particular, the United Nations\r\nface a challenge for which they are not duly prepared.\r\nWe have created the technological and communication\r\nmeans to unify the planet and globalize it. But we\r\nneither know how nor have the proper instruments to\r\nproperly manage this process.\r\nWe are living through an amazing revolution, and\r\nit must be guided — driving it forward if it stalls,\r\nlimiting it if it goes too far — in order to achieve the\r\ngoals enabling the structuring of a new, balanced\r\ninternational system that takes into account the changes\r\nthat have occurred for humankind over the last 50\r\nyears.\r\nThe United Nations was born as a response to a\r\nworld that today no longer exists. The instruments and\r\ninstitutions it created in the past were a response to\r\npast realities — replaced today by new realities — in\r\nthe political, demographic, cultural, religious and\r\necological spheres.\r\nAll the many countries that make up this global\r\nsociety and that, together, navigate through space, have\r\nthe obligation of confronting this new reality, drawing\r\non our diversity.\r\nUruguay, a small country, but one with a long\r\ninternational tradition — it was a participant in the\r\n1907 Hague Conference to implement arbitration as the\r\nmethod for resolving conflicts, a member of the League\r\nof Nations and a founding Member of the United\r\nNations in San Francisco — feels that this is our\r\ncurrent situation, and we are ready to shoulder our due\r\nshare of responsibility.\r\nIn the past, we created international financial and\r\nmonetary institutions, and others for international\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\ntrade, such as the World Trade Organization, which is\r\nmeeting today in Doha. All these institutions govern\r\nour activities and determine what we must do. But they\r\nnever act in concert. While the world is global, their\r\ndecisions are sectoral or singular.\r\nWhile loans are granted to us or fiscal or\r\nmonetary adjustments are required of us, the doors to\r\nmarkets do not at the same time open to our products\r\nand our labour. This way, instead of participating in the\r\nprocess of globalization, we are closed in nearly sealed\r\ncompartments. Those who have attained a certain level\r\nof growth grow even more, while the rest, save a few\r\nexceptions, suffer losses and fall further away from the\r\nlevels that would make it possible to enjoy the\r\nnecessary prosperity.\r\nToday the planet has 6 billion inhabitants. Only\r\n1.1 billion of them live in developed areas. In 2050, not\r\nlong from now — my grandchildren will not yet have\r\nreached my age — the planet will have 9.3 billion\r\ninhabitants, but still only 1.1 billion will live in\r\ndeveloped areas.\r\nPoverty not only destroys democracy. What is\r\nworse, it destroys societies and paves the way for\r\nviolence and, as we have often seen, even in our midst,\r\nall forms of terrorism.\r\nFinally, we consider it appropriate to repeat that\r\nwe are far from holding the answer necessary for the\r\nworld we have created.\r\nWe might not have spoken aloud these thoughts\r\nthat assuredly many of us have always had, had it not\r\nbeen for the thousands of innocent women and men\r\nthat died on that ill-fated 11 September. We owe to\r\nthem — whom Americans will always remember with\r\nlove and grief, feelings we also share — our most\r\nimportant responsibility: to see to it that they did not\r\ndie in vain.\r\nTheir tragic fate has shown us our duty. Now it is\r\ntime to do it.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Jorge Batlle Ibáñez, President of the Eastern\r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Fernando de la Rúa, President of the\r\nArgentine Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Argentine Republic.\r\nMr. Fernando de la Rúa, President of the\r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Fernando de la Rúa,\r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident de la Rúa (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. We are\r\nespecially pleased that the designation went to a\r\npersonality with such a remarkable career, a\r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea, a country that\r\nmaintains a friendly relationship and intense\r\ncooperation with Argentina. I also wish to\r\nacknowledge the excellent way in which the Foreign\r\nMinister of Finland, Mr. Harri Holkeri, presided over\r\nthe Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.\r\nI would also like to express our satisfaction at the\r\nre-election of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor a second term. This reflects the unanimous support\r\nof the international community for the way in which he\r\nhas decisively confronted the great challenges of peace,\r\nthe rule of law and development at this very difficult\r\nstage of international life. The support given to him by\r\nthe Member States reflects the widespread high opinion\r\nof his efforts and the work of the Organization, which\r\nwas confirmed by the Nobel Peace Prize, a distinction\r\nthat brings honour to those who work in the service of\r\nthe United Nations and to its clear-sighted Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThis distinction also comes at a moment when the\r\nfull relevance of the United Nations has become\r\ndramatically urgent as a result of the criminal attacks\r\nagainst the United States of 11 September. In the face\r\nof those events, I wish to reiterate our solidarity and\r\ncommitment with its Government and people. It was an\r\nattack against us all, against all humankind.\r\nThose events have shown that terrorism can strike\r\nat any State and that no country can fight it in isolation.\r\nIt is an international threat, and the only existing\r\ninstitution with the global reach, the United Nations,\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nmust confront that threat within the political and legal\r\nframework established by the Organization.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration had already set as\r\none of its objectives the adoption of concerted\r\nmeasures against international terrorism and the need\r\nfor all States to accede as soon as possible to all the\r\nrelevant international conventions. The adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\r\n(2001) and of General Assembly resolution 56/1 shows\r\nthat the United Nations has been equal to the\r\ncircumstances, with the goal of using every means\r\navailable to counter the threat to peace and security\r\nrepresented by terrorism.\r\nThe global effort against terrorism is an\r\nimperative for the international community, one\r\nblessed by the United Nations. Within the guidelines\r\napproved by the Organization, all States, groups of\r\nStates or regional organizations must contribute to this\r\ncommon struggle.\r\nArgentina expresses its full commitment to the\r\nfight against terrorism. Our nation has twice suffered\r\nattacks of this nature, in 1992 and 1994. The memory\r\nof those events helps us to understand the grief for\r\ninnocent victims and to say that this fight is also our\r\nfight.\r\nThe recent Security Council and General\r\nAssembly resolutions have been supplemented by other\r\ninstruments that reflect the will of the majority of\r\nStates to define any terrorist act, without exception, as\r\ncriminal and unjustifiable, no matter what the intended\r\npurposes. Existing resolutions and conventions have\r\noutlined a series of specific measures and rules to\r\nfoster judicial and police cooperation and have\r\ncriminalized many acts of terrorism, enshrining the\r\nprinciple that all States have an obligation to prosecute\r\nand punish the perpetrators.\r\nArgentina is a party to the majority of the\r\ninternational treaties in effect and is making progress\r\non ratifying the remainder, among them the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings, of 1997, and the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism, of 1999. We support the conclusion of the\r\nconventions currently under consideration that should\r\nbe finalized before the end of this year, such as the\r\nconvention on nuclear terrorism. I hope that the\r\nnegotiations on a convention of a general nature will be\r\nsuccessfully concluded. The existence of political\r\ndifferences or different interpretations related to other\r\nsituations should not distract us from the urgent need to\r\ndevelop an instrument that would encompass all\r\naspects of this threat.\r\nAt the level of the hemisphere, we have put into\r\npractice the regional system of legitimate defence and\r\ncollective security established in the Inter-American\r\nTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance. At the same time, we\r\nhave fostered the full operation of the Inter-American\r\nCommittee on Terrorism and the drafting of an inter-\r\nAmerican convention, that complements existing\r\nuniversal conventions, as well as the convening of a\r\nspecial conference on hemispheric security.\r\nAt the regional level, the countries of the\r\nSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR) are\r\npromoting measures to enhance technical and\r\noperational coordination, cooperation and assistance\r\namong the various agencies entrusted with the fight\r\nagainst terrorism in the field.\r\nWe must be aware that the approach to this\r\nproblem will be incomplete if we fail to recognize the\r\nfactors that nourish terrorism. In the framework of the\r\nincreasing interdependence that characterizes the\r\npresent stage of economic life, the benefits of\r\ndevelopment reach only a few States, and the\r\nincreasing marginalization of countries and societies\r\nthat live in extreme poverty, the tragedy of neglected or\r\nundernourished children, sickness and hunger become\r\nmore evident. This uneven economic distribution, made\r\neven more tangible by modern communications, causes\r\nfrustration in wide sectors of the dispossessed and\r\ncreates the conditions for the outbreak of conflicts and\r\nconfrontations, on which fundamentalist movements of\r\nvarious kinds are at work. This is why we need to\r\nreaffirm here the fundamental statement made a few\r\nyears ago by Pope Paul VI: “the new name for peace is\r\ndevelopment”.\r\nThis is a task for the international community as a\r\nwhole, in a joint effort and a spirit of solidarity. It is\r\nwrong to minimize the importance of international\r\ncooperation and to leave on their own those who have\r\nproblems surviving in the face of global economic\r\ncompetition.\r\nThe launching of a new round of negotiations at\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) could be an\r\nimportant signal to control the increasingly\r\nprotectionist tendencies and to promote world\r\neconomic recovery in the short term and growth in the\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nlong term. It is a signal that will also bring additional\r\nconfidence to the financial markets. Through the\r\nlaunching of a new round in Qatar, the 142 member\r\ncountries of the WTO could give impetus to a process\r\nthat lays the foundations for a more equitable and\r\npeaceful world.\r\nThe persistence of conflicts such as the one in the\r\nMiddle East is a source of tension, with a wide range of\r\nrepercussions for the region, causing legitimate\r\nconcern for the international community. The\r\nArgentine Republic wishes to renew its expression of\r\nsupport for a stable and lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast, based on respect for the inalienable right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to\r\nestablish an independent State, as well as recognition\r\nof the right of the State of Israel to live in peace within\r\nsafe and internationally recognized borders.\r\nViolence and terrorism in any form are absolutely\r\nunacceptable and can only exacerbate the situation.\r\nThe parties should urgently agree on a ceasefire and\r\nbegin negotiations on a final settlement, which until\r\nrecently seemed reachable.\r\nThe Secretary-General has offered us a road map\r\nfor implementing the Millennium Declaration, which\r\nprovides a responsible programme for confronting our\r\ncurrent serious circumstances. The principal milestones\r\nof that road map deserve our support as a sound way\r\ntowards peace-building and strengthening our security:\r\nthe rule of law to fight terrorism with determination;\r\nconflict prevention and the strengthening of\r\npeacekeeping operations; the reform of sanctions\r\nregimes in order to avoid affecting civilian\r\npopulations; the eradication of poverty and the\r\npromotion of development; respect for fundamental\r\nhuman rights throughout the world and for political and\r\nreligious plurality; and the firm rejection of any\r\nattempt to associate certain religious creeds or\r\nnationalities with violence or terrorism.\r\nWe also share the Secretary-General’s view of the\r\nimportance of putting an end to the culture of impunity\r\nby bringing to trial the perpetrators of extremely\r\nserious international crimes. We underscore the\r\nhistorical importance of the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court and we reaffirm our\r\nsupport for measures to promote its prompt launching.\r\nThe great majority of humankind desires a future\r\nof peace and progress. The irrationality and violence of\r\na minority can be isolated and defeated on the basis of\r\ncooperation among nations following these general\r\nprinciples, which we endorsed in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, and in regard to which we propose\r\nconcrete measures today. We trust that we shall be up\r\nto that challenge.\r\nI cannot conclude without recalling, as the\r\nGeneral Assembly already knows, that the Argentine\r\nRepublic is still engaged in a sovereignty dispute with\r\nthe United Kingdom over the Malvinas, South Georgias\r\nand South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding\r\nmaritime areas. The recovery of the full exercise of\r\nsovereignty over that part of our national territory,\r\nrespecting the interests of their inhabitants and\r\ninternational law, is a precept enshrined in our\r\nConstitution. This issue is on the agenda of this\r\nOrganization, which through repeated resolutions has\r\nasked the Governments of Argentina and the United\r\nKingdom to resume negotiations on a just and lasting\r\nsolution to the sovereignty dispute and thus to put an\r\nend to a colonial situation imposed by force in 1833.\r\nToday, in response to that request, Argentina\r\nagain reiterates its full readiness to resume bilateral\r\nnegotiations with the United Kingdom in order to\r\nresolve the issue, as well as its support for the mission\r\nof good offices appropriately entrusted to the\r\nSecretary-General by the General Assembly to assist\r\nthe parties in achieving that goal.\r\nI conclude by calling for peace, justice and\r\nsolidarity, so widely sought by all peoples defending\r\nlife throughout the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nArgentine Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Fernando de la Rúa, President of the\r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías,\r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Chávez Frías (spoke in Spanish): Just\r\nover a year ago, we were here, attending the\r\nMillennium Summit, some 100 days before the dawn of\r\nthe twenty-first century. At that time, I made a\r\nstatement on behalf of Venezuela and its Bolivarian\r\npeople, referring to the supreme example of Christ and\r\nhis struggle for justice, peace and life.\r\nIn the brief span of time since then, having\r\nembarked on the new century — albeit with very\r\npainful steps, I should say — we have suffered the\r\nabominable terrorist attack of 11 September. In\r\nopposition to the culture of peace, to the dialogue\r\namong civilizations declared by the United Nations in\r\n2001 and to the good will of the peoples of the world,\r\nthe drums of war are suddenly thundering again and we\r\nsay, louder and more passionately than we have in the\r\npast, that this struggle for peace is of fundamental\r\nimportance.\r\nFrom the outset, Venezuela and its people,\r\nGovernment and institutions have joined in the chorus\r\nof voices that first rose to reject these heinous acts. At\r\nthis meeting in New York, in this incredible city, in this\r\nnation of North America, we take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate our grief and sympathy for the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States and its institutions\r\nover the attacks and the pain they have caused. We say,\r\nas we have said from the very day of the tragedy that\r\nhas plunged the world into mourning and peril, that the\r\nfight against terrorism should become a war against\r\nwar — a fight to achieve peace.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, we also said, like\r\nSimón Bolívar, the liberator of South America,\r\nremembering his dream of the summit of Chimborazo:\r\nLet us speak the truth to all men and women. And\r\nprecisely on the basis of the horrible and frightful\r\ntruths that we are experiencing today in the world, let\r\nus call for a new world pact in the United Nations. We\r\nsaid in that speech just over one year ago that at the\r\npresent time in our world human beings continue to die\r\neach day, but now the figures have doubled, and not\r\nbecause of a world war. No, now the principal causes\r\nof the horrible truth affecting the world’s people are\r\npoverty, marginalization and hunger. What is foremost\r\nin this dramatic and tragic moment is that we must\r\nrecognize the truth and then build a new global pact in\r\nthe United Nations without delay.\r\nNow, at the beginning of the twenty-first century\r\nand the third millennium, we at the United Nations\r\nshould concentrate our greatest possible efforts on the\r\nmoral, intellectual, scientific, social, cultural, economic\r\nand financial order in the fight against the demons of\r\nhunger, poverty and death that afflict the planet. This is\r\nwhat we said a year ago in this beautiful setting. I\r\nbelieve we are fulfilling the mandate of Bolívar to state\r\nthe truth to all men and women.\r\nVenezuela recognized the validity, the necessity,\r\nthe great vision and the truth that our Secretary-\r\nGeneral launched as a challenge to all of us in the\r\npreparatory document that subsequently became the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Today, our dear friend Kofi\r\nAnnan reminded us of that challenge in his comments\r\nopening this session of debates, when he recalled, for\r\nexample, that last year we committed ourselves to\r\nreducing poverty 50 per cent by the year 2015, having\r\nset quantifiable and precise goals, such as reducing by\r\nhalf the number of human beings who survive on\r\nincomes of less than one dollar per day.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, great truths were\r\nstated and we heard the appeals of our peoples. We said\r\nthen and continue to say that all of the world’s children\r\nmust have access to a full education by the year 2015.\r\nAs the Secretary-General also reminded us, all human\r\nbeings should have access to potable water. We are not\r\ntalking about the Internet — we are talking about\r\ndrinking water, the water basic to life.\r\nThe goals set last year were discussed over the\r\nfollowing weeks in hundreds of marvellous speeches.\r\nBut today, one year later, we must continue to ask\r\nourselves how we are going to achieve them. What are\r\nthe successful strategies that can be employed to\r\nachieve these lofty goals? The answer is justice, the\r\nonly path to true peace. We said that we had come to\r\nuncover truths; that for the honour, dignity and life of\r\nour peoples, we must come here to speak without fear.\r\nWe said that here, in this setting, we must speak\r\nwithout the double standard that sometimes invades our\r\ndiscussions. As I see our brothers from India here, I\r\nthink of the Hindu philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti,\r\nwho spoke of truth as a basic dynamic in understanding\r\nthe secrets of life. Truth, truth, truth. We want truths. If\r\nwe do not recognize truths, it will be difficult for us to\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nfind true solutions to the horrible tragedies that the\r\nworld is living through.\r\nOn behalf of the people of Venezuela, I return\r\nhere today to contribute ideas to the effort to seek\r\ntruths and to speak true words that spring from a\r\ncombination of reason and passion. They are not just\r\ncold words on paper but come from the heart, and they\r\nmust not remain on paper as cold discourse but must\r\ntouch the wound of real truth. Today, truth is an open\r\nwound and it is our ultimate challenge to heal it. We\r\ncome, then, without fear, in good faith and with much\r\noptimism about life, brotherhood, unity and the\r\npossibility that we, as the leaders of our countries, can\r\nseek, grasp and build together real solutions to real\r\nproblems in the quest for justice and peace.\r\nWe in Venezuela believe that the world must be\r\nexamined under a great and powerful magnifying glass,\r\nbecause it has gone to bad to worse, stumbling and\r\nstruggling from error to error. At the end of the Second\r\nWorld War, the United Nations was born to struggle for\r\npeace and prevent new horrors from happening. We\r\nhave not avoided those horrors. The Berlin Wall and\r\nthe Soviet Union fell at the end of the twentieth\r\ncentury, and voices were raised saying history has\r\ncome to an end: we have arrived at the end of our path,\r\nthe final era, one of technology, of the global village,\r\nof globalization, of the new world order. This is the\r\ntriumph of a model — the triumph of one philosophy\r\nas the result of the collapse of another. But that claim\r\nwas a lie. Who can claim victory in today’s world,\r\nwhich is filled with poverty and tears, pain and death?\r\nWhat model could claim victory?\r\nVenezuela would like to make a fervent and\r\npassionate appeal, hopeful that we will be properly\r\nunderstood — indeed, we are sure that we will be,\r\nbecause we are speaking with love, faith and hope,\r\ncalling on the Lord God, invoking life and peace and\r\nrespect for brotherhood. Let our words be properly\r\nunderstood. We must undertake a thorough\r\nexamination of and review the political models that\r\nexist in our countries today. In America we speak of\r\ndemocracy — yes, democracy. But in Venezuela we ask\r\nwhat kind of democracy we are talking about. A\r\ndemocracy such as Venezuela had for 40 years, from\r\n1958 to 1998, which ended up destroying a people,\r\ntaking away their sovereignty and causing them to live\r\nin poverty in a fertile land rich with resources such as\r\noil and gold? That was no more than an ornamental\r\nflourish that mimicked democracy, and it ended in\r\ntyranny. We never again want such a democracy in\r\nVenezuela, and we are certain that we will never have\r\nit again. Democracy must be based on popular\r\nparticipation, ethics, justice and equality.\r\nWe in Venezuela have been saying that we must\r\nalso review the economic models that some tried to put\r\nin place among our peoples. Is neoliberalism the way?\r\nYes — it is the way to hell. Let us traverse the streets\r\nand cities of Latin America and we will see the\r\nconsequences of neoliberal policies run wild, as His\r\nHoliness John Paul II has said. We must review our\r\neconomies, our ethics, our policies — everything must\r\nbe re-examined today if we want the world to be a\r\nviable place and if we want peace to reign on earth.\r\nIs globalization the path to development? It could\r\nbe, if it were based on justice, equality and respectful\r\nrelations among all. We need to re-examine everything.\r\nAs Viviane Forrester said, using the phrase “economic\r\nhorror”, the world is undergoing a process of change,\r\nand that should also be cause for optimism. The world\r\nis changing; it is moving on. New developments are\r\ntaking place; let us move with them, peacefully and\r\ndemocratically, while searching for justice. As Ignacio\r\nRamonet said in his reflections in Le Monde\r\nDiplomatique, alternative paths are appearing all over\r\nthe world. Venezuela is making its humble contribution\r\nthrough a peaceful and democratic revolution. We are\r\ncommitted to the human being, to an international\r\npolicy of peace, friendship, respect and multipolarity.\r\nAnd we are here today to reaffirm that commitment.\r\nVenezuela is speaking out in condemning\r\nterrorism. Venezuela is speaking out — and taking\r\naction — in expressing its solidarity in the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism. At the same time, in speaking out we\r\nare giving voice to the mandate of the United Nations\r\nto ensure respect for international law and human\r\nrights. Any action taken against any crime must be\r\nlegitimate. It must be based on respect for human rights\r\nand international law. No one should understand\r\nVenezuela’s words to be a condemnation of anything or\r\nanyone. We are calling for reflection so as to ensure\r\nthat we act within the norms of international law and\r\nthe mandates of the United Nations. We cannot throw\r\nthat overboard.\r\nVenezuela has also shouldered its responsibility\r\nin various forums and international arenas. Within the\r\nOrganization of American States, we are proposing that\r\na social charter be adopted, in addition to the\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nDemocratic Charter, to give more weight to our\r\ncontinent’s struggles to place the human being at the\r\nforefront of our endeavours. Within the Organization of\r\nPetroleum Exporting Countries, of which we hold the\r\npresidency of the conference of heads of State, we\r\nproposed — and achieved consensus among all — to\r\nensure balance and dialogue between the producers and\r\nconsumers of oil, aware as we are of the need to\r\nguarantee supplies and a fair price for all for that vital\r\nresource for development and for life.\r\nWithin the Group of Fifteen, Venezuela, which\r\nholds the chairmanship, is promoting the North-South\r\ndialogue, in particular the need to revitalize it. It\r\nshould not be a dialogue of the deaf, but a dialogue of\r\nequals who are seeking solutions — dialogue and\r\ncooperation of South with South and of Latin American\r\nand the Caribbean with Africa, Asia and all the peoples\r\nof the world. Within the Group of 77, Venezuela is\r\nworking for the same strategic consensus, dialogue and\r\nunity. We are very optimistic, as everyone should be.\r\nDespite everything, however, we need great\r\npolitical will — greater political will — to bring about\r\nall of those changes and transformations. To use the\r\nvocabulary of the theory of war, we must put the\r\ncavalry on the front line. The cavalry is policy; the\r\ncavalry is ethics and the will for change, which we\r\nmust promote.\r\nFinally, I believe that, over and above the pain,\r\nthe condemnation and the struggle against terrorism\r\nand against the savages who perpetrated those horrific\r\nattacks, the greatest honour must go to the fallen — the\r\ninnocent victims of those acts, and the many other\r\nvictims throughout the world, those who have suffered\r\nand for whom we have wept: the innocent children who\r\nhave fallen, the men and the women. The British Prime\r\nMinister, Tony Blair, said something that I thought was\r\nwonderful in response to a comment that I made during\r\na conversation we had in Downing Street a few days\r\nago. He said that if anything good can come from this\r\ncrisis and this pain, it is a global alliance to combat the\r\ncauses of violence throughout the world.\r\nThose who have spoken before me have pointed\r\nout many of these causes. The Emir of Qatar and\r\nChairman of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference also made a very important point. He said\r\nthat our words should not once again remain empty. As\r\nwe say in our part of the world, there is a big difference\r\nbetween words and action. Now is the time to move\r\ntowards concrete action. We want to see a Palestinian\r\nState become a reality. Let us not come here day after\r\nday, month after month and year after year just to\r\nrepeat the same old words. Let us move on towards\r\nreality. We want to see the transformation of the\r\nBretton Woods institutions. We want to see the\r\ntransformation of the International Monetary Fund and\r\nthe World Bank. We want justice for the wretched of\r\nthe Earth, as Frantz Fanon said. But we want it now,\r\nnot tomorrow; tomorrow may be too late.\r\nIn conclusion, as I said during the debate on 7\r\nSeptember last year, quoting from the Bible,\r\n“To everything there is a season, and a time\r\nto every purpose under the heaven”. (The Holy\r\nBible, Ecclesiastes 3:1)\r\nSisters and brothers of this planet in sorrow, of this our\r\nworld, let us do all that we can. Truly, we must\r\ntransform this difficult time in which we are living into\r\na time of the people, a time of justice; that is the only\r\nway to achieve genuine peace. As I ended by saying\r\nlast year, let us save the world!\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ricardo Lagos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Chile\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile.\r\nMr. Ricardo Lagos, President of the Republic of\r\nChile, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ricardo Lagos, President\r\nof the Republic of Chile, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Lagos (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMr. President, I wish to congratulate you on your\r\nelection, which is a mark of recognition of the\r\nRepublic of Korea and of your distinguished personal\r\nrecord in the public and academic spheres. I am\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nconfident that, under your guidance, the work of the\r\nAssembly will be successful for the States Members of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nToday New York is receiving us as it always has.\r\nWhy, then, did we witness, two months ago, a terrorist\r\nact that shook the world? If I may be allowed to say so,\r\nit is because New York is the city that best represents\r\nthe values that the twentieth century defended at the\r\ncost of tremendous suffering. It is a city that welcomes\r\nthose persecuted by intolerance of all kinds; respects\r\nall nationalities, races and religions, all ideas, and the\r\nfreedom to think and to create; offers opportunities for\r\nall to succeed; and protects individual rights through\r\ndemocracy.\r\nIt is not by chance that it was here in New York,\r\non the banks of the East River, that the Headquarters of\r\nthe United Nations was erected. It was built here\r\nbecause the values of this city are the values of our\r\nuniversal Organization of nations.\r\nThe terrorist attack on New York was therefore an\r\nattack on the unity of our nations. It was our values,\r\nour security and our faith in a better world — a world\r\nbased on dialogue and cooperation — that were the\r\ntargets of terrorist fanaticism. That is why we have felt\r\nso close to the United States during this period: its pain\r\nis our pain; its grief is our grief; and its response to\r\nterrorism is our response.\r\nWe are here to reiterate our condolences to the\r\npeople and to the Government of the United States. The\r\nsight of thousands of persons bearing photographs of\r\ntheir lost family members amid the smoking ruins gave\r\nrise to a profound sense of empathy among Chileans.\r\nHence we wish to express our admiration for the\r\nunity and courage of the American people and of the\r\ncity of New York. We pay tribute to the Government of\r\nthe United States and to President Bush, who, faced\r\nwith an attack of this magnitude, has managed to act on\r\nthe basis of reason rather than emotion in seeking\r\ndiplomatic support and in building an extremely broad-\r\nbased coalition.\r\nThe holding of this General Assembly marks a\r\nsound defeat for the terrorist cause, which seeks to\r\nreplace dialogue with the cult of violence, and reflects\r\nour renewed faith in this world forum.\r\nWe are here to extend to the Secretary-General\r\nand to the United Nations our warmest congratulations\r\non having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which\r\nthis year has recognized the outstanding contribution of\r\nthe United Nations to our quest for peace.\r\nMany have remarked that the twentieth century\r\nhas been one of the most violent and deadly in the\r\nhistory of humankind. However, the twentieth century\r\nwas also the century that produced major advances,\r\nimproved our quality of life and eliminated great evils\r\nforever.\r\nThe First World War was followed by the League\r\nof Nations and by a new awareness of the fundamental\r\nequality of peoples. The Second World War was\r\nnecessary to put an end to fascism in its most\r\nmonstrous manifestations, but also out of it emerged\r\nthe United Nations, the decolonization process, the\r\nBretton Woods economic agreements and a new\r\nawareness of the fundamental equality of human\r\nbeings. The cold war brought about a clash between\r\ntwo political and economic visions, but, once ended, it\r\nleft in its wake a new awareness of democracy and\r\nindividual freedoms.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, we are\r\nconfronting a new conflict of global proportions. Our\r\nfirst objective must be to put an end forever to\r\nfanaticism and to the kind of intolerance that is\r\ntranslated into terror.\r\nChile believes that this vast diplomatic alliance\r\nmust also pursue other objectives. Like other victorious\r\ncoalitions throughout history, it must begin to ask now\r\nwhat new progress it will seek to achieve for humanity\r\nafter its victory. We must start to envision the new\r\nworld that must emerge from this tragic period in our\r\nhistory — a world that is better organized and that\r\nshows more solidarity. Indeed, the terrorists will have\r\nachieved their objective if, as a result of their attacks,\r\nthe globalization process changes direction and begins\r\na trend towards less freedom and decreased\r\ninternational trade.\r\nOn the other hand, as the Secretary-General has\r\nso rightly said, in order to achieve success in the\r\nglobalization process, we must learn how to manage it\r\nbetter and, above all, how to manage it better together.\r\nI think that it is very important to understand that\r\nof the 6 billion people in the world, half are struggling\r\nto live on less than $2 a day. They have no personal\r\ncomputer; they have never made a telephone call. They\r\nhave never seen these things. Though wealth has\r\nincreased, there has been no significant decrease in the\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nnumber of poor people, and the gap between rich and\r\npoor is daily becoming increasingly difficult to bridge.\r\nThe balance of our world is becoming precarious, and\r\nwe must address this issue.\r\nThe recent tragic events have shown us that no\r\nnation on earth that can consider itself invulnerable and\r\nthat genuine security can be attained only through\r\ncooperation among peoples and States. What makes\r\nour citizens vulnerable today — besides terrorism —\r\nare such phenomena as ignorance, hunger, drug\r\ntrafficking, climate change, uncontrolled population\r\nmovements, and the erratic flow of $1.5 trillion every\r\nday in financial markets. We must devise ways of\r\ntackling these phenomena.\r\nChile therefore supports the coalition of countries\r\nthat, in exercise of the right of self-defence, have\r\nembarked on a campaign aimed at eradicating\r\nterrorism. At stake here are the universal principles and\r\nvalues that we share and that we must defend. These\r\nactions, therefore, are not targeting the Afghan people\r\nor the Arab world, nor are they aimed at any particular\r\nreligion, all of which we deeply respect and admire.\r\nIn order to put an end to terrorism, there is a need\r\nfor broad, ongoing and resolute cooperation. That is\r\nwhy Chile has supported the responses decided upon in\r\nthis Organization. We are actively implementing\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). We are\r\nalready a party to the 12 global conventions against\r\nterrorism, and today we will deposit with the\r\nSecretary-General the respective instruments of\r\nratification. My country has ratified all United Nations\r\nagreements.\r\nSimilarly, we are working to coordinate\r\nAmerica’s response. We are partners in a\r\ncomprehensive dialogue to review and improve each\r\ncountry’s domestic legislation and legal order to root\r\nout the terrorist threat.\r\nWe reaffirm the need to strengthen measures to\r\npromote mutual confidence and cooperation in the area\r\nof defence. In that regard, Argentina and Chile have\r\nstandardized their data on military expenditures, and\r\nwe are working towards the same objective with our\r\nneighbour Peru.\r\nYet we cannot conceal our frustration at the\r\ndifficulties blocking progress towards limiting the\r\nmanufacture of and illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons.\r\nWe also feel obliged to say that we view with\r\nhorror the deteriorating situation in the Middle East.\r\nThat conflict poses a threat to international security.\r\nLike other delegations that have spoken today, we hope\r\nfor recognition of the inalienable right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination, including the\r\nright to establish an independent State, as well as the\r\nright of Israel to live within secure and internationally\r\nrecognized borders and at peace with its neighbours.\r\nRecent acts of international terrorism have\r\naffected our economies, which are the basis for social\r\nprogress for our peoples. Fear has gripped the markets.\r\nThe only certainty today is that uncertainty will prevail\r\nin the future so long as there is armed action because of\r\nthis conflict. If that proves to be the case, and if\r\ninternational markets fall, terrorism will have achieved\r\nan unexpected victory.\r\nI therefore want to say that institutions such as\r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\r\nmust address the concerns of the international political\r\nbodies and devote special attention to the additional\r\ncosts of the response to terrorism. We are confident of\r\nsuccess at the Doha, Qatar, ministerial meeting, which\r\nwill be discussing ways to make trade freer. We want to\r\naddress items of concern to all: agricultural products,\r\nservices, intellectual property, anti-dumping and the\r\nsettlement of trade disputes. They are all on the\r\nagenda, and they must all be addressed.\r\nThe great coalition assembled to combat\r\nterrorism must also promote cooperation among\r\nGovernments in order to ensure that no areas are\r\nexcluded from globalization. That is the best way to\r\nguarantee security for us all. To create a safer world,\r\nwe need more and better globalization, not more\r\nautarky. We need more and better democracy, not more\r\ndictatorial authoritarianism. We must do a better job of\r\nprotecting human rights. Here, I believe we must act\r\npreventively to safeguard our democracies and to\r\nensure respect for human rights.\r\nDemocracy is strengthened with each free and\r\nsecret election with the participation of an informed\r\nelectorate. It is strengthened with higher levels of\r\njustice and social equality. To restore people’s\r\nconfidence in democracy, democracy must be\r\ncomplemented by an end to social injustice. Neither\r\nlack of development nor specific cultural\r\ncharacteristics can be used as a pretext to justify\r\ncurtailing rights recognized in the Universal\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. The fight against\r\ndiscrimination and intolerance must be a frontal attack\r\non poverty.\r\nWe need institutions that ensure respect for\r\nhuman rights. Hence the importance of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, which should serve as an\r\nkey instrument for the universal protection of\r\nfundamental human rights, whatever the status of the\r\nviolator.\r\nI have come from afar, from the South of the\r\nworld, with an optimistic vision. Before leaving my\r\ncountry, I met with young people of varied origins and\r\nwith dignitaries of different religions. I met with\r\nCatholic and Protestant bishops; with Jewish and\r\nMuslim representatives: all those with whom we share\r\nan annual joint religious service — unique in the\r\nworld — to celebrate our national independence. I saw\r\nin all of them — Jews and Muslims; Catholics,\r\nProtestants and freethinkers — a renewed capacity for\r\nunderstanding and comprehension that I am sure is\r\nshared among western and eastern countries, among\r\nethnic groups and religions — in short, among all those\r\nhere today — with the objective of attaining our\r\ncommon objective of peace and progress.\r\nLet us learn from our experience in assembling\r\nthis great global coalition to respond politically and\r\nmilitarily to the terrorist threat. Let us make it into a\r\ncoalition that also seeks other goals. In this coalition,\r\nall are important, irrespective of creed, race, political\r\nhistory or ideology; in the coalition there are no small\r\nor large countries.\r\nLet us ensure that international institutions take\r\ndue account of the interests of all countries, large,\r\nmedium-sized and small. Let us ensure that this grand\r\ncoalition will bring us security not only against\r\nterrorism but also against hunger, vulnerability and\r\ndiscrimination. I propose that we should update the\r\ninstitutions that the founders of the United Nations\r\ncreated here 50 years ago.\r\nThat would be the most fitting tribute to the\r\nvictims of terrorism and the best gauge of our\r\ncommitment to the weak and powerless of the Earth.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Chile for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ricardo Lagos, President of the Republic of\r\nChile, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami,\r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran.\r\nMr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Seyed Mohammad\r\nKhatami, President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Khatami (spoke in Farsi; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): At the outset, Sir, I would\r\nlike to congratulate you on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly. I would also like\r\nto express my appreciation for the wise and persistent\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General during the current\r\ncrucial world situation.\r\nHuman society stepped into the third millennium\r\nwith hopes and expectations. The United Nations\r\ndesignated the last year of the twentieth century as the\r\nInternational Year for the Culture of Peace and the first\r\nyear of the twenty-first century as the United Nations\r\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. Today, however,\r\nthe world faces immense tragedies and grave concerns.\r\nOne of the most brutal and savage manifestations of\r\nthis was the terrorist attack against the American\r\npeople.\r\nThe decisive, immediate and unequivocal global\r\ncondemnation of the terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nrepresents the emergence of a public attitude and\r\ncommon political will all over the world to counter\r\nterrorism in all its manifestations, irrespective of\r\nmotives, perpetrators or victims. The Leader of the\r\nIslamic Revolution of Iran spoke of the “jihad against\r\nthis evil phenomenon” so as to highlight the genuine\r\nview of Islam and the Islamic Revolution vis-à-vis\r\nterrorism and violence.\r\nImmediately after the carnage of 11 September,\r\nand in the name of the people and Government of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, I expressed sympathy with\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nthe American nation and all the victims of that criminal\r\nact. And in the first days of the tragedy, in a letter to\r\nthe Secretary-General, I underlined that,\r\n“Terrorism is the common problem of today’s\r\nworld. It threatens peace, liberty, spirituality,\r\nknowledge, culture and global coexistence. A\r\nsustainable solution to this hideous and dangerous\r\nphenomenon requires vision, serious political will\r\nand active participation and cooperation of all\r\nmembers of the human society.”\r\nThe threat of terrorism should not be\r\nunderestimated, nor should its devastating\r\nconsequences be measured only in the visible realm of\r\npolitics. Terrorism is the chronic menace of our era,\r\nrooted in the mentality of violence, the logic of might\r\nand the practice of injustice and discrimination. When\r\nspirituality, ethics and justice find no room in the\r\nrealms of politics, economics and culture, and when\r\ndiscrimination, marginalization, exclusion and the\r\napplication of double standards push justice aside, the\r\nworld is bound to face alienation, despair, extremism\r\nand lawlessness. In such a climate, terrorism finds\r\nfertile ground for growth.\r\nThe disaster in the United States is so tragic and\r\ngrave that thinkers are urgently called on to engage in\r\ndeep reflection and dialogue on its real causes. For\r\nmany years, our great thinkers have cautioned us to\r\navoid submission to instrumental reasoning, warning of\r\nthe threats and tragedies that it could generate.\r\nOn the other hand, some of the great thinkers of\r\nour time have ascribed atrocities such as fascism to the\r\nreign of mythological speculation. They have attributed\r\nthe emergence of fascism not to the expansion of\r\nrationality but to evading rationality and succumbing to\r\nthe reign of myth.\r\nThis does not mean that we will succumb to\r\nmythical speculation if we do not want to. We have the\r\nchoice not to negate rationality. But at the same time,\r\nwe must also combine rationality with empathy, the\r\nmind with the heart. Neither one can be without the\r\nother. Neither one can be neglected. If it is, it will lead\r\nto tragedy, no matter under what pretext, religion, race,\r\nnationalism or any other nation. The same mythical\r\nspeculation is seen in modern cult ideology, which is a\r\nform of rationality that is reduced to instrumental\r\nreasoning and thereby stripped of all its moral and\r\nhuman aspects. Religion, tradition, philosophy and art\r\ndescend to achieving only one goal, that of political\r\nends.\r\nOne of the most common features of these\r\nideologies, which is regrettably prevalent, is the\r\nglorification of the self and the demonization of\r\nopposing groups and ideas. The advocates of this\r\nideology in the West attribute to Islam, the religion of\r\nhumanity, compassion and justice, such labels as\r\nterrorism. In the same manner, in parts of the Islamic\r\nworld, the West is equated with suppression. Such\r\npolarization of the world and human beings would lead\r\nto horrifying political and security consequences for\r\nthe whole world.\r\nThe world has yet to overcome the horror and\r\ndisbelief caused by the malicious terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember against thousands of innocent people. At the\r\nsame time, the most destructive modern weapons are\r\nbeing used in one of the most deprived parts of the\r\nworld against an oppressed and dispossessed people.\r\nOnce again, history repeats its sad experience that war\r\ntriggers war.\r\nThe time is ripe for us to analyse the history and\r\nconsequences of exclusionary ways of acting, to\r\ninitiate ways to engage intellectuals from different\r\ncultures in dialogue and to encourage the public to\r\nembark upon learning for the sake of dialogue and\r\ndialogue for the sake of learning and to reinforce the\r\nart of listening as sacred and invaluable.\r\nAngry politicians should be prevented from\r\ntaking the initiative in ongoing developments. They\r\nshould be made to yield to the judgement of wisdom\r\nand fairness.\r\nThe American nation has experienced one of the\r\nmost brutal forms of terrorism, in which the blind\r\nhatred of terrorists has prevented the recovery of the\r\nbodies of the victims of the 11 September tragedy.\r\nToday, other nations walk hand in hand with the\r\nAmerican nation.\r\nToday, beyond mere rhetoric, one can see the\r\nconvergence of the ideas of the peoples of the United\r\nStates and Iran, who have also experienced, in earlier\r\ntimes, the mute but brutal massacre resulting from the\r\nuse of chemical weapons. This convergence of ideas\r\ncan also be discerned among all those refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons who are victims of war, suppression\r\nand terrorism — including State and non-State\r\nterrorism — in Afghanistan and Palestine.\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nWe must have empathy for the suffering of people\r\neverywhere: in occupied Palestine, oppressed\r\nAfghanistan, New York, Washington or any corner of\r\nthe globe.\r\nWe shall rise to the challenge of promoting peace,\r\nsecurity and development among all nations on the\r\nbasis of justice, and we believe that in today’s\r\ninterconnected world, we cannot live in islands of\r\nprosperity and progress while the rest of the world\r\nsuffers from increasing poverty, illiteracy, disease and\r\ninsecurity. Acquiescing to any act of terrorism,\r\nanywhere in the world, is inconsistent with any\r\nreligious or ethical principle. Likewise, resorting to\r\nviolence and revenge to counter such acts could hardly\r\nbe justified because of ethical and humane\r\nconsiderations. Lacing the sacred realm of religion\r\nwith violence and terror is a grave disservice to all\r\nreligions and their followers. The divine religions call\r\nfor peace, tolerance and compassion. They\r\nunequivocally repudiate — in essence and appearance\r\n— any thought or act of violence. I would like to quote\r\nthe late leader of the Islamic revolution, Imam\r\nKhomeini, who said that “as followers of Islam, we\r\nalways oppose war and desire peace and tranquillity\r\namong all States.”\r\nLet us accept that no country in the world is\r\nimmune to terrorism. We should therefore seek\r\nsolutions at the highest possible level.\r\nToday there is unprecedented momentum in the\r\nworld for combating terrorism, which should not be\r\nlost. To this end, the United Nations can arrange and\r\nguide a genuine and legitimate endeavour in the\r\ninternational fight against terrorism. The Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran is an active partner in this global\r\ncoalition and spares no effort for the success of the\r\ninternational community in uprooting terrorism through\r\nviable, just and non-discriminatory measures. By\r\narticulating a comprehensive definition of terrorism,\r\nthe United Nations can overcome one of the major\r\nhistorical hurdles to avoiding further misuse of that\r\nterm. The adoption of Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001) and its effective implementation by all States\r\ncan be considered a first step for a coordinated\r\ninternational campaign against terrorism. Moreover,\r\nnegotiations on the draft comprehensive convention on\r\nterrorism, based on internationally accepted definitions\r\nand principles, would provide an effective basis for\r\ncollective measures in this respect.\r\nThe 11 September attack indicated that the\r\ndivision between centre and periphery can no longer\r\ndefine the security order of the world today, for even\r\nthe most marginalized sectors might be able to inflict\r\nblows on the biggest Powers. This development has\r\ntaken on all the more threatening dimensions in the\r\nlight of the emergence of the dangerous phenomenon\r\nof bioterrorism.\r\nThe conflict-stricken regions of the world require\r\nurgent and comprehensive attention. After decades of\r\nwar, insecurity and destruction, Afghanistan needs\r\norder, law, security and stability. The ongoing military\r\noperation in Afghanistan cannot, while inflicting\r\ndestruction and casualties, address the root causes of\r\nthe kind of terrorism that has been forced on the\r\ndefenceless people of that country. On the contrary: it\r\nis more likely that the continuation of the current\r\nmilitary approach could incite sentiments that intensify\r\nintolerance and violence in the region and the whole\r\nworld.\r\nIn the midst of the global terrorism crisis, the\r\nworld faces an intensive and severe kind of terrorism in\r\nthe Middle East. The occupation of the Palestinian\r\nterritories, the expulsion of the Palestinian people from\r\ntheir homeland, the Judaization of Palestine — in\r\nparticular Al-Quds Al-Sharif — the building of illegal\r\nsettlements, the killing and terrorizing of defenceless\r\nPalestinian civilians in their homeland, and the\r\ndestruction of historical sites, civil institutions and\r\nresidential areas are all examples of this phenomenon.\r\nI would also like to underscore, on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77, the significance of poverty alleviation\r\nworldwide and the need for the support of the United\r\nNations. Poverty breeds violence and intolerance. The\r\nrecent slowdown in world economic growth and\r\ndevelopment caused by the terrorist attacks further\r\naggravates the economic hardships of the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nFor a secure and hopeful life, the world therefore\r\nneeds innovative approaches and collective measures.\r\nLet us therefore build a coalition for peace instead of\r\nwar and hostility. The initiative of dialogue among\r\ncivilizations is a step in this direction, and it offers a\r\nnew paradigm of interaction among nations and\r\ncultures in a world that longs for peace and security.\r\nCan the United Nations take the lead in devising\r\na programme to implement this fair and reasonable\r\napproach and become the focus of a global coalition for\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\npeace based on justice? I have every confidence in the\r\nwisdom and the will of the Secretary-General —\r\nillustrated, inter alia, by the publication of a book,\r\nentitled Crossing the Divide — to define a new\r\nparadigm of dialogue among civilizations. World\r\npublic opinion is supportive of this proposal. The\r\nadoption of the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations yesterday represents a beginning for the\r\ncrystallization of this common desire and will of the\r\nglobal community.\r\nThe achievements of the thirty-first United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) General Conference in\r\nestablishing dialogue among civilizations as one of its\r\nstrategic objectives and in adopting the Universal\r\nDeclaration on Cultural Diversity represent yet another\r\nserious indication of this global trend, and I wish to\r\npay tribute to UNESCO and its Director-General. Will\r\npoliticians and statesmen also submit to this approach,\r\nto prevent the transformation of the clash among States\r\ninto a clash among civilizations? I am hopeful; the\r\nfuture will be the judge.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Seyed Mohammad Khatami, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the first\r\nspeaker in the general debate, I should like to remind\r\nmembers of the decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at its third plenary meeting, on 19 September\r\n2001, that congratulations should not be expressed\r\ninside the General Assembly Hall after a speech has\r\nbeen delivered. In this connection, may I remind\r\nmembers of another decision taken by the General\r\nAssembly at the same meeting: that speakers in the\r\ngeneral debate, after delivering their statement, would\r\nleave the Assembly Hall through room GA-200,\r\nlocated behind the podium, before returning to their\r\nseats. I would also like to appeal to Member States to\r\nlimit their statements to 15 minutes.\r\nAddress by Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of India\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of India.\r\nMr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of India, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of India, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Vajpayee (India) (spoke in Hindi;\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation):\r\nI congratulate the President on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. I also take this opportunity to warmly\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nand the United Nations on being honoured with the\r\nNobel Peace Prize.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is being\r\nheld in the shadow of the barbaric terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember, which dramatically reminded us that\r\nneither distance nor power insulates a State from\r\nterrorism. Such acts represent an arrogant rejection of\r\nthe values of freedom and tolerance, which democratic\r\nand pluralistic societies cherish.\r\nEven while uniting the nations of the world in\r\ntheir grief, this terrible tragedy has created the\r\nopportunity to fashion a determined global response to\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever\r\nit exists and under whatever name.\r\nWe in India know from our own bitter experience\r\nthat terrorists develop global networks driven by\r\nreligious extremism. Their operations are supported by\r\ndrug trafficking, money laundering and arms\r\nsmuggling. Some States follow a policy of sponsoring\r\nand sheltering them. Terrorists can only be countered\r\nthrough closely coordinated efforts of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and\r\n1373 (2001) are steps in the right direction, but it\r\nrequires the firm political will of the freedom-loving\r\nworld to implement them rigorously. The two crucial\r\nelements in this would be strict curbs on sources of\r\nfinancing for terrorists and denying them safe havens\r\nfor training, arming and operation.\r\nWe must firmly rebuff any ideological, political\r\nor religious justification for terrorism. We should reject\r\nself-serving arguments seeking to classify terrorism\r\naccording to its root causes, and therefore justifying\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nterrorist action somewhere while condemning it\r\nelsewhere. Those that advance these arguments should\r\nexplain what the root causes of the brutal acts of 11\r\nSeptember were.\r\nIndia supports the current campaign against the\r\nterrorist networks in Afghanistan. We hope that it\r\nreaches an early and successful conclusion. That\r\ncountry’s current travails can only end with the\r\nestablishment of a broad-based, representative and\r\nneutral Government, which would stop the export of\r\nterrorism and extremism. The international community\r\nshould work towards this goal, even while the military\r\ncampaign continues, so that we avoid a political\r\nvacuum at the end of the campaign.\r\nWe must recognize that current structures to\r\nfacilitate a post-Taliban political settlement are\r\nunrepresentative and therefore ineffective. Located as\r\nit is in Afghanistan’s neighbourhood, India’s vital\r\nnational interests are affected by developments in it.\r\nWe also have traditionally close links with\r\nAfghanistan. This is the basis for our belief that India\r\ncan play a useful role in this process.\r\nThe task of reconstruction in post-conflict\r\nAfghanistan also merits the urgent attention of the\r\ninternational community. It would require massive\r\nexternal assistance to create an economic situation\r\nconducive to the speedy return and rehabilitation of the\r\nmillions of Afghans who have taken refuge in other\r\ncountries of this region. Again India stands ready to\r\njoin international efforts for this.\r\nWe have already announced relief assistance of a\r\nmillion tons of wheat, medicines and medical\r\nassistance for needy Afghans within, and outside, the\r\ncountry. We have also pledged $100 million to post-\r\nconflict Afghanistan for reconstruction. We are\r\nprepared to do more.\r\nNearly 6,000 lives were lost on 11 September, but\r\nthe global economic downturn in its aftermath will take\r\na far larger human toll, mainly in the developing world.\r\nThe World Bank has estimated that tens of thousands\r\nmore children will die worldwide and some 10 million\r\nmore people are likely to go below the poverty line of\r\n$1 a day. It is pertinent to reflect on these chilling\r\nstatistics even as the Ministerial Conference gets under\r\nway in Doha to consider World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) issues. Before we embark on any new\r\ninitiatives for globalization and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, we should recognize that political\r\nsupport for them will be determined primarily by the\r\nimpact of these regimes on poverty.\r\nFor most developing countries, the Uruguay\r\nRound has done little for economic growth, while\r\npoverty levels and income gaps have worsened.\r\nGlobalization has constrained developing countries in\r\nmobilizing public resources for poverty alleviation.\r\nThat is why public support for the globalization regime\r\nhas vanished in developing countries. This is also why\r\nwe have argued strongly that implementation issues\r\nshould first be resolved before we try to widen the\r\nWTO agenda further. Our public is unwilling to accept\r\nanother post-dated cheque, when an earlier one has\r\nbounced.\r\nSimilarly, the movement towards sustainable\r\ndevelopment has proved a disappointment. Developing\r\ncountries are unable to realize fair payments for their\r\nsovereign biodiversity resources and traditional\r\nknowledge. The treaties on climate change and\r\nbiodiversity have also failed to activate the anticipated\r\ninvestment and technology transfers to developing\r\ncountries. Industrialized countries have not shown the\r\npolitical will to enhance their overseas development\r\nbudgets. Multilateral development agencies are also\r\nconstrained in their resources, of which, in any case,\r\nvery little is available on concessional terms.\r\nThe inevitable conclusion is that for current\r\nregimes of globalization and sustainable development\r\nto be strengthened, or even to survive, they must be re-\r\nengineered to generate large-scale finances for poverty\r\nalleviation. The passion for globalization has to be\r\ntempered by compassion for its victims. Sadly, this\r\nthought has not penetrated into the thinking of the\r\ndeveloped economies. Their actions also do not reflect\r\nthe realization that there cannot be a sustainable revival\r\nof their own sluggish economies unless the\r\nglobalization and sustainable development priorities\r\nare re-oriented and anchored in the developmental\r\nneeds of two-thirds of the global population.\r\nA year ago, I suggested in my speech to the\r\nUnited States Congress a comprehensive global\r\ndialogue on development. The aim of such a dialogue\r\nwould be to address the highly unstable situation in\r\nwhich one-third of the world’s population lives in\r\nluxury and condemns the remaining two-thirds to\r\npoverty and want. It is a fertile breeding ground for\r\npolitical unrest, economic chaos and social fractures.\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nIndia would be happy to coordinate this dialogue,\r\nwith the immediate objective of mobilizing resources\r\nfor poverty alleviation programmes in developing\r\ncountries. A preliminary agenda for the dialogue could\r\ninclude the accelerated liquidation of external debts of\r\nlow-income and highly indebted countries; poverty\r\nalleviation programmes specifically aimed at\r\ndeveloping countries facing financial crises;\r\nstabilization of international prices of primary\r\ncommodity exports; and, most importantly, welfare and\r\ndevelopment programmes for all the world’s needy\r\nchildren — for their nutrition, health, education and\r\nprotection from degrading and hazardous employment.\r\nThe struggle for equitable development and the\r\nwar against poverty are as important as our campaign\r\nagainst terrorism and our collective search for security.\r\nAt a time when an external stimulus has motivated us\r\nto unite against terrorism and for security, let us\r\nsummon an equally strong inner resolve for\r\ndevelopment and poverty alleviation. They are just as\r\ncrucial for a global order at peace with itself.\r\nThis fundamental and seamless linkage between\r\npeace, security and development can be recalled in the\r\nsage words of the great Indian poet Rabindranath\r\nTagore:\r\n“From now onward, any nation that takes an\r\nisolated view of its own interests will run\r\ncontrary to the spirit of the New Age, and will\r\nknow no peace. From now onward, the anxiety\r\nthat each country has for its own safety must\r\nembrace the welfare of the whole world.”\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of India\r\nfor his statement.\r\nMr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of\r\nIndia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Lee Han-dong, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Korea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Lee Han-dong, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Lee Han-dong, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Lee Han-dong (Republic of Korea) (spoke in\r\nKorean; English text provided by the delegation):\r\nBefore all else, on behalf of the Government and\r\npeople of the Republic of Korea, I wish to convey our\r\ndeepest condolences and sympathy to the bereaved\r\nfamilies and friends of those who lost lives in the\r\nhorrendous terrorist attacks of 11 September. This\r\nunprecedented criminal act has posed a grave threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, as well as a serious\r\nchallenge to human dignity. Such terrorist acts\r\nconstitute a crime against humanity and civilization\r\nthat cannot be justified by any cause.\r\nTo forestall the recurrence of such incidents and\r\nto eradicate international terrorism, comprehensive and\r\ncommon efforts at the international level are urgently\r\nneeded. The United Nations is expected to play an\r\nimportant role in these efforts. Immediately after the\r\nterrorist attacks in September, the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolutions denouncing\r\nterrorism and calling for measures for its elimination.\r\nThis prompt action, as well as the ensuing debates at\r\nthe United Nations, attest to the major role to be played\r\nby the Organization in the anti-terrorism effort.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea will\r\ncontinue to actively take part in the measures taken by\r\nthe United Nations, including the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), and will join\r\nthe effort to free the international community from the\r\nscourge of terrorism. At the same time, we will spare\r\nno effort in rendering humanitarian assistance to the\r\nrefugees who have been displaced as a result of the war\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nFurthermore, in preparing to co-host the 2002\r\nKorea/Japan FIFA World Cup, we will do our utmost to\r\nensure that the event is held in a secure atmosphere\r\nfree from the threat of terrorism.\r\nI stand here with much reminiscence. The\r\nRepublic of Korea, once one of the major recipients of\r\nUnited Nations assistance, is now an active contributor\r\nto the effort to realize the ideals and goals of this body.\r\nIt is also the country whose Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs had the honour of presiding over the first\r\nsession of the General Assembly in the new century.\r\nThe birth of the Republic and its development\r\nthereafter owe a great deal to United Nations\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nassistance. Indeed, the Government of the Republic of\r\nKorea was born from the United Nations-supervised\r\nelections held pursuant to the United Nations\r\nresolution calling for an independent Government in\r\nKorea. During the Korean war, in the early 1950s, we\r\nwere able to defend our country, thanks to the\r\nparticipation and noble sacrifice of the United Nations\r\nforces.\r\nAfter the war, as the Korean people strove to\r\novercome the war’s devastation, rebuild the country,\r\nachieve economic development and emerge a\r\ndemocracy, upholding human rights, we found\r\nenormous strength and encouragement in the support\r\nand cooperation rendered by the United Nations. The\r\nKorean people will never forget this. We will redouble\r\nour efforts to do our share for the cause of global peace\r\nand prosperity, as enshrined in the Charter.\r\nLooking back on the Republic of Korea’s arduous\r\nand eventful process of development over the past half\r\ncentury, we see that it is an exemplary case of all the\r\ngood that can be achieved when the international\r\ncommunity works closely with a people determined to\r\novercome poverty and the legacy of conflict in order to\r\nbuild a better future for themselves.\r\nTen years have passed since the simultaneous\r\nadmission of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to the United Nations. In\r\nthe intervening decade, particularly during recent\r\nyears, much progress has been made in inter-Korean\r\nrelations. Taking this opportunity, I would like to\r\nbriefly touch upon the peace process that is unfolding\r\non the Korean peninsula — an effort for which we seek\r\nmembers’ continuing support.\r\nThe first inter-Korean summit, held in June 2000,\r\nwas truly a historic event for peace, not only on the\r\nKorean peninsula, but also in East Asia and indeed the\r\nworld. Before the summit, the Korean peninsula had\r\nremained a lone island where the cold war maintained\r\nits foothold. The summit initiated the process of\r\nmelting away that foothold — the icy wall of hostility\r\nand confrontation that had thickened between South\r\nand North Korea over the past half century. The whole\r\nworld welcomed the breakthrough, expressing high\r\nhopes for peace on the Korean peninsula, as\r\nexemplified here by the joint statement of the co-\r\nchairpersons of the Millennium Summit and the\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution.\r\nSince then positive changes have taken place on\r\nthe Korean peninsula. There have been three rounds of\r\nreunions by members of separated families. At the\r\nopening of the Sydney Olympic Games, the world was\r\nmoved to see South and North Korean athletes march\r\nin together. The project to relink a railway and road\r\nbetween the two Koreas is now under way. The first\r\nSouth-North Defence Ministers’ meeting was held with\r\na view to reducing tension and furthering peace.\r\nMeanwhile, North Korea has steadily expanded\r\nits diplomatic horizon, establishing diplomatic ties with\r\nmost countries of the European Union and many\r\nothers. Such endeavours have been strongly welcomed\r\nand supported by the Republic of Korea, which has\r\nstriven to shore up global support for the Korean peace\r\nprocess.\r\nThe goal of our sunshine policy of promoting\r\nengagement between South and North Korea is for the\r\ntwo sides to live together in peace and cooperation, in\r\npreparation for peaceful unification. The engagement\r\npolicy is actively supported by the whole world, not to\r\nmention the Korean people and key neighbours\r\nsurrounding the Korean peninsula. North Korea, too,\r\nembraced the spirit of peace, reconciliation and\r\ncooperation Joint Declaration of 15 June 2000 issued at\r\nthe inter-Korean summit.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Korea will\r\ncontinue to do its utmost so that a lasting peace may\r\ntake root on the Korean peninsula and global peace\r\nmay be strengthened. We sincerely thank the United\r\nNations and the leaders of the world for the\r\nencouragement they have given us so far. We shall\r\ncontinue to count on their steadfast support and\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe work required of the United Nations in the\r\ntwenty-first century is no less than daunting. Numerous\r\ntasks lie ahead of us, such as fostering international\r\npeace and security, promoting the common prosperity\r\nof the global village, advancing democracy and human\r\nrights, eradicating poverty, combating transnational\r\ncrime, protecting the environment and enhancing\r\nhuman well-being.\r\nRising to these challenges, world leaders gathered\r\nlast year at the Millennium Summit to reconfirm their\r\nresponsibilities and to chart a new course for the\r\ninternational community in the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration aims at materializing a\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nnew United Nations that can effectively meet the many\r\nchallenges faced by the international community.\r\nIt should be appreciated in particular that the\r\nDeclaration sets concrete policy goals to free humanity\r\nfrom fear and poverty. Now the task before all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations is to muster the best of\r\ntheir wisdom and strength in devising and\r\nimplementing measures to fulfil the commitments\r\noutlined in the Millennium Declaration. The Republic\r\nof Korea will actively cooperate with all other\r\nMembers, so that these commitments may be carried\r\nout faithfully.\r\nWith the end of the cold war and the passing of\r\nthe twentieth century, reconciliation and cooperation\r\nhave come to define the tenor of the evolving global\r\norder. However, genuine global peace has yet to be\r\nobtained. In many corners of the globe, the threat of\r\nterrorism looms large, and conflicts and confrontations\r\ncaused by ethnic, religious and economic factors still\r\npersist. Far worse, the greatest victims are often the\r\nmost vulnerable groups, such as children, women and\r\nethnic minorities. In this regard, I fully support the\r\nefforts of the United Nations to strengthen its\r\ncapability to prevent and resolve conflicts and to deal\r\nwith their aftermath. The conflict prevention and\r\npeacekeeping function of the United Nations is\r\nessential for global peace, and the role of the United\r\nNations in post-conflict peace-building should also be\r\nexpanded.\r\nHumanity in the twenty-first century is at the\r\nmercy of rapid and sweeping changes that are\r\nunprecedented in the history of human civilization. At\r\nthe core of the vortex lie the information technology\r\nrevolution and globalization. If we fail to meet the\r\nchallenges posed by these trends, the promises of peace\r\nand prosperity in the twenty-first century will not be\r\nfulfilled. Member States of the United Nations must\r\ngather their collective wisdom and will so that all\r\nmembers of the international community can enjoy the\r\nbenefits of globalization and the revolutionary\r\nadvances in information and communication\r\ntechnology.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, President Kim Dae-jung\r\nproposed building a trans-Eurasia information network\r\nat the Asia-Europe Summit last year, with a view to\r\ngalvanizing information exchange and cooperation\r\nbetween Asia and Europe to an unprecedented level. In\r\norder to narrow the information gap between nations,\r\ninternational assistance is required, particularly in\r\nbuilding the information infrastructures and human\r\nresources of developing countries. In this regard,\r\ngreater cooperation and attention on the part of the\r\ndeveloped countries are essential.\r\nFurthermore, the effective management of the\r\nglobal economy and poverty eradication in the\r\nunderdeveloped countries should be placed high on the\r\nagenda of global consultations. The visibility and\r\ntransparency of global financial markets should be\r\nenhanced by reinforcing the functions of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the International\r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and\r\nother international financial organizations.\r\nThe next round of World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) talks should be launched as soon as possible in\r\norder to strengthen free trade and the multilateral\r\ntrading system. In this regard, I hope the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nin March of next year, will succeed in devising a\r\ncomprehensive plan to deal with issues related to\r\npoverty and development. We have to bear in mind the\r\nlesson drawn from history that fostering the middle-\r\nclass through poverty eradication can lay a solid\r\nfoundation for democracy.\r\nAs far as the environment is concerned,\r\ninternational efforts to protect “Mother Nature” should\r\nbe carried out in a more effective and substantial\r\nmanner.\r\nIn some advanced countries, the development of\r\nbio-technology has reached such astonishing levels as\r\nto arouse fear of infringing upon the realm of God.\r\nWhile acknowledging the positive role such scientific\r\nadvancements may have in prolonging human life and\r\nimproving the quality of life, we need to prevent them\r\nfrom being misused and from becoming an affront to\r\nhuman dignity.\r\nDemocracy and human rights are universal values\r\nthat must continue to be sought and upheld in the\r\ntwenty-first century. In recent decades, democracy and\r\nhuman rights have claimed many victories around the\r\nworld, but they have also suffered setbacks. Human\r\nrights continue to be abused in many parts of the world\r\nin the form of kidnapping and torture, illegal\r\nexecutions, discrimination and other violations. It is\r\nparticularly distressing that large-scale and systematic\r\nviolations of human rights persist in some regions of\r\nconflict. Such deplorable acts cannot be tolerated. I\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nsincerely hope that the second conference of the\r\nCommunity of Democracies, to be held in Seoul in\r\nOctober of next year, will prove to be a milestone in\r\nthis regard.\r\nHumanity places great expectations upon the\r\nUnited Nations to meet the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century and to make the most of the opportunities\r\nit brings, because this global body provides a unique\r\nforum for all the countries of the world together to seek\r\nsolutions to common problems in the spirit of mutual\r\nrespect and cooperation. To rise to the task, the United\r\nNations requires ongoing reform. Its financial and\r\norganizational foundations must be strengthened in\r\naccordance with its expanding roles. In particular, the\r\nreform of the Security Council, given its importance to\r\nall Member States, must be achieved through general\r\nagreement, with a view to making the Council more\r\nrepresentative, democratic and efficient.\r\nThe United Nations must stand firmly at the\r\ncentre of efforts to further spread and consolidate\r\nmultilateralism around the world, based on the spirit of\r\nmutual understanding and compromise. Tolerance and\r\ndialogue must be upheld in international relations if we\r\nare to make the twenty-first century an era of shared\r\nprosperity and peaceful coexistence among diverse\r\ncivilizations.\r\nThe Republic of Korea will strive to contribute to\r\nthe further development of the United Nations in the\r\nspirit of repaying the generosity it has received from\r\nthe international community. Befitting the country’s\r\ngrowing capabilities, the Republic of Korea’s\r\ncontribution to the United Nations budget is to increase\r\nsignificantly in the coming years, in accordance with\r\nthe new scale of assessments adopted last year. Next\r\nyear, it will become the tenth largest contributor to the\r\nregular budget of the United Nations. With its troops\r\nnow taking part in the Organization’s peacekeeping\r\nmissions in East Timor and three other places, the\r\nRepublic of Korea will also continue to actively\r\nparticipate in the United Nations endeavours for peace\r\nand security.\r\nFurthermore, we will share our experiences in\r\neconomic development and democratization with our\r\nneighbours in the global village and do what we can to\r\nbridge the gap between the developing and developed\r\ncountries.\r\nI am convinced that the United Nations, on the\r\nstrength of the concerted efforts of all countries\r\nrepresented here, will continue to be a beacon of hope,\r\nlighting the road ahead for humanity in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, my own country, for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Lee Han-dong, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nMr. Aguirre Martínez (Paraguay), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call\r\non His Excellency Mr. Louis Michel, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour today to speak on behalf of the European\r\nUnion, which wishes, through you, Sir, to congratulate\r\nthe President on his election. That election testifies to\r\nthe esteem of the international community for his\r\nperson and his country. I commend the speed of action\r\nand efficiency that you have shown in the face of the\r\ntragic events of 11 September, in adapting the agenda\r\nfor the work of this Assembly.\r\nI would also like to associate with this tribute the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan.\r\nMr. Secretary-General, your re-election had already\r\ndrawn attention to the unanimous appreciation of the\r\nMember States for your exceptional qualities as a\r\nmanager, politician and humanist. The Nobel\r\nCommittee paid an even wider tribute by awarding you\r\nthe Nobel Peace Prize. The United Nations itself, here\r\nat your side, was also a recipient of this message of\r\nhope from a world in a state of shock, appealing to the\r\nUnited Nations to remain at the centre of the\r\ninternational community’s action for peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt was the fundamental values constituting the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations that were attacked in\r\nso cowardly a manner right here in New York on 11\r\nSeptember, when our host country, several thousands of\r\nits citizens and nationals of over 60 countries were the\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nvictims of a barbaric act of aggression for which no\r\njustification can be accepted.\r\nThat attack, by its enormity, has opened our eyes\r\nto the worldwide threat that terrorism has become. It is\r\nour open, democratic, tolerant and multicultural\r\nsocieties that were attacked through the United States.\r\nThe terrorist threat must be hunted down in each of our\r\ncountries, in our various regional organizations and, at\r\nthe world level, through the United Nations.\r\nThe European Union has most categorically\r\ncondemned the 11 September attacks, and the fight\r\nagainst terrorism is now, more than ever before, one of\r\nour top objectives. The Union has declared its total\r\nsolidarity with the United States. It has reaffirmed its\r\nunreserved support for the military action undertaken\r\nin the name of legitimate self-defence, in conformity\r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations and Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1368 (2001).\r\nOn 21 September, an Extraordinary European\r\nCouncil adopted an action plan for an unprecedented\r\ncampaign against terrorism. This plan contains a\r\nnumber of specific measures intended to enhance\r\njudicial and police cooperation, including the\r\nintroduction of a European arrest warrant. It also\r\nincludes measures to put an end to the financing of\r\nterrorism and to improve air security. The European\r\nCouncil acknowledged that the fight against terrorism\r\nrequires greater participation by the Union in the\r\nefforts of the international community to prevent and\r\nstabilize regional conflicts. By developing the\r\nCommon Foreign and Security Policy and bringing the\r\nEuropean Security and Defence Policy into operation\r\nas soon as possible, the Union will be at its most\r\neffective.\r\nAt the global level also, fresh impetus must be\r\nprovided to the fight against terrorism. Naturally, the\r\nUnited Nations has a central role to play in developing\r\na coordinated and diversified strategy. We warmly\r\nwelcome the major steps that have already been taken\r\nto that end. The most remarkable of these was the\r\nadoption of resolution 1373 (2001) by the Security\r\nCouncil on 28 September. The European Union and its\r\nmember States are already committed to rapid\r\nenactment of the measures needed for its\r\nimplementation. We call upon all countries to\r\ncooperate actively with the follow-up system set up by\r\nthe Security Council, and we reiterate our readiness to\r\nprovide aid in that connection to any countries that\r\nmay have technical difficulties in meeting the\r\nrequirements.\r\nIt is also essential that all States ratify without\r\ndelay the 12 conventions on combating terrorism and\r\napply all of their provisions. The International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism is a decisive aspect of international action\r\nand needs to be speedily signed and ratified.\r\nLastly, the European Union welcomes the recent\r\nprogress made in negotiating a comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism, on the basis of a\r\ndraft submitted by India. The remaining difficulties\r\nmust now be dealt with as soon as possible so that this\r\ninstrument can be ready for signing early next year.\r\nThe efforts we are making to combat terrorism\r\nmust also form part of overall efforts to build a better\r\nworld, a world in which human dignity is sacrosanct, in\r\nwhich human rights and fundamental freedoms are\r\nfully respected.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights\r\nand an attachment to the principles of democracy and\r\nthe rule of law are essential components of the\r\nEuropean Union’s Common Foreign and Security\r\nPolicy and of its development, cooperation and\r\nexternal relations. The European Union will actively\r\npursue its work on consolidating human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, with particular insistence on the\r\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent nature of all\r\nhuman rights. It will continue to support efforts by the\r\nSecretary-General to integrate human rights into\r\nUnited Nations activities at all levels and in all forums,\r\nand to cooperate with all United Nations human rights\r\nmachinery.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the imminent\r\nestablishment of the much-awaited International\r\nCriminal Court. The Union sees this as being of\r\nparamount importance and urges all States that have\r\nnot yet done so to accede to the Rome Statute as soon\r\nas possible. More than ever before, we need a universal\r\nand permanent court capable of sanctioning the most\r\nserious violations of international humanitarian law\r\nand human rights, thereby contributing to peace and\r\nsecurity in the world. It is vital that the United Nations\r\ngive effective support to the establishment of the\r\nCourt.\r\nFollowing the tragedy of 11 September, the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on the 10-year\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nreview of the World Summit for Children had to be\r\npostponed. However, until it is held, we need to keep\r\nup the momentum developed in the preparatory\r\ndiscussions. We must continue to integrate the specific\r\ndimension of the child into our actions and strive to\r\nensure that every child’s life is free from terror, the\r\nhorrors of war, abuse and exploitation, hunger and\r\npoverty.\r\nThe European Union is resolved to continue the\r\nfight against all forms of discrimination and violence\r\nagainst women, and to ensure that all countries take\r\nstrong measures to apply the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen. Women must be able to enjoy their human\r\nrights in full, on an equal footing with men. Girls must\r\nhave the same opportunities as boys, particularly in\r\neducation and access to social services. The European\r\nUnion insists also that there be equal rights to property,\r\ncredit facilities and social services, including\r\nreproductive health services. It is in the interest of\r\neveryone that women be able to participate fully in\r\neconomic and political life at all levels.\r\nThe Union stresses the importance of\r\nimplementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)\r\nand the special attention that must be given to the\r\nparticipation and full association of women on an equal\r\nfooting in all efforts aimed at maintaining and\r\npromoting peace and security.\r\nWe must also vigorously pursue the crucial fight\r\nagainst racist and discriminatory tendencies and\r\nintolerance, which are daily realities throughout the\r\nworld. The World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\r\nhas, I believe, shown us the way forward. It has also\r\nenabled us to advance our ways of thinking about the\r\ncauses and origins of racism and, above all, to view our\r\npast in a new way. What matters now is that we find\r\nthe will to close the darkest chapters of our history so\r\nthat we can build a new relationship based on mutual\r\nrespect, solidarity and partnership.\r\nThe terrible humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan is\r\ngripping the attention of the international community\r\njust as much as the political, diplomatic, military and\r\neconomic aspects of the situation in that country. This\r\nis the first time that the international community has\r\nadopted such a global approach to an armed conflict.\r\nWe are convinced that this is the best — if not the\r\nonly — way to ensure effective resolution of the crisis.\r\nThe coordination of aid efforts, primarily on the ground\r\nand as part of the range of actions undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations, remains essential.\r\nEmergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan is an\r\nabsolute priority for the European Union, which has\r\nundertaken to mobilize an aid package of over 320\r\nmillion euros as soon as possible. The Union expresses\r\nits concern about the difficulties of access, as well as of\r\ndelivering humanitarian assistance, in Afghanistan. It\r\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations specialized\r\nagencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\nand all humanitarian organizations in seeking practical\r\nand flexible solutions. It also calls on the countries of\r\nthe region to facilitate, by all possible means,\r\nhumanitarian operations to deal with new influxes of\r\nAfghan refugees.\r\nThe European Union recognizes the vital role of\r\nthe United Nations in the search for a peace plan for\r\nAfghanistan. It intends to support the initiatives of the\r\nSecretary-General and his Special Representative and\r\nto make a constructive contribution, with regard to\r\nboth the search for an internal political solution and to\r\na plan for rebuilding the country. The Union also\r\nstresses the importance of the regional dimension of\r\nthe stabilization of Afghanistan.\r\nWe must make adequate contributions to the\r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs so\r\nas to ensure that it can function efficiently. The\r\nEuropean Union attaches particular importance to aid\r\nto persons displaced within their countries. We\r\ntherefore welcome the fact that a unit has been\r\nestablished within the Secretariat to cater to their\r\nspecific needs. Following the recent attacks against\r\nhumanitarian aid personnel, the European Union can\r\nonly call once again for the strengthening of\r\narrangements, particularly those of a legal and financial\r\nnature, for guaranteeing the safety and security of\r\nhumanitarian aid workers and United Nations workers\r\nin general.\r\nNow more than ever, disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation constitute the cornerstone of any peace\r\nand security structure, and must therefore be subject to\r\nbinding multilateral norms. It is against that\r\nbackground that we wish to strengthen the non-\r\nproliferation regime, promote the rapid entry into force\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and\r\nreinforce the biological and toxin weapons Convention.\r\nWe must also combat the proliferation of ballistic\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nmissiles and the illicit trade in light weapons and\r\ncontinue to work for the complete elimination of anti-\r\npersonnel mines.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping, the United Nations\r\nhas shown in the past year that it is better equipped and\r\nbetter organized than it has been in recent times. By\r\nway of example, I should like to mention the\r\noperations in East Timor, Eritrea and Sierra Leone.\r\nProgress has thus already been made on the ground in\r\nimplementing the recommendations of the Brahimi\r\nreport. But much remains to be done, and the European\r\nUnion will continue to provide its active support for\r\nimproving the capabilities of the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations and advocating that the\r\nOrganization be given the resources that it needs to\r\nenable it effectively to discharge its increasingly\r\ncomplex responsibilities.\r\nA comprehensive and long-term approach is\r\nrequired in order to resolve differences of opinion,\r\nconsolidate peace and prevent a resurgence of conflict.\r\nThe European Union, which is currently establishing\r\nits own military and civil crisis-management capability,\r\nis actively engaged in strengthening its cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations in the area of conflict prevention, crisis\r\nmanagement, humanitarian aid, post-conflict\r\nreconstruction and long-term development.\r\nThe Balkans, a region so close to the countries of\r\nthe European Union, remains at the centre of the\r\nUnion’s external activities. We resolutely maintain our\r\ncommitment to contribute to building a region of\r\nsecurity, prosperity and democracy there, where multi-\r\nethnic societies can be free to flourish. Progress has\r\nbeen remarkable and encouraging, but unfortunately in\r\nmany cases the situation remains fragile. The\r\ninternational community must remain vigilant and must\r\nnot let extremists, of whatever kind, use violence to\r\ndestroy the stabilization work already carried out.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is worsening.\r\nThe lack of any political perspective naturally\r\nencourages continued confrontation and plays into the\r\nhands of extremists. Defiance, fear and resentment\r\nradicalize people’s mindsets. The European Union calls\r\non Israelis and Palestinians, while there is still time,\r\nimmediately to resume the peace process, without\r\npreconditions, on the basis of the Mitchell report. It\r\ncalls on the Israeli authorities to immediately withdraw\r\ntheir forces from Palestinian-administered areas. It\r\ncalls on the Palestinian Authority to do its utmost to\r\narrest those responsible for violence against Israel.\r\nIt is necessary to preserve what has been achieved\r\nso far in the peace process: the principles of the Madrid\r\nConference, in particular the principle of land for\r\npeace, as well as Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973) and the agreements signed by\r\nthe parties, which have already led to real results on the\r\nground and to progress on the basis of earlier\r\nnegotiations. The European Union calls on both parties\r\nto do their utmost in the political, security, economic\r\nand social areas in order to get back to the negotiating\r\ntable, without preconditions, with the objective of\r\nrealizing the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the\r\nregion, as set out at the Madrid Conference of 1991.\r\nFor the Palestinians, the establishment of a viable\r\ndemocratic State and an end to the occupation of their\r\nterritory is essential. The Israelis must have the right to\r\nlive in peace and security within internationally\r\nrecognized borders. The European Union also recalls\r\nthat the search for a comprehensive and lasting peace\r\nin the region requires due account to be taken of the\r\nIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese aspects of the\r\nconflict. The same principles should apply in the\r\nresolution of those situations.\r\nIt is primarily for the parties themselves to try to\r\nfind peace through negotiating all elements relating to\r\npermanent status. This will include finding a viable and\r\njust solution to the particularly complex issues of\r\nJerusalem and the refugees, as well as those of the\r\neconomic support for the Palestinian people.\r\nThe European Union, in close cooperation with\r\nthe United States of America and the other partners\r\ninvolved, reaffirms its willingness to work for a final\r\nsettlement to the conflict. We believe that it is now a\r\nmatter of urgency to develop an initiative to strongly\r\nurge the parties to resume their political dialogue.\r\nThe European Union finds the status quo in\r\nCyprus unacceptable. We express our disappointment\r\nat the unjustified decision of the Turkish side to decline\r\nthe Secretary-General’s invitation to pursue talks. We\r\ncontinue to support the Secretary-General’s endeavours\r\ntowards a comprehensive and lasting settlement of the\r\nCyprus question in accordance with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nThe scale of the tragedies on the African\r\ncontinent demands resolute action on our part, at all\r\nlevels, to address the direct structural causes of those\r\n40\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nconflicts. Conflicts in Africa have become increasingly\r\ncomplex and their cross-border effects increasingly\r\ndestructive. The crises in the Great Lakes region of\r\nWest Africa, in Zimbabwe and in the Horn of Africa\r\nrequire increased vigilance on the part of the\r\nOrganization. Those crises also show the need for a\r\ncomprehensive and integrated international approach.\r\nWe gave an enthusiastic welcome to the launch of the\r\nNew African Initiative at the Lusaka summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. The European Union\r\nhas stated its willingness to respond and has already\r\nentered into a dialogue at the highest level with the\r\nAfrican Union.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, we pledged together\r\nto attain a set of development objectives. That is an\r\nambitious project which involves, inter alia, good\r\ngovernance in each country and at the international\r\nlevel. The Union underlines the need for strengthened\r\npartnership between rich countries and poor countries\r\nto achieve the development objectives of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. That partnership entails\r\nobligations and joint but varied efforts on the part of all\r\ncountries.\r\nFirst of all, we must make every effort to\r\neradicate poverty. New, concrete commitments were\r\nmade at the third United Nations Conference on Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, held at Brussels last May. The\r\nEuropean Union committed itself to untying aid, to\r\nopening up its markets through the “everything but\r\narms” initiative and to the full financing of the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. It is\r\nnow a question of finalizing the follow-up mechanisms\r\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries. The European Union will also continue to\r\ngive priority to the development of Africa.\r\nTwo major international conferences will give us\r\nan opportunity to take up the challenges and achieve\r\nthe principal objectives of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nAt the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held next March at Monterrey,\r\nMexico, we shall focus on improving cooperation\r\namong all development actors, and on using resources\r\nmore effectively and better mobilizing them.\r\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held at Johannesburg in October\r\n2002, we wish to promote the sustainable use and\r\nmanagement and the protection of the natural resources\r\nthat are the underpinning of economic and social\r\ndevelopment. We wish also to integrate action on the\r\nenvironment and poverty, to ensure that globalization\r\nserves the needs of sustainable development, and to\r\npromote better ways of managing public affairs and\r\nparticipation. The European Union would like to\r\nexplore with its partners the possibility of achieving at\r\nthe Summit a global pact on sustainable development.\r\nSuch a pact should contain commitments both from\r\nGovernments and from other actors. A global pact\r\nshould lead to concrete action to improve the\r\nimplementation of sustainable development policies.\r\nWe hope that United Nations Member States will\r\nwithout delay commit themselves to be represented at\r\nMonterrey and at Johannesburg at the highest possible\r\npolitical level.\r\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on\r\nClimate Change was one of the major results of the\r\n1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and\r\nDevelopment. We welcome the progress made at Bonn\r\nand at Marrakesh, and we undertake speedily to ratify\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol.\r\nWe have also just reached an intergovernmental\r\nconsensus at the highest level on the strategy needed to\r\nhalt the appalling global AIDS pandemic. That was a\r\nmajor step forward, but the urgent and tragic nature of\r\nthe problem demand greater ambition. We will actively\r\ncontribute to the creation of the new Global Fund to\r\ncombat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and we\r\nwill play an active role in all the other processes that\r\nemerged from last June’s special session so that the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS is put into\r\npractice through concrete measures.\r\nAmong other challenges, the demographic\r\nchanges that lie ahead are of particular interest to the\r\nEuropean Union. The second World Assembly on\r\nAgeing, to be held at Madrid in April 2002, will be an\r\nopportunity for us to work together to build a society\r\nfor all ages.\r\nThe Millennium Summit enabled us to tackle, at\r\nthe highest level, the major challenges facing the world\r\ncommunity. We must now turn our attention to the\r\nprocess of following up the Declaration adopted by\r\nheads of State or Government with all due regard for\r\nthe lofty and balanced aims of that cardinal text. For\r\nthat, we need reliable data and depend on the existing\r\nfollow-up machinery and processes and on the\r\nconcerted efforts of the various actors in the\r\n41\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\ninternational community who can help us to achieve\r\nthose objectives.\r\nWe must also continue reform of the United\r\nNations system as a whole, including the specialized\r\nagencies and the operational funds and programmes.\r\nThe strengthening of the Security Council and its\r\ncomprehensive reform in all its aspects should be\r\npursued with determination. If we want a Security\r\nCouncil capable of responding even more effectively to\r\nthe major challenges of the moment, we must intensify\r\nour efforts.\r\nLooking beyond the tremendous and growing\r\ncomplexity of our actions at the international level, our\r\ndebate should highlight this basic truth: if we want to\r\nbuild a world made more peaceful by respect for the\r\nlaw, solidarity and tolerance, we must strengthen our\r\ncohesiveness in the face of the new challenges before\r\nus, and also step up our efforts to promote human\r\nrights, eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this forum of the United Nations, we reply to\r\nthe messengers of destruction with our common ideal,\r\nwhich will be stronger than hatred and division among\r\nmankind. That edifice, whose foundations are set in our\r\nspirits and in our hearts, will be unassailable.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I call\r\nnext on His Excellency Mr. Anatoliy M. Zlenko,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Zlenko (Ukraine): Allow me at the outset to\r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-sixth session, Mr. Han Seung-soo, on his\r\nelection to that important and responsible post. On\r\nbehalf of the Ukrainian delegation, I would like to\r\nassure him of our full support and to wish him every\r\nsuccess in his work. I take this opportunity also to\r\nexpress our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, whose political wisdom and diplomatic skill\r\nenabled the Assembly to achieve important results at\r\nits fifty-fifth session.\r\nA year ago, at the Millennium Summit, we, the\r\nrepresentatives of the nations of the world, were seen\r\nas heralds of a new age. At that memorable gathering,\r\nthe United Nations heard words that gave humanity\r\nhope for a new and just model of international relations\r\nin the new century: freedom, equality, solidarity,\r\ntolerance and mutual responsibility. Those fundamental\r\nvalues enshrined in the Millennium Declaration\r\noutlined the path that the peoples of the world will\r\nfollow in the new era.\r\nHowever, while striving to breathe the fresh air of\r\nthe future, we instead swallowed a mouthful of ashes\r\nand dust. On 11 September the modern world was\r\nbrutally wounded. The death of innocent people\r\nshocked all those who cherish the universal values of\r\nlife and freedom.\r\nThe terrorist acts that took place in the United\r\nStates demonstrated that the philosophy of hatred,\r\nwhich has no religious, ethnic or linguistic affiliation,\r\nhas become one of the key challenges of the\r\ncontemporary world. This threat requires an urgent and\r\nclear international reaction.\r\nUkraine shares the pain of the American people\r\nand fully supports the resolve of the United States\r\neffectively to stand against the perpetrators, patrons\r\nand instigators of those terrorist acts.\r\nWe joined the global anti-terrorist coalition\r\nwithout any hesitation because we recognize the need\r\nto unite the efforts of the international community to\r\ncounter new threats.\r\nThe military campaign in Afghanistan, which\r\ntargets the core of international terrorism, is the first\r\nstage, and a necessary element, of these efforts. It is\r\nalso evident, however, that the Afghan people, who\r\nlive in a state of permanent humanitarian crisis, have\r\nbecome hostages to terrorism. As a result, this crisis\r\ncannot be brought to an end without consistent political\r\nand diplomatic efforts aimed at finding a solution.\r\nUkraine welcomes the activities of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Special Representative, Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi, and supports their constructive contribution to\r\nthe stabilization of the situation in Afghanistan.\r\nWe are convinced that efforts to further\r\nstrengthen and improve international legal mechanisms\r\nfor combating terrorism should also be given a\r\npowerful political impetus. In this context, the speedy\r\nconclusion of work on the draft comprehensive\r\nconvention on terrorism takes on special importance.\r\nI am also pleased to mention that the proposal of\r\nmy country to convene a ministerial meeting of the\r\nSecurity Council to discuss further steps in the global\r\nresponse to international terrorism was unanimously\r\nsupported by the members of the Council. There is no\r\ndoubt that, in the course of such a meeting, vital steps\r\n42\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nwill be taken to identify key means and methods of\r\ncombating terrorism.\r\nWe also maintain that there is a need for proper\r\ninstitutional arrangements to coordinate and\r\ncomplement the individual efforts of Member States in\r\ncombating international terrorism and to ensure that the\r\nlegal instruments we have elaborated are implemented\r\nin the most efficient manner possible. Any entity of\r\nthis sort should not become just another bureaucratic\r\nbody, but, rather, should be an effective mechanism for\r\ncontributing to the consolidation of international\r\nefforts in this area.\r\nTo honour the memory of the thousands who have\r\nperished in terrorist attacks and to further unite our\r\nefforts in fighting the scourge of terrorism, I would like\r\nto propose, on behalf of the Government of Ukraine, to\r\ndeclare 11 September a United Nations day to combat\r\ninternational terrorism. I hope that this proposal will be\r\nsupported by the General Assembly, which would then\r\nestablish this day as a symbol of our remembrance,\r\nunity and resolve.\r\nUkraine welcomes the decision taken this year by\r\nthe Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace\r\nPrize to the United Nations and to its Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan. He is exactly the kind of leader\r\nthe United Nations needs today as it faces new global\r\nchallenges.\r\nAre we ready to stand up to these new\r\nchallenges? Have we fully realized that the\r\ndeterioration of the situation in the world is due to the\r\nexisting, deep-rooted international inequality? And,\r\nfinally, how will the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly be remembered — as a session that put an\r\nend to the age of illusions, or as a forum that\r\nconsolidated the United Nations family?\r\nThe United Nations is entering a new period of its\r\nhistory. Ukraine is deeply convinced that, from a\r\nstrategic perspective, the strengthening of the status of\r\nthe United Nations as the core of the modern system of\r\ninternational relations should become the primary task\r\nof this Organization.\r\nThe terrorist acts in the United States have united\r\nand consolidated the international community. Why has\r\nit taken the tragic loss of thousands of innocent lives\r\nfor it to realize that there is a vital need for unity of\r\naction on its part?\r\nWe believe that the essence of United Nations\r\nleadership lies in ensuring an effective response to the\r\nnew challenges to security at both the global and\r\nregional levels. This role, however, cannot be played\r\neffectively if we do not improve the existing model of\r\ndecision-making and implementation at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nThat is why my country actively supports the\r\nreform of the Security Council. We see this reform not\r\nas a weakening of the foundations of the Council\u0027s\r\nwork, but, on the contrary, as a move that will\r\nstrengthen them, by ensuring that they better reflect the\r\nrealities of the modern world.\r\nThis year, Ukraine is completing its term as a\r\nmember of the Security Council. I believe that the\r\nexperience we have gained will contribute to advancing\r\nthe process of change. We will consistently advocate\r\nthe need to improve the Security Council\u0027s methods of\r\nwork and to enlarge its membership. As a Central\r\nEuropean nation, Ukraine will actively lobby for an\r\nadditional seat on the Council for this region.\r\nIn our view, special attention should also be paid\r\nto the philosophy of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nactivities and to the problem of sanctions. For many\r\nyears, Ukraine — which today is among the 10 largest\r\ntroop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions — has consistently supported the\r\ndevelopment of effective United Nations preventive\r\nmechanisms.\r\nAt the Millennium and Security Council summits\r\nlast year, the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma,\r\nemphasized the need for the elaboration of a United\r\nNations strategy for comprehensive conflict prevention\r\nbased on the wide use of preventive diplomacy.\r\nI am pleased to note that the recommendations on\r\nconflict prevention put forward by Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan in his June report echo the proposal made\r\nby the President of Ukraine. We believe that the United\r\nNations possesses the necessary experience and\r\nresources for the enhancement of its role in this field,\r\nin particular through the establishment of regional\r\ncentres to monitor potential areas of conflict, as well as\r\nthrough the more active use of preventive deployment\r\noperations.\r\nConcerning the issue of sanctions, we are in\r\nfavour of the elaboration of a well-balanced\r\nmethodology for their imposition, implementation and\r\n43\r\nA/56/PV.44\r\nlifting. This critical lever of influence should not be\r\nturned into a political boomerang.\r\nWe are also convinced of the overriding need to\r\nfurther consolidate international efforts towards arms\r\ncontrol, disarmament and the non-proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. On the basis of a realistic\r\nassessment of the potential of the Conference on\r\nFacilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), we hope that it will\r\nresult in an increase in the number of parties to this\r\nTreaty, which was ratified by Ukraine last year.\r\nI would also like to mention that next month\r\nUkraine will complete the implementation of the third,\r\nand last, phase of strategic weapons destruction under\r\nthe START Treaty. On 30 October, Ukraine destroyed\r\nits last intercontinental ballistic missile silo. In that\r\nway we turned one of the important pages in the\r\nhistory of nuclear disarmament. We are ready to\r\ncontinue to make our contribution to secure the\r\neffectiveness of the system of strategic stability in the\r\nworld.\r\nUkraine supports further development by the\r\nUnited Nations of a universal approach to the issues of\r\nensuring sustainable development and eradicating\r\npoverty in the world. We hope that the outcome of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment will be a practical step in mobilizing\r\nnational and international resources to solve these\r\nproblems.\r\nWe also intend to take practical steps to resolve a\r\nset of environmental protection issues. As a country\r\nthat still suffers the pain of the Chernobyl tragedy,\r\nUkraine counts on the further active involvement of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and other\r\noperational bodies of the Organization in the process of\r\neliminating the long-term consequences of this disaster.\r\nUkraine considers that cultural and spiritual\r\ndisasters are no less destructive than natural ones. The\r\ncultural mosaic of the world is the most precious and\r\ndelicate treasure granted to humanity. Ukraine has the\r\nhonour to be one of the sponsors of the General\r\nAssembly draft resolution on the proclamation of the\r\nyear 2002 as the United Nations year for the protection\r\nof the world’s cultural heritage, and calls on the\r\ninternational community to support this initiative.\r\nVigorous work to protect humanity’s historical and\r\ncultural heritage is not only a vital necessity, it is also\r\nour moral responsibility to past and future generations.\r\nThe year 2001 is an anniversary year for our\r\ncountry. On 24 August Ukraine celebrated the first\r\ndecade of its independence. These have been 10 years\r\nof complex processes. The main result has been\r\nUkraine’s consolidation as a peaceful and independent\r\nEuropean State. We have achieved sustainable\r\neconomic growth as a result of consistent reforms, and\r\nmy country is an active participant in European\r\nregional processes.\r\nUkraine is contributing to the settlement of the\r\nso-called frozen conflicts, specifically in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia, and Transdniestria, Moldova. As a member of\r\nGroup of Friends of the Secretary-General for Georgia,\r\nUkraine is concerned over the slow pace of the\r\nGeorgia-Abkhaz peace process.\r\nUkraine takes an active stand concerning the\r\nsettlement of the situation in the Republic of\r\nMacedonia. The resolution of the centuries-old Balkan\r\nproblem is an ambitious and urgent task for Europe in\r\nthe new century.\r\nWe also note with concern the escalation of\r\ntensions in the Middle East during the past year. The\r\nentire history of the conflict in the Middle East proves\r\nthat its vicious circle can be broken only through\r\nrenouncing violence and reviving mutual trust and\r\ntolerance between the sides to the conflict.\r\nThe United Nations is beginning a new and\r\ncomplicated period of its activities. It is up to us to\r\ndetermine how the Untied Nations comes out of its\r\nencounter with the new challenges, united or divided. I\r\nbelieve that the wisdom of this forum, which has been\r\nnurtured through decades of hard and responsible work,\r\nshould serve to guarantee an optimistic scenario.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.50 p.m.\r\n"
