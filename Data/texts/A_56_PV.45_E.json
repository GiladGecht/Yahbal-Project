(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by General Pervez Musharraf, President of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President and Chief Executive of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan.\r\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, President of the\r\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency General Pervez Musharraf,\r\nPresident and Chief Executive of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Pakistan, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Musharraf (Pakistan): I would like to\r\nextend to you, Mr. President, my felicitations on your\r\nelection. I also wish to congratulate your predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for his stewardship of the\r\nmillennium session of the General Assembly. Deep\r\nappreciation is also due to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his untiring efforts to translate the\r\nvision of the Millennium Declaration into policies and\r\nactions by the world community.\r\nMr. Secretary-General, please also accept my\r\nheartiest congratulations on the award of the centenary\r\nNobel Peace Prize conferred upon you and your\r\nOrganization, and on your election for a second term to\r\nyour prestigious office.\r\nLast year, at the Millennium Summit, all of us\r\nwere looking forward to a renaissance in the new\r\nmillennium — a renaissance in the hearts and minds of\r\npeople, for a better world where peace and justice\r\nwould prevail. Unfortunately, today we gather against\r\nthe sombre backdrop of the terrorist outrage that the\r\nworld witnessed in shock and horror on that fateful day\r\nof 11 September. In seconds, images of fire and death\r\nreached all of us around the globe. Thousands of\r\ninnocent lives were lost in minutes. Eighty or more\r\nnations lost some of their brightest and their best.\r\nPakistan, like the rest of the world, mourned the\r\ncolossal loss of innocent lives. The map of the world\r\nchanged, and the entire globe descended into a deep\r\ncrisis. At a time of such great turmoil, when there is a\r\nneed for clear thought and firm action, I come from\r\nPakistan with a message of determination and resolve\r\nas well as a message of peace for all peoples.\r\nThe General Assembly meets this year under the\r\nshadow of a horrendous act of terror perpetrated\r\nagainst the people of the United States — an act for\r\nwhich no grievance or cause can ever be a justification,\r\nan act that must be condemned unambiguously and in\r\nthe strongest words. This was an attack on humanity\r\nitself and we all must therefore unite to fight this\r\nscourge. Pakistan has followed words with actions.\r\nNow that the world has committed itself to fight\r\nagainst terrorism, it is time for introspection. In this\r\ndark hour, we owe it to posterity to shed light on some\r\ndangerous and growing trends, misconceptions and\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nmisperceptions which, if not countered, may lead the\r\nworld into even greater disorder and disharmony.\r\nMuslims in various parts of the world, and the\r\nreligion of Islam itself, are being held responsible for\r\nthe trials the world is facing. This point of view is\r\ntotally misplaced. Just as all religions teach peace and\r\nlove for fellow beings, so Islam places upon its\r\nadherents the obligation to do good, to be generous,\r\nmerciful, kind and just to all fellow beings. The\r\nMuslim greeting “Assalam alaikum”, meaning “Peace\r\nbe with you”, symbolizes the very essence of the\r\nIslamic faith. Islam is a religion of peace, compassion\r\nand tolerance.\r\nTerrorism is not a Christian, Buddhist, Jewish or\r\nMuslim belief. It is to be condemned no matter who the\r\nperpetrator, be it an individual, a group or a state.\r\nWe need to ask ourselves what really causes these\r\nextreme acts around the world. To my mind, it is\r\nunresolved political disputes: disputes in Bosnia,\r\nKosovo, Palestine, Kashmir and other places.\r\nUnfortunately, all these disputes involve Muslims and,\r\nwhat is more sad, Muslims happen to be the victims in\r\nall of them. This fact tends to give a religious tinge to\r\nthese otherwise political disputes. The lack of progress\r\nin resolving them has created in Muslims a sense of\r\ndeprivation, hopelessness and powerlessness.\r\nThe frustration grows even worse when disputes\r\nlike those relating to Kashmir and Palestine, which\r\nhave been the subject of Security Council resolutions,\r\nremain unsettled. The question then becomes, are the\r\npeople asking for their rights in accordance with\r\nUnited Nations resolutions to be called terrorists, or are\r\nthe countries refusing to implement United Nations\r\nresolutions perpetrators of State terrorism? In Kashmir,\r\nIndian occupation forces have killed over 75,000\r\nKashmiris, attributing these killings to foreign\r\nterrorists. It is time that India stopped such deceit.\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions on\r\nKashmir must be implemented.\r\nMedia images of the Palestinian child,\r\nMohammed Al-Durra, were etched into the hearts and\r\nminds of people all over the world. It is perverse to\r\nregard the rape of Kashmiri women as a punishment\r\ninflicted in the course of war. The images of those\r\nmoments when the World Trade Centre towers came\r\ndown will remain definitive for all the agony, disbelief\r\nand loss that people suffer from acts of terror all over\r\nthe world. All forms of terror must be condemned,\r\nprevented and fought against, but in condemning them\r\nthe world must not trample upon the genuine rights,\r\naspirations and urges of the people who are fighting for\r\ntheir liberation and are subjected to State terrorism.\r\nTo fight the extremist, deprive him of his\r\nmotivation. The extremist survives in an environment\r\nwhere millions suffer injustice and indignity. Deprive\r\nhim of his support by giving all the peoples of the\r\nworld peace, security, justice and dignity, regardless of\r\nfaith, religion or creed.\r\nA just and honourable solution for the people of\r\nKashmir and an end to the miseries of the people of\r\nPalestine are the major burning issues that have to be\r\naddressed vigorously, boldly, imaginatively and\r\nurgently. We must get to the root causes; cosmetic\r\nsolutions will only make matters worse. Consider the\r\nanalogy of a tree: terrorists are like so many leaves —\r\ntake out some, and there will be plenty more, an\r\nunending growth. Terrorist networks are branches:\r\nprune a few, and there will be others, and further\r\ngrowth. The only way to do deal with them is to go for\r\nthe roots. Eliminate the roots, and there will be no tree.\r\nThe roots are the causes, which need to be addressed,\r\ntackled and eliminated, fairly, justly and honourably, so\r\nas to give people back their dignity, self-respect and\r\nhonour.\r\nIn essence, therefore, to tackle the issue of\r\nterrorism in its entirety, we need to follow a\r\nthree-pronged strategy of going for individual\r\nterrorists; moving against terrorist organizations; and\r\naddressing disputes throughout the world in a just\r\nmanner.\r\nAfter the events of 11 September, Pakistan took a\r\ndeliberate, principled decision to join the world\r\ncoalition in its fight against terrorism. This decision\r\nhas catapulted us, once again, into the position of being\r\na front-line State in the battle against terrorism. While\r\nthe people of Pakistan have accepted this new reality,\r\nthey still suffer from a sense of betrayal and\r\nabandonment as a result of being left in the lurch in\r\n1989 after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.\r\nThen, too, we were a front-line State — and what we\r\ngot in return was 3 million refugees, a shattered\r\neconomy, drugs and a Kalashnikov culture, to be dealt\r\nwith single-handedly and through our own limited\r\nresources. Pakistan only hopes that the mistakes of the\r\npast will not be repeated and that Pakistan’s legitimate\r\nconcerns will be addressed. Our economy again faces a\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\ncrisis from the fallout from the operations in\r\nAfghanistan. We need financial and commercial\r\nsupport on an urgent basis, and hope that this will be\r\nforthcoming.\r\nAfter the events of 11 September, and after\r\nOsama bin Laden and Al Qaeda became an\r\ninternational issue, Pakistan tried its utmost, up to the\r\nlast moment, to work with the Afghan Government so\r\nas to avert military action in Afghanistan. Regrettably,\r\nwe did not meet with success, and the coalition\r\noperation against terrorists in Afghanistan continues,\r\nwith no immediate end in sight. Sadly, the civilian\r\ncasualties resulting from this action are increasingly\r\ndepicted as an open war against the already poor,\r\nsuffering and innocent people of Afghanistan. The\r\nworld in general, and Pakistan in particular, mourn the\r\nloss of these innocent lives, and sympathize with the\r\nbereaved. It is desirable that the military operation be\r\nas short and as accurately targeted as possible. It is also\r\nessential that a fall-back political strategy be evolved\r\nwhich could attain the same objectives as those being\r\nsought through military application.\r\nIn its entirety, dealing with Afghanistan involves\r\na three-pronged strategy to address military, political\r\nand humanitarian-cum-rehabilitation issues. It must\r\nremain the effort of the coalition, after achieving its\r\nmilitary objectives, to prevent a vacuum leading to\r\nanarchy, through the immediate application of joint\r\npolitical and rehabilitation strategies.\r\nIn our view, the political set-up in Afghanistan\r\nmust be home-grown and not imposed — and I say that\r\nhaving knowledge of the Afghan psyche. We must\r\nensure the unity and territorial integrity of Afghanistan,\r\nwithin a broad-based, multi-ethnic dispensation,\r\nrepresentative of the demographic composition of the\r\ncountry.\r\nThe people of Afghanistan have been suffering\r\nthe ravages and devastation of conflict for over two\r\ndecades. It is the moral obligation of the world\r\ncommunity to support them generously. Assistance to\r\nAfghanistan should be in two forms: first, ongoing\r\nhumanitarian assistance; and secondly, post-military\r\noperations, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\r\nTo offset the ill-effects of the ongoing military\r\noperation, it is imperative that we launch a more\r\ncoordinated and concerted humanitarian relief effort\r\ninside and outside Afghanistan, with more generous\r\nfunding. This will go a long way to alleviating the\r\nsufferings of the common Afghan.\r\nIt is equally important that we, concurrently,\r\nformulate a post-operation rehabilitation programme\r\nfor when peace returns to Afghanistan. This effort\r\nwould entail, at the minimum, the restoration of water-\r\nmanagement systems; the revival of agriculture through\r\nland development; the reconstruction of the physical\r\ninfrastructure — roads, buildings and utilities; and the\r\nestablishment of institutions.\r\nA stable and peaceful Afghanistan is in the vital\r\ninterests of the region and, in particular, of Pakistan.\r\nConditions must be created for the more than 3 million\r\nrefugees in Pakistan to return to their country. We\r\npropose the establishment of an “Afghan trust fund”,\r\nunder United Nations auspices, for the rehabilitation\r\nand reconstruction effort.\r\nI would now like to focus on the harsh realities in\r\nthe developing countries, which have a relationship\r\nwith extremism of all kinds. Poverty and deprivation\r\nlead to frustration, making the masses vulnerable to\r\nexploitation by extremist organizations. It is the\r\ncollective moral responsibility of the developed world\r\nto address this issue squarely, through substantive\r\neconomic uplift, poverty alleviation and social action\r\nprogrammes in the developing countries. Economic\r\nimbalances have to be removed in order to achieve a\r\njust, equitable and harmonious world order. A major\r\nstep in this direction would be to reduce, if not\r\neliminate, the debt burden, which hangs like a\r\nmillstone around the necks of the poor and the\r\nunderdeveloped.\r\nThe bigger tragedy of the third world is that their\r\nrulers, together with their minions, plunder their\r\ncountries’ wealth and are afforded easy access to safe\r\nhavens to stash away the loot in the first world.\r\nRestrictions have long been imposed on the laundering\r\nof drug money, and the money supply for terrorists is\r\nbeing choked off. Why can similar restrictions not be\r\nimposed on the money-laundering of loot?\r\nI appeal, through this forum, to all of the\r\ndeveloped countries to legislate against deposits of ill-\r\ngotten money, to assist in investigating the looters and\r\nto ensure the early return of the plundered wealth to its\r\ncountries of origin. In fact, I would not be far off the\r\nmark if I were to state that, with the return of this\r\nlooted money, many of the developing countries might\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nbe able to pay back their debts and revive their\r\neconomies.\r\nPakistan is deeply conscious of the nuclear\r\ndimension of the security environment of our region,\r\nthe danger it poses and the responsibility it places on\r\nnuclear-weapon States, particularly the two nuclear\r\nStates in South Asia. We are ready to discuss how\r\nPakistan and India can create a stable South Asian\r\nsecurity mechanism through the peaceful resolution of\r\ndisputes, the preservation of the nuclear and\r\nconventional balance, confidence-building measures\r\nand the non-use of force, as prescribed by the United\r\nNations Charter. In this context, we are ready to\r\ndiscuss nuclear and missile restraints, as well as\r\nnuclear risk-reduction measures, with India, in a\r\nstructured, comprehensive and integrated dialogue.\r\nPakistan is fully aware of the responsibilities of\r\nits nuclear status. We have declared a unilateral\r\nmoratorium on nuclear testing. Pakistan was not the\r\nfirst to initiate nuclear tests and will not be the first to\r\nresume them. We are ready to formalize a bilateral\r\ntreaty with India for a mutual test ban. We have\r\nstrengthened our export controls and have established\r\nmulti-layered custodial controls on all our nuclear\r\nassets. Let me assure the Assembly that our strategic\r\nassets are very well guarded and in very safe hands. We\r\nare constantly upgrading our command and control\r\nmeasures, and we have instituted an elaborate nuclear\r\ncommand and control mechanism for ironclad custodial\r\ncontrols to ensure the safety and security of all our\r\nassets. Pakistan is opposed to an arms race in South\r\nAsia, be it nuclear or conventional. We will maintain\r\ndeterrence at the minimum level. We want to live in the\r\nregion with honour and with dignity.\r\nI would now like to very briefly cover internal\r\ndevelopments in Pakistan. Over the past two years, the\r\nfocus has been on economic revival, poverty\r\nalleviation, the improvement of governance in\r\nPakistan, political restructuring and the introduction of\r\ngenuine democracy in the country. We have\r\nsuccessfully put in place a sound democratic structure\r\nthat is based on empowerment of the people at the\r\ngrassroots level. A revolutionary step has been taken\r\nthrough the provision of one third of the seats to\r\nwomen on the district-level governing councils.\r\nI want to put on record at this gathering that\r\nPakistan is proud of this representation and\r\nempowerment of women, which is a unique feature in\r\nthe world. Our resolve to hold elections to the\r\nProvincial and National Assemblies and to the Senate\r\nin October 2002, in accordance with the road map I\r\nannounced last August, will remain unchanged in spite\r\nof the prevailing environment in the region.\r\nIn conclusion, and in view of the fact that we are\r\ngoing through a time of enormous trials and\r\ntribulations, I wish to make an appeal — an appeal for\r\nthe sake of mankind, for the sake of our future\r\ngenerations and for the sake of a better world.\r\nLet justice prevail; let no people be wronged; let\r\nsuffering be eliminated; let discontent be addressed; let\r\nhumanity rise as one nation to eliminate subjugation of\r\nthe weak; and let there be peace.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President and Chief\r\nExecutive of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, President and Chief\r\nExecutive of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrés Pastrana Arango, President\r\nof the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMr. Andrés Pastrana Arango, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Andrés Pastrana Arango,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Pastrana Arango (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me, on behalf of the Government of Colombia,\r\nto express our satisfaction at your assumption of the\r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly.\r\nYour experience and leadership are valuable credentials\r\nfor bringing our deliberations to a fruitful result. I wish\r\nalso to pay tribute to your predecessor, the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs of Finland, His Excellency Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, whose diplomatic skills contributed decisively\r\nto the Assembly’s work.\r\nI want, further, to speak of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, whose authority, dedication and\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nmeaningful contribution will serve as inspiration for\r\nthe decisions that Member States must take at this\r\nsession.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to reiterate our\r\nsatisfaction at the honour accorded to the United\r\nNations and to the Secretary-General through the\r\naward of the Nobel Peace Prize. That was a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to our Organization, to the values\r\nshared by its Member States, and, in particular, to the\r\nSecretary General, whose personal commitment and\r\nvisionary approach have given new life to the United\r\nNations and have helped to consolidate its international\r\ncredibility. That decision was more than an\r\nacknowledgement of past achievements; it provided\r\nencouragement that inspires the work of the United\r\nNations in the light of the challenges of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nTwo months ago the entire world was shaken by a\r\nseries of unprecedented terrorist acts. We have all\r\nspoken of the dreadful effects of these attacks. We have\r\nall expressed our solidarity to the people of the United\r\nStates. And we all agree that those irrational acts not\r\nonly affected one single country but were in fact an\r\nattack against all mankind. But we must go even\r\nfurther; we must understand why such events occurred\r\nand what we must do to ensure that similar acts never\r\nhappen again – never again.\r\nThe tragedy of 11 September had the positive\r\neffect of uniting us all against a common enemy:\r\nterrorism. And it did something else: it removed the\r\ndissembling from our words; it stripped the hypocrisy\r\nfrom our discourse; it moved us out of the world of\r\ngrey tones to which we were so accustomed. Now we\r\nmust work to replace it with a black-and-white world\r\nthat is free of ambiguity.\r\nAnd what were those greys that are so evident\r\ntoday? They were the ambiguities we all expressed in\r\nrespect of violence and the money that finances it. In\r\nthe past, when an act against civilians anywhere in the\r\nworld suited our interests, we would speak of a\r\nhumanitarian crisis, of defending democracy, of\r\nreasons of State. And we continued on impassively,\r\nwith a clear conscience. But when an act against\r\ncivilians anywhere did not suit our interests, we would\r\ntake a firm stand, we would react with indignation and\r\nwe would speak of terrorism, of attacks against\r\nmankind, of treacherous attacks against democracy and\r\nhuman rights.\r\nLet there be no more ambiguity or equivocation.\r\nThe time has come to define our position, with no\r\nvague half answers: either we side with mankind, its\r\ndignity and its integrity, or we do not.\r\nWhenever human dignity or civilians are\r\nattacked, that is an act of terrorism. It does not matter\r\nwhether it is perpetrated by a group of religious\r\nfanatics or by an organization claiming to have\r\npolitical ideals. There is no pretext for attacking\r\ndefenceless civilians. The dividing line is very clear:\r\neither we respect human life and dignity or we stand\r\nagainst humankind.\r\nThe horrendous acts of 11 September do not\r\nrepresent a collision of civilizations, religions or\r\ncultures. The only collision is between a violent\r\nfanatical minority on the one hand, and all forms of\r\ncivilization on the other. We cannot accept any further\r\nattempts to justify violence. No matter how much it\r\ncosts us — even if it goes against our present\r\ninterests — there is something far more valuable than\r\nanything else in the world: human life and human\r\ndignity.\r\nToday, we must all stand together and\r\nunreservedly condemn all acts of violence against any\r\nhuman being, regardless of the pretext. If we do not\r\ncast our lot in favour of mankind and human values,\r\nwhat will be left for us? What right will we have to call\r\nourselves the leaders of a civilization gone adrift?\r\nI address the Assembly today with the\r\noverwhelming responsibility and authority vested in me\r\nas President of a country, Colombia, that for decades\r\nhas endured an internal conflict where every new day\r\nbrings more deaths and kidnappings because of the\r\nintransigence of illegal groups seeking to impose\r\nthemselves at the cost of the lives of their compatriots.\r\nAnd I address the Assembly today representing a\r\ncountry, Colombia, that has been the main victim of\r\nworldwide drug addiction, a country that has suffered\r\ntoo many deaths, that has sacrificed natural and\r\nfinancial resources to combat a crime that is not its\r\nown. It is a global crime whose vast illegal proceeds\r\nremain outside our borders.\r\nIn those two capacities, I address the international\r\ncommunity, represented in the General Assembly, to\r\ndemand, head held high, that we move from rhetoric to\r\naction. The world is distressed by this ominous\r\nterrorism. I say candidly that we ourselves have also\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nsuffered from such terrorism for quite some time. But\r\nwe have not always felt the pulse of the international\r\ncommunity beating firmly by our side.\r\nWe all know that the world market for illegal\r\ndrugs is the number-one source of financing for\r\nworldwide terrorism and death. Yet the international\r\ncommunity has been content simply to suggest or\r\ndemand that production centres control drug trafficking\r\nthrough law enforcement and through eradication and\r\ninterdiction action, forgetting that this scourge is much\r\nmore than just a problem of cultivation and trafficking.\r\nIt is a global problem with global ramifications.\r\nColombia has always said, and my Government\r\nhas repeated again and again in every possible\r\ninternational forum, that it is necessary to control\r\nillegal drug production, but that we cannot forget that\r\nthis is a very complex transnational business and that\r\nthe vast proceeds of narcotics trafficking do not stay in\r\nour country. No, indeed: those profits move freely\r\nthrough international financial markets where\r\nseemingly respectable financiers and businessmen\r\nprosper, enjoying the tolerance of the entire world.\r\nWe must also learn from our misfortunes —\r\nespecially from our misfortunes — and we have\r\nlearned something from the events of 11 September.\r\nWe have learned that lax control of financial\r\ninstitutions and the existence of tax and banking\r\nhavens are like giving criminals a letter of marque to\r\nmake and multiply their profits, to amass the fortunes\r\nthat finance death.\r\nThe shared responsibility that my country\r\ndemands in the fight against illegal drugs must also be\r\napplied to the fight against terrorism. This new\r\ninternational conviction that we have all been late in\r\nimplementing — perhaps because we are still numbed\r\nby the so-called post-cold-war era — must be\r\ntranslated into acts that go beyond rhetoric. There must\r\nbe no more coexisting with money laundering, even if\r\nit means going after the major financial conglomerates\r\nof the world.\r\nThere must be no more uncontrolled production\r\nand sale of the chemical precursors used in illicit drug\r\nproduction.\r\nThere must be no more illegal or uncontrolled\r\nmanufacturing and sale of the weapons that propagate\r\ndeath.\r\nOnly if we, beginning with the developed\r\ncountries, translate those principles into reality, with\r\nconcrete action and with political will, will we give\r\nmeaning and effectiveness to the fight that my country,\r\nColombia, has been waging for many years against the\r\ncultivation and production of drugs.\r\nNo country is free from the destructive\r\nconsequences of illegal drugs. There are no epicentres\r\nin this illegal business. This criminal activity is global\r\nin nature. The drug problem, and organized crime in\r\ngeneral, undermine the institutional framework,\r\nconspire against democracy, compromise governance\r\nand sow death and violence. They are a hothouse of\r\ncorruption; they erode judicial systems and they thwart\r\nthe rule of law. Shared responsibility, therefore, means\r\nthe responsibility to defend democracy, our principles\r\nand institutions.\r\nThe year 2003 will mark five years since the\r\ntwentieth special session of the General Assembly, the\r\nso-called world drug summit. We should now begin to\r\npromote an in-depth review of all the accomplishments,\r\nthe obstacles encountered along the way, the new\r\nchallenges to be faced and the additional action we\r\nmust take to break, once and for all, the links that\r\nsupport this global phenomenon.\r\nBut we must do so without losing ourselves in\r\ngrey tones. The commitment of the international\r\ncommunity must be real and concrete so that we can at\r\nlast attack the finances of the traffickers of death. Let\r\nus combat the business in which they make all their\r\nprofits.\r\nFortunately, the Security Council has taken\r\nimportant decisions in this regard, moving the fight\r\nagainst crime in the right direction. Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) and the measures being taken\r\nby all the Governments of the world to combat the\r\nfinancing of international terrorism are an essential\r\nstep forward that Colombia supports without hesitation.\r\nWe must work together to dismantle the structure\r\nof the extremists’ financial support. That is the only\r\nway to create a safer world for our children. It is the\r\nonly way to defeat the plague of violence and terrorism\r\nat its roots: the transnational empires of drugs.\r\nA year ago, we gathered in this same Hall on the\r\noccasion of the Millennium Summit. None of the\r\npriorities identified at that time was stressed as much\r\nas the need to ensure that globalization benefits all the\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\npeoples of the world. The reality of globalization is one\r\nof inequality; it has led to dissatisfaction and conflict.\r\nWe need, through deep reflection, to become aware of\r\nour responsibility for humanizing globalization and\r\nensuring that it reflects the interests of all countries and\r\nregions.\r\nThe Conference on Financing for Development to\r\nbe held early next year in Mexico is particularly\r\nimportant in this light. Unless we mobilize the\r\nnecessary financial resources and move towards a new\r\narchitecture ensuring a stable international financial\r\nsystem, the commitments and the course set out at the\r\nMillennium Summit will be a dead letter.\r\nThose same criteria must guide next year’s World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.\r\nOn that occasion, we must consolidate a positive vision\r\nand devise a road map for achieving real harmony\r\nbetween economic growth, social development and the\r\npreservation of the environment.\r\nThis is the last time I will address the General\r\nAssembly as President of Colombia. Each year since\r\n1998, I have spoken before the Assembly about the\r\ncommitment of my Government and of the people of\r\nColombia to achieving peace, democracy and progress\r\nin social justice.\r\nMore than any other leader of my country I have\r\nfully devoted myself to achieving peace. I do not regret\r\nhaving done that, because we Colombians are tired of\r\nviolence, intimidation, crime and kidnappings. I hope\r\nthat all groups living outside the law will make the\r\nright choice at this crucial juncture, not only in the\r\nhistory of Colombia but also in the history of all\r\nhumankind. It is up to them to decide how they want to\r\nbe treated: as terrorists and drug-traffickers or as\r\npolitical insurgents. They must define themselves\r\nthrough their actions. If their actions lead them to be\r\ntreated as mere terrorists, then they must clearly\r\nunderstand — and I say this vehemently to the\r\nworld — that Colombia and the international\r\ncommunity will honour their commitments and carry\r\nout the measures adopted by the Security Council to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nHistory goes on; it does not stop. Leaders come\r\nand go, but peoples continue along the path laid out\r\nbefore them. Even today, I believe that peace is\r\npossible if the will to make peace exists. I still believe,\r\nwith the firm hope of someone who knows the values\r\nof his people, that the road we started on will not be\r\nbarren.\r\nDuring my mandate, the international community\r\nhas shown an unprecedented solidarity with the people\r\nof Colombia and its quest for peace. I am grateful for\r\nthat from the bottom of my heart.\r\nI must give special recognition to the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s Special Adviser on International Assistance\r\nto Colombia, Jan Egeland, for his assistance, and to the\r\ngenerous contribution of friendly nations during the\r\ntalks with insurgent groups. The world has sided with\r\npeace in Colombia, and that is a gesture we understand\r\nand appreciate in its full worth.\r\nToday I echo the strong and determined voice of\r\n40 million Colombians, who are all fighting for a better\r\nand more dignified life, and I reaffirm before the world\r\na message to the international community that proposes\r\nand demands clarity.\r\nThe time for lamenting is over. It is time for\r\ndefinitions.\r\nLet us put aside the empty speeches. Let us leave\r\nbehind the moral double standards that measure acts\r\nthat suit us with one yardstick and the acts that do not\r\nwith another. Let us advance, united together, against\r\nall forms of terrorism, whatever their rationales.\r\nNo more ambiguity. No more justifications of\r\nviolence. Let us never forget that there is nothing more\r\nsacred, more valuable or worthier than human life.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrés Pastrana Arango, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alejandro Toledo\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nManrique, President of the Republic of Peru, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Toledo Manrique (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThis is the first time I have had the privilege of\r\naddressing this prestigious world forum. To arrive here,\r\nI travelled a long road. I was born in a small village\r\nhigh in the Andes, at an altitude of nearly 4,000 metres\r\nabove sea level. Like millions of brothers from our\r\ncontinent of Latin America, I know first-hand the hard\r\nface of poverty.\r\nTo survive, in my childhood, I sold newspapers,\r\nlottery tickets and shined the shoes in which others\r\nwalked.\r\nToday, I have come before this world assembly as\r\nthe constitutional President of Peru, bringing the\r\nstories, the hopes and the dreams of millions of\r\nPeruvians.\r\nI come from a country that is heir to an ancient\r\nculture and the cradle of great civilizations. I come to\r\nlead our present with responsibility and to construct\r\nour future with vision. Thus, in these few brief\r\nminutes, I would like to share with the Assembly three\r\nsubjects that are of the greatest concern to my\r\nGovernment:\r\nFirst of all, I would like to be clear about one\r\nthing: we are engaged in a head-on struggle against\r\nterrorism and its perverse alliance with drug trafficking\r\nand corruption. These are scourges for which there can\r\nbe no room for ambiguity. With the same\r\ndetermination, however, I need to point out that the\r\nworld is facing the enormous challenge of mustering\r\nthe necessary clear vision so as not to put off the\r\nhuman development agenda, which in large measure is\r\nthe underlying principle of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, there is the need to reduce military\r\nexpenditures in Latin America and in the world, so that\r\nthese resources can be channelled instead into a direct\r\nfight against poverty.\r\nThirdly, we need to think and act together in\r\ndealing with the world economic situation to protect\r\nemployment opportunities and income for the poorest.\r\nThere can be no real democracy without sustained\r\neconomic growth that will generate decent jobs.\r\nBarely a year ago, Peru was enmeshed in a\r\ndramatic struggle between a corrupt dictatorship and\r\nthe hopes for democracy of the vast majority of the\r\nPeruvian people. Faced with this situation, we\r\nPeruvians stood up and proved capable of mobilizing\r\nourselves and peacefully struggling to regain our\r\ndemocracy and our freedom. On behalf of millions of\r\nmen and women of my country, I would like to thank\r\nthe peoples and Governments of the world for their\r\nfriendship, active role and solidarity in helping us\r\nregain our democracy.\r\nToday, Peru has now begun a new democratic\r\ndawn. We are aware, however, that we have great\r\nresponsibilities. We must strengthen a full-fledged\r\ndemocracy and our still fragile institutions and\r\nreactivate our economy so as to achieve sustainable\r\ngrowth that will generate decent and productive jobs.\r\nWe must strengthen our institutions and defeat poverty,\r\nwhich form an indissoluble part of the same goal,\r\nbecause poverty, corruption and drug trafficking\r\nconspire against democracy. We can now declare, here\r\nbefore the international community, that the time has\r\ncome to give a human face to globalization, so that\r\ncompetitiveness becomes permanent.\r\nWe Peruvians have freshly inscribed in our\r\ncollective memory a horror of terrorism. During the 20\r\nyears of terror, Peru has lost 25,000 human lives, which\r\nhas cost more than $30 billion and has left the poor\r\neven poorer. That is why I reaffirm our deep solidarity\r\nwith the people and Government of the United States in\r\nthe face of the insanity of terror of 11 September. This\r\nwas not an attack against the United States alone. It\r\nwas an attack against the peoples that believe in peace\r\nand democracy, for all our differences of opinion.\r\nWe are determined to take unambiguous actions\r\nto fight terrorism. We shall do so in the spirit of respect\r\nfor religious freedoms and ethnic identity. We will\r\nactively contribute to the work that has been entrusted\r\nto the ad hoc Committee of the Security Council,\r\nmaking available to it the experts that may be\r\nnecessary to intelligently fight the threat of\r\ninternational terrorism within the framework of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter and the decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAt an inter-American multilateral forum, we\r\nmade an effective contribution. This week we\r\nintroduced before the Organization of American States\r\na draft convention against terrorism. In keeping with\r\nthis purpose, this morning we deposited at the\r\nSecretary-General’s office the following instruments:\r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court; the\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings; and the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\r\nThus, my country has become a party to all\r\ninternational treaties against terrorism.\r\nOur States must build up an extensive network of\r\nobligations to effectively cooperate in the judicial,\r\npolice, information and financial fields to facilitate the\r\ncapture and extradition of the perpetrators of crimes\r\nagainst humanity or of acts of corruption that lead to\r\nsuch crimes. Human rights violations and corruption\r\nare two sides of the same coin. They spell impunity.\r\nIt would not be possible to face up to corruption\r\nwithout linking it with the fight against drug trafficking\r\nand money laundering. We are working hard in this\r\nregard. We have established high-level authorities\r\ndirectly under the head of State to wage the fight\r\nagainst drug trafficking and corruption.\r\nI know that this is a decision that impinges upon\r\npowerful interests. We shall not be swayed from our\r\ndetermination. Peru is now seeking to re-establish\r\ndemocracy to the fullest. We are aware, however, that\r\nthere are powerful forces hidden in the shadows,\r\nwhich, with certain political accomplices, are trying to\r\nachieve impunity for the corruption committed during\r\nthe decade of Montesinos and Fujimori. That is why,\r\naddressing you from this prestigious forum, I call on\r\nthe international community not to allow, as the\r\nglobalization of justice process, for capricious\r\ninterpretation of certain national laws that trivialize\r\nactions or allow for the granting of impunity.\r\nThere is no justification for a democratic\r\ngovernment to sacrifice development of the poor for\r\nthe sake of an arms race. Therefore, the second issue\r\ncentral to our foreign policy is our proposal, which we\r\nput to the Heads of State and Government of Latin\r\nAmerica, for an immediate freeze on the purchase of\r\noffensive weapons in the region. We also seek an\r\nagreement among the countries of Latin America to\r\nreduce their military expenditures and to reorient their\r\nfinancial resources towards investment in nutrition,\r\nhealth and education.\r\nPeru has recently achieved important agreements\r\non this issue with the brotherly countries of Chile and\r\nEcuador and is promoting an understanding among the\r\nother countries of our region that will allow us to\r\nembark together on the path towards the reduction of\r\npoverty there. Peace is not only the silence of guns; it\r\nshould also mean dignity for the poor. This proposal is\r\naimed at the adoption of a broad regional framework to\r\nreduce military spending. However, might we not also\r\nconsider expanding this proposal, which is not a new\r\none, to other regions around the globe? We must invest\r\nin the great enterprise of knowledge — in the minds of\r\nour people. That means investing more, and more\r\nwisely, in nutrition, health and education.\r\nThe third item relates to our concern about the\r\nglobal economy. We regret the onset of recession in the\r\nmost important developed economies, which is\r\nshrinking markets, eliminating jobs and thus hindering\r\nthe implementation of the measures set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. There is an urgent need to\r\ncontrol the damage being done to the poor economies\r\nby the current global economic crisis. It is therefore\r\nimportant that the next round of the World Trade\r\nOrganization not be an aseptic commercial round. It\r\nshould be a round on behalf of the poorest, avoiding\r\nprotectionist policies for the agricultural sector of the\r\nindustrialized countries and allowing the textile\r\nindustry to create good jobs in our countries.\r\nI call on the people of the world to embark\r\nunflinchingly and without fear on the path towards a\r\nfuture of peace and democracy, without terrorism,\r\nwithout violations of human rights and without\r\nimpunity. I am convinced that, together, we can build a\r\nglobalized, competitive yet united world with a human\r\nface. In that respect, Peru assumes its responsibility\r\ntoday before the General Assembly.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Peru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alejandro Toledo Manrique, President of the\r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Milan Kučan, President of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Milan Kučan, President of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome His\r\nExcellency, Mr. Milan Kučan, President of the\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nRepublic of Slovenia, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Kučan (spoke in Slovenian;\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): All our\r\nadmiration goes to the United States for making\r\npossible the normal work of the United Nations and the\r\nsessions of the General Assembly despite the recent\r\ntragic events and all their global consequences. The\r\ntragic crime, which affected the whole world, has\r\nbrutally confronted us with new, very serious and long-\r\nterm issues. This year’s general debate is thus an\r\nopportunity and a new and great responsibility for us\r\nall — a responsibility that must be accepted. Words of\r\ncondemnation and solidarity cannot be enough.\r\nAs we sympathize profoundly with the American\r\npeople, we must also tell the world in one voice that we\r\nshall be deliberately and effectively allied in the future,\r\ntoo, and that we will cooperate in the fight against\r\nterrorism and in the eradication of the roots of that evil.\r\nWe will responsibly consider joint measures for a\r\nworld of more peace, greater freedom, solidarity and\r\nsecurity and more social justice for every person and\r\nevery nation, as well as ever less room for violence.\r\nThe idea of such a world requires us to avoid the\r\nvortex of evil by undertaking a considered and resolute\r\nresponse to the terrorist crime that was committed. The\r\nimmediate decisive military reaction of the United\r\nStates of America and other countries of the anti-\r\nterrorist alliance was imperative.\r\nWe cannot simply rest at that, however. The\r\nvortex of violence could threaten the democratic values\r\nthat humanity has set over its long development as the\r\nmeasure of life in human society. That is why we are\r\nultimately obliged to avoid dividing cultures along the\r\nprinciple of “us versus them”, dividing races, religions\r\nand nations into the categories of civilized and\r\nbarbaric, and ascribing a priori fundamentalism to any\r\nreligion or civilization. The United Nations has\r\nproclaimed this year the Year of Dialogue Among\r\nCivilizations. We should seize this opportunity.\r\nThe contemporary world is diverse, but all\r\nmodern civilizations, cultures and major religions\r\nrespect human dignity and human life. Killing is an\r\naberration anywhere in the world. Sadly, human and\r\nsocial pathology have made killing a lucrative business\r\nand given international terrorism its own internal\r\ndynamic. The instigators and perpetrators of these\r\ndespicable acts must be brought to justice, while it is\r\nthe responsibility of politics to remove the social and\r\npolitical roots of this evil. It is the universal values of\r\nall contemporary civilizations, such as the sanctity of\r\nlife and respect for human dignity, that enable the\r\ncreation of a global democracy based on a global ethos.\r\nResolute action and attention must focus on those\r\ngroups and individuals throughout the world who\r\nbrutally violate these principles and bring chaos,\r\nmurder and madness into our human world. Sadly,\r\nthere are enough such people in all cultures and\r\ncivilizations in all parts of the human world, including\r\nthe Christian world. They warn us that the global world\r\nrequires a different perception of the world and its\r\ndilemmas, especially of the unequal distribution of\r\npoverty and wealth, and that it raises questions to\r\nwhich there are as yet no answers.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit last year, we came\r\nvery close to a realistic analysis of some of the major\r\neconomic, financial, social, cultural, political and\r\necological effects of the global economy. We have\r\ncome closer to the important understanding that a\r\nglobal world also requires global responsibility, and\r\nthat starts with the responsibility of each State.\r\nStates cannot arbitrarily do things that are in\r\ncomplete conflict with the values of the democratic\r\nworld. In particular, cannot systematically violate basic\r\nhuman rights and freedoms through State violence, nor\r\ncan they allow and encourage activities that threaten\r\nthe security of other countries and of the international\r\ncommunity, all in the name of their own sovereignty,\r\neven within their own boundaries. Neither can they\r\nignore such activity by others and shut themselves\r\nbehind their own borders.\r\nLast year’s position on humanitarian intervention\r\nwas the first step in this direction, yet, unfortunately,\r\nnot a sufficient one. The escalation of internationally\r\nsyndicated and organized terrorism demands that\r\nfurther steps be taken. We cannot allow terrorism and\r\ncrime to abuse the opportunities offered by our\r\nglobalized world before the democratic world itself is\r\neven in a position to put these opportunities to good\r\nuse in finding answers to completely new challenges.\r\nI see these challenges in pronounced divisions\r\nwith global implications — divisions into owners of\r\ncapital, knowledge, ideas and information\r\ntechnologies, on the one hand, and the billions\r\ncondemned to ignorance, a life of poverty and\r\nvegetating without prospects at the margins of society,\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\non the other hand, in the ever greater financial\r\nweakness of many nation-States and whole continents\r\nthat are left without development potentials or\r\nprospects. In its relentless growth in power and\r\nauthority, global capital has long since gone beyond\r\nState borders. However, it assumes no responsibility\r\nfor people’s social position and prospects for freedom\r\nand democracy, for development and the future, for\r\npeople’s security. This responsibility is left to State\r\nadministrations.\r\nI also see challenges in all kinds of\r\nfundamentalism, even in the perverted understanding\r\nof competitiveness which leads to production and\r\nservices with an ever-shrinking labour force, without\r\ncaring about people and nature, about life on the planet\r\nand its future in an economy whose only motive and\r\naim is profit.\r\nI see them also in the very pragmatically oriented\r\nnational and international politics operating in a\r\nframework of dramatic simplicity and simplification,\r\nand so their euphoric haste does not match their effect.\r\nThese are politics that ignore the dimension of time\r\nand the duration of phenomena, such as the ecological\r\neffects of genetic or biomedical interventions that are\r\nnot apparent immediately, but perhaps only in decades,\r\nonly with the coming generations.\r\nI see challenges in the neglect of a comprehensive\r\nand interconnected perspective on phenomena and\r\nprocesses and in the disregard for the way in which\r\nthey are interconnected. All modern political, social\r\nand ecological dramas and conflicts, as well as the\r\nglobal socio-pathological cancers, are a result of\r\nthe interaction of a range of social forces and\r\nelements. These phenomena — including international\r\nterrorism — which are like epidemics, cannot be\r\nconfined within the borders of one or more States. This\r\napplies to a host of phenomena, not just terrorism, but\r\nalso ecology, food, genetics, finance, the information\r\nsociety and violence.\r\nI also see challenges in the lack of\r\ncommunication between the authorities and\r\nincreasingly global civil movements. Protests from\r\nSeattle to Genoa are a powerful warning of the danger\r\nof a division into two worlds that are beginning to\r\ncommunicate solely through protests and violence.\r\nThe world today is clearly different from what it\r\nwas before. It could be better, but only with an\r\nawareness of and mechanisms for assuming global\r\nresponsibility. This will enable the search for a\r\ndynamic balance leaving no room for the chaos that\r\nuncontrolled developments and acts of terror lead to. In\r\norder to achieve this, we will have to change many\r\nthings.\r\nTherefore, adapting the United Nations to these\r\nnew circumstances is, in a way, a call of distress. It will\r\nnot be a simple task. All 189 Members and their\r\nrepresentatives are bound primarily to the sovereignty\r\nof their own States. However, the world clearly also\r\nneeds global governance. More than ever, we need the\r\nUnited Nations as a global entity common to all States,\r\nan entity that will be able, with the full authority that\r\nrests on the global responsibility of States, to take\r\nmeasures to the benefit of dynamic development, a\r\ndevelopment of balanced forces and effects of the\r\nglobal economy and globalization in general.\r\nOtherwise, we will have to state the alternative.\r\nWe must accept the recognition that every society,\r\nincluding the global one, must subordinate itself to\r\nspecific rules, or else it will be subjected to the rule of\r\ncrude force. Our difficulty is that we have overlooked\r\nthat the world has become a single society full of\r\ninternal contrasts, which in real life, especially in\r\ninternational relations, recognizes and respects few\r\nrules. What we urgently need is the common political\r\nwill to provide legitimacy to a universal system of\r\ninstitutions and bodies, to which together we have\r\nentrusted the power to prescribe common rules.\r\nWe need common political will to subject\r\nourselves to these rules and to respect them. The actual\r\npower to prescribe rules would not be only in the hands\r\nof States. Could this also be the United Nations? What\r\nreforms are needed to achieve this, in order for the\r\nUnited Nations to become this? We cannot wait with\r\nthe answers.\r\nI am also speaking from the experience of\r\nSlovenia, which I represent. In gaining independence\r\n10 years ago, we experienced brief but serious violence\r\non our own territory. In our immediate vicinity, South-\r\nEastern Europe, we were faced with one of the most\r\nbarbaric policies since the Second World War, a policy\r\nresponsible for genocide and other forms of widespread\r\nviolence. With independence, Slovenia stepped into a\r\nworld that is prepared to behave better than the self-\r\nenclosed world that the former Yugoslavia had become\r\nin the final years of its life, when the equality of rights\r\nof people and nations was violated and when hope for a\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\ndifferent future was denied. We have stepped onto the\r\npath of freedom, and Slovenia has accepted its own\r\nshare of the responsibility for our global world.\r\nI believe that this global world will tend toward a\r\ndynamic balance, provided that States — large and\r\nsmall, rich and poor, technologically developed and\r\nmarginalized — will together seek new solutions. The\r\nvenue can only be a fundamentally reformed United\r\nNations. It is within such a United Nations that both a\r\ndurable coalition against terrorism and a durable\r\ncoalition of common responsibility of all countries for\r\na world with more solidarity and social justice for all\r\nhumanity and all its parts can be achieved.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Milan Kučan, President of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jorge Quiroga Ramírez, President of\r\nthe Republic of Bolivia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Bolivia.\r\nMr. Jorge Quiroga Ramírez, President of the\r\nRepublic of Bolivia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jorge Quiroga Ramírez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Quiroga Ramírez (spoke in Spanish): I\r\ncome from the city of La Paz to add Bolivia’s voice to\r\nthis universal support the United Nations has received\r\nthrough the Nobel Peace Prize. This award expresses\r\nbetter than all the speeches could possibly do the way\r\nin which the world appreciates the Organization and its\r\nSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan. The mediating role\r\nperformed by the Organization, its calls to nations to\r\nagree among themselves, the courage it has in\r\nassuming risks and the willingness it has shown to\r\noffer lives for a cause go beyond the mere performance\r\nof a duty; they are an example to all our Governments.\r\nThe active role played by the Organization is more\r\nnecessary now than ever before.\r\nThis is a time in which the evil, malignant\r\nshadow of terror is rising on the horizon as the new\r\ncentury dawns. The Berlin Wall was the symbol of\r\nideological divisions during the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century. We must now, after 11 September,\r\ntear down the wall of terrorism and intolerance that a\r\nfew people wish to raise to divide the world.\r\nOn one side of this new wall are those of us who\r\nhave built up and believe in democracy with pluralism.\r\nOn the other side are those that wish despotically to\r\nimpose their beliefs, with no respect for the rule of law.\r\nOn one side of this new wall are those of us who\r\npermit and encourage the freedom of worship and\r\nexpression. On the other side are those that do not\r\npractice, permit or tolerate it. On one side of this wall\r\nare those of us who every day try to create equality of\r\nopportunities for all women. On the other side are\r\nthose that oppress and dominate them. On one side of\r\nthis wall are those of us who value freedom above all.\r\nOn the other side are the terrorists that wish to destroy\r\nand restrict it.\r\nLet there be no doubt that Bolivia will always be\r\non the side of democracy, freedom and tolerance. We\r\nwant a life in peace and harmony. This is why my\r\nGovernment, without any hesitation, with total\r\nconviction and in all forums, has expressed its full\r\nsupport for the measures undertaken by the coalition\r\nled by the United States Government after the attacks\r\nthat took the lives of thousands of innocent people, the\r\nmajority of whom were in this very city of New York.\r\nTerrorism is to a large extent incubated in and fed\r\nby the underground world of drug trafficking. We must\r\nnot accept that in attacking freedom, terrorism\r\ndisguises itself by putting forward political claims. We\r\ncannot accept that drug traffickers, seeking to\r\nundermine our democracies, drape themselves in the\r\nmantle of legitimate social demands. It is clear that\r\nterrorism and drug trafficking are Siamese twins and\r\nenemies of the free democracies. This is why we must\r\ncombat each of them with the same vigour and\r\ndetermination.\r\nBolivia, with all its limitations, is performing its\r\ntask in fighting drug trafficking. By the will of the\r\nmajority of the Bolivians, expressed through our own\r\nnational dialogue, guided by our own interests and\r\nencouraged by our own public opinion, we are\r\nirreversibly moving forward towards eradicating illegal\r\ncoca crops used to prepare cocaine and are entering\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\ninto the final stage of the Dignity Plan, whose purpose\r\nis to remove Bolivia from the drug circuit.\r\nBut the work is not finished. International\r\nsolidarity and support are now more important than\r\never before. To complete the task, Bolivia needs\r\nsupport on two levels. First of all, the international\r\ncommunity must realize that sustained support for\r\nalternative development programmes is more necessary\r\nfor the countries that have eliminated the bulk of illegal\r\ncoca crops and cocaine, and in which many people\r\nhave been displaced as a result.\r\nBolivia has reduced more than 90 percent of its\r\nillegal coca leaf production. However obvious it may\r\nseem, this percentage must be repeated over and over,\r\nbecause many international bureaucracies allocate\r\nresources according to the size of the problem, which is\r\nmistakenly defined as the volume of production of coca\r\nleaves and cocaine, when the real economic problem\r\narises from the size of the reduction that has been\r\nachieved and the proportional reduction of the income\r\ngenerated by this activity. Bolivia deserves and needs\r\nmore support than ever before, because it has made\r\nmore progress than ever before.\r\nSecondly, and of more relevance now, it is\r\nnecessary to provide access to markets; the opportunity\r\nto fight for a place under the sun; and the right to work,\r\nproduce and sell. And here, at this point, the decision\r\nby the United States and the European Union to open\r\nup their markets to the products of alternative\r\ndevelopment takes on critical and definitive\r\nsignificance.\r\nBolivia is the least developed nation of South\r\nAmerica, the economy that is most open the region and\r\nthe only country that has achieved such a dramatic\r\nreduction in such a poisonous and harmful product as\r\ncocaine, within so short a time. For these three reasons,\r\nwe feel that we have every right to call for access to\r\nmarkets through free trade — triply free trade: free\r\nfrom tariffs, free from subsidies and free from non-\r\ntariff measures.\r\nWe need free trade, the triply free trade that\r\napplies to sectors such as telecommunications,\r\nbanking, computers and turbines, must also apply to\r\nagriculture, textiles and leather. Unfortunately, these\r\nlast three labour-intensive sectors are governed by\r\nnineteenth-century rules in the midst of the third\r\nmillennium.\r\nIn Bolivia we are moving forward with\r\ndecentralized and participatory programmes on health\r\nand education. An educated and vaccinated citizen who\r\ndoes not have a market, however, is not a full-fledged\r\ncitizen of the present-day world of ours. In Bolivia we\r\nhave straightened out and opened up our economy, but\r\nwe have not seen full reciprocity in the developed\r\nworld or on the part of our neighbours.\r\nIn Bolivia we have almost entirely eliminated the\r\nproduction of cocaine, which however harmful it might\r\nbe, was an export product that was not subject to\r\nsubsidies, barriers or tariffs. This is why we require\r\naccess to markets to guarantee the completion of the\r\nDignity Plan and avoid frustrating the will of our\r\ncitizens, who have assumed the challenge of moving\r\nfrom illegal activities to legitimate work, without,\r\nhowever, having achieved the same access to the\r\nmarket.\r\nOn the threshold of the twenty-first century, in\r\nthe midst of a severe economic and political crisis that\r\naffects all the countries of the region, Bolivia is facing\r\nanother challenge that can decisively change its future.\r\nIn the few years since the work on the most important\r\ngas pipeline of South America was completed,\r\nBolivia’s natural gas reserves grew exponentially, and\r\nhave made my country a significant player in the\r\nhemisphere-wide market. We are now serving a\r\ngrowing part of the energy demands of Brazil, and we\r\nfirmly intend to go on from here to reach the markets\r\nof the Pacific, Mexico and the United States.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September saw to it that\r\nenergy and gas integration must be based on a long-\r\nterm vision that takes into account three elements:\r\nextensive gas reserves, a reliable economy and a solid\r\ndemocracy. Bolivia has these three elements. The\r\nprojects that are now being studied and negotiated will\r\ntransform the productive structure of my country,\r\npropel the growth rates, reinforce our role as a hub and\r\nthe environmentally clean heart of the continent, while\r\nexpanding our role and presence on the Pacific.\r\nBolivia will thus take another step on the march\r\nthat it began more than 120 years ago to return to the\r\nsea of our ancestors.\r\nBolivia thus will reassert its unflinching\r\ndetermination to regain its status as a maritime nation,\r\nsomething with which we were born into independent\r\nlife.\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nBolivia supports the struggle against terrorism\r\nand for freedom. My country, more than any other\r\ncountry, is making a gigantic effort to fight the ally of\r\nterrorism — that is, drug trafficking. Given this effort,\r\ngiven our determination to be open, and given the need\r\nto fight poverty, my country calls for access to markets.\r\nBolivia will play a central role in working\r\ntowards reliable gas and energy integration in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nFinally, we realize that the long struggle for\r\nfreedom and the fight against terrorism is just\r\nbeginning and will end only when all the citizens of the\r\nworld, men and women alike, will be entitled to vote,\r\nto elect, to offer their opinions and to profess their\r\nfaith, to move about freely and, above all, to live free\r\nfrom fear and terror. The United Nations must be the\r\nplace where the world comes together to walk down\r\nthis shared path. And together we will build this road\r\ntowards integration and peace, as these times demand.\r\nAddress by Mr. Frederick Chiluba, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zambia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Frederick Chiluba, President of the Republic\r\nof Zambia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Frederick Chiluba, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Chiluba: Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election as\r\nPresident of this fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation pledges its support and\r\ncooperation to you and your country as you discharge\r\nyour important responsibilities.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\r\nPresident of the fifty-fifth session. We are grateful to\r\nhim for the able and successful manner in which he\r\npresided over the session.\r\nI wish to salute the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, on his re-election to the helm of the United\r\nNations, which is an attestation of the commitment and\r\nthe dynamism with which he has guided the\r\nOrganization during this period of great challenge.\r\nI am addressing this session in my dual capacity\r\nas President of the Republic of Zambia and current\r\nChairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).\r\nThis occasion holds a special significance to me as I\r\nmake my last statement to the General Assembly as\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, having almost\r\ncome to the end of my second and last tenure of office\r\nof my country.\r\nThis year the general debate of the General\r\nAssembly is taking place in November instead of two\r\nmonths ago, because of the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember. Those developments united us on the need\r\nto postpone this session, just as we were united in our\r\nresolve to fight international terrorism, which knows\r\nno boundaries. Indeed, today more than ever before,\r\nthe entire world seems more conscious of, and gripped\r\nby, the evil of international terrorism and the\r\nconsequent loss of life and destruction of property.\r\nTerrorism is an affront to humanity. It is a\r\nheinous and cowardly act that is hated almost as much\r\nas we hated apartheid or any form of racism. It is for\r\nthese reasons that Africa has for a long time been\r\nfighting international terrorism. In Algiers, Algeria, in\r\n1999, we, as African leaders, took a mammoth decision\r\nby adopting a Convention on the prevention and\r\ncombating of all forms of terrorism. Although the\r\nConvention has not entered into force, Africa has since\r\nthen been seeking international support in the adoption\r\nof appropriate strategies for the effective eradication of\r\nthe multiple root causes of terrorism. We remain\r\nresolute and resolutely committed to, and united in, the\r\npursuit of this goal.\r\nHowever, let me also hasten to add that, in spite\r\nof its gravity and magnitude, the threat of terrorism\r\nmust not override or deduct from the appropriate focus\r\non the outstanding matters on the global agenda.\r\nBurning issues such as the scourge of conflicts, poverty\r\neradication, the debt problem and the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, among other things, should continue to be\r\naccorded the necessary attention they so much deserve.\r\nWhile many good things and positive\r\ndevelopments have been taking place on the African\r\ncontinent, these are, nevertheless, largely\r\novershadowed by the many conflicts that continue to\r\nrage in a number of our countries. We have witnessed\r\nconflict in the Mano River basin involving Sierra\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nLeone, Liberia and Guinea; the situations in Sudan and\r\nSomalia are yet to be settled; disturbances recently\r\nerupted in the Comoros; and violence continues to\r\nthreaten the constitutionally elected Government in the\r\nCentral African Republic. The Great Lakes region\r\nremains a tinderbox, while the conflict in Angola has\r\nexperienced no movement towards resolution for quite\r\nsome time now. Meanwhile, the ceasefire agreement in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo is yet to be fully\r\nimplemented.\r\nAfrica does not lack the political will or resolve\r\nto find solutions to these conflicts. Neither has Africa\r\nsat back and waited for the outside world to come and\r\nresolve these conflicts. Instead, Africa has\r\nacknowledged responsibility for these conflicts and has\r\nspearheaded efforts to bring peace wherever there have\r\nbeen conflicts.\r\nIt was Africa, through the efforts of President\r\nAbdelaziz Bouteflika, that brought about an end to the\r\nEthiopia-Eritrea conflict. The guns were silenced in\r\nLiberia and Sierra Leone, thanks to the efforts of the\r\nleaders of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), who are still leading the effort to\r\nbring peace to the Mano River basin. The leaders of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nhave continued to seek peaceful settlements in Sudan\r\nand Somalia, while the Lusaka peace processes have\r\naddressed the conflicts in Angola and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. Most recently, a Transitional\r\nGovernment of National Unity was inaugurated in\r\nBurundi on 1 November 2001, as a culmination of\r\nefforts started by the late Mwalimu Julius Nyerere and\r\ncompleted by Nelson Mandela, two of Africa’s most\r\ndistinguished sons.\r\nIt is clear from the foregoing that what Africa\r\nneeds to successfully resolve the conflicts on the\r\ncontinent is the moral, practical and financial support\r\nof the international community. Africa has always\r\nbelieved in the dictum that in unity there is strength.\r\nWe believe that all nations belong to a common global\r\ncommunity with a shared destiny and shared\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nTo this end, Africa has always been ready and\r\nwilling to participate in efforts to restore peace where\r\npeace has broken down, irrespective of the location of\r\nthe region. Our men and women have served as\r\npeacekeepers in Europe, in Asia and in the Middle East\r\nbecause we believe that peace is indivisible.\r\nAfrica therefore expects that, just as we are ready\r\nand willing to serve in the promotion and defence of\r\npeace everywhere, so, too, should the international\r\ncommunity be willing to be full partners in the search\r\nfor peace in Africa.\r\nIn this regard, I cannot help but register our\r\ndisappointment that after the painstaking efforts by Sir\r\nKetumile Masire to organize the inter-Congolese\r\nnational dialogue in Addis Ababa on 15 October 2001,\r\nand notwithstanding the many pledges made to finance\r\nit, the dialogue could not take off due partly to\r\ninsufficient funds. I would therefore like to appeal to\r\nthe international community, through the Assembly, to\r\nprovide the necessary assistance to Sir Ketumile\r\nMasire, the facilitator of the inter-Congolese dialogue,\r\nto enable him to proceed with organizing the dialogue\r\nand to conclude the peace process in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. In particular, I wish to make a\r\nspecial appeal to all those who have made pledges to\r\nthe facilitator to release these pledges urgently.\r\nConflicts do not stand alone or develop in a\r\nvacuum. Political conflicts and social tension are a\r\nresult of imbalances in the dispensation of political\r\npower, economic wealth and benefits, as well as of\r\nsocial suppression, segregation and the repression of\r\none or more groups of people on the basis of race,\r\nethnicity or even religion. The African continent, with\r\nbarely 40 years of independence, has suffered centuries\r\nof fractured development, deprivation of resources and\r\nthe political and social suppression of its people. These\r\nare the conditions at the centre of Africa’s current\r\nstruggle to redress both the political and economic\r\nimbalances.\r\nThe United Nations World Conference against\r\nRacism, held in South Africa this year, took a major\r\nhistorical step by refocusing on that human injustice of\r\nthe past, whose consequences continue to ravage our\r\nsocieties to this day. The Conference condemned the\r\nslave trade, slavery, colonialism and apartheid as\r\ncrimes against humanity. The condemnation of past\r\ninjustices should be made on the premise that we now\r\nhave the will, the resolve and the commitment to\r\nembark upon the process of healing, reconciliation and\r\nredress. Our final objective is to bring about justice,\r\npolitical liberation, economic development and a fair\r\nsocial system that will promote the human rights of\r\nindividuals, the national sovereignty of States and\r\nmutually beneficial regional and global\r\ninterdependence and cooperation.\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nThe African economic and social condition has\r\nbeen on the agenda of the United Nations since\r\nAfrica’s decade of independence. Slavery, colonialism\r\nand apartheid, and now pervasive poverty, misery and\r\nsqualor for the majority of our people continue to\r\nravage the continent with negative consequences for\r\nhuman life. The advent of HIV/AIDS, coupled with\r\ncenturies-old diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis\r\nand with many other communicable yet curable\r\ndiseases such as cholera, dysentery and diarrhoea, has\r\nreduced African life expectancy from 68 years to 50\r\nyears, and in some countries to only a pathetic 38\r\nyears. The mortality rate for children under the age of 5\r\nyears is 140 per 1,000 births on the average. Such\r\nadverse social conditions cannot be at all conducive to\r\neconomic development and improvement in the\r\nstandard of living. These conditions have to be changed\r\nfor the better.\r\nThe development process of post-colonial or\r\nindependent Africa has also accumulated debt and\r\nsuffered negative terms of trade for its raw materials\r\nand products exported to the developed countries. On\r\nthe one hand, the resulting huge trade deficits of\r\nAfrican nations reduce their purchasing power for the\r\ntechnology, equipment and investment capital they\r\nneed for economic growth and development. On the\r\nother hand, the deficit increases the foreign debt and\r\nshrinks public investment programmes for\r\ninfrastructure and education and health delivery\r\nsystems, thereby further suppressing the very\r\nconditions necessary for development and the\r\neradication of poverty.\r\nAfrica is not asking for charity! No. What Africa\r\nis asking for is more accessible conditions for its raw\r\nmaterials and products, and for prices that are fair and\r\nconducive to development. We are not asking for\r\ncharity. No. We are asking for more African countries\r\nto have access to the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Initiative (HIPC), so that they could use the\r\nfreed resources to build infrastructure such as schools,\r\ncombat diseases, provide safe drinking water and\r\ninvest in income-generating community activities\r\nbecause, eventually, these are the measures which will\r\nreduce poverty. We further call on the international\r\ncommunity to intensify and accelerate initiatives that\r\nshould bring debt cancellation to the poor countries.\r\nThere cannot be a credible solution to the problem of\r\npoverty in Africa without debt cancellation.\r\nThe continent of Africa has accepted and fully\r\nshares the responsibilities that come with globalization.\r\nAs a developing continent, we need to continue to\r\nreorganize ourselves to face the challenges of the time.\r\nThe thirty-seventh session of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment, held in Lusaka, Zambia, last July, took\r\nAfrica to a new historical stage when it launched the\r\nAfrican Union (AU). The AU will elevate Africa’s\r\nintegration agenda by forging a more cohesive political\r\nunion, while also creating an economic community of\r\nnations. The Union also seeks to promote new levels of\r\npartnerships with the international community,\r\nparticularly in the areas of sustainable economic\r\ngrowth and development and of peace and security. At\r\nthe Lusaka Summit, the OAU also adopted a new\r\neconomic-centred recovery programme and poverty\r\nreduction strategy called the New African Initiative,\r\nwhich is now called the New Partnership for African\r\nDevelopment.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express Africa’s\r\nappreciation to the Group of 8 which, at its meeting in\r\nGenoa, Italy, in July, endorsed the African initiative. I\r\nalso wish to thank the European Union, which, during\r\nour meeting last month in Brussels, pledged its full\r\nsupport of the initiative. It is important to note also that\r\nAfrica has been an active participant in global trade\r\nliberalization initiatives. We thank the Government of\r\nthe United States for the practical step it has taken\r\nthrough the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It is\r\na pioneering example in expanding trade and export\r\nopportunities for Africa and for development.\r\nDebt relief, debt cancellation, increased\r\nproduction, accessibility to export markets, better\r\nterms of trade and economic integration — these mark\r\nthe way forward to African development, sustainable\r\ngrowth and poverty reduction. Under economic growth\r\nand improved social conditions, democracy and good\r\ngovernance will be sustained and conflicts reduced and\r\nmanaged, while peace and security will last.\r\nThe time has come for me to thank the people of\r\nZambia for having given me the privilege and honour\r\nof serving in the distinguished capacity of President of\r\nthe Republic of Zambia, to thank my colleagues in\r\nAfrica for entrusting me with the chairmanship of the\r\nOAU and for their confidence and support and to thank\r\nall of you in the international community. I have tried\r\nmy best during my tenure of office and can therefore\r\nonly hope that I have lived and performed up to your\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nexpectations. Soon Zambia will have a new president.\r\nIt is my hope that he will be accorded the same support\r\nand cooperation you have so kindly given to me in the\r\nlast ten years.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Zambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Frederick Chiluba, President of the Republic\r\nof Zambia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ion Iliescu, President of Romania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of Romania.\r\nMr. Ion Iliescu, President of Romania, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ion Iliescu, President of\r\nRomania, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Iliescu: My most sincere\r\ncongratulations go first to His Excellency Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. His outstanding\r\npersonal qualities and the consistently valuable\r\ncontributions of his country, the Republic of Korea, to\r\nUnited Nations activities are clear guarantees that the\r\nstewardship of the current session of the General\r\nAssembly, which started under dramatic and sorrowful\r\ncircumstances, has been entrusted to a safe pair of\r\nhands.\r\nI would also like to renew my heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to our Secretary-General on the well-\r\ndeserved awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize and on his\r\nelection to another term in office. Romania will\r\ncontinue to support his commendable endeavours\r\ntowards reforming the Organization in a way that\r\nshould enable it to cope effectively with the challenges,\r\nold and new, of our modern world.\r\nThe horrific terrorist attack of 11 September was\r\na rude awakening for all of us. It brought into focus\r\nboth the abyssal evil we have to confront and the high\r\nvalue of human solidarity in the international response\r\nto it. It also shed new light on some problems that the\r\ninternational community has been facing for quite a\r\nwhile and accelerated certain processes, the far-\r\nreaching consequences of which are still not easy to\r\npredict.\r\nThere can be no ambivalence or half measures\r\nwhen it comes to condemning and effectively\r\ncombating terrorism and militant, violent fanaticism of\r\nany kind. The tragedy that befell the United States and\r\nthe United Nations host city affected all humankind\r\nand created a new resolve to bring to justice the\r\nperpetrators and those who support, abet or harbour\r\nthem. We share the views of the President of the United\r\nStates, Mr. George W. Bush, that what is at stake is not\r\njust America’s freedom but that this is the world’s\r\nfight, civilization’s fight, the fight of all who believe in\r\nprogress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.\r\nBelief in those fundamental values have inspired\r\nthe noble concept of the dialogue among civilizations,\r\nso eloquently expounded by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis address to the Assembly. Indeed, it is only through\r\ndialogue that points of convergence can be identified\r\nand cooperation becomes possible on matters that\r\nacquire significance once they become the object of\r\nshared concern.\r\nMr. Borg (Malta), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nFrom the very beginning. Romania joined the\r\ninternational democratic community in its ongoing\r\ncampaign against evil-doers and their supporters for a\r\nsafer and freer world. The consensual view of the\r\nRomanian nation across the political spectrum was\r\nunequivocally expressed in Parliament’s decision to\r\nmake Romania’s air, maritime and land space available\r\nto the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization and to provide access to any other\r\nfacilities that our partners may require. This is tangible\r\nproof of our commitment to acting as a de facto\r\nmember of the North Atlantic Alliance.\r\nMy country firmly supports the relevant\r\nresolutions recently adopted by the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council, and we have already\r\nundertaken the necessary steps to ensure their full\r\nimplementation in Romania.\r\nRegional solidarity is also essential. At a very\r\nrecent conference on the common fight against\r\nterrorism, held in Warsaw on 6 November, the heads of\r\nState of Central and Eastern Europe reflected upon\r\ntheir past common experiences and voiced their\r\ndetermination to stand firmly united in the fight against\r\nterror for as long as it takes. It is also appropriate to\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nhighlight here the meaningful work done by the\r\nBucharest-based Southeast European Cooperation\r\nInitiative Regional Crime Center for Combating\r\nTransborder Crime, involving active inputs from 11\r\ncountries. The Center should build upon its current\r\nactivities in order to enhance its contribution to the\r\nworldwide fight against terrorism by making good use\r\nof existing liaison systems, intelligence-sharing and\r\njoint task forces.\r\nI fully agreed with Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nwhen he recently said that we must not let the terrorist\r\nattacks distract us from the rest of the work we have to\r\ndo. In no way do these tragic events make the broader\r\nmission of the United Nations less relevant. Indeed, the\r\nnew focus on terrorism should not divert us from the\r\ncore business of the world Organization. The agenda of\r\nthis session is both comprehensive and substantial. We\r\nshare the view that a large portion of our work should\r\nbe devoted to seeking practical ways to implement the\r\nbroad agreement reached at the Millennium Summit\r\nalong the lines indicated in the Secretary-General’s\r\nvisionary road map report.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General in his efforts to\r\nintegrate human rights into the whole range of United\r\nNations activities. We encourage closer cooperation\r\nbetween the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees, other United Nations\r\nagencies and mechanisms and regional structures that\r\nhave extensive expertise in this field, such as the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\r\nwhose chairmanship-in-office is currently held by\r\nRomania.\r\nWe regard the enhancement of the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping capability as a top priority. Recent\r\nexperience in the Balkans and elsewhere has taught us\r\nthat proper policing can be at least as important as the\r\nuse of military might in modern-day peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building operations. That is why Romania has\r\ndecided, in addition to its previous commitments in the\r\narea, to contribute a significant contingent of military\r\npolicemen to the international presence in Kosovo to\r\nassist the transition from conflict to stability.\r\nThe United Nations can become a focal point for\r\nconstructive interaction with regional or subregional\r\nstructures and specialized organizations of civil society\r\nin dealing with concrete problems ranging from\r\nconflict prevention to peace-building and post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nProbably the greatest challenge to the\r\ninternational community is still how to reduce\r\neconomic and social disparities and to achieve\r\nsustainable growth and poverty reduction within and\r\nbetween all countries through appropriate policies and\r\nwell-focused institution-building. The world’s leaders\r\nhave pledged to engage political determination,\r\nfinancial resources and innovative policies to reduce\r\nglobal poverty by half before the year 2015. This is\r\nmost commendable, but it may prove to be more\r\ndifficult to accomplish than originally envisaged.\r\nThe 11 September attacks have affected not only\r\nworld security but also the global economy, which in\r\nthe preceding months was already showing signs of a\r\nslowdown. The consequences are likely to be far-\r\nreaching and much more dangerous than those of the\r\n1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. The volume of\r\ninternational trade, which increased by almost 13 per\r\ncent in the year 2000, may decline by as much as 3 per\r\ncent in 2001. People in developing countries in\r\nparticular are going to be hurt again.\r\nThe United Nations has an essential part to play\r\nin promoting further integration of the world economy\r\nin accordance with the principles of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. But let us face the reality: we live in a\r\nworld where the developmental gap between the centre\r\nand the periphery, between North and South, between\r\nrich and poor, is still wide and growing wider. The\r\nexisting mechanisms for an orderly transfer of\r\nresources appear to have been sadly inadequate. One\r\nwould expect that the recent shock, and the renewed\r\nsense of global solidarity that it has triggered, would\r\nprompt us into action to address the underlying causes\r\nof blind anger: misery and hopelessness. The war\r\nagainst terrorism can be truly successful only if it also\r\nbecomes a war against poverty, illiteracy, disease and\r\nintolerance. I trust that the collective wisdom and\r\ngoodwill of responsible politicians everywhere will be\r\nable to produce new and effective international\r\nmechanisms meant to combine the vision of\r\nsustainable, environment-friendly development with\r\ngood governance and the generalized observance of\r\nbasic human rights.\r\nWe see disturbing signs that the increasing\r\npolarization with regard to wealth creation goes hand\r\nin hand with a deepening knowledge divide. The\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nemerging knowledge economy has scarcely heeded the\r\ninjunctions of globalization. It still appears to the eyes\r\nof many to be self-serving and parochial. However, it is\r\nprecisely the link between economic development and\r\nthe advancement of knowledge that should give the\r\nlaggards a chance to catch up through a more rational\r\nutilization of resources, including intellectual\r\nresources. We hope to see a new pattern of open\r\nnetworking which will benefit each country —\r\nespecially those that are less developed — as well as\r\nthe international system as a whole. Again, existing\r\ninstitutions do not seem creative or flexible enough to\r\naddress this challenge. The United Nations system may\r\nbecome the catalyst for concerted action in public-\r\nprivate partnerships to bring the “digital dividend” into\r\nevery community and every home.\r\nThe knowledge gap is compounded by the\r\nubiquitous phenomenon of brain drain from the\r\ndeveloping to the developed world. The problem is\r\nalmost as old as the United Nations itself. How to\r\nreverse that trend, transforming it into a “brain regain”,\r\nis another major challenge facing us all. To put it\r\nsimply, what we have here is a steady, not-so-hidden\r\nflow of subsidies from the poorer nations to the richer\r\nones. After all, most of an education budget comes out\r\nof the taxpayer’s pocket. Banish the thought of\r\nregarding the individual as the property of the all-\r\npowerful State: that notion is dead and gone. But it\r\nmay make sense to start thinking of some sort of\r\nlegally binding international instruments built on a\r\nbroader interpretation of the concept of intellectual\r\nproperty to ensure a fairer distribution of the benefits\r\nof knowledge.\r\nThe European Union has recently regulated the\r\ntransfer of players between soccer clubs. What about a\r\nsimilar contractual arrangement between, say,\r\n“Polytechnic University X Club” and “Microsoft\r\nClub”? Some experimental domestic schemes have\r\nworked well in linking industry to higher learning by\r\nresorting to market mechanisms. Why should we not\r\nconsider international intellectual partnerships,\r\nmutually beneficial for countries having advanced\r\ntechnologies and infrastructure and those generating\r\ncreative human energies?\r\nRomania supports the strengthening of the United\r\nNations through comprehensive institutional reforms\r\non the basis of the set of proposals now before us. As\r\nthe Secretary-General rightly noted, the United Nations\r\nshould turn from a culture of reaction to one of\r\nprevention, aiming at the root causes of the prevailing\r\nnegative phenomena. We look forward to an\r\nincreasingly effective General Assembly regaining its\r\ncentral position in the United Nations family, as called\r\nfor in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nExperience shows that enhanced regional\r\ncooperation can be both the engine and the result of\r\nglobalization. In a regional format, States can\r\nimplement innovative strategies for better access to\r\nresources and markets. Regional organizations are\r\npoised to become a significant factor in the global\r\ncommunity. Regional cooperation makes it possible to\r\ncapitalize on the advantages of globalization while\r\nreducing its risks.\r\nA set of policies can be successful only if it relies\r\nconsistently on the fundamental aspiration of ordinary\r\npeople to a peaceful and decent life. The current\r\nunprecedented level of knowledge will, I am confident,\r\nenable us to find the requisite resources, both in\r\nourselves and in society, for greater tolerance, mutual\r\nrespect and constructive dialogue, as opposed to the\r\nprimitive inclination to hatred and intolerance.\r\nIt is incumbent on the United Nations, the only\r\ninternational organization of universal vocation, to\r\nidentify within itself the resources for the resolution of\r\nproblems of global concern. The United Nations should\r\nkeep working tenaciously to renew its structures and\r\nimprove its operational performance as we advance\r\ninto the new millennium. Romania is ready and willing\r\nto add its contribution to that effort.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Romania for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ion Iliescu, President of Romania, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Percival James Patterson, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister of Defence of Jamaica\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister of\r\nDefence of Jamaica.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nMr. Percival James Patterson, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister of Defence of Jamaica, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence\r\nof Jamaica, The Right Honourable Percival James\r\nPatterson, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Patterson (Jamaica): I am delighted to join\r\nin the chorus of warm congratulations already\r\nexpressed before this Assembly to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, and to the United Nations itself, on the joint\r\naward of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nWe also include in this proud salute those who\r\nhave fallen in the line of duty, while recognizing those\r\nwho continue to serve in areas of danger, all for the\r\ncause of peace. It is a fitting tribute that that Prize,\r\ndedicated to the cause of peace and so richly earned by\r\nour Secretary-General in his own right and by the\r\nUnited Nations Organization collectively, has been\r\nconferred on them this year. No one doubts that the\r\naccolades are truly deserved. They are most fitting at a\r\ntime when the entire world is in upheaval.\r\nThe catastrophic attacks, cynically perpetrated on\r\nthe International Day of Peace in the city that is host to\r\nthe United Nations, as well as elsewhere, have, in their\r\nwanton slaughter of innocents and awesome\r\ndestructiveness, sent shock waves around the world.\r\nThe messiahs of terror have, by the sheer magnitude\r\nand horror of their unprecedented crime against\r\nhumanity, unified nations and people in the\r\ndetermination to remove the spectre of terrorism in all\r\nits many forms, wherever it is manifested.\r\nJamaica stands firmly with the international\r\ncommunity on Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nagainst terrorism. As a member of the Council, we\r\nassert, with particular emphasis and deliberation, our\r\nunwavering commitment to the cause of ending this\r\npernicious evil.\r\nTo defeat the forces of terror, our collective\r\naction must be firm, decisive and broad-based.\r\nInternational law must become a binding framework\r\nfor the total defeat of terrorism. Jamaica welcomes the\r\nongoing efforts to elaborate a draft comprehensive\r\nconvention against terrorism. We hope that during this\r\nsession of the General Assembly the momentum will\r\nbe seized to achieve measurable progress in this critical\r\narea. At the same time, the international community\r\nneeds to take action aimed at achieving the universality\r\nof the existing conventions and other instruments\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nJamaica is accelerating its domestic action to\r\nachieve those objectives, and this morning I was\r\npleased to sign the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\r\nFor the past two years, Jamaica has worked with\r\nother members of the Council to make peacekeeping\r\noperations more efficient; to create strategies for\r\nsustained peace-building; to bring warring factions to\r\nthe peace table and, beyond that, to promote\r\ncompliance with resulting accords; and to put in place\r\nmechanisms for protecting those most affected by\r\nsituations of conflict, especially the women and\r\nchildren.\r\nWe are pleased with the work already undertaken\r\nin respect of the Brahimi report on peacekeeping\r\noperations. Through a number of tribunals, we have\r\ndemonstrated that the United Nations will act to end\r\nimpunity. Despite sustained international efforts,\r\nhowever, several flashpoints still remain.\r\nJamaica is deeply concerned about the continuing\r\ncycle of violence and reprisal in the Middle East.\r\nEfforts to achieve a durable ceasefire have been\r\nthwarted at every turn. Numerous resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council have been ignored. We recognize the\r\npositive efforts of some permanent members to\r\ninfluence a return to the peace process, but the Security\r\nCouncil should not be marginalized in these initiatives.\r\nJamaica again urges the Government of Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority to spare no effort in complying\r\nwith agreements already reached. We call on both\r\nparties to remain engaged in the quest for a durable\r\npeace.\r\nWe dare not neglect the millions of children\r\nworldwide who suffer from hunger, disease and\r\nignorance. In situations of conflict, children are the\r\nmost vulnerable victims. We have all been horrified by\r\ntheir exploitation as child soldiers and by the\r\ntrafficking and sexual abuse that numerous children\r\nhave suffered. We have to remember that they\r\nconstitute the generation of tomorrow, in whose hands\r\nwill rest the future of international peace and security.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nNor must we forget the importance of\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the innocent people in\r\nconflict-torn areas of the world and to refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, as well as to those who are victims\r\nof natural and man-made disasters. For them, the\r\nUnited Nations must become a beacon of hope for the\r\npeace and stability that will enable them to lead normal\r\nand productive lives.\r\nMilitary strikes cannot by themselves eradicate\r\nterrorism. In our response, we need to be mindful that\r\nthe time has come for us to inaugurate a new era of\r\npeace — not simply through preventing war, but by\r\neliminating the causes that give rise to strife and\r\nviolence. And so I stand at this rostrum today to call\r\nfor a United Nations renaissance, for a rebirth of this\r\nOrganization, which will not just permit it to be the\r\nharbinger of peace, but which will empower it to foster\r\na climate that will usher in a new age of global\r\ndevelopment and a dynamic partnership for human\r\nprosperity.\r\nWe are living in a time of fear, not just in this\r\ncountry or here in this city, but worldwide: fear for the\r\nlives of people; fear for the state of economies,\r\nnational and global; fear that our propensity for wanton\r\ndestruction may impair the capacity of the planet itself\r\nto sustain life. These fears are compounded by other\r\nblights — the blights of disease, ignorance and bigotry\r\ntowards people on the basis of ethnicity, religion and\r\ngender; the blight of cruel and autocratic governance in\r\nsome places; and, most pervasive of all, the blight of\r\npoverty.\r\nThe expansion of the global economy in the last\r\nfour decades has not eliminated gross poverty or even\r\nreduced its prevalence. A sophisticated, globalized,\r\nincreasingly affluent world currently co-exists, globally\r\nand within countries, with a marginalized underclass.\r\nThe hungry, the homeless and the destitute are\r\nless impassioned about the physical insecurities of\r\nterrorist repression or the damaging consequences of\r\nmilitary warfare. The unemployed, those who are ill\r\nbut have no health care, those who are cold but have no\r\nproper heating, those who are old but have no social\r\nsupport — for these victims, “security” means a meal,\r\na roof, a job, medicine, warmth and relief from poverty\r\nin general. But those needs are just as real and\r\ninsistent, and they represent for them the most\r\nimmediate denial of their rights as human beings.\r\nDuring the last decade, the process of\r\nglobalization, deregulation and privatization has swept\r\nthe world. It is incontrovertible that it has not been a\r\ngolden age for a large proportion of the world’s people:\r\nnot just for the 1.3 billion absolute poor in developing\r\ncountries whom the benefits of globalization seem to\r\nhave bypassed, but for many millions in industrial\r\ncountries also. We delude ourselves if we believe that\r\nall those engaged in street protests, whether in Seattle,\r\nWashington, Prague, Quebec city or Rome, are simply\r\nanarchists.\r\nInternational institutions must not only be\r\naccountable; they must be subject to democratic\r\ngovernance as well. It is becoming more widely\r\nrecognized that a new global institutional architecture\r\nis needed to establish representative superintendence of\r\nthe global economy, directed towards enlargement of\r\nsocial and economic justice worldwide and targeted to\r\na sharp redirection of the numbers mired in gross\r\npoverty and deprivation.\r\nSome of the desired progress may be possible\r\nthrough existing institutions, but more radical reform\r\nmay also be required. Democratic superintendence of\r\nthe global economy has to be a central feature of the\r\nfresh global architecture we seek to fashion during this\r\ndecade. That new global architecture must incorporate\r\nappropriate arrangements for a start to be made in\r\nraising global resources for global purposes in ways\r\nthat do not generate alarm. The persistence of gross\r\npoverty, the long list of environmental abuses, the\r\ndisturbing reduction in development aid and the\r\nvagaries of foreign private investment make a\r\ncompelling case for global revenues.\r\nThe world faces crucial choices. We have to\r\nidentify and follow a guiding principle if humanity is\r\nto make an enlightened response to the challenges we\r\nface. We can hardly return to the principles of a feudal\r\nworld in which military and economic strength are\r\nconcentrated in the hands of a few, while we indulge in\r\nan illusion of order through the marginalization of the\r\nmany. In our interdependent, interconnected world, that\r\nis no longer a credible option.\r\nOur only way forward lies here in the United\r\nNations. If this institution did not exist before 11\r\nSeptember, we would have to create it now. We have to\r\nbe inspired by the vision that propelled the generation\r\nof 1945 to pursue the path of collective responsibility\r\nfor peace and human progress through a regime of\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nmultilateral action anchored by the United Nations. It\r\nwas coterie of Governments, in a rare moment of\r\ncollective wisdom and creativity, that settled the United\r\nNations Charter. It was not without flaws in its\r\ninception, and some flaws have remained to hobble its\r\ncapacity to initiate the renaissance of which I speak.\r\nIt is within that context that the demand for the\r\nreform of the Security Council becomes even more\r\nurgent, since the Council’s present design and\r\nfunctioning weaken its capacity to fulfil its mandate.\r\nWe must remove all existing constraints on the capacity\r\nof the United Nations. Even as we work to improve it\r\nand to reform it, we must proclaim the United Nations\r\nto be the temple in which we can all worship. “We, the\r\npeople” must be made a reality to fulfil the\r\ncommitment made in their name by the Charter of\r\n1945.\r\nToday, our greatest hope lies in people: in people\r\nof all races, of all genders, of all faiths; people of all\r\ncontinents and oceans; people of all ages; the\r\n“ordinary” people of the world and those who hold\r\nthemselves to be of higher station. All the world’s\r\npeople are affected by the calamities that loom; all\r\nmust be involved in turning humanity away from\r\ngloom and in finding the light.\r\nThe Charter does not set out the principal organs\r\nof the United Nations in a hierarchical order, but the\r\nGeneral Assembly is the only principal organ under the\r\nCharter that embraces all the Members on a one\r\nmember, one vote basis. It is the symbol of the United\r\nNations as a universal organization in the best\r\ndemocratic tradition. And so, I believe that it is within\r\nthe General Assembly that the true renaissance of the\r\nUnited Nations must begin. The special value of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is its universality, its capacity to be\r\na forum in which the voice of every Member State can\r\nbe raised. It provides the opportunity for countries to\r\nventilate issues, to bring complaints to the floor in the\r\ngeneral debate and to suggest new ideas in committees.\r\nBut the assumption surely must be valid that\r\ndeliberation should inform action.\r\nHigh among the changes that should mark the\r\nrenaissance of the United Nations is the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly as a universal forum of the\r\nworld’s States. Even with a reformed and somewhat\r\nenlarged Security Council, many Member States with a\r\ncapacity to contribute significantly to the policies and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations and to global\r\ngovernance will have to remain on the sidelines. A\r\nGeneral Assembly that occupies more of the stage and\r\nreorders its work to make it more focused and more\r\nresult-oriented, will allow each of us a meaningful role\r\nin world governance through our work in the\r\nAssembly. It is in the interest of the world community\r\nto have a more vigorous and effective General\r\nAssembly which can and should play a vital\r\nlegitimating role in the United Nations, consonant with\r\nthe universality of its membership.\r\nHere in the General Assembly, we are the\r\npractitioners of international affairs. At the heart of the\r\nconduct of those affairs must lie a sense of realism. I\r\ntoo am conscious that the accumulated baggage of\r\ndecades cannot be shed in a single heave. That is why I\r\ndo not call for reform but advocate instead a\r\nrenaissance: a rebirth which offers the chance of facing\r\nthe twenty-first century with sound values no longer\r\npredicated on a world of adversarial States but on an\r\ninteractive world of people that has espoused\r\nneighbourhood values of respect for life and liberty, for\r\njustice and equity, for tolerance and caring; values that\r\nbalance rights with responsibilities, that elevate the\r\ndemocratic ethic at both the national and the global\r\nlevels.\r\nWe are a long way from that consummation,\r\nhowever devoutly we may wish it. But we are\r\nsufficiently frightened by the prospects that confront us\r\nto recognize the need for humanity to take “the path\r\nless travelled by”. There are enough good people in all\r\nour societies — who together are the silent majority of\r\nthe world’s people — to ensure that by choosing this\r\nnew path we can indeed make a real difference. We\r\nhave to find a better way than the one a divided world\r\nhas been pursuing. That way has to lie through the\r\nUnited Nations as an organization — but a United\r\nNations revitalized, its agencies repaired, reformed and\r\nresponsive to a culture of new values appropriate to our\r\ntime.\r\nThis new era of global relations demands bolder\r\nand more ingenious approaches to confidence-building\r\nand to development as a prerequisite for international\r\npeace and security. An equitable framework to finance\r\nnational and global development, to fuel expansion of\r\ninternational trade and to foster sustainable\r\ndevelopment must be placed on the front burner,\r\nwhether we gather in Qatar, in Mexico or in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nIf the global conferences to be held in those three\r\nplaces are to succeed, Member States must be guided\r\nby full recognition that this new era of global relations\r\ndemands, as I said, more ingenious approaches to\r\nconfidence-building and to development as a\r\nprecondition for international peace and security.\r\nIn closing, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his assumption of the\r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly and\r\nto commit Jamaica’s total support for the attainment of\r\nour common goals in the service of all humankind.\r\nWhatever may be our colour, culture or creed, we\r\nbelong to a single race — that is, the human race. We\r\noccupy a single planet, which has more than enough to\r\nenable each person and every nation to enjoy the\r\nabundance which Mother Earth has to offer and for all\r\nits people to dwell together in harmony.\r\nNow more than at any time in its history, the\r\nUnited Nations is the best vehicle to procure global\r\npeace and to foster international cooperation. Let this,\r\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, loudly\r\nand clearly proclaim that the renaissance of the United\r\nNations has indeed begun.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Defence of Jamaica for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nThe Right Honourable Percival James Patterson,\r\nMP, Prime Minister and Minister for Defence of\r\nJamaica, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alhaji Aliu Mahama, Vice-President\r\nof the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear a statement by Mr. Alhaji Aliu Mahama, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. Alhaji Aliu Mahama, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Alhaji Aliu Mahama,\r\nVice-President of the Republic of Ghana, and I invite\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mahama (Ghana): Mr. Han’s election to the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly is a tribute\r\nto his vast experience and accomplished diplomatic\r\nskills. It is also an honour to his country, the Republic\r\nof Korea, with which my country enjoys the most\r\ncordial and friendly relations. I ask him to please\r\naccept our congratulations.\r\nMay I also express our gratitude and appreciation\r\nto his immediate predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of\r\nFinland, for the able manner in which he guided the\r\nwork of the fifty-fifth session.\r\nI wish to express the heartfelt gratitude of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Ghana to the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations for having placed their\r\ntrust and the destiny of this universal Organization\r\nonce again in the hands of an illustrious son of Ghana\r\nand of Africa, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the next five years.\r\nThe Nobel Peace Prize, awarded jointly to the\r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations, is in\r\nrecognition of their devotion to the pursuit of global\r\npeace and security. On this occasion, I can only\r\nendorse the sentiments expressed by Mr. Annan that\r\nthe award should serve as an impetus to record greater\r\nachievements in the service of humanity.\r\nThe last century witnessed laudable achievements\r\nin the political, economic, scientific and technological\r\nspheres. Despite these positive developments, history,\r\nin the end, will remember it for the numerous conflicts\r\nthat marked it, with their attendant socio-economic\r\ndisruptions, environmental degradation, the emergence\r\nof hitherto-unknown diseases and the persistence of\r\npoverty among the majority of our people.\r\nThe tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001\r\nawakened the world to the new challenges confronting\r\ninternational peace and security. The fight against\r\nterrorism must be a collective action, guided by the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nand of international law. Ghana welcomes the\r\ninternational community’s response in confronting this\r\nthreat to peace and security. We also applaud the swift\r\nresponse of the Security Council and of the General\r\nAssembly, which not only condemned the attacks, but\r\nalso took measures aimed at confronting terrorism.\r\nResolution 1373 (2001), which outlines the measures\r\nthat all countries — irrespective of size, wealth or\r\nmight — should adopt to forestall and combat terrorism\r\nmust be pursued by all peace-loving nations.\r\nAs we forge ahead, our quest to free the world of\r\nterrorism will be enhanced if we adequately address\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nboth the symptoms and the underlying causes that give\r\nrise to such criminal acts. Developing countries should\r\nbe provided with the necessary resources to play a\r\nmeaningful role in confronting these challenges.\r\nThe recent threats and crimes against humanity\r\nhave reinforced our belief in the need for the early\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, in\r\norder to enable the global community to deal\r\nappropriately with such phenomena. We therefore urge\r\nall Member States that have not yet ratified the Statute\r\nto do so to enable it to enter into force.\r\nThe proliferation of conventional weapons,\r\nnotably small arms and light weapons, has been of\r\ngreat concern to the Government and the people of\r\nGhana. They are now the weapons of choice and the\r\ntools for promoting violence and conflicts in Africa.\r\nSuch weapons have always been used against the most\r\nvulnerable in society, especially women and children.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Programme of Action\r\nadopted at the recent United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects. While it does not respond to all of our\r\nconcerns or meet all of our expectations, we still\r\nconsider it to be the beginning of a process that will\r\nlead to an internationally binding instrument on\r\nmanaging and controlling such weapons.\r\nConflicts, particularly in the developing world,\r\nhave robbed us of the opportunity to improve the\r\ncircumstances of our people. Sustainable development\r\ncan be achieved only in an environment of peace and\r\nsecurity. Ghana will continue to live up to its Charter\r\nobligations and to play an active role in international\r\npeacekeeping, with a view to assisting the United\r\nNations in its task of maintaining global peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nOnly a year ago, world leaders, at the Millennium\r\nSummit, committed themselves to providing leadership\r\nto create a better world, one which would uphold\r\nhuman dignity, equality and equity at the global level,\r\nthrough the elimination of poverty and the creation of a\r\nconducive environment for development.\r\nTo achieve this, it is imperative that the\r\ninternational community take steps to assist countries\r\nthat have created the necessary environment for sound\r\neconomic development. This will enable them to reach\r\ntheir potential for sustained growth through conducive\r\npolicies concerning debt, market access, transfer of\r\ntechnology, increased flows of capital and foreign\r\ndirect investment, and enhanced official development\r\nassistance.\r\nIt is important, particularly at this moment when\r\nthe fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization is taking place in Doha, to emphasize the\r\ncritical role of global trade in generating the resources\r\nfor financing development in developing countries. The\r\noutcome of the Doha Conference, our commitment to\r\npursuing the decisions and processes emanating from\r\nthat Conference, the implementation of the\r\ncommitments made in the Uruguay Round and how we\r\naddress intellectual property rights should clearly\r\ndetermine our commitment to eradicating poverty\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWe believe that the success of our efforts at the\r\nglobal level will depend largely on the quality of\r\ngovernance in our respective countries. We cannot\r\nclaim to uphold the dignity of every human being or\r\nmake claims to social equity if we fail to uphold\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, combat corruption and\r\nstrengthen the institutions of governance. It is therefore\r\ngratifying to note that in the past few years democracy\r\nhas begun to take root in Africa. This trend should be\r\nencouraged and consolidated with support from the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIt is for this reason that Ghana fully endorsed the\r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union, which, among\r\nother things, rejects unconstitutional changes of\r\nGovernment and reaffirms respect for democratic\r\nprinciples, human rights, the rule of law and good\r\ngovernance. The decisions we took in Lusaka during\r\nthe last summit of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) on the African Union and the New Partnership\r\nfor African Development have reasserted Africa’s\r\nleadership and responsibility for the continent’s\r\ndevelopment agenda. Ghana intends to play its part\r\nthrough positive diplomacy and cooperation with other\r\nAfrican countries to accelerate regional integration and\r\nmake Africa a zone of economic empowerment.\r\nAfrica accepts its primary responsibility for its\r\nown development. However, the contribution of its\r\ndevelopment partners will continue to be crucial. In\r\nthis connection, the outcomes of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nnext year in Monterrey, Mexico, and of the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\r\nJohannesburg, will be critical tests of our willingness\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nto tackle concretely the challenges we set for ourselves\r\nin the Millennium Declaration.\r\nAt the onset of the new millennium, we hope that\r\ngender issues will continue to engage the attention of\r\nthe international community. The adoption of the\r\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action, in 1995,\r\nand the subsequent adoption of further actions and\r\ninitiatives by the twenty-third special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, last year, indicate the universal\r\nrecognition of the need to empower women as partners\r\nin socio-economic development. As a result of the\r\ngreat importance that Ghana attaches to the\r\nadvancement of women, our Government has elevated\r\nthe national machinery for the advancement of women\r\ninto a full-fledged ministry headed by a cabinet\r\nminister. We are determined, through practical\r\nmeasures, to make our women full and effective\r\npartners in the development of our country.\r\nGhana welcomes the remarkable success achieved\r\nby the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session with\r\nthe adoption, after protracted negotiations, of the\r\nresolutions on the scale of assessments for the regular\r\nand peacekeeping budgets. It is therefore our\r\nconsidered view that both resolutions should ensure the\r\nfinancial solvency and viability of the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reassure the Assembly of\r\nGhana’s abiding commitment to the United Nations and\r\nits ideals. The Organization is the best means available\r\nfor maintaining international peace and security and\r\npromoting fruitful international cooperation. We must\r\nall resolve to strengthen our will to make it more\r\neffective and to redeem the majority of our people from\r\nwars, disease and poverty by providing it with financial\r\nand material resources commensurate with its\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hubert Védrine, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of France.\r\nMr. Védrine (France) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, it is a great pleasure for me to congratulate the\r\nPresident on his election, which is a sign of the esteem\r\nin which he and his country are held.\r\nComing after his re-election to a second term ─\r\nwhich is a sign of the general confidence he has\r\nearned ─ the Nobel Peace Prize that has been awarded\r\nto the Secretary-General is a well-deserved tribute to\r\nhis work and, through him, to the United Nations\r\nOrganization as a whole, thereby inspiring greater hope\r\nthan ever before.\r\nOn this my third visit to New York since the\r\ntragedy of 11 September, I also want to express once\r\nagain my profound emotion and pay homage to the\r\npeople of New York, who are being so severely tested,\r\nand to their courageous mayor, who is now finishing\r\nhis term.\r\nThe unprecedented magnitude and gravity of the\r\nterrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11\r\nSeptember warrant our unfailing solidarity and an\r\nexceptional response. In its resolution 1368 (2001),\r\nwhich was adopted unanimously, the Security Council\r\nrightly qualified those acts as attacks and, hence, as\r\nlegitimately meriting a defensive response under\r\nArticle 51 of the Charter. The United States is thus\r\nentirely within its legal and political rights in carrying\r\nout its targeted military response against the terrorist\r\norganizations responsible for those acts. The military\r\naction under way was therefore inevitable, and must be\r\npursued until all its objectives have been achieved.\r\nGiven the preliminary results achieved yesterday, I\r\nhope that those objectives will be met as soon as\r\npossible. The leaders of these terrorist networks and\r\nthose who support them must be decisively prevented\r\nfrom committing further harm.\r\nBut that military action should, as a matter of\r\ncourse, form part of an overarching strategy that\r\nincludes immediate, broad-scale humanitarian action\r\nthat is better adapted to the needs of people in distress.\r\nFrance has put forward several proposals in this regard\r\nand supports the current initiatives for better\r\ncoordination. That overarching strategy should also\r\ninclude a political solution — something that has now\r\nbecome urgent — and strive to ensure that the demise\r\nof the Taliban regime does not lead to factional\r\ninfighting and chaos; and it must once again make the\r\nAfghan people masters of their own future. That is the\r\naim of the action plan for Afghanistan that France\r\nproposed back on 1 October, and of the other\r\ncontributions it has made with the same goals in mind.\r\nWe await Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi’s proposals with\r\ninterest; they should set forth broad outlines of action\r\nfor the United Nations. On these bases, the Security\r\nCouncil should be able to adopt a framework resolution\r\nwithin a few days, endorsing Mr. Brahimi’s proposals\r\nand spelling out the modalities of United Nations\r\nsupport for the establishment of an Afghan\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nGovernment representative of the various constituents\r\nof the population. There is no question of imposing on\r\nAfghanistan some ready-made solution concocted by\r\noutsiders. I call on all the constituents of the Afghan\r\nnation and all neighbouring countries to heed the\r\ngeneral interest of Afghanistan and its people. This is\r\ncompatible with respect for the legitimate interests of\r\nthe various parties concerned and it is the only way to\r\nturn our backs on the past.\r\nBeyond immediate military, diplomatic and\r\nhumanitarian action, our common fight against\r\nterrorism needs to be pursued in all its forms, including\r\npolice, judicial and others. The United Nations will\r\nhave a crucial role to play in this difficult struggle,\r\nlaying down universal obligations for each State and\r\nthe framework for our action. A series of conventions\r\nhas already been concluded, particularly the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, which I proposed in this very\r\nplace in 1999. We must speed up the signature and\r\nratification of those conventions. The General\r\nAssembly must quickly conclude the negotiations on\r\nthe comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism. For its part, the Security Council should\r\noversee the coordinated implementation by States of its\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nAction against terrorism also needs to be carried\r\nout through other organizations, in conjunction with\r\nthe United Nations and consistent with its policies. For\r\nits part, the European Union (EU) has just taken\r\nunprecedented steps to strengthen police and judicial\r\ncooperation among its member States, including the\r\ncreation of a European arrest warrant. An ambitious\r\naction plan has been agreed. The 29 members of the\r\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) have decided to\r\nextend the fight against money-laundering to the fight\r\nagainst the financing of terrorism. Beyond that, I\r\npropose the creation of a dialogue forum to move us in\r\nthis direction. Several other organizations, too, will\r\nhave a role to play, so that at the end of the day every\r\ncountry will be making a contribution.\r\nLeaving aside the hoped-for short-term results,\r\nthe obstacles notwithstanding, we will not achieve\r\nlasting victory against all forms of terrorism unless we\r\nsucceed in depriving terrorists of their breeding ground\r\nand eliminating the pretexts from which they\r\nfallaciously draw their justification, and unless we\r\neradicate them in the true sense of the term. That\r\nimplies nothing short of changing our world. And let\r\nno one claim that this would be tantamount to\r\njustifying the terrorists. For neither my country, nor\r\nEurope, nor the United Nations — in other words, none\r\nof us — waited for 11 September to discover, condemn\r\nand seek to remedy the ills of the world. Yet how many\r\ngood intentions have come to naught? How many\r\nresolutions have gone unimplemented? How many\r\nannouncements have failed to materialize, which now\r\nfeed a sense of bitterness and incomprehension? It is\r\npointless to condemn or deny the theory of a clash of\r\ncivilizations. Rather, we must fight against such a risk,\r\nwhich is by no means wholly imaginary, and against\r\nthose who would make it a reality.\r\nThis should be one more pressing reason for us\r\nall to find a solution to regional crises, particularly in\r\nthe Middle East. Since 1982, France has called for the\r\ncreation of a Palestinian State. Naturally, it would have\r\nto be viable, democratic and peaceful, and it should\r\ngive credible undertakings as regards Israel’s security.\r\nGuarantees will be needed, yet the Palestinian State is\r\nnot the problem; it is the solution for reasons based on\r\nrights, humanity and security. Such is the EU’s\r\ncommon stance today. This morning, before the\r\nAssembly, President Bush himself has made this his\r\nobjective. It is the path of reason — the only path that\r\ncan halt the murderous spiral of conflict between the\r\ntwo peoples.\r\nAdmittedly, responsibility for a lasting peace\r\nagreement lies first and foremost with the protagonists.\r\nUnless they make the move, no one else will be able to\r\novercome their fears and resentment and put an end to\r\nthe suffering of these two peoples. Yet, the increasing\r\nthreat that this conflict poses to international peace and\r\nsecurity requires that those who have the will and the\r\nmeans join forces in a push for peace, given that the\r\nmain players are evidently unable to do so unaided.\r\nThe urgency of the situation in the Near East\r\nobviously should not make us forget Iraq. Regional\r\nsecurity still needs to be secured by restoring an\r\ninternational monitoring capability and by alleviating\r\nthe suffering of the Iraqi people through the lifting of\r\nthe embargo on civilian goods. I hope the discussions\r\nnow in progress in the Security Council will finally\r\nbring this about.\r\nNor should we forget the Caucasus, where ancient\r\nquarrels live on and where new ones are rising to the\r\nfore. Yet, here again there is no other way than to seek\r\nnegotiated political solutions.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nIn the Balkans, we realized that international\r\ninvolvement must be sustainable. Thanks to it, and\r\nthanks to new leaders, noteworthy progress has been\r\nachieved towards democracy, reconciliation and\r\nregional cooperation over the last two years. We must\r\nmake sure these positive changes are not challenged by\r\noutmoded patterns of behaviour. We must maintain and\r\npursue the Europeanization of the Balkans.\r\nTurning to the Great Lakes region, we know that\r\nthe lasting resolution of the conflict, which involves\r\nmore than eight countries, will be a negotiated solution\r\nthat will ensure the restoration of the sovereignty of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and include as well\r\nsafeguard clauses to protect the security of each of the\r\nStates. The Lusaka Agreement and the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions provide the framework for\r\nending this crisis, but they should be applied as quickly\r\nas possible. To halt the illegal use of the resources of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which often\r\noccurs in association with forced child labour, should\r\nbe an immediate priority.\r\nIn all the cases I have just referred to briefly —\r\nand there are others — the problem we have to resolve\r\nis the coexistence of peoples who are at once close and\r\nantagonistic, deeply affected and divided by history\r\nand separated by fear and the spirit of revenge. We will\r\nachieve this only through perseverance and a clear\r\nunderstanding of each particular situation, guided by\r\nthe principles of the United Nations.\r\nEven if we managed to resolve all these regional\r\ncrises and others as well, our task would still not be\r\nover because, at the global level, the gulf between\r\nintentions for the world as stated at international\r\nmeetings and actual realities is becoming intolerable\r\nfor many peoples. We must redouble our efforts to\r\ncreate humane globalization. We saw this in Seattle, we\r\nsaw it in Genoa, and even more so in Durban. We can\r\nsee it in the reactions to the Afghan crisis and to many\r\nother issues. Despite the United Nations and our good\r\nresolutions, there is still no real universal consensus.\r\nWhat we call “the international community” has yet to\r\nbe built. Is this a reason to throw in the towel? To the\r\ncontrary – absolutely not. France has long been\r\ndetermined to add its stone to this edifice. We have\r\nalready put forward numerous proposals to that end and\r\nwill continue to do so, with increased conviction.\r\nNeed I recall our well-known major objectives for\r\nthe world?\r\nFirst, we must achieve a fairer distribution of\r\nwealth; 3 billion people currently live on less than 2\r\ndollars per day, and the global income gap between the\r\nrichest and the poorest has doubled over the last 40\r\nyears.\r\nSecond, we must end impunity.\r\nThird, we must guarantee sustainable\r\ndevelopment everywhere — “sustainable”, that little\r\nword that makes all the difference, or which should\r\nmake all the difference. The World Summit in\r\nJohannesburg in September 2002 will provide an\r\nopportunity to affirm a vision and a benchmark of\r\ndevelopment based on three intimately linked pillars:\r\neconomic, social and environmental.\r\nFourth, we must help refugees and fully respect\r\nthe right of asylum.\r\nFifth, we must manage population movements in\r\na humanitarian manner.\r\nSixth, we must draft international standards in a\r\ndemocratic way to ensure that they are entirely\r\nlegitimate and that everyone will consequently be\r\nbound to comply with them.\r\nSeventh, we must no longer tolerate situations of\r\nhuman distress. State sovereignty, which remains an\r\nessential feature of the international system, cannot, in\r\nextreme emergencies, be regarded as an absolute\r\nprinciple serving as a pretext for inaction. The Security\r\nCouncil must be able to fully assume its\r\nresponsibilities in cases of gross human rights\r\nviolations, for these also pose threats to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nEighth, we must aim at promoting balanced and\r\nnegotiated disarmament, which strengthens security\r\nand strategic stability.\r\nNinth, we must strive to allow all languages,\r\ncultures and civilizations to exist while maintaining a\r\ndialogue with one another.\r\nTenth, we must seek to improve the state of\r\nhealth worldwide, which for one thing means devoting\r\nmore resources to combating HIV/AIDS. I would hope\r\nthat the new Global AIDS and Health Fund will be\r\nmade operational by the beginning of 2002.\r\nBut we are undoubtedly now more aware than in\r\nrecent years that the attainment of these objectives,\r\nwhich are both indispensable, and very ambitious, calls\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\ndifferent rules and different mechanisms, starting with\r\nthe reform and enlargement of the Security Council,\r\nwhich we have waited for all too long; with respect for\r\nthe role of the General Assembly; with the ratification\r\nof the major multilateral instruments — I am thinking\r\nof the Statute of the International Criminal Court and\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol, among others; with a more\r\nappropriate and less indiscriminate use of sanctions\r\nwhen they are needed; with a clarification of the\r\nrespective and legitimate roles of Governments and\r\ncivil society; with an agreement on the modalities of\r\ninterference to deal with large-scale and extreme\r\nemergency situations; with a regulation and\r\ndevelopment round at the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO), which is starting today in Doha; with closer\r\ncooperation and greater consistency between the WTO\r\nand the International Labour Organization; with the\r\ncreation of a world environmental organization; and\r\nwith reform of the international financial institutions. I\r\nshall stop this list here. I could go on, for there is so\r\nmuch that remains to be done.\r\nAll of us, as Members of the United Nations, are\r\nfaced with this challenge. But I do not hesitate to say\r\nhere that the rich countries — in other words, the West\r\nand a handful of other countries from the Organization\r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, where\r\nsome 1.135 billion men and women live, have even\r\nmore responsibility than others. Now that the illusions\r\nof the last 10 years have been dispelled, the choice\r\nbefore us is harsh, but clear: either a world so unjust\r\nthat we have conflict with no foreseeable end, or, on\r\nthe contrary, an international community of the United\r\nNations, at last worthy of the name, to solve together\r\nhumanity’s common problems and ensure its future.\r\nBut building this community, instead of just talking\r\nabout it or yearning for it, will mean for some of us\r\ngiving up privileges, sharing wealth and power in new\r\nways, and rewriting certain rules hitherto held to be\r\ninviolable. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist\r\nJoseph Stiglitz has written, free trade was designed by\r\nWestern countries for the Western countries. This is\r\ndebatable, of course, but none of this will happen\r\nwithout sacrifices, above all on the part of the rich and\r\npowerful countries.\r\nAt this very moment, a reshuffling of diplomatic\r\ncards on a grand scale is under way between the United\r\nStates, Russia, China, Europe, the Arab or Muslim\r\nworld, the other coalition partners, the rest of the world\r\nand the United Nations. I hope — I truly hope — that\r\nthis will help to bring about a vital awakening and that\r\nmy country, Europe and the United Nations will follow\r\nnew avenues, in deeds and not just words, and that all\r\nof us, together, will successfully extend the needed\r\ncoalition against terrorism to turn it into a coalition for\r\nan equitable world, and that this will lay the\r\ngroundwork for a renewal of the international system.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Juli Minoves-Triquell, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Andorra.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Allow me at the outset to congratulate Mr.\r\nHan Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of the\r\nAssembly and to express our thanks to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nI would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, and the United Nations on their\r\nwell-deserved Nobel Peace Prize.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe are compelled to take up the events of 11\r\nSeptember and the actions initiated by our\r\nOrganization, starting with Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), at our discussions here today. I have\r\nchosen to make my statement in a language not of my\r\ncountry — English, the language of our host country\r\nand city — in tribute to the United States, to the\r\nAmerican people and Government and to New York\r\nCity, which were harmed by the recent terrorist attacks.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe meet today almost two months after the\r\nterrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York\r\nCity. The horror of this attack, the thousands dead: so\r\nmany terrible images have been seared into our\r\ncollective memory. And we remember also the\r\nremarkable acts of courage and determination that\r\nfollowed in the wake of this shameful crime.\r\nThat the attack took place here, in New York, the\r\nseat of the United Nations, is both painful and sad. For\r\nNew York is an immigrant’s city that welcomes with\r\nopen arms all races and all creeds from our world. The\r\nlist of the victims of the attack, from so many different\r\ncountries, attests to the remarkable and joyous\r\ndiversity that makes New York. She is truly the capital\r\nof the world, and the right place, the only place, for its\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nWe know that this very building might have been\r\na target for the terrorists, and that in an earlier terrorist\r\nattack of 1993, the United Nations was on the list. This\r\nseems to me proof, if any is needed, that the United\r\nStates of America is not the only object of terrorism.\r\nRather, it is the idea of tolerance and religious and\r\ncultural diversity, symbolized both by New York City\r\nand by the United Nations, that is the object of the rage\r\nof a small group of men — men who live and die by\r\nterror and who have turned away from political debate\r\nto violence and death.\r\nAnd so all of us here must play our part in the\r\nbattle against mindless killing, and debate both the\r\nreasons for and the responses to terrorism. If there are\r\ndisagreements and disputes, we should never forget\r\nthat the very act of debate — the very idea of this\r\nforum — is anathema to those whose modus operandi\r\nis silence. What is telling, in my opinion, is not the\r\nidentity of the perpetrator — we are quite certain who\r\nis responsible, although we have only begun to\r\nconsider why — but the fact that the perpetrators, dead\r\nand alive, never admitted responsibility for their\r\nactions.\r\nI would thus like to express the views of my\r\ncountry, the Principality of Andorra, in this debate.\r\nAndorra is a small country created in 1278 by a pact of\r\npeace, and is blessed with seven centuries of peace and\r\na parliamentary system that started in 1419. We\r\nAndorrans like to think of our country as an example of\r\ntolerance and coexistence of different creeds and\r\nnationalities. Through the centuries, we have welcomed\r\nscores of refugees from European wars persecuted in\r\ntheir homelands for their ideas. Our Constitution,\r\nwhich enshrines the secularity of the State, includes a\r\nfar-reaching bill of rights that highlights democracy\r\nand the rule of law. Let me therefore reaffirm, as our\r\nPresident, Marc Forné, stated immediately after the\r\nattacks, Andorra’s condemnation of these crimes.\r\nMy country has taken appropriate measures to\r\ncombat terrorism in all its forms, and I will be signing\r\nthe United Nations Convention for the Suppression of\r\nthe Financing of Terrorism, the United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\r\nthe Conventions of the Council of Europe against\r\nterrorism and corruption.\r\nLet me assert Andorra’s belief in the role of\r\ndebate rather than violence as a necessary response to\r\nviolence — its belief that the United Nations is a vital\r\nforum for world conversation, a forum whose\r\nprinciples, and indeed whose buildings, need to be\r\ncelebrated and protected.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nLet us therefore ask ourselves what it is these\r\nterrorists want. In the videotape he released the day the\r\nAmerican bombing began, their leader announced the\r\nfollowing goals: first, the removal of American troops\r\nfrom Saudi Arabia; secondly, an end to the bombing of\r\nIraq; and, finally, a resolution of the Palestinian\r\nproblem.\r\nIt is worthwhile to note that both the presence of\r\nAmerican troops in Saudi Arabia and the bombing of\r\nIraq are the direct result of prior aggression. The\r\ninternational community has for decades sought a\r\nresolution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, but a\r\nsolution, if one is to be found, must come first and\r\nforemost from within Israel and Palestine. Their peace,\r\nif it is to be reached, cannot be imposed from without.\r\nWhile these are the proclaimed reasons for the\r\nhostility of the terrorist networks to the United States,\r\none might come to the conclusion that these stated\r\nobjectives are a screen, and that the attacks were made\r\nin order to bring about religious wars in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nFor the United States and its allies, it is a war\r\nagainst terrorism. But the terrorist networks claim it is\r\na religious war, pitting Christianity against Islam. The\r\nold rhetoric of the Crusades, such as the loss of\r\nAl-Andalus — Andalusia — in 1492 and other battles\r\nfrom history are being invoked by the terrorists to\r\ninflame the feelings of Muslims throughout the world\r\nand to bring about a fundamentalist pan-Islamic entity.\r\nThis is a delicate issue but we must face it head-on.\r\nThis crisis can be contained only if we speak bluntly\r\nand rationally.\r\nThe terrorist networks invoke history — the\r\nhistory of religious war — to inflame sentiment. Their\r\ninvocation of history, however, may be a tactical error.\r\nFor history can be our ally in the battle against\r\nterrorism and violence.\r\nI beg your pardon, but let us return to an earlier\r\npoint in history, a bloody time of religious crisis in\r\nEurope — and I am speaking about the wars of religion\r\nthat decimated sixteenth and seventeenth century\r\nEurope. Out of these wars of religion and out of the\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nbloody struggles of the Reformation came a powerful\r\nantidote to religious violence that we call humanism.\r\nThe great French humanist Michel de Montaigne was a\r\nsceptic. He wrote about the limits to human knowledge\r\nin his remarkable Essays. In one of them, entitled “Of\r\nPractice,” he observed that, although we can practice\r\nfor many things in life, there is one thing for which we\r\ncannot practice, one thing we cannot know, and that is\r\nour own death. He went on to describe the closest he\r\ncame to knowing death, an accident that happened\r\nwhen he fell from his horse. He had been out riding in\r\na militia and was nearly crushed to death. He had a\r\nbrief sensation of his soul hovering over his body, and,\r\nlater, after being taken home, terrible pain continued to\r\nplague him.\r\nAt a time of religious extremism, when Catholics\r\nand Protestants were fighting over the keys to\r\nheaven — just as the 11 September terrorists died\r\nbelieving they would enter paradise — Montaigne\r\nwrote about the limits of knowledge. And he wrote\r\nabout a personal experience, this accident, with which\r\neverybody, even now, can empathize. This is why he is\r\ncalled a humanist, because of his genuine interest in\r\nhuman experience.\r\nThere is no revealed truth in Montaigne, no\r\ndogmatism, only human scepticism that appears as an\r\nantidote — the only antidote — to the certainty of\r\nmadmen who would kill for belief. This evolution in\r\nhuman thought was accomplished without sacrificing\r\nthe freedom to believe, to have faith in God and to\r\npractice a religion. To think and write as Montaigne\r\ndid — that is, to insist on the limits of knowledge, and\r\nto speak not in a universal but in a personal voice —\r\nwas a great step forward for humankind. In turning\r\nknowledge away from religious certainty, the\r\nhumanists allowed for a new field of understanding\r\nthat we now call the sciences.\r\nWhile inquisitions would carry on for a\r\ncentury — Galileo was a boy when Montaigne was\r\nwriting — the scepticism that Montaigne advanced\r\nagainst religious violence in 1580 is the same as that\r\nwhich Boyle, Newton, or Lavoisier would apply to the\r\nuniversal truths of natural theology in order to create a\r\nway of understanding that we now recognize as\r\nscientific. Modern scientific understanding ushered in\r\nthe industrial revolutions, the astonishing explosion of\r\nthe middle class, of print culture and of the\r\nestablishment of modern democracies. It introduced all\r\nof these “world-historical” events, to use Hegel’s term\r\nthat we call, rather sloppily, “modernity.”\r\nI conclude my intervention on the subject of\r\nmodernity, because many commentators on the current\r\nwar in Afghanistan see the war framed as a war\r\nbetween the Taliban, as Islamic extremists, and\r\nmodernity. They cite the way in which the Taliban have\r\nbanned all forms of mass media culture and have\r\ninsisted on a literal application of sharia law. They\r\nargue that the Taliban are anti-modern and that their\r\nregime is trying to return its people to an earlier, pre-\r\nmodern way of life. Yet, when we examine the lives of\r\nthe 11 September terrorists, we realize first that they\r\nwere not Afghans, and second, that they were not the\r\nwretched of the earth. They were from the middle\r\nclass. Most were students, some with advanced\r\ndegrees. They never even had to work hard for a living,\r\nlike most members of the middle class. These men\r\nwere privileged murderers. Or let me put it another\r\nway: they were fully modern.\r\nThe struggle between modernity and the anti-\r\nmodern is not anachronistic. To be a terrorist demands\r\nthat you enter, systematically and rationally, into the\r\nmodern world and to turn its apparatus, such as\r\ntransportation and communication, against it. The\r\nstruggle against modernity is one of the most romantic\r\nmyths generated by modernity itself. So, too, is the\r\nmisrepresentation of the poor by certain writers and\r\nintellectuals — I need not name names — who claim to\r\nspeak for them. The suffering sown in Afghanistan by\r\ndecades of invasion and civil war, they argue, has\r\nbrought terrorism as its terrible harvest. In fact, these\r\npoor want most of all to live, and to live well. They\r\nembrace modernity and its comforts. But violence, the\r\nability to treat other people as objects, as things to be\r\ncrushed and destroyed: this is a gift bestowed by\r\neducation.\r\nThe struggle is therefore ideological. This is why\r\neducation, the greatest gift, was a passport to terrorism\r\nfor these men. The risk of education in this context is\r\nthat the pressure of knowledge, or more precisely a\r\nrecognition of uncertainties and of the limits of\r\nknowledge, will tempt the student into dogmatic belief.\r\nThe danger always exists that education can harden\r\nfrom humanistic scepticism into the rock of dogma.\r\nWhat is to be done? Today I propose an urgent\r\nreturn to a new humanism on two fronts: first, within\r\nIslam, a humanism among Muslims — politicians,\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nwriters, readers — that can dampen sectarian violence\r\nand that can reach out to religious extremism to find\r\ncommon ground. This can only come from within the\r\nIslamic world. It does not have to be secular in nature,\r\nalthough secularism has an important yet increasingly\r\nthreatened status within certain nations.\r\nCorrespondingly, there must be recognition within\r\npolitical regimes everywhere that antipathy to political\r\ndissent politicizes religion and creates more problems\r\nfor these regimes than it solves. Modernity’s belief in\r\ndemocracy as a means to popular expression has never\r\nproved more vital.\r\nSecondly, outside of Islam, a return to humanism\r\nlies at the heart of the modernity in which we are\r\nliving. To recognize modernity and its great\r\ncontribution, a secular and universal culture — mass\r\nculture — is something that needs to be protected and\r\nfought for. It is a modernity that insists on the rights of\r\nmen, women and children.\r\nWe all know that words often do not lead to\r\naction. But we forget that words, the expression of\r\nideas and of criticism, are a vital form of action. We\r\ncannot be simplistic in our desire for a direct\r\nrelationship between debate and resolution.\r\nWhat I am proposing is certainly not propaganda;\r\nrather, it is a worldwide debate on the importance of\r\ndebate, in which human scepticism, a recognition of\r\nthe limits of belief, is very much at stake. Whether this\r\nargument can be made in an urgent and anti-elitist way\r\nis very much the point. But unless we are able to\r\nrecognize modernity as a liberating experience,\r\nindependent of its accumulation of goods and services,\r\ncreature comforts, and the like, I have little hope for a\r\npositive resolution to the crisis we now face.\r\nModernity is a work in process. One name for\r\nmodernity, as it exists for us today, is globalization.\r\nThis is the creation of a “world culture”, the entry of\r\ntechnology into every aspect of our lives, the\r\nomnipresence of the media and the increasing speed by\r\nwhich culture and information are communicated. It\r\nseems to me that there is tragic confusion between\r\nglobalization and abstract and oppressive technology. It\r\nis this notion of modernity that seems to be at the heart\r\nof the recent protests against globalization, protests\r\nthat would have been the focus of our debates before\r\n11 September. While the protesters have many valid\r\npoints to make, and they need to be listened to,\r\nglobalization and modernity are not the problem.\r\nWhether cooperation between nations is economic,\r\npolitical or cultural, it is not a threat. Leaders and\r\nintellectuals need to reach out and embrace the limits\r\nof knowledge. They must speak out against dogmatism\r\nto unravel facile notions of monolithic governments or\r\nglobal compacts.\r\nAn eye for an eye, that harsh principle from the\r\nOld Testament, will soon leave us blind. Blindness,\r\nrather than insight, is the curse of the ideologue, of\r\npeople who do not want to see outside their own skins,\r\ntheir ideas or their place. It is the curse of people who\r\ndo not want to see the world in its marvellous diversity,\r\nits uncertainty and its possibilities. To see this world,\r\nwe have only to look around us here, now. We have\r\nonly to wander through the streets of this miraculous\r\ncity of New York.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nThe Honourable John Manley, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Canada.\r\nMr. Manley (Canada): It is indeed an honour to\r\nbe here in New York City and at the General Assembly.\r\nThat we are gathered here now, just two months since\r\nthe devastating terrorist attacks of 11 September,\r\ndemonstrates both the resilience of this great city and\r\nthe determination and defiance of a united global\r\ncommunity.\r\nHaving spent last Sunday — like my friend Prime\r\nMinister Dzurinda of Slovakia — running through so\r\nmany streets and communities of the five boroughs of\r\nNew York City in the annual New York City Marathon,\r\nI have witnessed personally and been quite\r\noverwhelmed by the deep reserves of courage evident\r\nin this city and in all those individuals who are\r\nchoosing to take back their lives and reject the menace\r\nof terror.\r\nOur job is to galvanize and to focus the courage\r\nof nations — to transform sentiment into commitment,\r\nand commitment into action. Expressions of a common\r\noutrage are gratifying but they will never be enough to\r\ndefeat terrorism. The ultimate success of our\r\ncampaign — this long and extremely complex\r\ncampaign — rests upon our collective ability to\r\ndemonstrate leadership, to harness political will and to\r\nsustain the commitment that we have made to each\r\nother and to our citizens: that we will not allow crimes\r\nso vile, so immense and so shattering to the world to be\r\nunanswered or ever to be repeated.\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nIn order to achieve these goals — and to merit the\r\ntrust and fulfil the expectations placed in the United\r\nNations and its constituent Member States — we\r\ncannot go on as before. There can be no more\r\n“business as usual”. There is no more time, there is no\r\nmore patience and there are no more resources for\r\ndiplomatic gamesmanship and the stoking of dangerous\r\nself-interest. National Governments must take\r\nresponsibility and be held accountable for their actions\r\nand decisions — for fighting terrorism, for undertaking\r\npolitical and legal reforms, for resolving disputes and\r\nfor establishing the conditions in which democracy\r\nflourishes and development is sustained.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe United Nations is now facing its greatest test\r\never since its creation. So far, the United Nations is\r\nperforming admirably. The unity of purpose and\r\neffective decision-making that allowed swift passage of\r\nthe landmark Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nand the rapid convening of a special debate on\r\nterrorism provide clear evidence of what we can\r\naccomplish together, and further underscore the\r\nreasons why this Organization and its esteemed\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, were deservedly\r\nrecognized with the Nobel Peace Prize this year.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe cannot, however, afford to lose ourselves in\r\ncomplacency, self-congratulation or distraction. Our\r\nwork has only just begun.\r\nHorrific as the atrocities perpetrated on 11\r\nSeptember were, terrorism did not begin here.\r\nUnfortunately, too many of us in this Hall know this all\r\ntoo painfully. No, it did not begin here; but we as a\r\nglobal community have the responsibility, and now a\r\nrenewed opportunity, to ensure that we end it — here.\r\nThe United Nations has a unique and\r\nindispensable role to play. While the campaign against\r\nterrorism will be conducted through coalitions of\r\ndifferent State actors, alliances and organizations, this\r\nis where it must ultimately all come together in its\r\npolitical, diplomatic, legal, economic, humanitarian\r\nand security dimensions. We in Canada, as long-\r\nstanding proponents of multilateralism and the United\r\nNations system, have strongly welcomed the close\r\ncollaboration evident between the United States\r\nAdministration and the United Nations over these last\r\ntwo months.\r\nIn Canada, the campaign against terrorism,\r\nincluding the obligations we have undertaken here at\r\nthe United Nations, is our highest priority. Our country,\r\nwhich shares with the United States the longest\r\nunmilitarized border in the world and the closest, most\r\nextensive and most profitable bilateral relationship\r\nanywhere, has been deeply affected by this crisis.\r\nCanadians, like Americans and citizens of many other\r\nnations, are concerned about their security, but also\r\nabout what kind of a country and what kind of a world\r\nthey are to live in after 11 September. The interlinked\r\ngoals of protecting our citizens, providing assurance to\r\nour partners and allies and preserving the character of\r\nour free, democratic and diverse society have guided\r\nthe actions and decisions of Prime Minister Chrétien\r\nand the Canadian Government throughout this crisis.\r\nWe have committed 2000 armed forces personnel,\r\nships, aircraft and special forces to the international\r\nmilitary coalition against terrorism; and at home, we\r\nhave introduced a wide range of measures, legislation\r\nand new investments to bolster our security framework,\r\nincluding at the border and at our airports.\r\nCanada welcomes the reporting and monitoring\r\nfunctions provided for in Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001). We have already implemented many of its\r\nprovisions and are moving quickly on the rest. We are\r\nwell advanced in the preparation of our report and will\r\nprovide it to the Counter-Terrorism Committee well\r\nahead of the 90-day deadline. We urge other Member\r\nnations to demonstrate their continued resolve and\r\nsolidarity by doing likewise. Canada is prepared to\r\nsupport those States for which implementation poses a\r\ngreat challenge.\r\nAs we take steps in compliance with resolution\r\n1373 (2001), we are completing our ratification of the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\r\nand the Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, which will make Canada a full\r\nparty to all 12 existing United Nations counter-\r\nterrorism conventions. Negotiations are under way on\r\nthe thirteenth convention, the comprehensive\r\nconvention against international terrorism. That\r\nconvention will ensure that all terrorist acts are\r\ncondemned under international law. What is needed\r\nnow is the political will to complete the negotiations. If\r\nnot the General Assembly of the United Nations, then\r\nwho? And if not now, then when? The time will never\r\nbe more propitious, or the need greater.\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nOur international legal framework also requires a\r\nstrong arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nregime. Implementation of the Ottawa Convention\r\nbanning anti-personnel mines is proceeding apace. To\r\nkeep weapons of mass destruction from becoming\r\nemployed as the instruments of evil, we are also hard at\r\nwork to reinforce key instruments such as the Nuclear\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty, the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency safeguards, the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention and the Biological Weapons Convention,\r\nall requiring strong multilateral action to ensure their\r\nfull implementation.\r\nI would also add that we are now very close to\r\nmaking the International Criminal Court a reality, with\r\nonly 17 more ratifications to go. The creation of the\r\nCourt will represent an extremely significant step in the\r\nongoing struggle to eliminate impunity for the worst\r\ncrimes known to humankind.\r\nThese are only the most immediate and most\r\nobvious steps to ensure our collective security, but our\r\nagenda must be far broader than this. Nothing has more\r\nviolently shaken our sense of security than have the\r\nevents of 11 September. But our conception of what\r\nconstitutes security and the nature of the threats that\r\nmay be posed to it was already undergoing dramatic\r\nevolution prior to the attacks.\r\nThe denial of human rights, the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS, persistent mass poverty, unchecked\r\nenvironmental degradation and the blight of drugs and\r\ncrime all undermine stability, reduce human potential\r\nand obstruct social and economic progress. They are\r\nthreats to human security, as are discrimination and\r\nracism, which the Durban Conference was intended to\r\naddress. Unfortunately, it failed to achieve its potential\r\nand instead provided a forum for propagating long-\r\nstanding hatreds and biases, and the world is poorer for\r\nthat.\r\nThe resolution and prevention of conflict must\r\nalso remain at the highest order of United Nations\r\nbusiness, but leadership and commitment are required\r\nif we are to move from a culture of reaction to one of\r\nprevention, as proposed by the Secretary-General.\r\nJust a week ago, I ended a five-country visit to\r\nthe Middle East. I was reassured by the commitments\r\nof my hosts to the fight against terrorism. As have\r\nothers, I urged Israel and the Palestinians to put\r\nimmediately into place measures that will bring them\r\nback to the negotiating table. That is their only way\r\nforward. The essential truth is that there is no\r\nalternative to peaceful coexistence. That conflict\r\ncannot go on forever and leaders must act now to bring\r\nit to an end. The international community must also\r\nincrease its efforts to help bring about a just peace.\r\nFinally, there is little that is more debilitating to\r\nhumankind than the ravages of extreme poverty. This is\r\nmost notable in Africa, which will be a principal focus\r\nfor the G-8 in 2002, when Canada will assume the G-8\r\nchair. Speaking at this rostrum in 1963, Prime Minister\r\nLester B. Pearson, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, warned\r\nthe world of the dangers of a growing disparity in\r\neconomic and social development between nations. He\r\nurged that this “must be corrected before it creates an\r\nunbridgeable gulf between ‘have’ and ‘have-not’\r\nnations” (A/PV.1208, para. 60). That was 38 years ago\r\nand the challenge remains more acute than ever.\r\nThe pledges of the Millennium Summit in\r\nSeptember 2000 must not be overshadowed by the\r\nurgency of the events that have taken place one year\r\nlater. Indeed, their fulfilment can and must form an\r\nintegral component of how we create a strong,\r\nequitable global environment that can be neither\r\nattacked nor exploited by terrorists.\r\nTerrorism does not speak to us; it does not speak\r\nfor anyone but criminals and murderers and it only\r\nserves to undermine the causes they purport to\r\nrepresent. It does not represent Islam; it does not\r\nreflect the will of the Afghan people.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe fate of the Afghan people must remain\r\nsharply in our focus. That country has been so\r\nneglected, so abused and so driven into isolation by its\r\nself-appointed rulers that it could not even be ranked\r\non the most recent United Nations human development\r\nindex. The rights of its people — notably women and\r\ngirls — have been blatantly and repeatedly violated.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAn acute humanitarian crisis is building and we\r\nmust do more, working with United Nations agencies\r\nand other relief organizations, to ensure that\r\ncivilians — including refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons — are protected and have access to food and to\r\naid.\r\nFor this reason, Canada responded to the United\r\nNations humanitarian appeal, adding further resources\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nto the $160 million in aid that we had already provided\r\nover the last 10 years. We were also pleased at the\r\nprompt appointment of Lakhdar Brahimi — who has\r\nplayed such an integral role in the reform of United\r\nNations peacekeeping — as the Secretary-General’s\r\nSpecial Representative for Afghanistan. Canada has\r\npledged to work with Ambassador Brahimi and other\r\ncoalition States to support the Afghan people in the\r\nsearch for a stable, fair and effective administration\r\nthat can begin the enormous task of leading\r\nAfghanistan forward to a more secure and hopeful\r\nfuture.\r\nThe opportunities for progress towards a more\r\nfree, prosperous and peaceful world have always been\r\nbefore us. In the haze of self-interest and competing\r\npriorities, sometimes our global community has not\r\nseen them so clearly. The enormous horror of 11\r\nSeptember has offered us that clarity, just as it has\r\nconcentrated minds and catalysed relationships. It has\r\ngiven us a renewed basis for cooperation between\r\nStates both in and outside the United Nations, driven\r\nnot only by the United States and its traditional allies,\r\nincluding Canada, but also through opportunities for\r\nleadership provided to Russia and China, to India and\r\nPakistan, to countries of the Middle East, North Africa,\r\nAsia and elsewhere in the resolution of this crisis.\r\nTerrorism globalizes us. It globalizes outrage and\r\ncondemnation, just as it does compassion and the cry\r\nfor justice. We must ensure that terrorism also\r\nglobalizes a sustained commitment to bringing about\r\nits end.\r\nTomorrow, 11 November, Canada and other\r\nUnited Nations Member nations will mark our annual\r\nRemembrance Day. On this day, we remember and\r\nhonour the men and women who have fought and\r\nsacrificed for our freedom. This week in New York, I\r\nhope that we will all take time to remember what it is\r\nthat we are together working — and, yes, fighting —\r\nfor today: for freedom, for peace and for justice, and\r\nfor the dignity and realization of the potential of all\r\npeoples everywhere.\r\nAs we make our speeches, file our papers and\r\npress forward our resolutions in this great Hall, let us\r\nalso remember that the words “United Nations” —\r\ncoined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942 —\r\nnot only refer to an Organization or a name on a\r\nbuilding, but were first and foremost a declaration of\r\nsolidarity and of a common vision for a better world.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Zimbabwe, His Excellency\r\nMr. Stanislaus Mudenge.\r\nMr. Mudenge (Zimbabwe): My delegation\r\ncongratulates Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. His election to that office is a demonstration of\r\nthe confidence and trust that the international\r\ncommunity has placed in him to steer it through the\r\nchallenges of our time. It is our fervent hope that,\r\nthrough his leadership, this Assembly will translate the\r\nMillennium Declaration into reality.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for the\r\nsterling work accomplished during the past session of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nToday, I am privileged to join others in\r\ncongratulating Mr. Kofi Annan for his re-election as\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General for a second term.\r\nMr. Annan’s re-election is indeed both a testimony to\r\nand recognition of his unique and rare abilities to give\r\nleadership, vision and unity of purpose to the\r\ninternational community in meeting the challenges that\r\nface us today. This recognition has been amply\r\ndemonstrated by the conferment of the prestigious\r\nNobel Peace Prize on the person of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and on the United Nations. I congratulate both\r\nMr. Annan and the United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General enters the elite corps of\r\nNobel laureates at a time of most serious challenge to\r\ninternational solidarity and cooperation, as we reflect\r\non the events of 11 September, when the people of the\r\nUnited States of America, and indeed the whole world,\r\nwere plunged into unprecedented sorrow in the wake of\r\nthe heinous terrorist attacks here in New York and in\r\nWashington. This is indisputably the most brutal act of\r\nterrorism in this new millennium. Our hearts go out to\r\nthe families who lost their loved ones, and indeed all\r\nthe people and the Government of the United States. It\r\nis our duty as Members of this world body, which\r\nstands for global harmony, peace and security, to say\r\n“Never again” to such vileness. Zimbabwe lost two of\r\nits nationals in those tragic attacks.\r\nAs the people of the United States grapple with\r\nthe threat posed by biological weapons of mass\r\ndestruction in the form of anthrax, we in Zimbabwe,\r\nwho have hitherto been the greatest victims of this\r\nweapon, know what it means and what they are going\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nthrough. For during our own liberation struggle,\r\nanthrax was used as a weapon of mass destruction by\r\nthe racist regime of Ian Smith. The anthrax was\r\ndeveloped by the apartheid regime in South Africa\r\nunder the guidance of Dr. Basson, better known as “Dr.\r\nDeath”, who then supplied it to Ian Smith. Many\r\nZimbabweans perished both before and after\r\nindependence. The anthrax spores that were spread by\r\nthe racist regime of Ian Smith during our liberation\r\nstruggle more than 20 years ago continue to claim\r\nvictims exclusively within the black population of our\r\ncountry to this day. More people and cattle have died of\r\nanthrax this year in Zimbabwe than elsewhere in the\r\nworld. Thus not only are we vehemently opposed to\r\nthis evil scourge and other forms of terrorism, but we\r\nalso know the pain and loss associated with it.\r\nIn my address to the General Assembly at last\r\nyear’s session, I dwelt at length on the situation in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. Since that time,\r\nsome progress has been made in implementing the\r\nceasefire agreement in that country. All those involved\r\nin the process — the signatories to the ceasefire\r\nagreement and the United Nations Security Council —\r\nare agreed that conditions are favourable for the\r\ndeployment of United Nations peacekeepers under\r\nphase III of the deployment of the United Nations\r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo (MONUC). As a matter of fact, just\r\nyesterday, the Security Council adopted resolution\r\n1376 (2001), supporting the launching of phase III\r\ndeployment of MONUC. Nevertheless, the Security\r\nCouncil, by adopting what it calls a step-by-step\r\napproach, continues to show excessive caution or\r\nhesitancy, almost indistinguishable from lack of\r\ncommitment or confidence, in the peace process in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. This is the major\r\nthreat to that peace process today.\r\nI wish to renew our appeal to the Security\r\nCouncil to more strongly and convincingly demonstrate\r\nits support for peace in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo by providing adequate human, financial and\r\nother resources. In this context, we note that as of 30\r\nSeptember 2001, unpaid assessed contributions for\r\nMONUC to the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nspecial account amounted to $246.9 million. In\r\naddition, the trust fund established by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in October 1999 to support the peace process\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo had, two\r\nyears later, received only the paltry sum of $1.1\r\nmillion.\r\nThe serious matter of inadequate resources was\r\none of the major factors that contributed to the\r\ncurtailment, both in number of participants and in\r\nduration, of the inter-Congolese dialogue in Addis\r\nAbaba last month. We welcome and appreciate South\r\nAfrica’s offer to host the next session of the national\r\ndialogue and meet some of the related expenses. We\r\nhasten to add, however, that South Africa must not be\r\nburdened and abandoned because of this generosity and\r\nwillingness to contribute to the peacemaking efforts.\r\nWe all must play our part in restoring peace and\r\nstability to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and\r\nindeed to the Great Lakes region.\r\nThe continued unnecessary suffering and loss of\r\nlife among the civilians in Angola are indefensible.\r\nThrough the Sanctions Committee and other measures,\r\nwe have determined that UNITA must be denied and\r\ndeprived of the resources and means to continue to\r\nwage war against the Angolan people. It is time that we\r\nensure that those sanctions are indeed effective by not\r\nonly respecting that sanctions regime ourselves, but\r\nalso exposing those who continue to aid and abet\r\nUNITA in its deadly activities.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East demands urgent\r\naction and resolution on the basis of the long-standing\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973). The question of a Palestinian State brooks no\r\ndelay. Israel must bite the bullet and accept that until a\r\nPalestinian State becomes a reality, there can never be\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nI must express our concern over the lack of\r\nprogress in the area of reforming the Security Council\r\nto make it more democratic and fully representative of\r\nthe aspirations of a large section of the international\r\ncommunity which has had a limited voice for far too\r\nlong. It is our considered view that conflict resolution\r\naround the globe could be enhanced by a reformed and\r\nmore representative Security Council.\r\nOn the eve of the Doha meeting, my delegation\r\nwould like to stress that necessary measures must be\r\ntaken to strengthen the ability of developing countries\r\nto be integrated in a beneficial way into the global\r\nsystem. The human and institutional capacities of\r\ndeveloping countries must be strengthened, and more\r\nemphasis must be placed on enhancing the role of trade\r\nand development, with better access provided for goods\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nand services from developing countries. Currently, we\r\nare experiencing a situation in which developing\r\ncountries in general, and African, Caribbean and\r\nPacific countries in particular, seem to lose through the\r\nWorld Trade Organization arrangement the little that\r\nthey had gained, even from previous protocols.\r\nOne of the most enduring features of the present\r\nand of the latter part of the last century has been the\r\npersistence of the colonial legacy in many developing\r\ncountries. That legacy has been evident in relations\r\nbetween and within States. We need not recall much\r\nmore evidence of the persistence of this phenomenon\r\nthan the proceedings of the World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa,\r\nbarely two months ago.\r\nThe continued refusal on the part of some former\r\ncolonial Powers to acknowledge the devastating effects\r\nthat colonialism has had, and continues to have, on the\r\neconomic development of most of the former colonies\r\nhas also been much in evidence. It is no accident that it\r\nis those former colonies that today occupy the lower\r\nrungs of the development totem pole.\r\nIn Zimbabwe, the colonial legacy is poignantly\r\nevident in the racially skewed land-ownership\r\nstructure, which is a direct result of racist policies and\r\nthe laws of successive colonial regimes between 1890\r\nand 1980. Over 70 per cent of the arable land — the\r\nbest of that land — is owned and utilized by less than 1\r\nper cent of the population, represented by\r\napproximately 4,100 white farmers, most of them of\r\nBritish descent, while nearly 13 million black\r\nZimbabweans eke out a living from the remaining 30\r\nper cent — the worst of the arable land. Such a\r\nsituation has to be corrected in the interests of equity,\r\njustice, social harmony and political stability in the\r\ncountry and, indeed, in our region of southern Africa.\r\nMy Government has begun a land reform and\r\nredistribution programme, which, while ensuring that\r\nmore people are settled on acquired land, will leave the\r\ncurrent owners with only one farm each. At present,\r\nsome of them own 18 farms each — and an average\r\nfarm in Zimbabwe is 2,000 hectares. Some, like the\r\nOpenheimer family, own land that is nearly the size of\r\nBelgium — one man owns property the size of\r\nBelgium in Zimbabwe. My Government’s land reform\r\nprogramme guarantees that none of the white farmers\r\nwill be left landless. Every existing white farmer who\r\nwants to farm is assured of getting one farm. The\r\nprogramme is not about total alienation or\r\ndispossession, but about equitable redistribution. What\r\nis more generous or equitable than that?\r\nAs to who should pay for compensation, we\r\nreached understandings and agreements with the\r\nformer colonial master when we negotiated our\r\nindependence at Lancaster House in 1979. Obligations\r\nto pay compensation were assumed by the former\r\ncolonial Power. Provided that all parties honour their\r\nobligations, the so-called land crisis in Zimbabwe will\r\nevaporate overnight. That is the crisis in my country, to\r\nwhich the spokesman of the European Union referred\r\nfrom this rostrum. Zimbabwe has policemen in\r\nKosovo, policemen in Sierra Leone and policemen in\r\nEast Timor. We are trying to bring peace to the Congo.\r\nWe do not have a crisis; we have a land dispute.\r\nThe lofty objectives of the United Nations\r\nCharter in the economic arena will remain unfulfilled\r\nunless all Member States join in efforts, genuinely and\r\nseriously, to redress inherited colonial imbalances that\r\npersist in developing countries. Social justice, political\r\nstability and sustainable development in Zimbabwe can\r\nbe better achieved through genuine and committed\r\nsupport for land redistribution programmes than\r\nthrough the vilification or demonization of its\r\nleadership and policies.\r\nIt is most unfortunate that our efforts at rectifying\r\nunsustainable colonial imbalances are seen by some as\r\na crisis; the real crisis lies in the persistence of that\r\nlegacy. Zimbabweans are resolved to correct that\r\ncolonial injustice, in spite of the outcry from some\r\nquarters by people who regard the defence of the\r\npresent injustice as their historic responsibility. It is\r\nunacceptable that a minority, whether black or white,\r\nshould own over 70 per cent of the best arable land in\r\nany country. That may be acceptable in some countries;\r\nin Zimbabwe, we have decided to say “No”.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a serious\r\ndevelopmental issue. As the Secretary-General’s report\r\non the work of the Organization (A56/1) indicates, the\r\npandemic is destroying the economic and social fabric\r\nin our countries. Zimbabwe’s infection rate among the\r\nadult population is estimated to be 30 per cent, while\r\nhundreds of thousands of children have already been\r\norphaned as a result of this dreaded disease. In the light\r\nof this, my Government and, indeed, those of other\r\ndeveloping countries, will need all the assistance we\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\ncan get to complement our own efforts. We look\r\nforward to having this issue be seriously addressed by\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe international community should develop\r\nstrategies to ensure that AIDS drugs developed by\r\npharmaceutical companies become more affordable for\r\ndeveloping countries. Let me extend my sincere thanks\r\nto the Secretary-General for convening the special\r\nsession on HIV/AIDS in June this year. We hope that\r\nthe implementation of the resolutions of that\r\nconference will go some way towards checking the\r\nspread of the disease.\r\nIn conclusion, let me assure one and all that\r\nZimbabwe will partner all international efforts towards\r\nthe eradication of terrorism in all its forms, as well as\r\nexert all its energy in combating the pestilences that\r\nafflict humanity, especially poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Roberto Flores Bermúdez.\r\nMr. Flores Bermúdez (Honduras) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At this juncture, when humanity is faced with\r\nvarious challenges, it is essential that the United\r\nNations receive the broadest and most firm support as\r\nit plays the role of coordinator of our collective efforts.\r\nThe 2001 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to the\r\nSecretary-General and to the United Nations as a\r\nwhole, is a further reaffirmation of trust in this\r\nuniversal Organization, which was created to banish\r\nviolence and to further human development. We\r\nwarmly congratulate the Secretary-General and the\r\nofficials and employees of the Organization.\r\nThe international turmoil brought about by the\r\nterrorist attack of 11 September against the people and\r\nthe Government of the United States of America, as\r\nwell as against the highest values of the civilized\r\nworld, has radically altered the way in which we think\r\nabout international security. Our own people are not\r\nimmune from this new reality. Buried under the rubble\r\nof the World Trade Center are the remains of\r\nHondurans who had come to this country to turn their\r\nhopes into reality. The President of the United States,\r\nin his statement this morning, referred to the many\r\ncountries whose nationals perished in the twin towers.\r\nIt is, indeed, an international phenomenon.\r\nThe Presidents of the Central American countries,\r\nat the invitation of the President of Honduras, Mr.\r\nCarlos Flores, met in Honduras on 19 September and\r\nadopted specific joint steps to be taken at the\r\nsubregional level to combat terrorism. The purpose is\r\nto contribute, within our modest capacities, to that end,\r\nwhich is synonymous with the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Those steps include\r\ncontrols on migration and financial flows and\r\nintelligence sharing in the framework of the\r\nOrganization of American States and the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Government of Honduras notes with deep\r\nconcern the escalating violence in the Middle East. In\r\nthe light of the circumstances at the time, we supported\r\nthe establishment of the State of Israel. Today, we want\r\nto use this international forum, which plays a critical\r\nrole in the search for a solution in the region, to\r\nreaffirm the right of Israel to exist as a sovereign, free\r\nand secure States. We also support recognition of the\r\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and to the establishment of a Palestinian\r\nState. We are convinced that that constitutes a suitable\r\nformula for real peace in the Middle East.\r\nIn his introductory remarks today, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral expressed his grief and revulsion at the\r\ncowardly acts of international terrorism. He also wisely\r\nnoted that none of the other problems before us has\r\nbecome any less urgent. In addition to terrorism, other\r\ngrave dangers threaten peace and the well-being of\r\nindividuals. Among them is HIV/AIDS, which was the\r\nfocus of a special session of the General Assembly,\r\nheld from 25 to 27 June 2001. That collective\r\nendeavour led to the establishment of a global\r\nHIV/AIDS and health fund to support joint measures\r\nagainst the pandemic. The special session raised the\r\nlevel of understanding of the scope of the pandemic,\r\nwhich goes beyond health, because it also has a social\r\nand economic impact.\r\nThe June session forged links of cooperation\r\namong nations with a view to sharing experience and\r\nsolutions in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In particular,\r\nit is essential to reduce the cost of drugs: in Honduras,\r\nas in many other countries, most of the infected and\r\ntheir families cannot afford the necessary treatment.\r\nBrazil’s agreements with pharmaceutical companies in\r\nthis field are worthy of emulation. This should be a\r\ngoal in dealing with diseases that hit the developing\r\ncountries hardest.\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nIn Honduras, we are encouraged by the fact that\r\nthe rate at which the virus is spreading has slowed.\r\nForecasts two years ago overestimated today’s levels of\r\ninfection – although these continue to be high. The\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific\r\nOrganization is helping us to set up a regional AIDS\r\nprevention centre at San Pedro Sula to serve the entire\r\nCentral American region.\r\nExtreme poverty is another major threat to the\r\npeace and welfare of individuals. Here too, the United\r\nNations deserves the support of the entire international\r\ncommunity in helping overcome the causes of extreme\r\npoverty through strategic measures aimed at offering\r\nopportunities to sectors that are now excluded so that\r\nthey can enjoy a decent life and be a productive part of\r\ntheir societies. That does not mean only vocational and\r\ntechnological training; ignoring the hardship caused by\r\nwidespread illiteracy would amount to condemning 70\r\nper cent of the world’s population to wretchedness. The\r\nUnited Nations has come forward with valuable\r\ninternational initiatives.\r\nFor its part, Honduras has adopted a poverty\r\nreduction strategy in which education plays a\r\nfundamental role. This grew out of a national\r\nconsensus which in turn holds the key to country’s\r\nrecovery and transformation in the aftermath of\r\nhurricane Mitch.\r\nThe United Nations must promote fundamental\r\ndemocratic freedoms, including participation and\r\nlegitimate representation in decision-making processes.\r\nHere the Organization has played an ever-growing role\r\nin facilitating dialogue and promoting consensus. In\r\nrecent years, Honduras has held a national dialogue in\r\na variety of fields of vital importance for the nation’s\r\nfuture. The results have been promising. In addition to\r\nformulating a national-reconstruction plan to overcome\r\nthe unprecedented damage caused by hurricane Mitch\r\nthree years ago, the Government of President Carlos\r\nFlores, in one of the broadest consultative processes in\r\nour history as a republic, has, together with our people,\r\nadopted a 15-year strategy for poverty reduction. That\r\nis the first plan of its kind, arrived at through a national\r\nconsensus, to be adopted by my country.\r\nAlleviating poverty, overcoming educational\r\nbackwardness, responding to epidemics and reducing\r\nour vulnerability to natural phenomena: all are linked\r\nto economic output and to its intelligent distribution.\r\nWe are thus aware that it is not only underpinnings in\r\nthe form of programmes that are needed; fairness and\r\njustice in international trade are also required. To be\r\nconsistent with the rhetoric of international trade, we\r\nneed better access to major markets. Agricultural\r\nproducts of developed countries must no longer be so\r\nheavily subsidized, so that the products of those of us\r\nwho are handicapped by our level of development can\r\nbe more competitive in line with the principles of that\r\nrhetoric. What is good for some should be good for all.\r\nWe need a level playing field that takes into account\r\nasymmetries and conditions on all sides.\r\nPolitical maturity in Member States is intimately\r\nbound up with how well those States meet their\r\ninternational obligations. Peace, tranquillity, the ability\r\nto cooperate and interdependence are all intertwined\r\nwith how seriously international relations are\r\nconducted. The much-quoted third paragraph of the\r\npreamble of the Charter of the United Nations says that\r\nwe, the peoples of the United Nations, are determined\r\n“to establish conditions under which justice and\r\nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties\r\nand other sources of international law can be\r\nmaintained”.\r\nIndeed, adherence to the principle of pacta sunt\r\nservanda and other sources of international obligations\r\nis a factor for building trust among States. Its absence\r\nposes a threat to the Organization’s guiding spirit and\r\nto the principles that are its pillars.\r\nThe President of Mexico, His Excellency Mr.\r\nVicente Fox, has invited the States of the Caribbean to\r\nattend a conference to promote the implementation of\r\ntheir commitments on maritime limits under the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. As a State\r\nparty to that Convention, my country supports the\r\nMexican Government’s initiative. Moreover, on a\r\nbilateral level, we are pursuing in good faith and in\r\nconformity with international law the early conclusion\r\nof treaties on maritime limits with our Caribbean Sea\r\nneighbours. We applaud the efforts now under way\r\nunder a special process, sponsored by the Organization\r\nof American States, by our neighbours Belize and\r\nGuatemala towards a final solution to the century-long\r\nterritorial dispute. Such a solution should include, to\r\nthe extent possible and with the participation of the\r\nthree States directly concerned — Belize, Guatemala\r\nand Honduras — the adoption of stable legal\r\nagreements on cooperation in the Gulf of Honduras.\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.45\r\nHonduras believes that disputes are an integral\r\npart of inter-State relations. What is alarming is not\r\nthat there should be differences between States; rather,\r\nit is the attitude with which they are approached.\r\nSimilarly, we note that domestic political concerns\r\nshould not be allowed to interfere with shared interests\r\nin subregional integration. To allow our domestic\r\npolitical goals to affect our integration process would\r\nmean endangering the future of integration itself, and\r\nthus the future of the shared interests of the Central\r\nAmerican countries.\r\nWe have a united Organization, all of whose\r\nvarious bodies and specialized agencies are working\r\never more closely together in pursuit of specific\r\nobjectives. This is a time of extraordinary importance\r\nfor the international community and hence for the\r\nUnited Nations and all of its Member States.\r\nAccordingly, we must work ever harder to promote the\r\nvalues of peace and human development that we all\r\nshare. In this endeavour, all countries, small and large,\r\nmust abide by the guidelines which we, the majority,\r\nhave agreed upon in order to save our planet from\r\nclimate change, whose damaging effects are making\r\nthemselves felt everywhere.\r\nAt this juncture the Organization should continue\r\nand expand its leadership and allow all peaceful\r\ninternational players, including the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan, to participate in the joint combat against the\r\nrenewed threats to peace, security and the welfare of all\r\nnations. All of this applies to the international arena.\r\nAt the national level, organization at the local\r\ncommunity level is essential in order to dispel\r\nuncertainty, overcome indifference and strengthen\r\nhuman solidarity based on reason. This was the case\r\nduring the recent floods along the Atlantic coast of\r\nHonduras. As a result of the preparation and prevention\r\nprogrammes promoted by the Administration of\r\nPresident Flores, the loss of life was minimal, and\r\nemergency support services operated effectively and in\r\na timely manner. This was because the local\r\ncommunities had learned how to prevent most of the\r\ndamage caused by such natural phenomena.\r\nThe lesson is clear: at the national and\r\ninternational levels, we must try to organize our work\r\nas individuals and as countries and to coordinate those\r\nefforts in order to reduce our vulnerability in all areas,\r\nbe they environmental, economic, political or security-\r\nrelated, on the basis of the principles of a culture of\r\npeace, which we have agreed upon together.\r\nIn a few months’ time, President Flores will\r\nconclude his term of office. He will leave behind a\r\nstable country with transparency restored, the rule of\r\nlaw strengthened and a macroeconomic administration\r\nrecognized by the international community — a\r\ncountry that has recorded positive economic growth\r\ndespite having suffered the greatest natural disaster in\r\nour history.\r\nI conclude this address — the last to be delivered\r\nby the present Government of Honduras in the General\r\nAssembly’s general debate — by conveying the\r\ngreetings and appreciation of the people of Honduras\r\nand of the Government of President Flores to the\r\ninternational community and to all of the peoples who\r\nhave stood by us during the most difficult moments of\r\nour history. Those have included, as we will all recall,\r\nthe terrible hurricane of 1998 and its negative\r\nconsequences, which have affected us ever since. We\r\nHondurans have renewed our faith in international\r\nsolidarity and have grown stronger in our conviction\r\nthat the destiny of our nation and of our planet hinges\r\non what we are doing today to build a future for our\r\nnations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.20 p.m.\r\n"
