(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Glafcos Clerides, President\r\nof the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Clerides: I would like to extend my\r\nwarmest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\r\nwell-deserved election as President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I also extend my\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for\r\nhis effective leadership during his presidency.\r\nThe heinous terrorists attacks of 11 September\r\nhave undeniably transformed international relations.\r\nThe United Nations is called upon to reinforce its\r\nprimary role as the standard bearer of the principles\r\nthat will shape the new environment and unite\r\nhumanity in the pursuit of justice, tolerance, the dignity\r\nof human beings, respect for human rights, the\r\npromotion of peace and zero-tolerance for the dark\r\nforces of terrorism.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of\r\nCyprus, I reiterate our deep condolences and sympathy\r\nto the American people for the tragic loss of innocent\r\nlives caused by the abhorrent terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember. We unreservedly condemn these barbaric\r\nacts, which we consider to be attacks against the values\r\nand principles of humanity.\r\nThe community of nations must individually and\r\ncollectively take concerted and resolute action against\r\nterrorism. We believe that there is no justification or\r\nexcuse for terrorism and, at the same time, we reject\r\nany notion of linking this scourge with any particular\r\nreligious faith or ethnic group. We renew our\r\ncommitment to implement fully Security Council\r\nresolutions on terrorism, in particular resolution 1373\r\n(2001). Cyprus is actively participating in the common\r\neffort. It has ratified or acceded to nine of the 12\r\ninternational conventions pertaining to international\r\nterrorism. Furthermore, we expect an early ratification\r\nof the most recent Convention for the Suppression of\r\nthe Financing of Terrorism, which is already before the\r\nHouse of Representatives.\r\nThe Council of Ministers of the Republic of\r\nCyprus approved on 20 September a comprehensive\r\nproposal for the establishment of a task force to combat\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations continues to be faced with\r\nold and new tasks: globalization, good governance,\r\nprotection of the environment and the need for\r\nsustainable development. The elimination of poverty\r\nand pandemics, securing a world free from the threat of\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nweapons of mass destruction and maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security remain high on the\r\nagenda. That is why we consider it imperative and the\r\nduty of each and every Member to provide the\r\nnecessary resources and support to our Organization.\r\nCyprus strongly supports the implementation of\r\nthe commitments we undertook last year in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. We also advocate the\r\nstrengthening and rationalization of the United Nations\r\nsystem, and we welcome the commitment of the\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, to strive for a better\r\nand more just world. We congratulate him on the award\r\nof this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, which is well-\r\ndeserved recognition of the central role of the United\r\nNations and a tribute to its achievements, as well as to\r\nhis personal devotion and commitment.\r\nAt the beginning of this new millennium, we have\r\na special obligation to place new emphasis on the\r\npromotion and the protection of human rights and the\r\ndefeat of terrorism.\r\nHowever, the adoption of declarations and legal\r\ninstruments in the area of human rights is not enough.\r\nWe need to make accountable those violators of human\r\nrights and decisively strike at the culture of impunity.\r\nThis is why Cyprus strongly supports the early entry\r\ninto force of the International Criminal Court.\r\nWe are also deeply concerned with the increasing\r\nnumber and scope of humanitarian emergencies leading\r\nto an ever-rising number of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons. The plight of these unfortunate\r\npeople merits special attention and coordinated action.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have\r\nhighlighted the need to continue and accelerate efforts\r\nto prevent and resolve regional conflicts. The inability\r\nof the international community to put an end to the\r\nunacceptable situation in the Middle East undermines\r\nthe credibility of the system of collective security.\r\nCyprus, as a neighbouring country with close relations\r\nto the peoples of the region, is particularly pained by\r\nthe continuing cycle of violence, the tragic loss of\r\ninnocent human lives and the plight of the Palestinian\r\npopulation.\r\nWe look forward to a region living in peace,\r\nstability and security for all States, including the State\r\nof Israel. We reiterate our support for the fulfilment of\r\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding the creation of their own State. We urge both\r\nparties to work immediately towards finding ways to\r\nput an end to this cycle of violence and to respect the\r\nprovisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention. We\r\nconsider the implementation of the recommendations\r\nof the Mitchell report as an absolutely necessary first\r\nstep in this direction. Cyprus reiterates its long-held\r\nposition for the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).\r\nWe follow the situation in the Balkans with\r\nparticular interest. Cyprus supports the implementation\r\nof Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) on Kosovo.\r\nWe hope that the forces of peace and reconciliation will\r\nprevail and welcome the recent positive developments\r\nin the country. We support respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, including the right of return of\r\nrefugees and the return of property of displaced\r\npersons, and the principle of the inviolability of\r\nborders and territorial integrity.\r\nResolution of the Cyprus problem is long\r\noverdue. I cannot conceal my deep disappointment,\r\nshared by the Security Council in its statement to the\r\nPress of 26 September, at the refusal of the Turkish\r\nside to continue with the proximity talks to help the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to find a comprehensive\r\nsettlement. The refusal of Turkish Cypriot leader\r\nMr. Denktash, with the support of Ankara, to resume\r\nthe talks that he abandoned a year ago, despite the\r\nofficial invitation extended by the Secretary-General in\r\nSeptember, is particularly disturbing.\r\nThe Secretary-General is now trying to invigorate\r\nthe process of negotiation. Therefore, in order to\r\nfacilitate the Secretary-General’s effort, I will refrain\r\nfrom making remarks that normally I would have\r\nmade, other than to identify the reason for the failure to\r\nmake progress, which is the lack of political will on the\r\npart of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leader,\r\nMr. Denktash.\r\nThe Turkish side has abandoned the concept of a\r\nbi-zonal, bi-communal federal Cyprus, which Security\r\nCouncil resolutions have provided as the basis for the\r\nsolution. The Turkish side is also calling the\r\ninternational community to accept the so-called\r\nrealities, which is the legalization of Turkey’s\r\noccupation of 37 per cent of Cypriot territory, in breach\r\nof international law, the forceful expulsion of Greek\r\nCypriot refugees from the occupied area and the\r\nsubsequent importation of 120,000 settlers from\r\nmainland Turkey in an effort to change the\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\ndemographic character of Cyprus. As is well known,\r\nthe international community, through a plethora of\r\nUnited Nations resolutions, has repeatedly rejected this\r\npolicy. Acceptance of these so-called realities would\r\ncreate a very dangerous precedent in international\r\naffairs, striking at the very heart of the cherished\r\nprinciples of State sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nI would like to refer to the purely humanitarian\r\nproblem of missing persons, the resolution of which\r\nremains one of the most pressing issues for the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Cyprus and for all\r\nCypriots.\r\nUnfortunately, Mr. President, I must once again\r\nreport to you that the agreement on missing persons of\r\n31 July 1997 between Mr. Rauf Denktash and myself,\r\nproviding for the exchange of information and for\r\ninformation on the location of graves of Greek Cypriot\r\nand Turkish Cypriot missing persons, has not been\r\nimplemented because of the continuing negative\r\nattitude of the Turkish side. We appeal again to the\r\nGovernment of Turkey to show the necessary political\r\nwill in order to bring a final solution to this tragic\r\nhumanitarian issue and abide by the l0 May 2001\r\njudgement of the European Court of Human Rights.\r\nIn the face of current difficulties, we do not\r\ndespair. Our vision for Cyprus is a departure from the\r\npassions of the past. History is often described as the\r\nbest teacher of wise men. We see as the future of our\r\ncountry: a reunited federal State, member of the\r\nEuropean Union, with human and other rights of each\r\nand every citizen fully protected under the process of\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. We see a State with a\r\nsingle citizenship, sovereignty and international\r\npersonality, a demilitarized State enjoying the fruits of\r\nits labours in the wider European family, while at the\r\nsame time playing its rightful role in our immediate\r\nregion of the Eastern Mediterranean.\r\nI recommend to the leadership of Turkey that it\r\nabandon its threats to annex the occupied part of\r\nCyprus. I urge them to consider the obvious advantages\r\nof the solution of the Cyprus problem for stability in\r\nour region, the consolidation of the Greco-Turkish\r\nrapprochement and the promotion of Turkey’s\r\naspirations to join the process of European integration.\r\nI urge the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Denktash,\r\nto join me in sharing the vision of a Cyprus too small\r\nto be divided but huge for the common prosperity of all\r\nits inhabitants. I urge him to look to the future and not\r\nto the past, to listen to the increasingly desperate\r\nvoices of our Turkish Cypriot compatriots and stop\r\nplacing obstacles, at each turn, to the good offices of\r\nthe Secretary-General for a solution to the Cyprus\r\nproblem.\r\nIt is noteworthy that the economic prospects for a\r\npost-settlement Cyprus are truly impressive. This\r\ngrowth will be even greater for our Turkish Cypriot\r\ncompatriots, who are currently suffering because of the\r\ndire political and economic situation in the occupied\r\narea. Tragically, almost 50 per cent have been forced to\r\ntake the cruel road of emigration. The Turkish Cypriots\r\nwill benefit considerably from the accession of our\r\ncountry to the European Union.\r\nI urge Mr. Denktash to realize that he and I are\r\nnot getting any younger and that we owe it to the\r\nyounger generations of Cypriots to do away with the\r\nwalls of division. For my part, I reiterate my readiness\r\nto engage in the process of negotiations with the\r\nnecessary political will and good faith for finding a fair\r\nand viable solution based on the United Nations\r\nresolutions, meeting the legitimate interests of all\r\nCypriots.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Glafcos Clerides, President of the Republic of\r\nCyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the\r\nRepublic of Croatia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Croatia.\r\nMr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Stjepan Mesić, President\r\nof the Republic of Croatia, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Mesić (spoke in Croatian; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): I wanted to come here,\r\nand I had to come here. I thought it was necessary to\r\nshow that I will not allow those fanatic killers, who\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nmay be secretly lurking right now, to prevent me from\r\npresenting the general views of my country, the\r\nRepublic of Croatia, about the current situation in the\r\nworld in front of this audience in the United Nations.\r\nThis year, the general debate is taking place later\r\nthan usual. The terrorist attacks on New York and\r\nWashington postponed the scheduled autumn session. I\r\nemphasize the word “postponed”. The terrorists did not\r\nmanage to paralyse the United States of America. They\r\ndid not manage to stop the work of the United Nations;\r\nnor will the world’s statesmen cancel their visits to\r\nNew York and their participation in the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nSince 11 September, when as if in a nightmare we\r\nwere faced with the horror of global terrorism, it has\r\nbeen repeatedly said by many people, including myself,\r\nthat the world is no longer the same. I am here today to\r\nrepeat this, and also to add a few more words. It is true,\r\nor at least it seems to be true, that the terrorist attacks,\r\nwhich left thousands of deaths behind, have changed\r\neverything. However, the truth is slightly different:\r\nmuch has changed as a result of the attacks, but\r\nnothing has changed in the area that made it possible\r\nfor the attacks to be committed.\r\nI would therefore like to stress the following\r\npoints. In order to make sure that the terror experienced\r\nby New York and Washington will not happen again,\r\nwe — I repeat, we — have to change the world\r\ncompletely.\r\nToday we live with the threat of global terrorism,\r\nand the global response to it. With regard to the nature\r\nof this first big war of the twenty-first century, I can\r\nonly repeat what I recently mentioned in my speech in\r\nthe Israeli parliament, the Knesset. This is not a clash\r\nof civilizations; this is not a clash of cultures; this is\r\nnot a conflict of religions. This is just a confrontation\r\nof civilization and non-civilization.\r\nI would also like to be very clear about something\r\nelse. There is no such thing as “our” or “their”\r\nterrorism. There is no justified or unjustified terrorism.\r\nIt is in the nature of terrorism, regardless of whether it\r\nis masked by an ideology, religion or war of liberation,\r\nto kill innocent people — the more, the better.\r\nTerrorism is therefore absolutely unacceptable, and this\r\nis why we are fighting against it today.\r\nWe have created a broad anti-terrorist coalition,\r\nan alliance of countries not previously known in\r\nhistory, which can only be compared to the anti-fascist\r\ncoalition at the time of the Second World War. This\r\nanti-terrorist coalition is almost an alliance of the\r\ncivilized world, a defence response of that world to the\r\nchallenge and threat of destruction and anarchy. I\r\nwould like to stress two things with respect to the\r\nresponse and the circumstances in which it is taking\r\nplace.\r\nFirst, today we are not faced with the dilemma of\r\nchoosing between anarchy imposed upon us by the\r\nterrorists, on the one hand, and autocracy, which some\r\ncould perhaps see as the only efficient response to\r\nglobal terrorism on the other. To accept that dilemma\r\nwould be fatal for our civilization. The response is, and\r\ncan only be, democracy and the rule of law. The\r\ndefence of democracy must not turn it into its very\r\nopposite, even under the conditions of war imposed\r\nupon us by the terrorists.\r\nSecondly, the establishment of the anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition represents the beginning of profound and far-\r\nreaching changes on the world political scene. I am\r\nspeaking about changes in relations between countries\r\nor groups of countries. I am also speaking about\r\nchanges in the nature and way of functioning of\r\ninternational alliances, such as the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization, as well as existing international\r\norganizations like the United Nations and those\r\norganizations that are just emerging, of which the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is one example.\r\nHowever, while we are still combating global\r\nterrorism using our military, political and economic\r\nforce and intelligence organizations, we must start\r\nlooking for answers to the following questions: What is\r\nglobal terrorism and what makes it possible? It is not\r\nenough to defeat the terrorists we are faced with today.\r\nWe have to do everything we can to make sure that we\r\nshall not be dealing with new terrorists tomorrow. This\r\nis the second level of change that needs to be carried\r\nout, but that is not yet being made. I view the situation\r\nas follows.\r\nIt will not be difficult to encourage fanatic\r\nbehaviour in both individuals and large groups of\r\npeople — thus turning them into ruthless killers or\r\nterrorists — as long as famine, poverty and non-\r\ndevelopment are present in large parts of the world,\r\nand as long as people anywhere suffer from inequality\r\nand the absence of freedom as a result of unresolved\r\nregional crises. I therefore think that we have to change\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nthe world completely, if we do not want our present\r\nfight against global terrorism and our victory over it, of\r\nwhich I have no doubt, to be mere episodes.\r\nThat might sound too ambitious or even a bit\r\nutopian, but I believe it is neither of the two. I am sure\r\nthat, in addition to the fight against terrorism, there is\r\nanother task ahead of us that is no less difficult or\r\nresponsible, namely, creating and implementing a\r\nglobal strategy for solving accumulated problems of\r\ntoday’s world, problems that did not appear only\r\nyesterday. Many of them have been discussed under the\r\ndome of the General Assembly. Many beautiful words\r\nhave been said. It is now time to turn those words into\r\nactions. It is now time for those actions to stop ugly,\r\nabominable words full of hatred and hostility from\r\nturning into new acts of madness such as the ones we\r\nsaw in this city. We have a common interest: life in\r\npeace and safety for all. Let us have a common goal,\r\ntoo: a life of dignity for all. Neither can be achieved\r\ntomorrow everywhere, but both can be achieved\r\neverywhere.\r\nI would like this session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly to reaffirm this world Organization\r\nas an irreplaceable instrument in the struggle for a\r\ndifferent and better world. I would like this session to\r\nshow the political will of all Member States to start\r\nseeking together — and finding — in a sincere and\r\ncoordinated way, solutions to problems that, in the\r\ncontext of the threat of global terrorism, prove to be\r\nliterally unavoidable.\r\nLet us not forget that in September the terrorists\r\nused planes full of passengers in order to kill thousands\r\nof people. The next time they may use chemical,\r\nbiological or, perhaps, even nuclear weapons to kill\r\nhundreds of thousands of people. Let us also not forget\r\nthat this Organization was founded to “save succeeding\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war”. There is no time\r\nto lose. Let us change the world we live in so as to be\r\nable to continue to live.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Croatia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Stjepan Mesić, President of the Republic of\r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Luis Ángel González Macchi,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Luis Ángel González Macchi, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Luis Ángel González\r\nMacchi, President of the Republic of Paraguay, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident González Macchi (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAs I begin my statement in the general debate, allow\r\nme to express to you, Mr. Han Seung-soo, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Korea, the pleasure\r\nof my delegation at seeing you preside over the work\r\nof this session of the General Assembly. Your personal\r\nand professional qualities, with which we are familiar,\r\nwill ensure the success of our work. Your election is\r\nalso recognition of the sisterly Republic of Korea, a\r\ncountry with which we have close links of cooperation\r\nand friendship. You can be sure of the steadfast and\r\ndetermined support of the delegation of Paraguay as\r\nyou carry out your duties.\r\nLikewise, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nrecognize the work being done by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, who was\r\nrecently honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize for his\r\ndedication to the cause of the United Nations, which is\r\npeace itself. We are certain that under his leadership,\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations will reach all peoples\r\nand the Organization will adapt itself to the new reality\r\nand important challenges imposed on us by the context\r\nof international politics.\r\nAllow me today, two months after the tragic and\r\ncondemnable events of 11 September, to reiterate the\r\nsolidarity of my Government and of the people of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay with the Government and people\r\nof the United States and state our unswerving\r\ncommitment to the fight against terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations. The Republic of Paraguay is not neutral\r\nin the face of such a cowardly crime, and it will\r\ncontinue to support all the efforts of this Organization\r\nand the international community to put a definitive end\r\nto these crimes against humanity. We must not confine\r\nourselves exclusively to demonstrations of solidarity\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nand condemnation. We must make definite\r\ncommitments to the international consensus that has\r\nbeen built in order to face this grave threat to humanity.\r\nThis general debate is taking place in\r\ncircumstances that would have been unimaginable to us\r\nand that have reminded us of our vulnerability to\r\nindividuals and groups of individuals that commit\r\nindiscriminate violent acts that are totally unjustified in\r\nthe minds or feelings of civilized human beings. We\r\nmust also recall that the theme of international\r\nterrorism has been on our Organization’s agenda since\r\nthe twenty-seventh session of the General Assembly,\r\nand since then to date we have not been sufficiently\r\ndiligent in taking the legal and collective security\r\nmeasures necessary to prevent events such as those we\r\nare belatedly regretting\r\nThe urgent fight against terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations, which should not be interpreted as a\r\nclash of civilizations or of religious beliefs, is the top\r\npriority on our international agenda, and we cannot\r\nassert that any country is free of the danger posed by\r\ninternational terrorism. Rarely in history have there\r\nbeen such grave challenges to international peace and\r\nsecurity like the one we face today — a fact which\r\nforces us take clear and firm positions that are in\r\nkeeping with the provisions of the Charter and the\r\nprevailing norms of international law. Not only is\r\ninternational security at stake today, but so is the\r\ndemocratic system itself, which represents victory and\r\nuniversal good in its constant aspiration to and struggle\r\nfor freedom and justice.\r\nImmediately after these events, my Government\r\nstrengthened internal measures required by the\r\ncircumstances so as to be able to exercise greater\r\ncontrol and security over movements into and out of\r\nthe country, while respecting the principle of the free\r\nmovement of persons.\r\nMindful of its responsibility and consistent with\r\nthe commitment made as a Member of this\r\nOrganization, the Republic of Paraguay, by a decree of\r\nthe executive branch of 24 October 2001, established\r\nan inter-ministerial commission to implement\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), recently adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council. The Republic’s judicial and\r\nlegislative branches and the Attorney General’s office\r\nwere called on to designate various governmental\r\ndivision representatives. The commission was installed\r\non 6 November 2001, under the coordination of the\r\nMinistry for Foreign Relations.\r\nA draft law is also currently under consideration\r\nby the judicial branch, which defines and sets penalties\r\nfor the crime of terrorism, and it enjoys the full support\r\nof the executive branch.\r\nOn 12 October 2001, Paraguay signed the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, which is being referred to the\r\nNational Congress for adoption. The national\r\nGovernment has embarked on constitutional procedures\r\nso that the other conventions on this matter to which it\r\nis still not a party will be signed and ratified or adhered\r\nto as soon as possible.\r\nWe also expect the early adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of the two conventions on terrorism, which\r\nare under discussion in the Ad Hoc Committee created\r\nfor this purpose in the Sixth Committee. We must not\r\nwait for a replay of the events of 11 September in order\r\nto accelerate our strengthening of the international\r\nlegal framework. The time we delay in strengthening\r\nour legal framework will be an opportunity for the\r\nterrorists to increase their capacity and expand their\r\ncriminal activities to other countries.\r\nWithin the framework of the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS), we have participated with full\r\nconviction in deciding on actions and formulating\r\ndecisions that were recently adopted during the\r\nconsultative meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs.\r\nIn the context of our regional association — the\r\nCommon Market Southern Cone (MERCOSUR) — on\r\n28 September 2001, it was decided to undertake the\r\nbroadest possible cooperation among its members in\r\norder to carry out information exchange, studies,\r\nconcerted actions against terrorist acts and the\r\nestablishment of an open-ended working group to\r\nappraise and devise common policies in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nIn recent weeks we have experienced once again\r\na new terrorist threat, and I am referring particularly to\r\nthe use of biological agents, whose effects could reach\r\na planetary level and threaten humanity itself as a\r\nwhole. This new criminal practice compels us to react\r\nas rapidly and energetically as possible and be\r\ndetermined in all our efforts to uncover the perpetrators\r\nand their sponsors, who are acting in anonymity.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nInternational concern and actions generated by\r\nthe events of September must also prompt us to reflect\r\nand evaluate other themes of transcendental importance\r\non our agenda, such as the fight against poverty, the\r\nneed to strengthen international economic cooperation\r\nfor development, access to markets and information\r\nand communication technologies by the developing\r\ncountries so that the imbalances that still characterize\r\ninternational relations may become less severe.\r\nAchieving the goals set in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, along with other commitments entered\r\ninto in the context of development in the various\r\nforums of our Organization, must continue to be one of\r\nour greatest and urgent challenges in coming years.\r\nFor this reason, we fully concur with the point\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization that the most difficult battle\r\nfacing the international community is the eradication of\r\npoverty — which is exactly why we must speed up the\r\neconomic growth of the developing countries. We trust\r\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held next year in Monterrey,\r\nMexico, will achieve the desired results. To this end,\r\nwe believe that consideration must be given to the\r\nclear-cut differences among existing levels of\r\ndevelopment, to the unevenness that prevails in the\r\ncapacity of countries to participate in international\r\nprocesses and, in this regard, to the special situation of\r\nlandlocked countries, which, because of the nature of\r\ntheir territory, face greater difficulties in engaging in\r\nexternal trade, thus putting a brake on their economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is our hope that the final outcome of that\r\nConference will not be confined solely and exclusively\r\nto a mere political declaration or expression of wishes.\r\nWe hope that it will set clear objectives and goals to\r\nensure that the globalization process, rather than\r\nwidening the existing gap between rich and poor, will\r\npromote the development of all nations within an\r\ninclusive and equitable framework.\r\nGiven the new challenges and changes that have\r\narisen since the beginning of the new millennium, we\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the urgent need to\r\nstrengthen our Organization, underscoring first and\r\nforemost the central role that should be played by the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the most representative, universal\r\nand equitable deliberative organ. We should not allow\r\nthe General Assembly to become a mere meeting place\r\nwhere we participate in order to fulfil a routine\r\nfunction within a pre-established timetable of work.\r\nSpeeding up reform of the Security Council is\r\nanother of the key aspects in strengthening the United\r\nNations. The Council should become a more\r\ndemocratic, representative and transparent organ so\r\nthat it can strike a better political balance. This process\r\nshould provide for an increase in both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members, so as to secure a better level\r\nof participation for developing countries which, at the\r\npresent time, are under-represented. Likewise we\r\nbelieve that, in the area of transparency of the\r\nCouncil’s activities, it is appropriate to establish\r\ninteractive machinery involving the other Member\r\nStates of the Organization so that they will have greater\r\naccess to the Council’s work. For this reason, we have\r\nwelcomed the briefing meetings that the Chairman of\r\nthe Special Committee established pursuant to Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) is giving to other\r\nMembers of the Organization.\r\nAnother outstanding issue that needs to be\r\nresolved by our Organization, and one that gives us\r\nutmost concern in view of the recent increase in\r\nviolence and loss of life, is the situation in the Middle\r\nEast. We believe that both the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council should redouble their efforts to\r\narrive at a solution that will respond to the rightful\r\naspirations of the parties concerned. It should include\r\nrecognition of Israel’s existence within secure and\r\nwell-defined borders and the Palestinian people’s full\r\nenjoyment of the right to have its own homeland. We\r\nneed to tackle this issue firmly and resolutely, ensuring\r\nthat we work together with the necessary political will\r\nto contribute to international peace and security.\r\nMy country, Paraguay, also hopes that other areas\r\nof tension in the world may be settled. In this regard,\r\nmindful of the principle of universality enshrined in\r\nour Charter, we advocate a solution to the question of\r\nthe Republic of China and Taiwan within the\r\nframework of the norms of international law.\r\nThe current economic and social state of affairs,\r\nand its consequences, obliges us to mobilize efficiently,\r\nwith the greatest possible degree of responsibility and\r\nsolidarity, the cooperation required from the developed\r\ncountries and the international financial institutions to\r\ntackle the challenges that we, as leaders, face when we\r\ntry to create conditions of equal opportunity for paid\r\nemployment, and when we seek to eliminate income\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\ninequities that undermine social stability, and to\r\nprovide for basic care and services for our peoples and\r\nfor the sustainable development of our countries.\r\nIn conclusion, we are aware today, more than\r\never, of the need to begin a process that allows us to\r\nwork together in a rational way to build a more\r\nsupportive and participatory new economic world\r\norder, the ultimate purpose of which would be to\r\npromote development and well-being for all of our\r\npeoples, once and for all. In this regard, I wish to\r\nexpress my Government’s utter conviction that the\r\ncurrent international situation underscores the\r\nimportance of this process beginning and ending within\r\nthe sphere of the United Nations, thus ensuring full\r\nparticipation in it of all Member States.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Paraguay for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Luis Angel González Macchi, President of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President\r\nof the Republic of Uganda\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Uganda.\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the\r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Museveni: There is a lot of talk\r\nfloating around regarding some catchwords: the “new\r\ninternational order”, “globalization”, the “global\r\nvillage” and so forth. All of these ebullient, self-\r\ngratifying positions are, apparently, due to the end of\r\nthe cold war between the Western countries and the\r\nformer Soviet Union. Of course, the end of the\r\ndangerous and misguided rivalry between communism\r\nand capitalism is welcome and has, indeed, opened\r\nsome new opportunities, if fully utilized by all\r\nconcerned.\r\nHowever, it must be pointed out unequivocally\r\nthat many of the problems in the world today predate\r\nthe cold war; they predate the onset of communism in\r\nRussia in 1917. The slave trade started in the 1440s\r\nalong the West African coast. A shift from bleeding\r\nAfrica through slavery to resident colonialism was\r\nordained in Berlin in 1884. That was long before\r\ncommunism took over in Russia. Therefore the cold\r\nwar could not have been responsible for these mistakes\r\nand for the complications they created, many of which\r\nwe are still grappling with today, especially in Africa.\r\nTherefore, the euphoria that followed the end of\r\nthe cold war was not wholly justified. The song about\r\nglobalization, as I have pointed out repeatedly, is not a\r\nnew tune at all. Africans were globalized as slaves all\r\nover all over the world in the 1440s. My Christian\r\nname is Joel, actually a Jewish name, so I am already\r\nglobalized. Many of my countrymen have got Arab\r\nnames like Azizi and Musa because they are Muslims.\r\nWe were globalized long ago in Africa. Unfortunately,\r\nthough, that globalization movement was parasitic. It\r\nwas a parasitic globalization movement; it was not a\r\nsymbiotic globalization movement. Therefore the only\r\nnew question we can legitimately and usefully ask is:\r\nWill the new phase of globalization be less parasitic\r\nand more symbiotic, or not? That is the question. Will\r\nthe new globalization be to everybody’s mutual benefit,\r\nor will it be the old story of parasitism on a global\r\nscale?\r\nThe parasitism in the world is not the sole\r\nresponsibility of those who benefit from inequality.\r\nEven the victims have always contributed to their\r\nmarginalization by their own wrong aims and\r\nmethods — before colonization, during colonization\r\nand, even, after colonization. Myopic African chiefs\r\nwere the main facilitators of the slave trade. Until very\r\nrecently the Europeans did not possess the\r\ntechnological means to subdue the African continent as\r\nfar as means of transport — that is to say, railways —\r\nweapons or medicine were concerned. Without the\r\nfratricidal, brother-against-brother wars fomented by\r\nAfrican chiefs, neither the slave trade nor colonialism\r\nwould have been possible. We would have defeated the\r\ncolonialists and forced them, right from the beginning,\r\nto cooperate with us to everybody’s mutual benefit.\r\nWeakness on the side of the potential victim always\r\ntempts the aggressor. The aggressor is always\r\nencouraged by the weakness of the potential victim.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nEven today, however, the authorship of the\r\ninequality among peoples is still a joint responsibility\r\nof the victims — who in this case are Africans, Arabs\r\nand other marginalized peoples — of the parasitic\r\nglobalization movement that is now 500 years old, on\r\nthe one hand, and the beneficiaries of this hitherto\r\nunequal and, in the past, evil movement, on the other\r\nhand. Both the victims and the beneficiaries of the\r\nparasitic globalization movement are responsible for\r\nthis situation. The beneficiaries of the hitherto parasitic\r\nglobalization movement have been the North\r\nAmericans, the Europeans and the Japanese.\r\nFor a variety of reasons, some formerly colonized\r\npeoples — such as the Indians, Indonesians, Pakistanis,\r\nSouth-East Asians and Native Americans — and\r\nformerly semi-colonized peoples, such as the Chinese,\r\nhave made significant upward movements that are\r\nhelping, slowly but surely, to even out the balance of\r\npower in the world. Some other peoples, however, on\r\naccount of a number of endogenous and exogenous\r\nfactors, are still living as the wretched of the Earth.\r\nMany Africans and some Arabs fall into this category\r\nof the still-unredeemed of the Earth. As I have said, the\r\nunredeemed are so categorized partly on account of\r\ntheir own internal mistakes — such as sectarianism,\r\nxenophobia, unprincipled conflicts, the strangulation of\r\nfree enterprise, the political balkanization of their\r\nregions, the strangulation of political freedoms and so\r\non — and partly on account of still very unfavourable\r\nexogenous factors. The most unfavourable such factor\r\nis the lack of access by these countries to markets in\r\nNorth America, the European Union, Japan, China,\r\nIndia and Russia.\r\nThe song about aid is meaningless without access\r\nto markets. Aid without access to markets is\r\nmeaningless. All protectionism must end, especially in\r\nthe countries of the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation in Europe (OECD). Subsidies to the\r\nfarmers of Europe must end, if we are talking of a\r\nglobal village of symbiosis, and not parasitism. I\r\ncommend the American Government and President\r\nGeorge Bush for the recent African Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act (AGOA) initiative. Although Uganda\r\nhas not yet benefited from AGOA on account of our\r\nendogenous weaknesses, which have been accentuated\r\nby the blurred views of our partners in the multilateral\r\ninstitutions, other African countries have started\r\nbenefit, such as Kenya, Madagascar, Lesotho, Nigeria\r\nand South Africa. This is good. The African Growth\r\nand Opportunity Act enunciated by the American\r\nGovernment is the first good news I have heard in a\r\nlong time. The Americans are at last beginning to\r\nchange their image of being parasitic global villagers.\r\nThe Europeans must catch up with the Americans\r\nin shedding this uncomplimentary label. Although they\r\nhave talked about “everything but guns” going into\r\nEurope from Africa, they are still giving subsidies to\r\nartificial farmers in Europe. As a consequence of the\r\n$1.2 trillion value of global trade in agricultural\r\nproducts, Africa gets only about $20 billion — if the\r\nrecent results of the African Growth and Opportunity\r\nAct (AGOA) are included; that is about 2 per cent of\r\nthe total. So of the total value of agricultural trade,\r\nAfrica only gets 2 per cent. At the same time, the\r\ncountries of the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) are spending\r\n$361 billion on artificial subsidies for farmers of those\r\ncountries. Yet these are the countries that evangelize in\r\nthe name of free trade. The preachers of free trade are\r\npractising incredibly expensive protectionism. What an\r\nunfortunate paradox. These double standards must end.\r\nAfrica has removed some of the old impediments,\r\nsome of the old endogenous factors, to private\r\ninvestment. The sanctity of private property is now\r\nalmost a universal concept in Africa. Nationalization of\r\nprivate enterprises is no more. Some of the African\r\ncountries have a consistently stable macroeconomic\r\nframework. Inflation in Uganda is now negative 0.3 per\r\ncent. The African currencies are now convertible; a\r\nlarge part of Africa is very peaceful; infrastructure is\r\nreasonable; and democracy is widely practised in\r\nAfrica today. We are even addressing the issue of the\r\nexcessive political Balkanization of the continent,\r\nwhich has 53 States, compared to 3 States in the whole\r\nNorth American continent.\r\nWe are handling this in a variety of ways,\r\nincluding through economic blocs like the Southern\r\nAfrica Development Community in southern Africa,\r\nthe Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\r\nin East and Central Africa and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States in western Africa.\r\nThe world needs to encourage these positive trends in\r\nAfrica by opening up their markets on a quota-free,\r\ntariff-free basis. This will, ipso facto, force\r\nmultinational investors to rush to Africa and invest\r\nthere. They are already doing so just by the limited\r\nAGOA measures by the Americans. With more\r\ncivilized aims and methods, balanced world\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\ndevelopment is possible and desirable for everybody,\r\nincluding OECD citizens who are forced to eat inferior\r\nfoods and are taxed to protect those poor-quality foods\r\nagainst better foods from Africa.\r\nWhenever I travel abroad, I pack my own\r\nUgandan foods — milk, millet flour, fruits, legumes,\r\nchicken, honey and plantain bananas, called matooke in\r\nour language. The other day, on my way here, my\r\npineapple stocks ran out and my staff bought\r\npineapples from a supermarket in the United Kingdom.\r\nI took just one slice and terminated the whole exercise\r\nat once. First of all, the pineapple was hard. I had never\r\nseen a hard pineapple until I saw that one in London. It\r\nwas less sweet and had an ammonia-like pungent taste.\r\nI had had the same experience in Washington once.\r\nThey brought something they called a pineapple. I\r\ncould not believe it. Why must citizens of the world\r\nendure these deprivations on account of policies\r\ndesigned to serve narrow interests? Why must this be?\r\nI will not eat pineapple again until I go back to\r\nUganda.\r\nThe oppressors, the colonialists and those who\r\nsought to control the destiny of others used barbaric\r\nmethods: genocide, forced labour, ethnocide and so on.\r\nIt is amazing, therefore, that some of those who claim\r\nto be fighting for the liberation of oppressed peoples\r\nalso use barbaric means such as terrorism. In the\r\nongoing debate on terrorism I have not heard anybody\r\nbothering to define the difference between a freedom\r\nfighter and a terrorist. What is the difference between a\r\nfreedom fighter and a terrorist? Mzee Nelson\r\nMandela — “Mzee” means someone who is dignified\r\nand elderly — was a freedom fighter until recently.\r\nWas he a terrorist? Not at all. Did anyone hear that Mr.\r\nMandela had hijacked a plane or planted a bomb in a\r\nrestaurant? But Mr. Mandela was a freedom fighter. He\r\nwas not a terrorist. The difference between a terrorist\r\nand a freedom fighter lies in the fact that while a\r\nfreedom fighter sometimes may be forced to use\r\nviolence, he cannot use indiscriminate violence. The\r\nperson who uses indiscriminate violence is a terrorist.\r\nA freedom fighter may sometimes be forced to use\r\nviolence.\r\nI was forced to use violence against Idi Amin.\r\nBut I never hijacked a plane. It was never heard that\r\nMuseveni hijacked a plane or planted a bomb in a bar.\r\nPeople in bars are not politicians. Some of them just go\r\nthere to make merry. What kind of revolutionary is\r\nsomeone who kills such people? The person who uses\r\nindiscriminate violence is a terrorist. A terrorist does\r\nnot differentiate between combatants and non-\r\ncombatants, between civilians and servicemen and\r\nbetween armed servicemen and unarmed servicemen.\r\nEven if someone is a soldier, if he is off duty, he should\r\nnot be attacked, if one claims to be a freedom fighter.\r\nHe should not be attacked. It is against the laws of war.\r\nThe terrorist fights a war without declaring one. That is\r\nwhy terrorists hijack planes, plant bombs in populated\r\ncentres and so forth.\r\nWe normally get technical advice from other parts\r\nof the world. The Europeans always come to give us\r\ntechnical advice. I would like to give you technical\r\nadvice about freedom-fighting. We have done very well\r\nin that. In Africa, since 1961, we have fought wars of\r\nliberation in Mozambique against the Portuguese; in\r\nAngola against the Portuguese; in Guinea-Bissau\r\nagainst the Portuguese; in Zimbabwe against minority\r\nwhites; in South Africa against minority whites; in\r\nNamibia against minority whites; and in Uganda\r\nagainst Idi Amin. There was a criminal called Idi Amin\r\nwhom we had to fight. However, we never used\r\nterrorism. This is on the record. We always fought\r\ncombatant to combatant. Quite a number of times our\r\ncomrades used mass action: strikes, demonstrations,\r\npetitions, diplomatic struggle and so on. Not a single\r\nplane was hijacked by African freedom fighters,\r\nalthough there were anti-colonial wars in all these\r\ncountries.\r\nTerrorist actions are misguided and criminal and\r\nmust be opposed by all as a matter of principle. Africa\r\nwas beginning to benefit from AGOA, the measure\r\ntaken by the Americans to open their markets to our\r\ngoods. Business has, however, now somewhat slumped\r\nin America. Therefore, the terrorists, who claim to be\r\nfighting for the Palestinian cause, are objectively\r\nhurting the interests of Africans, who have always been\r\nthe allies of the Palestinians. This is counter-\r\nproductive. The terrorists have also tried to polarize the\r\nworld, pitting Moslems against Christians. This is\r\nerroneous and unacceptable. Exploitation knows no\r\nboundaries and cuts across all races and religions.\r\nExploiters are found in all religions and races. The\r\nArabs had to oppose Turkish imperialism. Yet both the\r\nArabs and the Turks were Muslims. Why, then, did\r\nthey have to oppose each other? One of the monsters of\r\nthe last century, Idi Amin, of my country, was a\r\nMuslim. We had to get rid of him to liberate everybody,\r\nincluding the Muslims, in Uganda. War has been going\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\non in the Sudan for decades. Elements that claim to be\r\nacting in the name of Islam have been the ones taking\r\nthe wrong position in this conflict, seeking hegemony\r\nover God’s people.\r\nI, therefore, support the position of the United\r\nStates on this occasion, as we did in the Gulf War, in\r\nfighting and defeating these reactionaries, who profane\r\nthe name of freedom fighters. If necessary, all countries\r\nof the world opposed to terrorism should contribute\r\ntroops and finish the job quickly. The coalition against\r\nterrorism should be regarded in the same way as the\r\ncoalition against fascism in the 1930s and 1940s.\r\nNevertheless, the just aspirations of the\r\nPalestinian people and of other oppressed peoples, like\r\nthe people of southern Sudan, must be supported so\r\nthat we can get peaceful resolutions to these conflicts. I\r\nwelcome freedom and equality for all peoples of the\r\nworld. Those who strive to dominate or exploit others\r\nhave illegitimate ambitions. We now have a chance to\r\nbuild a new, just world. The free will of all peoples\r\nshould be ensured. In addition, the most important\r\ninstrument of emancipation, free trade, should give\r\nAfrican goods quota- and tariff-free access to the\r\nmarkets of the countries of the Organization for\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) and vice versa.\r\nAfrica is beginning to tame its conflicts. The\r\nconflict in Lesotho was resolved by an African\r\nmechanism. Recently, the Arusha Agreement on Peace\r\nand Reconciliation ended the conflict in Burundi. It is\r\npossible to resolve our age-old problems and finally\r\nbecome part of the new world order rather than mere\r\nspectators of the process.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Uganda for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Museveni, President of the Republic of\r\nUganda, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Major-General Joseph Kabila, President\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo.\r\nMajor-General Joseph Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Major-General Joseph Kabila,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nand invite him to address Assembly.\r\nMajor-General Kabila (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme, at the outset, to add my voice to those of the\r\ndistinguished speakers before me, to offer you, Sir, on\r\nbehalf of the people of the Congo and myself, our\r\nwarmest congratulations on your election as President\r\nof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. The\r\nRepublic of Korea, your country, maintains excellent\r\nrelations with mine.\r\nMay I also use this opportunity to offer our most\r\nheartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, a\r\ndistinguished son of Africa, on his re-election to the\r\npost of Secretary-General and on the Nobel Prize,\r\nwhich has been awarded to him in recognition of his\r\ncommitment to the cause of promoting peace in the\r\nworld.\r\nThe people of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, its Government and I condemn unreservedly\r\nthe blind acts of terrorism that plunged the United\r\nStates and all of humanity into grief on 11 September\r\n2001. These were acts of gratuitous violence, which\r\ndeserve only the contempt of the whole international\r\ncommunity and of all nations that hold peace and\r\njustice dear.\r\nBy applying and implementing Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), my Government is committed\r\nto fully cooperate in advancing all initiatives aimed at\r\neliminating terrorism in all its forms.\r\nThe Congolese people, which is itself the\r\ninnocent victim of a war of aggression by Rwanda,\r\nUganda and Burundi — another kind of terrorism\r\ncharacterized by acts of barbarism that directly or\r\nindirectly brought about the death of millions of\r\nCongolese — had no trouble grasping the heinous\r\nnature the sad events that took place in the United\r\nStates of America on 11 September 2001.\r\nIt would be tiresome to go back over the origin\r\nand consequences of the war of aggression that started\r\non 2 August 1998, in flagrant violation of the Charters\r\nof the United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU). Thus, following the logic of peace and\r\nwell aware that only non-violent settlements bring\r\nlasting peace, I can but welcome the many peace\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\ninitiatives that have sought to bring about negotiated\r\nsolutions to the conflicts.\r\nI have particularly in mind President Chiluba of\r\nZambia, the appointed mediator of the Lusaka peace\r\nprocess for the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nI would also like to mention the Southern Africa\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), and in particular\r\nAngola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which, in accordance\r\nwith the SADC charter, rallied around my country\r\nwhen it was attacked.\r\nI would also like to address my thanks and\r\ngratitude to the United Nations and the United Nations\r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo (MONUC), whose arduous work on the\r\nground has been very praiseworthy, and to the OAU,\r\nthe European Union and certain other traditional\r\npartners of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe situation on the ground has improved in spite\r\nof the bad faith displayed by some of the parties to the\r\nLusaka Agreement. The disengagement of forces is in\r\nits final stages, and the effective end to hostilities\r\nwhich it has brought has been observed to the\r\nsatisfaction of all. However, the return of armed\r\ntension has been seen in the eastern part of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in the part of the\r\ncountry that is occupied by Rwanda. These hostilities\r\nhave been wrongly described as fighting that has\r\nmoved to the rear of the Rwandan forces. In fact, what\r\nwe see is the logical consequence of the failure of a\r\nnew plan by the Rwandan aggressors, who hoped to\r\nsweep away all Congolese resistance, the better to\r\noccupy the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo in order to be able to continue to pillage our\r\nwealth unchallenged.\r\nAs far as the disarmament of the armed groups is\r\nconcerned, we should note that a disarmament,\r\ndemobilization, repatriation, resettlement and\r\nreintegration (DDRRR) programme, drafted by\r\nMONUC and the Joint Military Commission (JMC),\r\nwas adopted by the Political Committee set up under\r\nthe Lusaka Agreement. It provides, first of all, for the\r\nvoluntary disarmament of all the armed groups in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. In this respect, the\r\nCongolese Government, reaffirming its good faith and\r\nits commitment to this plan, has regrouped and\r\nconfined 3,000 Rwandan combatants in Kamina in\r\nKatanga province, and a MONUC mission has been\r\nthere for several days now in order to identify these\r\nparticular individuals.\r\nAs far as the withdrawal of foreign forces is\r\nconcerned, the definitive and total departure of all\r\nNamibian forces has been noted. This movement of\r\nforeign forces back to their countries is continuing;\r\nnow the Zimbabwean, Angolan and Ugandan military\r\nare beginning their withdrawal. Paradoxically,\r\nhowever, and despite the continuing demands by the\r\ninternational community through all of the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, Rwanda is actually\r\nreinforcing its military presence in the Congo.\r\nThe process of reconciliation, so long awaited\r\nthrough national dialogue, made significant advances\r\nduring the preparatory meetings from 20-24 August\r\n2001 in Gaborone, thanks to the Republican pact\r\ninitiated by the Government of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate solemnly from this rostrum the\r\nfull commitment of my Government to participate fully\r\nin the sessions on this dialogue to be held in the\r\nRepublic of South Africa. I invite the facilitator to do\r\neverything possible to deal with pending issues in order\r\nto make sure that the forum regains its inclusive\r\ncharacter, as provided for by the Lusaka Agreement\r\nand the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nFor the Government of the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, it is important that representatives of all\r\nsectors of our population should be able to participate\r\nin this dialogue so as to lay the foundations of a\r\ndemocratic State. I would invite the international\r\ncommunity, at the appropriate time, to assist my\r\ncountry in organizing free, democratic and transparent\r\nelections, which would allow the Congolese people to\r\nchoose their own leaders, leaders who will have the\r\nlegitimacy that a popular election provides and which,\r\nin turn, guarantees political stability.\r\nI would like to avail myself of this opportunity to\r\ninvite the United Nations to institute exemplary\r\nsanctions against all those States, their accessories and\r\naccomplices that are pillaging the wealth of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nI could not conclude my statement without\r\nthanking the Security Council members for having\r\nunanimously adopted resolution 1376 (2001) on 9\r\nNovember, which condemns the establishment of a\r\njoint force set up by the Congolese rebels, instigated by\r\nRwanda in violation of the Lusaka Agreement, in\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nviolation of the DDRRR plan and of all relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. This resolution is\r\nparticularly welcome for its providing for the\r\ndeployment of MONUC’s phase III. It also provides for\r\nthe demilitarization of the city of Kisangani, the\r\nneutrality of Kindu and the reconstruction of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nIn my statement, I have condemned the infamous\r\nacts perpetrated against the people of the United States\r\nand of the world as a whole. I have also spoken of the\r\ncatastrophic situation in my country, which has been\r\nvictim of a war of aggression for the past three years. I\r\nhave also noted the significant advances achieved in\r\nthe peace process in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, which unfortunately risks being compromised\r\nthrough the bad faith of Rwanda and its Congolese\r\nrebel accomplices.\r\nI have stressed how essential the support of the\r\ninternational community is if we are to achieve this\r\nprocess successfully and to launch the reconstruction\r\nof my country. The Congolese people, who have\r\nsuffered so much, are asking only one thing of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community: that\r\njustice be done for the weak and the strong, for rich\r\nand poor alike.\r\nMajor-General Joseph Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius.\r\nThe Right Honourable Anerood Jugnauth, Prime\r\nMinister of Mauritius, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: I have the great pleasure to\r\nwelcome to the United Nations The Right Honourable\r\nAnerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Jugnauth (Mauritius): Mr. President, it gives\r\nme great pleasure to address this Assembly under your\r\nable and distinguished leadership. May I, on behalf of\r\nmy delegation, take this opportunity to extend to you\r\nour warmest congratulations on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. You may rest assured, Sir, of the fullest\r\nsupport and co-operation of my delegation in the\r\ndaunting tasks that you will be called upon to confront\r\nduring your tenure.\r\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to thank\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri for the excellent manner in which he\r\nsteered the work of the last session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMay I also congratulate a distinguished son of\r\nAfrica, our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\nunopposed election to a second term. The award of the\r\nNobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nations\r\nconfirms the high esteem in which he and our\r\nOrganization are held.\r\nAs we gather in New York, the atrocities of 11\r\nSeptember remain fresh in our collective memory.\r\nAllow me to pay a special tribute to the memory of the\r\nthousands of innocent victims of the terrorist attacks on\r\nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon and in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\nWe condemn the attempts of the terrorists to\r\njustify their acts as being in conformity with the tenets\r\nof Islam. We do so because neither Islam nor any other\r\nreligion condones the killing of innocent civilians.\r\nIn order to preserve the lives of our citizens and\r\ntheir way of life, we are bound to focus on the sequels\r\nof those heinous terrorist attacks.\r\nInternational terrorism must be fought with all the\r\nmeans at our disposal. Terrorists know only one thing,\r\nand that is destruction. While Mauritius is fully\r\ncommitted to the global coalition against terrorism, we\r\nurge the international community to take a long-term\r\nview of international terrorism. Terrorism is the\r\ngreatest threat to international peace, security and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe also believe that the war on terrorism must be\r\nfought on the basis of principles and standards which\r\nare accepted by every single State. Terrorism remains\r\nterrorism, and there can be no justification for it at any\r\ntime or under any circumstances. We also consider that\r\ncross-border terrorism has caused and is continuing to\r\ncause immeasurable damage in many parts of the\r\nIndian subcontinent and in Africa. We are convinced\r\nthat there must be no double or multiple standards in\r\nthe war against terrorism. In this context, we believe\r\nthat the International Criminal Court must become\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\noperational at the earliest date, and countries which\r\nrejected it in the past must review their stand.\r\nWe shall work closely with the Security Council\r\nand the international community at large in order to\r\nfully implement Security Council resolutions 1368\r\n(2001) and 1373 (2001).\r\nTogether with the war on terrorism, we need to\r\nwage many other wars, particularly in the light of the\r\nMillennium Declaration adopted last year. We need to\r\npursue wars against poverty, ignorance, hunger and\r\nunderdevelopment. The war against the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS is a war that we cannot afford to lose. It is\r\nour belief that the international community must\r\nremain focused on these issues, as they are very often\r\nthe breeding ground for dissent, crises, wars and\r\nterrorism.\r\nPeace and security will be in danger as long as\r\nnuclear arsenals and weapons of mass destruction\r\ncontinue to exist and proliferate. Now that terrorists\r\nmay get hold of or may already have in their\r\npossession such weapons, it becomes extremely urgent\r\nfor the nuclear States to start meaningful discussions\r\non the elimination of these weapons within a specified\r\ntime frame.\r\nWith the conclusion of the recent United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects, we need to move\r\ntowards early implementation of the measures\r\ncontained in its Programme of Action. For Africa, this\r\nis a top priority. We are convinced that disarmament\r\ncannot remain a slogan; it must be effectively\r\naddressed.\r\nConflicts, wars and crises still persist in many\r\nparts of the African continent and elsewhere,\r\nparticularly in the Balkans. Although we are\r\nencouraged by the latest developments in Burundi and\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and by the\r\ndirect talks between Rwanda and Uganda to defuse\r\nsituations before they become explosive, we consider\r\nthat peace and security in Africa deserve the closer\r\ninvolvement of the international community,\r\nparticularly in making available adequate financial\r\nresources. We expect early and full deployment of the\r\nthird phase of the United Nations Organization Mission\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) in\r\nkeeping with the Security Council resolutions, and we\r\nsupport the inter-Congolese dialogue.\r\nWe are grateful to African leaders like former\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela, President Moi and former\r\nPresident Masire for their commitment to ridding\r\nAfrica of conflicts and to paving the way for an\r\nAfrican economic take-off.\r\nMauritius is committed to a major reform of the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council. We are convinced\r\nthat we should amend the Charter in a way that would\r\nreflect the emergence of new power structures\r\njustifying an expansion of the membership. Whatever\r\nmay be the criteria for an expanded membership, we\r\nbelieve that India ought to become a permanent\r\nmember at the earliest opportunity. The expansion of\r\nthe Security Council, as well as a reassessment of the\r\nabsolutist veto, cannot be delayed any longer.\r\nThe birth of the African Union coincides with its\r\nrole as the engine to drive forward the process of the\r\nNew Partnership for African Development (NEPAD).\r\nThe New Partnership for African Development is a\r\nroad map for Africa to eradicate poverty and to achieve\r\nthe sustainable growth and development of the\r\ncontinent, thereby allowing it to find its place in the\r\nworld economy. It is a call for a new relationship\r\nbetween Africa and its partners.\r\nWe are mindful of the setback which the events of\r\n11 September have caused to the major economies, but\r\nwe are also hopeful that the G-8 will remain committed\r\nto providing to Africa all assistance for the effective\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nMauritius supports the liberalization of\r\ninternational trade under the rules of the World Trade\r\nOrganization. We are, however, disappointed at the\r\nlack of progress with regard to implementation issues\r\nand the undertakings of the major trading countries\r\nunder previous Uruguay Round agreements. The terms\r\nof trade as well as non-trade concerns are tilted too\r\nmuch in favour of the developed countries, which are\r\nstill denying market access. Africa, which today\r\naccounts for less than two per cent of global trade,\r\ncould, with the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers\r\nin the developed countries, significantly increase its\r\nshare of global trade and thus improve the standard of\r\nliving of its people. An increase in trade for Africa will\r\nalso mean a lesser dependence on aid.\r\nWhile globalization throws up opportunities as\r\nwell as challenges, we also have to be conscious of its\r\nnegative aspects. We appeal for there to be no double\r\ndealing in trade with poor countries.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nThe Small Island Developing States experience a\r\nvariety of inherent disadvantages. In their efforts to\r\nachieve sustainable development and the need to\r\nenhance their capabilities to function effectively within\r\nthe new globalized trading arrangements, my\r\ndelegation calls for the urgent and effective\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action for\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates.\r\nWe welcome the statement by the United States\r\nthat it supports the creation of a Palestinian State. We\r\nconsider this to be a major step in the right direction\r\nfor the resolution of the Middle East crisis. We urge the\r\nUnited States to be even-handed in its relations with\r\nboth Israel and the Palestinian Authority. We also\r\nbelieve that the unilateral imposition of conditions\r\nprior to the resumption of peace talks is unhelpful.\r\nWith the support of the international community, we\r\nare confident that Israel and Palestine can, within the\r\nframework of the Mitchell report and the Tenet plan,\r\nwork out a just and durable peace in which the States\r\nof Israel and Palestine can live side by side, secure\r\nwithin their respective boundaries.\r\nIn our region, the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity  and the Common Market for Eastern and\r\nSouthern Africa (COMESA) are emerging as important\r\ninstitutions integrating our economies. These initiatives\r\nare helping the member States to better confront the\r\nchallenges of globalization. COMESA is the first\r\nregional institution to have set up a free trade area.\r\nThese regional institutions also address issues of good\r\ngovernance, as well as security and peace. We take an\r\ninterest in the domestic situation of our fellow\r\nmembers inasmuch as whatever happens in one\r\nmember State inevitably impacts, negatively or\r\notherwise, on all member States.\r\nWe urge all parties to the Framework Agreement\r\nfor National Reconciliation to take all measures to\r\nexpedite the process towards the referendum in the\r\nComoros that will usher in a new constitution. Under\r\nthe aegis of the African Union, Mauritius is proposing\r\nto host a donors’ meeting as soon as the Framework\r\nAgreement is implemented.\r\nWe continue to claim our sovereignty over the\r\nChagos archipelago, which was excised by the United\r\nKingdom from the then colony of Mauritius in\r\nviolation of international law and of General Assembly\r\nresolution 1514 (XV). We are convinced that the time\r\nfor the United Kingdom to engage in talks for the early\r\nretrocession of the archipelago to Mauritian\r\nsovereignty is long overdue, inasmuch as problems left\r\nover from colonial days cannot remain unresolved.\r\nWe are also concerned by the plight of all those\r\nMauritians, commonly known as the Ilois, who were\r\nforcibly and in outright violation of their fundamental\r\nrights removed from the islands forming the\r\narchipelago by the then colonial Power. We support\r\ntheir legitimate claim for all appropriate remedies.\r\nWith regard to Tromelin, I reiterate the position\r\nof my delegation, as expressed in the General\r\nAssembly last year, and once again call on the French\r\nGovernment to enter into constructive negotiations for\r\nthe settlement of this issue.\r\nAs I speak here, bombs are still falling over\r\nAfghanistan. We are aware that the living conditions of\r\nthe civilian population are difficult. We deplore the\r\nloss of civilian lives. We are confident, however, that\r\nthe international community will rise to the occasion in\r\nproviding all humanitarian assistance to the needy in\r\nAfghanistan. We are hopeful that the efforts under way\r\nto install a broad-based Government in Afghanistan\r\nwill be successful.\r\nThe Conference of Parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in\r\nMorocco, the World Food Summit in Rome, the\r\ndiscussions on trade issues in Doha and a host of other\r\nmeetings in recent days demonstrate the close\r\ndependence that we have on each other. No country can\r\nafford to go it alone and the many problems that we\r\nface today must be faced by us all in a spirit of\r\nsolidarity, cooperation and mutual accommodation. We\r\nneed to be continually engaged and to collaborate so\r\nthat never again does humanity live the extremely\r\npainful moments that it lived after 11 September.\r\nThe United Nations is the forum to address all\r\nour concerns and we are sure that all countries,\r\nregardless of their might, understand that there can be\r\nno substitute for the rule of law, good governance,\r\ndemocracy and respect for the dignity and rights of the\r\nindividual. We do recognize the threats posed by\r\ninternational terrorism and we are all prepared to do\r\nwhatever has to be done to combat it. It is our hope that\r\nthis togetherness will not be frittered away when the\r\nthreat and the danger have disappeared. The world has\r\nwalked away on too many occasions in the past. From\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nnow on, we have to walk together and pave the way for\r\na better world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I thank the Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Mauritius for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Right Honourable Anerood Jugnauth, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Mauritius, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Zlatko Lagumdzija, Prime Minister\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nMr. Zlatko Lagumdzija, Prime Minister of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming Mr. Zlatko Lagumdzija, Prime Minister of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Lagumdzija (Bosnia and Herzegovina): I am\r\ngrateful for the opportunity to address the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. I would like to\r\nextend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your\r\nwell-deserved election.\r\nI would like to join those who spoke before me in\r\nexpressing my deep condolences to the people of the\r\nUnited States. The date of 11 September will be forever\r\ninscribed in our minds and hearts as the symbol of the\r\nmost blatant affront to civilization and commonly\r\naccepted values. Regardless of the brutality of the\r\nterrorist attacks directed against innocent civilians,\r\nhowever, they failed in the attempt to polarize the\r\nworld and to undermine the very foundations of our\r\nsocieties. Those attacks were attacks against all of us,\r\ntoo. We therefore fully support the approach outlined\r\nyesterday morning by President Bush.\r\nYes, the fight against all kinds of terrorism must\r\nbe determined and precise. It has to target terrorists,\r\nwho must be apprehended and brought to justice. At\r\nthe same time, we have to do much more when we are\r\ntalking about quick and massive help to the innocent\r\ncivilians of Afghanistan.\r\nI would like to use this opportunity to recall that\r\nmy country promptly and resolutely joined the\r\nworldwide coalition against terrorism. And I am\r\nconvinced that, by adopting such a clear position, my\r\ncountry is a part of the solution, rather than a part of\r\nthe problem, in this particular field. I spoke about this\r\nmore extensively in this same Hall two days ago on the\r\noccasion of the meeting devoted to the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations.\r\nComing from Bosnia and Herzegovina, which\r\nwas treated by various kinds of fundamentalists and\r\nradicals as a problematic and questionable Balkan\r\ncountry because of its multi-ethnic and multicultural\r\nnature, I am especially sensitive to the type of\r\nterrorism that misuses religious feelings and, in so\r\ndoing, jeopardizes local societies and global society.\r\nThe war against terrorists is justified, but all of us\r\nwill be losers if we fail to do everything we can to help\r\nthe innocent people who are suffering today. Our\r\nexperience in Bosnia and Herzegovina teaches us that\r\nmilitary intervention, even when complemented by\r\nhumanitarian assistance, is not enough for a\r\nsustainable, long-lasting solution.\r\nAt the same time, we — and when I say “we”, I\r\nmean the international community speaking with one\r\nvoice, together with local democratic forces, regardless\r\nof their current strength — have to have a clear vision\r\nof a political solution, accompanied by a programme\r\nfor social and economic development, once the military\r\nintervention is over. Only such a comprehensive\r\napproach — military, humanitarian, political and socio-\r\neconomic — will leave no room for the terrorists to\r\ninterpret the intervention in Afghanistan as a war\r\nagainst Islam or as a symbol of the clash of\r\ncivilizations.\r\nThe terrorists will lose. Without a comprehensive\r\napproach, we might be losers, too, by the measure of\r\nethical and universal human values. That is why we\r\nhave to tackle these areas of future action together,\r\nstarting today.\r\nAt a time when humanity has reached for the\r\nhighest objectives but also carried out the worst deeds,\r\nthere should be no doubt that the United Nations can\r\nfulfil its new tasks, confronting old and new\r\nchallenges, leading in the building of a prosperous\r\nworld founded no longer on force but on the rule of\r\nlaw, not on a balance of power but on a balance of\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe contribution of the international community\r\nin achieving progress in my country, Bosnia and\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nHerzegovina, was particularly visible in the role of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nthe Stabilization Force, the United Nations High\r\nRepresentative, the Peace Implementation Council, the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nand other members of the family of the international\r\ncommunity present in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe particularly recognize and value the role of\r\nthe United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nin police reform and the substantial upgrading of the\r\njudicial system. The United Nations family of\r\norganizations was certainly one of the key players in\r\nthe development of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a\r\nmultiethnic, tolerant and democratic State.\r\nKnowing that the mandate of the United Nations\r\nMission in the present form will terminate by the end\r\nof 2002, we expect the United Nations mission\r\nactivities to continue in a different form. However, we\r\nwould like to see a smooth transition without any\r\ninterruption in these extremely important activities.\r\nThe noble goals and accomplishments of our\r\nOrganization were honoured recently, and I would like\r\nto extend sincere and heartiest congratulations to the\r\nSecretary-General and the whole of the United Nations\r\nfor the recognition by the Nobel Peace Prize\r\nCommittee.\r\nI would like to inform the Assembly that we have\r\ndecided to present candidature of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina for a non-permanent seat in the Security\r\nCouncil for the year 2010. We are convinced that by\r\ndoing so, we confirm our commitment to contributing\r\nfully to the work of the United Nations. It would also\r\nbe a clear sign of advanced stability and normalization\r\nof life in our country, and particularly of our\r\ncommitment to economic and democratic development.\r\nTherefore, we hope that as early as in 10 years from\r\nnow, Bosnia and Herzegovina will succeed in\r\nbecoming a member of the most important political\r\nbody of the United Nations.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are working daily\r\nto live up to the vision of a safer and more peaceful,\r\nstable and self-sustaining country. Our efforts are\r\ndirected toward three main sets of priorities.\r\nFirst is the rule of law, through the speedy\r\nimplementation of the latest Constitutional Court\r\ndecisions and through proper judiciary and police\r\nactions fighting terrorism and organized crime,\r\ncombating corruption, arresting indicted war criminals\r\nand creating a stable environment for the return of\r\nrefugees.\r\nSecond are the further building and strengthening\r\nof the State’s institutions.\r\nThird are economic reforms directed to the\r\nstrengthening of economic activities; establishment of\r\na single economic space; and setting up the conditions\r\nfor upgraded education, thus offering a choice for our\r\nyoung generations to stay in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nand become an inseparable factor in its development\r\nand future.\r\nOf course, implementation of the Dayton/Paris\r\nPeace Agreement and the continuous adjustment and\r\nupgrading of our legal framework according to\r\nEuropean standards are the foundation of activities of\r\nthe authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels.\r\nOnce again, I would like to express the gratitude\r\nof my Government to the international community for\r\nits devoted support of the enduring stability and\r\ndevelopment of my country. We are determined to\r\nmove from the position of a patient or passive recipient\r\nof aid from international organizations and institutions\r\nto one of a partner in and contributor to international\r\nefforts. We have to go through the process of being\r\nfirst a recipient and then a partner in order to finally\r\nbecome the owner of the changes in our country.\r\nWe are aware that responsibility for healing the\r\nconsequences of the war and post-war stagnation, and\r\nfor the removal of impediments to faster stabilization\r\nand progress, rest primarily with the political\r\nleadership in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The future of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is in its integration into\r\nEuropean and North Atlantic organizations. The\r\nestablishment of contractual relations with the\r\nEuropean Union through the stabilization and\r\nassociation process is one of the priority strategic goals\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina. Further improvement of\r\ngood relations with neighbouring countries and\r\nincreased regional cooperation remain key elements for\r\nthe stability and development of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the region.\r\nRelations with the Republic of Croatia since the\r\ndemocratic changes in January last year are improving\r\nevery day, in every sense.\r\nAs a result of the democratic changes last year in\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nHerzegovina has established full diplomatic relations\r\nwith that country, which opened the official channels of\r\nthe two countries to deal with a number of important\r\nmatters.\r\nHowever, a number of issues that burdened\r\nrelations between the neighbouring countries are still\r\non the agenda. Some of them have already been solved\r\nin bilateral meetings, but we are looking forward to\r\ntackling them more actively.\r\nToday is exactly one year since the people of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, for the first time in 10 years\r\nof being driven by nationalism, gave less than 50\r\npercent of their votes to three major ethnic parties. It\r\ntook us almost four months to establish the new,\r\ndemocratic, multi-ethnic, Europe-oriented Government\r\nthat is now in place. We believe that we are on the way\r\nto striking a proper balance between the necessary\r\nassistance of the international community and further\r\ndecision-making by ourselves.\r\nFinally, I can assure you today that our country\r\nhas a leadership with a clear vision and is ready to act\r\naccordingly. For years, Bosnia and Herzegovina was\r\none of the world’s international and regional problems.\r\nToday, my country is becoming one of the solutions.\r\nWith this conviction, we are looking at the important\r\nchallenges and tremendous tasks that are still ahead of\r\nus. We must confront them without delay. I am\r\nstanding here to say we will do it.\r\nMr. Tang Jiaxuan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nMr. President, first of all, please allow me to warmly\r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. I am confident that under your able\r\nguidance and with the close cooperation of all\r\ndelegates, this session will be crowned with success. I\r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to express my\r\nsincere thanks to Mr. Holkeri for what he did as\r\nPresident of the last session of the General Assembly.\r\nA year ago, the United Nations convened the\r\nhistoric Millennium Summit. The United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration issued by the Summit\r\nidentifies the objectives for promoting world peace and\r\ndevelopment in the new century.\r\nInternational developments over the past year\r\ndemonstrate that more and more countries have opted\r\nfor increasing dialogue and cooperation, preserving\r\nworld peace and seeking common development. To be\r\nsure, the cause of human progress still involves a long\r\nand arduous effort. Factors of uncertainty in the\r\ninternational situation are on the rise. More efforts\r\nshould be made to democratize international relations,\r\nand there has been no marked change in the irrational\r\ninternational economic order.\r\nTerrorism is a widespread scourge that threatens\r\nworld peace and stability. We strongly condemn the\r\nterrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September,\r\nand extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to\r\nthe families of the innocent victims, as well as to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States. China\r\nhas always opposed all forms of terrorism. No matter\r\nwhen, where or in what form terrorism strikes, and no\r\nmatter whom it is directed against, it should be met\r\nwith condemnation and responded to with counter-\r\nstrikes by the international community, which should\r\nadopt a unified position on the matter.\r\nChina has taken an active part in international\r\ncooperation against terrorism. In addition to joining\r\nmost of the international conventions against terrorism,\r\nChina has ratified the Shanghai Convention on\r\nCombating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism,\r\nconcluded by the member States of the Shanghai\r\nCooperation Organization.\r\nChina is in favour of a primary role for the United\r\nNations and the Security Council in the international\r\neffort against terrorism. China supports the relevant\r\nresolutions that have been adopted and is in favour of\r\ncloser cooperation and coordination among the various\r\ncountries concerned to this end.\r\nChina strongly believes that any military action\r\nagainst terrorism should have a clearly defined target\r\nand avoid harming innocent people. All such actions\r\nshould be consistent with the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and other\r\nuniversally recognized norms of international law, and\r\nshould serve the long-term interests of peace in the\r\nregion and the world at large.\r\nChina believes that terrorism is a tiny fringe of\r\nextreme evil, representing neither one particular ethnic\r\ngroup nor one particular religion. They must not,\r\ntherefore, be lumped together. China, too, is threatened\r\nby terrorism. The “Eastern Turkestan” terrorist forces\r\nare trained, equipped and financed by international\r\nterrorist organizations. The fight against the “Eastern\r\nTurkestan” group is an important aspect of the\r\ninternational fight against terrorism.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nIn today’s world, the question of security is\r\nbecoming increasingly multifaceted and globalized.\r\nOnly enhanced international cooperation can help us\r\neffectively cope with global security challenges and\r\nbring about universal and lasting security. Countries\r\nshould endeavour to foster a new security concept,\r\nbased on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and\r\ncollaboration. They should seek security through\r\nmutual trust and pursue cooperation to their mutual\r\nbenefit so as to effectively reduce factors of insecurity.\r\nThe issue of arms control has always been closely\r\ninterrelated with that of security. In the face of the new\r\nsituation, we should go on working for the preservation\r\nof the existing legal regime for international arms\r\ncontrol and disarmament and for the maintenance of\r\nglobal strategic stability, without jeopardizing the\r\nsecurity of any country.\r\nTackling regional hot spots is vital to regional\r\nand global security. We are following with deep\r\nconcern the current developments in the Middle East.\r\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict that broke out in\r\nSeptember last year is continuing unabated. It poses a\r\ngrave threat to the Middle East peace process and to\r\nregional stability. China supports the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions and the principle of land for peace.\r\nIt also supports the Palestinian people in their just\r\nstruggle to regain their legitimate national rights and\r\ninterests. We hope that the Israeli and Palestinian sides\r\nwill take constructive measures and closely coordinate\r\nwith the international community in its mediating\r\nefforts so as to create conditions for easing the tension\r\nand reactivating the peace process. China supports a\r\ngreater role for the Security Council in this respect.\r\nWe are concerned about the situation in South\r\nAsia. Given the current complex situation, we hope\r\nthat the countries in the region will strengthen mutual\r\nunderstanding and mutual trust and coexist in peace\r\nand amity. As a neighbour of Afghanistan, we have\r\nbeen following the changing Afghan situation closely.\r\nWe believe that, in order to find a solution to the\r\nAfghan issue, the following principles should be\r\nobserved. First, the sovereignty, independence and\r\nterritorial integrity of Afghanistan should be ensured.\r\nSecondly, the Afghan people should be allowed to\r\ndecide on a solution independently. Thirdly, the future\r\ngovernment in Afghanistan should be broad-based and\r\nembody the interests of all ethnic groups in the\r\ncountry; Afghanistan should live in amity with all\r\ncountries, particularly its neighbours. Fourthly, the\r\nsolution should serve peace and stability in the region.\r\nFifthly, the United Nations should play a more active\r\nrole.\r\nSince the beginning of this year, the world\r\neconomy has clearly slowed down, and the situation\r\nhas been further aggravated by the incidents of 11\r\nSeptember. Developing countries are finding\r\nthemselves in increasingly dire straits. The\r\ninternational community must act with a greater sense\r\nof urgency and accord higher priority to development.\r\nDeveloped countries should act more vigorously\r\nto promote development. They should adopt effective\r\nmeasures and make greater efforts to revitalize the\r\nglobal economy. We hope that the developed countries\r\nwill demonstrate a broader vision and a cooperative\r\nspirit in providing assistance to developing countries.\r\nIn recent years, anti-globalization activities in\r\nmany parts of the world have increased. In fact,\r\nglobalization is neither a panacea for development nor\r\na monster causing disaster. The appropriate response to\r\nglobalization should maximize its advantages and\r\nminimize its disadvantages so that all countries can\r\ncome out winners and prosper side by side.\r\nGlobalization should benefit all people from all social\r\nstrata in all countries.\r\nThe United Nations has an irreplaceable role to\r\nplay in international cooperation in response to\r\nglobalization. It should increase its input in\r\ndevelopment and work more effectively to fulfil the\r\ndevelopment objectives set forth in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nChina is supportive of the World Trade\r\nOrganization’s plans to launch a new round of\r\nmultilateral trade talks. It is our hope that the new\r\nround will give full consideration to the concerns and\r\ninterests of the developing countries.\r\nThe Ninth Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\n(APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting was held\r\nsuccessfully in October in Shanghai, China. The\r\nmeeting was convened at a critical moment, soon after\r\nthe incidents of 11 September, when prospects for the\r\nglobal economy seemed grim. Focusing on the theme\r\n“Meeting new challenges in the new century:\r\npromoting common prosperity through participation\r\nand cooperation”, the leaders conducted an in-depth\r\nexchange of views and reached broad consensus.\r\nHaving boosted intra-APEC cooperation among the\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nmembers and reinforced their resolve to restore\r\neconomic growth, the meeting sent out a clear, positive\r\nsignal to markets throughout the world and took a\r\nresolute step forward in advancing cooperation in the\r\nAsia-Pacific region. The meeting will have a positive\r\nand far-reaching impact on Asia-Pacific economic\r\ncooperation.\r\nPresident Jiang Zemin made clear to the world\r\nChina’s future objectives, guiding principles and\r\ndomestic and foreign policies in the important speech\r\nthat he delivered on 1 July this year. The principal task\r\nfor the Chinese people in the new century is to press\r\nahead with the modernization programme, work\r\ntowards the grand cause of national reunification,\r\nsafeguard world peace and promote common\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIndeed, the purpose of China’s foreign policy is\r\nto safeguard world peace and promote common\r\ndevelopment. China needs an environment of\r\nfriendship and good-neighbourliness and external\r\nconditions of stability and prosperity. To achieve, and\r\nsafeguard, such an international environment serves\r\nChina’s national interests. It is also China’s duty as a\r\nmember of the international community.\r\nWe believe that all civilizations and social\r\nsystems in the world can, and should, exist side by side\r\non a long-term basis, complementing one another and\r\nmaking progress together, in a spirit of seeking\r\ncommon ground while putting aside differences.\r\nWe stand ready to engage in mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation with all countries in the world on an equal\r\nfooting towards world peace and development, with the\r\naim of achieving common development. Our entry into\r\nthe World Trade Organization will usher in a\r\ncompletely new phase of our opening-up process.\r\nThis year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the\r\nrestoration of China’s lawful seat in the United\r\nNations. Tremendous changes have since taken place in\r\nthe world, in China and in the United Nations. China’s\r\ncommitment to the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nhowever, remains unchanged. In the new century,\r\nChina will, as always, vigorously support the work of\r\nthe United Nations and continue to work together with\r\nother Member States for a better world.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Right Honourable Jack Straw,\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth\r\nAffairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nMr. Straw (United Kingdom): Please allow me\r\nwarmly to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThis day, 11 November, is the anniversary of the\r\nArmistice which ended the slaughter of the First World\r\nWar and is a day of remembrance here in the United\r\nStates, in the United Kingdom and across much of the\r\nworld. It is a day when all of us remember the sacrifice\r\nof those who, over the last century, gave their lives that\r\nothers might live in freedom.\r\nFor our parents and grandparents, the end of the\r\nSecond World War stood as a turning point, a moment\r\nto establish a new world order. Their vision was\r\ninscribed at the very beginning of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations:\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations,\r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from\r\nthe scourge of war”.\r\nWith these words, they founded the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nFor some of us, the subsequent half-century has\r\nbeen the most peaceful era of our history. Yet we know\r\nthat no one’s freedom can be secure while others suffer.\r\nOn this Remembrance Day, we remember\r\nsomething else — the thousands who died just two\r\nmonths ago, on 11 September. A third of the nations\r\nrepresented here in the General Assembly lost citizens\r\nat the World Trade Center. But just as our predecessors\r\nsaw hope in the midst of despair, so we now face the\r\ntask of building a new and better world.\r\nIt is fitting that it was here at the United Nations,\r\non 12 September, that the world began to fight back\r\nagainst the terrorist threat. We showed our joint\r\nresolve, in the Security Council and in the General\r\nAssembly, when we adopted resolutions demanding\r\nthat terrorists and those who harbour them be held to\r\naccount for their evil actions.\r\nI applaud Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), which established the Counter-terrorism\r\nCommittee and which requires all Member States to\r\nrespond to the global terrorist threat.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nWe do surely have to take every effective\r\nmeasure against international terrorist networks, whose\r\nmalign influence is felt in every part of the globe, not\r\nleast by adopting a comprehensive convention on\r\nterrorism and the draft Nuclear Terrorism Convention.\r\nWe also have to confront an unpalatable truth:\r\nthat we still face a real and immediate danger. The\r\nmurderous groups who plotted the terrible events of 11\r\nSeptember could strike again at any time. Thus our first\r\nduty, to our citizens and to each other, is to defend\r\nourselves against that threat.\r\nWhen the nations of the world agreed the United\r\nNations Charter, they recognized the right of self-\r\ndefence in Article 51. It is in exercise of this right that\r\nthe military coalition is now engaged in action against\r\nAl Qaeda and the Taliban regime which harbours them.\r\nTaking military action is always a tough decision.\r\nBut here it truly was unavoidable, and we all owe a\r\ndebt of gratitude to President Bush for the steadfast and\r\ncareful manner in which the United States proceeded.\r\nBut in defending the world from terror, we have\r\nto do our utmost to spare innocent Afghan people\r\nfurther suffering. For decades, the Afghans have seen\r\ntheir country exploited by outside powers and riven by\r\nconflict. In five years, their society has been\r\nsystematically destroyed by one of the most brutal\r\nregimes the world has ever known.\r\nBut at last today, the international community is\r\nunited in its efforts to feed and shelter the millions of\r\nrefugees through this harsh winter, and it is determined\r\nto help build a new Afghanistan.\r\nFor the first time in decades, there is consensus in\r\nthe Security Council as a whole, and among\r\nAfghanistan’s neighbours, that there should be a broad-\r\nbased government in Kabul, reflecting Afghanistan’s\r\nrich ethnic diversity, and that the future of Afghanistan\r\nmust be put into the hands of the Afghan people. There\r\nmust be no more Great Games with Afghan people as\r\nthe pawns, and no more regional rivalries, with Afghan\r\npeople as the victims.\r\nWe know that the one institution in the world\r\nwhich can deliver this better future is here now: the\r\nUnited Nations. We should all give Ambassador\r\nBrahimi every support in planning a future that leads to\r\nAfghanistan retaking its place as a fully fledged\r\nmember of the international community, able to protect\r\nand promote the interests of all of its people.\r\nThat nations have come so closely together to\r\nfight terrorism shows how the world is changing.\r\nHowever, we have to build a deeper and wider\r\nconsensus to tackle the other great issues which we\r\nface. It is not just the Afghan people who have been\r\nexcluded from the values on which the United Nations\r\nwas founded.\r\nConflict, poverty, discrimination and injustice\r\nstill blight the lives of millions in every part of the\r\nglobe. Individuals’ rights, especially women’s rights,\r\nare ignored with impunity, and then the very structure\r\nof communities collapses. Where this happens, where\r\nsocieties disintegrate or States fail, we put at risk the\r\nbasis of global society itself.\r\nIf 11 September teaches us anything, it is surely\r\nthis: that if we ignore our moral responsibilities to each\r\nother, we will be forced later to face painful\r\nconsequences.\r\nNowhere is the need for action now more obvious\r\nthan in Africa. Yes, there has been some progress there.\r\nInternational work on the ground to resolve conflict has\r\nbrought hope to Sierra Leone and to the Great Lakes\r\nregion. Responsible Governments working across the\r\ncontinent in partnership with effective international\r\ndonors have succeeded in reducing poverty. But we\r\nshould not delude ourselves about the scale of the task\r\nthat remains in Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa average\r\nincome today is much lower than it was 30 years ago.\r\nThe New Partnership for African Development\r\ntherefore requires the support of the whole community\r\nof nations. Africa deserves the same opportunities that\r\nwe in the West take for granted. We in the West must\r\nacknowledge that while removing barriers to global\r\ntrade and to finance, we have not always dismantled\r\nbarriers to dignity and equality. In theory, global free\r\ntrade should have created the conditions for every\r\neconomy to exploit its comparative advantage in the\r\nworld marketplace. In practice, protectionist barriers\r\nstill survive, especially against trade in agriculture,\r\ndamaging Africa’s interests today, and all our interests\r\ntomorrow.\r\nAs we meet here in New York, our colleagues at\r\nthe World Trade Organization meeting in Doha have\r\nthe opportunity to begin to put these injustices right.\r\nLaunching a new trade round would be the clearest\r\npossible signal of the world’s determination to spread\r\nthe benefits of wealth and of prosperity more fairly.\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nOur predecessors gave us the United Nations. In\r\nthe succeeding years, it developed expertise in\r\npeacekeeping, in conflict prevention, in human rights\r\nand in reconstruction, to consolidate the gains of 1945.\r\nMy message today is that our generation faces as\r\ndaunting a task, but a different one. That task is to\r\ndefeat international terrorism. But to do that we have to\r\ncombine the agenda of 10 September with the agenda\r\nof 11 September, as the Secretary-General emphasized\r\nin his powerful speech yesterday. And we must take not\r\nonly military action, but also diplomatic action to\r\nreduce tensions that terrorists exploit.\r\nNowhere are those tensions greater than in the\r\nMiddle East. The path to a settlement there is plain. It\r\nhas to be based on a political process that implements\r\nUnited Nations resolutions. It must deliver security for\r\nIsrael within recognized borders while at the same time\r\ncreating a viable Palestinian State. We should give the\r\nparties every help to reach a settlement. But our efforts\r\nwill be wasted unless the parties themselves show the\r\npolitical will to bring violence to a halt, and the\r\npolitical courage to make a deal.\r\nWe have seen, in the most graphic and brutal way\r\npossible, that chaos in one part of the world can\r\nundermine security in all parts of the world. Against\r\nthat chaos we must set our vision of peaceful\r\ncooperation among stable nations. Achieving that\r\nvision has now taken on a new urgency. Indeed, we are\r\nat a moment of strategic opportunity, which comes no\r\nmore than once to any generation. We owe it to those\r\nwho founded the international community to seize this\r\nmoment. Most of all, we owe it to those who will come\r\nafter us.\r\nToday we remember with sorrow the sacrifices\r\nthat earlier generations made. We remember with pride\r\nthe brave decisions that they took to build a better\r\nworld for us, and we salute the reconciliation and\r\nrecovery that followed. My hope is that our children\r\nand our grandchildren will look back on this period\r\nwith no less pride, and that future generations will be\r\nable to say that we here faced up to a great evil; we did\r\nnot duck the decisions we had to take; we established\r\npeace in Afghanistan, constructive coexistence in the\r\nMiddle East and sustained development in Africa. We\r\nmade the necessary endeavour in the finest tradition of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations stands for everything the\r\nterrorist seeks to destroy. My hope is that our\r\nsuccessors will look back on this era and say that we\r\nsaved succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nterrorism as well as from the scourge of war.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Erkki Tuomioja, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Finland.\r\nMr. Tuomioja (Finland): The terrorist attacks of\r\n11 September are going to thoroughly change the\r\nworld, but we do not yet know how. The aftermath of\r\nthese events has shown that there are more issues that\r\nunite us than issues that separate us. We also know that\r\npreventing terrorism and other global threats requires\r\nthe broadest possible cooperation. The United Nations\r\nis the main forum for such cooperation. This was\r\ndemonstrated immediately after the attacks, when both\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council\r\npromptly condemned the terrorist attacks as threats to\r\ninternational peace and security and expressed their\r\nreadiness to combat all forms of terrorism. Now it is\r\nextremely urgent to finalize the negotiations on a\r\ncomprehensive convention on the suppression of\r\ninternational terrorism. I appeal to everyone to quickly\r\nagree on the outstanding draft in question.\r\nMr. Hor Namhong (Cambodia), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThese attacks have also profoundly affected our\r\nsense of security, both as Member States and as\r\nindividuals. Fear and insecurity were globalized\r\novernight. But democratic societies cannot be\r\ndestroyed by such acts. When faced with threats our\r\ncommon values and democracy will only get stronger.\r\nFinland condemns terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, and whoever its victims may be. There\r\nis no justification for it.\r\nI extend, on behalf of the Government of Finland,\r\nour condolences to the families of the victims, to the\r\ncitizens of New York and to all Americans, including\r\nPresident Bush. We have expressed our solidarity with\r\nthe United States, as we would have done with any\r\nother country affected by such attacks.\r\nThe rapidly changing world and the new threats\r\nrequire changed thinking in the international\r\norganizations. We must respond quickly and efficiently\r\nto the challenges of the real world. We cannot bury\r\nourselves in old rhetoric and positions when people\r\noutside require concrete action and help. International\r\ncooperation, after all, benefits all States, big and small.\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nI hope that the unique coalition and cooperation against\r\nterrorism will be reflected on other issues of common\r\nconcern to us.\r\nThe statement in the Millennium Declaration that\r\nthe United Nations is\r\n“the indispensable common house of the entire\r\nhuman family, through which we will seek to\r\nrealize our universal aspirations for peace,\r\ncooperation and development” (resolution 55/2,\r\npara. 32)\r\nis now truer than ever. The fight against terrorism and\r\nthe Afghan situation are at the top of the United\r\nNations agenda, but there are other issues and\r\nprocesses that require true cooperation in order to be\r\nsuccessful. In this context, I would like to underline the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\r\nthe world conferences on sustainable development,\r\nfinancing for development and children.\r\nOne of our common responsibilities is the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This is\r\none of the issues that unites us and is in everybody’s\r\ninterest. The United Nations is the only international\r\norganization with global competence in the area of\r\nsecurity policies. Ongoing crises are, however, so\r\ncomplex that they require united efforts and combined\r\nresources. This is particularly true of the Middle East,\r\nwhere a return to the peace process is an urgent\r\nnecessity. To this end, we will have to pressure both\r\nparties, as well as those who can influence them.\r\nThe complexity of international crises has\r\nrequired a close and comprehensive look by the United\r\nNations at how to improve its performance in peace\r\noperations. The whole continuum that reaches from\r\nconflict prevention, through crisis management to post-\r\nconflict peace-building, with a strong emphasis on\r\npreventive action in every phase, requires a fresh\r\napproach, as proposed in the report of the Brahimi\r\nPanel and in the comprehensive review of the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations. Finland\r\nsupports the full implementation of such an approach.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nprevention of armed conflicts and its recommendations\r\nare important contributions to the core activities of the\r\nUnited Nations. The Secretary-General’s call,\r\nreiterated by the Security Council, on the development\r\nof a comprehensive conflict-prevention strategy is\r\ntimely and warranted. By the adoption of the\r\nProgramme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, the\r\nEuropean Union has underlined its political\r\ncommitment to pursue conflict prevention as one of the\r\nmain objectives in its external relations. This is also a\r\ngood example of mutually supportive actions by the\r\nUnited Nations and the European Union. This is again\r\nan issue that requires a holistic view and a system-wide\r\napproach.\r\nFinland supports increased focus on the part of\r\nthe United Nations on crisis prevention and the root\r\ncauses of conflicts. Promotion of democracy, human\r\nrights, the rule of law, increased equality and social\r\ndevelopment, as well as the prevention of\r\nenvironmental threats and the eradication of poverty,\r\ndiscrimination, racism and impunity, all point in the\r\nsame direction.\r\nThe complexity of current crises — be they in\r\nAfghanistan, the Middle East, the Balkans or Africa —\r\nand the limited resources available have made different\r\norganizations seek cooperation and complementarity in\r\ntheir actions. Chapter VIII of the United Nations\r\nCharter puts strong emphasis on regional arrangements\r\naimed at dealing with issues relating to international\r\npeace and security. The Security Council should utilize\r\nsuch regional arrangements for enforcement action.\r\nThe European Union is in the process of\r\ndeveloping its own crisis-management capability, in\r\nterms of both civilian and military capacities. In this\r\nwork, Finland, just like the entire European Union, is\r\ncommitted to contributing to international peace and\r\nsecurity, in accordance with the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe European Union has adopted conclusions on\r\nits cooperation in conflict prevention and crisis\r\nmanagement with the United Nations. Areas and\r\nmodalities for such cooperation have been identified in\r\nclose cooperation with the United Nations. It will\r\nprogress as the European Common Security and\r\nDefence Policy develops its focus on substantive issues\r\nand concrete needs in a pragmatic manner. This\r\ncooperation focuses on conflict prevention, civilian and\r\nmilitary aspects of crisis management and on regional\r\ncrises like the ones in the western Balkans, the Middle\r\nEast and Africa.\r\nThere will be a wider and more concrete scope\r\nfor cooperation within two years when the European\r\nUnion achieves its military capability. At present, it is\r\ndifficult to say what kind of operations the European\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nUnion could or would execute and when it could do so.\r\nIn Finland’s case, our law requires that either the\r\nUnited Nations or the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe mandate such an operation.\r\nIn today’s complex crises civilian aspects of crisis\r\nmanagement have and will become all the more\r\nrelevant in all organizations. The European Union has\r\ndeveloped its civilian capabilities in four priority areas,\r\nnamely civilian police, strengthening the rule of law,\r\nstrengthening civilian administration and civil\r\nprotection. In these areas, the European Union and the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as other international\r\norganizations, must also seek synergies and\r\ncomplementarity.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and the Millennium\r\nDeclaration are outstanding achievements in the history\r\nof the United Nations. The Declaration manifests a\r\nunique commitment to multilateralism by all the\r\nMember States of the United Nations. It sets an\r\nambitious agenda and goals for the United Nations for\r\nyears to come. However, without effective\r\nimplementation it is only a piece of paper. Its\r\nimplementation also requires common action and\r\nstrengthened commitment to multilateralism. The\r\nSecretary-General’s road map gives us guidance on\r\nhow to maintain the millennium momentum and how to\r\nproceed, although the onus is on the Member States.\r\nThis year alone the United Nations has organized\r\nfive conferences and special sessions and hundreds of\r\nother meetings that are an integral part of the follow-up\r\nand implementation of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThese processes should show the same kind of\r\ncommitment as was encountered in the Summit.\r\nUnfortunately, I have to say that none of these recent\r\nconferences and special sessions has come close to\r\nreflecting the commitment that was so noticeable in the\r\nMillennium Summit. We need invigorated common\r\nefforts to genuinely implement the ambitious agenda\r\nadopted only a year ago and to uphold multilateralism.\r\nI hope we can see improvement in this respect in\r\ncoming summits and conferences.\r\nThe moral and political commitment to the\r\nDeclaration should lead to its effective implementation.\r\nThe strong support for these common objectives and\r\nour determination to achieve them need much more\r\naction in order to become a reality. Such challenges as\r\nhalving, by the year 2015, the proportion of people\r\nliving in poverty should not be jeopardized by narrow\r\nnational interests.\r\nGlobalization and harnessing it to benefit all\r\nhumankind remain one of the major challenges to the\r\ninternational community. A common approach is\r\nneeded in this work too. We have to learn how to deal\r\nwith the paradox of democracy spreading across the\r\nworld, and there is much disillusionment about its\r\nworkings. The key to explaining this paradox is\r\nglobalization. It poses a demand to develop strong,\r\nnew, democratic policies and institutions for\r\ninternational and global governance. They must be\r\ndeveloped in the United Nations, but also at the\r\nregional level, such as in the European Union.\r\nThe Government of Finland recently prepared a\r\nstudy on Finnish policies on globalization. One of its\r\nmain conclusions was that in resolving multinational\r\ncrises created by globalization, the role of cooperation\r\nbetween national Governments will be growing, not\r\ndiminishing. The United Nations is the most universal\r\nforum for intergovernmental cooperation. Finland\r\nsupports the United Nations as one of the central actors\r\nin harnessing globalization at the universal level.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Reinaldo Ruggiero, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Italy.\r\nMr. Ruggiero (Italy): I wish to congratulate the\r\nPresident on his election to head the first session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of the new millennium. I am certain\r\nthat his experience and commitment will enable us to\r\nachieve the high goals that we all share. I also renew\r\nthe Italian Government’s warmest congratulations to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on his receipt of the\r\nNobel Peace Prize. His appointment to a second term to\r\nthe leadership of the United Nations is both welcome\r\nand unanimously appreciated.\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belgium\r\naddressed the General Assembly yesterday, speaking\r\non behalf of the European Union. Italy fully shares his\r\nviews and supports his statement.\r\nLike our Belgian colleague and previous\r\nspeakers, I would like to express once more, on this\r\nsolemn occasion, to the Government and people of the\r\nUnited States our deep solidarity following the\r\nappalling terrorist acts perpetrated against them. We\r\nshare their suffering over the shocking loss of human\r\nlife and the sorrow of thousands of families.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nThese acts defy the most basic values of civil\r\ncoexistence. We condemn them and reaffirm our full\r\ncommitment to the fight against international terrorism,\r\na struggle on which the United Nations has conferred\r\nfull legitimacy. We believe that the United Nations\r\nremains the central forum to which we must turn in\r\ndrafting a comprehensive response to terrorism.\r\nThis is why we need strict application of the full\r\nrange of measures adopted by the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council during the days immediately\r\nfollowing the 11 September attacks. Resolution 1373\r\n(2001), in particular, must be implemented, urgently\r\nand vigorously. I also hope that everyone shows the\r\nnecessary flexibility to allow a swift conclusion of the\r\nnegotiations on a comprehensive convention against\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nOn 7 November, by a majority of more than 90\r\nper cent, the Italian Parliament approved the\r\nGovernment’s decision to contribute ground troops,\r\nnaval forces and air units to operations against\r\ninternational terrorism. This confirms my country’s\r\nawareness that the stakes are high and proves the\r\nrobustness of our national consensus in facing this\r\nchallenge. The fight must be conducted in a targeted\r\nmanner, avoiding the loss of innocent lives, until the\r\nobjective has been fully achieved, without, however,\r\nneglecting humanitarian assistance to the Afghan\r\npeople, both within the country and in the refugee\r\ncamps. But the problem of the political future of\r\nAfghanistan, a problem to be solved only by the\r\nAfghan people, must, of course, remain a high priority\r\nin the agenda of the United Nations, together with the\r\nobjective of regional stability.\r\nBut in crafting a credible, diversified global\r\nstrategy to eradicate international terrorism, we must\r\nalso search for solutions to the most delicate regional\r\ncrises and to the global problems that loom over our\r\nlives. These include hunger, poverty, ignorance,\r\ninequality, underdevelopment, violation of human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms and threats to the\r\nenvironment and health.\r\nAt the top of the list of regional crises is the\r\nMiddle East, an area physically close to Italy, and one\r\nto which we pay close attention. Here, we are working\r\nboth in a national capacity and within the European\r\nUnion to create, as soon as possible, the conditions for\r\nan end to the violence and a true return to negotiations\r\nfor a comprehensive, lasting peace in the region based\r\non the establishment of a viable and democratic State\r\nfor the Palestinians and an end to the occupation of\r\ntheir territories and on Israel’s right to live in peace\r\nand security within internationally recognized borders.\r\nThis framework should also include an ambitious\r\nplan, like the one adopted to rebuild a devastated\r\nEurope in the wake of World War II, for public and\r\nprivate investments and inter-regional assistance\r\ntowards fostering solidarity among the region’s States\r\nand peoples — in other words, a new Marshall Plan.\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to the economic and\r\nsocial growth and development of the Palestinian\r\npopulation, to which Italy is fully committed and for\r\nwhich it remains prepared to do more in the future.\r\nIn the Balkans, we have noted encouraging\r\nprogress despite persisting tensions. Our goal there is\r\nto prevent destabilizing tendencies and to foster\r\nregional cooperation and economic development,\r\nincluding closer ties with the European Union.\r\nAs for the challenges of globalization, we should\r\nfirst of all make the success of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Conference in Doha a\r\nprimary objective. In fact, many of the global problems\r\nI have listed can be alleviated by ensuring that the\r\ninternational market economy and multilateral free\r\ntrade operate fairly and continue to foster\r\ninclusiveness, integration and more equitable and\r\nsustainable growth of all countries through agreed\r\nrules. This latest WTO round should be one of growth\r\nand development, focusing in particular on the\r\nproblems of the developing and least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nBut in order to assure a better response to\r\nglobalization’s most problematic aspects, other major\r\nobjectives must be pursued. And the universal\r\norganization with the moral authority to meet this\r\nchallenge is the United Nations.\r\nThe first objective is the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Italy’s commitment is\r\nstrong and long-standing. In fact, we are one of the top\r\nthree contributors of men and resources to peace\r\noperations led and authorized by the United Nations. In\r\nthis light, we appreciate the reports that the Secretariat\r\nhas issued in the past two years, which suggest a vision\r\nof peace activity as a single, three-sided concept,\r\nencompassing conflict prevention, peacekeeping and\r\npost-conflict peace-building.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nItaly also values the document that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral submitted to Member States on the prevention\r\nof armed conflicts, emphasizing the direct connection\r\nbetween safeguarding peace and fighting\r\nunderdevelopment. In fact, no peacekeeping action can\r\nachieve lasting results unless it is coupled with\r\nmeasures to strengthen government institutions,\r\nsafeguard the human, civil and cultural rights of all\r\ncommunities and rebuild the economic and social fibre\r\nof affected areas.\r\nThe second objective is to foster development and\r\neradicate poverty. We must ensure that all the countries\r\nof the world benefit from the opportunities created by\r\ninterdependencies and progress, in particular in the\r\nareas of information and communication technology.\r\nThe global United Nations conferences of the 1990s\r\nlaid the groundwork for the definition of poverty as a\r\nmultidimensional phenomenon. It is not only\r\ncharacterized by low income and consumption, but also\r\na lack of food, health care, schooling and\r\nenvironmental stability. This is a vicious cycle that we\r\nmust break, through coordinated and integrated\r\ninitiatives. To reverse the downward spiral, we must\r\nenhance both the material and the human dimensions of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration spells out the\r\nobjectives to be attained by 2015. Italy has shown its\r\ncommitment to these goals through the shaping of its\r\ninternational actions and the shouldering of its\r\nresponsibilities during the year of its G-8 presidency.\r\nOne example was the substantive outreach initiative at\r\nthe Genoa Summit, involving a meeting with five\r\nAfrican Heads of State and the Secretary-General to\r\ndiscuss the New African Initiative and launch a global\r\nfund to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious\r\ndiseases.\r\nFinally, we must continue to nurture and\r\nstrengthen development assistance and reach the goal\r\nof having the most developed countries dedicate 0.7\r\nper cent of their gross national product to this pursuit.\r\nIn this context, debt relief is another essential tool to\r\nfree up the necessary resources in developing countries\r\nin order to stimulate their economies, for instance by\r\npromoting public investment in health care and\r\nschooling. Italy is a leader in this field by virtue of\r\nrecent laws that allow it to gradually cancel the debt of\r\nthe poorest countries.\r\nAs I said before, the United Nations has the moral\r\nauthority to take on today’s new challenges. This fact\r\nwas highlighted by the awarding of the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize to the Secretary-General and to the Organization\r\nas a whole. However, its structure and procedures must\r\nkeep pace with the times. Italy believes in the reform\r\nof the United Nations, a reform that should affect all of\r\nits bodies, including the Security Council. Let me\r\nreiterate the need for a comprehensive reform that\r\naddresses the relevant issues in all their aspects. Such a\r\nreform should be designed to produce greater\r\nefficiency, legitimacy and transparency. It should also\r\nmeet the general expectations of democracy,\r\nuniversality and inclusiveness.\r\nIn addition, to create the conditions for stable\r\ngrowth of prosperity and security for all humankind,\r\nwe need more effective governance of globalization.\r\nThe documents prepared by the Secretariat make great\r\nstrides in this direction. Now is the time to translate the\r\ncommitments of the Millennium Declaration into\r\naction. Italy will support every initiative undertaken for\r\nthis purpose.\r\nNever have we had a better opportunity to solve\r\nour problems, yet never have we faced greater risks.\r\nThe answer does not lie in denying the reality of\r\ninterdependence and growing globalization. It is within\r\nour ability to promote better governance of the\r\ninternational system. Never before has the world had so\r\nmany human, financial and technological resources at\r\nits disposal. The answer lies in our hands, in our\r\ncollective will.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of Djibouti, Mr. Ali Abdi\r\nFarah.\r\nMr. Farah (Djibouti)(spoke in French): In view\r\nof the catastrophic events that took place on 11\r\nSeptember, it is only fitting that first and foremost we\r\nonce again offer our deepest condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States. This was\r\na hateful and diabolical act of terrorism that claimed\r\nthousands of precious human lives and caused untold\r\nphysical destruction, without parallel in history. This\r\nbrutal attack has put us all on notice. It was truly the\r\nday the world changed.\r\nOne way or another, this tragedy affects us all.\r\nNot a single country is immune from terrorism,\r\ninasmuch as it is beyond the capacity of any one\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\ncountry to counter it. The international community\r\nmust work together, ideally through the United\r\nNations, so that the counter-measures take the form of\r\nlegitimacy and acceptability. In this respect, Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) provides us with the\r\nnecessary framework.\r\nWe in Djibouti have already established a suitable\r\nmechanism to counter terrorism, in all its aspects, that\r\ncould come from our territory. We are also in the\r\nprocess of examining the existing international\r\nconventions and protocols on terrorism with a view to\r\nsigning and ratifying them all. However, while doing\r\nall this, we must not lose sight of the plight of the\r\npeople of Afghanistan — the terror, the desperation\r\nand the starvation facing impoverished people during\r\nthis grave crisis. Also, we must not squander the\r\nextraordinary opportunity we now have to examine all\r\npossible or probable causes and deep roots of\r\nterrorism, including attitudes, frustrations and current\r\neconomic and political conditions.\r\nMay I join the delegations that preceded me to\r\noffer the President our congratulations on his brilliant\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-sixth session. His vast experience and\r\ndemonstrated capacity and skills will indeed be vital to\r\nour deliberations. We also wish to express our\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of\r\nFinland, whose leadership at the fifty-fifth session has\r\nresulted in tangible achievements.\r\nPermit me also to congratulate Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan on his re-election and for the work he\r\naccomplished during his first term, most notably for\r\nthe extent to which he was able to institute much-\r\nneeded reforms and restore the relevance and central\r\nrole of the United Nations, while enhancing its\r\ncapacity and effectiveness. He has recognized that far\r\ntoo many people live on the margins of society,\r\nreduced to silence by endemic poverty, debt, the AIDS\r\npandemic, tuberculosis and malaria. He has, in effect,\r\nbecome the voice of the world’s silent majority. It is\r\nnot by chance, therefore, that, together with the\r\nOrganization he heads, he has received the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize. We congratulate him wholeheartedly for\r\nthis distinct and rare honour bestowed upon him and\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nMay I pay tribute to the Secretary-General for the\r\nbreadth and relevance of his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. The United Nations has a vital role to\r\nplay in today’s rapidly evolving world, and the report\r\noffers a comprehensive update on all its activities. With\r\nreference to peace and security, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has stressed, we must all be struck by the\r\nnumber of conflicts raging in the world today.\r\nPreventing the recurrence of conflict is a central\r\npriority, and this means that our focus needs to shift\r\nfrom a culture of management and control to one of\r\nprevention and long-term development.\r\nBesides conflict, we are witness to enormous\r\nhuman suffering caused by natural disasters and\r\ncomplex situations that continue to grow in scale,\r\nescalating the need for humanitarian assistance.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Secretary-General\r\ncontinues to place importance on the fight against\r\nendemic poverty and that the international community\r\nhas launched a sustained campaign to make the right to\r\ndevelopment a palpable reality for everyone. The\r\nparticipation of the poor must become a priority in\r\norder to eradicate rural poverty, to ensure the well-\r\nbeing of children and to strengthen the earning\r\npotential of women.\r\nIf we are to reduce by half the number of people\r\nliving in poverty by 2015, as called for in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, we must substantially increase\r\nOfficial Development Assistance, alleviate the debt\r\nburden of the poorest countries and dismantle the\r\nprotectionist barriers of developed countries. The Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, in particular, face enormous\r\nobstacles, such as declining inflows of capital,\r\ninadequate social services and the lack of\r\ninfrastructure, in addition to environmental constraints.\r\nIn essence, the Brussels Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the\r\nDecade 2001-2010 call for an increase in foreign\r\ncapital inflows, including Official Development\r\nAssistance; direct foreign investment; an expansion of\r\ndebt relief; greater preferential market access and\r\nincreased technical assistance.\r\nSilently but very quickly, the world is drifting\r\ntowards another dangerous crisis: water scarcity. By\r\n2025, one in every three people worldwide will be\r\naffected by the lack of water. Some 2.7 billion people\r\nlive in regions facing severe water shortages and, once\r\nagain, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, which are the\r\nmost densely populated areas and among the areas of\r\nleast income, will be the hardest hit. Currently, 450\r\nmillion people living in 29 countries, including my\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nown, Djibouti, are experiencing acute drinking water\r\nshortages. Unlike oil and most other strategic\r\nresources, drinking water has no substitute. Whether\r\nwater is needed for drinking, agriculture or\r\nenvironment-related purposes, such as the survival of\r\nlakes and rivers, we have on our hands a potential\r\ncrisis that risks causing an unprecedented disaster for\r\nfood security and the fight against hunger and poverty.\r\nA combination of global warming, wasteful habits,\r\naridity and the lack of rainfall means that the water\r\nsources millions traditionally rely on are now slowly\r\ndrying up. There is no longer enough water for all our\r\nneeds. Beyond the international treaties and\r\ninstitutional mechanisms, the international community\r\nmust act to mitigate this crisis. Now is the time to act.\r\nWhile the recent international terrorist attacks in\r\nthe United States have rightly dominated the world’s\r\nattention, other pressing problems, such as the AIDS\r\npandemic, must still be urgently attended to. The\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly devoted to this\r\nscourge, held in June, took a decisive step towards\r\nfinding collective solutions, actions and commitments.\r\nHowever, there is still concern that these non-binding\r\ncommitments may not be carried out. The global AIDS\r\nfund launched by the Secretary-General has made some\r\nprogress, but contributions to date have fallen far short\r\nof the expected target. We are now unfortunately\r\nfamiliar with the statistics of deaths and the social and\r\neconomic devastation caused by this scourge,\r\nparticularly in Africa. In the search for a solution and\r\nwhat measures to take, the debate has centred on\r\ntreatment versus prevention. Ideally, the best hope\r\nwould be for a preventative vaccine, but that solution\r\ndoes not look promising. As one expert put it, “We are\r\nat the end of the beginning of this epidemic, not at the\r\nbeginning of its end!”\r\nThe growth and exponential spread of\r\ninformation technology, coupled with the demise of the\r\ncold war, have, over the past decade, been determining\r\nfactors in shaping our views on development and the\r\nglobal economy. With the advent of globalization, trade\r\nexpanded, capital flowed, investments increased,\r\neconomies liberalized and barriers to trade were\r\nlowered. In addition, the private sector took on a\r\ncentral role.\r\nUnfortunately, as many have correctly observed,\r\nthe number of countries and individuals excluded from\r\nthe benefits of this phenomenon has risen inexorably.\r\nThe attempt to explain this dichotomy has led to many\r\ntroubling conclusions. For the poverty-stricken who\r\nlive on $1 per day, talk of technology, economic\r\ngrowth, opportunity and prosperity is no more than\r\nnice-sounding words. Their greatest daily concern is\r\nthe fear of not having enough to eat. Finding enough to\r\neat is a daily challenge for more than three billion\r\npeople on this planet. Despite the conflicts in Africa\r\ncurrently making headlines, it is the precarious\r\nexistence of those left behind that has defined life on\r\nthe African continent for more than two generations.\r\nWhatever the reasons for this endemic poverty,\r\nthe fact remains that unless we address the problem of\r\npoverty in all its aspects, we will not get to the roots of\r\nthe problem. It is well known that millions of people in\r\nAfrica and throughout the world are simply too poor to\r\nparticipate in the phenomenon of globalization and thus\r\nmiss out on the benefits of globalization. The President\r\nof the World Bank has aptly put the issue of poverty in\r\nperspective:\r\n“... if you cannot deal with the question of\r\npoverty, if you cannot deal with the issue of\r\nequity, then you are not dealing with the question\r\nof peace.”\r\nHe added:\r\n“We will not solve the problems of poverty or\r\nglobal peace or stability unless we change our\r\nperception of poor people from the objects of\r\ncharity to an asset on which you can build a better\r\nworld.”\r\nThe persistence and spread of poverty hamper all\r\nefforts for peace, security, development, democracy\r\nand good governance. Peace and security require\r\nincreasing and strengthening the United Nations\r\ncapacity to prevent crises, to react to emerging threats\r\nand to implement peace-building programmes. In this\r\nregard, the Security Council has a preponderant role. It\r\nis obvious that our inability to reform the Council so\r\nthat it can respond to the needs of the international\r\nreality of today can only diminish the legitimacy of its\r\nfunctioning and decisions.\r\nDuring the fifty-fourth session of the General\r\nAssembly in September 1999, my President, Ismail\r\nOmar Guelleh, outlined a series of proposals on the re-\r\nestablishment of peace in Somalia. A year later, during\r\nthe fifty-fifth session, he related to this Assembly the\r\nextraordinary sacrifices and burdens borne by the\r\nGovernment and people of Djibouti, together with a\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nnumber of Governments and organizations of good\r\nwill, to bring together the true representatives of the\r\nSomali people so that they might seize control of their\r\nown destiny and forge a new direction for their\r\ndevastated country.\r\nUltimately, after eight months of intense and\r\ndifficult negotiations at Arta, Djibouti, in August 2000,\r\nthe Somali State was reborn through the establishment\r\nof the Transitional National Government, the National\r\nAssembly and other institutions. The course has not\r\nbeen easy, but the Transitional National Government\r\nhas persisted and pursued its commitments, gaining the\r\nrespect, sympathy and support of the international\r\ncommunity, despite myriad attempts to undermine its\r\nefforts to achieve lasting peace.\r\nThe Transitional National Government is a\r\nreality. It represents the will of the people of Somalia,\r\nwho have spoken and made their choice. As my\r\nPresident has repeatedly stated, if we wish to save\r\nSomalia from disintegration and chaos, we must\r\neschew the standard practice of revolving around a few\r\nall-too-familiar individuals who held the Somali people\r\nhostage for a decade. He suggested, inter alia, that it\r\nwas time to move beyond them, to restore power to the\r\npeople, and for the Somali people to assume leadership\r\nand responsibility for their own destiny.\r\nWe are gratified that the Transitional National\r\nGovernment is fully committed to bringing about\r\nlasting peace in Somalia through a constructive spirit\r\nof dialogue and tolerance. Building upon the outcome\r\nof the Arta process, the Transitional National\r\nGovernment has consistently and tirelessly\r\ndemonstrated its unwavering commitment to\r\nreconciling with its adversaries without preconditions.\r\nIts efforts to that end have been greatly appreciated by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity and by the Security\r\nCouncil. Both entities have recently condemned those\r\nindividuals and faction leaders who remain outside the\r\nArta peace process and who stubbornly persist in\r\nblocking the peace efforts in Somalia.\r\nIn this respect, the efforts of the President of\r\nKenya, Mr. Daniel Arap Moi, earlier this month to\r\nbring some of these recalcitrants into the Arta process\r\nare to be strongly commended. That is what is expected\r\nof us; it is a moral and political duty we owe to the\r\npeople of Somalia. That was the message of the\r\nSecurity Council’s presidential statement on Somalia\r\nlast month:\r\n“[T]he situation in Somalia and the objective of\r\nlong-term regional stability can most effectively\r\nbe addressed if neighbouring States play a\r\npositive role, including in the process of\r\nrebuilding national institutions in Somalia.”\r\n(S/PRST/2001/30, p. 2)\r\nWhile the Republic of Djibouti is not in the habit\r\nof challenging anyone on the veracity of information\r\nwithin their purview, it has nonetheless a moral duty to\r\nissue a caution about the source, motivation, accuracy,\r\nobjectivity and reliability of such information,\r\nparticularly as it relates to the crucial and sensitive\r\nissue of the existence of terrorist cells in one country or\r\nanother. I am convinced that close consultation and\r\ncooperation with all countries in the region on this\r\nimportant issue will yield realistic and impartial\r\ninformation in the assessment of any particular\r\nsituation. It must be pointed out, however, that haste\r\nand rash, uncorroborated conclusions will only harm\r\nthe unity of the international coalition against\r\nterrorism, which we all vigorously support.\r\nAt a time when the attention of the international\r\ncommunity is squarely focused on the issue of\r\nterrorism, the brutality and destructive force used\r\nagainst the Palestinians have increased dramatically.\r\nIsrael has created the conditions for chaos and anarchy\r\nto justify its reoccupation and even annexation of\r\nPalestinian territory. The recent incursions represent\r\nthe broadest military operations in years in Palestinian-\r\ncontrolled territory. Each day we drift closer to an\r\nunacceptable conflagration between two parties that are\r\nunequal in power, means, resources and international\r\ninfluence.\r\nInsisting on a ceasefire without offering anything\r\nin return, Israel is determined to pursue its defiance of\r\ninternational opinion. Living conditions in the\r\noccupied territories continue to be seriously affected by\r\nthe Israeli blockade. Rising unemployment, failing\r\nbusinesses, falling incomes, restrictions on the\r\nmovement of goods and people and the banning of\r\nconstruction while Jewish settlement activities\r\ncontinue all combine to inflame an already incendiary\r\nsituation. One wonders, therefore, what more the\r\nIsraelis want to hear than the imploring words of\r\nPresident Arafat: “Let us go back to implementing the\r\naccords. Let us go back to saving the peace process\r\nwith no conditions and no military pressures.”\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nWe call on Israel to relinquish Orient House and\r\nother Palestinian offices in and around Jerusalem. We\r\nalso urge it to return to the negotiating table and,\r\namong other things, to implement the proposals\r\ncontained in the Mitchell Committee report. Israel must\r\nrelease the millions of dollars in tax money owed to the\r\nPalestinian Authority in order to alleviate the economic\r\nand financial hardships inflicted upon the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nIn the final analysis, Israel’s security largely\r\ndepends on the implementation of the principle of a\r\nviable Palestinian State. We hope that the international\r\ncommunity will also commit itself to restoring dignity\r\nand respect to the Palestinian people. Like all peoples\r\neverywhere, they have a right to live in peace and to\r\nenjoy a decent existence.\r\nIn our subregion of the Horn of Africa, there has\r\nbeen some reduction in hostilities despite lingering\r\ndifferences and antagonisms. The people in that area of\r\nthe world have suffered too long and desire nothing\r\nmore than a relaxation of tensions, the free movement\r\nof people and goods, lasting peace, stability,\r\ndevelopment and cooperation. It is high time that we\r\ndevoted our meagre resources to development and to\r\nimproving the living conditions and meeting the needs\r\nof our own people. Let us give our people a break and a\r\nbetter future.\r\nDjibouti truly believes in regional cooperation,\r\ngood-neighbourliness and the opportunities they can\r\nafford for all our people. We are committed to working\r\nhand in hand with our friends in the subregion to\r\nresolve outstanding issues in complete harmony and\r\ntrust. As a nation, we are challenged by scant resources\r\nand declining international assistance, which have been\r\nexacerbated by the huge influx of drought-affected\r\npeople and economic migrants. Our capital city, in\r\nparticular, is overburdened by an influx of people\r\ndisplaced by drought or political tensions in the region,\r\nthus further straining our limited infrastructure and\r\nsocial services. We appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to help us overcome these unsustainable\r\nchallenges and pressures that have been with us for too\r\nlong and are beyond our limited means.\r\nMr. Ping (Gabon) (spoke in French):\r\nI would like to begin by congratulating the President\r\non his outstanding election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. His election reflects\r\nthe recognition by the international community of the\r\nplace and the role that the Republic of Korea, a great\r\nfriend of Gabon, plays in the world and particularly in\r\nAsia. I would like to assure him of our full cooperation\r\nduring his period of office.\r\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\r\nI express the satisfaction of my delegation for the\r\nexcellent work done in the course of the last session.\r\nAnd to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, I\r\nwould like to reaffirm the highest appreciation of the\r\nGovernment and the head of State of Gabon, His\r\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, for the dedication\r\nand determination with which he has endeavoured to\r\nmake a reality of the ideals of peace, justice and\r\nwelfare contained in the United Nations Charter. The\r\nNobel Peace Prize, which has just been awarded to him\r\nas well as to the United Nations, is eloquent testimony\r\nto the work being done by the United Nations system to\r\npromote peace and build a more prosperous world. He\r\ncan rest assured of Gabon’s support for his efforts in\r\nthe service of the United Nations.\r\nIt is little more than a year ago that the heads of\r\nState and Government of the Member States of the\r\nUnited Nations met here in New York at the historic\r\nMillennium Summit. On that occasion, they laid down\r\nthe guidelines for the future work of the international\r\ncommunity and reaffirmed their commitment to the\r\npurposes and principles set forth in the Charter of our\r\nOrganization. The Millennium Summit thus enabled\r\nour nations to renew their commitment to act in unity\r\nand solidarity in order to take up the numerous\r\nchallenges facing the world.\r\nThe tragedy which took place on 11 September\r\n2001 in the United States of America has, more than\r\never, strengthened our determination to combat\r\ninternational terrorism. We must put an end to it by all\r\npossible means — military, diplomatic and political. It\r\nis for this reason that Gabon unreservedly supports\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\r\n(2001) as well as the adoption of a comprehensive\r\nconvention on terrorism.\r\nThere is no possible doubt that the coalition\r\nwhich has been created will be victorious in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. In this surge of solidarity, the\r\ninternational community must, in parallel, find\r\nappropriate responses to the world problems that can\r\nserve as a pretext for certain radical groups. There is an\r\nurgent need to act to find solutions to the conflicts and\r\neconomic and social problems of our time.\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nAs far as armed conflicts are concerned, we are\r\nconvinced that if illicit trafficking in small arms and\r\nlight weapons could be ended, it would be easier to\r\narrive at a prompt and lasting settlement. The\r\nimplementation by everyone of the recommendations\r\nof the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held\r\nhere in New York last July, would enable us to reach\r\nthat goal.\r\nFaithful to the commitment of President Omar\r\nBongo, Gabon remains committed to and involved in\r\nefforts to restore peace in the world, particularly in\r\nAfrica. Here, I would like to express our satisfaction at\r\nthe return of peace to Congo (Brazzaville) following a\r\nnational dialogue involving all parties, under the\r\nauspices of the international mediator. The stability\r\nwhich has been restored to this brother country has\r\nmade possible the voluntary return of the numerous\r\nCongolese refugees from my country to their homes\r\nsince August, thanks to excellent cooperation between\r\nthe High Commissioner for Refugees, the Gabonese\r\nauthorities and the Congolese authorities. Similarly, we\r\nwelcome the significant progress that has been made in\r\nthe Burundi peace process, which on 1 November 2001\r\nculminated in the establishment of a transitional\r\ngovernment.\r\nI would like to pay deserved tribute to former\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela for the dedication and\r\ndetermination with which he conducted the process to\r\nthat important stage. For his part, the President of the\r\nGabonese Republic will, at the request of the members\r\nof the Burundi Peace Initiative, pursue his efforts with\r\na view to consolidating the peace process in that\r\ncountry.\r\nConcerning the situation in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, we welcome the important\r\nefforts already undertaken in establishing the United\r\nNations peacekeeping mission. We earnestly hope that\r\nthe Johannesburg phase will make possible the start of\r\nan effective inter-Congolese dialogue.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East, because of the\r\nthreat it presents to international peace and security, is\r\nalso a source of deep concern. I therefore urge the\r\nparties to resume negotiations, the only way to arrive at\r\na lasting peace.\r\nAt the very moment when the process of\r\nglobalization of financial markets and trade is affecting\r\nevery aspect of the life of our societies, one must\r\nrecognize that an ever-growing number of the world’s\r\npeoples risk being marginalized if concrete measures\r\nare not taken on their behalf. The international\r\ncommunity therefore needs to mobilize new and\r\nadditional resources to enable them to narrow\r\nconsiderably the gap separating them from others. The\r\nforthcoming International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, scheduled for March 2002 at Monterrey,\r\nMexico, accordingly arouses great hopes. If this\r\nimportant conference is well prepared, it will help us to\r\nsatisfy these legitimate expectations.\r\nLeaders have understood that Africa holds the\r\nkey to its own development. The creation of the\r\nAfrican Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment are part of this logic. Much remains to be\r\ndone for development to blossom, but the foundations\r\nhave already been laid. To achieve full success,\r\nhowever, Africa needs the assistance of the United\r\nNations and the international community.\r\nAnother question vital to our planet’s future at the\r\nbeginning of the third millennium is that of the\r\nprotection and preservation of the environment. The\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, which is\r\nto be held in Johannesburg from 2 to 11 September\r\n2002, will provide us a further opportunity to evaluate\r\nthe progress made in implementing policies reflecting\r\nthe commitments we undertook in Rio de Janeiro 10\r\nyears ago. What conclusions will we be able to draw as\r\nto the implementation of Agenda 21? What chance of\r\nsuccess will we be prepared to give the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the\r\nKyoto Protocol, the United Nations Convention to\r\nCombat Desertification in Those Countries\r\nExperiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification,\r\nand the Convention on Biodiversity? In other words,\r\nwhat we must do is to respond more simply and\r\ndirectly to the issue of the choices and concessions we\r\nare prepared to make to be able to pass on to future\r\ngenerations a preserved environment that is similar to\r\nthe heritage we ourselves received from our fathers.\r\nAny efforts made by the countries of Africa to\r\nensure better economic growth will be in vain if no\r\nlarge-scale effort is mounted against such diseases as\r\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and, not to be\r\nforgotten, arterial hypertension, which is another of the\r\nmain causes of death in Africa. There is therefore an\r\nurgent need to implement the United Nations\r\nrecommendations on AIDS, particularly with regard to\r\ncare, support and treatment. There is also an urgent\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nneed to make operational the special Trust Fund\r\ncreated for that purpose.\r\nAt a time when the United Nations, and in\r\nparticular the Security Council — the body primarily\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of peace in the\r\nworld — is increasingly called upon to take on the\r\nnumerous challenges posed by the third millennium,\r\nthe matter of reforming that body continues to be\r\nhighly relevant. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive how a\r\ncontinent like Africa can be without permanent\r\nrepresentation on the Council.\r\nThe reality of today’s world, divided between\r\nuniversalism and particular interests and identities,\r\nclearly illustrates that humanity is still searching for\r\nharmony and unity. That is why we are firmly\r\nconvinced that a solution to the concerns I have just\r\nmentioned is to be found in the international\r\ncommunity’s promotion of the virtues of dialogue and\r\nsolidarity, which are the pillars of the new humanism.\r\nWithout respect for those values, the dream cherished\r\nby the founders of our Organization to build a peaceful\r\nand united world will remain a chimera. Working\r\ntowards establishing a new humanity free from\r\nselfishness, hatred, passions and injustice must\r\nconstitute our common concern.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Yasser Arafat,\r\nChairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization and President of the\r\nPalestinian Authority.\r\nMr. Arafat (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): I would\r\nlike to begin by extending my congratulations to you,\r\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. I would also like to\r\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his\r\nre-election to a second term as Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations. I also wish to congratulate him and the\r\nUnited Nations on being awarded the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize.\r\nIt is important for me to be here today at this\r\nmeeting, which is being held in very critical and\r\nimportant circumstances in the aftermath of the\r\nhorrific, criminal and ugly terrorist acts against the\r\ncities of New York and Washington, D.C., on 11\r\nSeptember 2001. We strongly condemn those acts. In\r\nthis context, I would once more like to extend our\r\ndeepest and warmest sympathy to President George W.\r\nBush and to the Government and the friendly people of\r\nthe United States. In particular, I wish to express my\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims.\r\nThe Palestinian people have expressed their\r\nreadiness to confront all forms and manifestations of\r\ninternational terrorism, including State-organized\r\nterror, in order to build a new world that guarantees\r\njustice, peace, security and freedom for all peoples — a\r\nnew world based on human rights and international\r\nlegality. We call on all nations to coordinate their\r\nefforts within the framework of the United Nations and\r\ninternational legality and the need to pursue and\r\nencourage a dialogue between all nations, religions and\r\ncivilizations.\r\nI would like to express my deepest appreciation\r\nto President George W. Bush for the declaration\r\ncontained in the statement he made yesterday with\r\nregard to the need to achieve a just peace based on the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 425 (1978) and on the basis of\r\na two-State solution — Israel and Palestine — and with\r\nregard to expeditiously resuming the peace process.\r\nFor our part, we will exert every possible effort to\r\nachieve those objectives. We have worked to provide\r\nthe best possible conditions for that endeavour, and we\r\nwill continue to do so.\r\nI would also like to salute, and extend my\r\nappreciation to, all my brothers who have preceded me\r\nand clearly and eloquently made references to the\r\nquestion of the Palestinian people and their right to\r\nrealize their legitimate rights under international\r\nlegality.\r\nLast year I had the honour of addressing the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Summit. Today I am once\r\nagain addressing the Assembly, bringing the pain of the\r\nPalestinian people and their just cause, which still\r\nawaits a just solution. As Members will recall, in 1947\r\nthe General Assembly adopted resolution 181 (III),\r\nwhich provided for the partition of Palestine into two\r\nStates — one Jewish and the other Palestinian. But the\r\nPalestinian State has still not been recognized by the\r\nUnited Nations. The Palestinian people faced\r\ntremendous historic injustice, and the majority of them\r\nwere uprooted from their homes and made refugees.\r\nThe Palestinian people continue to seek their\r\nrights to self-determination and return — rights that\r\ntoday form the backbone of all relevant Security\r\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions, the\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, international\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nlaw and international humanitarian law and that should\r\nbe exercised on the Palestinian national soil. Members\r\nare aware that we have accepted the solution provided\r\nfor by international legality. Yes, we have accepted less\r\nthan 25 per cent of historic Palestine, while the General\r\nAssembly granted us almost 50 per cent of historic\r\nPalestine, as provided for in resolution 181 (III). On\r\nthis new approach, we went to the Madrid Peace\r\nConference, which was based on the principle of “land\r\nfor peace” and which had the objective of\r\nimplementing all relevant international resolutions\r\nrelated to Palestine, particularly Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425 (1978) and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) concerning the\r\nPalestinian refugees. Then we signed the Oslo\r\nAgreement at the White House in Washington, D.C., in\r\nthe presence of and witnessed by representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America, the Russian Federation, the\r\nEuropean Union, China, Japan, Egypt, Jordan and other\r\ncountries, including Arab, African, Asian and Latin\r\nAmerica States.\r\nLater we signed a number of agreements and\r\nmemorandums of understanding. After the\r\nassassination of my late partner, Mr. Yitzhak Rabin —\r\nmy partner in the peace process — consecutive Israeli\r\nGovernments clearly took the path of non-compliance\r\nand did not implement Israel’s obligations stemming\r\nfrom the signed agreements. This impeded our sincere\r\nefforts to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting\r\npeace — the peace of the brave. The number of\r\nsettlements and settlers has doubled since the start of\r\nthe peace process. This reflects the lack of seriousness\r\nof the Israeli Government and its lack of commitment\r\nto the agreements signed between us.\r\nThen came Sharon’s visit to the holy sanctuary in\r\nHoly Jerusalem. I had personally and officially warned\r\nthe Israeli Government of the grave consequences that\r\nwould have on the peace process and the region. This\r\naction sparked the Palestinian intifada, reflecting the\r\nrejection by the Palestinian people of the Israeli\r\nGovernment’s non-compliance with the agreements\r\nsigned, the settlement policies, which deepen the\r\noccupation rather than end it by withdrawing from the\r\noccupied Palestinian territory, and its policies of\r\nundermining our Christian and Muslim Holy Places.\r\nThe current Israeli Government continues the\r\naggression against the Palestinian people begun by the\r\nprevious Government. State terror is being practised\r\nagainst the Palestinian people and land, using the might\r\nof the Israeli army, including F-15s, F-16s, Apache\r\nhelicopters, tanks, missiles, armoured vehicles, navy\r\nvessels and lethal weapons, including those that are\r\ninternationally banned. Practices of the Israeli army\r\nalso include the assassination of Palestinian political\r\nleaders, the demolition of homes, the destruction of\r\nprivate and government institutions, ruining farms and\r\nfields and uprooting hundreds of thousands of olive\r\nand fruit trees, as well as the killing of women,\r\nchildren and the elderly. There have been\r\napproximately 1,800 Palestinians killed and 37,000\r\nwounded. Many of them have been handicapped for\r\nlife. Thousands have been arrested in only 13 months.\r\nIt should also be noted that the Palestinian\r\neconomy has been devastated. The losses amount to\r\n$7 billion as a result of all forms of economic,\r\nfinancial, medical and food closures and sieges\r\nimposed on all the Palestinian cities, villages and\r\nrefugee camps. These practices continue to restrict the\r\nmovement of goods and people, including students and\r\nteachers who are prevented from reaching their schools\r\nand universities. All these acts of closure and siege\r\nhave recently been tightened. Our international\r\nborders, checkpoints and airports have been closed. All\r\nthese measures violate outright basic human rights.\r\nWorkers have also been prevented from reaching their\r\nwork places, their means to sustain their families and\r\nchildren.\r\nFacing this aggression, escalation and the bloody\r\nwar of State terror being waged by the Israeli\r\nGovernment against our people, land, Holy Places, —\r\nJerusalem in particular — and Bethlehem, Beit Jala,\r\nHebron and other Palestinian towns, the incursion into\r\nour cities, villages and refugee camps with tanks and\r\nthe brutal massacres committed in various locations in\r\nthe West Bank and the Gaza Strip, we call on the\r\ninternational community, as represented by all present,\r\nand on the peace-, freedom- and justice-loving people\r\nwho defend human rights and dignity throughout the\r\nworld to work sincerely and resolutely and to exert all\r\npossible efforts to stop this war of aggression and to\r\nsend international observers to protect our people from\r\nthe occupation, terror and ethnic cleansing practised by\r\nIsrael and to supervise the implementation and the\r\nconsolidation of the ceasefire, by which we are abiding\r\nand which has been consistently violated by the Israeli\r\nGovernment.\r\nInternational sponsorship of the Middle East\r\npeace process is the only true guarantee for efforts by\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nthe international community to make peace an\r\nestablished reality in our region. The absence of\r\ninternational involvement in this conflict — in the\r\nserious search for a solution to the Palestinian question,\r\nin accordance with justice and the principles of\r\ninternational law — will push the region back into a\r\nspiral of violence, confrontation and bloodshed and\r\ncould make the situation more explosive and fragile.\r\nTherefore, I call upon the international\r\ncommunity to redouble its sincere efforts to end the\r\ncurrent situation and the escalating crisis that, in the\r\nabsence of the peace process, threatens to explode,\r\nwith grave consequences for our region. The active\r\ninvolvement of the international community and the\r\ninfluential Great Powers is essential to save the peace\r\nprocess and to put it back on the right track, to move it\r\nforward sincerely, resolutely and effectively. Lasting\r\npeace will not be achieved or sustained without\r\ninternational legality to provide an effective and\r\nbinding international mechanism to implement the\r\nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly\r\nresolutions. The accurate and honest implementation of\r\nthese resolutions will establish and sustain peace and\r\nwill prevent bloodshed in our region.\r\nProceeding from our belief in peace as an\r\nirreversible strategic choice of our people, we have\r\ncooperated fully and positively with all international\r\nefforts and initiatives, including the Egyptian-\r\nJordanian initiative, the Tenet Understandings and the\r\nMitchell Report, which we accepted as a\r\ncomprehensive, integrated package. We have also\r\nunilaterally declared an immediate comprehensive\r\nceasefire, and we have exerted maximum efforts to\r\nsustain that ceasefire. On the eve of the Jewish New\r\nYear, we initiated the Palestinian call for peace, offered\r\nour sincere congratulations to the Israeli people and\r\ncalled upon them to make the New Year an occasion\r\nfor a new era of peace, security and peaceful\r\ncoexistence between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples\r\nand the peoples of the whole Middle East region. We\r\nmade very clear and unequivocal our strategic\r\ncommitment to peace, negotiations and the political\r\nsolution to all outstanding issues between us and the\r\nGovernment of Israel.\r\nMost regrettably, the Israeli Government\r\ninstructed its war generals and army to escalate the\r\nmilitary campaign against our people, cities, villages\r\nand refugee camps. This included the buffer zones and\r\nthe siege that closed off wide areas of cities, villages\r\nand cultivated lands and led to the destruction of our\r\nfarms and the uprooting of thousands of trees in\r\nvarious places in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\r\nAllow me to extend my deepest appreciation and\r\nto salute sincerely all the brotherly, friendly nations\r\nand to the Great Powers that have realized today, more\r\nthan ever before, that the establishment of an\r\nindependent Palestinian State, with Holy Jerusalem as\r\nits capital, is the only guarantee for peace, security and\r\nstability in the region and the world. This constitutes a\r\nbasic cornerstone in establishing and sustaining that\r\npeace.\r\nWe call upon these nations, particularly the\r\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, the Russian\r\nFederation, France, China, Japan, the members of the\r\nEuropean Union and the non-aligned countries, the\r\ninternational community, individually and collectively,\r\nto exert every possible effort to translate this vision\r\ninto action and political reality in order to enable the\r\nPalestinian people to live in peace, dignity, freedom,\r\nindependence and sovereignty within their independent\r\nState on their national soil, with Holy Jerusalem as its\r\ncapital. This can be achieved by bringing Israel, the\r\noccupying Power, to withdraw fully from all of the\r\noccupied Palestinian and Arab territories, including\r\nHoly Jerusalem, to the boundaries of 4 June 1967, in\r\naccordance with the principles of the Madrid Peace\r\nConference, to end settlement activities and evacuate\r\nsettlers from our land, and to guarantee the right of\r\nreturn to the Palestinian refugees, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III), which provided\r\nfor this right and called for compensation to those not\r\nwishing to return.\r\nWe welcome the positive positions taken by\r\nPresident George W. Bush and other leaders who have\r\ncalled for the establishment of a Palestinian State. We\r\nbelieve this constitutes a significant step towards\r\nending the conflict and establishing peace in the\r\nMiddle East. I will say candidly to you that reviving\r\nand completing the peace process will need a new\r\nqualitative push, and after all that has happened it will\r\nnot be possible to confine ourselves to interim\r\nsolutions. It is impossible, of course, to achieve another\r\ninterim agreement, as called for by some. To control\r\nthe situation on the ground and to get the situation back\r\nto the way it existed before 28 September 2000\r\nrequires clear political imagination and new hope.\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.46\r\nWhat the peace process now requires to achieve a\r\njust and lasting peace is a genuine effort on the part of\r\nthe co-sponsors of the peace process — the United\r\nStates and the Russian Federation — as well as\r\ninfluential international actors, including the European\r\nUnion, and of course the Arab and Muslim countries\r\nand other friendly nations in the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement as well as in the United Nations. All of\r\nthem should immediately introduce a comprehensive\r\nframework for a permanent final solution based on\r\ninternational legality and the agreements signed so that\r\nboth parties can negotiate expeditiously the details of\r\nthat permanent solution. This, of course, should be\r\npreceded by the full and immediate implementation of\r\nthe Mitchell Report and the Tenet Understandings.\r\nIt is clear that we are in need of greater\r\ninternational efforts, including an international\r\npresence on the ground, to help the parties move\r\nforward. In any case, the United Nations and the\r\nSecretary-General must carry out their natural and\r\nimportant roles in this regard so that we can achieve\r\nour desired peace objectives. I call upon the Israeli\r\nGovernment and the Israeli people to respond\r\npositively to this approach so that we can together\r\nbuild peace in the land of peace, the Holy Land of\r\npeace — the Holy Land; I repeat, the Holy Land.\r\nNeedless to say, we need an expeditious effort\r\nthat brooks no further delay, especially at the current\r\ninternational situation. We are ready to carry out our\r\nshare of responsibility. We trust you are also ready to\r\nshoulder your share of responsibility. I realize that the\r\ninternational community, after the assassination of my\r\npartner, Yitzhak Rabin, is looking forward to the peace\r\nprocess. From here I convey to the Israeli people my\r\nfull commitment to the peace process, which I began\r\nwith my late partner Yitzhak Rabin, and my partner\r\nShimon Peres, a peace that guarantees freedom,\r\nstability and security for the Israelis and the\r\nPalestinians and all the peoples in the Middle East\r\nregion — the peace of the brave; the just and\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace that will end the\r\nIsraeli occupation of all the Palestinian and Arab\r\nterritories and will lead to the establishment of the\r\nindependent Palestinian State with Holy Jerusalem as\r\nits capital.\r\nThis is what we should be working for, for the\r\nsake of our children and their children. From here I call\r\nupon the Israeli Government to resume the final status\r\nnegotiations in order to implement the resolutions of\r\ninternational legality and the agreements signed.\r\nI salute all of you and hope that this session will\r\nproduce the required solutions and recommendations\r\nwhich will enable our peoples and our nations and the\r\nwhole of humanity to live in peace, stability, progress\r\nand prosperity.\r\nMay peace and God’s blessing be with you.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
