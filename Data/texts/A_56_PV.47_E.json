(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, President\r\nof the Republic of Guatemala\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guatemala.\r\nMr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Portillo Cabrera (spoke in Spanish):\r\nLet me first condemn the monstrous attack on the\r\npeople and the Government of our host country. In\r\ncondemning it in the strongest possible terms, we\r\ndeclare ourselves in full solidarity with the people and\r\nthe Government of the United States, the families of\r\neach and every one of the victims, whatever his or her\r\nnationality, and the residents of this great city of New\r\nYork. We also associate ourselves unreservedly with\r\nthe resolutions adopted last month by the Assembly\r\nand the Security Council. We will carry on in our\r\ncommitment to the elimination of terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations.\r\nBefore taking up our Government programme and\r\nthe fulfilment of the Peace Agreements, and our\r\nposition on certain of the items on the agenda for this\r\nsession, I wish to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. I have no doubt that your well-proven\r\ncapabilities and your recognized wisdom will enable\r\nyou to bring our deliberations to a fully successful\r\noutcome.\r\nI wish further to join the representatives who\r\nhave taken the floor before me in commending the\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nfor his wise leadership. We hail his well-deserved re-\r\nelection and rejoice at the recognition that both he and\r\nthe Organization have received, through the award of\r\nthe Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nI come, like many of those gathered here, from a\r\nsmall country that mirrors the grave problems facing\r\ntoday’s world. Today we still do not enjoy the major\r\nbenefits of the great scientific and technological\r\nadvances, and we still suffer from great social\r\ninequalities. Ours is a small country that is doing its\r\nbest to attain peace and democracy — a country that\r\nbelieves in the rewards of economic freedom, but also\r\nin social justice. It is a country that has opened itself\r\nup to the world, although the world has perhaps not\r\nopened itself up reciprocally in the same way. It is a\r\ncountry that works and produces by making great\r\nefforts but that, in the present circumstances, is\r\nreceiving less and less for those efforts.\r\nIn this context, our contribution to world peace\r\nand democracy is diminished to the same extent that\r\ninequality, social injustice and poverty imperil our\r\npeace and our democracy.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nToday the struggle against terrorism is the\r\nstruggle against inequality in international economic\r\nrelations; it is the struggle against ignorance, injustice,\r\ndiscrimination, intolerance, exclusion and poverty.\r\nThere will be no peace if we do not eradicate these\r\nscourges. A peace that goes hand in hand with\r\ninequality, poverty and injustice is a bad peace. And let\r\nus not forget that a bad peace is worse than war.\r\nWe are making strenuous efforts to advance in\r\nimplementing our own Peace Agreements, which\r\ncoincide with our Government programme. The time\r\nthat has elapsed since I addressed the Millennium\r\nSummit has witnessed intensive activities. I can point\r\nto significant progress, but I must also admit to some\r\nsetbacks, which are due primarily to an unfavourable\r\ninternational environment, which has affected the\r\neconomy in an extremely adverse way. I draw attention\r\nto this situation, because full compliance with the\r\ncommitments contained in the Peace Agreements\r\nwould be far easier in a context of economic growth\r\nthan in the framework of serious fiscal restrictions and\r\nincreasing demands on the Government.\r\nOn a different matter, I would like to comment\r\nbriefly on the United Nations presence in Guatemala. I\r\nwish to reiterate how much we appreciate the United\r\nNations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA). We trust that its mandate will be\r\nextended until the end of 2003 so that we can in a\r\nprogressive and orderly way transfer its functions both\r\nto national institutions and, wherever possible, to the\r\nUnited Nations programmes and agencies.\r\nAs far as our international relations are\r\nconcerned, I would like to mention the significant\r\nprogress made in the process of finding a peaceful\r\nresolution to the historical dispute between ourselves\r\nand Belize. In keeping with the principles of peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes between States, we have\r\nconfirmed with deeds our commitment to dialogue as\r\nthe way of settling disputes. The commission of\r\nfacilitators appointed last year, within the framework\r\nof the regional organization to which both States\r\nbelong, the Organization of American States, will soon\r\nsubmit its report. Its fundamental aim is to work out\r\nand prepare courses of action to make progress in\r\nresolving the dispute.\r\nWe reiterate our firm support for Central\r\nAmerican integration and our commitment to the rest\r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean. Our Government\r\nhas supported major initiatives in the area of regional\r\nand subregional integration, and is working hard to\r\novercome problems left over from age-old border\r\ndisputes in Central America.\r\nAs to our position on other international conflicts,\r\nwe voice the hope that the differences or divisions that\r\npersist between fraternal peoples in the Middle East,\r\nAsia and Africa will yield to resolution peacefully\r\nthrough dialogue. I also wish to take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate before this Assembly our concern over the\r\nsituation of the 23 million citizens of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan, whose aspiration to be represented in\r\ninternational organizations has not yet been fully\r\nsatisfied. The Central American countries in general,\r\nand Guatemala in particular, believe they could indeed\r\nmake a positive contribution to peace and democracy in\r\nthe world.\r\nI would now like to comment briefly on our\r\nviews regarding the principal issues with which this\r\nAssembly will have to deal at the current session. First,\r\nI reiterate our full support for the United Nations as the\r\nsupreme expression of multilateralism. We are\r\nconvinced that the United Nations will have a crucial\r\nrole to play in the twenty-first century. It is our view\r\nthat the Millennium Declaration that our heads of State\r\nand Government issued a year ago offers the right\r\nagenda for our priorities and for the steps to be taken to\r\nattain the goals set.\r\nSecond, we agree that it is necessary to adapt the\r\nOrganization to the exigencies of globalization and to\r\nthis post-cold-war era. It is up to us, the Member\r\nGovernments, to further this process of adaptation in\r\nvarious areas, such as intergovernmental forums, the\r\nefficiency and efficacy of the Secretariat, the setting of\r\npriorities in shaping the programme of activities and\r\nthe financial strengthening of the Organization.\r\nThird, of the pending reforms, the one that has\r\nreceived the most attention is that concerning the\r\nSecurity Council. One cannot but be frustrated at the\r\nlimited progress made in this area at previous sessions\r\nof the General Assembly. Now more than ever before\r\nwe must redouble our efforts to endow that body with\r\ngreater efficacy, broader representativity and more\r\ntransparency in its working procedures. To achieve\r\nthese objectives, we advocate, inter alia, an increase in\r\nthe number of Council members, as well as a very\r\nsparse use of the veto power. We also believe that now\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nmore than ever before it is necessary that the Security\r\nCouncil’s work be monitored by the General Assembly.\r\nFourth, deeply shocked by the events that\r\noccurred in this country on 11 September, we reiterate\r\nour full and complete opposition to terrorism, and we\r\nwill support any collective action by the international\r\ncommunity to combat this scourge. As a matter of fact,\r\nwe are already working to comply with the spirit and\r\nthe letter of the undertakings embodied in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), within the parameters\r\nof a democratic society that aspires to guarantee the\r\nhuman rights of its members.\r\nFifth, we advocate the strengthening of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and we congratulate the President\r\nof its fifty-fifth session on his initiative to revitalize its\r\nworking methods and procedures. We trust that this\r\naction will continue under the current presidency and\r\nthat it will extend to the wider task of reforming the\r\nAssembly, in pursuance of the aims of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nSixth, we are convinced of the need to strengthen\r\nour collective capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts,\r\nboth between States and at the national level. We\r\nbelieve that the report of the Panel on United Nations\r\nPeace Operations provides an adequate basis for\r\nachieving this purpose.\r\nSeventh, as regards general disarmament, we\r\ninsist on the need for progress towards the total\r\nelimination of nuclear, chemical and bacteriological\r\nweapons, the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons, and the use of anti-personnel mines and other\r\nexplosive devices. In this connection, we support all\r\nconcrete actions by the United Nations to accomplish\r\nthese aims, including those that look to the\r\nestablishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in all\r\nregions of the world. As regards the control of illicit\r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons, we are of the\r\nview that the results of the Conference held last July to\r\ndeal with this problem, while positive if allowance is\r\nmade for this being the first step taken at the global\r\nlevel to deal with the matter, are nevertheless\r\ninadequate.\r\nEighth, we offer our full support for and active\r\nparticipation in the principal meetings scheduled for\r\nthe years ahead, among which I wish to highlight the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, next\r\nMarch, as well as the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Johannesburg.\r\nNinth, in a world characterized by ever greater\r\ninterdependence, multilateral diplomacy plays a crucial\r\nrole in the fight against environmental degradation.\r\nGuatemala, as a party to the main international treaties\r\nrelating to the environment, reiterates its commitment\r\nto the maintenance of ecological balance.\r\nFinally, we consider that the United Nations\r\nshould continue devoting itself to what we call the\r\ngreat unfinished business of the twentieth century —\r\nnamely, the elimination of world poverty. Together\r\nwith the multilateral financial agencies, our\r\nOrganization should play a crucial role in ensuring that\r\nthe benefits of globalization are widely shared among\r\nall countries, not only among a few of them; this\r\nrequires action at the level of each country and at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nGiven the globalization process the world is\r\ngoing through, we must recognize, as stated by the\r\ngreat Mexican thinker Carlos Fuentes, that unregulated\r\nglobalization leads to more profound economic and\r\nsocial imbalance. We cannot turn economic policy into\r\na mere balancing of accounts in which human beings\r\nand populations are not taken into consideration. How\r\ncan we make demands on some countries when those\r\ndemands are not made of others in similar conditions?\r\nCivilization is being put to the test. The question\r\nis how to eliminate the universal threat posed by\r\nterrorism and at the same time maintain and renew the\r\nethical, political, legal and social bases for ensuring\r\ncoexistence in a globalized world. The only solution is\r\nto focus on fighting for more freedom, more\r\ndemocracy, more tolerance and more justice. In this\r\nrespect, I would like to share with the Assembly the\r\nwords of a distinguished Guatemalan poet, Otto René\r\nCastillo:\r\n“We have suffered in so many places the blows of\r\nthe executioner and written his name so many\r\ntimes on so little skin, that we cannot die, for\r\nliberty has no death”.\r\nMay God bless and protect us.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Guatemala for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alfonso Portillo Cabrera, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guatemala, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber\r\nAl-Sabah, Acting Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the State of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Acting\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nState of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah,\r\nActing Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the State of Kuwait, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have\r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad\r\nAl-Jaber Al-Sabah, Acting Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the State of Kuwait, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah\r\n(spoke in Arabic): On behalf of the State of Kuwait, it\r\ngives me pleasure to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\nand his friendly country, the Republic of Korea, on his\r\nelection as President of the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The office he holds undoubtedly\r\ncarries enormous responsibility. My delegation offers\r\nhim all the support and cooperation he needs to fulfil\r\nhis mandate. I wish here to pay tribute to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his efficient\r\nstewardship of the last session of the Assembly.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to warmly\r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan, jointly\r\nwith the United Nations, on the well-deserved award of\r\nthe Nobel Peace Prize, and on his unprecedented early\r\nre-election to a second term. The renewal of Mr.\r\nAnnan’s mandate by the international community\r\nreflects deep confidence in his character and\r\ncapabilities, in addition to recognition of his past\r\nrecord. We look forward to continuing to see him bring\r\ninto play his creative perspective in addressing a whole\r\narray of complete and interrelated issues facing our\r\nworld.\r\nMany of the questions and challenges facing our\r\ncountries nowadays involve implications and risks that\r\ncut across national borders of sovereign countries. It is\r\nlittle wonder that our world has become a smaller\r\nplanet where geographical boundaries, cultural\r\ndiversity, economic status and ethnic multiplicity have\r\nbecome lesser factors in shielding communities against\r\nglobal influences and, by the same token, have\r\nprovided larger platforms for interaction with others.\r\nThe fact that the world community is now seized with\r\nfighting terrorism is perhaps yet further compelling and\r\nclear evidence of the deep interaction among and\r\ncomplexity of States’ interests and concerns. The\r\nstrong condemnation of the heinous terrorist acts\r\ncommitted against the United States of America on 11\r\nSeptember 2001 reflects the international community’s\r\nrecognition that the real target of that assault is the\r\npolitical, economic and social stability of the world\r\norder. Indeed, those attacks affected, without\r\ndiscrimination, virtually all nation States, all\r\ncontinents, all civilizations, all religions and all races.\r\nKuwait, for its part, has had a long-standing and\r\nfirm position of total and unequivocal condemnation of\r\nterrorism, irrespective of its form or manifestation.\r\nThus, only hours after the commission of those\r\ncriminal acts, which contravene and violate every\r\nreligious concept and every cultural and humanitarian\r\nvalue system, the Government and people of Kuwait\r\ncondemned them. I wish to reiterate here our deep\r\nsympathies and condolences to the bereaved families\r\nand to the friendly people of the United States of\r\nAmerica. Let me reaffirm our full backing and support\r\nfor all the efforts and measures adopted by the\r\ninternational coalition to destroy the dens and bases of\r\nterrorism with a view to stamping out its roots, to\r\napprehend the perpetrators of these criminal acts and to\r\nbring them to justice. In this regard, we call for the\r\ncompletion of work on the development of a rigorous\r\ninternational legal system with which all countries of\r\nthe world would comply in good faith to eradicate this\r\nevil.\r\nIn compliance with Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), Kuwait has enacted specific measures to\r\nplug any loopholes that might be abused in charitable\r\nfund-raising activities and to ensure that any charity\r\nasset is used solely and exclusively for its original\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nlegitimate purposes. Our competent authorities are now\r\nin the process of taking further enforcement measures\r\nto ensure universal and strict compliance.\r\nAt a time when we condemn all acts of terrorism,\r\nwe have been truly surprised to hear some voices that\r\nhave started to mount intense and relentless campaigns\r\nlinking terrorism with Islam. Those allegations\r\nrepresent an obvious mistreatment of and injustice to a\r\ndivine faith revealed by God Almighty to humankind to\r\nensure mercy and compassion on this planet. Islam is a\r\nfaith that advocates peace, calls for tolerance, promotes\r\namity and renounces bigotry and extremism. Suffice it\r\nto cite one verse from The Holy Koran:\r\n“Invite (all) to the Way\r\nOf thy Lord with wisdom\r\nAnd beautiful preaching” (The Holy Koran,\r\nXVI:125)\r\nTherefore, we really cannot accept these tendencies in\r\nthe domestic or international mass media, regardless of\r\nany excuse or pretext. Indeed, it is our common\r\nresponsibility to challenge such pernicious campaigns\r\nin the interest of global social harmony.\r\nAn effective fight against terrorism requires\r\nmaximum international cooperation and coordination.\r\nIt also demands a soul-searching review of our\r\npolitical, economic and social policies and practices in\r\ndealing with current global challenges. The aim is to\r\ndeny evil-doers any reason to carry out their terror\r\nschemes to advance their own agendas.\r\nWhile we stress the importance and relevance of\r\nall United Nations resolutions and instruments relating\r\nto the suppression of terrorism, Kuwait endorses the\r\ncall to convene an international conference on\r\nterrorism. A key purpose of that proposed meeting\r\nwould be to set out a clear definition of terrorism that\r\ndraws a line between terrorism as a phenomenon that\r\nstrikes at international peace and security and the right\r\nof peoples to struggle against occupation with a view\r\nto achieving self-determination, in line with the Charter\r\nof the United Nations and the norms of international\r\nlaw.\r\nKuwait is in full sympathy with the friendly\r\npeople of Afghanistan, who have endured a great and\r\nsteady decline in their living conditions for over 20\r\nyears. The relentless conflicts and wars that have\r\nafflicted Afghanistan for too long have destroyed the\r\ninfrastructure and resources of that country. In response\r\nto the appeal of the Secretary-General seeking\r\nresources to meet the severe humanitarian crisis of the\r\nAfghan people, the Government of Kuwait has\r\nannounced a donation of $3 million in support of\r\ninternational humanitarian relief efforts. Three\r\nshipments of relief aid have also been sent to the\r\nAfghan refugees. These supplies are distributed in\r\ncoordination with the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. Furthermore, back\r\nin Kuwait, we are organizing a public fund-raising\r\ncampaign to solicit donations from individuals and\r\nprivate companies to alleviate the suffering of the\r\nAfghan people. The total yield of that effort now stands\r\nat over $8 million.\r\nWith regard to the overall situation in\r\nAfghanistan, Kuwait maintains that international\r\nefforts should be maximized to bring about the long-\r\nawaited peace and security. National reconciliation and\r\na national coalition Government, elected by the people\r\nof Afghanistan, that represent all factions and ethnic\r\ngroups are perhaps the most viable means to ensure the\r\nsustainability of the country and eventually its recovery\r\nof normal status within the region and the world. Only\r\nthen will the nation of Afghanistan be able to channel\r\nits energy and resources towards reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the meantime, while we express our deep\r\nregret for the civilian casualties among the Afghan\r\npopulation, we sincerely hope that the ongoing military\r\noperations against the bastions of terrorism and the\r\nterrorists will cause no injuries to innocent, unarmed\r\npeople who are totally powerless and helpless.\r\nKuwait views the environment as a key common\r\nheritage and destiny that must be preserved for future\r\ngenerations. The bitter recent experience of the Gulf\r\nregion, where two devastating wars took place, has left\r\nwide-scale environmental damage. Against this\r\nbackground, Kuwait sponsored a draft resolution\r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly to designate\r\n6 November of each year as the International Day for\r\nPreventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War\r\nand Armed Conflict. Kuwait is grateful that the\r\nresolution was adopted by consensus. It is our hope\r\nthat this initiative will help to further promote a deeper\r\nuniversal awareness of the need to safeguard our\r\nenvironment, which is the source of human life now\r\nand in the future.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nThe eyes of the world have been fixed for over\r\none year now on the valiant uprising of the Palestinian\r\npeople, which arose as a natural and legitimate\r\nresponse to the continued Israeli occupation of the\r\nPalestinian territories and to the backtracking of the\r\nIsraeli Government from the accords it signed with the\r\nPalestinian side.\r\nThe obvious policy of the Government of Israel is\r\nto reject any Palestinian, regional or international\r\ninitiative. Instead, it counts as a matter of policy on the\r\nuse of force; state terrorism and the creation of faits\r\naccomplis on the ground. It slams every door that is\r\nopened, designs new oppressive measures and triggers\r\none crisis after another. Its overriding goal is to abort\r\nthe peace promise born in Madrid in 1991. Israel’s\r\nbarbaric practices, its blatant challenge to all United\r\nNations resolutions and its excessive and unwarranted\r\nuse of lethal force in response to stone-throwing\r\nPalestinians have all combined to create an\r\noverwhelming sense of despair, frustration and gloom\r\nin the Palestinian ranks.\r\nHere one must ponder the hard lessons we have\r\nall learned from similar situations of unalloyed gloom\r\nand doom. It is precisely against this backdrop that the\r\nUnited Nations, the international community and the\r\nUnited States in particular, as a co-sponsor of the\r\nMiddle East peace process, must assume a special\r\ninternational responsibility to mount an effective and\r\nmeaningful drive to force Israel to fulfil its\r\nundertakings and commitments set forth in its bilateral\r\nagreements with the Palestinian Authority, as well as to\r\nimplement Security Council and General Assembly\r\nresolutions, including those relating to the city of\r\nJerusalem, with a view to preserving its Arab and\r\nIslamic character and its holy religious identity. Kuwait\r\ntherefore welcomes the indications of support by the\r\nUnited States for the establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State. We hope that this declared position\r\nwill now be translated into concrete steps that will\r\nmove the whole peace process forward towards its\r\nlong-awaited outcome.\r\nIn this context, let me stress that Kuwait will\r\ncontinue to support our Palestinian brothers and to\r\nprovide all possible political and material assistance to\r\nthem until they attain all their legitimate political\r\nrights, including the establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State on their own territory, with Jerusalem\r\nas its capital. In the same vein, Israel must\r\nunconditionally withdraw from the Syrian Arab Golan\r\nand the Lebanese Shab’a farms.\r\nThe main objective of Kuwait’s foreign policy is\r\nto consolidate security and stability throughout the\r\nArabian Gulf region. This goal will remain unmet\r\nunless and until Iraq implements all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. It is, indeed, regrettable that the\r\nGovernment of Iraq persists in its allegations that it has\r\ncarried out all its obligations under those resolutions.\r\nIn addition, that Government continues to pursue its\r\nlong-standing hostile practices and policies towards\r\nKuwait in order to heighten regional tension and to\r\ndestabilize security and peace. Kuwait has repeatedly\r\ndrawn the attention of the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General to the non-peaceful intentions of\r\nIraq, as exemplified by the recurrent threats made to\r\nKuwait’s security and sovereignty by many high-level\r\nIraqi Government officials. Kuwait has also called on\r\nthe Security Council to bring pressure to bear on the\r\nIraqi Government so that it will honour all its\r\nobligations and thereby make it possible to lift the\r\nsanctions affecting the brotherly people of Iraq and to\r\npermit that country to reclaim its normal status as an\r\nactive member regionally and internationally.\r\nWhen we discuss here the suffering of children,\r\nwomen and the elderly, Kuwait cannot but recall its\r\nown excruciating experience, endured over the past\r\ndecade, relating to the question of Kuwaiti and third-\r\ncountry prisoners and hostages. In fact, this is a key\r\nobligation that Iraq has so far failed to fulfil. This issue\r\nremains a top national priority for the Government and\r\npeople of Kuwait.\r\nThe humanitarian nature of this long-running\r\nissue — the anguish that it is causing to the immediate\r\nfamilies of the prisoners and to our entire\r\npopulation — means that resolution of the problem\r\ncannot be delayed any longer. The Government of Iraq\r\nalone bears responsibility for the lack of any\r\nmeaningful progress in implementing the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Those resolutions\r\ndemand, inter alia, that Iraq cooperate with the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and the high-\r\nlevel Coordinator, Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov, who\r\nwas appointed by the Secretary-General to facilitate the\r\nreturn of those prisoners and hostages. It is clear that\r\nthe Government of Iraq is insensitive to the\r\nhumanitarian dimension of this matter. This\r\ninsensitivity is borne out by its insistence on\r\nboycotting the meetings of the ad hoc Tripartite\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nCommission and its Technical Subcommittee since it\r\nwalked away from those meetings for unjustifiable\r\npolitical reasons in January 1999. Let me also reiterate\r\nour call to Iraq to return our stolen property, in\r\nparticular the State of Kuwait archives and other\r\nofficial documents.\r\nOver the past few years, the world economic\r\nscene has undergone remarkable changes. We have\r\nseen the emergence of several new economic\r\nphenomena created by the revolution in information\r\ntechnology and the immense scientific progress in\r\ncommunications and trade. These changes and\r\nphenomena have made it imperative for many\r\ncountries, especially the developing nations, to\r\nintroduce drastic changes to their economic plans and\r\nstructures in an attempt to benefit from the globalized\r\neconomy with a view to ensuring development and\r\nprogress for their societies. Despite the promise of\r\nsubstantial benefits as a result of policies to liberalize\r\nworld trade and eliminate customs barriers, we still\r\nhave to make a concerted effort in order to make the\r\nglobalization process a positive force that benefits all\r\nthe peoples of the world. This will require the drawing\r\nup of regional and international guidelines and\r\nstandards that protect the nascent economies of the\r\ndeveloping nations from economic turbulence and\r\ncrises that might otherwise have an adverse impact on\r\nthe living conditions of their peoples.\r\nIn the meantime, the developed countries and the\r\ninternational financial institutions should double their\r\nfinancial aid to the developing countries in order to\r\nenable them to strengthen the underpinnings of their\r\neconomic structures. In the long term, this will help to\r\nestablish more balanced economic relations built on\r\nmutual benefit and common interest. With that in mind,\r\nKuwait is pursuing a steadfast policy of support for\r\ndevelopmental projects in many developing countries.\r\nMost recently, Kuwait has contributed $1 million to the\r\nfund established by the Secretary-General to combat\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nOn a parallel track, Kuwait is contributing to the\r\nfunding of many developmental programmes and\r\nprojects in the developing countries through\r\ninternational and regional financial institutions, as well\r\nas through many public Kuwaiti charitable\r\norganizations. This philanthropy is motivated by a\r\nsense of common social responsibility and social\r\ninterdependence — values that are embedded in the\r\ntraditions of our Islamic faith.\r\nLet me close by saying that we look forward to\r\nparticipating actively in the forthcoming celebrations\r\nof the Year of Dialogue among Civilizations.\r\nHopefully, this will turn out to be another event that\r\nunderscores our determination to promote and\r\nconsolidate the concepts of civilized tolerance and\r\nunderstanding among our nations and peoples, who all\r\nyearn to live free of self-inflicted conflicts and to enjoy\r\na prosperous life in which good and virtuous human\r\ntendencies prevail as a basis for international relations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nActing Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof the State of Kuwait for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah,\r\nActing Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the State of Kuwait, was escorted from\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Tuilaepa Malielegaoi,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Independent State of Samoa\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Independent State of Samoa.\r\nThe Honourable Tuilaepa Malielegaoi, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted into\r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency The Honourable Tuilaepa\r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Independent State of Samoa, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nI apologize to the Prime Minister for the change\r\nin the order of speakers.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): Samoa is very pleased\r\nthat we are meeting under the presidency of Mr. Han.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I extend warm\r\ncongratulations to the President of the General\r\nAssembly and express to him our full confidence and\r\ncooperation.\r\nAllow me also a moment to pay tribute to his\r\npredecessor, President Harri Holkeri, for his\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\noutstanding service and leadership during the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and for the\r\nsignificant achievements of that session.\r\nWe are delighted with the award of the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nand to our Organization. I want, in particular, to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General and to wish him\r\nevery success in his new term of office. His personal\r\nqualities and extraordinary leadership give shape to the\r\nmodern face of the United Nations in ways that give\r\nforce and credibility to the Organization and its\r\nperformance.\r\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September marked a\r\nturning point in the history of our era. These terrible\r\nevents give special significance to this session of the\r\nAssembly. We need to send out from this house an\r\nunambiguous message.\r\nThe clear view of my Government is that there is\r\nno room for moral equivocation. The deliberate taking\r\nof innocent civilian life, regardless of cause or\r\ngrievance, is without justification in law and is morally\r\nunacceptable. My Government has declared its strong\r\ncondemnation of the attacks in New York, Washington,\r\nD.C., and Pennsylvania, and I want today to underscore\r\nthat condemnation in unequivocal terms.\r\nOn behalf of my country and its citizens, I want\r\nto renew to the Government and the people of the\r\nUnited States our profound feelings of sorrow and\r\nsympathy and our committed solidarity and support. I\r\nalso want to say that the leadership, magnificent\r\nexample and courage shown by the United States\r\ndemonstrate beyond doubt the extraordinary strengths\r\nof that great democracy and the indomitable spirit of its\r\npeople.\r\nThis was a most monstrous crime, evil in\r\npremeditation and merciless in execution. Thousands\r\nof innocent lives were taken, thousands of people\r\nmurdered without warning. To the families and friends\r\nof the victims — which included citizens of many other\r\ncountries represented in this Hall — we extend our\r\nwarm and heartfelt condolences.\r\nTerrorism is an offence against the core values of\r\nthe United Nations. It is a direct and most serious\r\nthreat to democracy, to the free exercise of human\r\nrights and to economic and social development. It has\r\nno respect for social order, human life and property.\r\nThis has never been clearer than in the aftermath\r\nof these terrible attacks against the United States.\r\nFurthermore, these horrific events not only have served\r\nto highlight the need for a concerted and effective\r\ninternational response but have also drawn attention to\r\nthe inadequacy of the traditional forms of judicial and\r\nlaw enforcement in combating it.\r\nThere cannot be any question as to the need for\r\nan effective response from the international\r\ncommunity. Indeed, the Security Council’s unanimous\r\nand momentous resolution 1373 (2001), together with\r\nresolution 1368 (2001), gives the clearest signal of the\r\ninternational community’s determination to take\r\nconcrete action against the financing, training and\r\nmovement of terrorists and the need for all States to\r\ncooperate in any campaign against them. We believe\r\nthey provide the necessary basis for securing the\r\nbroadest possible international support and cooperation\r\nfor the global campaign against terrorism, in particular\r\nthrough the work of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.\r\nI am pleased to announce that as part of its own\r\nresponse in this collective effort, Samoa is taking steps\r\nto adhere to additional United Nations conventions on\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nWe believe, however, that we need to bear in\r\nmind that fighting terrorism cannot be separated from\r\nthe task of preventing organized crime and the spread\r\nof small arms and other weapons, and of containing\r\nand ending conflict. We also need to ensure that the\r\nconditions of poverty and despair, which breed\r\nignorance, hatred, violence and extremism, are\r\nproperly and effectively addressed.\r\nWe need, above all, to remain resolute in\r\nupholding the rule of law and the principles that\r\nunderpin the rule of law. The clear affirmation of these\r\nprinciples and of the norms of humanitarian and\r\ninternational law will help deny to the perpetrators of\r\nthese crimes whatever they seek to gain from violence.\r\nWe consider it essential to renew efforts to\r\npromote the rapid entry into force of the Rome Statute\r\nof the International Criminal Court. A functioning\r\ninternational criminal court for the prosecution of\r\nterrorist acts amounting to crimes against humanity —\r\nas we consider the attacks on the United States to be —\r\nwould provide a vital component in the international\r\narmoury against terrorism.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nThis fifty-sixth session of the Assembly is the\r\nfirst to follow last year’s Millennium Summit. It will\r\nbe the ideal occasion to take up the critical issues and\r\nstrategies for implementing the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. May I say in this connection that we\r\nwarmly welcome and find most useful the road map\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, setting out in some\r\ndetail how the Summit commitments could be fulfilled.\r\nWe note that most of the targets set by the\r\nMillennium Declaration are not really new. They are\r\nthe determined results of global conferences of the\r\n1990s or are derived from the body of international\r\nnorms and laws that have been codified over the past\r\n50 years. It follows that the plans of action needed for\r\nreaching the targets have, for the most part, already\r\nbeen developed and formally adopted by Member\r\nStates.\r\nWhat is needed, therefore, is not more technical\r\nor feasibility studies. Rather, as the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport points out, States need to demonstrate the\r\npolitical will to carry out commitments already made\r\nand to implement strategies already worked out. In\r\nother words, as we move from an era of commitment to\r\nan era of implementation, the international community\r\nmust mobilize the will and the resources needed to\r\nfulfil the promises made.\r\nSamoa was honoured recently to host a Pacific\r\nregional meeting as part of the preparatory work for the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in\r\nJohannesburg next September. It is important to seek\r\nfurther progress in these preparations, especially in the\r\ncompletion of national assessment reports. We believe\r\nthe Summit will be a unique opportunity to re-establish\r\ninternational commitment to sustainable development.\r\nOur own view is that there is a need to accelerate the\r\ncomprehensive and targeted implementation of Agenda\r\n21. Efforts to this end should aim to minimize and\r\nremove obstacles that impede the implementation of\r\nthe Rio commitments, especially in capacity-building\r\nneeds and in the provision of adequate financial and\r\ntechnological support.\r\nWe place particular importance on the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment. The agenda of the Conference allows for\r\na full range of substantive issues to be addressed. It\r\nwould be important to forge broad-based consensus on\r\nall these issues, and even more so on the reform of the\r\ninternational financial and trade architecture in a way\r\nthat would be supportive of the long-term development\r\nof developing countries. There should be enhanced\r\nopportunities for the representation and participation of\r\ndeveloping countries, including small island States, in\r\nthe major decision-making institutions on global\r\nfinancing, monetary and trade issues.\r\nIt is impossible today to visualize progress and\r\ndevelopment without access to modern information\r\nsystems. The remarkable growth of information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICT) is opening up\r\nboundless new possibilities for accelerated economic\r\nand social development. But the ability to translate the\r\nfull potential of ICT differs from country to country. I\r\nknow my country needs to develop its own capacity to\r\ndo so. Yet we know that, for a developing country like\r\nmy own, there is no real option but to take full\r\nadvantage of the digital revolution. We will therefore\r\nbe supporting every global effort to call attention to the\r\nneed for bridging the digital divide.\r\nThe turn of the millennium has brought new\r\nchallenges, and with it changes to the character and\r\ncomplexity of the United Nations role in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. Samoa is proud to\r\nhave been able to contribute to the civilian police\r\noperations in East Timor. From this experience it is\r\nclear to us that if the United Nations is to do its job of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, it needs to\r\nbe given the necessary tools and resources.\r\nWe have learned a great deal from the report of\r\nthe Panel on United Nations Peace Operations, and we\r\nknow that the United Nations needs to improve its\r\ncapacity to respond to conflicts more effectively. And\r\nwe need to move forward with the peacekeeping\r\nreform process.\r\nThe recognition implicit in the awarding of the\r\nNobel Peace Prize to the United Nations means that\r\nmore than ever, we need to modernize and strengthen\r\nour Organization. We fully support the current efforts\r\nto review and revitalize the working methods of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe commend most highly the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s Open-ended Working Group on\r\nreform of the Security Council and its Bureau. Difficult\r\nand critical issues remain. But we need to maintain the\r\npolitical momentum provided in the Millennium\r\nSummit for comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Membership of the Council, both permanent\r\nand non-permanent, needs to be enlarged to reflect the\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nrealities of the present time and to enhance its role and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nFinally, let me refer to the twenty-second special\r\nsession of the General Assembly, in 1999, that\r\nreviewed the Barbados Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates. Since that time, a number of global events, such\r\nas the tenth session of the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development and the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries\r\nhave recalled the fragility of small island States in the\r\nglobalizing economy. We, of course, are grateful for\r\nthis acknowledgement. However, I believe I reflect the\r\naspiration of all small island States in saying that we\r\nneed to do much more in terms of concrete actions -\r\nactions that will only be meaningful if we are assured\r\nof the committed support of the whole international\r\ncommunity.\r\nOvercoming the well-recognized vulnerability of\r\nsmall island States like my own, and the exposure of\r\nisland communities to the effects of global climate\r\nchange, natural disasters, environmental damage and\r\nglobal economic shocks will be an essential element of\r\nsustainable development in all small island regions.\r\nMay I say, in this connection, that Samoa very\r\nmuch welcomes the successful conclusion yesterday in\r\nMarrakech of the seventh session of the Conference of\r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change. The completion of the\r\noperational details of the Kyoto Protocol will, we hope,\r\nopen the way to widespread ratification by\r\nGovernments and the Protocol’ s early entry into force,\r\nperhaps by the time of the Johannesburg World Summit\r\nnext year.\r\nThe struggle against climate change is not just an\r\nenvironmental issue. It is also a matter of fundamental\r\ndevelopment. It is so because the adverse impact of\r\nclimate change endangers economic and social\r\nprogress. This is most certainly the case for small\r\nisland States, which are widely acknowledged to be\r\namong the most vulnerable and the least able to adapt.\r\nThe world community’s response to climate change\r\ntherefore requires significant, long-term changes in\r\neconomic and social behaviour. The United Nations has\r\nan urgent and vital responsibility in this task as well.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Independent State\r\nof Samoa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Malialegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Samoa, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Crown Prince\r\nAlbert, Crown Prince of the Principality of Monaco\r\nCrown Prince Albert, Crown Prince of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Serene Highness Crown Prince Albert,\r\nCrown Prince of the Principality of Monaco, and invite\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nCrown Prince Albert (Principality of Monaco)\r\n(spoke in French): In taking the floor here at the\r\nHeadquarters of our Organization — recipient of the\r\n2001 Nobel Peace Prize — meeting in New York,\r\nwhich has been so tragically attacked, I wish naturally,\r\nat the outset, to renew to the delegation of the United\r\nStates and the great country it represents, our friend,\r\nand the American people the expression of heartfelt\r\nsympathy of the Principality of Monaco. Confronted\r\nwith insane actions that prompt horror and indignation,\r\nwe find ourselves in natural solidarity in this ordeal, as\r\nwell as in the task that now faces the international\r\ncommunity of making decisions and working so that\r\nour States and societies will be spared other appalling\r\nviolent acts in the future.\r\nI would like once again to extend to you, Mr.\r\nPresident, and to all the members of the Bureau our\r\nsincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of this session of the General Assembly. I\r\nam confident that, under your great leadership, our\r\nwork will be carried out in a way that will best meet\r\nthe expectations of the international community. I also\r\nwish to assure you of the spirit of cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Monaco.\r\nI also wish to hail the brilliant re-election of the\r\nSecretary-General, a clear sign of the confidence that\r\nwe have in his intelligence and humanity, which are\r\nlinked to his profound knowledge of the circumstances\r\nin which he must discharge his noble mission regarding\r\nworld affairs, of which our Organization is seized. We\r\nalso wish to assure him of the great satisfaction that the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, my country, shares at the\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nrenewal of his mandate and of our full support, which\r\nwe will continue to offer him.\r\nWe are very gratified that the 2001 Nobel Peace\r\nPrize was awarded to him jointly with our\r\nOrganization, a fully deserved and justified reward that\r\nshould motivate us — the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations — to work together even more with\r\nhim to champion peace and to fight the many seeds of\r\nconflict that threaten our world, terrorism, human\r\nrights violations, underdevelopment and pandemics\r\nsuch as AIDS.\r\nThe tragic circumstances in which this session of\r\nthe General Assembly is taking place make it our duty\r\nto contribute with even greater determination than in\r\nthe past to the struggle against terrorism. Owing to\r\ntheir enormity and to the defiance that is behind them,\r\nits manifestations can, as we have seen, pose a grave\r\nthreat to international peace and security. The\r\nPrincipality of Monaco firmly supports everything the\r\nOrganization has adopted and implemented to stifle\r\nthis scourge, which can be so devastating to the\r\nprinciples we all hold. The fact that what a lawyer\r\nwould call “edged weapons” were enough to bring\r\ndown one of the most modern and sophisticated\r\nsymbols of human creativity reminds us of the fragility\r\nof our societies, which densely populated urban centres\r\nand interdependence in all vital areas make even more\r\nvulnerable in the light of the boundless contempt of\r\nsome for human life and human dignity.\r\nAmong the most important of the commitments\r\nour States have undertaken on behalf of their peoples\r\nby signing the Charter of the United Nations are the\r\nobligations to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity, to develop friendly relations among nations\r\nand to encourage respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms: commitments that a handful of\r\nterrorists, in their blind facelessness, rejected with\r\nappalling arrogance and savage brutality.\r\nTwo months to the day have elapsed since that\r\ntragic event. Although emotions have by no means\r\nsubsided, the healing effects of time are beginning to\r\ngive us a little of the sense of distance that is so\r\nnecessary for more objective consideration of this\r\nastonishing political challenge and this unacceptable\r\nhuman tragedy.\r\nThe General Assembly very quickly undertook\r\nsuch consideration through its debate in early October\r\non measures to eliminate international terrorism. For\r\nits part, the Security Council had already correctly\r\nmarked out the initial path and the principal guidelines.\r\nAnd the Secretary-General has repeatedly called on\r\nMember States to remain more united than ever, and it\r\nappears that his words have been heeded.\r\nAlthough the nature of terrorism did not change\r\non 11 September, its scale did. The General Assembly\r\ndecided to respond with a complete cohesiveness that\r\nhas been rare in its history. By adopting its resolution\r\n1373 (2001), the Security Council did not shrink from\r\ndrawing on the full scope and range of its powers under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter; it took note of the existence\r\nof a threat to peace and an act of aggression and thus\r\ndecided on the exceptional measures that the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco is proud to be implementing.\r\nFor us, following up on these initiatives with the\r\nnecessary effectiveness means not only implementing\r\nthe resolutions that reflect our common determination\r\nand our commitment to fight terrorism and formulating\r\nadditional agreements and conventions, but also, first\r\nand foremost, bringing our expertise to the\r\nimplementation of instruments that have already been\r\nconcluded and to which we have acceded or intend to\r\naccede. Improving the Organization’s action in the\r\nlegal sphere is both indispensable and of top priority;\r\nwe know this, as does the Government of the\r\nPrincipality. Therefore, yesterday I signed and\r\ndeposited, on behalf of my father, the sovereign Prince,\r\nthe instruments of ratification of the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism. The Principality of Monaco considers it\r\nessential that there be coordinated worldwide action\r\nagainst all forms of financing of terrorism, in order to\r\ndeprive extremist movements of the resources that\r\nenable them to do such serious harm to the\r\ninternational community and to its deep-seated\r\naspirations to peace and security. Afghanistan, much of\r\nwhose territory is occupied and a portion of whose\r\npeople are today enslaved, is the most telling example\r\nof this.\r\nThe visionary Millennium Declaration and the\r\noutcomes of recent world conferences — such as the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and the\r\nDurban World Conference Against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related\r\nIntolerance — also merit special attention. Without\r\nquestion, these latter can contribute greatly to\r\nimproving, respectively, international security and\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nunderstanding among peoples. On the fight against\r\nracism, the subject of the Durban World Conference, I\r\nwould note that the Government of the Principality of\r\nMonaco has decided to recognize the competence of\r\nthe Committee on the Elimination of Racial\r\nDiscrimination, established under the International\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\r\nDiscrimination, to receive and process communications\r\nfrom individuals or groups of persons charging\r\nviolations of a right set out in that instrument, to which\r\nMonaco is a party.\r\nInternational economic and financial cooperation,\r\nwith its inevitable human and social consequences,\r\nmust also be included in the reflection prompted by\r\nthese events, which is more necessary than ever in the\r\nlight of the issues facing us today. Because it is in\r\npart the result of the new interdependence, the\r\nglobalization of trade in products, manufactured goods\r\nand services — disparaged by some and hailed by\r\nothers — must also be a part of our urgent intellectual\r\nand practical endeavours, so that beyond the\r\nconstraints and imperatives that guide it, human beings\r\ncan regain their just, legitimate role. Above all, the\r\neconomy must serve today’s men and women, with\r\nrespect for their legitimate aspirations, their vital needs\r\nand the age-old richness of their diversity.\r\nRegional and subregional cooperation is\r\nparticularly conducive to such a goal. My country is\r\nconvinced of that; in the Mediterranean area we are\r\nengaged in the trade, culture and technological spheres,\r\nand are working to promote sustainable development\r\nand environmental protection. Nor should we neglect\r\nactivities which by their nature tend to bring together\r\nmen and women from different backgrounds, such as\r\nartistic and cultural events, academic meetings and\r\nsporting competitions. In the Assembly’s debate on the\r\nagenda item entitled “Building a peaceful and better\r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”, the\r\ndelegation of Monaco will recall the irreplaceable role\r\nin that connection of physical education and sport, as\r\nwell as of the Olympic games.\r\nAnother way to bring human communities\r\ntogether is the multilingualism for which the United\r\nNations must be a model. That key item is on the\r\nAssembly’s agenda this year. The Principality of\r\nMonaco will state its views on that subject and will\r\nstress the remarkable and unquestionable advantages of\r\nmultilingualism for genuine understanding and mutual\r\nrespect among peoples.\r\nAlongside modern science and technology, which\r\nare moving forward and rapidly becoming universal,\r\nthus fostering exchanges among peoples, more\r\ntraditional forms of communication also have an\r\nimportant role to play. In our view, teaching and\r\ninformation, more than ever before, have a\r\nfundamental role in spreading ideas of peace and\r\nunderstanding among men and women in our troubled\r\ntimes. Here, the General Conference of the United\r\nNations Educational, Cultural and Scientific\r\nOrganization has given us excellent regulatory texts,\r\nworking documents and programmes that we must\r\nrevitalize with increased energy in order to provide\r\ngreater hope to young people, who are often frustrated\r\nby the harshness of daily life.\r\nWe also, and very often, give thought to the seas\r\nand the oceans, which made such a contribution in\r\nancient times to meetings of civilizations and to the\r\nspread of knowledge, thus enriching art and culture\r\nwhile developing trade and solidarity. A few days from\r\nnow, the delegation of Monaco will state its views\r\nduring the consideration of the agenda item on oceans\r\nand the law of the sea. My country has always been\r\ndevoted to better scientific knowledge and careful\r\nprotection of the marine environment, an indispensable\r\nsource for the harmonious flourishing of life.\r\nThus the Principality of Monaco, with other\r\nMember States, requests the Assembly to grant\r\nobserver status to the International Hydrographic\r\nOrganization, for which it is the headquarters, in order\r\nto allow that institution to strengthen its cooperation\r\nwith Governments and to advance international\r\ninitiatives and exchanges in marine cartography —\r\ninitiatives and exchanges designed to spread\r\nknowledge of seabeds and coastal zones, as well as to\r\nmake navigation easier and safer.\r\nRespect for the decisions and resolutions taken by\r\nour forums and the strengthening of our regulatory\r\nactions, as well as the implementation of the\r\ndeclarations and plans of action of our recent global\r\nconferences, are significant commitments to which the\r\nauthorities of the Government of the Principality of\r\nMonaco are dedicated. In our difficult times, they\r\nrepresent shared values which prompt us to act together\r\nin the interest of our international community, which is\r\nalso in the interest of each of our countries.\r\nTo close on an optimistic note, allow me to\r\nexpress the hope — a hope that I believe is shared by\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nmany here — that the wisdom of nations united more\r\nthan ever before will be able to triumph rapidly over\r\nthe evil represented by terrorism in its new global and\r\nuniversal form, while extirpating from the world the\r\nstubborn roots that fuel it.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Crown Prince of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nCrown Prince Albert, Crown Prince of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: Before we continue to hear\r\nstatements by representatives, I wish to draw the\r\nattention of the Assembly to the security arrangements\r\nfor this general debate, and request the Assembly’s\r\nforbearance and cooperation in that regard. These\r\nsecurity arrangements are necessitated by the presence\r\nof high-ranking participants, including more than 40\r\nheads of State and Government, at a particularly tense\r\nperiod in our host city, in the aftermath of the 11\r\nSeptember terrorist attacks. The law enforcement\r\nauthorities here have been extremely helpful and\r\nefficient in this regard, and on behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I would like to thank them for their\r\nassistance. I believe it is time for all of us to\r\nunderstand that increased security is for the protection\r\nof us all, and therefore to render our cooperation in that\r\nspirit.\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. Kiichi\r\nMiyazawa, Member of Parliament and former Prime\r\nMinister of Japan.\r\nMr. Miyazawa (Japan): I would like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea, on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-sixth session, and to pay high tribute to him\r\nfor the efficient manner in which he has been guiding\r\nthis session under unprecedented circumstances. Japan\r\nis determined to continue to extend its full support to\r\nthe President.\r\nI would also like on this occasion to extend my\r\nsincere congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, and to the United Nations on being named\r\nthe recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize this year. I\r\nbelieve it is indeed a reflection of the international\r\ncommunity\u0027s appreciation for the efforts of the United\r\nNations, under the leadership of Secretary-General\r\nAnnan, for world peace and prosperity. The challenges\r\nfacing the international community, however, are\r\nbecoming increasingly diverse and difficult, and Japan\r\nwill cooperate fully with the activities of the United\r\nNations in responding to these situations.\r\nI deeply mourn the deaths of the victims of the\r\nseries of heinous terrorist attacks against the United\r\nStates on 11 September, who have left behind loving\r\nfamilies and friends in the United States and in many\r\nother countries. I extend my sincere condolences to the\r\nbereaved families and to all the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the terrorist\r\nattacks are threats against all humankind and are\r\nchallenges to democracy and freedom throughout the\r\nworld. The international community must establish a\r\nworld-wide circle of cooperation for the elimination of\r\nterrorism. In this context, I am encouraged that, in\r\nresponse to the recent attacks, the international\r\ncommunity is taking prompt actions at the United\r\nNations and in many other international and regional\r\norganizations and forums to prevent and eliminate\r\nterrorism. Considering the response to terrorism to be\r\nits own responsibility, Japan is determined to make the\r\nutmost efforts to prevent and eliminate such acts.\r\nJapan has made it clear that the terrorist attacks\r\non the United States must not be linked to Islamic\r\ndoctrine. It is extremely important that the international\r\ncommunity, transcending religious and ethnic\r\ndifferences, take unified actions to eliminate terrorism.\r\nThere are many things which the United Nations\r\nhas to do in order to eliminate terrorism. It is\r\nimperative that we faithfully and immediately\r\nimplement Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nand 1373 (2001). Japan is actively contributing to the\r\nwork of the Security Council in implementing\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). It is also important that all\r\nMember States accede to and fully observe the 12\r\ninternational conventions relating to terrorism and\r\naccelerate the work toward the adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nand an international convention for the suppression of\r\nacts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nMoreover, certain biological weapons, such as\r\nanthrax, can be produced with more limited funds and\r\nless advanced technologies than nuclear and chemical\r\nweapons. It is important to strengthen the Biological\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nWeapons Convention in order to effectively prevent the\r\nproduction of such weapons.\r\nJapan is itself making various efforts to eliminate\r\nterrorism. First, with regard to treaties, there are two\r\ntreaties concerning terrorism which Japan has either\r\nnot yet signed or not yet ratified. The International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\r\nhas recently been approved by the Diet, and Japan will\r\nimmediately begin the ratification process. Japan\r\nsigned the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism on 30\r\nOctober and would like to ratify it as soon as possible.\r\nIn addition, Japan is ready to cooperate with\r\ndeveloping countries in the fields of controlling the\r\nfinancing of terrorism, immigration control, aviation\r\nand maritime safety, measures against terrorism\r\nthrough biological and chemical weapons, and so forth.\r\nMoreover, Japan will take more active measures\r\nagainst terrorism by enacting a new law to support the\r\noperations of other countries that are trying to\r\neliminate the threat posed by the recent terrorist attacks\r\nand to extend assistance to affected people.\r\nIn view of the importance of ensuring the stability\r\nof Afghanistan’s neighbours, Japan is extending\r\nemergency economic assistance, which includes\r\nassistance to Afghan refugees, Pakistan and other\r\nneighbouring countries. Japan also decided to provide\r\nup to $120 million for Afghan refugee assistance\r\nefforts undertaken by United Nations agencies and\r\nother humanitarian organizations.\r\nWith winter approaching, there is an urgent\r\nhumanitarian need for the international community to\r\ndeliver food and other vital goods to the people in\r\nAfghanistan. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncall upon the international community to join forces in\r\nsupport of the humanitarian activities of United\r\nNations organizations.\r\nAs we look ahead to the future, the achievement\r\nof peace and stability in Afghanistan is extremely\r\nimportant not only to eliminate a hotbed of global\r\nterrorism but also to lay the foundation for the long-\r\nterm stability and development of the country and the\r\nneighbouring region. Based on this recognition, it is\r\nnecessary for the international community to tackle this\r\nissue from a long-term and broad perspective.\r\nTowards that end, it goes without saying that,\r\nfirst of all, a Government must be established that has\r\nthe broad support of the Afghan people, represents\r\nevery ethnic group, adheres to international law and\r\nestablishes friendly relations with the international\r\ncommunity, including with neighbouring countries.\r\nHowever, the realities in Afghanistan do not offer a\r\nclear perspective and thus entail many unpredictable\r\nelements. Japan fully supports the activities of\r\nSecretary-General Annan and his Special\r\nRepresentative for Afghanistan, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\r\nto promote political stability in Afghanistan and will\r\nactively cooperate with them.\r\nJapan intends to play an active role both in the\r\npeace process and in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\r\nWe have been calling for holding a conference for\r\npeace and reconstruction in Afghanistan since 1996,\r\nand I would like on this occasion to reaffirm that Japan\r\nis ready to hold such a conference to contribute to that\r\ncountry’s peace and reconstruction at as early a time as\r\npossible, in cooperation with relevant countries and\r\norganizations.\r\nThe United Nations has serious responsibilities\r\nfor addressing relating to terrorism. Japan will spare no\r\neffort in order that this session of the General\r\nAssembly can be as fruitful as possible for this\r\npurpose.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nJan Petersen, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Norway.\r\nMr. Petersen (Norway): First, I would like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly.\r\nFor more than half a century, the United Nations\r\nhas helped to settle conflicts and restore peace. We\r\nmust reinforce these efforts and focus our work.\r\nFor more than half a century, the United Nations\r\nhas worked to promote human rights and economic and\r\nsocial development. We must continue to invest in\r\nhuman dignity.\r\nFor more than half a century, the United Nations\r\nhas given millions of people hope for a better future.\r\nSuch hope has never been more important than it is\r\ntoday.\r\nThe Nobel Peace Prize could not have been\r\nawarded to more deserving candidates than Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan and the United Nations. Let me\r\nonce again extend my heartfelt congratulations.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nThe terrorist attacks on 11 September were not\r\nonly directed at innocent people. They were directed at\r\nthe very values on which the United Nations is based.\r\nWe stand united in our condemnation of these\r\nattacks, in our call for international cooperation to\r\nprevent and eradicate terrorism and to bring the guilty\r\nto justice. We will fight terrorism by all appropriate\r\nmeans: political, diplomatic, legal, financial and\r\nmilitary.\r\nNorway pledges its full support to the broad\r\nglobal coalition against terrorism. We are part of the\r\nAtlantic Alliance. We fully support the United States in\r\ndefending itself against international terrorism. We are\r\nimplementing the provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) by taking concrete steps to dry\r\nup the financial resources of terrorist networks.\r\nThe Taliban regime has refused to adhere to\r\nmandatory Security Council decisions. It is harbouring\r\nand supporting terrorists, in blunt contravention of\r\nCouncil resolutions. The Taliban are refusing to\r\ncooperate with the international community in our\r\ncommon efforts to eradicate international terrorism.\r\nThe use of military force is therefore the only option\r\nleft.\r\nThe military operations in Afghanistan are aimed\r\nat the terrorists and those who harbour them. They are\r\nnot aimed at innocent civilians or at Afghanistan as a\r\ncountry. They are aimed at a group of extremists who\r\nare exploiting a world religion for their own evil\r\npurposes.\r\nAfghanistan has suffered misrule and war for\r\ndecades. While the immediate task is to end terrorism\r\nand provide humanitarian support to those in need, we\r\nmust work in parallel for a political solution. This is\r\nprimarily the responsibility of the Afghan people\r\nthemselves, but the international community must\r\nassist. The United Nations must have a leading role.\r\nPlanning and preparations must start now. We strongly\r\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special\r\nRepresentative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, to\r\nhelp lay the foundation for a broad-based and lasting\r\npolitical solution.\r\nWe must ensure that the Afghans receive\r\nhumanitarian assistance both inside Afghanistan and in\r\nneighbouring countries. But while seeking to meet\r\nimmediate needs, we must also focus on the longer-\r\nterm assistance that will be necessary to rebuild this\r\nwar-torn society. We must improve respect for human\r\nrights and help the Afghan people, in particular\r\nwomen, who have suffered so terribly under Taliban\r\nrule. These are issues that Norway will focus on during\r\nits chairmanship of the Afghanistan Support Group\r\nnext year. Only through coordinated efforts can we\r\ncontribute to security and development in Afghanistan.\r\nA year ago, peace between the Israelis and the\r\nPalestinians appeared to be at hand. Today, the hope for\r\npeace and security has given way to disillusion, despair\r\nand the murder of civilians.\r\nWe are convinced that the only way out of the\r\ncurrent stalemate is through the full implementation of\r\nthe recommendations in the Mitchell report, which\r\nhave been endorsed by both parties and by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nFirst of all, there must be an immediate end to the\r\nviolence. Terrorism must be stopped. The cycle of\r\nviolent action and reaction must be broken. Political\r\nleaders on both sides must do everything in their power\r\nto halt the violence and reduce the tension.\r\nSecondly, confidence-building measures must be\r\nimplemented simultaneously. Trust must be rebuilt step\r\nby step, since without it there can be no real dialogue\r\nor negotiation. The Mitchell report lists several steps\r\nfor restoring trust. Given the high level of hostility and\r\nmistrust, the timing and sequence of these steps are\r\ncrucial. Decisions must be made now.\r\nThirdly, the parties must find a way back to the\r\nnegotiating table. A halt to the violence, the resumption\r\nof security cooperation and steps to restore trust cannot\r\nbe sustained for long without serious negotiations to\r\nresolve the underlying causes of the conflict.\r\nNorway will continue to support efforts to bring\r\nabout a peaceful resolution of the conflict. As Chair of\r\nthe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, we stand ready to\r\nwork with other donors to help restore the economic\r\nand social infrastructure in the Palestinian areas.\r\nThe bulk of the conflicts dealt with by the\r\nSecurity Council are found on the African continent.\r\nAs a member of the Security Council, Norway is\r\ndetermined to do what it can to promote long-term\r\npeace and stability in Africa. Most of the conflicts in\r\nAfrica clearly demonstrate the close links between\r\npeace, good governance and development. The root\r\ncauses of many of these conflicts are poverty and lack\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nof development, but also violations of human rights\r\nand disrespect for basic democratic principles.\r\nNorway stands ready to assist in building a sound\r\nfoundation for good governance and development in\r\nAfrica. The developments in Burundi are encouraging,\r\nalthough we recognize that the peace process is still\r\nvery fragile. The deployment of a multinational\r\nsecurity force, on the initiative of South Africa, will,\r\nhopefully, improve the situation in Burundi. Norway is\r\nready to support this initiative.\r\nThe United Nations is our foremost tool for\r\nsolving global problems. We should recall that\r\ncombating terrorism has not removed any of the\r\nchallenges that were on the global agenda prior to\r\n11 September. Nor has it become less pressing to\r\neffectively address these challenges. We must not let\r\nthe cruelty of terrorists divert attention from the\r\nambitious goals we set for ourselves during the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nMeeting those objectives must remain right at the\r\ntop of our agenda, along with our common fight against\r\nterrorism. If the United Nations is to be effective in\r\npursuing these tasks, we must all commit ourselves and\r\nprovide the necessary resources and financial support.\r\nAs political leaders, we must show steadfast\r\ndetermination. We will have to make difficult choices\r\nand hard decisions, sometimes with painful\r\nconsequences. But the alternative is even more pain\r\nand suffering.\r\nThis is true in our common fight against\r\ninternational terrorism. This is true in our struggle to\r\nend poverty, eliminate infectious diseases and uphold\r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law. This is\r\ntrue if we are to make the United Nations our primary\r\ntool for safeguarding our common security.\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency Mr. Dah\r\nOuld Abdi, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Mauritania.\r\nMr. Ould Abdi (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nam delighted to be able to congratulate you, Sir, on\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Islamic Republic of\r\nMauritania, on your election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\ncertain that your experience and wisdom will indeed\r\nguarantee success at this session.\r\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to express\r\nmy gratitude to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nfor his skilful and distinguished guidance of the work\r\nof the past session. This is also an opportunity for me\r\nto extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the entire United Nations staff on their\r\ntireless efforts to achieve the noble objectives of our\r\nOrganization. Those efforts have quite rightly been\r\nrecognized by the Nobel Academy, which decided to\r\naward the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the\r\nSecretary-General and the United Nations. This\r\ndistinction reflects the most striking recognition of the\r\nefforts undertaken by our Organization to strengthen\r\ninternational peace and security. It also constituted\r\nrecognition of the personal merits and contributions of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. Moreover, the\r\nre-election of the Secretary-General to a second term\r\nreflected the satisfaction of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThis session is taking place in a climate of\r\nsadness in the aftermath of the criminal attacks on New\r\nYork and on Washington, D.C., with their heavy toll of\r\nthousands of innocent lives. The moment they were\r\nperpetrated, Mauritania voiced its absolute\r\ncondemnation of those terrorist acts. My country\r\nreaffirms its condolences to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States. These tragic events\r\nhave cast light on a new situation: terrorism is no\r\nlonger a marginal phenomenon but is rather a key\r\nproblem that knows no boundaries and that can be\r\ncombated only by means of a global strategy.\r\nMauritania continues to be an active participant in all\r\nregional and international activities aimed at a\r\nconcerted and comprehensive fight against that\r\nphenomenon. In that context, we reaffirm our\r\nunreserved support for all relevant resolutions, along\r\nwith our determination, specifically, to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28\r\nSeptember.\r\nIt is obvious that the role and international\r\nlegitimacy of the United Nations in bringing about\r\ninternational peace, security and stability must be\r\nenhanced. No one must suggest that fighting terrorism\r\nis a campaign by one civilization against another, or\r\nthe supposed supremacy of one civilization over any\r\nother. To the contrary, we must act together to show\r\nthat the endeavour to eliminate terrorism marks a new\r\nphase in humankind’s march forward, building on the\r\nheritage of all civilizations and converging in an\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nexpression of our common aspiration to a secure life\r\nand a better future.\r\nIn that connection, my country notes with\r\nsatisfaction the sustained efforts and the success of\r\nrepeated appeals to bring peace to the Middle East so\r\nthat the peoples of that region can live in peace,\r\nsecurity and prosperity. We hope that the peace process\r\nwill be resumed in accordance with the principles\r\nenunciated at the Madrid Conference, in keeping with\r\nthe principle of land for peace, and in conformity with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973)\r\nand 425 (1978), thus bringing about the complete\r\nwithdrawal of Israel from all Arab territories occupied\r\nin 1967 and the establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State with its capital in the holy city of Al-\r\nQuds Al-Sharif.\r\nWe express our hope for a return to stability and\r\nconcord in the Gulf region, consistent with\r\ninternational legality and with respect for the\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of Kuwait, as\r\nwell as with respect for the unity and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq. In that context, we call for the lifting\r\nof the embargo that has been imposed for more than 10\r\nyears on the fraternal Iraqi people, who have suffered\r\nimmensely from that embargo.\r\nWith respect to Western Sahara, my country\r\nsupports the efforts of the Secretary-General and of his\r\nPersonal Envoy, Mr. James A. Baker III, to guarantee\r\nstability in the area through a final solution that would\r\nenjoy the support of all parties concerned.\r\nTurning to developments in the Lockerbie crisis,\r\nwe welcome the success of diplomatic initiatives, but\r\nat the same time feel that the Security Council should\r\nact to lift the embargo imposed on Libya.\r\nWe hail everything that has been done to resolve\r\nconflicts and wars on the African continent, which\r\nhave stymied development efforts there. We welcome\r\nthe recent all-Africa development initiative and the\r\nsupport it has won from our development partners in\r\nterms, inter alia, of sources of financing.\r\nIt has now been proven that phenomena such as\r\nviolence and extremism are the outgrowth of poverty\r\nand frustration. The international community must\r\ntherefore go further to demonstrate its solidarity and\r\nhelp achieve social development throughout the world.\r\nDeveloping countries hope for a greater, more reliable\r\nspirit of solidarity that is expressed in deeds. They\r\nneed increased support from the rich countries in the\r\nform of greater investment and the opening up of\r\ninternational markets to products from the developing\r\nworld.\r\nWe must recall too that debt continues to be\r\namong the major obstacles to progress in the\r\neconomies of developing countries and a handicap to\r\neconomic development.\r\nNotwithstanding the scope of the challenges and\r\nthe unfavourable international situation, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Mauritania, under the enlightened\r\nleadership of His Excellency President Maaouya Ould\r\nSid’ Ahmed Taya, has made major strides towards\r\nsustainable development, with a view to improving the\r\nstandard of living of our people, achieving social\r\nadvancement and consolidating democracy and the rule\r\nof law in a climate of peace, security and stability.\r\nPluralistic democracy has been restored in full with the\r\nholding some weeks ago of our fifth municipal\r\nelections and our third legislative elections. Among the\r\nlatest reforms are the introduction of proportional\r\nrepresentation, which has made possible the\r\ninvolvement of all parties and which has expanded the\r\nvoter base and involvement in political life. Observers\r\nand opposition parties praised the conduct and the\r\noutcome of the elections. The broadest possible\r\nparticipation by the people is the best guarantee of\r\nsuccess in the fight against poverty, illiteracy and\r\nexclusion. This has strengthened our conviction that\r\ntrue enjoyment of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms depends on the ability of the people to take\r\npart in economic, social and cultural decisions.\r\nA purpose of the Charter of the United Nations is\r\nto realize our common goals. Now more than ever, we\r\nmust make an effort to live up to our Charter\r\ncommitments in order to bring about a new world\r\nbased on law and justice, guaranteeing peace, security\r\nand solidarity.\r\nMr. Gama (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): It is with\r\ngreat pleasure that I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo\r\non his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly. I also pay tribute to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri. I renew my respects to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the notable and\r\ncourageous way in which he has continued to fulfil his\r\nmandate and for the well-deserved award of the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize to him and to the United Nations.\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nMy Belgian colleague has already addressed the\r\nAssembly on behalf of the 15 States members of the\r\nEuropean Union in a statement with which my country\r\naligns itself completely. I would, however, like to\r\nreflect upon certain issues on the international agenda.\r\nFirst, I cannot fail to refer to the tragic terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September against the United States, and\r\nin particular against the city of New York and innocent\r\ncitizens of many nationalities. I reiterate our deep\r\nsorrow and reaffirm our complete solidarity with all\r\nthose who, like us Portuguese, were victimized by the\r\nloss of their compatriots and by the suffering of the\r\nbereaved families.\r\nWe are dealing with violence without a face,\r\nviolence that kills indiscriminately and that must be\r\nconfronted by the international community as a whole,\r\nirrespective of the religion we practice, the race to\r\nwhich we belong, the ideology we follow or the\r\ncivilization into which we were born. It falls to each\r\nand every State Member of the United Nations to fight\r\nthis scourge, whose blind hatred has plunged the world\r\ninto a state of turmoil not seen since the end of the\r\nSecond World War. What is most shocking to us is the\r\nfact that we are faced with a force that ignores or\r\ndespises the very concept of the right to life.\r\nWe must embark on a concerted effort at all\r\nlevels to submit to justice those guilty of the crimes\r\ncommitted, with a view to avoiding a repetition of the\r\nterrorist acts of September. We believe the United\r\nNations has an irreplaceable role to play as the source\r\nof legitimacy for the collective effort of the\r\ninternational community in the fight against this\r\ncommon enemy. It is for other forums to complement\r\nthese actions, orienting and adjusting them in\r\naccordance with the concrete needs of their respective\r\nmandates.\r\nIn this context, I would like to recall that Portugal\r\nhas supported without reservation the international\r\nfight against terrorism here in the United Nations, in\r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in the\r\nEuropean Union, in the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and in our bilateral\r\nrelations with the United States and other countries. I\r\nwould like to assure the Assembly that in its\r\npresidency of the OSCE next year, Portugal will\r\nattribute particular priority to this matter.\r\nIn the light of the current circumstances, I must\r\nstress the importance of the entire range of\r\ninternational legislation produced, or awaiting\r\napproval, under the aegis of the United Nations in the\r\narea of the fight against terrorism: the 12 conventions\r\nwhose ratification and implementation make them\r\ncrucial weapons in preventing and fighting against this\r\nscourge. Because of its particular significance at this\r\ntime, I refer specifically to the work of the General\r\nAssembly on the draft global convention on terrorism.\r\nThe great efforts made by the great majority of\r\ndelegations in search of compromise solutions bear\r\nwitness to a renewed convergence of wills in pursuit of\r\nthis common goal. We should take advantage of the\r\ncurrent momentum of collective commitment to reach\r\nthe speedy completion of this essential instrument.\r\nPortugal has already signed 11 of the 12\r\ninternational conventions against terrorism and is\r\nstrongly committed to fully implementing their\r\nprovisions. Yesterday we deposited our instrument of\r\nratification for the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, and shortly we will\r\ndeposit our instrument of ratification for the Protocol\r\nfor the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at\r\nAirports Serving International Civil Aviation. We\r\nwelcome the adoption of Security Council resolutions\r\n1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), which are fundamental\r\ninstruments for the cohesion of the international\r\ncommunity in its legitimate fight against terrorism. I\r\nwould also like to highlight the measures contained\r\ntherein for the fight against terrorist financing — an\r\nabsolutely crucial area.\r\nAs I have already stated, Portugal has supported\r\nfrom the beginning the international campaign under\r\nway in Afghanistan, which has been legitimized by the\r\ndeliberations of the United Nations. Those responsible\r\nfor the terrorist acts that claimed the lives of thousands\r\nof innocent civilians on 11 September must be captured\r\nand tried, and their military infrastructure must be\r\neliminated. In our view, the principles guiding the\r\nintervention in Afghanistan should include the\r\npreservation of territorial integrity and the unity of the\r\ncountry, as well as the establishment of a broadly\r\nsupported, multi-ethnic and representative\r\nGovernment.\r\nWe believe that, from the very start, the Afghan\r\npeople should be associated with the reconstruction of\r\ntheir country, which has been devastated in recent years\r\nby a brutal regime that is not recognized\r\ninternationally. The international community should\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nspare no efforts in alleviating the serious humanitarian\r\nsituation affecting the Afghan people.\r\nFinally, let me reiterate that the Portuguese\r\nGovernment unequivocally supports the efforts\r\nundertaken by the United Nations, and in particular by\r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Lakdar Brahimi, in envisioning a transitional\r\ngovernmental structure and in planning a possible\r\nUnited Nations mission on the ground. In a post-\r\nTaliban scenario, the United Nations will be called\r\nupon to take a decisive role in the reconstruction of\r\nAfghanistan as well as in the establishment of peaceful\r\nrelations between Afghanistan and its neighbours.\r\nThe United Nations plays an indispensable role in\r\nthe prevention of conflicts, the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the reconstruction\r\nof territories devastated by war. Numerous conflicts are\r\nawaiting resolution and constitute a considerable\r\nchallenge to the international community’s capacity to\r\nguarantee their peaceful and definitive settlement.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East, specifically in\r\nPalestine, is the most worrisome, placing even\r\ninternational security at risk. The international\r\ncommunity can spare no efforts to ensure that Israel\r\nand the Palestinians return to the path of dialogue.\r\nOnly there will a solution be found that is just, both for\r\nthe Palestinian people — who have fought for decades\r\nfor the recognition of their homeland, an inalienable\r\nand undeniable right, and for dignified living\r\nconditions within a sovereign and responsible\r\nPalestinian State — and for Israel, which has an equal\r\nright to live in security in the region and at peace with\r\nits neighbours.\r\nAs another example of international conflicts that\r\ndrag on, apparently with no definitive resolution in\r\nsight, my country profoundly regrets the continuation\r\nof the armed conflict in Angola and its severe\r\nhumanitarian consequences. Portugal reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to and support for the search for a\r\npolitical solution to this problem, in line with the\r\nprovisions of the Acordos de Paz, the Lusaka Protocol\r\nand the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It\r\nis essential that the commitments undertaken with\r\nregard to the international community, and principally\r\nwith regard to the Angolan people, be respected.\r\nPortugal encourages the Angolan Government to\r\nredouble its efforts to achieve national reconciliation.\r\nWe also encourage the introduction of political and\r\neconomic reforms in Angola, with a view to\r\nreinforcing in particular the legitimacy of its\r\nrepresentative and pluralistic institutions and the\r\nstrengthening of the credibility of its monetary and\r\nfinancial structures.\r\nWe also appeal for a return to political means on\r\nthe part of those — such as the sector that inspires the\r\nmore radical line of UNITA — that have resorted to\r\nmethods, namely violence against civilians, that have\r\nplaced them outside the international community. In\r\nfact, the absence of constructive proposals — including\r\nwith regard to a ceasefire or the cessation of offensive\r\noperations — does not contribute to the\r\nimplementation of possible platforms for dialogue,\r\nwhich the current situation demands.\r\nWe praise the important and increasing\r\ncontribution made by Angolan society, particularly its\r\nchurches, to peace and reconciliation. We believe that a\r\nUnited Nations presence in Angola continues to be\r\nessential and should be encouraged.\r\nIn that vein, I would like to actively encourage\r\nthe Secretary-General to intensify all possible efforts to\r\nrelaunch the peace process in Angola with a view to\r\nthe adequate implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, so\r\nthat that great country can finally guarantee tranquillity\r\nto its citizens and recover its standing and the role to\r\nwhich it is entitled in international life, fully taking\r\npart in achieving the objectives of the African\r\nrenaissance. I am certain that the troika of observer\r\nStates, as well as the African regional organizations\r\nand the European Union, will firmly support the\r\ncontribution of the Secretary-General to a definitive\r\nresolution of the Angolan issue.\r\nWhen the international community successfully\r\nintervenes in a conflict, it should not be turned aside\r\nfrom the consolidation of the solutions reached. The\r\nUnited Nations has the responsibility of maintaining an\r\nappropriate level of involvement until the definitive\r\nconclusion of the peace process, so as not to put at risk\r\nthe investments made and expectations created. The\r\nUnited Nations should proceed without hesitation in\r\nsupporting the creation of viable nations.\r\nI welcome the Security Council’s endorsement of\r\nthis understanding with regard to East Timor, on 31\r\nOctober. The international community cannot neglect\r\nthe consolidation of the solutions achieved in East\r\nTimor, whose transition to independence is, in fact, a\r\nclear case of success for the United Nations and a\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nspecial reason for pride for the Community of\r\nPortuguese-Speaking Countries. I take this opportunity\r\nto underline that this entire process has been conducted\r\nin an exemplary manner by the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor under the\r\nleadership of Sergio Vieira de Mello.\r\nThe work of the United Nations towards the\r\nconsolidation of a new and indisputably sovereign,\r\ndemocratic and economically viable State only\r\nreinforces the credibility of the Organization at a time\r\nin international life when its inspiration and leadership\r\nare more needed than ever before to correctly manage\r\nthe great global challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nHeinz Möeller Freile, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nEcuador.\r\nMr. Möeller Freile (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved election\r\nas President of the General Assembly. You are a worthy\r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Korea, a country very\r\nclose to my own through our important ties of\r\nfriendship and cooperation. I also congratulate your\r\npredecessor on the highly efficient and responsible way\r\nin which he oversaw the work of the previous session\r\nof the Assembly.\r\nThe Government of Ecuador received with\r\nspecial satisfaction the news of the award of the 2001\r\nNobel Peace Prize to the United Nations and the\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan. We congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General on this well-deserved recognition of\r\nhis work, which has promoted among Member States\r\nthe benefits of international association and solidarity.\r\nThis session of the Assembly began in an\r\natmosphere of profound distress for all members of the\r\ninternational community. The tragically terrible\r\nterrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September\r\nare shocking to the human conscience. Those whose\r\nperverse and irrational actions took the lives of\r\nthousands of innocent people — including many\r\nEcuadorians — committed a grave attack on\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I wish to affirm to the people\r\nand the Government of the United States of America\r\nthe profound condolences and solidarity of the people\r\nand the Government of Ecuador following this\r\nimmense tragedy and to reiterate our strongest\r\ncondemnation of those criminal acts, which have done\r\nviolence to all peoples, as well as to universal\r\nprinciples and values.\r\nThat is why Ecuador — a peace-loving country\r\nconvinced of the predominant role of the United\r\nNations as the key institution for decisions affecting\r\nthe world — praises the action of the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council in response to\r\nterrorism, particularly the Council’s adoption of\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which contains the guidelines\r\nfor all Member States to work urgently and in concert\r\nto prevent and suppress terrorist acts. Likewise, the\r\ninternational community must conclude negotiations on\r\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nto strengthen the relevant judicial framework with\r\nconcrete measures to prevent, sanction and combat this\r\nscourge. Ecuador is committed at the national, regional\r\nand international levels to the fight against terrorism in\r\nall its forms and manifestations.\r\nIn the final years of the twentieth century, great\r\nchanges took place in the world, which led to new\r\ninternational trends, especially in terms of the process\r\nof globalization and threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe developing countries, such as my own, began\r\nadapting their national structures to deal with the\r\ndemands of a decidedly competitive environment.\r\nHowever, it must be said that it is obvious that the\r\nadjustments and changes those countries have made to\r\ntheir policies and strategies are not enough in\r\nthemselves to achieve complete results as long as the\r\nstructural causes of the disparity between the level of\r\ndevelopment of highly industrialized economies and\r\nthat of economies in need of capital and advanced\r\ntechnology persist. That disparity continues to widen\r\nbecause of financial difficulties caused by unstable\r\nshort-term capital flows, persistent external debt and\r\nobstacles to truly international trade.\r\nThere are signs that current international\r\neconomic trends are far from providing the equilibrium\r\nand justice needed to overcome the unfavourable\r\nburdens inherited from the twentieth century. Poverty\r\nhas grown at alarming rates in all regions. International\r\norganized crime has exacerbated violence and\r\ninsecurity in society. Massive international migration\r\ntowards developed regions continues to increase. These\r\nphenomena, along with many others, result from the\r\nlack of real, universal agreements to assist the\r\ndevelopment of human beings.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nThe problems that the world faces today respect\r\nno national borders. They are threats demanding not\r\nunilateral action but responses based on solidarity and\r\nconcerted action. That interdependence is what enabled\r\nthe heads of Government and State, at the Millennium\r\nAssembly, to agree on making the United Nations, the\r\nsupreme multilateral forum, a suitable and effective\r\ninstrument to fight for the development of all peoples\r\nof the world; to fight against poverty, ignorance and\r\ndisease; to fight against injustice, violence, terror and\r\ncrime; and to fight against the deterioration and\r\ndestruction of the planet. They also committed\r\nthemselves to freeing all people from the scourge of\r\nwar, to eradicating the dangers posed by weapons of\r\nmass destruction and to strengthening respect for the\r\nrule of law in national and international affairs.\r\nEcuador, as a country that believes in and\r\npractices the peaceful settlement of international\r\ndisputes, regrets and condemns conflicts between\r\nStates, as well as those within States caused by civil\r\nwar, ethnic conflict or other reasons. The Government\r\nof Ecuador is concerned by the uncontrolled violence\r\noccurring between the peoples of Palestine and Israel,\r\nwhich continues to reap a tragic harvest of death and\r\ndestruction. We recognize the right of the Palestinian\r\npeople to a free and independent State, as well as the\r\nState of Israel’s right to exist within secure and\r\ninternationally recognized borders. Ecuador reiterates\r\nits appeal to both parties to quickly return to peace\r\nnegotiations.\r\nLast August, Ecuador assumed the presidency of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Its\r\nleadership is guided by its profound commitment to the\r\ncause of general and complete disarmament under\r\neffective international control, which would make it\r\npossible to foster peace and confidence among nations.\r\nWe are witnessing the intensification of a\r\nphenomenon as old as humanity itself, undoubtedly\r\nlinked to the historical development of civilization. I\r\nam referring to the enormous challenge posed by the\r\nincrease in human migration, especially from the\r\ncountries of the South towards the North.\r\nWhile migration has been positive in that it has\r\ncontributed to fruitful exchange between various\r\npeoples and has deepened dialogue processes and\r\nmutual enrichment between diverse cultures, in most\r\ncases the reason for it stems from the individual’s\r\ndesire to seek better living conditions and broader\r\neconomic prospects. We cannot think of human history\r\nwithout the constant and ever present phenomenon of\r\nmigration, and the current era is no exception. In the\r\npresent age of the globalization of markets and the\r\npossibility of a new round of multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nthe liberalization of the administration of services\r\nthrough the free movement of persons must be\r\nemphasized.\r\nToday many developing countries of the world,\r\nafflicted by the serious consequences of economic\r\ncrisis and the prevalence of structural failures that are\r\ndifficult to overcome, have become net producers of\r\nmigrants, men and women who feel compelled to seek\r\nbroader horizons legally. Ecuador is one of those\r\ncountries because of the most serious economic crisis\r\nof its recorded history, exacerbated by external factors\r\nthat changed the momentum of the national\r\ndevelopment process. Internal and external factors\r\nmerged in recent years, deepening this crisis, which we\r\nare overcoming in a positive way at enormous\r\nsacrifice.\r\nWhile migration tends to be a positive\r\nphenomenon in terms of historic objectives, the\r\nconsequences for individuals are painful and stir our\r\nconscience. Because of that, my country has taken a\r\nseries of actions to protect the rights of migrants and\r\ntheir families. With the support of the International\r\nOrganization for Migration, we have held several\r\nmeetings in which the State and civil society have\r\nparticipated. They have enabled us, on the one hand, to\r\nhave direct testimony about the serious problems of\r\nthis group of individuals who have left their countries\r\nvoluntarily to find better opportunities and, on the\r\nother hand, to obtain concrete commitments aimed at\r\nprotecting and defending human rights. I wish to\r\nunderline the transnational nature of the migration\r\nproblem, which requires active cooperation between\r\ncountries of origin and countries receiving immigrants,\r\nas well as international bodies. In this context, I am\r\nhappy to point out that Ecuador and Spain signed an\r\nagreement aimed at regulating migration, which\r\nundoubtedly has been beneficial for migrant citizens\r\nand signatory countries.\r\nEcuador appeals to all Governments and sectors\r\nof civil society, but particularly to those of the\r\ndeveloped world — receivers of migrant workers - to\r\nredouble their efforts aimed at protecting the rights of\r\nthis vulnerable sector of society in a non-\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\ndiscriminatory way, conscious of all the positive and\r\nfruitful aspects that the migration phenomenon brings\r\nto the general development of countries, as\r\ndemonstrated by European history of recent centuries\r\nand the integration of the Americas into the West.\r\nIf the twentieth century was the stage for some of\r\nthe greatest humanitarian tragedies recorded by history,\r\nit is true that in that period we also witnessed the birth\r\nof a new global awareness of the urgency to protect and\r\npromote human rights and to preserve man’s home,\r\nland and environment.\r\nMy country has fully assumed this global\r\nchallenge. We are signatories to the main instruments\r\non this important item at both the international and the\r\nhemispheric level, and we have national tools that\r\nenable us to achieve such objectives. The National Plan\r\non Human Rights, adopted as a State policy in June\r\n1998 by civil society and the State, is perhaps the most\r\ninnovative and visionary instrument that has been\r\ndeveloped in our country. We hope that it will enable\r\nus to promote a real culture of tolerance and respect\r\nbetween the ethnic, social and cultural groups of our\r\nsociety. With this plan, Ecuador also complied with the\r\nmandate of the 1993 Vienna Declaration and\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nIn keeping with all the above-mentioned points,\r\nEcuador places importance on one of the mandates of\r\nthe Carabobo Act, signed in July 2001 by the\r\nPresidents of the Andean Community of Nations, and\r\nhas begun work on a draft Andean Charter of Human\r\nRights, aimed at consolidating the ideas of respect for\r\nand the promotion of the fundamental rights and\r\nfreedoms of the individual in the specific areas of\r\nculture and ethnic plurality characteristic of the\r\nAndean subregion. Ecuador was a pioneer in this\r\nimportant matter when, in 1980, within the subregional\r\nframework, it spurred on the adoption of the Riobamba\r\nCharter, which includes among its postulates the\r\nprotection of human rights as an international\r\nobligation of all States and the condition that legitimate\r\njoint action carried out in protecting such rights must\r\nnot violate the principle of non-intervention. Within\r\nthis same context, Ecuador signed the Rome Statute of\r\nthe International Court of Justice of July 1998, and it is\r\ntaking measures for its prompt ratification.\r\nTurning to the WTO and the Free Trade Area of\r\nthe Americas (FTAA), there is no doubt that one of the\r\nmost important items on the foreign policy agenda of\r\nStates is international economic relations. Ecuador\r\nwishes to express some views on this, at the moment\r\nwhen the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference is taking\r\nplace in Qatar.\r\nEcuador deems it fundamental to pursue the\r\nprocess of opening up trade, reducing tariffs and\r\neliminating unnecessary trade barriers. However, my\r\ncountry also shares the doubts of some developing\r\ncountries about the advantages of launching a new\r\nround of multilateral trade negotiations when the\r\ncommitments of the Uruguay Round have not yet been\r\nfully implemented, particularly those relating to the\r\nreduction and the elimination of agricultural subsidies\r\nand to agreement on special and differential treatment\r\nprovisions in favour of developing countries. These are\r\npriority items of interest for Ecuador, as is the\r\nexpansion of openness in agricultural trade.\r\nWe emphasize the necessary reform required by\r\nthe WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding to\r\nstrengthen the implementation regime of the decisions\r\nof the relevant ad hoc groups and the appeals body. For\r\nexample, Ecuador was never able to obtain the\r\ncompensation to which it was entitled, in spite of\r\nhaving won the banana dispute in all the proceedings\r\nbefore the WTO Dispute Settlement Body and an\r\narbitration award of $201.4 million annually, the\r\namount of the damages caused to my country by an\r\nillegal import, sales and distribution scheme of that\r\nproduct in Europe.\r\nGiven our own experience in this dispute, we\r\nbelieve that compensation must be binding, if we are\r\nreally speaking about free markets in the full sense of\r\nthe word, and that retaliatory measures in the same\r\nsector or in cross-sectors is not sufficient to repair the\r\ndamages caused, particularly to the economies of\r\ndeveloping countries. It would also be worth evaluating\r\nother types of compensation, such as increasing\r\ntechnical cooperation, as a European country is\r\nproposing at this time with respect to Ecuador.\r\nProgress in trade negotiations and the fulfilment\r\nof commitments already made will make it possible for\r\nus to have an international economic and financial\r\nclimate conducive to investment and to growth of the\r\nworld economy, which will make a positive\r\ncontribution to social and human development. These\r\nsame proposals give us hope in the negotiations of the\r\nFTAA — the Trade Negotiations Committee of which\r\nEcuador is currently president. Our efforts take into\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\naccount the various positions of countries, as well as\r\ntheir different levels of development and sizes of their\r\neconomies, since we must seek consensus on decisions\r\nin a way that makes all the parties involved feel that\r\ntheir interests are guaranteed. For least developed\r\ncountries, the establishment of a hemisphere-wide free-\r\ntrade zone poses a challenge and at the same time\r\noffers an exceptional opportunity to be fully integrated\r\ninto world economy in this new phase.\r\nI turn next to the question of external debt and\r\ndevelopment financing. The enormous limitations\r\nfaced by heavily indebted developing countries such as\r\nEcuador, resulting from disproportionately large\r\nexternal-debt servicing costs and from persistent\r\nobstacles to marketing our exports, work against\r\nnational efforts to engender economic stability and\r\nsustainable development. Ecuador’s total external debt\r\nnow stands at about 64 per cent of our gross domestic\r\nproduct and nearly 40 per cent of our national budget;\r\nthis has a negative impact on the financing of social\r\ndevelopment projects.\r\nExternal debt is mortgaging the economic present\r\nand future of developing countries; it has extremely\r\nadverse effects because it devours vast resources that\r\nwould otherwise be used in the fight against poverty, in\r\npromoting public health and education, and in meeting\r\nmany other urgent social needs. The situation thus has\r\nan increasing negative effect on market-oriented\r\nnational policies and the political and democratic\r\nstability of many countries. It is therefore time for the\r\ninternational community to adopt effective, fair,\r\nlasting, development-oriented measures so as to make\r\nprogress in easing this serious problem — a problem\r\nthat highly indebted medium-income countries too are\r\nfacing.\r\nEcuador attaches the greatest importance to the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment to be held next March at Monterrey. It\r\nwill be a good opportunity to define, from the\r\nfinancing perspective, a new kind of world cooperation\r\nthat will effectively support development, especially\r\nthe development of the countries of the South.\r\nI am pleased to announce the conclusion and\r\nsignature of an agreement between the World\r\nMeteorological Organization and the Government of\r\nEcuador on the establishment at Guayaquil of an\r\ninternational centre for research on El Niño. I urgently\r\nappeal to the United Nations and its specialized\r\nagencies, to the international community and to\r\ninternational and regional financial institutions for\r\nresolute cooperation to ensure that the centre begins its\r\nwork promptly.\r\nFinally, as an Ecuadorian, I wish to address the\r\nquestion of the Colombian conflict. I wish to say that\r\nmy country is following closely the internal political\r\nconflict in Colombia and the unfolding of a peace\r\nprocess in that country. In conformity with our policy\r\nof promoting dialogue and negotiation as the best way\r\nto overcome problems, we have frequently stated our\r\nunreserved political support for the Colombian\r\nGovernment’s efforts to reach a negotiated peace with\r\narmed irregular groups operating in its country.\r\nEcuador applauds the peace initiatives of President\r\nAndrés Pastrana and expresses the hope that they will\r\nbe meet with a matching response from those groups.\r\nPeace in Colombia is a top priority throughout the\r\nAmericas; it should also be a top priority for the\r\ninternational community. It is in the interest of all to\r\nhelp ensure that the Colombian conflict does not spread\r\nto the rest of the subregion.\r\nEcuador has committed itself to a broad and\r\nimaginative programme of development for our areas\r\nnear the Colombian border; these are aimed at\r\nsubstantial improvements in the living conditions of\r\nthe inhabitants, with a view to eliminating the severe\r\npoverty that gives rise to the violence of drug\r\ntrafficking. That programme has recently received\r\nmajor backing from the international community\r\nthrough the advisory group set up last month at\r\nBrussels. I appeal to our brethren and neighbours in\r\nColombia to join with us in similar programmes. I\r\nurgently appeal too to developed countries to continue\r\nto cooperate with such initiatives, which in the final\r\nanalysis are the best way to guarantee peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe challenges facing mankind at the outset of\r\nthe twenty-first century must be tackled by all\r\ncountries, jointly and in solidarity. This is the\r\nbeginning of a new era for major international\r\ndecisions. The world Organization is the forum in\r\nwhich we can carry out a vast mission: equitably to\r\nsolve global problems and to buttress collective\r\nsecurity. Ecuador again commits itself to work\r\nceaselessly to attain those noble goals.\r\nMr. Belkhadem (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): This\r\nsession is taking place at a time when there is a new\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\ninternational awareness of the global nature of\r\nproblems of peace, security and development. The\r\nbarbaric terrorist attacks against the United States on\r\n11 September, and their alarming consequences, made\r\nit clear that terrorism is now a factor for worldwide\r\npolitical and economic destabilization.\r\nAlgeria has conveyed its deepest sympathy to the\r\nfamilies of the victims of those horrible acts. It did so\r\nwith all the more sincerity and feeling because for\r\nmore than a decade Algeria itself has been enduring the\r\nhorrors of terrorism. The international reaction to this\r\ndevastating scourge has been a heartening collective\r\nwake-up call. Mobilization and multifaceted action to\r\ncombat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is\r\nnow worldwide. In that regard, Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) unquestionably constituted a\r\nmajor breakthrough. It was adopted under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter and obliges all States unequivocally and\r\ndutifully to outlaw terrorist activities and their\r\nsupporters and sponsors, wherever they may be.\r\nAlgeria is fully cooperating with the international\r\ncommunity in the implementation of that universal\r\ncollective endeavour. Algeria stresses how important it\r\nis that the resolution be strictly implemented and\r\nreaffirms the imperative need for universal adherence\r\nto existing international anti-terrorism instruments and\r\nfor the ratification of relevant regional instruments.\r\nAlgeria believes, inter alia, that the adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive convention to combat terrorism is\r\nessential. For its part, my country is ready to cooperate\r\nwith other nations to achieve this as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\nThe dangers that terrorism poses to global peace\r\nand security highlight the need for a ruthless struggle\r\nagainst it, in particular through dismantling bases and\r\nnetworks, draining sources of financing, cooperating in\r\nexchanging information and providing proper\r\nequipment to countries that are victims of terrorism,\r\nand reviewing permissive national legislation regarding\r\nthe right of asylum as well as the justification for\r\nmurder or planning criminal activities to be committed\r\nin third countries.\r\nWhile the urgency of this struggle has made it\r\npossible to achieve notable progress in a few weeks,\r\nwe must be unanimous in our determination if we are\r\nto confront the roots of terrorism — that is, we must\r\naddress the problems that constitute a breeding ground\r\nfor extremism and intolerance throughout the world.\r\nThis means that Islam, a religion of peace and\r\ntolerance, cannot in any way be associated with\r\nterrorism, which is alien to its values. It also\r\nunderscores the importance of ensuring that the anti-\r\nterrorist struggle is not aimed at any one country,\r\nreligion, culture or civilization.\r\nThe United Nations, which has often diagnosed\r\nand analysed the state of our world, has rightly\r\nemphasized that problems tend to be of an economic,\r\npolitical and social nature and that their causes are both\r\nnational and international. The denial of the right of\r\npeoples to self-determination, the exacerbated\r\nphenomena of exclusion and poverty, the persistence of\r\neconomic imbalances, the intensification of social\r\ninequalities, the continued deterioration of the\r\nenvironment and the pursuit of the arms race are all\r\nproblems awaiting solutions and concrete measures\r\nthat, in many cases, United Nations forums have\r\nalready defined and adopted in many cases adopted.\r\nThe commitments undertaken recently to make\r\nglobalization a factor of integration rather than of\r\nexclusion — in particular the objectives enshrined in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration — take on full importance\r\nhere, since they highlight the urgent need for effective\r\nmeasures to build a stable and united world on a solid\r\nfoundation. Today, reality amply demonstrates that\r\nglobalization, despite its enormous potential and\r\nopportunities, has not yet yielded the expected results\r\nwith regard to the universal improvement of living\r\nconditions. The processes to which it leads have too\r\noften widened the existing cracks within societies and\r\nexacerbated differences among nations. This has\r\nencouraged marginal groups to exploit the difficult\r\nsocial situations to which many peoples are subject and\r\nto promote isolationism and rejection of the other.\r\nThe Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by\r\nthe Durban World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\r\nprovide a framework for inspiration and action to build\r\nmore harmonious and fraternal relations among people.\r\nFirst of all, there is a need at the United Nations\r\nlevel to set aright unacceptable situations of injustice\r\nand denial of rights. In Palestine, the serious situation\r\nthat prevails as a result of the continued Israeli\r\noccupation and its oppressive practices requires the\r\nattention of the entire international community. It\r\ndemands urgent action to put an end to the daily trials\r\nof the Palestinian people, who are subjected to a\r\ndeliberate policy by the Israeli army of intimidation,\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nabuse and murder. This policy is likely to endanger the\r\nresumption of the peace process, taking the entire\r\nregion to the brink of a conflagration with incalculable\r\nconsequences.\r\nGiven the situation, Algeria reaffirms its total\r\nsolidarity with the Palestinian people and their\r\ninalienable right to an independent State with Al-Quds\r\nal-Sharif as its capital. Algeria urgently calls upon the\r\ninternational community to ensure the protection of the\r\nPalestinian people by sending international observers\r\nto the region.\r\nAlgeria wishes to emphasize that only a solution\r\nbased on international legality — in particular Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) — as\r\nwell as on the principle of land for peace, adopted at\r\nthe Madrid Conference, can ensure just and lasting\r\npeace and security for all the peoples of the region, as\r\nChairman Yasser Arafat indicated in his speech this\r\nmorning. Algeria would also like to reaffirm its\r\nsolidarity with the brotherly peoples of Syria and\r\nLebanon for the restoration of their lands still under\r\nIsraeli occupation. In addition, Algeria welcomes the\r\ndecision of the Security Council to lift the sanctions on\r\nthe brotherly people of Sudan and seizes the\r\nopportunity to renew its appeal for the lifting of the\r\nsanctions on the brotherly Iraqi and Libyan peoples.\r\nThe situation in the Western Sahara, where the\r\nsettlement process has been halted for more than a year\r\nand a half, is also a source of great concern and a factor\r\nof instability in the Maghreb and in Africa as a whole.\r\nThe United Nations Mission for the Referendum in\r\nWestern Sahara (MINURSO) has not been able to\r\ncontinue the implementation of the settlement plan of\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU), though it had been accepted by the two\r\nparties to the conflict, the Kingdom of Morocco and\r\nthe Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguia el-\r\nHamra y del Río de Oro (POLISARIO), in particular\r\nbecause of the many challenges that followed the\r\nidentification stage.\r\nAction by the United Nations in the Western\r\nSahara, carried out through MINURSO since 1991,\r\nshould be commended, and the progress made within\r\nthe framework of the implementation of the settlement\r\nplan — in particular the identification of the electoral\r\nbody — should be maintained and consolidated. Here,\r\nthe two parties should be reminded of their obligation\r\nto cooperate openly and sincerely with MINURSO, to\r\nconclude the referendum process and to call upon the\r\nbodies of the United Nations that deal with this issue to\r\nstrictly respect their mandate.\r\nThe unswerving position of Algeria on the issue\r\nof the Western Sahara stems from its dedication to\r\ninternational legality and to respect for the right of\r\npeople to self-determination. Algeria therefore supports\r\nthe holding of a free and transparent referendum,\r\norganized by the United Nations that will allow this\r\npeople to decide on its destiny. Any effort or initiative\r\nto settle that dispute must be part of the framework of\r\ninternational legality and, in particular, of the\r\nresolutions on decolonization adopted by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nElsewhere on the African continent, the\r\ndetermination of African peoples and leaders and the\r\nsupport of the international community are starting to\r\nbear fruit in the areas of conflict prevention and\r\nsettlement. The Peace Agreement concluded in Algiers\r\nin June 2000 between Ethiopia and Eritrea put an end\r\nto a devastating two-year war between those two\r\nbrotherly African countries and opened the way to a\r\npeaceful settlement of their dispute. The progress made\r\nsince the full deployment of the United Nations\r\nMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea attests to the\r\ncommitment of those two countries to strengthening\r\nthe basis for a lasting peace and for mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation.\r\nSimilarly, the implementation of the Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement, which has long been plagued by\r\nnumerous difficulties, is now well under way. The\r\ninternational community must pursue its efforts to\r\nmake the settlement process irreversible and to\r\nfacilitate the inter-Congolese dialogue.\r\nAfrica also welcomes the progress made in Sierra\r\nLeone in the implementation of its disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration programmes, which\r\nhave been made possible by the courageous and\r\ndetermined action of the United Nations Mission in\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nDespite the positive developments that have\r\noccurred in Angola there, UNITA continues to sow\r\ndeath and destruction among the people of that country.\r\nA return to security will require strict respect by all\r\nStates for the punitive measures laid down by the\r\nSecurity Council against UNITA.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nFinally, regarding recent events in Burundi, my\r\ncountry welcomes the decision of the parties to the\r\nconflict there to establish a transitional Government\r\nthat guarantees the participation of all the inhabitants\r\nof that country in the management of their own affairs.\r\nWe hail the important role played by Mr. Nelson\r\nMandela in achieving understanding among the parties\r\nin Burundi in the implementation of the Arusha\r\nAgreement.\r\nThe end of the cold war eased the climate of\r\nsuspicion and distrust that permeated international\r\nrelations and was replaced by a measure of optimism\r\nbased on new prospects. We hope that this optimism\r\nwill signal an end to outdated doctrines and theories of\r\nnuclear deterrence and the balance of terror and that it\r\nwill open the way to a bold approach to guaranteeing\r\nthe security of all States. Given this qualitative\r\ntransformation in international relations, our hope of\r\nseeing our planet forever free of nuclear weapons and\r\nother weapons of mass destruction is indeed\r\nstrengthened.\r\nThe need to establish renewable international\r\ncooperation based on mutual interests and shared duties\r\nand responsibilities is more urgent than ever before.\r\nThis new spirit must become an incentive for launching\r\ncomprehensive initiatives to seek a genuine\r\nunderstanding of the problems plaguing the entire\r\nworld. In brief, we must prepare for international\r\ngovernance that truly reflects the requirements of\r\nrationality, transparency, justice, democratic\r\nparticipation and responsibility, without which any\r\ndiscussion of a new world order is meaningless and of\r\nno use to humanity.\r\nThe progress that has been achieved at the\r\npolitical and economic levels in several regions and\r\ncountries must be consolidated and enhanced through\r\nthe international promotion of good governance. In this\r\nrespect, the direct and indirect threats to sustainable\r\ndevelopment that jeopardize the survival of our planet\r\nrequire us all to mobilize on a vast scale in the context\r\nof the World Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nUrgent measures must be taken to halt the devastating\r\neffects of various means and types of production and\r\nconsumption that have become untenable. These must\r\nbe transformed in a qualitative way, taking into account\r\nthe needs of mankind as a whole.\r\nIn the same vein, the ministerial conference of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization that opened in Doha two\r\ndays ago and the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, to be held in a few months\r\nin Mexico, are promising prospects for the lasting\r\nresumption of growth in the developing countries and\r\nfor improving the living standards of their peoples.\r\nFour months ago, African countries, meeting at\r\nthe 37th Assembly of Heads of State and Government\r\nof the Organization of African Unity in Lusaka, clearly\r\nexpressed Africa’s official response to the new needs\r\nand aspirations of its peoples through their solemn\r\nlaunching of the transitional process towards the\r\nAfrican Union and their adoption of the New African\r\nInitiative. These steps form an integral part of the\r\nreform process undertaken over the past few years by\r\nthe African countries at the national, regional and\r\ncontinental levels to bring Africa into step with an\r\never-changing world.\r\nAware of the magnitude of the challenges facing\r\nthe continent and of the need to acquire a global\r\nintegrated programme for the social and economic\r\nrecovery of the continent, African leaders at the Lusaka\r\nsummit adopted a plan that was conceived by and for\r\nAfrica. Algeria, which actively participated in the\r\ncreation and drafting of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrican Development, believes that this programme\r\nwill open the way to practical solutions to the\r\neconomic and social problems of Africa. Thus, in order\r\nfor our Organization to bolster its credibility and\r\neffectiveness, to address the great changes on the\r\ninternational scene and to be more responsive to the\r\naspirations of this global village, it must earnestly\r\npursue its transformation and be more open to the\r\nworld and to itself.\r\nIt is also necessary to ensure greater democracy\r\nand fairness within the United Nations system, in\r\nparticular in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. The Security Council incontestably requires a\r\ndrastic reform of its processes and membership. In a\r\nword, the United Nations must serve the great family\r\nof mankind as a whole.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hor Namhong, Senior Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nCambodia.\r\nMr. Hor Namhong (Cambodia): I wish to join\r\nother representatives in congratulating you, Sir, on\r\nyour unanimous election as President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nunder your able guidance the work of this General\r\nAssembly session will be another milestone on the new\r\ninternational scene, particularly in confronting the new\r\nchallenges facing our world, especially after the\r\nextremely tragic terrorist attacks of 11 September on\r\nthe World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon\r\nin Washington, D.C.\r\nI believe that the world has completely changed\r\nsince the attacks against the United States of America,\r\nthe deadliest terrorist attacks ever committed, in which\r\nso many innocent lives were lost. These acts of\r\nterrorism shook the world as the images of destruction\r\nwere broadcast live. They were undoubtedly crimes\r\nagainst humanity. We must strongly condemn these\r\nterrorist acts. We cannot forget those who lost their\r\nlives and the families of the victims. In this regard, I\r\nwish to extend, on behalf of the people and the Royal\r\nGovernment of Cambodia, our most sincere\r\ncondolences to the families of the innocent victims and\r\nthe Government of the United States of America.\r\nCambodia fully supports the United Nations\r\nresolutions condemning the acts of terrorism against\r\nthe United States. Cambodia also fully endorses the\r\ninternational efforts in combating terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations. Cambodia is disturbed,\r\nhowever, over the loss of innocent civilian lives as a\r\nresult of the bombings in Afghanistan. We must do\r\neverything possible to avoid civilian casualties and loss\r\nof life.\r\nIn order to find solutions to the current problems\r\nfacing our world, I believe that we need to look into\r\nnot only the root causes of terrorism but also the other\r\ncontributing factors that are confronting the world\r\ntoday. First, we need to look for a just and lasting\r\npeace in the Middle East, in particular a solution to the\r\nPalestine problem. We need to respect the fundamental\r\nright of self-determination of the Palestinian people. In\r\nthis regard, Cambodia supports the creation of a\r\nPalestinian State as early as possible. One may argue\r\nthat the present situation in the world may have opened\r\na window of opportunity for finding solutions to the\r\nongoing conflict in the Middle East. I believe that all\r\nparties concerned should, and I hope that they will,\r\ngive peace in the region a chance, which is the way to\r\novercome the lingering conflict in the region.\r\nSecondly, the increase in poverty in the world is\r\nanother crucial problem that must be addressed with\r\nsome sense of urgency and collective responsibility.\r\nPoverty is unquestionably one of the major causes of\r\nthe problems in the world today. I think that all nations\r\nmust join hands to fight poverty throughout the world.\r\nAt the same time, we must work to reduce the\r\nwidening gap between the developed and developing\r\ncountries.\r\nIn this regard, it is important for us to recall last\r\nyear’s Millennium Declaration, whose main thrust was\r\na war on poverty in the most comprehensive and most\r\ninclusive manner possible. For the developing\r\ncountries, one of the main challenges in the war on\r\npoverty is managing the negative side of an irreversible\r\nprocess of globalization. The key question is how to\r\nbest integrate ourselves into an ever-accelerating\r\nprocess of globalization so that the developing\r\ncountries will not be left out or continue to be further\r\nmarginalized. The process of globalization is a reality\r\nwithout precedent, and no country in this world is\r\nimmune to, or able to opt out of, the process.\r\nAt the same time, we should work collectively\r\ntowards minimizing the negative impact of\r\nglobalization, which would enable the developing\r\ncountries to pursue sustainable development and\r\npoverty reduction and provide the necessary tools for\r\nthe people to improve their standards of living.\r\nMoreover, we think that if there is no mechanism or\r\nprinciple which is universally accepted in order to\r\nmanage globalization, the gap between the developed\r\nand developing countries will further widen in the\r\nfuture. This is a problem of human security, which the\r\ninternational community must consider finding\r\nappropriate ways and means of addressing.\r\nThirdly, another side effect of poverty is the\r\ngrowing epidemic of HIV/AIDS worldwide, across\r\nregions and continents, affecting mostly the poor and\r\nthe developing countries. Therefore, we believe that\r\nthe rich, developed countries should do more to help in\r\nthe fight against the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nFourthly, as a contributing factor for combating\r\nterrorism, we should attempt to find practical solutions\r\nto the growing threat of the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons and the illegal trade of small arms and light\r\nweapons around the globe. In this context, Cambodia\r\nfully agrees with the Secretary-General’s statement at\r\nthe Millennium Summit that the issues of nuclear\r\nweapons and illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons should be given the highest priority on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda in the area of arms control and\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\ndisarmament. In this context, Cambodia wishes to call\r\nupon all countries to respect all the nuclear-weapons-\r\nrelated treaties, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile\r\n(ABM) Treaty. Cambodia strongly believes that the\r\ninternational community should work towards a\r\ngradual reduction of nuclear stockpiles to a minimal\r\nlevel, and non-proliferation and non-production of such\r\nweapons in the future, which should be the basis for\r\nbuilding and maintaining a peaceful, safe and nuclear-\r\nfree world.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs a country that has suffered considerably from\r\nthe proliferation of small arms, Cambodia welcomes\r\nthe adoption of the Programme of Action at the\r\nconclusion of the United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects. In this regard, I congratulate the United\r\nNations on taking bold steps in addressing this vitally\r\nimportant issue. Since 1998, the Royal Government of\r\nCambodia has carried out a nationwide campaign to\r\naddress the problems regarding such arms. So far more\r\nthat 120,000 small arms and light weapons have been\r\nconfiscated, and more than 50 percent of them have\r\nbeen destroyed in the framework of an operation\r\nnamed “Flames for Peace.”\r\nFifthly, for the United Nations to play a greater\r\nrole in addressing the increasing number of complex\r\nproblems that are now arising, the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia is of the view that the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council must be reformed so that they\r\nbecome more effective and more efficient. As we may\r\nrecall, one of the most important pledges contained in\r\nlast year’s Millennium Declaration was the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. While progress\r\nin the structural and procedural aspects of the General\r\nAssembly are vitally important, we must not lose sight\r\nof the primary objective of this exercise, which is to\r\nreturn to the General Assembly its original function as\r\nthe chief deliberative and representative body of the\r\nUnited Nations. In other words, the international\r\ncommunity, especially the United Nations as a whole,\r\nmust play a constructive and proactive role, without\r\nexclusivity, including in the struggle against terrorism.\r\nMr. Shaghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Vice\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nI also believe that the current global situation\r\njustifies a call for a constructive and timely reform of\r\nthe Security Council, which must reflect the realities\r\nand needs of the world today. The Security Council\r\nmust be reformed to be made more representative,\r\nmore democratic and more effective in its decision-\r\nmaking processes. Its membership and structure,\r\npassed down since 1945, are inarguably outdated and\r\nno longer reflect the political, economic, social and\r\ndemographic realities of our time or, apparently, the\r\ngrowing issues of human security.\r\nAs the United Nations Charter mandates the\r\nSecurity Council’s responsibility in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, it is important for us\r\nto ensure that the interests of all nations are sufficiently\r\nreflected in the Council’s composition and voting\r\nprocedures. It is unacceptable, however, that the two\r\nthirds of the world’s population residing in the\r\ndeveloping countries are not equitably represented in\r\nthe Council. Such practices could jeopardize the\r\nCouncil’s credibility in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. In this regard,\r\nCambodia supports the decision of the non-aligned\r\ncountries in favour of an additional increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent and non-permanent members and\r\nin particular reiterates its strong support for Japan,\r\nGermany and India as candidates for permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that we are living in a\r\nfast-changing world in which the rapid pace of\r\nglobalization and growing interdependence are the\r\norder of the day. Peace, stability and prosperity are\r\ninterrelated and affect all nations and peoples on this\r\nplanet, especially following the extremely tragic\r\nterrorist attacks in September. It is therefore essential\r\nthat we work together to build a genuine community of\r\nnations in which the gap between the developed and\r\nthe developing countries is reduced; in which the threat\r\nof terrorism and nuclear annihilation are eliminated; in\r\nwhich the danger of a global HIV/AIDS epidemic is\r\nmitigated; and in which poverty is alleviated. This can\r\ncome about only through the development of a more\r\ngenuine cooperation, the fostering of enhanced mutual\r\nrespect, the cultivation of greater tolerance, the\r\npromotion of better understanding and the emergence\r\nof a broader spirit of true union among nations in a\r\nworld that works on behalf of all.\r\nI strongly believe that we can achieve all this\r\nthrough collective will and actions that will help us to\r\nusher in a new and brighter future for our world — a\r\nworld free of terrorism, a world of stability, peace,\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nsecurity, development and prosperity for all peoples in\r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFinally, I am pleased to express, on behalf of the\r\nRoyal Government of Cambodia, our very warm\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to\r\na second term in the noble post of Secretary-General. I\r\ndo believe that, with his dedication and long-standing\r\nexperience in dealing with the many challenges faced\r\nby the United Nations, the Secretary-General will\r\ncertainly achieve more success for the sake of peace\r\nand stability for all nations Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency Mrs. Lila Ratsifandriamanana,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Madagascar.\r\nMrs. Ratsifandriamanana (Madagascar) (spoke\r\nin French): It is with strong feelings that we return\r\ntoday to New York to find it still darkened by\r\nmourning yet ever brightened by the aura of freedom.\r\nNew York is the capital of international diplomacy, a\r\ncrossroads of cultures and civilizations, a cosmopolitan\r\ncity in which nations co-exist. New York is a city\r\nwhose heart will forever hold the memory of the\r\nvictims of the human folly of 11 September 2001.\r\nTo the people and Government of the United\r\nStates, under the enlightened leadership of President\r\nGeorge Bush, we reiterate our deepest condolences. We\r\nalso thank them warmly for their welcome and for the\r\nfacilities placed at our disposal.\r\nOn behalf of the delegation of Madagascar, from\r\nthis United Nations rostrum I convey to Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo our sincerest congratulations on his election\r\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. To\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, we pay well-\r\ndeserved tribute for the success of the Millennium\r\nAssembly.\r\nTo Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization, we express our pride at the important\r\ndistinction he has recently been awarded. The Nobel\r\nPeace Prize that he has received is both a recognition\r\nof his unassailable competence and dedication as well\r\nas a reflection of the value of the United Nations and\r\nthe trust placed in it by the entire world.\r\nOur Organization is being confronted with new\r\nconcerns every day. It is called on to keep up with the\r\npace of international change in order to better fulfil its\r\nmission as a regulator of inter-State relations, a\r\nfacilitator of negotiations and a catalyst of\r\ndevelopment. The United Nations remains the supreme\r\ndecision-making body and the main guarantor of world\r\npeace and security.\r\nMadagascar supports profound reform and a\r\nstreamlining of the Organization’s institutional\r\nstructure in order to improve its performance.\r\nMadagascar remains convinced and confident,\r\nhowever, that our Organization is still a privileged\r\nplatform for the exchange and harmonization of views.\r\nCreating together a climate of world peace and\r\nharmony; struggling in unity against poverty, the AIDS\r\npandemic, transnational crime and environmental\r\ndegradation; building in concert a better future for the\r\ncoming generation, our children, who are tomorrow’s\r\ndecision-makers — these were the expectations voiced\r\nat the Millennium Summit in this very Hall. It was an\r\nambitious millennium, given the prospects and\r\nprogrammes of action projected up to the year 2015,\r\nand one of multiple challenges, given that objectives\r\nremain to be achieved and that we have a long road\r\nahead of us. Above all, it was a millennium for taking\r\nstock and moving forward, since the situation of human\r\nand economic development calls on us to rise to its\r\nexpectations and to overcome its hurdles.\r\nA world of well-being is what our children need\r\ntoday and tomorrow above all. The devotion of my\r\ncountry and my people to all questions relating to\r\nchildren is seen in our genuine commitment to\r\ninternational conventions. On 16 July 2001,\r\nMadagascar ratified International Labour Organization\r\nConvention No. 182 on the Prohibition and Immediate\r\nAction for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child\r\nLabour. The Hague Convention on the Intercountry\r\nAdoption of Children is currently being considered by\r\nour Parliament. The implementation of the law of 1999\r\non paedophilia complements the Optional Protocol that\r\nwe signed in September 2000 regarding the sale of\r\nchildren, child prostitution and child pornography.\r\nWe welcome enthusiastically the decision to hold\r\nin May 2002 the Summit on the future of children. In\r\nview of our intention to participate in that event, a\r\nnational parliament of children has just been\r\nestablished this year.\r\nThe family must remain the basic core of society,\r\nthe foundation of the nation, a source of human dignity\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nand the guarantor of stable social development.\r\nConsequently, the family must be protected, as must be\r\nthe values associated with it.\r\nMadagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean, thus\r\nfar little affected by the AIDS pandemic, is nonetheless\r\nnot indifferent to this scourge. A strategy and a\r\nprogramme to prevent and combat AIDS, within an\r\nestablished institutional framework, are being pursued\r\nby all State and non-State institutions in the country.\r\nHaving participated actively in the United Nations\r\nspecial session on AIDS in June 2001, Madagascar\r\nfully supports the resolutions adopted at that meeting.\r\nSince Africa has a wealth of medicinal plants, any\r\nresearch in this connection will benefit from consistent\r\nsupport.\r\nAfrica pledges resolutely, and with the full\r\nawareness of its responsibilities, to take its own destiny\r\nin hand. Positive development indicators are imminent,\r\nand are appreciated. Continental integration is\r\nunderway within an effective African Union. Regional\r\nmechanisms for African conflict management and\r\nprevention are already operational. The New African\r\nInitiative, including long-term development\r\nprogrammes for our continent, has benefited from the\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nNonetheless, in the context of globalization, the\r\neconomic and commercial rules of the game are not\r\nalways in the developing countries’ favour. We deplore\r\nthe widening gap between the economies of the\r\ncountries of the South and those of the countries of the\r\nNorth. The World Trade Organization, which is\r\nmeeting right now in Qatar, should further encourage\r\nthe advanced countries to give greater trade\r\npreferences to the developing countries. Given the\r\nnegative impact of a possible complete liberalization of\r\ntrade, the economy of the least developed countries\r\nmust be taken into consideration by the international\r\ncommunity, because any new multilateral contract\r\nengenders binding obligations.\r\nIntegration within regional markets will clearly\r\nmake it possible for our countries to adapt steadily to\r\nthe demands and constraints of the world market, while\r\npromoting intra-regional and South-South exchanges.\r\nWe expect of regional cooperation a concrete transfer\r\nof technology and know-how and a harmonization of\r\nstandards.\r\nMadagascar’s economy has followed the\r\ndynamics of growth thanks to steadfast national efforts\r\nand an enterprising partnership. Madagascar joined the\r\nfree trade zone of the Common Market for Eastern and\r\nSouthern Africa (COMESA), on 31 October 2001. We\r\nhave benefited from the Initiative of the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and from the\r\nrescheduling or cancellation of our debts by a number\r\nof our creditors. We are signatories of the Cotonou\r\nAgreement of July 2001, and are beneficiaries of the\r\nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). All of\r\nthis bears witness to the confidence that the\r\ninternational community has in our country.\r\nHowever, out of solidarity with all low-income\r\ncountries, we believe that there is an urgent need to\r\nreview international policy regarding official\r\ndevelopment assistance. We welcome the holding in\r\nBrussels last May of the United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Least Developed Countries. The time has come for\r\nconcrete action, so that the objective of reducing\r\npoverty by half by the 2015 can become a reality.\r\nMadagascar has always been attentive to and\r\nconcerned by situations of international conflict, and\r\nmore particularly those that affect the African\r\ncontinent and the Indian Ocean area. In the framework\r\nof the Organization of African Unity and of the\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, we have\r\nsupported the Camoros in their process of national\r\nreconciliation and their return to constitutional\r\nnormalcy. We welcome the draft constitution prepared\r\nby the Tripartite Commission, which included different\r\ntrends and factions of the three reunited islands, and\r\nthe decision to hold the referendum next December.\r\nIt goes without saying that the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict claims our full attention. We believe it is\r\nimperative that a special session be convened on this\r\nquestion by the United Nations and also that an\r\ninternational force be deployed to protect the innocent\r\nvictims. We support the Palestinian people in its\r\nstruggle for independence and sovereignty. We also\r\nwelcome the continuation of peace negotiations\r\nbetween the Government of Israel and the Palestine\r\nLiberation Organization. The principle of land for\r\npeace must be respected. This must be done in keeping\r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council.\r\nAfghanistan, a den of extreme poverty and hotbed\r\nof tension, has recently become a site of war. While the\r\nfight against terrorism is legitimate and is the\r\nresponsibility of all States Member of our\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nOrganization, support for refugees and the civilian\r\nvictims of war is a duty that shouts out at all of us.\r\nHumanitarian intervention is therefore imperative.\r\nMadagascar reiterates its commitment to\r\ndisarmament efforts, an essential element of the United\r\nNations strategy for peace and security, according to\r\nthe Secretary-General’s most recent report (A/56/1).\r\nMy delegation welcomes the holding in July 2001 of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. Of\r\ncourse, we support the first global Programme of\r\nAction that was adopted. My country reaffirms the\r\nurgent need to implement the conventions of the United\r\nNations that condemn the production, proliferation and\r\nillicit sale of weapons. Madagascar is a party to several\r\nmultilateral treaties regarding disarmament. The Treaty\r\nof Pelindaba, which makes Africa a nuclear-weapons-\r\nfree zone, has just been ratified by our Parliament.\r\nOur reunion here in this Hall, in this large United\r\nNations family, reminds us that we are survivors, and\r\nthat it is only a matter of time before the terrorist\r\nsword of Damocles dangerously suspended over our\r\nheads, may again perpetrate its odious carnage. The\r\nfact that we have been spared compels us to mobilize\r\nand to coordinate a united and merciless struggle\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nMadagascar, my country and its people, coming\r\nfrom a mixture of many cultural, religious and ethnic\r\nbackgrounds, reiterates its condemnation of the\r\nterrorist barbarity that struck a sister nation, with\r\nvictims of all nationalities having perished in the\r\nattacks of 11 September 2001.\r\nTerrorism is the very negation of everything that\r\nwe, as leaders of our different nations and institutions\r\ngathered here, do to make of this world a universe of\r\nlaw, humanity and lasting peace.\r\nMadagascar has already begun the process of\r\nratifying the 12 conventions against terrorism, and last\r\nOctober signed the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Likewise,\r\nwe will immediately proceed to sign the Protocol\r\nagainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in\r\nFirearms. We support the draft comprehensive\r\nconvention against terrorism, submitted by India,\r\nwhich is based on existing conventions, with the\r\nemphasis placed on concrete measures that member\r\ncountries would be able to apply.\r\nInternational cooperation in police and judicial\r\ninvestigations must be consolidated, taking into\r\naccount exchanges of information on major trafficking\r\nactivity. This would require harmonization of\r\nlegislation and the establishment of multilateral\r\noperational structures for the prevention and\r\nsuppression of transnational crimes.\r\nThe threat of bioterrorism has in recent times\r\ncreated a psychosis of collective fear that has spread\r\nthroughout the world. This means that the international\r\ncommunity must design and urgently put in place\r\neffective protective measures against this danger. The\r\nConvention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is now\r\nbefore the Parliament of Madagascar for ratification. It\r\nis now imperative that we think deeply and on an\r\nongoing basis about the subject of terrorism.\r\nCombating terrorism also means identifying and\r\nunderstanding the causes of this scourge and\r\neradicating the evil at its very roots. In order to halt its\r\nramifications we must remove all sources of support,\r\nwhich involves destroying the many laboratories and\r\nbases for logistical backup and cutting off financing,\r\nweapons acquisition, fund-raising and proselytizing.\r\nOn the basis of that conviction, we are pleased\r\nthat our Organization has adopted the Programme of\r\nAction for dialogue among civilizations.\r\nIn accordance with the United Nations resolution\r\nmaking 2001 the International Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, last October Madagascar organized a\r\nworkshop in which all those involved in our country’s\r\ndevelopment participated. From the discussions\r\nemerged the notion that traditional cultures could serve\r\nas a point of reference for modern nations to design a\r\ncode of peaceful behaviour. The prevention of terrorist\r\nacts could also be complemented by educational and\r\ntraining programmes and information programmes on\r\nthe culture of peace.\r\nWe have proposed the establishment at the\r\nnational level of a non-aggression pact among the\r\ncountry’s religious institutions in order to head off any\r\ndangers of religious war or other conflicts. This\r\ninitiative deserves to be expanded to a wider scale in\r\norder to ensure a climate of confidence and calm. We\r\nmust have the courage to denounce the excesses of\r\nfanaticism and religious extremism, which endanger\r\nour common values.\r\nThe time has now come for dialogue. It is not too\r\nlate to become aware of the value of dialogue. Having\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\na dialogue does not mean tolerating misdeeds, nor does\r\nit mean any complicity with criminals, who must be\r\npunished. Above all, having a dialogue means going\r\nbeyond terrorism through a new understanding of the\r\nconcept of enemy. It is now time to hear each other,\r\nwith mutual respect and in a climate of understanding\r\nthat takes the other into account. It is now time for\r\nshared responsibilities and continued harmonization of\r\nviews for the establishment of a world of trust.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Aboudramane\r\nSangaré, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Sangaré (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French):\r\nThe opening of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly has coincided with tragic events for the host\r\ncountry and for the entire world. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Côte d’Ivoire, allow me\r\nto take this opportunity to once again express our\r\nsincere condolences and sympathy to the Government\r\nand the people of the United States and to all the other\r\ncountries directly affected by this tragedy.\r\nThe delegation of Côte d’Ivoire is pleased to\r\nextend its warm congratulations to the President on his\r\nelection to lead the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. We would also like to extend our\r\ncongratulations to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nwho so ably guided the work of the Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fifth session.\r\nOur Organization and its Secretary-General have\r\njust been honoured with the prestigious Nobel Peace\r\nPrize. The Government and the people of Côte d’Ivoire\r\nhail this well-deserved international recognition of the\r\nimportance and quality of the work done by the\r\nOrganization under the leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nMy delegation extends to Mr. Kofi Annan its\r\nwarm and fraternal congratulations on his historic re-\r\nelection and on the greatly appreciated work he is\r\ndoing as the head of the United Nations. The\r\nrecognition he has just received is an illustration of the\r\nuniversal appreciation of his great qualities as a\r\ndiplomat and statesman, which he has put at the service\r\nof peace and development.\r\nIn organizing the Millennium Summit and in his\r\npersonal involvement in the holding of the special\r\nsession on HIV/AIDS, as well as his involvement in the\r\nspecial session on children, the Secretary-General has\r\nput back on the agenda the concerns of developing\r\ncountries in general, including those of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nIt is absolutely vital to sensitize the international\r\ncommunity on matters related to the fight against\r\npoverty and improving protection of the rights of\r\nwomen and children, to mention just two areas. Côte\r\nd’Ivoire would like to express its appreciation in this\r\nregard.\r\nFinally, the Government and the people of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire would like to express their gratitude to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his great\r\nunderstanding of, and support for, Côte d’Ivoire\r\nthroughout the very difficult times it has experienced\r\nsince the end of 1999. He demonstrated this once again\r\nby sending a personal representative to the forum on\r\nnational reconciliation that is now under way. The\r\nGovernment and the people of Côte d’Ivoire and the\r\ninternational community have great hopes for that\r\nforum, whose success will help all participants to\r\ndispel misunderstandings and help Côte d’Ivoire to\r\nresume its economic growth in order to be able to play\r\nits proper role.\r\nMy Government attaches great importance to a\r\nsocial policy aimed at combating poverty and meeting\r\nthe needs of all sectors of our population in the areas of\r\nhealth, education, employment and nutrition. As part of\r\nthat policy, a strategy document on poverty reduction is\r\nbeing prepared.\r\nBeginning in June 2002, a health insurance plan\r\nwill be in place as part of a national social security\r\nsystem. Through that plan everyone living in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire will be able to have health insurance,\r\nregardless of social status. The National Assembly\r\nadopted the necessary laws to that end on 9 October.\r\nNo effort will spared to ensure that we eliminate\r\nthe most serious social shortcomings as soon as\r\npossible. In that regard, our greatest ambition is for\r\ndevelopment and growth to reach the most remote\r\nregions and for the necessary basic services of running\r\nwater, electricity, schools and health-care centres to be\r\navailable to all the people in every village of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire. It is with this goal in mind that the\r\nGovernment has established a decentralization\r\nprogramme, thanks to which 58 departments of Côte\r\nd’Ivoire will be able to administer themselves and\r\noversee their own development on the basis of a\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nbudgetary packet granted to them annually through\r\nlegislative appropriations.\r\nIn order to attain these various objectives, the\r\nmacroeconomic framework will have to be improved\r\nthrough rigorous legal and budgetary measures and\r\nthrough good governance. Côte d’Ivoire is strongly\r\ndetermined to do its very best in this area.\r\nEnsuring the well-being of children and the\r\nprotection of their rights is a priority for my country.\r\nThe special session on children will take place in a few\r\nmonths, and our Government places great hope in the\r\nfact that it will give us an opportunity to clarify the\r\nactions we are taking in favour of children, particularly\r\nin the fight against cross-border trafficking in children.\r\nLast June, in this very Hall, States adopted new\r\nmeasures and initiatives in order to ensure the effective\r\nimplementation of the Beijing Declaration and\r\nPlatform for Action. Côte d’Ivoire endorses all of these\r\nrecommendations and will do everything possible\r\nwithin the framework of a renewal policy to reach as\r\nquickly as possible this objective, which is intended to\r\nensure equal opportunity among men and women.\r\nThe problem of HIV/AIDS has become one of the\r\nmajor concerns of the world today in general and for\r\nAfrica in particular. UN/AIDS statistics and those of\r\nmany other institutions state that throughout the world\r\nover 30 million people are infected, of which 1.2\r\nmillion are children. Africa represents only 10 per cent\r\nof the planet’s population; nevertheless, since the\r\nbeginning of this epidemic, 83 per cent of all deaths\r\ndue to AIDS have fallen to Africa. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has rightly stressed in his report of 16\r\nFebruary 2001, if the epidemic continues to grow at the\r\npresent rate, the most affected nations will see a\r\ndecrease of at least 25 per cent of their estimated\r\neconomic growth over the next 20 years. For this\r\nreason we are very glad to see the setting up of a\r\nGlobal AIDS and Health Fund at the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General’s initiative. It would also be a good\r\ntime to set up mechanisms promoting the exchange of\r\nexperience among those countries which have managed\r\nto halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and those which are\r\nstill seeking solutions to it.\r\nNo country can flourish if international peace and\r\nsecurity are threatened, which is why Côte d’Ivoire is\r\nextremely concerned by an arms race which dares not\r\nspeak its name. As party to the Pelindaba Treaty, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire welcomes the increasing number of treaties\r\nestablishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in different\r\nregions of the world.\r\nThe illicit proliferation and circulation of small\r\narms is another phenomenon that affects the African\r\ncontinent, and West Africa in particular. This\r\nphenomenon constitutes a permanent threat to peace\r\nand slows down development in this region, where\r\nover 15 million light weapons are circulating illegally.\r\nSince the end of the Second World War, the\r\ninternational community’s attention has focused on\r\nnuclear arms. However, it is conventional small arms\r\nthat continue to create millions of victims. Here we\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s opinion expressed in his\r\nMillennium Report: light weapons are indeed weapons\r\nof mass destruction. They exacerbate regional conflicts\r\nand contribute largely to the use of child soldiers. They\r\nkill women, youth and children. The insecurity that this\r\ncreates prohibits any possibility of smooth economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs Members of the General Assembly know, on\r\n31 October 1998 in Abuja, Nigeria, the Heads of State\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) decreed a moratorium aimed at reducing\r\nthe proliferation and circulation of light weapons in\r\nWest Africa. During the recent African summit, which\r\ntook place in Lusaka in July 2001, this moratorium was\r\nextended for a three-year period, starting on 5 July\r\n2001. This struggle can be efficient only if it is led by\r\nthe international community as a whole, and it has to\r\ninvolve, of course, weapons manufacturers, official\r\nusers and civil society. The United Nations Conference\r\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\r\nin All Its Aspects, which was held in New York from 9\r\nto 20 July 2001, is in our opinion headed in the right\r\ndirection. Côte d’Ivoire is greatly interested in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action adopted\r\nby the Conference.\r\nEight years ago the General Assembly decided to\r\nundertake the reform of the Security Council. As it\r\nstands at the moment, the Council cannot be seen as a\r\ndemocratic and representative body of all United\r\nNations Member States. The Council’s functions have\r\nto be reinforced so that it can continue acting\r\nefficiently as the United Nations body with the primary\r\nrole of ensuring the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. In order to do this, it is urgent and right\r\nthat the number of permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers be increased so that the composition of the\r\nCouncil is in line with the complexity of a world that\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nhas seen great development, both quantitative and\r\nqualitative, in international relations, the key aspect\r\nbeing the increased complexity of the problems to be\r\nsolved.\r\nIn our view, the expansion of the Council should\r\naim at re-adapting the whole mechanism of taking and\r\nimplementing decisions. This is why the exercise of the\r\nright of veto, equitable representation and expansion of\r\nmembership are all problems that have to be solved as\r\nsoon as possible, bearing in mind the vital urgency of\r\nreforming the Security Council so that all nations and\r\nregions of the world can be reflected within it. In this\r\nregard, the Organization of African Unity (OAU),\r\nwhich has now become the African Union, seeks two\r\npermanent seats and a total of five non-permanent seats\r\nfor the African continent. Of course, Côte d’Ivoire\r\nsupports this position.\r\nTo make the reform of the Security Council a\r\nreality, it is essential for Member States of the United\r\nNations, particularly the five permanent members of\r\nthe Council, to demonstrate their firm will and\r\ncommitment to carry out these reforms. The primary\r\nduty of the United Nations, after all, is to preserve and\r\npromote peace throughout the world based on\r\ndemocratic principles. But can there be peace without\r\njustice or equality in relations between nations?\r\nThe world as a whole and the African continent in\r\nparticular, has been torn apart by regional conflicts and\r\ncivil wars that threaten international peace and\r\nsecurity. Various solutions proposed by the\r\ninternational community for laying down arms and for\r\nhalting the suffering of civilian populations have not\r\nyet, unfortunately, produced the expected results. We\r\nneed to find innovative and imaginative solutions that\r\nare political, not military. In this perspective, we\r\nwelcome the Brahimi report on peacekeeping\r\noperations, and we hope that its recommendations are\r\napplied as soon as possible. The impetus that the\r\nBrahimi report is intended to give to peacekeeping\r\noperations has to be encouraged and maintained.\r\nThe events of 11 September 2001 confirm the\r\nCôte d’Ivoire in its condemnation of all terrorist acts as\r\ncriminal and unjustifiable, wherever they may be\r\ncarried out and whoever the perpetrators may be,\r\nparticularly those that violate the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations, pose a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security and jeopardize friendly\r\nrelations between countries. This is why the\r\nGovernment of Côte d’Ivoire welcomes and firmly\r\nencourages the rapid conclusion of a general\r\nconvention on international terrorism. Such a\r\nconvention would undoubtedly contribute greatly to\r\nfighting against this scourge and would reinforce an\r\ninternational legal regime on terrorism. Côte d’Ivoire\r\nwill always respect the international commitments it\r\nhas assumed since its independence. We also feel that\r\nthe rule of law should be given top priority.\r\nWe would like to pay a well-deserved tribute here\r\nto the International Law Commission for its valuable\r\ncontribution to the development and codification of\r\ninternational law, in particular law relating to the\r\nresponsibility of States, diplomatic protection,\r\nunilateral acts of States, reservations to treaties and\r\ninternational responsibility in case of damaging\r\nconsequences arising from activities that are not\r\nprohibited by international law.\r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, the role\r\nof the United Nations is crucial. Our Organization\r\nrepresents, in fact, the collective conscience and is, as a\r\nrule, the policeman of the world, able to balance the\r\ninterests of States — those well endowed and those not\r\nso well endowed — within the new globalizing\r\neconomy. This regulatory role for the world economy\r\nand for international relations can be carried out fully\r\nonly in an environment of international peace, justice\r\nand equity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Fuad Mubarak Al-\r\nHinai, Chairman of the delegation of Oman.\r\nMr. Al-Hinai (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): I wish\r\nto express my sincere congratulations to Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo on his assumption of the presidency of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that his skills, competence and experience in\r\ninternational affairs will facilitate his task of leading\r\nand enriching the work of this session and of bringing\r\nit to a successful conclusion with the desired results.\r\nWe assure him of our delegation’s cooperation in the\r\nattainment of our shared objectives. We also want to\r\nexpress our sincerest thanks and appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, former Prime Minister\r\nof the friendly country of the Republic of Finland. We\r\nthank him for his efforts in directing the work of the\r\nlast session and the various special sessions that took\r\nplace during his term.\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nI want to take this opportunity to reiterate my\r\nsincerest congratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, and to the United Nations itself on being\r\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This is a well-deserved\r\naward and a mark of distinction for the contributions\r\nand the remarkable role played by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations in the maintenance and\r\nthe strengthening of international peace and security.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I also want to\r\nexpress my sincere congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on being granted a second term of office at the\r\nhead of the Organization. We intend to cooperate with\r\nhim in the attainment of our objectives, in the\r\nfulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and in the preparation and\r\ndevelopment of mechanisms for international\r\ncooperation in all fields.\r\nThe terrible events of 11 September that struck\r\nthis city, which is host to our Organization, have been\r\nforcefully condemned by my Government. This city\r\nhas attracted people from all over the world to a\r\ndialogue among civilizations through our international\r\nOrganization, and it therefore deserves to be a city of\r\npeace, not of terror and violence. We therefore take this\r\nopportunity to express once again our sincerest\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims and to the\r\nfriendly American people, whose sorrow we share. The\r\nworld was horrified by this dangerous turn of events —\r\nthe terrorist acts that struck such vital sites in New\r\nYork and Washington, taking many lives and leaving\r\ngreat destruction in their wake.\r\nWhile expressing our solidarity with the friendly\r\ncountry of the United States of America in its struggle\r\nagainst terrorism and in the defence of its territory and\r\nits people, and while we understand the reasons for the\r\nmilitary action being taken in Afghanistan, it is our\r\nfervent hope that every effort will be made to spare\r\ninnocent civilians the destruction and disasters of war\r\nso that they will not suffer further tragedies. For its\r\npart, the international community must play its role in\r\nprotecting the Afghan people.\r\nWe must not forget the peaceful means of dealing\r\nwith terrorism. Every sincere effort must be made to\r\neliminate the scourge of terrorism, which will destroy\r\ncivilization and all the achievements of humankind if it\r\nis not firmly confronted and if its causes are not\r\nexamined and uprooted. We stress that the use of\r\nmilitary force is not the best or the only solution for\r\neliminating terrorist groups. We appeal for a long-term\r\nvision to prevail so that all elements of the problem can\r\nbe dealt with. In this respect, we reiterate our\r\nwelcoming of the Egyptian proposal for an\r\ninternational conference on the fight against terrorism\r\nin order to arrive at an effective, binding international\r\ninstrument for States.\r\nIn the midst of this tragedy, we have heard certain\r\nopportunistic political circles in States and at the\r\ninternational level linking terrorism to Islam and\r\nMuslims. We fully and categorically reject this. Islam\r\nis a religion of mercy for all, a religion based on\r\nfraternity and tolerance. Muslims are the bearers of a\r\ncivilization, a culture and noble human and\r\nhumanitarian values. This is why the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference, at its extraordinary session\r\nheld in Doha, Qatar, last October, totally dissociated\r\nitself from all terrorism and reiterated its condemnation\r\nof terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The\r\nsession’s final communiqué reported in paragraph 3\r\nthat the Conference\r\n“stressed that such shameful terror acts are\r\nopposed to the tolerant, divine message of Islam\r\nwhich spurns aggression, calls for peace,\r\ncoexistence, tolerance and respect among people,\r\nhighly prizes the dignity of human life and\r\nprohibits killing of the innocent. It further\r\nrejected any attempts alleging the existence of\r\nany connection or relation between the Islamic\r\nfaith and the terrorist acts as such attempts are\r\nnot in the interest of the multilateral efforts to\r\ncombat terrorism and further damage relations\r\namong peoples of the world. It stressed as well\r\nthe need to undertake a joint effort to promote\r\ndialogue and create links or contacts between the\r\nIslamic world and the West in order to reach\r\nmutual understanding and build bridges of\r\nconfidence between the two civilizations.”\r\nIn this respect, my delegation wishes to\r\nemphasize its categorical rejection of the calls of all\r\nthose who would like to use this human disaster to\r\nsettle old scores and old political differences and to\r\nexpand the field of military action to other areas under\r\nthe pretext of fighting terrorism.\r\nWe are concerned about the humanitarian\r\nsituation of the friendly Afghan people. International\r\nhumanitarian organizations report that the military\r\naction taking place in Afghanistan has caused hundreds\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nof civilian casualties, that hundreds of thousands have\r\nbeen displaced and that the civilian population is\r\nexperiencing severe living conditions. Humanitarian\r\norganizations have warned that a humanitarian disaster\r\ncould be imminent for the Afghan people, especially\r\nwith the approach of winter. My country supports\r\ninternational efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the\r\nAfghan people, especially through the recent resolution\r\nadopted at the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the\r\nConference of the Islamic Conference with a view to\r\ncreating a fund for this purpose.\r\nThe series of difficult and painful events in the\r\npeace process in the Middle East on all its tracks and at\r\nall its stages, particularly regarding the Palestinian\r\naspect of the question, confirms that in order to arrive\r\nat a just, comprehensive and lasting peace it is\r\nnecessary to work towards implementing Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well\r\nas all other relevant United Nations resolutions that\r\ndemand the withdrawal of Israel from all Arab\r\nterritories occupied in 1967 and recognition of the\r\nlegitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and to the establishment of its own\r\nindependent State, with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital. This is a basic, just and legitimate demand for\r\nthe purpose of consolidating the pillars of peace and\r\nstability in the region. We express our full support for\r\nthese just demands of the Palestinian people who are\r\nfully entitled to use all means available to them to put\r\nan end to the Israeli occupation of their territory.\r\nThe Islamic countries also support the right of the\r\nPalestinian people because of the justness of their\r\ncause. Theirs is a legitimate right recognized and\r\nguaranteed by all international norms and instruments.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman invites the United Nations and\r\nthe Security Council to assume their full responsibility\r\nto have Israel implement all relevant Security Council\r\nand international resolutions and to stop the collective\r\npunishment of the Palestinian people.\r\nFollowing the Madrid Peace Conference, in 1991,\r\nthe region was full of hope and optimism. It seemed as\r\nthough peace were becoming a reality. Many\r\nagreements had been reached, from Oslo to Sharm el-\r\nSheikh, and all the parties had embarked on dialogue\r\nwith one another in circumstances that were not ideal.\r\nNonetheless, despite all the missteps, peace moved\r\nforward, because peace was the ultimate goal that\r\neveryone eagerly sought. The Arabs believed in peace.\r\nThey had agreed to it as an irreversible strategic option\r\nbased on the principles of Islam, which advocates\r\ntolerance and peace, and because they were convinced\r\nthat peace alone would make prosperity, stability and\r\ndevelopment possible.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman has therefore supported\r\nevery effort, with a view to achieving that much-\r\ndesired peace based on justice, fairness and the legality\r\nof international resolutions and the principle of land for\r\npeace. But Israel deviated from those principles,\r\ninventing its own concept of peace. Israel has used\r\nevery possible means of imposing its own kind of\r\npeace. Israel does not really want the peace that the\r\nworld is considering. Israel wants its own special kind\r\nof peace. It wants the international community to go\r\nalong with the current reality — the occupation of\r\nterritory, without giving the Palestinians any role or a\r\nState. This is why violence in the region is a dynamic\r\nof action and reaction. This is why there has been\r\nbloodshed and why life and property continue to be\r\ndestroyed. Will the world stand by and watch the\r\nkilling of innocents, the murder of the elderly and\r\nchildren?\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman therefore invites the two\r\nsponsors of the peace process — the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Russian Federation — and the\r\nSecretary-General to play their role so that the situation\r\ncan return to normal and so that the peace process, in\r\nall its aspects, can be revived and resumed from the\r\npoint where it left off.\r\nMy Government supports the just position of the\r\nfraternal Syrian Arab Republic. Its actions are aimed at\r\nrecovering the occupied territory of the Golan Heights\r\nand at ensuring Israel’s withdrawal to the 4 June 1967\r\nborder. In our opinion, it is in Israel’s interest to\r\nresume the negotiations, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of international law and international\r\nresolutions including Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973), as well as the principle of land\r\nfor peace, in order to lay the foundation for peace and\r\nsecurity, so that an effective partnership can be built\r\nand a lasting, stable and viable relationship based on\r\nmutual interests among the States of the region can be\r\nestablished and consolidated.\r\nMy Government also asks Israel to work towards\r\nthe full implementation of Security Council resolution\r\n425 (1978), which calls upon Israel to withdraw from\r\nall Lebanese territory. The Shab’a farms area is an\r\nintegral part of Lebanese territory and is covered by\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nthat resolution. It is in Israel’s interest to withdraw\r\nfrom that territory in order to broaden the prospects of\r\npeace and to strengthen peace and stability, which\r\neveryone desires.\r\nThe imposition of sanctions as a political\r\nmechanism means that Governments must fulfil their\r\nobligations under international resolutions. However,\r\nwe see that this policy has become a weapon that\r\njeopardizes the fundamental rights of peoples. This is\r\nunacceptable. Hence, it is important that the Security\r\nCouncil seek effective policies and mechanisms that\r\ntake into account the extent to which resolutions have\r\nbeen implemented by the countries to which those\r\nresolutions are addressed, such as Iraq, Libya and\r\nothers.\r\nDespite all the serious international and regional\r\nefforts to relieve the suffering of the fraternal Iraqi\r\npeople, we note that the overall situation in Iraq and\r\nthe future of the Iraqi people are becoming increasingly\r\nproblematic because of the economic embargo imposed\r\non them in 1990. That is also the view of the\r\nhumanitarian and international agencies and\r\norganizations in Iraq.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman supports all efforts to lift\r\ncompletely the economic sanctions against Iraq. At the\r\nsame time, we call upon the Iraqi Government to\r\ncooperate constructively with the United Nations in\r\norder to implement the remaining relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, particularly regarding prisoners of\r\nwar, missing Kuwaitis and missing persons from third\r\nStates.\r\nThe Sultanate of Oman warmly welcomes the\r\nwise approach of our brethren in Bahrain and Qatar.\r\nThose two countries have proceeded to implement the\r\nJudgment of the International Court of Justice of 16\r\nMarch 2001. That positive approach by those two\r\nfraternal countries has eliminated many sources of\r\ntension and has made a genuine contribution to the\r\nestablishment of peace, security and stability in the\r\nregion.\r\nMy Government is gratified by the friendly\r\nofficial contacts between the United Arab Emirates and\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, which will enable those\r\ntwo countries to agree on joint means to put an end to\r\ntheir dispute over the three islands belonging to the\r\nEmirates.\r\nThe political, economic, social and cultural\r\nchanges taking place in today’s world mean that\r\nAfrican countries and their leaders must work hard to\r\nbuild trust among their peoples and their countries so\r\nthat they can cooperate on the basis of common interest\r\nand constructive dialogue and so that they can take\r\nlocal measures and initiatives to resolve all their\r\ndisputes and to solve the refugee problem. We call on\r\nthe international community, as represented by the\r\nUnited Nations, to take equitable measures to improve\r\nthe situation in Africa and to make it possible to\r\nresolve its political, economic, social and health\r\nproblems.\r\nBecause of the great importance that the\r\nSultanate of Oman attaches to development, we are\r\npleased that the first International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development will take place in Mexico\r\nin 2002 and that this date is in the near future. We\r\nappreciate the value of dialogue between the rich\r\ncountries of the North and the countries of the South\r\nthat are bedevilled by social and environmental\r\nproblems, and we hope that contacts and dialogue\r\nbetween the two groups will increase genuine\r\ncooperation and coordination among States in all\r\nfields, with a view to narrowing the economic and\r\ntechnological gap between their peoples.\r\nOver the past 30 years of Oman’s development\r\nprocess, my Government has constantly worked to\r\nbalance development and environmental protection.\r\nSuch efforts have been successful thanks to His\r\nMajesty the Sultan’s declaration of 2001 as the Year of\r\nthe Environment. In the framework of our contribution\r\nand of our interest in global environmental issues, we\r\nhave pledged that we will sign all conventions and\r\ntreaties aimed at protecting the Earth’s environment.\r\nMy country today appeals to developed countries to\r\nmeet the commitments they undertook at the United\r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development,\r\nheld at Rio de Janeiro, especially with respect to the\r\nprovision of technical assistance to developing\r\ncountries.\r\nIn the light of the importance of integration into\r\nthe world economy, my country officially joined the\r\nWorld Trade Organization on 9 November 2000. We\r\nhope thus to enhance the role and the level of our trade\r\nand industrial organizations and services and to ensure\r\nthat they are duly integrated into world markets. My\r\ncountry has undertaken great economic reforms to\r\nliberalize trade and investment. We have also enacted\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nmany laws and have strengthened our mechanisms and\r\nregulations in these areas.\r\nI should mention that, on 20 December 2000 at\r\nNew York, the Sultanate of Oman signed the Rome\r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court. We hope to\r\ncomplete the ratification process and thus to accede to\r\nthis new organ of international law, which is aimed at\r\nbringing to justice those who violate human rights and\r\ncommit crimes against humanity, wherever they may\r\nbe.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his annual\r\nreport on the work of the Organization (A/56/1). It sets\r\nout the achievements of the United Nations while\r\ndescribing the obstacles in its way, and it charts a\r\ncourse for the future to strengthen our work towards\r\nthe purposes for which the United Nations was\r\nestablished. In his report, the Secretary-General also\r\ndiscusses the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and its ambitious recommendations. We\r\nmust be ready now to endorse visions that would\r\nstrengthen the United Nations and restructure it in line\r\nwith current realities. That includes enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council in a manner proportionate to the\r\noverall membership of the international community. In\r\nthat way the Organization can serve as an effective\r\nintermediary in international life and a source of\r\ninternational law.\r\nIt is our hope that this session will be successful,\r\nand that it will set out a vision of the future that will\r\ndefine the contours of future action for the benefit of\r\nall mankind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): A\r\nnumber of representatives have asked to speak in\r\nexercise of the right of reply. Before calling on those\r\nrepresentatives, I wish to recall that, in accordance\r\nwith decision 34/401, statements in right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I should like to\r\nspeak briefly in exercise of the right of reply to the\r\nremarks about the Chagos archipelago made today by\r\nthe Prime Minister of Mauritius. The British\r\nGovernment maintains that the British Indian Ocean\r\nTerritory is British and that it has been since 1814. It\r\ndoes not recognize the sovereignty claim of the\r\nGovernment of Mauritius.\r\nHowever, the British Government has recognized\r\nMauritius as the only State which has a right to assert a\r\nclaim of sovereignty when the United Kingdom\r\nrelinquishes its own sovereignty. Successive British\r\nGovernments have given undertakings to the\r\nGovernment of Mauritius that the Territory will be\r\nceded when it is no longer required for defence\r\npurposes, subject to the requirements of international\r\nlaw. The British Government remains open to\r\ndiscussions regarding arrangements governing the\r\nBritish Indian Ocean Territory or the future of the\r\nTerritory. The British Government has stated that,\r\nwhen the time comes for the Territory to be ceded, it\r\nwill engage in close liaison with the Government of\r\nMauritius.\r\nFinally, the British Government values its close\r\nand constructive cooperation with the Government of\r\nMauritius on a wide range of issues, and looks forward\r\nto that cooperation continuing.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My\r\ndelegation has asked to exercise its right of reply to\r\nclarify and correct some of the information in the\r\nstatement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nActing Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait. My\r\ndelegation would like to say the following.\r\nFirst, the Acting Prime Minister of the State of\r\nKuwait stated that his country was under constant\r\nthreats to its security and sovereignty. We would like to\r\nmake it clear to the General Assembly that since the\r\nceasefire, Iraq has made no threats against Kuwait. We\r\nwould like to remind the Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Kuwait that Iraq is under constant attack by\r\nAmerican and British planes, and these attacks have\r\nclaimed many victims, including innocent civilians.\r\nThis military aggression is launched from Kuwaiti\r\nland, waters and airspace. These daily attacks are\r\ndocumented by the United Nations. Therefore, Kuwait\r\nand the other aggressive States must shoulder their full\r\ninternational responsibilities. Iraq reserves its juridical\r\nright to ask for compensation as a result of its constant\r\nlosses, in accordance with international liability law.\r\nSecondly, as regards missing persons, everyone\r\nknows that Iraq has often stated that no Kuwaiti or\r\nnon-Kuwaiti prisoners of war can be found within its\r\nborders. In fact, Iraq freed all Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti\r\nprisoners of war as soon as the ceasefire was\r\nestablished under Security Council resolution 687\r\n(1991). This resolution also covered the freeing of Iraqi\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nprisoners of war, which was one of the ceasefire\r\nconditions. That is why Iraq had no interest in keeping\r\nany Kuwaiti or non-Kuwaiti prisoners of war.\r\nIraq asks Kuwait to no longer politicize the\r\nquestion of missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war. This\r\nmatter should be settled through bilateral negotiations\r\nor under the aegis of the Arab League. Through the\r\nAssembly, I would also like to appeal again to our\r\nKuwaiti brothers to establish direct bilateral\r\nnegotiations in order to solve this humanitarian\r\nproblem. I wish to remind Kuwait and the General\r\nAssembly that Iraq has provided over 1,042 files on\r\nmissing Iraqi civilian and military personnel to the\r\nintermediary of the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross. The Government of Kuwait, however, has\r\nprovided us with no information on the missing Iraqis.\r\nFor the same humanitarian reasons cited by the Acting\r\nPrime Minister of Kuwait, we would like to ask Kuwait\r\nto cooperate with us in providing necessary\r\ninformation on the fate of missing Iraqis.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I am\r\nvery sorry to have to ask to exercise my right of reply\r\nat this late hour, but I can see that the incorrect\r\ninformation presented by Iraq requires clarification and\r\nrectification.\r\nWe have heard that Iraq has never threatened\r\nKuwait since the ceasefire. This is obviously\r\nerroneous, as stated by Acting Prime Minister Sheikh\r\nEabah al-Ahmad. He stated that there had in fact been\r\nmany declarations threatening and undermining the\r\nsecurity and sovereignty of Kuwait, and this has been\r\nborne out by many of Iraq’s recent activities. Iraq has\r\nrefused to renew the commitment on the independence,\r\nsecurity and sovereignty of Kuwait, which led to the\r\nArab Summit’s lack of success. Kuwait has sent many\r\nletters to the Security Council alerting it to various\r\nstatements, including those by President Saddam\r\nHussein, and these letters have been published as\r\nofficial documents of the United Nations.\r\nIt seems to me that what Iraq has said concerning\r\nAmerican and British planes is a question of the no-\r\nflight zones. As for support for these flights, the zones\r\nwere set up to ensure Iraq’s commitment to abide by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 687 (1991). There is an\r\nagreement between Iraq and the coalition countries\r\nconcerning ceasefire arrangements. According to its\r\nterms, these planes are to fly over Iraq and do not need\r\nto be based in Kuwait or anywhere else. A number of\r\naircraft carriers off Kuwait are available to support\r\nsuch flights. Therefore, we reject such allegations and\r\nwould like to ask Iraq to abide by all its commitments\r\nto relevant Security Council resolutions. Only in this\r\nway can we achieve the general objective of ensuring\r\npeace and stability in this vital region.\r\nAs to prisoners of war and missing persons, we\r\nare very sorry to hear what Iraq has said on this\r\nsubject. It is by no means new; we have heard such\r\nerroneous information before. For over 10 years now,\r\nsince the liberation of Kuwait, Iraq has not complied\r\nwith the relevant resolutions on this subject, including\r\nresolutions 687 (1991) and 1284 (1999). A number of\r\npresidential press statements were made during the\r\nTripartite Commission meeting asking Iraq to settle\r\nthis question and to cooperate with Mr. Yuli Vorontsov,\r\nthe high-level Coordinator of the Secretary-General on\r\nthis matter. Unfortunately, Iraq has not yet responded\r\nto those statements. We hope that the Government of\r\nIraq will change its position on this matter and not\r\nsubject it to any political concessions.\r\nThe representative of Iraq has pointed out that\r\nKuwait has to settle this matter through bilateral\r\nnegotiations or through the League of Arab States. We\r\nhave in fact rejected that Iraqi proposal because it\r\nestablishes unnecessary mechanisms. There are already\r\ninternational mechanisms in existence, namely, the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and the\r\nTripartite Commission headed by the high-level\r\nCoordinator appointed by the Secretary-General in\r\naccordance with resolution 1284 (1999), Mr. Yuli\r\nVorontsov. The basic objective of the Iraqi proposal is\r\nto take this humanitarian issue outside the Security\r\nCouncil framework and to further delay a resolution of\r\nthis matter.\r\nWith regard to missing Iraqi persons, we wish to\r\nsay the following. If the Iraqi Government were indeed\r\nserious about discovering the fate of those missing\r\npersons, why does it not participate in the process set\r\nup by the Red Cross and the Tripartite Commission in\r\nthis regard? Kuwait had from the outset, for\r\nhumanitarian reasons, cooperated fully with the Red\r\nCross to solve this humanitarian issue, although it falls\r\noutside the purview of Security Council resolutions.\r\nKuwait had to submit to Iraqi occupation, and\r\nthis is just a way of diverting attention from that fact.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I wish\r\nto remind representatives that second statements in the\r\n40\r\nA/56/PV.47\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to five\r\nminutes.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I repeat\r\nonce again that Iraq has never threatened Kuwait. It is\r\nin the interest of Iraq to see stability and security\r\nprevail in the region. It is also in the interest of the\r\nArab countries.\r\nThe question of the no-flight zones has already\r\nbeen dealt with and resolved through several United\r\nNations resolutions and by the Secretary-General.\r\nStatements have been made to the effect that such\r\nzones are not based on any resolution of the Security\r\nCouncil, and are thus established in violation of\r\nCouncil resolutions and constitute an attack on Iraq.\r\nTherefore any facilities provided by Kuwait to the\r\naggressors’ planes are in violation of the Charter.\r\nKuwait is responsible for that under international law,\r\nas are the aggressor countries.\r\nMy Government reiterates its sincere invitation to\r\nKuwait to begin direct bilateral negotiations or\r\nnegotiations under the auspices of the Arab League to\r\ntake up the issue of missing Kuwaitis and Iraqis. Iraq is\r\nprepared to begin such negotiations immediately in\r\norder to resolve this matter on a humanitarian basis.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I am\r\nsorry for taking the floor once again. I shall be very\r\nbrief.\r\nI shall not repeat what has already been said with\r\nregard to the no-flight zones. But, with respect to Iraq’s\r\nappeal to Kuwait to resolve bilaterally the question of\r\nprisoners of war and missing persons, our position is\r\nwell known. In my first statement in exercise of the\r\nright of reply, I said that Kuwait refuses to create any\r\nnew mechanisms to deal with this humanitarian\r\nproblem. If Iraq were really serious and sincere, it\r\nwould cooperate with the International Committee of\r\nthe Red Cross and would participate in its meetings.\r\nWhy does Iraq not cooperate with the high-level\r\nCoordinator appointed by the Secretary-General for\r\nthat purpose? Why create new mechanisms? I have\r\nalready said that the reason Iraq has tried to take this\r\nissue outside the framework of United Nations\r\nresolutions is because it wants to weaken the issue and\r\ndelay the resolution of the matter. If Iraq really is\r\nsincere, why should we create a new international\r\nmechanism?\r\nFinally, I would like to reaffirm what the Acting\r\nPrime Minister of Kuwait said in his statement. All that\r\nwe ask of Iraq is for it to implement the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council. This has been\r\ncalled for not only in the United Nations, but also at\r\nmeetings of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and the Non-\r\nAligned Movement. The entire international\r\ncommunity is demanding that Iraq implement\r\ninternational resolutions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n"
