(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Rene R. Harris,\r\nPresident and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Nauru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Nauru.\r\nThe Honourable Rene R. Harris, President and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nNauru, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency The Honourable Rene R.\r\nHarris, President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Nauru, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Harris (Nauru): I bid the Assembly welcome\r\nfrom the people of Nauru, the pleasant little island of\r\nthe Pacific. Let me avail myself of the opportunity to\r\nextend to you, Sir, my Government’s belated\r\ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency\r\nof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMuch of the work of the United Nations since the\r\ndespicable attacks on the United States of America on\r\n11 September has been focused on counter-terrorism,\r\nand this is understandable. The Security Council’s\r\nadoption of resolution 1373 (2001), obligating\r\nMembers to implement anti-terrorist measures, should\r\nrecognize the importance of supporting existing\r\nregional initiatives in the fight against terrorism. To\r\nthis end, we welcome the undertakings by the Security\r\nCouncil Committee on Counter-Terrorism.\r\nThe World Bank has predicted that the events of\r\n11 September will exacerbate the already gloomy\r\nglobal economic outlook. Its ripples will be felt across\r\nall of the world’s regions, particularly in countries\r\ndependent on tourism, remittances and foreign\r\ninvestment. It is thus critical that the Security Council\r\nallow the competent bodies of the United Nations to\r\nassess the costs of extending, expanding or adding new\r\npeacekeeping operations before their implementation.\r\nNauru joins the international community in\r\noffering our belated but heartfelt congratulations to\r\nMr. Kofi Annan and the Organization on being the joint\r\nrecipients of this year’s prestigious Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThe former President of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, has to be commended for\r\ncapitalizing on the momentum generated by the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to endorse your\r\nproposed agenda, Mr. President, for the fifty-sixth\r\nsession. The work of the General Assembly should be\r\nrelevant to the tasks at hand, but at the same time it\r\nshould address long-standing issues affecting the\r\nefficiency and status of this body. Meaningful\r\ncooperation between Member States must always be\r\nencouraged across the boundaries of religion, ethnicity\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nand culture. The recent World Conference against\r\nRacism is a stark reminder of how the work of the\r\nUnited Nations will otherwise continue to be\r\nfrustrated; but the one significant area where the\r\nUnited Nations has made little or no progress is on the\r\nquestion of the reform of the Security Council. We\r\nwould therefore support a proposal to move the process\r\nto a higher level and to deal with the complex issues in\r\na step-by-step fashion.\r\nThe last meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nleaders was held in my country a few months ago. The\r\ncommuniqué of that meeting has been circulated as a\r\ndocument of the United Nations. In that communiqué\r\nthe Forum leaders sought to formalize cooperation\r\narrangements between the United Nations and the\r\nPacific Islands Forum. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to kindly request your support of the\r\nrelevant draft resolution.\r\nThe issues of climate change and sea-level rise\r\ncontinue to be of major concern to my country, and we\r\nhave repeatedly voiced our deep concern about the\r\nadverse impact of human-induced climate change,\r\nespecially on the low-lying atolls around the Pacific.\r\nWe have stressed the importance of efforts to build\r\nappropriate human and institutional capacity.\r\nThe Kyoto Protocol represents a significant step\r\nforward on the path to taking action to combat climate\r\nchange, but unless significant action is taken on a\r\npractical compliance regime, there is little prospect of\r\nany outcome being enforceable.\r\nNauru therefore looks forward to participating\r\nwith the rest of the world in Johannesburg next year to\r\nreview the progress made since Rio, and it is our\r\nfervent hope that the Kyoto Protocol will have come\r\ninto force by then.\r\nThere is a special urgency for Nauru. Economic\r\ngrowth in our small country has been negative for more\r\nthan a decade, and, as reflected in recent revisions of\r\nour classification by the United Nations and the United\r\nNations Development Programme, our per capita\r\nincome has fallen by almost 80 per cent since the\r\n1980s. We look to the international community, the\r\nUnited Nations and its various agencies to assist us\r\nthrough these difficult times and to help secure a safe\r\nfuture for our children.\r\nOur region, the world’s very first nuclear-free\r\nzone, has a long history of supporting disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons, born of the\r\nregion’s harsh experience with nuclear testing by\r\ncolonial Powers. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders\r\nhave again expressed their desire for the entry into\r\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nNauru will be depositing its instrument of ratification\r\ntoday, and I call on other States to follow suit.\r\nThe trans-shipment of radioactive material and\r\nMOX fuel, through our exclusive economic zones is a\r\ncontinuing concern, but we are committed to pursuing\r\nour concerns constructively and vigorously at the\r\nappropriate political level.\r\nNauru’s commitment to the international effort to\r\ncombat money-laundering is unwavering. Our\r\nParliament passed anti-money-laundering legislation in\r\nAugust of this year to correct the deficiencies in our\r\nregulatory and administrative arrangements. However,\r\nNauru is disappointed not to have graduated from the\r\nlist of special non-cooperating countries despite the\r\nfact that the legislation was drafted in close\r\ncollaboration with Financial Action Task Force on\r\nMoney Laundering (FATF) regional representatives.\r\nWe will nonetheless continue to work on satisfying the\r\nkey players in FATF on this issue, and we look forward\r\nto working with our regional partners under the Pacific\r\nregional action plan being developed.\r\nNauru, along with 20 other Member States, again\r\nsupported the inclusion of a resolution on the\r\nadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan on the\r\nagenda of the fifty-sixth session. While the attempt\r\nfailed, Nauru will not be discouraged from continuing\r\nits efforts to correct this anomaly. We on Nauru\r\nwholeheartedly believe that the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan has a part to play in this Organization, and its\r\npeople should not be denied a voice in this world body.\r\nWe note with pleasure the recent admission of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade\r\nOrganization.\r\nFinally, I wish to end my statement by revisiting\r\nthe issue of security and terrorism. It is indeed sad that\r\nas we meet here today, there is a war going on in the\r\nworld - a war against terrorism. Prior to the horrific 11\r\nSeptember attacks on the United States of America, my\r\nGovernment, at the request of the Government of\r\nAustralia, agreed to the use of Nauru as a refugee-\r\nprocessing centre. We made this decision on\r\nhumanitarian grounds. As a consequence, we now have\r\non Nauru nearly 800 asylum seekers from Afghanistan,\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nIraq and Palestine — 10 per cent of the whole\r\npopulation of Nauru — along with migration personnel\r\nfrom the United Nations, the International Organization\r\nfor Migration and Australia. The asylum seekers are\r\nnow being processed.\r\nI have taken it upon myself to personally visit the\r\ncamps from time to time and to mingle with these\r\nunfortunate people, and on several occasions have sat\r\ndown and broken bread with them. I found that they are\r\nlike you and me. They are brave human beings seeking\r\na better life for themselves and their children and\r\nescape from the oppression back home.\r\nThe resources of the United Nations need to be\r\naugmented to cope with this humanitarian tragedy, and\r\nthe international community needs to urgently tackle\r\nthe problem in a coordinated manner, not only in terms\r\nof providing assistance and refuge where possible,\r\nbut also in terms of addressing the sources and causes\r\nof refugees, people- smuggling and terrorism.\r\nUnderstanding and responding will not necessarily\r\nsolve the problem, but it will make it easier for\r\nGovernments to share in the continuing international\r\neffort that will be needed.\r\nFinally, may I say that the good old days, before\r\n11 September, are gone forever, and I shed a tear. The\r\nsad part is that we inherited a world that was good\r\nfrom our forefathers. Today, I ask, do we leave\r\ntomorrow a better world for our children and our\r\nchildren’s children? That I ask. Mr. President, we look\r\nto you for leadership on these vital issues.\r\nThank you. May God bless those in sorrow. May\r\nGod bless the United States of America. And may God\r\nbless the United Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Nauru for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rene R. Harris, President and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Nauru, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, President\r\nand Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the\r\nRepublic of Kenya\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President and Commander in Chief of\r\nthe Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nThe Honourable Daniel Toroitich arap Moi,\r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nRepublic of Kenya, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency the Honourable Daniel\r\nToroitich arap Moi, President and Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kenya, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident arap Moi (Kenya): I congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your unanimous election as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. I would also like to extend my sincere\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his re-election to a second term in office\r\nand for the richly deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded\r\nto him and the United Nations Organization. This is an\r\nacknowledgement of his tireless efforts in the service\r\nof mankind and, as the Secretary-General has said, of a\r\nchallenge to do better and, I hope, faster. I would like\r\nto assure the Secretary-General of my Government’s\r\ncooperation and firm commitment in that regard.\r\nThe achievements of the United Nations\r\nOrganization are many and varied, while its increasing\r\nrelevance in an ever more complex international\r\nenvironment is clear to us. Its objectives are still as\r\nvalid and noble today as they were 56 years ago and, I\r\nbelieve, can only be achieved by our continued\r\ncommitment, careful vigilance and firm action.\r\nI would now like to turn my attention to an issue\r\nthat is uppermost in my mind and that has changed the\r\nway we live and do business, maybe forever. I am\r\nreferring to the terrorist attacks on the United States of\r\nAmerica, an important, worthy and respected Member\r\nof the United Nations Organization and a long-standing\r\nand trusted friend of Kenya.\r\nTerrorism poses a real threat to international\r\npeace and security and must be condemned by people\r\nof good will throughout the world. Terrorism cannot be\r\njustified in any form whatsoever. No philosophy,\r\nreligion or creed can allow the taking away of innocent\r\nlives and the destruction of valuable property. The\r\npeople of Kenya experienced first-hand the devastating\r\neffects of terrorism in August 1998. The attack on\r\nKenya, a country faced with challenges of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment, was especially severe and continues\r\nto affect us. Kenya understands well the pain of those\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\naffected by the recent attacks in the United States of\r\nAmerica and fully supports the efforts being led by the\r\nPresident of the United States of America, Mr. George\r\nW. Bush, and his administration to fight terrorism in all\r\nits forms.\r\nIn order to carry out one of its fundamental\r\nobjectives, that of the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, the United Nations, and in\r\nparticular its membership, must intensify efforts to\r\nresolve all outstanding and persistent conflicts raging\r\nin many parts of the world. We the Member States of\r\nthe United Nations must work very closely to ensure\r\nthat we completely disable the terrorist machinery. We\r\nmust particularly support the coalition against\r\nterrorism.\r\nAs an Organization, we must address the issue of\r\nconflicts seriously. Conflict situations impede\r\ndevelopment, provide an atmosphere for the illegal\r\nexploitation of resources, the abuse of children, the\r\ninflux of refugees, the spread of dangerous weapons\r\nand the deepening of poverty, to mention just a few\r\naspects. Conflicts steal the dreams, hopes, aspirations\r\nand opportunities of many, many people, especially\r\nchildren. We must intensify our efforts in the search for\r\nthe peaceful and speedy resolution of conflicts.\r\nThe conflicts in Africa continue to destabilize our\r\ncontinent. The United Nations and its membership\r\nmust intensify efforts to find solutions to the conflicts.\r\nThe peaceful resolution of conflicts is a\r\nfundamental tenet of Kenya’s foreign policy. It is a\r\nmatter of record that I have spared no effort throughout\r\nmy political career in search of peaceful solutions to\r\nconflicts in our region and elsewhere. Currently, Kenya\r\nis involved in peace negotiations in southern Sudan,\r\nSomalia, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. We would like more international involvement\r\nin peace efforts in Africa.\r\nThe biggest challenge facing the African\r\ncontinent today is the increasing level of poverty.\r\nPoverty has become an obstacle, a roadblock to every\r\neffort we are making at improving the overall welfare\r\nof our people.\r\nPoverty is a fertile breeding ground for conflict\r\nand instability, and even terrorism. It is therefore\r\nregrettable that very little progress, if any, has been\r\nmade since the World Summit for Social Development,\r\nheld in Copenhagen in 1995. I remind members that the\r\nmain outcome of that Summit was the resolve to\r\neradicate poverty as an obstacle to human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe cannot succeed in improving the lives of our\r\npeople without the wholehearted engagement of the\r\ninternational community. The global target of reducing\r\npoverty by half by the year 2015 cannot be achieved\r\nwithout tangible availability of resources.\r\nOur efforts at attacking poverty are further\r\nundermined by the scourge of HIV/AIDS and other\r\ntreatable diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which\r\nhave the potential of reversing all the socio-economic\r\ngains we have worked so hard to achieve.\r\nI applaud the Secretary-General for organizing a\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS earlier this year. The\r\nestablishment of the Global AIDS Fund is a very\r\nwelcome development. I look forward to its\r\ncontribution and active participation in our daily\r\nstruggle against HIV/AIDS. Kenya calls on the\r\ninternational community to lend its full support to the\r\nfund.\r\nThe effect of marginalization on developing\r\ncountries posed by the accelerated process of\r\nglobalization must be addressed as a matter of priority.\r\nIt is my hope that the Fourth World Trade Organization\r\nMinisterial Conference in Doha, Qatar, will address the\r\nissue of the imbalance in international trade more\r\neffectively. The issue of meaningful market access,\r\nparticularly for agricultural products, must be resolved\r\nquickly. Protectionist policies are in no country\u0027s\r\ninterest and definitely contradict the principles of free\r\ntrade and the process of liberalization. In addition,\r\nresources must be made available to the World Trade\r\nOrganization by our partners to enable it to provide\r\ntechnical assistance and capacity-building to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nSolutions in the form of better terms of trade and\r\nmarket access must go hand-in-hand with the flow of\r\nforeign direct investment to developing countries.\r\nMany African countries have taken bold initiatives to\r\nprovide a conducive environment for investors. These\r\nefforts need to be supported by clear policies of\r\ndeveloped countries to encourage private sector\r\ninvestment in Africa.\r\nWe urgently need to be freed from the burdens\r\nthat are diverting vital resources from our economic\r\ndevelopment. Debt relief is necessary. It is in our\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\ncommon interest that our economies be restored to\r\nhealth in a meaningful time frame.\r\nMy concluding remarks relate to the desire for\r\nequity, fair play and justice for all. This is one of the\r\ncardinal objectives of the United Nations. I welcome\r\nthe efforts that the Organization has made in the pursuit\r\nof these objectives.\r\nWe welcome these efforts. Yet it is a matter of\r\nconcern that commitments in the programmes of action\r\nagreed upon have not been fully complied with. This\r\nsituation must be reversed. My challenge to the\r\nOrganization is that these commitments be honoured so\r\nthat humanity can feel that the United Nations is truly\r\nan organization of hope for many nations and peoples\r\nthroughout the world. We cannot continue doing what\r\nhas so far failed. We need to work on new ways of\r\naddressing our common problems. My Government\r\nstands ready to do its part, and I challenge other\r\nGovernments to do theirs. Together we shall succeed in\r\nmeeting our commitments to have poverty reduced by\r\nhalf by 2015.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the\r\nRepublic of Kenya for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Daniel Toroitich arap Moi, MP,\r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed\r\nForces of the Republic of Kenya, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I should to draw the attention of\r\nmembers to the fact that a number of statements made\r\nin the general debate have gone beyond the 15-minute\r\ntime limit. This has disrupted the schedule of\r\nstatements by other speakers as well as the schedule of\r\nbilateral consultations. In that connection, and with\r\nconsideration for other delegations, I should like once\r\nagain to appeal earnestly to Member States to limit\r\ntheir statements to 15 minutes so that all speakers on\r\nthe list for each meeting during the remaining five days\r\nof the general debate can be accommodated at the\r\nprojected time and so that bilateral consultations and\r\nother planned activities can proceed as scheduled. I\r\nthank members for their understanding and for their\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Borg (Malta): Allow me to begin by\r\nexpressing my congratulations to you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly. The\r\nfifty-sixth session is clearly going to be a challenging\r\none, and one that I predict will further strengthen the\r\nresolve of members to work hand in hand on all the\r\ndifferent issues requiring our attention. I would like\r\nalso to convey my appreciation to His Excellency Mr.\r\nHarri Holkeri for the determined and skilful manner in\r\nwhich he presided over the previous session.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the United Nations and its tireless\r\nSecretary-General on the Nobel Peace Prize that they\r\nhave jointly and so deservedly been awarded.\r\nThis session started in a markedly different\r\nmanner from those of previous years. The horrendous\r\n11 September terrorist attacks brought home the very\r\nreal threat of terrorism to each and every one of us no\r\nmatter what corner of the world we inhabit.\r\nInternational terrorism does not limit its actions to\r\nindividual countries. In fact, although the attacks were\r\nlaunched on United States soil, the specific targets\r\nchosen clearly show the intent to destroy symbols of\r\nthe modern world, icons to free people everywhere.\r\nIndeed, by attacking this cosmopolitan city and\r\nits World Trade Center, the perpetrators targeted us all.\r\nNationals of more than 60 countries met their death in\r\nthose dastardly attacks. Even if our own nationals were\r\nnot among those who lost their lives, we all felt under\r\nattack. We all felt violated. In one way or another, our\r\nlives have been altered forever, and we must respond\r\naccordingly.\r\nWe must fight the scourge of terrorism with\r\nunreserved and unhesitating resolve. We must do this\r\nnot merely as a means to defend all that we hold dear.\r\nWe must do it to secure a safer world for ourselves, for\r\nthose who will follow us and for those who have had\r\ntheir lives irrevocably transformed as a result of these\r\nterrorist attacks. That resolve must be our tribute to the\r\ninnocent and the brave who lost their lives in the l1\r\nSeptember attacks.\r\nThe two-month postponement of the general\r\ndebate has provided us with time to reflect and to act.\r\nMalta has joined the international community’s\r\nabsolute and unreserved condemnation of the terrorist\r\nacts. We have also stepped up our action in pursuit of\r\nthe effective implementation of anti-terrorism\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nmeasures, including comprehensive compliance with\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nMalta was among the first six countries to sign\r\nthe International Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, and yesterday became one of\r\nthe first States to ratify it. On Sunday, Malta also\r\nacceded to the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected\r\nPersons, including Diplomatic Agents; to the\r\nInternational Convention against the Taking of\r\nHostages; and to the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings.\r\nThe new realities of today’s world have certainly\r\nbrought to the fore the importance of those conventions\r\non terrorism. At the same time, they have also brought\r\ninto bold relief the wisdom that underpins the efforts of\r\nthe international community in its pursuit of the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court. My\r\nGovernment is politically committed to the Court and\r\nwill seek ratification of the Rome Statute by the\r\nMaltese parliament in the near future. We feel that, in\r\nthat way, we are doing all we can to ensure that no\r\nstone is left unturned in our fight against terrorism.\r\nWith each passing day, we witness the domino\r\neffect that acts of terror may have at a national,\r\nregional and global level. The impact this has on the\r\nlives of millions must be addressed. We feel therefore\r\nthat the time is ripe to conclude the debate on an\r\noperational definition of the perpetration of a terrorist\r\nact. Intensified efforts aimed at the expeditious\r\nconclusion of negotiations on the Indian proposal\r\nshould subsequently yield a comprehensive convention\r\non international terrorism, which will be of benefit to\r\nus all. We firmly believe that such an umbrella\r\nagreement will give added value to, and further\r\ncomplement, other existing conventions on terrorism.\r\nWe also believe that the General Assembly should\r\nactively consider convening a high-level conference on\r\nterrorism under United Nations auspices upon or\r\nimmediately after the conclusion of such a convention.\r\nThat would serve to reinforce ongoing international\r\nefforts to formulate a collective response to terrorism.\r\nThe unity of purpose currently prevailing within\r\nthe international community in its fight against\r\nterrorism is perhaps unprecedented. Indeed, the\r\npolitical will displayed over the past two months is a\r\nclear manifestation, if any were needed, that\r\nmultilateralism remains a vital tool in the conduct of\r\nrelations among States at a global level. That political\r\nwill has also been seen in the other work of the\r\nOrganization. Allow me therefore to turn to other\r\nissues on the agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nI would like first to express my Government’s full\r\nsupport for the initiative of the German and French\r\nGovernments to bring the issue of human cloning\r\nbefore the United Nations. Aimed at drafting a\r\nconvention banning human cloning for the purposes of\r\nreproduction, that initiative has received wide support\r\nfrom all quarters. The concern expressed underlines the\r\nfundamental nature of the threat to humanity posed by\r\nscientists who are unwilling to accept ethical and moral\r\nlimits on their work. In responding to the Franco-\r\nGerman initiative, the United Nations will ensure that a\r\nstrong and meaningful convention can be drafted and\r\nadopted within as short a time frame as possible.\r\nThe United Nations has already had occasion to\r\nexhibit its ability to act swiftly and decisively when the\r\nconscience of the international community is\r\nheightened. The entry into force of the Ottawa\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction, which Malta ratified earlier this\r\nyear, was made possible by the international\r\ncommunity’s outrage at the devastating impact of those\r\nindiscriminate weapons, whose horrific effects long\r\noutlast their military purpose.\r\nSimilarly, the seriousness and urgency of the\r\nproblem of human cloning should expedite the\r\nconclusion of an internationally binding agreement on\r\nthat issue. I have no doubt that the richly diverse\r\nbeliefs reflected in this room are united in their respect\r\nfor human dignity and identity, and their concern with\r\nthe fundamental and far-reaching implications of\r\nhuman cloning.\r\nOther world events continue to pose a threat to\r\nthe fundamental right of peoples to live in a secure,\r\nstable and prosperous environment. The current state of\r\naffairs in the Middle East is an example. The dramatic\r\ncontrast between the optimism apparent at the\r\nMillennium Assembly’s opening and the escalation in\r\nviolence over the past few months has made it\r\nincreasingly difficult for the parties to return to the\r\npositions they were in just over 12 months ago.\r\nMalta is convinced that the Mitchell report and\r\nthe Tenet Plan provide a realistic and readily\r\nachievable way out of the spiral of violence that has\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nengulfed the region. The peace, security and welfare of\r\nall the people concerned require that their full\r\nimplementation be urgently embarked upon. This\r\nnecessitates the re-establishment of security\r\ncooperation between the parties in the interests of both\r\nIsraelis and Palestinians; the stationing of international\r\nobservers, preferably from several regions; and an end\r\nto all new settlement activity, including so-called\r\n“natural growth”. Against this backdrop, Malta hopes\r\nthat both parties will be able to return to the\r\nnegotiating table with the aim of achieving a just and\r\npermanent peace in the region on the basis of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nAlso in the Mediterranean, the situation in Cyprus\r\nhas remained a cause of concern for over 25 years. We\r\nearnestly hope that an early settlement of the Cyprus\r\nquestion will be found. In this connection, we reaffirm\r\nour full support for efforts to find a solution on the\r\nbasis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nProgress towards lasting peace and stability in the\r\nMediterranean often appears to unfold very slowly.\r\nEvents in the Balkans since we met here last year,\r\nhowever, bring fresh hope to us all. The end of the\r\nMilosevic era was a clear example of the positive\r\nchange that can be wrought through the power of the\r\npeople, signalling a fresh beginning for the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and indeed for all the\r\nneighbouring independent republics.\r\nIn recent months, turmoil and unrest have also\r\nthreatened to engulf the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia. Yet the unfolding situation now reveals\r\nencouraging signs of the power of diplomacy.\r\nInternational assistance extended to republics in the\r\nBalkan region is also indicative of the power within\r\neach of us to make our own contribution and to play a\r\npart.\r\nMalta feels this onus most strongly and actively\r\nseeks to play a role on the international stage that goes\r\nbeyond the mere limitations of its geographical size. In\r\nfact, in keeping with this consciousness, Malta is\r\nproceeding steadily towards its objective of acceding to\r\nthe European Union — a union of like-minded States\r\nwhere we naturally belong, not only politically, but\r\nalso economically, culturally and historically. Our\r\nintention is therefore to become an integral part of the\r\nEuropean Union at its next enlargement, enabling us to\r\nparticipate fully in a decision-making process that all\r\ntoo often carries wide-ranging implications for our\r\ncountry.\r\nLike other candidate countries, Malta is currently\r\nnegotiating the terms of entry into the European Union\r\nin what will be an unprecedented widening and\r\ndeepening of the Union. Already more than halfway\r\nthrough this process, we are working hard to ensure\r\nthat Malta is not only well equipped to deal with the\r\nchallenges of membership but is also in a position to\r\nmake a significant contribution to the Union. This\r\nhistoric project and the enhancement of Mediterranean\r\ncooperation are both of immediate concern to Malta.\r\nWe feel that they go hand in hand.\r\nAn increase in dialogue between all nations and a\r\nmove towards securing a safer planet are in everyone’s\r\ninterest. However, threats to international security, not\r\nleast those posed by weapons of mass destruction,\r\ncontinue to lurk in the background. In July this year,\r\nMalta deposited its instrument of ratification of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Malta hopes\r\nthat the remaining 13 countries whose ratification is\r\nnecessary for the Treaty to come into force will join the\r\n84 countries that have already done this. Thus a\r\nsignificant collective step will have been taken towards\r\nreducing the risk of nuclear disaster.\r\nNot so long ago, the terms “environment” and\r\n“international security” in the same sentence would\r\nhave drawn a perplexed response from most audiences.\r\nToday, the link between the two is becoming\r\nincreasingly apparent. The urgency in addressing the\r\ngreatest threats to our natural environment was made\r\namply clear in Bonn during the sixth session of the\r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. Despite\r\nbeing faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles,\r\nthe international community succeeded in forging the\r\nEarth’s first major action-oriented response to the\r\nphenomenon of global warming.\r\nIn this respect, allow me to offer my\r\nGovernment’s expression of gratitude to the Chairman\r\nof the Conference, Mr. Jan Pronk, as well as to my\r\ncompatriot Mr. Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive\r\nSecretary of the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, for their enormous\r\npersonal efforts to secure a successful outcome. Their\r\nsuccess laid the groundwork for the breakthrough\r\nachieved at the seventh session of the Conference in\r\nMarrakech last week. The agreement on the modalities\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nof implementation of the Kyoto Protocol has opened\r\nthe door to its ratification by all States signatories.\r\nIndeed, Malta deposited its instrument of ratification\r\nyesterday and looks forward to the present momentum\r\nbeing sustained, leading to an early entry into force of\r\nthis landmark Protocol.\r\nDifficult and complex as it may be to tackle\r\nenvironmental global problems, the most challenging\r\nenvironmental problems are often those in our own\r\nbackyards. With one of the highest population densities\r\nin the world, Malta has achieved a high level of human\r\ndevelopment without any natural resources at its\r\ndisposal. In seeking to continue to raise our living\r\nstandards, we grapple daily with difficult decisions\r\naimed at ensuring that economic development on our\r\nislands is environmentally sustainable.\r\nThere is no simple trade-off between the\r\nprotection of the environment and the production of\r\nwealth. The Mediterranean Sea, which provides Malta\r\nwith its economic lifeline, is perhaps the most tangible\r\nproof of the fact that economic progress at the expense\r\nof the environment is no progress at all. In reaping its\r\nbountiful fruits, we know that they are not unlimited\r\nand, if not tended to, will dry up altogether. The same\r\napplies to other seas and oceans.\r\nWith this in mind, Malta yesterday became the\r\nthirtieth State to accede to the Agreement for the\r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea relating to the\r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish\r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks — a move\r\nthat will bring the Agreement itself into force on 11\r\nDecember 2001. For Malta, having initiated the process\r\nthat led to the United Nations Convention on the Law\r\nof the Sea, it is a source of great satisfaction to\r\ncontribute to the further development of this veritable\r\npillar of international law.\r\nWhile there is inevitably still more that can be\r\ndone, both at a domestic and an international level, I\r\nhope that this General Assembly session will serve as a\r\nrenewed impetus for us all to promote everything\r\nnecessary to make the world safer and more secure.\r\nThis is our fundamental duty, as political leaders, for\r\nthe welfare of present and future generations. We must\r\ncontinue to foster social justice, promote equitable\r\ndevelopment, nurture confidence among peoples, settle\r\nconflicts and take the appropriate measures to ensure\r\nsecurity for all. Yet in doing all this, Governments and\r\npeoples must ensure that we continue first and\r\nforemost to build peace in the minds of men and\r\nwomen. That undertaking, adopted by the generation\r\nthat survived the Second World War, retains its noble\r\nauthenticity today as we face the challenges of our own\r\ntimes.\r\nMr. Cem (Turkey): This meeting is being held at\r\na most difficult hour. The terrorist attacks carried out in\r\nNew York and Washington, D.C., cast a long shadow\r\nover this session of the General Assembly. But we must\r\nstand united, drawing the right conclusions from this\r\ncatastrophe. The date of 11 September has made it\r\nclear that terrorism is now humankind’s number-one\r\nenemy, and that it must be addressed with the utmost\r\nseriousness and determination.\r\nWe share the American nation’s grief. We\r\nreiterate our full support to the United States\r\nAdministration in its efforts to track down those\r\nresponsible and to bring them to justice. As a country\r\nthat has lost so many of its citizens to terrorism,\r\nTurkey deeply feels the grief of this tragic event.\r\nTo combat terrorism efficiently and to develop a\r\nstrong coalition of United Nations Members against\r\nterrorism, certain principles should guide our collective\r\neffort. First, terrorism does not have a religion or a\r\ngeography, and there can be no justification for\r\nterrorist acts under any circumstances. Secondly, the\r\nuse of double standards is the main obstacle to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. Thirdly, we have to be conscious of\r\nthe fact that terrorism is a global phenomenon.\r\nNo ideal, no cause and no end can justify\r\nterrorism. We should avoid spurious justifications for\r\ndeliberate killing. To identify terrorism with any\r\nreligion is a sacrilege against all religions. We strongly\r\ncondemn those who couple the name of a religion with\r\na definition of terrorism or terrorists. To fight this\r\ndangerous trend, we fully support all initiatives aimed\r\nat dispelling these erroneous approaches.\r\nWe commend the ongoing mutual efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as several other initiatives. In\r\nthis context, Turkey has proposed an informal forum\r\nbetween members of, and aspirants to, the European\r\nUnion and the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\n(OIC) to discuss, from a political perspective, issues\r\npertaining to harmony among civilizations. We have\r\nthe initial support of the relevant organizations and of\r\nseveral countries. We hope to hold this conference by\r\nFebruary 2002.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nTerrorism does not have a geography. The same\r\nterrorism manifests itself in different countries all over\r\nthe world, both in the West and in the East. To be\r\nserious and effective, the anti-terrorist struggle has to\r\nbe all-encompassing and deal with all terrorist centres,\r\nactivities and logistics. It should address all countries\r\nthat harbour and tolerate terrorism or that are\r\nindifferent to terrorist groups that incite or actively\r\nplan, finance or command terrorist operations executed\r\nin another country.\r\nBeing drawn into the trap of double standards in\r\ndefining or in dealing with terrorism inherently\r\nprovides support for terrorism. Unfortunately, we have\r\nbeen witnessing several cases of double standards. I\r\nwill try to give some views on this particular subject.\r\nThere is an unfortunate de facto distinction made\r\nin the conceptual approaches of several countries\r\nbetween “bad” terrorists, who work against a particular\r\ncountry, and tolerated terrorists, who, while enjoying\r\nsafe haven in the same country, incite, plan, finance\r\nand sometimes command terrorist acts in another. My\r\ncountry, as well as several others, has been victim of\r\nthis double-standard approach. Groups implanted in\r\nforeign countries openly advocate the use of terrorist\r\nmeans under all sorts of pretexts. Their activities and\r\nmessages — which call for violence, and sometimes\r\nfor assassination — are freely propagated and are\r\nsometimes transmitted through the authorized media in\r\ntheir host countries. In short, acts and calls that would\r\ndraw an immediate reaction if they were the acts and\r\ncalls of indigenous terrorists targeting their own\r\ncountry are ignored and tolerated when they emanate\r\nfrom guest terrorists targeting their country of origin.\r\nThis unfortunate distinction between terrorists that hurt\r\nothers but not us and the prevailing double standards\r\nhave to be overcome if we are serious about fighting\r\nterrorists.\r\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon that crosses\r\nborders, and the fight against it requires effective\r\ninternational cooperation. Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) in particular provides a clear road map\r\nregarding the steps to be taken. We hope that all\r\nMember States will fully comply with this\r\ngroundbreaking resolution. The establishment of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to monitor\r\nimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001) is a major\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe welcome the joint declarations of 14 and 21\r\nSeptember 2001 by the European Union. Turkey\r\naligned itself with both, and we expect their prompt\r\nand resolute implementation. The European Union is in\r\nthe process of identifying terrorist organizations and\r\ntheir support networks. The list of terrorist\r\norganizations to be drawn up by the European Union\r\nmust not be restricted only to the geographical area of\r\nits members. It should definitely include those groups\r\nthat finance, plan and command terrorist activities in\r\nother countries.\r\nThere is a drastic need for vigilance and further\r\ncooperation between the relevant authorities, namely,\r\nthe justice and interior ministries of all countries. A\r\ndrastic change in attitude is imperative.\r\nIn order for it to be credible and effective, the\r\nanti-terror struggle has to be comprehensive and deal\r\nwith all terrorist centres. It is also incumbent upon all\r\nUnited Nations Member States to adopt the existing\r\ninternational legislation and to review national laws\r\naccordingly. International efforts to combat terrorism\r\ncannot be fully effective in the absence of a global\r\nconvention in this field.\r\nThe draft comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism now under discussion in the\r\nworking group established by the Sixth Committee\r\nseems to be our best chance to address this\r\nshortcoming. Although all participants have displayed\r\nremarkable flexibility, the working group has failed to\r\nresolve two central and interrelated issues: the\r\ndefinition of a terrorist offence and exclusions from the\r\nscope of the convention. I wish to take this opportunity\r\nto call upon all States to make an additional effort\r\ntowards finalizing the convention.\r\nIn combating terrorism, we cannot ignore the fact\r\nthat this scourge feeds on deteriorating social,\r\neconomic and political conditions. Illiteracy,\r\ndestitution, bigotry, racism, social and political\r\ninjustice and similar sources of grievance all play a\r\nrole in creating fertile ground for terrorism. The gap\r\nbetween the richest and the least fortunate nations of\r\nthe world keeps widening at an alarming pace. Threats\r\nsuch as illegal mass migration, corruption, drugs and\r\narms smuggling, money laundering and other types of\r\norganized crime are on the increase.\r\nIt is our collective responsibility to find lasting,\r\nviable solutions to these problems. Developing nations\r\nmust focus on ways of achieving sustainable economic\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\ngrowth, on improving income distribution, education\r\nand justice and on addressing other social needs.\r\nDeveloped nations must be more forthcoming in debt\r\nrelief, must increase development and humanitarian aid\r\nand must allow greater access to their markets.\r\nToday, the United Nations and its Member States\r\nface a mutual challenge. The name of this challenge is\r\nAfghanistan, and it has two dimensions: to combat the\r\nterrorist network, which, by exploiting the Afghan\r\npeople’s plight, has taken root in its geography; and to\r\nsupport the revival of Afghanistan, of the Afghan\r\nidentity, by ensuring peace, stability and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTurkey is resolutely committed to meet this\r\nchallenge; we fully support the United Nations efforts\r\nand those of the Special Representative, Mr. Brahimi.\r\nTurkey worked together with the Afghan people from\r\nthe 1920s to the 1960s; and it resumed cooperation\r\nagain in the early 1990s. We believe that concerted\r\ninternational action, with sound principles and\r\neffective means, is of crucial importance. I will try to\r\nelaborate on some suggestions.\r\nFirst, it is the Afghan people themselves who will\r\nrebuild their identity and their country. Our task is to\r\nassist and support their efforts — not to dictate who\r\nwill run their country, and how. In this respect, regional\r\nand tribal affinities should be encouraged to merge into\r\na single Afghan identity and assume a secondary role\r\nas sub-cultures. This is capital for Afghanistan.\r\nSecondly, all countries, either neighbours of or\r\ninvolved in Afghanistan, should be discouraged from\r\nrelying on particular Afghan groups as their primary\r\nallies and should refrain from pursuing their special\r\ninterests through those groups.\r\nThirdly, while the fight against terrorism and its\r\nsupporters goes on, special care must be taken to\r\nensure that innocent civilians are kept out of harm’s\r\nway. All humanitarian support should be provided,\r\norganized and facilitated.\r\nFourthly, in regions and cities of Afghanistan\r\nfreed from terrorist oppression, the United Nations and\r\ninvolved forces should act immediately to ensure\r\nsecurity and relief. The success in providing for basic\r\nneeds and displaying the ability to produce a better\r\nfuture will be paramount in expanding positive changes\r\nto other parts of the country. Setting a successful\r\nprecedent would serve as the best catalyst.\r\nFifthly, and finally, everyone seems to agree that\r\nthe future administration and Government of\r\nAfghanistan should reflect all ethnicities. It should also\r\nencompass all political trends that have not resorted to\r\nterrorism. In this process, overemphasizing or\r\nundermining the role of any group in the country would\r\nbe counterproductive. It is evident that in the process\r\nof rebuilding Afghanistan, the United Nations has to\r\nplay a leading role. It is the duty of each and every\r\nMember State of the Organization to contribute to this\r\ngigantic task.\r\nI will touch upon one more issue, and the rest will\r\nbe distributed in the paper that I have prepared. This\r\nlast issue is: Cyprus. The Cyprus issue has remained\r\nfor 38 years. This subject is one that is known to the\r\nUnited Nations. As the dates for some radical changes\r\nin Cyprus through the Greek Cypriot side’s unilateral\r\naccession to the European Union seem to be suggested,\r\nand as Turkey considers these changes potentially\r\ndangerous for the two parties and for the whole region,\r\nthis issue needs further attention. Any artificially\r\nimposed solution that is not mutually acceptable to\r\nboth nations in the island and to the guarantor countries\r\nis bound to create a severe crisis. Turkey, as well as the\r\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), aspire\r\nto a mutually acceptable solution, sought through all\r\npossible means.\r\nA unilateral act by the Greek Cypriots, in\r\nviolation of the 1959-1960 system, and pretending to\r\nrepresent both nations, contradicts the legal framework\r\nand the realities of Cyprus. The legal and practical\r\nrealities do not permit any party in the island to decide\r\nunilaterally to enter any international body of which\r\nboth Turkey and Greece are not members; and any such\r\ndecision has to be taken mutually by the two co-\r\nfounders.\r\nThrough formal decisions of their parliaments\r\nand Governments, both Turkey and the TRNC have\r\ndeclared that they will not accept any solution that is\r\nnot freely negotiated and mutually accepted. Both\r\nTurkey and the TRNC have also made it clear that they\r\nreject any such development, which would make the\r\nTurkish Cypriots a minority under Greek Cypriot rule.\r\nThe Turkish Government will not allow the resurgence\r\nof a situation that in 1964 and 1974 caused massive\r\ncrimes to be committed against the Turkish Cypriots.\r\nTurkey and the TRNC are for a solution based on\r\nthe realities of the island. There are two distinct nations\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nwith different religions, languages and cultures with\r\ntwo separate States and democracies in Cyprus. The\r\nconfederation proposal of President Denktaş deserves\r\nserious consideration. We also support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Mission of Good Offices and his efforts to\r\nstart a new phase of talks. In order to succeed, this\r\ninitiative should depart from sufficient common\r\nground.\r\nTurkey welcomes the recent proposal of President\r\nDenktaş to his Greek Cypriot counterpart that they get\r\ntogether informally, without any preconditions, and\r\ndiscuss all relevant issues in order to find a way\r\nforward. The refusal of the Greek Cypriot party is in no\r\none’s interest.\r\nThe tragedy of 11 September can be viewed as an\r\nomen of what can happen if the slightest carelessness is\r\nshown towards any of the old and new threats the\r\nworld faces in the modern age, be they terrorism,\r\nenvironment or poverty.\r\nAll I have said points to the need for the strong\r\ncommitment of Member countries to efforts aimed at\r\nthe shaping of a better future. I point as well to the\r\nneed to strengthen and streamline the United Nations,\r\nwith all its principal organs. This General Assembly\r\nsession of 2001 is a meaningful link in the chain which\r\nthe international community has forged to meet the\r\ngrowing challenges of the new century. With realism\r\nand courage we shall succeed.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Joschka Fischer, Deputy Chancellor\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany.\r\nMr. Fischer (Germany) (spoke in German;\r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation):\r\nOnly a few moments ago, we were informed of the\r\ncrash of a commercial airliner not far from here, in\r\nQueens. At the moment, we do not know the cause of\r\nthis disaster, but we are shocked and horrified. I would\r\nexpress to the bereaved families and to the American\r\npeople our sincere condolences and sympathy.\r\nIt has been only two months since thousands of\r\ninnocent persons lost their lives in the World Trade\r\nCenter here in New York. Today, we are seeing the\r\nextent to which the people here have been affected. In\r\nthe entire history of the United Nations, there has never\r\nbeen a situation like this one.\r\nThroughout the world, people have expressed\r\ntheir sincere solidarity with and commiseration for the\r\nvictims and their families. These horrific terrorist\r\nattacks struck not just Americans, but also innocent\r\npeople from over 80 countries, members of all the\r\nmajor world religions and cultures. They targeted us\r\nall. It must therefore be a common concern of humanity\r\nto prevent a recurrence of this tragedy or indeed\r\nsomething even worse.\r\nThe events of 11 September thrust a dangerous\r\nfuture upon the world. We now live in the terrible\r\nknowledge that no country in the globalized world is\r\ninvulnerable and that enemies within, who are\r\ndetermined to kill and to die, can perpetrate mass\r\nmurder at any time. This eerie, awful danger has at a\r\nstroke dramatically altered the foundations of security\r\npolicy as we know it. The fight against internationally\r\noperative terrorist networks will require new responses\r\nfrom the community of States. International terrorism\r\nis a challenge above all for politics, the military, the\r\npolice and the judiciary, as well as for the economy\r\nand — very importantly — for culture. At the dawn of\r\nthe twenty-first century, the issue of peace and security\r\nhas thus taken on an entirely new perspective.\r\nMr. Imanaliev (Kyrgyzstan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nHumanity has rarely been as united as it was on\r\nthat terrible day two months ago. This unity was born\r\nnot only of horror and compassion, but also of the\r\nrealization that we can successfully counter this new\r\ndeadly threat only if we combine our full force and\r\nenergy. The day of 11 September was a defining\r\nmoment that altered the direction of world politics. A\r\nnew alliance was created. It must now be strengthened\r\nand developed into a genuine partnership. If this is\r\nachieved, 11 September could go down in history not\r\nonly as a horrific day for humanity, but also as the\r\nbeginning of a new era of cooperation and\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nWhat drives people to commit these\r\ninconceivable crimes and to blow up themselves and\r\nthousands of innocents? From where does such\r\nuncontrollable hatred come? How can it be curbed?\r\nHow can it be conquered? It is certain that in any\r\nattempt to develop an effective counter-strategy we\r\nmust, while waging the war on terrorism, analyse the\r\nfull range of causes and circumstances that permit such\r\nhatred and violence to grow.\r\nThe United Nations is uniquely suited to the task\r\nahead. It provides the forum required for the creation\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nof a universal coalition. Only it can give international\r\nlegitimacy to the response to terrorism. It has at its\r\ndisposal the instruments to manage political conflicts\r\nand the underlying development problems that nurture\r\nhatred and despair.\r\nA comprehensive strategy against terrorism must\r\nconcentrate primarily on prevention. Developing such a\r\nstrategy means nothing less than drafting a policy for a\r\ncooperative world order for the twenty-first century, a\r\npolicy that no longer tolerates areas characterized by a\r\nbreakdown of order, a policy that has as its goal a\r\nworld order under which all peoples can claim their\r\nfull and equitable share. This includes making\r\neconomic globalization more socially just for more\r\npeople and supplementing it with the political\r\nglobalization so urgently needed.\r\nThe Security Council responded to 11 September\r\nwith rare solidarity and, with resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nand 1373 (2001), took decisions on concrete,\r\ninternationally binding anti-terrorism measures that\r\npoint the way ahead. The General Assembly, too,\r\nseverely condemned the terrorist attacks and called for\r\njoint action against international terrorism.\r\nThis path must now be rigorously pursued with\r\nthe rapid and universal ratification and implementation\r\nof the 12 United Nations anti-terrorism conventions\r\nand the adoption of a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism. We must endeavour anew to\r\nbring this project, on which we all place so much hope,\r\nto a successful conclusion. I therefore call upon all\r\nStates that have not yet approved the present\r\ncompromise to reconsider their position.\r\nThe International Criminal Court can also become\r\na valuable instrument in the fight against terrorism.\r\nUnder article 7, paragraph 1, of its statute, it will have\r\njurisdiction to try cases of murder “when committed as\r\npart of a widespread or systematic attack directed\r\nagainst any civilian population”. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the attacks on New York, Washington and\r\nPennsylvania fulfil this requirement. For this reason, I\r\nwould like to ask you all once again to ratify the Rome\r\nStatute as quickly as possible.\r\nThe attack on the World Trade Center was a\r\nwake-up call to the profound threat to world peace that\r\ncan be posed by failing States. Areas where political\r\nand social order has collapsed offer terrorists a safe\r\nhaven from which they can organize their murderous\r\nnetworks worldwide. The community of States urgently\r\nneeds to take a closer and preventive look at the\r\nproblem of failing States — but not just in\r\nAfghanistan, and not only after a catastrophe has\r\noccurred.\r\nNo conflict prevention measures have ever been\r\nundertaken in Afghanistan. Far from it. This has\r\nproved to be a fatal error. For more than 20 years, a\r\nhumanitarian catastrophe has been playing itself out\r\nbefore the eyes of the world, in which women and\r\nchildren, in particular, have suffered. Civil war, human\r\nrights violations and abject misery have also been the\r\nnourishing ground for the unprecedented symbiosis\r\nbetween the terrorists of the Al Qaeda group and the\r\nTaliban regime.\r\nFrom there the trail leads directly to the horrific\r\nattacks in the United States. As hard as this decision\r\nmay be, without the use of military means, this threat\r\ncannot be averted. We must not forget that the suffering\r\nof the people in Afghanistan is above all the work of\r\nthe Taliban. It was the Taliban that, long before 11\r\nSeptember, increasingly impeded effective\r\nhumanitarian relief, robbed women and girls of all their\r\nrights and actively supported terrorism, also with the\r\ngoal of destabilizing Arab and Muslim States.\r\nNot to react would indeed be to invite further\r\nterror and oppression and would be extremely\r\ndangerous for world peace. The dramatic nature of this\r\nthreat is illustrated by Osama bin Laden’s statement\r\nthat he will not shrink from using even nuclear\r\nweapons. Civilian means alone are unfortunately not\r\nalways enough to put an end to violence and terror.\r\nThis was the case in the Balkans.\r\nIn Afghanistan, too, the root of the tragic conflict\r\nis profoundly political, and so the solution, too, can\r\nultimately only be a political one. It must come from\r\nwithin, must reflect the diversity of peoples in Afghan\r\nsociety and must be accepted by the Afghan people.\r\nBut a peaceful solution also requires assistance from\r\nthe international community. Afghanistan must not be\r\nleft alone with its problems yet again.\r\nA clear political and humanitarian perspective for\r\nAfghanistan is now crucial. The United Nations should\r\nbe the coordinating agency for all peace efforts. It is\r\nindispensable as the framework for the political\r\nprocess and as the guarantor of internal agreements\r\nwithin Afghanistan. Only a peace process under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations will succeed in\r\nexcluding external involvement in the future and\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nensuring a peaceful future for the country in harmony\r\nwith its neighbours. Germany and the European Union\r\nare willing to play their part towards a political\r\nsolution for Afghanistan and to participate in the long\r\nterm in the economic and social reconstruction of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nMore than anything, the refugees and the civilian\r\npopulation must be helped. We cannot tolerate the fact\r\nthat the Taliban is hindering humanitarian access and is\r\nusing the civilian population as a shield. Especially\r\nbecause of the approaching winter, we must do\r\neverything in our power to provide the people with at\r\nleast the most basic necessities and to alleviate their\r\ndespair and hardship. Is it possible to establish\r\nhumanitarian protected areas, to use the expulsion of\r\nthe Taliban from Mazar-e-Sharif and other towns to\r\nimprove the humanitarian situation, and to make a\r\ntown like Kabul an open city? Of course this will be\r\nvery difficult, but let us nevertheless think without\r\ntaboos about absolutely all ways in which we could\r\nhelp the people. As chair of the Afghanistan Support\r\nGroup, Germany has issued an invitation to a meeting\r\nin Berlin at the beginning of December. I appeal to all\r\nStates to make a great humanitarian effort now and to\r\ncome to the aid of the downtrodden Afghan people.\r\nSolving regional conflicts will be of critical\r\nimportance in the fight against terrorism. The Middle\r\nEast conflict is a top priority. Our hearts go out to the\r\nmany innocent victims on all sides. Both the Israeli and\r\nPalestinian peoples have a right to live free of fear, in\r\ndignity and in peace. This is indivisible not only from\r\nIsrael’s right of statehood, as recognized in Madrid —\r\nwhich is, in our view, inviolable — but also from its\r\nsecurity. Germany bears a special responsibility\r\ntowards Israel stemming from its past. Any policy that\r\naims at destroying Israel by means of terrorism or\r\notherwise will face determined opposition from\r\nGermany. However, we equally advocate the\r\nPalestinians’ right to self-determination and their right\r\nto their own State, Palestine. In the European Union\r\nBerlin Declaration of March 1999 we stated that “the\r\ncreation of a democratic, viable and peaceful sovereign\r\nPalestinian State on the basis of existing agreements\r\nand through negotiations would be the best guarantee\r\nof Israel’s security”. This is truer today than ever\r\nbefore.\r\nNever before has there been broader international\r\nbacking for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict. The Mitchell recommendations still form the\r\nbasis for the timetable accepted by all sides, and in\r\ntheir spirit we call on Israelis and Palestinians alike to\r\nput an immediate and lasting end to violence and\r\nconfrontation, to resume the agreed direct talks without\r\ndelay and to seriously implement the negotiated\r\nceasefires. These talks must lead to genuine\r\nnegotiations on a viable political solution.\r\nThe real aim of the terrorists is to trigger a clash\r\nof civilizations and to inflame the situation in the Near\r\nand Middle East. Under no circumstances can we allow\r\nourselves to be drawn into such a conflict. We are\r\nfighting international terrorism, not Islam.\r\nWe must counter the terrorist strategy designed to\r\nbring about the clash of civilizations with a dialogue of\r\ncultures and religions. We need a spiritual debate based\r\non mutual understanding that attempts to reach genuine\r\nagreement on the fundamental values that unite us.\r\nSuch a dialogue presupposes the existence of shared\r\nvalues, but also respect for other traditions and\r\ndifferences between peoples. However, one thing must\r\nbe clear: human rights are universal, not Western\r\nvalues. Consensus was reached on them by the\r\ninternational community of States in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the human rights conventions.\r\nAny dialogue must build on the universality of\r\nhuman rights. It must be conducted with respect for the\r\ndignity of all involved, in tolerance and openness. It\r\nmust start at home, within cultures themselves. It can\r\nbear fruit only if it is pursued free of all constraint.\r\nAnd it has a purpose only if all participants are also\r\nready to offer self-criticism.\r\nThe insidious anthrax attacks since 11 September\r\nshow that the threat from weapons of mass destruction\r\nin terrorist hands, which yesterday seemed abstract, is\r\ntoday a real and deadly danger. The community of\r\nStates must do everything in its power to counter it\r\nwith a new push for non-proliferation and global\r\ndisarmament.\r\nThe dangers of the dissemination of weapons to\r\nnon-State groups and of regional arms races require\r\nnew answers and effective, internationally enforceable\r\ncriminal sanctions. In the nuclear field, the\r\ncommitment contained in the Non-Proliferation Treaty\r\nto complete nuclear disarmament remains crucial. As\r\nregards biological weapons, in view of the acute threat,\r\neffective global control mechanisms must finally be\r\ncreated. The Chemical Weapons Convention must be\r\nmore rigorously implemented. All States are called\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nupon to participate in the negotiation of an\r\ninternational code of conduct on ballistic missile\r\nproliferation.\r\nThe fight now beginning against terrorism must\r\nbuild on the awareness that the first world cannot in the\r\nlong term live secure and safe from the tensions and\r\nconflicts of the third world. Almost one quarter of the\r\nworld population is starving. Ninety-five per cent of\r\nthose infected with AIDS live in developing countries.\r\nAfrica is particularly hard hit. At present only a\r\nminority of the world’s citizens profit from the\r\nopportunities for growth offered by globalization and\r\nfrom the use of the new information technologies. This\r\nstate of affairs cannot be accepted, even by the rich\r\ncountries — for moral reasons, but also because\r\ntensions and conflicts today spread much more quickly\r\nand widely than ever before.\r\nThe battle against poverty cannot be won unless\r\nwe take equally determined steps to preserve the\r\nnatural resources on which life depends. At the coming\r\nWorld Summit in Johannesburg we must make a\r\nquantum leap forward towards sustainable\r\ndevelopment, improved poverty eradication and better\r\nmanagement of our natural resources. The Kyoto\r\nProtocol must enter into force next year. And we must\r\nstrengthen the sole advocate of the global environment,\r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme,\r\ninstitutionally, operationally and financially.\r\n11 September made it horrifyingly clear that the\r\nhuman race will not be able to live in peace and\r\nsecurity in the absence of political order at the global\r\nand regional levels.\r\nGermany will continue to do its utmost to bring\r\nabout the strengthening of the United Nations and its\r\ncapacity to act, so that the world will be a more\r\npeaceful, just and humane place in the twenty-first\r\ncentury than it was in the twentieth century. The future\r\nbelongs to responsible governance for one world,\r\ngovernance based not on hegemonic claims, but on\r\ncooperation, solidarity and multilateralism. If together\r\nwe succeed in implementing such a policy, we will not\r\njust ultimately win the war against terrorism but will\r\nalso be able to eradicate its roots forever.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency The Honourable John Briceño, Deputy\r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources,\r\nEnvironment, Commerce and Industry of Belize.\r\nMr. Briceño (Belize): We understand that an\r\nAmerican Airlines flight to the Dominican Republic\r\nhas gone down in Queens. We extend the condolences\r\nand the support of my Government to the United States\r\nand the Dominican Republic.\r\nThat we have forged ahead with the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly and that political\r\nleaders have assembled for the general debate mark an\r\nextraordinary accomplishment, one that brings great\r\ncredibility to the United Nations. I applaud and thank\r\nall who reside in this great city for continuing their\r\nwork. Today, more than ever, our efforts and energies\r\nshould focus on implementing the purposes and\r\nprinciples of our Charter and should inspire hope and\r\nconfidence in all humanity.\r\nForeign Minister Han Seung-soo, on behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I extend congratulations to him on his\r\nelection as President of the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nAssembly. The manner in which he has guided our\r\nwork thus far is outstanding and worthy of our\r\nrecognition. We wish him continued success as he\r\npresides over this Assembly. To the Secretary-General\r\nand to the United Nations, we extend congratulations\r\non being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nBefore I proceed, please allow me, on behalf of\r\nthe Belizean people, to extend to the President and the\r\npeople of the United States of America, especially to\r\nthe people of New York City, our heartfelt condolences\r\non the tremendous loss suffered on 11 September.\r\nFor most of us, the immediate reaction to this\r\ntragedy was one of shock and disbelief. As we joined\r\nin mourning the loss of innocent lives, including some\r\nof our own nationals, the international community\r\nmoved swiftly to adopt a number of resolutions here at\r\nthe United Nations. Through these actions we\r\nforcefully condemned acts of terrorism and reached out\r\nto the United States of America in solidarity, firm in\r\nour support to uphold the principles of justice and the\r\nmaintenance of peace.\r\nToday, despots feast in the raging rivers of\r\ndesperation, seeking refuge among the weak, preying\r\nupon the vulnerabilities of the less fortunate. Those\r\nwho are caught in the sweeping currents of poverty,\r\nforced to live in a world were a dollar is a luxury, find\r\nlittle hope for a better future and are often abused by\r\nthose who manipulate them for selfish and destructive\r\nreasons. For us, securing a better future for the millions\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nwho live in poverty continues to be our most noble of\r\nchallenges.\r\nTo meet this challenge, the United Nations must\r\nremain true to its task as set forth in the Charter and\r\nreaffirmed just over a year ago when our heads of State\r\nand Government gathered here and adopted the\r\nMillennium Declaration. That Declaration outlines\r\nvarious issues critical to the realization of a world with\r\nless poverty, death and despair, exhorting the values of\r\nfreedom, equality, justice and tolerance. We must not\r\nallow the events of 11 September to cause us to lose\r\nour focus on this righteous undertaking — we must\r\nstay the course.\r\nFor Belize, the path to fulfilling the goals of the\r\nMillennium Declaration begins with addressing the\r\nissues of development and poverty eradication. We\r\nconfirm our support for the Agenda for Development.\r\nAs a small State working to provide greater\r\nopportunities for its people, especially those who live\r\nin poverty, meaningful sustainable development is\r\ncritical and can be achieved only through partnership\r\nwith the international community. Regional and global\r\ncooperation are fundamental components for progress\r\nand necessitate a universal acceptance of our shared\r\nresponsibility to create opportunities for growth and\r\ndevelopment. Please allow me to say a few words in\r\nSpanish.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nGlobalization amply demonstrates our\r\ninterdependence and the importance of cooperation\r\nwith the rest of the world based on the principle of\r\nmutual respect. Genuine sustainable development\r\nrequires inclusive and transparent trading practices that\r\nallow for the participation of developing countries in\r\nthe global economy. The geographical location of\r\nBelize enables us to participate in the Caribbean\r\nCommunity and the Central American Integration\r\nSystem, which gives us the opportunity to offer\r\ndifferent perspectives in the fight against poverty. At\r\nthe same time, it increases our possibilities for greater\r\nparticipation in all entities concerned with developing\r\ninnovative mechanisms to efficiently integrate our\r\neconomies into the global economic system. In this\r\nrespect, we consider that equitable and participatory\r\ncooperation in which our concerns and vulnerabilities\r\nwill receive the attention they deserve is fundamental.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe twenty-sixth special session of the General\r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS, held last June, brought the\r\ninternational community together to collectively affirm\r\nthe urgent need for critical action on the part of all\r\nstakeholders to combat this pandemic. For us in the\r\nCaribbean, the Conference was of special importance.\r\nRanked the second highest region in rate of HIV/AIDS\r\ninfection after sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean States\r\nare working with their international partners to combat\r\nthe spread of this deadly disease. Any progress made\r\nduring the HIV/AIDS special session must be\r\nattributed to the collaborative spirit displayed by all\r\nthose involved, at both the political and technical\r\nlevels. The inclusion of civil society, as well as the\r\nprivate sector, contributed to the effectiveness of the\r\nconference and remains critical to the success of any\r\nprogramme to eradicate HIV/AIDS. We welcome the\r\ndecision of the Secretary-General to reach out to the\r\nentire world community to assist in the establishment\r\nof the Global HIV/AIDS and Health Fund, in an effort\r\nto help alleviate the suffering of the millions of people\r\nafflicted by the scourge.\r\nThe protection and preservation of our\r\nenvironment is a major concern to the developing\r\nworld, as so many of us depend on our natural\r\nresources for our survival. The commitments made by\r\nthe international community for the protection of the\r\nenvironment have not been implemented, and if they\r\nare not addressed urgently, the consequences will\r\nimpact negatively our small dependent economies, as\r\nwell as the economy of the global community. We\r\nattach great importance to the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and\r\nwelcome the successful results of the recently\r\nconcluded meeting in Marrakech, hoping to see more\r\nStates ratify the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nIn the Central America and the Caribbean regions\r\nwe perpetually suffer from the effects of natural\r\ndisasters, with the number and intensity of hurricanes\r\nincreasing over the last decade. This has been\r\nattributed to the effects of climate change caused by\r\nglobal warming. For two consecutive years, Belize has\r\nbeen struck by category-four hurricanes, magnifying\r\nthe need to protect our environment and minimize our\r\nvulnerabilities. It is imperative that we gear our efforts\r\ntowards creating the necessary mechanisms to reverse\r\nand curtail negative actions that contribute to the\r\ndeterioration of the state of our environment. For this\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nreason, Belize, along with its partners in the Caribbean\r\nregion, continues to seek the support of the United\r\nNations for a special regime for the Caribbean Sea.\r\nIf we are to speak of shared responsibility for\r\ndevelopment and the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity, this year especially we must ensure that\r\neveryone be allowed to participate in this global forum.\r\nIn this light, we continue to appeal to this Organization\r\nto consider the right of the 23 million people of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and allow their voices to\r\nbe heard in this world institution. Equally, we must\r\ncontinue to advocate recognition of the Palestinian\r\npeople’s right to self-determination, including the right\r\nto their independent State.\r\nWith respect to our commitment to the\r\ndevelopment of peace and security, Belize is pleased to\r\nreport the continuation of dialogue with our neighbour,\r\nthe Republic of Guatemala. We continue to support all\r\nefforts to peacefully resolve our differences.\r\nThis year has been designated the United Nations\r\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. The recently\r\nconcluded debate on this agenda item produced\r\nmeaningful discussion on the advantages of diversity\r\nand its benefits to human progress. Enhanced by\r\nglobalization, our actions impact others immediately,\r\ncreating new realities that require more openness and\r\ngreater sensitivity to the differences among us. In our\r\ncountry, where seven languages or dialects are spoken\r\nand diverse ethnic populations live together peacefully,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the prospect of increased\r\ndialogue among civilizations, one inclusive of all\r\npeoples, that will improve upon the understanding of\r\nwho we are and where we came from. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in his report on the United Nations Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, noted the importance of\r\nensuring that the process of globalization be\r\ncomprehensive and fair. Let us grasp the opportunity\r\ngiven to us through this process to work together as\r\nequal partners in this global community, seeking to\r\nunderstand our common objectives while respecting\r\nour differences.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration recognizes the\r\nexisting inequalities in our world. Likewise, it offers a\r\ncomprehensive formula for greater prosperity for all. It\r\ndirects us towards a collective responsibility through\r\ngreater partnership among the countries of the world.\r\nAt this time, when we are faced with new global\r\nrealities, let us make this Declaration meaningful by\r\naccelerating our efforts to achieve the just objectives of\r\nlasting peace and prosperity for all of our peoples.\r\nMr. Gadio (Senegal) (spoke in French): Pending\r\nfurther news, I also wish to share in the sadness we all\r\nfeel on the announcement of an aeroplane crash in\r\nQueens.\r\nThrough me, Senegal has the pleasure of\r\naddressing its warm congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo on his brilliant election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nHis election clearly is a tribute to his outstanding\r\nqualities as a diplomat and statesman and it also\r\nexpresses the unanimous recognition of the Member\r\nStates of our Organization of his country, the Republic\r\nof Korea, for its steadfast commitment to the service of\r\nuniversal peace and international cooperation.\r\nI wish to express to his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, our deep\r\ngratitude for the competence, commitment and spirit of\r\nopenness with which he discharged his mandate during\r\na particularly heavy year.\r\nFinally, I am happy to reiterate Senegal’s deep\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, and at the same time to reiterate to\r\nhim our wholehearted compliments on his historic re-\r\nelection, the dazzling consecration of outstanding\r\nqualities of a man of good will, conviction and vision,\r\nwho has devoted his life to the noble causes of the\r\nUnited Nations. I also congratulate him on the brilliant\r\nrecognition he and the United Nations have just\r\nreceived as the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.\r\nHe deserves our full support in the pursuit and the\r\nachievement of the outstanding work in the area of\r\nreform in which he, along with his colleagues, is fully\r\ninvested to bring our Organization closer to the\r\nrealities of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe terrorist attempts of 11 September, which\r\ntragically struck New York, the Headquarters of our\r\nOrganization, Washington and Pennsylvania, have\r\nradically changed our vision of the world and of\r\ninternational relations. My country, Senegal, once\r\nagain conveys its sympathy to the people of the United\r\nStates and reiterates its heartfelt condolences to the\r\nbereaved families.\r\nLet us say it unambiguously: there is no moral,\r\nreligious or political cause noble enough to justify\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nterrorism or its always barbarous manifestations —\r\nwhich all of us without exception must condemn with\r\nunwavering unity and with the utmost force.\r\nSenegal is a secular democratic country whose\r\npopulation is more than 90 per cent Muslim; we reject\r\nall forms of confrontation between religions, cultures\r\nor civilizations. Senegal believes that Islam, like other\r\nrevealed religions, is a faith of peace and tolerance, and\r\nvigorously condemns any equation of Islam with\r\nterrorism and any attempt to invoke or use religion for\r\ncriminal purposes. The massacre of pregnant women\r\nand the destruction of buildings occupied by innocent\r\ncivilians — God’s creatures every one — are acts that\r\nhave no justification in any religion, least of all Islam,\r\nwhose banner of peace and harmony among men and\r\nwomen, peoples, cultures and civilizations we proudly\r\nbear.\r\nBeyond simply condemning terrorism in all its\r\nforms, methods and manifestations, the international\r\ncommunity must act firmly to eradicate terrorism, its\r\nsources of financing and its bases of action throughout\r\nthe world.\r\nSenegal is committed to that course, which is why\r\nHis Excellency President Abdoulaye Wade took the\r\nwell known initiative of convening on 17 October at\r\nDakar an African conference against terrorism, in\r\nwhich 27 countries participated. President Wade\r\nsubmitted to that forum a draft African pact against\r\nterrorism as a needed complement to the Organization\r\nof African Unity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention\r\nand Combating of Terrorism. The conference ended\r\nwith the adoption of the Dakar Declaration against\r\nTerrorism, which firmly condemned terrorism in all its\r\nforms; reaffirmed our solidarity with all victims of\r\nterrorist acts, in particular the thousands of innocent\r\ncivilian citizens of countries throughout the world who\r\ndied on 11 September; and invited the OAU promptly\r\nto convene an extraordinary session on terrorism to\r\nconsider, inter alia, the draft African pact against\r\nterrorism submitted by Senegal with the support of\r\nother countries.\r\nLet me make it clear that those who argue that\r\nAfrica has priorities other than terrorism are surely\r\nforgetting that tragedy resulting from acts of blind\r\nslaughter struck first in Africa: in Kenya and Tanzania.\r\nWith bald lack of consideration and respect for African\r\nlives, bombers in Nairobi killed 12 United States\r\nnationals and 212 Kenyans and wounded more than\r\n3,000 of our Kenyan brothers and sisters. They have\r\nnever expressed any regret, much less remorse, for\r\ntheir obvious contempt for us. Fighting international\r\nterrorism means saying loud and clear that Africans,\r\nlike Europeans, Americans and all the other peoples of\r\nthe world, have an equal right to safety, security,\r\nstability and peace.\r\nThat is the powerful message that His Excellency\r\nPresident Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal wants to echo\r\nthroughout the world. Let us remember his initiative\r\nfor a genuine security policy in Africa, along with his\r\ninitiative to review African debt and his Omega\r\nPlan — a genuine African globalization strategy which\r\nhas now been merged with the Millennium Partnership\r\nfor African Recovery to form the New African\r\nInitiative.\r\nThere are years that the long march of history\r\ncannot conceal or obliterate, and the past 12-month\r\nperiod is undoubtedly among these; it was\r\nextraordinarily rich in events of great importance both\r\nfor the United Nations and for Africa, the seat of\r\nhumankind. Thus, within the framework of the fifty-\r\nfifth session, the Millennium Summit brought together\r\nin this Hall heads of State or Government to, in the\r\nfelicitous words of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, identify and work to solve the world’s major\r\nproblems.\r\nIn an extraordinary convergence of views, world\r\nleaders reaffirmed their faith in the United Nations and\r\nits irreplaceable mission to protect international peace\r\nand security, to fight poverty, to promote economic and\r\nsocial development, to strengthen democracy and the\r\nrule of law and to ensure justice and equity among\r\ncitizens, peoples, cultures and civilizations.\r\nIn view of the universality which is the hallmark\r\nof the United Nations and which was reaffirmed at the\r\nMillennium Summit, Senegal firmly supports the\r\nlegitimate request of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nto resume its seat in the Organization and in its\r\nspecialized agencies. That request is not directed\r\nagainst any State Member of the United Nations; meeting\r\nit would be a key contribution to consolidating the\r\nideal of the universality of the United Nations and to\r\nthe advent of an era of peace and stability in that\r\nsensitive part of the world.\r\nAfrica remains the region where some conflicts\r\nseem to exist in tragic eternity; it is where nearly half\r\nof the world’s refugees and displaced persons are to be\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nfound; it is the site of 33 of the world’s 48 least\r\ndeveloped countries. Africa is also the region whose\r\ninhabitants are the most appallingly affected by the\r\nHIV/AIDS and malaria pandemics. Unquestionably,\r\nthat enormously disturbing situation calls out to the\r\nentire international community and, in particular, to\r\nAfricans. That is why it is important to implement the\r\noutcome of the twenty-sixth special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which was devoted to the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS.\r\nLast July, the African Union was christened at the\r\nhistoric Lusaka summit of the OAU. By that historic\r\nact, Africa committed itself, in a proactive and unified\r\nspirit, to find African solutions to the many challenges\r\nbefore it, by establishing a modern, viable, open\r\ninstitutional framework that can respond to Africa’s\r\nemergencies and needs in the new century. Here, I\r\nrenew my congratulations to my friend and brother\r\nAmara Essy, to whom African heads of State or\r\nGovernment have entrusted the task of following Salim\r\nAhmed Salim in shouldering the high responsibilities\r\nof the post of Secretary-General of the OAU and of\r\nputting in place the new structures of the African\r\nUnion.\r\nThe second major event of the Lusaka summit is\r\npart of the same pan-African dynamic: the adoption of\r\na plan for the economic and social development of\r\nAfrica, known as the New African Initiative — the new\r\npartnership for the development of Africa, to which I\r\nearlier referred. This has the quality of having been\r\nconceived by Africans for Africa on the basis of the\r\nmerger of two novel projects: the Omega Plan of\r\nPresident Abdoulaye Wade; and the programme for an\r\nAfrican renaissance of Presidents Thabo Mbeki of\r\nSouth Africa, Abelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria and\r\nOlusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria. That joint initiative\r\nshould help create the synergy needed to eradicate\r\npoverty in Africa and to lay the foundations for\r\nsustainable economic and social development, which is\r\na prerequisite for integrating the continent into the\r\nongoing process of globalization.\r\nFor the first time in the history of plans for the\r\nrenewal of Africa, an international conference on the\r\nfinancing of the New African Initiative is planned for\r\nJanuary 2002 at Dakar. That forum will truly be an\r\nAfrican Davos and should make it possible to hold a\r\nfruitful dialogue among all development partners that\r\nhave understood the renewal heralded by the new plan,\r\nwhich sums up our experiences and symbolizes the\r\nhopes of all of us who unconditionally love Africa.\r\nThere has been impressive progress in Africa this\r\nyear with respect to the urgent need to tackle the root\r\ncauses of the many conflicts that shake the continent\r\nand to work peacefully towards their lasting resolution.\r\nOn the crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nin Burundi and in Sierra Leone, we are pleased to say\r\nthat significant milestones have been reached by all\r\nactors in the implementation of peace agreements\r\nalready concluded.\r\nFrom that standpoint, there is true cause for\r\nencouragement in the beginning of an inter-Congolese\r\ndialogue in Gaborone, Botswana, and the recent\r\nformation, with the help of the incomparable Nelson\r\nMandela, of the transitional government of Burundi for\r\nnational reconciliation. It is now up to the Security\r\nCouncil to perform all of its responsibilities under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter. These efforts deserve to be\r\nintensified and given diplomatic support by the\r\ninternational community through concrete actions to\r\nfinance strategies for post-conflict peace-building. In\r\nthe same spirit, it is important to support the efforts of\r\nAngola and the Organization of African Unity for the\r\nrapid settlement of the conflict in that country.\r\nIn light of the debt crisis aggravated by the\r\nexponential drop in official development assistance, the\r\ninternational community must explore new ways and\r\nmeans to develop the third world, especially Africa,\r\nthrough, inter alia, an increase in direct foreign\r\ninvestment. It is this break with the past — this\r\n“epistemological” departure — that our President\r\nproposes to Africa and its partners. He argues that the\r\naid/credit couplet, which has been the principal way to\r\nfinance development in Africa and has led to the\r\nimpasse we all know, should be abandoned and\r\nreplaced by an approach that makes Africa attractive\r\nand competitive, leading to a massive inflow of private\r\ninvestment, both domestic and international.\r\nThe cycle of debt followed by ever greater\r\ndebt — a cycle that has been described by our\r\nPresident as a scourge similar to the slavery that\r\ndevastated Africa — should give way to an approach\r\nthat brings in massive investment in an adequate fiscal\r\nand legal environment — investment capable of filling\r\nthe gaps in priority sectors such as infrastructure,\r\neducation, health, agriculture, new technologies and\r\naccess to the markets of developed countries. This\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\napproach, of course, would be part of a strategy of\r\ngood political and economic governance and\r\nunqualified respect for the rule of law, democracy and\r\nhuman rights.\r\nAfrica is relying greatly on the results of the\r\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization that just opened in Doha; the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in Monterrey, scheduled for March 2002;\r\nand the World Summit on Sustainable Development in\r\nJohannesburg, planned for September, to provide\r\ninnovative solutions to the challenges besetting Africa\r\nat the beginning of this millennium.\r\nLooking sadly toward the Middle East, Senegal is\r\nfollowing recent developments with great concern and\r\nfeels solidarity with the Palestinian people in light of\r\nthe new tragedy. Horrified by the scope of this tragedy,\r\nSenegal condemns the Israeli occupation of Palestinian\r\nterritories and the intensification of acts of violence\r\nagainst innocent civilians. Senegal addresses an earnest\r\nappeal to all the parties, the co-sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess, the European Union, the Security Council and\r\nthe international community, for the withdrawal of\r\nIsraeli forces from the occupied Palestinian areas; for\r\nthe immediate cessation of all acts of violence and\r\nprovocation; for respect for the Geneva Convention\r\nRelative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time\r\nof War and the relevant United Nations resolutions; for\r\nthe resumption of peace negotiations in accordance\r\nwith the agreed timetable; and for the conclusion of an\r\noverall settlement agreement that is just, durable and in\r\nconformity with resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973)\r\nof the Security Council.\r\nPeace cannot prosper nor can the development of\r\nthe region be ensured so long as Israelis and\r\nPalestinians fail in their efforts to forge bonds of\r\nconfidence, as sovereign States within internationally\r\nrecognized and guaranteed borders. I am happy to note\r\nthat the European Union and the United States have\r\nrecently affirmed this, inasmuch as Israel and the\r\nfuture State of Palestine each have the right to exist, to\r\nlive in peace and to develop in security and dignity.\r\nI wish to conclude by saying that the\r\nconsolidation of the rule of law and the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nremain one of the major focal points of our national\r\nand foreign policy. The special importance that our\r\nPresident attaches to these matters has been eloquently\r\nexpressed in the appointment of a woman to the post of\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nThe World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\r\nwas held, despite all obstacles, and dealt with its\r\nagenda despite the complexity of the issues and the\r\nparticularly difficult conditions under which the\r\nnegotiations took place. My country, which had the\r\nhonour to preside over the work of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee, once again addresses a solemn appeal to all\r\nactors in international life to translate the Declaration\r\nand Plan of Action adopted at Durban into action.\r\nThus, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the\r\nworld can be definitively freed of the scourge of\r\nracism, which represents a grave infringement of\r\nhuman dignity and a flagrant violation of human rights.\r\nSpeaking of human rights, we also naturally think\r\nof the rights of women and children. The twenty-\r\nseventh special session of the General Assembly,\r\nplanned for 8-10 May 2002, will adopt a new agenda\r\nfor the international community aimed at better\r\nensuring, safeguarding and defending the rights of the\r\nchild and promoting the Convention on that subject.\r\nThe commitments to which our Governments will\r\nsubscribe must be implemented, as must the\r\nconclusions of the Fourth World Youth Forum of the\r\nUnited Nations system, held in Senegal in August this\r\nyear.\r\nIt is imperative that we face the challenges of\r\npeace and development. We have no other choice but to\r\ndo so through multilateralism and universalism. Thus\r\nthe world needs the United Nations, an organization\r\nthat is universal and unique. This is the conviction of\r\nSenegal, which proclaims that a United Nations that is\r\nwell restructured and more representative would be\r\nbetter equipped to face the challenges that humanity\r\nconfronts today. Those challenges seem as immovable\r\nas mountains, but everything is possible in a world of\r\nsolidarity, brotherhood, security and respect for the\r\nsacred character of human life, dignity and the\r\ninalienable right of all peoples to happiness and liberty.\r\nMr. Ásgrímsson (Iceland): Once again, we have\r\nwitnessed a terrible incident in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe United Nations here in New York. Although we do\r\nnot know the circumstances, we are shocked, and it is\r\nclear that many have lost their lives. I express my\r\nsincere condolences to all those who have lost their\r\nloved ones in this tragic incident.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nAllow me to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly.\r\nI am confident that he will guide us wisely through the\r\ncomplex tasks ahead of us in this session.\r\nThe ability of the United Nations to act swiftly in\r\nresponse to acute crisis was seriously tested following\r\nthe terrorist attacks on the United States. During these\r\ntrying times, it has been valuable to have at the helm a\r\nSecretary-General who enjoys such wide support.\r\nLet me congratulate the Secretary-General and\r\nthe United Nations on being awarded the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize — in my view, a well-deserved recognition of\r\nKofi Annan’s leadership and of the dedication he and\r\nhis staff have put into upholding the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. Hopefully, the\r\naward will serve as an inspiration as well as strengthen\r\nworldwide support for the United Nations and what it\r\nstands for.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have radically\r\nchallenged and changed our security environment.\r\nFighting terrorism should therefore become a priority\r\nof the United Nations. We recognize that the United\r\nNations has long been active in the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism, but we now need to go beyond\r\npolitical statements and become truly operational. This\r\nmeans developing new methods and, at the same time,\r\nmaking full use of all the means at the disposal of the\r\nUnited Nations system, the truly global character of the\r\nOrganization and the numerous international legal\r\ninstruments available to us.\r\nIceland strongly supports the creation of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nand hopes that an agreement can be reached on such an\r\ninstrument during the fifty-sixth session. Otherwise, we\r\nwill lose the opportunity to develop the coherent\r\nstrategy lacking today. We cannot fail to react.\r\nThe key role the United Nations should play in\r\nfighting international terrorism must be an impetus to\r\nus to intensify our efforts to achieve a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects.\r\nIceland is seriously concerned about the slow progress\r\nmade towards reaching this goal. It is essential and\r\ntimely that the membership of the Council becomes\r\nmore representative, and thus more likely to sustain the\r\npresent international coalition in the fight against\r\nterrorism. It goes without saying that the efficiency of\r\nthe Council must be secured. Enhancing transparency\r\nin the decision-making process is also of importance,\r\nespecially for non-member States.\r\nOne of the main purposes of the United Nations is\r\nto promote and encourage respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to\r\nrace, sex, language or religion. This continues to be of\r\nthe utmost importance. Let me therefore make it\r\nabsolutely clear that the fight against terrorism is not,\r\nand must not become, a fight against any religious or\r\nethnic group. We must avoid all forms of\r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. Most\r\nimportantly, we must at all times adhere to the basic\r\nvalues of human rights, freedom and democracy.\r\nTurning to the actions at the national level,\r\nIceland is taking the necessary steps to ratify all\r\nrelevant United Nations conventions against terrorism\r\nthat we have not already ratified. Furthermore, Iceland\r\nhas implemented all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, including resolution 1373 (2001). But in\r\nfighting the menace of international terrorism — a\r\nfight that we all agree needs to be both wide-ranging\r\nand forceful — we must, at the end of the day, not in\r\nany way undermine the basic values of our societies —\r\nthose of human rights, the rule of law, and democracy.\r\nWe need to strike a balance between freedom and the\r\nsecurity measures we opt for.\r\nUprooting terrorism in the world must go hand in\r\nhand with solving regional conflicts that threaten\r\ninternational peace and security. This is particularly\r\ntrue for the Middle East. By prolonging the violence\r\nand refusing to negotiate, both sides play into the\r\nhands of extremist elements that want neither a\r\ncontinuation of the peace process nor a political\r\nsolution to the Middle East conflict. Both parties have\r\nto resume negotiations unconditionally. That is the only\r\nway to secure lasting peace in the region, which should\r\nbe based upon the establishment of a viable and\r\ndemocratic Palestinian State and on the right of the\r\nIsraelis to live in peace and security within\r\ninternationally recognized borders. A continuation of\r\nthe present dire conditions cannot be tolerated any\r\nlonger.\r\nI said earlier that the events of 11 September have\r\nmade United Nations reforms even more urgent. The\r\nsame is true for the ongoing work to strengthen the\r\npeacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations. Until\r\nnow, Iceland’s participation in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations has been modest. My country\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nhas participated in peacekeeping by providing civilian\r\npersonnel such as gender experts and police and health\r\nprofessionals. With the changing and more complex\r\nnature of peacekeeping, the need for civilian personnel\r\nhas been increased. The Icelandic Government decided\r\nlast year systematically to increase its contribution to\r\npeacekeeping. Our aim is to provide more personnel to\r\nthe United Nations, as well as to the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European\r\nUnion.\r\nBy adopting resolution 1325 (2000) last year, on\r\nwomen, peace and security, the Security Council\r\nrecognized the importance of incorporating a gender\r\nperspective into peacekeeping operations. When the\r\nUnited Nations becomes involved in peace-building\r\nand reconstruction in Afghanistan we have to make\r\nsure that resolution 1325 (2000) is honoured in the\r\nprocess, for the benefit of Afghan women and, as a\r\nresult, for the Afghan population as a whole. The\r\nUnited Nations must play a key role in the nation-\r\nbuilding process in Afghanistan. Iceland stands ready\r\nto contribute civilian experts should the United Nations\r\nbecome involved in a post-conflict operation.\r\nNext year, 10 years will have passed since world\r\nleaders met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. We\r\nare asked, what has been accomplished in this past\r\ndecade to secure the prosperity of future generations in\r\nharmony with nature? The truth is that there has been\r\nrather little progress and that we face enormous tasks.\r\nThe world community will look towards the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, in Johannesburg,\r\nfor further commitments by all nations.\r\nIn that context, I would like to quote Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who in his opening remarks at the\r\n44th meeting, last Saturday, said\r\n“We must put the issue of sustainability where it\r\nbelongs, in the centre of the policy-making\r\nprocess.”\r\nIt is therefore imperative that we renew our strong\r\ncommitment to sustainable development at the\r\nJohannesburg Summit. We are faced with new\r\nchallenges, but also with new opportunities, namely, to\r\nbuild a global partnership to harness the forces of\r\nglobalization in favour of sustainable development.\r\nThe world community has just achieved, in\r\nMarrakech, a milestone agreement on the\r\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto\r\nnegotiations have been especially difficult. Now we\r\nhave reached the moment when we can bring the\r\nProtocol into force. But more needs to be done to\r\ninclude other key emitters of greenhouse gases in the\r\nbattle against climate change.\r\nIn the area of oceans — the foundation of human\r\nlife — we have made some progress. We have adopted\r\nsignificant agreements, and we are looking at ways to\r\nimprove the assessment of the state of the oceans in\r\norder to further enhance marine protection and\r\nmanagement. New knowledge and new approaches are\r\nalso evolving, thus providing the world community\r\nwith opportunities to improve protection of the oceans\r\nand the sustainable use of their living resources.\r\nLast October, Iceland, in cooperation with the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations and Norway, hosted the Reykjavik Conference\r\non Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem. In a\r\ndocument adopted by the Conference, States declared\r\nthat they would incorporate ecosystem considerations\r\ninto fisheries management with the aim of reinforcing\r\nresponsible and sustainable fisheries in the marine\r\necosystem. This Reykjavik Declaration is a landmark\r\ncontribution of the fisheries nations to the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development. We trust that we\r\nwill see the spirit of the Declaration reflected in the\r\nresults of the World Summit in Johannesburg.\r\nThe time has come for a unified effort by political\r\nleaders, as well as by civil society and the private\r\nsector, to reverse the trend of marginalization and\r\nunderdevelopment. That is why the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nin Mexico next year, offers an unprecedented\r\nopportunity to make a real difference in the lives of\r\nmillions of people throughout the developing world.\r\nThe outcome of the Conference should focus on the\r\ngreat challenge of poverty eradication, as well as on\r\nhow responsibilities between the developed and\r\ndeveloping countries should be shared. We should,\r\nhowever, never lose sight of each State’s primary\r\nresponsibility for its own development. The importance\r\nof responsible national governance and respect for\r\nhuman rights cannot be overstated.\r\nMy focus, like that of many speakers before me,\r\nhas been on the fight against international terrorism.\r\nFighting international terrorism involves all States and\r\ninternational as well as regional organizations. We\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nmust concentrate on the available instruments of each\r\norganization and find ways to adjust them as necessary.\r\nFurthermore, we need to ensure consistency and\r\ncomplementarity of international efforts.\r\nThe malicious acts of 11 September and the latest\r\nshocking news of the suspicion of biological terrorism\r\ndemonstrate that all of our concerted efforts are not\r\nonly necessary but also crucial to fulfilling our duty to\r\nprotect the lives of our citizens.\r\nThe United Nations was founded to preserve\r\npeace and to work for a better world. Terrorists are\r\nfighting against everything the United Nations stands\r\nfor. Fighting against them means fighting for the\r\nUnited Nations, for the future of our civilization and\r\nfor all humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nMrs. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the Federal Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Austria.\r\nMrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria): I am speaking\r\nhere while still in shock over the terrible aeroplane\r\ncrash in Queens, our immediate neighbourhood,\r\nespecially since the area of Rockaway, where so many\r\nbrave New York firefighters live, was already suffering\r\nin the aftermath of the earlier catastrophe. I wish to\r\nexpress my deep sympathy to all those families and to\r\nthe great number of people affected by this tragedy.\r\nLet me at the outset congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to this high office.\r\nWhile assuring him of my delegation’s full cooperation\r\nand support, I am confident that under his guidance and\r\nleadership — which he has already proven in the first\r\ndays of his new function — this session of the General\r\nAssembly will contribute to strengthening global\r\ncooperation and its indispensable platform, the United\r\nNations, in the coming months.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nreiterate my very best wishes to the Secretary-General\r\non his appointment to a second term of office.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to congratulate him very\r\nwarmly on being awarded, jointly with the United\r\nNations, the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour and\r\nrecognition he truly deserves for his leadership,\r\ndedication and courage in the service of our\r\nOrganization. This award also signals recognition of\r\nand encouragement for the United Nations and all those\r\nwho are committed to its mission, not least United\r\nNations staff members.\r\nAllow me to also express here our thanks to the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the many efforts he\r\nundertook not only in conducting day-to-day business,\r\nbut also in revitalizing the United Nations, in particular\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMy colleague, the Foreign Minister of Belgium,\r\nhas already addressed this Assembly on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union. Austria fully endorses his remarks.\r\nTwo months have passed now since the heinous\r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September. Although we are still\r\nin shock at the loss of thousands of innocent lives, we\r\nhave, however, also been encouraged by the resolve\r\nexpressed in the collective response of the community\r\nof nations, here in the General Assembly and in the\r\nSecurity Council. This unanimous strong reaction gives\r\nus hope that today our nations are ready to cross over a\r\nthreshold, leaving behind a world of deadly divisions\r\nand entering a genuine global community.\r\nThere are some positive signs to that effect.\r\nThese are, first, that during the past weeks, we have\r\nwitnessed new astonishing political — maybe even\r\ngeopolitical — alignments that, if followed through,\r\nare comparable to other watershed events of historic\r\nproportions. Secondly, the menace of an\r\nunprecedented, devastating type of terrorism is\r\ncompelling us to take a fresh look at the root causes of\r\nmuch that is unacceptable in our world, according to\r\nour own standards, but which we have been tolerating,\r\nor at least living with, quite contrary to our declared\r\nprinciples. I refer to the abject levels of poverty,\r\ninequality and injustice. These factors are at the origin\r\nof many conflicts around the globe. Some of them are\r\nparticularly dangerous, providing breeding grounds for\r\nglobal terrorism or serving as pretexts for terrorists. It\r\nwould be irresponsible if we — the international\r\ncommunity — did not engage in renewed efforts to find\r\nsolutions to these regional conflicts, be they in the\r\nMiddle East, in Afghanistan, in Kashmir, in the\r\nCaucasus or in the Balkans, as well as in the area\r\naround the Great Lakes, for instance, which has seen so\r\nmuch human suffering.\r\nThe European Union, on a continent marked by\r\ncenturies of war, has developed its model of conflict\r\nresolution. It is held in three words: cooperation,\r\npartnership, integration. The European Union is\r\nengaged in a welcome policy of extending this zone of\r\npeace. We hope that the enlarged Union, planned to\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nbecome a Union of 28 and later more, will be able to\r\ncontribute more effectively to peace and stability in the\r\nworld.\r\nUnder the present circumstances, Austria’s\r\npriorities outside Europe are the Middle East and\r\nCentral Asia, not least because these areas have a direct\r\nbearing on the fight against terrorism in its present\r\nphase.\r\nThe Middle East conflict has been on our agenda\r\nwithout interruption since the time of the creation of\r\nthe United Nations. There is no doubt that we have a\r\nspecial obligation to contribute to a just and viable\r\nsolution. A heightened sense of responsibility is felt\r\nwhen, on the one hand, violence escalates, but when,\r\non the other — as I see it — new opportunities have\r\nemerged. Austria is therefore of the opinion that major\r\nconcerted efforts should be undertaken so that\r\nnegotiations can resume on the basis of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions without delay. Only sincere\r\nnegotiations and a sincere renunciation of violence can\r\nbring a rapprochement of the two parties and, finally,\r\npeace.\r\nAfghanistan is a reminder of what happens when\r\na conflict is neglected too long. Now, there is a new\r\ndimension unfolding. We are forced to act. The\r\nhumanitarian tragedy is obvious. In this context,\r\nCentral Asia deserves increased attention, for example,\r\nin view of assistance in the maintenance of stability\r\nand concertation aiming at the necessary reconstruction\r\nof Afghanistan.\r\nI should like to say a word as to the Balkans, a\r\nneighbouring region to my country. It must not be\r\nneglected, although new dangers emerge elsewhere. In\r\nthe western Balkans, there is progress, especially in\r\nZagreb, in Belgrade, in Tirana and in Sarajevo, but\r\noverall stability and economic recovery are not yet\r\nassured. Extremists have not yet disarmed. We have to\r\nkeep up a high profile of international commitment.\r\nCombating terrorism is, of course, not a one-\r\ndimensional task. It requires cooperation on many\r\nfronts. I see the United Nations as playing a key role in\r\nthis regard. This requires a clarification and\r\ncoordination of tasks within the United Nations system\r\nso as to ensure the necessary synergy. There is also a\r\nrole for regional cooperation. To provide an example, a\r\nso called regional security partnership has been\r\nestablished between Austria and some of its\r\nneighbours, candidates for European Union\r\nmembership, across the boundaries that, for half a\r\ncentury, divided Europe.\r\nOverall, we must address long-term societal\r\ndevelopment at the local, national and global levels and\r\nthe capacities required to build a universally shared\r\npolitical culture based on respect for human rights and\r\nhuman dignity, including for the plurality of identities\r\nat all levels of society.\r\nLet me elaborate now on the United Nations role.\r\nThe time has certainly come to significantly strengthen\r\nthe United Nations capabilities and programmes in\r\ncombating and preventing terrorism. The complexity of\r\nthe challenge requires intersectoral and inter-\r\ninstitutional cooperation. We have to enable the\r\nprincipal organs of the Organization, including their\r\nspecialized subsidiary organs, such as the Security\r\nCouncil’s Committee on terrorism, the General\r\nAssembly’s Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s Commission on Crime\r\nPrevention and Criminal Justice and the appropriate\r\nSecretariat units to perform the tasks that are now\r\nurgently needed.\r\nThe Commission on Crime Prevention and\r\nCriminal Justice will hold a special meeting on\r\nterrorism in the context of the Vienna Declaration on\r\nCrime and Justice on 15 November 2001. Just one\r\nweek prior to the terrorist attacks of 11 September,\r\nplans of action for the implementation of the Vienna\r\nDeclaration were adopted. They will play an important\r\nrole in the system-wide response to international\r\nterrorism, including a comprehensive set of\r\nrecommendations for both national and international\r\naction. These recommendations stress once more the\r\nexisting relationship between terrorism, on the one\r\nhand, and crime, including transnational organized\r\ncrime and illicit drug trafficking, on the other.\r\nThe United Nations Centre for International\r\nCrime Prevention and its Terrorism Prevention Branch\r\nhave received a focused mandate, which should serve\r\nas a solid basis for enhancing the capabilities of the\r\nUnited Nations in the prevention of terrorism. To this\r\nend, the human and financial resources should be\r\nstrengthened accordingly.\r\nNeedless to say, the challenge of terrorism\r\nrequires the full support of each and every\r\nGovernment. Ratification of the various international\r\nlegal instruments, as well as the conclusion of\r\nnegotiations concerning a comprehensive international\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nconvention against terrorism, are of fundamental\r\nimportance. The Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\r\nUnited Nations should also get immediately active in\r\nproviding, where requested, concrete assistance to\r\nMember States in implementing national legislation\r\nrequired by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nas well as in national capacity-building.\r\nSeveral items on our global agenda have\r\nreminded us of the fundamental importance of the\r\nindividual citizen and of society in economic, social,\r\ncultural and institutional development. Increasingly, we\r\nhave understood the strategic role of the basic\r\nprinciples and values of our societies upon which the\r\nfuture of mankind is based. Our rejection of terrorism\r\nmust be absolute. At the same time, we need to\r\nstrengthen our networks and skills in dialogue, cross-\r\nidentification and solidarity.\r\nWe do need a globally shared political culture\r\nthat is based on respect for global diversity, which\r\nfinds its only limits in the right of others to diversity.\r\nWe must never allow fanaticism, violence and\r\nterrorism to undermine the fabric on which peace and\r\nsecurity are built. Now more than ever, we have to\r\nredouble our efforts in the development of our societies\r\nbased on plurality and trust among peoples and\r\ncultures.\r\nIn this context, the Secretary-General’s efforts to\r\npromote dialogue among civilizations, an initiative of\r\nPresident Khatami, can have enormous significance.\r\nAustria had the pleasure of inviting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Group of Eminent Persons for its first\r\nmeeting in Vienna and was honoured by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s personal participation in last summer’s\r\nSalzburg dialogue among civilizations. Austria’s\r\ncommitment to dialogue has found its expression in a\r\nseries of inter-religious encounters, especially between\r\nChristianity and Islam, over the past 10 years. These\r\nencounters have served to identify common values and\r\nto project them into the wider communities. For us,\r\nsuch dialogue has the core objective of developing\r\nsocieties’ capacities in preventing hatred,\r\ndisintegration and politically motivated violence\r\nagainst fellow citizens.\r\nAustria’s efforts have also focused on another\r\nelement of societal development. Long-term strategies\r\nof terrorism prevention require a globally shared\r\nculture of human rights. Let me mention briefly the\r\ngrowing cooperation between qualified regional\r\ninstitutions for human rights education and learning in\r\nAfrica, South Asia, the Far East and the Pacific,\r\nEurope and Latin America. The proclamation of human\r\nrights cities in all of these regions might merit specific\r\nattention by the appropriate organs of the United\r\nNations, including the Commission on Human\r\nSettlements.\r\nWe are aware that there is a direct relationship\r\nbetween the internal negation of human rights, on the\r\none hand, and a culture of violence that may eventually\r\nproject its effects not only internally but also\r\ninternationally and even globally. In view of\r\naccelerated globalization and worldwide economic,\r\ncultural and information relations, we may have to take\r\nproactive measures to strengthen our shared basic\r\nbeliefs and political values through education and\r\nlearning processes. The current United Nations Decade\r\nfor Human Rights Education might also offer\r\nopportunities for appropriate initiatives in response to\r\nthe horrifying scenario of global terrorism.\r\nIn this context, we have to give greater\r\nrecognition to the role of women in providing human\r\nsecurity and human development in all our societies.\r\nThe recognition is due in particular in crisis areas\r\nwhere women have not only been the victims of most\r\nof the intra-societal violence, but have also assured the\r\nsurvival of the neediest.\r\nA case in point is Afghanistan and Afghan\r\nsociety. Eighty-five per cent of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons are women and children. In fact,\r\nthose who are often depicted as the weakest element in\r\nsociety had to bear the brunt of violence and\r\nrepression. As we design our programmes for\r\nreconstructing a post-terrorist Afghanistan, we must\r\nconceive of programmes by which women, in\r\nparticular those now in refugee camps, are enabled to\r\ncontribute their share in a governance of development,\r\npeace and cooperation. This is essential for a society\r\nthat wishes to overcome the scars of decades of\r\nconflict and war. To be concrete, I therefore suggest\r\nthat education and training programmes aimed at\r\nempowering women — in particular, those in refugee\r\ncamps — to assume public responsibility in the\r\nreconstruction of their country be immediately\r\nimplemented.\r\nThe media bear an increasingly important\r\nresponsibility in shaping societies’ value structures and\r\ncapabilities. As Austria’s Federal Chancellor Wolfgang\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nSchüssel said in his statement on the United Nations\r\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations at the General\r\nAssembly’s 42nd meeting, Austria is taking an\r\ninitiative, in the context of the partnership between the\r\nEuropean Union and the Mediterranean countries, that\r\nwill focus on the special role and responsibility of the\r\nmedia in this partnership and in the societal\r\ndevelopment towards accepting and benefiting from the\r\nplurality of cultures and identities in this region.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to make a few\r\ncomments on other very important developments with\r\nregard to items on our global agenda. The sustainable\r\nuse of the local, national, regional and global natural\r\nresources with which we are endowed continues to be\r\nof foremost importance. The recent study by the\r\nInternational Institute for Applied Systems Analysis\r\n(IIASA) on the projected dramatic reduction of\r\nagricultural productivity — between 45 and 55 per cent\r\nin Africa, India, southern China and Latin America —\r\nover the next 50 years due to climate change reminds\r\nus that the processes of long-term global change need\r\nas much action as our activities in coping with crises\r\nand combating criminal terrorism. The World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development in Johannesburg will need\r\nnot only a technical but also a political focus with an\r\nappropriate resolve for our shared global development.\r\nOne specific area where newly shared policies\r\nand institutional support may be required, is the\r\nintegration of energy policies into the global\r\nsustainable development agenda. The Commission on\r\nSustainable Development at its ninth session and the\r\nthird United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries recognized the strong connection\r\nbetween energy-policy interventions and poverty\r\nreduction. Energy considerations should therefore be\r\nfully integrated into the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Vienna, which hosts four\r\nprominent international organizations in the field of\r\nglobal energy policies — the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization (UNIDO), the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organization of\r\nthe Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and\r\nIIASA — could offer, with Austria’s support, a\r\nframework for developing an innovative platform in\r\nthis regard. I look forward to exploring this issue\r\nfurther with interested partners.\r\nWith many developing regions having to cope\r\nwith the difficult and often precarious management of\r\nmountain resources, we should take advantage of the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains, 2002, for new\r\ninitiatives in exchanging experience and for new\r\nprogrammes of cooperation.\r\nFinally, we are still working on implementing our\r\nresolve to strengthen the Economic and Social Council\r\nof the United Nations for accomplishing its important\r\ntasks. The Economic and Social Council reform paper\r\nby the Secretariat’s Department of Economic and\r\nSocial Affairs contains, I think, very valuable\r\ncontributions to our ongoing debate. As Austria already\r\nsuggested years ago, coordination and integration of\r\nthe United Nations system’s reporting in economic and\r\nsocial affairs and the preparation of a comprehensive\r\n“state of the world” report by the Secretary-General\r\nwould not only facilitate but significantly enhance the\r\nrole of the Economic and Social Council in policy\r\nformulation in this field.\r\nWhen coping with the dynamic processes of\r\nglobal change in the economic sector, we have to put\r\nthe human being back into the centre of our policies.\r\nNew efforts have to be undertaken to internalize the\r\nmultiple dimensions and costs of globalization. In this\r\ncontext, let me especially welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative of a new partnership with the\r\nglobal business community, inviting it to share in the\r\nresponsibility for what is happening in the global\r\npublic space.\r\nAll the concerns I am addressing in this statement\r\nhave a common focus: understanding the human being\r\nas an actor, a perpetrator, a victim and a partner, in\r\nother words, as the basic paradigm of global\r\ndevelopment. This is why human development, human\r\nrights and human security are the points from which we\r\nhave to address both the current crises and our long-\r\nterm development objectives.\r\nMr. El-Khatib (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Let\r\nme express our deep sadness at the human loss\r\nresulting from the crash this morning of an American\r\naircraft in a Queens neighbourhood and our\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims.\r\nI wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo and his\r\nfriendly country on his election as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Let me\r\nalso pay tribute to his predecessor for his able\r\nstewardship of the last session.\r\nFurthermore, I extend warm congratulations to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his re-\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nelection for a second term of office, as well as on his\r\nwell-deserved award, jointly with the United Nations,\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize. That was an\r\nacknowledgement of Mr. Annan’s remarkable track\r\nrecord in serving the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter and a symbolic token of recognition of the\r\ncentrality and relevance of the vital role of the United\r\nNations in the world community.\r\nThis great city which hosts our world\r\nOrganization and the United States of America and its\r\npeople have been struck by a cowardly terrorist attack\r\nthat targeted innocent civilians. In truth, this act of\r\naggression was committed not just against the United\r\nStates but, in fact, against the entire international\r\ncommunity and humanity. For it seems that the larger\r\nobjective of the evil and dark forces that planned and\r\nexecuted those atrocities was the terrorization and\r\nintimidation of all of us and the precipitation of a\r\nworldwide cultural and religious confrontation. Their\r\naim was to undermine and shatter our sense of common\r\nconfidence and the bonds that unite us by stripping us\r\nof our own sense of security and driving us to deal with\r\neach other in an atmosphere of mistrust, fear and\r\nhatred.\r\nOne of the many painful impacts of those terrorist\r\nattacks is the demonstration of the depth of\r\ninterdependence in our modern life. The repercussions\r\nwent beyond the United States. The victims belonged\r\nto dozens of nations, including Jordan, and all of us\r\nalmost instantly felt the negative economic effects.\r\nThus the fight against terrorism should be\r\ncomprehensive. This means forging a unity of purpose\r\nand determination to win this war on all fronts. It also\r\nmeans exercising care and caution so that we do not\r\nfall into the trap set by the terrorists. Indeed, our war\r\nagainst terrorism is neither a religious war nor a clash\r\nbetween one civilization and another — or even\r\nbetween one nation and another.\r\nLast 11 September, Jordan reaffirmed its long-\r\nstanding and clear position, which is anchored in its\r\nfirm policy of rejecting the use of terrorism in\r\ninternational relations, irrespective of any argument\r\nadvanced, pretext invoked or label given. Thus, His\r\nMajesty King Abdullah II declared Jordan’s categorical\r\ncondemnation of the terrorist attacks perpetrated\r\nagainst the United States and Jordan’s support for the\r\ninternational effort against terrorism. In the same vein,\r\nHis Majesty expressed resolve to safeguard the sanctity\r\nof the Islamic faith from any abuse or distortion caused\r\nby terrorism or terrorists, insisting that terrorists must\r\nbe deprived of any opportunity to hijack religion and to\r\nmisuse it to serve their purposes or advance their\r\nagenda. In particular, terrorists must be barred from\r\nprovoking a confrontation between Islam and the rest\r\nof the world.\r\nThe suppression and defeat of those pernicious\r\nschemes require, among other things, the enhancement\r\nof understanding among peoples and cultures. They\r\nalso demand a genuine respect for cultural diversity.\r\nHuman pluralism should, ideally, be a force of\r\nenrichment and inspiration for the community of\r\nnations. The world is perhaps pressed now more than\r\never to launch a meaningful dialogue among\r\ncivilizations that highlights common denominators\r\nwith a view to promoting tolerance and reinforcing our\r\nability to coexist and interact in peace and harmony.\r\nThe United Nations system remains the appropriate\r\nframework and venue for such a dialogue.\r\nIslam and Muslims throughout history have\r\nenriched human civilization. The contributions of\r\nMuslim scholars in science, literature and culture in\r\ngeneral reached the heights they did due to a climate of\r\nopen-mindedness, tolerance and pluralism established\r\nby Islam.\r\nWe in Jordan take pride in the true coexistence\r\nand integration of our community life, which has been\r\nfashioned over the past 14 centuries. Muslims and\r\nChristians live side by side in national unity, where\r\nreligious pluralism is an enriching factor, making\r\nJordanian society a good example of social harmony\r\nand interaction.\r\nTerrorism will exploit political, economic and\r\nsocial imbalances and the absence of justice to advance\r\nits goals. Therefore, addressing the main causes of\r\ndespair, frustration and sense of injustice in a serious\r\nmanner is perhaps the most effective way to confront\r\nterrorism and pre-empt its potential appeal and support.\r\nWe recognize that a truly effective international\r\neffort to eradicate terrorism primarily requires, as far as\r\nthe Middle East region is concerned, a just and\r\nacceptable resolution of the question of Palestine,\r\nwhose long-running implications on the ground remain\r\nthe chief source of pain and suffering across the region.\r\nThe current situation of constant killings and\r\ndestruction as a result of Israel’s practices of using\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nforce against the Palestinian people and the siege of\r\ntheir towns and communities constitute a constant\r\nincitement that feeds escalation in a way that endangers\r\nsecurity and stability throughout the whole region.\r\nJordan firmly believes that the resolution of this\r\nconflict will not be possible by the use of force or by\r\nsecurity and coercive measures. There is really no\r\nalternative before the two sides but to return to the\r\nnegotiating table as equal partners and to seek a\r\nsettlement that ensures their legitimate rights and their\r\nfuture. This option will remain elusive until parallel\r\nmutual steps are adopted on the basis of the accords\r\nand obligations agreed upon by both the Palestinian\r\nand Israeli sides.\r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II has been engaged\r\nin enormous efforts to help the region break out of the\r\nvicious circle engulfing it because of the ongoing\r\nconfrontations between the two sides. King Abdullah\r\nhas contributed positively to the intense international\r\ncontacts and efforts to achieve that goal. Those\r\nendeavours have indeed led to the building of a full\r\ninternational consensus on the requirements needed to\r\nbreak the current deadlock. Those requirements\r\ninclude, in the first place, ending the use of the Israeli\r\nmilitary machine against the Palestinian people, lifting\r\nthe blockade imposed on them and abandoning the\r\npolicy of assassinations and incursions into areas under\r\nthe control of the Palestinian National Authority.\r\nImplementing those steps would set out an\r\nappropriate entry to start the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Mitchell Commission, the\r\nthrust of which is to create favourable conditions that\r\nallow return to the negotiating table.\r\nTen years after the Madrid Peace Conference, the\r\nregion is seething with frustration over the failure to\r\nreach the long-awaited peace. People there are no\r\nlonger satisfied by the mere existence of a peace\r\nprocess. Therefore, the revival of the peace process in\r\nitself is no longer tenable in the absence of a genuinely\r\nmeaningful effort that translates into concrete progress\r\non the road to peace.\r\nProlonged confrontations have resulted not only\r\nin the failure to carry out several obligations agreed\r\nupon, but also in retreating from undertakings that\r\nwere already in place. This demonstrates that phased\r\nand interim agreements are inadequate and ineffective\r\nto address the status quo. Therefore, starting the final\r\nstatus negotiations has become now a pressing priority\r\nin order to achieve the principal objective of the peace\r\nprocess, namely, the fulfilment of the national rights of\r\nthe Palestinian people and the establishment of their\r\nviable independent State in their homeland, as well as\r\nthe guaranteeing of the security of Israel.\r\nPeace that can be acceptable to the peoples of the\r\nregion must be comprehensive in terms of resolving, on\r\nthe one hand, the whole array of major issues: the\r\noccupied territories, Jerusalem, the refugees, security\r\nand weapons of mass destruction, and economic\r\ncooperation; and including on the other, all tracks and\r\nthe States concerned.\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973) remain the basis of the peace process. Their\r\nimplementation requires putting in place the true\r\ncomponents of peace: primarily, the renunciation of the\r\nsettlement policy which contradicts the “land for\r\npeace” principle and which is in itself a flagrant breach\r\nof international law. Peace and settlements are\r\nmutually exclusive.\r\nHoly Jerusalem is key to peace. It is an occupied\r\nPalestinian territory subject to the application of\r\nresolution 242 (1967), which aims at achieving Israeli\r\nwithdrawal therefrom and from the rest of the\r\nPalestinian territories — occupied in 1967 — so that\r\nJerusalem will become the capital of the State of\r\nPalestine. In addition, an appropriate formula will have\r\nto be worked out to ensure that the entire city of\r\nJerusalem will be open, freedom of worship for all will\r\nbe safeguarded and the city will be a factor of unity\r\nand reconciliation among all believers in God.\r\nThe issue of refugees represents the worst form of\r\ninjustice and frustration in the conflict. Justice must be\r\nsecured for the Palestinian refugees in order to\r\neliminate the greatest source of frustration and\r\nsuffering in the region. Jordan, time and again, has\r\nmade clear its firm position in relation to the question\r\nof refugees here in the Assembly. Let me emphasize\r\nthat Jordan will accept only a solution to the question\r\nof refugees that takes fully into account its rights and\r\ninterests as a State, as well as the rights and interests of\r\nits citizens, on the basis of international law and all\r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nLack of trust between the two sides precludes\r\ntheir ability to achieve any progress without an active\r\ninvolvement by a third party. Jordan welcomes\r\nPresident George W. Bush’s announcement endorsing a\r\nsolution that ensures the existence of two States,\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nincluding the establishment of a Palestinian State on\r\nthe Palestinian territory currently occupied by Israel, in\r\naccordance with relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nThis announcement completes the international\r\nconsensus on the fundamental requirement for\r\nachieving peace in the region. It is our hope that the\r\nUnited States efforts will continue with support from\r\nthe countries of the European Union, the Russian\r\nFederation and the international community as a whole\r\nin order to reach that goal.\r\nA comprehensive peace must include Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Syrian territories to the\r\nborder of 4 June 1967 and the completion of its\r\nwithdrawal from the remaining occupied Lebanese\r\nterritories on the basis of relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe suffering of Iraq and its people, due to the\r\ninternational sanctions imposed against them for more\r\nthan 11 years, is yet another source of frustration and\r\ntension in the region. Jordan once again stresses the\r\nneed to lift those sanctions and the importance of\r\ncreating conditions that will allow Iraq to reclaim its\r\nactive regional and international role. Jordan also\r\nemphasizes the importance of completing the\r\nimplementation of relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, including those relating to Kuwaiti\r\nprisoners and other missing persons.\r\nWe hope to see an end soon to the plight of the\r\npeople of Afghanistan so that that nation and its\r\npolitical forces can agree on a form of government to\r\nrepresent it. We also hope that the world community\r\nwill mount a genuine effort to assist the people of\r\nAfghanistan in facing the tragic economic conditions\r\nthat have been afflicting them for many years.\r\nAt this juncture in human history, when we are\r\nseeing a surge in global challenges, it becomes even\r\nmore imperative to rally around the United Nations and\r\nto comply more faithfully with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of its Charter, especially those relating to the\r\npeaceful resolution of disputes on the basis of\r\ninternational law.\r\nIt is also important not to abandon our collective\r\ngoals in terms of promoting peace, economic\r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights. This\r\ntrilateral platform of action represents Jordan’s\r\ndomestic and foreign agenda.\r\nOur relentless pursuit of a just peace in our region\r\nhas not disrupted our determined efforts to seek\r\neconomic, social and political development. To the\r\ncontrary, Jordan is now poised to embark on a new,\r\nintegrated enterprise that seeks more economic growth\r\nin order to improve the living conditions of its\r\npopulation and to open up new vistas of hope and\r\npromise for our future generations. Indeed, the dignity\r\nand welfare of the individual must always remain the\r\nnoblest goal of our national and international\r\nendeavours.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Manuel Inocêncio Sousa, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Cooperation and Communities of the Republic\r\nof Cape Verde.\r\nMr. Sousa (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Allow me to\r\njoin the delegations that preceded me in congratulating\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to preside over the\r\nproceedings of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, being held at an especially complicated\r\nmoment in international life. His long and brilliant\r\ncareer as an eminent diplomat and distinguished\r\nstatesman in his country assures us that his term as\r\nPresident of the Assembly will be a productive one, as\r\nhas been clearly evident since this session was\r\nconvened. I assure him that he can count on the full\r\ncooperation of the delegation of Cape Verde.\r\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\r\nI wish to express our recognition of the skill and\r\nefficiency with which he managed the major global\r\nissues that came before this lofty forum during the\r\nprevious session, particularly during the Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nMy delegation is also pleased with the re-election\r\nof Mr. Kofi Annan as Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations. The unanimity of his re-election reflects the\r\ntremendous prestige he has gained in the international\r\ncommunity because of his vision, as well as the trust\r\nplaced in him to pursue the reforms under way and to\r\nconsolidate the prestige of the United Nations.\r\nLike the delegations that preceded me, I also wish\r\nto take this opportunity to reiterate my congratulations\r\nto the United Nations and its Secretary-General as joint\r\nrecipients of the Nobel Peace Prize, an award that\r\nreinforces their moral authority, so necessary in these\r\nturbulent times. This distinction, both well-deserved\r\nand heartening, helps emphasize the importance of the\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nwork of our Organization, under the enlightened\r\nguidance of Mr. Annan, in fostering an international\r\natmosphere conducive to a more just, tolerant and\r\nmutually supportive world.\r\nThis is a gigantic and complex task, undertaken\r\nin the midst of enormous difficulties and risks and\r\ncontinually posing new challenges to our collective\r\nmind as we search for solutions to large and ever-\r\ngrowing problems that humanity must solve.\r\nNow, when international peace and security are\r\nseriously threatened, that recent honour not only\r\nconstitutes well-deserved recognition of a high degree\r\nof dedication to the cause of peace and the prevention\r\nand resolution of conflicts; it also bears a message of\r\nhope that the shining ideals of justice, democracy,\r\nhuman rights and development for all will shape the\r\nentire world to the benefit of future generations.\r\nWe in our country understand and properly\r\nappreciate the role and the importance of the United\r\nNations. It was partly due to the persistent and\r\nunconditional support of the United Nations that our\r\nstruggle for national liberation culminated in success,\r\nwith the proclamation of our independence. It was\r\ncertainly due to the support of the United Nations and\r\nits specialized agencies that Cape Verde has been able\r\nto take important steps on the road to development and\r\nshow encouraging signs of progress, year after year, as\r\ndocumented in the Human Development Reports of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\r\nThe tragedy that recently struck the homeland of\r\nthe United States of America, causing the loss of\r\nthousands of innocent lives and destroying one of the\r\nmost prestigious landmarks in this city, can only be the\r\nobject of our most vehement and total condemnation.\r\nThe United States is home to the largest overseas\r\nCape Verdean community. That part of our diaspora has\r\nalso felt violated by the barbarous attacks of 11\r\nSeptember, and along with them, my country and,\r\nindeed, all Cape Verdeans share in the mourning and\r\nthe distress experienced by the American people and\r\nfamilies of so many other nationalities.\r\nCape Verde has stood ready from the outset to\r\nsupport actions intended to combat terrorism, in the\r\ncontext of a broad international coalition under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations. Therefore, my\r\nGovernment is committed to implementing Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) to combat this scourge.\r\nImportant steps have already been taken, particularly\r\nregarding the endorsement of international anti-\r\nterrorism instruments.\r\nWe believe that all States have a moral and\r\ncollective obligation to fight the perversion of the\r\nhuman spirit represented by this phenomenon. The\r\nseriousness and the scope of the 11 September terrorist\r\nacts show that, from now on, terrorism must be\r\nconfronted resolutely, with appropriate responses and\r\npreventive action, in order to stem the criminal\r\nviolence that masquerades as being prompted by\r\npolitical or religious motivations.\r\nNo country is safe from similar attacks or from\r\nattempts to use its own territory for the perpetration of\r\nterrorist acts. Therefore, any strategy designed to\r\npermanently eliminate this dangerous threat to\r\ninternational peace and stability must be a common\r\none, with broad participation, in which the United\r\nNations plays a crucial role.\r\nIn participating in the global effort to eliminate\r\nterrorism, the developing countries are, once again, at a\r\nserious disadvantage. On the one hand, their scarcity of\r\nresources and their lack of sophisticated means of\r\ndetection and prevention make them more vulnerable\r\nto infiltration by terrorist organizations and to actions\r\nlaunched within their own borders. On the other hand,\r\nwhen they attempt to respond to demands from the\r\ninternational community, they are forced to mobilize\r\nresources that would otherwise be dedicated to their\r\neconomic and social development and to meeting the\r\nbasic needs of their peoples.\r\nAdded to this is the fact that, as was emphasized\r\nsome days ago by the Secretary-General, the poorer\r\neconomies are the ones that will pay most dearly for\r\nthe direct consequences of the terrorist attacks on the\r\nworld economy. My own country, which depends\r\nheavily on tourism revenues, is already feeling the\r\nrepercussions of the worldwide crisis in the\r\ntransportation and hospitality industries.\r\nThere is therefore a critical need for the\r\ninternational community to effectively help the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\r\namong them, to bear the added burden that the battle\r\nagainst terrorism is placing on their economies. The\r\nindustrialized countries must display increased\r\nsolidarity and generosity in assisting developing\r\ncountries, since the effort that developing countries\r\nhave agreed to make and the sacrifices imposed on\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\ntheir populations will also benefit the industrialized\r\nnations.\r\nA little more than a year ago, the Millennium\r\nSummit was held in this Hall. It drew approximately\r\n150 heads of State or Government. The dialogue was\r\nactive and innovative to an extent unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of the Organization. A tremendous variety of\r\nsectors of civil society participated directly. Not only\r\ndid the Summit provide a succinct overview of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations since its founding, it\r\nalso constituted a unique opportunity to present an\r\nintegrated picture of the strategic objectives for the\r\ntwenty-first century, thereby opening new avenues for\r\naddressing the challenges of globalization.\r\nThe conclusions of the Summit rekindled the\r\nflame of hope among the peoples of the world, in\r\nparticular among those who believe that it is possible\r\nto find effective ways of giving all countries real\r\nopportunities for development by improving their\r\ninstitutional and productive infrastructure and by\r\ncreating an international atmosphere conducive to\r\nproviding them with access to the means, both public\r\nand private, to fund their development. The drafting of\r\nthe road map towards the implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration (A/56/326) gives the\r\ninternational community a powerful tool for joining\r\nforces in the implementation of the major policy lines\r\nadopted at the Summit.\r\nImportant events have taken place since the\r\nMillennium Summit. Of particular interest were the\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on HIV/AIDS and the Durban\r\nWorld Conference Against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.\r\nNow, we are preparing to hold, in the near future, the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, a special Assembly session on children,\r\nand the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe specific manner in which those issues affect\r\nthe African continent, which is home to the great\r\nmajority of the least developed countries, has certainly\r\nhelped accelerate the decision-making processes with\r\nregard to regional integration, leading to important\r\nsteps that may open the way to a more promising\r\nfuture, despite the clouds hanging over the\r\ninternational scene.\r\nAs we know, a complicated combination of\r\nendogenous and exogenous phenomena has left the\r\nAfrican continent feeling increasingly marginalized.\r\nThe pace of economic growth has not been able to\r\nreduce poverty significantly. Diseases such as malaria\r\nand AIDS continue to cut lives short at a frightening\r\nrate. Several countries are the scene of instability;\r\nmany of them are engaged in armed conflicts and are\r\nexperiencing terrorist activities that kill thousands of\r\ninnocents, systematically destroy property, disrupt the\r\noperations of Governments and displace population\r\ngroups. The scanty positive results from the many\r\nplans and initiatives conceived and implemented to\r\ndeal with the serious problems Africa has faced over\r\nthe years have resulted in well known and widespread\r\ndissatisfaction, both in the international community\r\nand among African leaders.\r\nYet, despite the rather discouraging international\r\nclimate, Africa has taken important steps that may open\r\nthe way to a more promising future. With a view to\r\ncreating the instruments and mobilizing the will to face\r\nup to an increasingly complex global situation, African\r\nleaders proclaimed the African Union with a new\r\nvision for our continent. Moreover, they adopted the\r\nNew Initiative for Africa, recently designated as the\r\nNew Partnership for the Development of Africa, under\r\nwhich Africans assume full responsibility for\r\neradicating poverty and putting their countries on the\r\npath of economic growth and development at the same\r\ntime as they offer a partnership that is mutually\r\nbeneficial to the international community in meeting\r\nthe challenges of the new millennium.\r\nThe adoption of those two instruments and the\r\nfirm commitment to promote transparent stewardship\r\nwill surely open up new prospects for the establishment\r\nof peace, stability, democracy and development that\r\ncan lead the continent to occupy the prominent place in\r\nthe global economy that is justified by its immense\r\npotential.\r\nDoubtless, there is a long road to travel before we\r\nachieve political integration based on democratic\r\ninstitutions and grounded in popular participation,\r\ngood governance and action aimed at the promotion of\r\nsustainable development on the economic, social and\r\ncultural levels. But we believe that, with the emergence\r\nof new leadership dedicated to economic rebirth, with\r\nthe consolidation of democracy and good governance\r\nand with the anticipated support of the international\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\ncommunity, conditions will be present for a\r\nfundamental and historic turnaround in Africa.\r\nTwo of the most critical problems faced by the\r\nOrganization and by the African continent, whose\r\nsolution cannot be postponed, now loom larger because\r\nof their interconnection and because of their bottleneck\r\neffect. I refer to poverty and armed conflicts. All\r\navailable data reinforce our apprehensions about the\r\nsuccess of the battle against poverty in the world. This\r\nmakes it necessary to adopt a strategy to win that war,\r\nsince attaining the objective of a 50 per cent reduction\r\nin the number of persons living in extreme poverty by\r\n2015 appears ever more problematic. Without measures\r\nthat can effectively reverse the process of socio-\r\neconomic degradation and, especially, without political\r\nwill on the part of the international community as a\r\nwhole, that goal of the Millennium Summit cannot be\r\nachieved.\r\nIt is an undisputed fact that, as a rule, conflicts\r\noccur in countries that are marked by poverty. This\r\ncause-and-effect relationship has become a vicious\r\ncircle that cannot be terminated without efficient\r\ncoordination between the preventive diplomacy and\r\nsocial action of the United Nations on the one hand and\r\nmore effective engagement by the industrialized\r\ncountries on the other.\r\nDespite the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity, the United Nations and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral towards peace and stabilization in international\r\nrelations and towards democracy and human rights,\r\ncertain regions of the world continue to be the scene of\r\narmed conflicts that threaten to spread and endanger\r\npeace and stability in those regions.\r\nThe terrorist acts of 11 September have added a\r\nnew measure of instability, provoking an anti-terrorist\r\nmilitary intervention in Afghanistan whose duration\r\nand consequences are difficult to assess.\r\nThe impasse in the search for a lasting solution to\r\nthe Palestine question, which is primarily a result of\r\nthe intransigence of Israel and the cycle of violence\r\nthat has been set in motion, has created one of the most\r\ndangerous focal points of tension and a threat to world\r\npeace. The implementation of the Oslo Agreement\r\nmust be resumed. Violence must be brought to an end\r\nand the internationally recognized rights of the\r\nPalestinians must be respected, including their right to\r\ntheir own State, while guaranteeing the Israeli people\r\nthe right to live in peace in their country within\r\ninternationally recognized borders.\r\nAfrica, today the scene of the greatest number of\r\narmed conflicts, has taken some positive steps in the\r\ndirection of peace, with the active involvement of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Organization of African Unity,\r\nmany friendly countries and a number of multilateral\r\nactors, non-governmental organizations and elements\r\nof civil society. However the persistence of acts of\r\nviolence, namely the perpetration of criminal acts\r\nagainst civilian targets, bears evidence that the road to\r\npolitical and social stabilization leading in turn to the\r\nrestoration of peace is still long and difficult.\r\nIn Angola, for example, we have seen fresh\r\noutbreaks of armed action by UNITA, which continues\r\nto spread death and destruction. The Security Council\r\nonce again strongly condemned the actions of the rebel\r\nmovement, while maintaining its sanctions against that\r\norganization. But it is vital that all countries cooperate\r\nwithout reservation by denying UNITA the means to\r\ncarry out its criminal actions, so that it can be\r\npersuaded to lay down its weapons and fully abide by\r\nthe Lusaka Agreement.\r\nCape Verde is pleased at the success represented\r\nby the transition of East Timor towards independence,\r\na process that constitutes a remarkable and exemplary\r\nsuccess achieved by our Organization and particularly\r\nby the United Nations Transitional Administration in\r\nEast Timor. From the very outset and in the most\r\ndifficult moments, the Cape Verdean Government and\r\npeople have always been on the side of the people of\r\nEast Timor in their struggle for independence. We will\r\ncelebrate this occasion together on 20 May 2002, when\r\nEast Timor takes its destiny into its own hands and\r\njoins our great family here in the United Nations.\r\nI conclude by expressing the hope that the\r\noutcome of this session may make an effective\r\ncontribution to a better world, a more just and mutually\r\nsupportive world of peace and cooperation and,\r\nespecially, a world of tolerance and concord.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Modibo Sidibe, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Mali.\r\nMr. Sidibe (Mali) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express our condolences to the\r\nGovernments of the United States and the Dominican\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nRepublic, and to the families of the victims of this\r\nmorning’s tragic plane crash.\r\nI express my warmest congratulations to Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo on his election as President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I wish to assure him\r\nof my delegation’s complete support in the exercise of\r\nhis difficult and lofty mission. I am convinced that,\r\nwith his experience and talents as a seasoned diplomat,\r\nhe will guide our discussions to success. To his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, I would like to express\r\nmy sincerest and warmest congratulations on the\r\ncompetence, dedication, effectiveness and authority\r\nthat he displayed throughout his term of office, which\r\nwas so rich in important events for the life of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nMr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to the post of\r\nSecretary-General of our Organization, and I would\r\nlike once again to express to him Mali’s deepest\r\nappreciation for his steadfast efforts and his\r\ndetermination in the quest for a better world in the face\r\nof the many and complex challenges of the world of\r\ntoday. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the\r\nUnited Nations and to Mr. Annan reflects the work\r\naccomplished by the Secretary-General over the past\r\nfive years and is a source of legitimate pride to me as\r\nan African.\r\nOur fifty-sixth session is of particular importance,\r\nbeing held as it is in the aftermath of the brutal terrorist\r\nattacks that plunged the American nation into\r\nmourning on 11 September 2001. The Government of\r\nMali has firmly condemned these heinous acts and\r\nexpressed its solidarity with the American people and\r\nits support for the fight against terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations. Mali has already taken the\r\nmeasures necessary for the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), inter alia, through the\r\nestablishment of an inter-ministerial committee in\r\ncharge of implementing and coordinating international\r\nmeasures. We have also undertaken to ratify various\r\nconventions against terrorism in order to complete the\r\nvital legal arsenal that we need to make a complete\r\ncontribution to the collective international efforts under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations, and also to regional\r\nactions. In this respect, in addition to the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference Convention on Combating\r\nInternational Terrorism, we appeal for the entry into\r\nforce of the important Organization of African Unity\r\nConvention on the Prevention and Combating of\r\nTerrorism, adopted at Algiers in July 1999. We also\r\ncall for an effective partnership with Africa to\r\nstrengthen its capacity to combat terrorism.\r\nThe terrorist acts of 11 September, incompatible\r\nwith the lofty and tolerant message of Islam, have\r\nclearly shown the vulnerability of our current\r\ninternational system and have emphasized the need for\r\nincreased international cooperation in order to deal\r\nwith this situation. This is why the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 call for the action now being taken\r\nagainst terrorism, but they also mean that we must in\r\nthe medium and long term reflect on the further ways\r\nof combating terrorism that we must devise. But above\r\nall, these events mean that we must endeavour\r\nvigorously to implement the Millennium Declaration\r\nprogramme of action in order to ensure prosperity for\r\nthe largest possible number of people.\r\nIn this context, Mali advocates integrated,\r\nsustained global action in which the United Nations\r\nshould play the primary role. While reiterating Africa’s\r\nappeal for the holding of an international conference on\r\nterrorism, under the auspices of the United Nations,\r\nMali intends to support the initiatives of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and of his Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi, whom we congratulate on his appointment.\r\nDeeply concerned by the humanitarian situation in\r\nAfghanistan, we call for increased and coordinated\r\nemergency humanitarian assistance for the Afghan\r\npeople.\r\nThe maintenance of peace and security requires\r\nstrict control of weapons. Mali will actively and\r\nresolutely continue to support international and\r\nregional efforts in the field of disarmament and the\r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction. The question of small\r\narms, as we see it, is another source of concern. In fact,\r\nsmall arms contribute to the breakdown of the social\r\nbalance, fuel conflicts and destabilize States, thus\r\njeopardizing all development efforts.\r\nMali, which hosted the African preparatory\r\nconference, will work towards the success of a follow-\r\nup to the conclusions of the United Nations Conference\r\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\r\nin All Its Aspects and towards the full implementation\r\nof the Programme of Action resulting from that\r\nimportant Conference. The West African experience in\r\nthis respect constitutes an important initiative to be\r\nsupported through the declaration of an Economic\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS)\r\nmoratorium on the importation, exportation and\r\nmanufacture of small arms and light weapons and the\r\nProgramme for Coordination and Assistance for\r\nSecurity and Development in Africa.\r\nThe West African subregion remains\r\ncharacterized by the persistence of conflict, a high\r\nlevel of poverty, illicit trade in weapons and the\r\nproliferation of armed bands. In order to deal with\r\nthese conflicts, ECOWAS has given priority to a\r\nregional approach for the prevention and management\r\nof conflicts in order to deal with the root causes of\r\nconflict and its humanitarian consequences. The\r\nECOWAS protocol on the Mechanism for Conflict\r\nPrevention, Management, Resolution, Peacekeeping\r\nand Security, adopted in 1999, is a major tool for\r\nregional prevention and management of conflicts. Its\r\ninnovations include its Mediation and Security\r\nCouncil, its early warning system and the fact that it is\r\nrooted in the consolidation and protection of\r\ndemocracy and human rights.\r\nMali welcomes and encourages the positive\r\ndevelopments in the peace process in Sierra Leone that\r\nhave taken place since the second meeting of the\r\nCommittee of Six of the ECOWAS Mediation and\r\nSecurity Council with the United Nations, the\r\nGovernment of Sierra Leone and the Revolutionary\r\nUnited Front (RUF) on 2 May 2001 in Abuja, Nigeria.\r\nProgress, although still fragile, has been made in\r\nthe Mano River Union region. As evidence of this we\r\ncan cite the ministerial meetings among the three\r\ncountries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. ECOWAS\r\nintends to continue its efforts to help make the Mano\r\nRiver Union a pillar of stability and development. The\r\nrecent summit of heads of State and Government of\r\nECOWAS on a global and comprehensive approach to\r\nsecurity questions stresses once again the will of West\r\nAfrica to shoulder its responsibilities, helped by its\r\nvarious partners.\r\nThe implementation of these initiatives and West\r\nAfrican approaches to conflict prevention and\r\nmanagement will require assistance from the\r\ninternational community, in particular the United\r\nNations. In this respect, it is gratifying to note that a\r\ngenuine partnership has been established between the\r\nUnited Nations and ECOWAS. We firmly encourage\r\nthe establishment of the United Nations Office for West\r\nAfrica, as recommended by the inter-institutional\r\nmission that visited the region from 6 to 27 March\r\n2001.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly on\r\nchildren will be an opportunity to build a progressive\r\nand universalist vision in order to promote a “world\r\nworthy of children”, with the participation of all,\r\nwithin the framework of a world movement for\r\nchildren. ECOWAS, which has prepared for that\r\ngathering, is continuing its efforts to implement the\r\nAccra plan of action on the situation of children in\r\nconflict with the opening of a special office entrusted\r\nwith this question, the Optional Protocol that will soon\r\nbe adopted on the sale of children and the regional\r\ninitiative on joint vaccination days. In the near future, a\r\ndecade for the culture of children’s rights will be\r\nexamined.\r\nThe creation of the International Criminal Court\r\nwill not only make it possible to bring to trial the\r\nperpetrators of the gravest crimes against the dignity of\r\nthe human person, but will also be an instrument of\r\ndeterrence, which can thus contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In this\r\nregard, I recall that Mali has already ratified the Rome\r\nStatute, thus expressing its support for the struggle\r\nagainst impunity and for the full respect of human\r\ndignity. We appeal to others to help make the court a\r\nreality as early as next year.\r\nIn the field of human security, we must provide\r\nan appropriate response — a global and urgent\r\nresponse — to the scourge of HIV/AIDS following the\r\nspecial session of June 2001, while at the same time\r\nincreasing our potential to fight malaria.\r\nOur responsibility is great indeed with regard to\r\nthe persistence of inequalities and the increase in\r\npoverty. The peoples of the world aspire to education,\r\nemployment, health and nutritional self-sufficiency —\r\nin other words, they hope to attain more dignified and\r\nhumane living conditions. In this context, Africa,\r\nwhich intends to make its union a reality, wants to\r\nbecome master of its own destiny. It needs solidarity to\r\nhelp it strengthen its capacities and mobilize its own\r\ndevelopment resources. We will work hard toward the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action of the\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, held in Brussels in May 2001. As\r\nwas stated by President Konare, that Conference, by\r\nthe very fact that it was being convened, signalled\r\nprogress\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\n“... and it is also a test of the international\r\ncommunity following the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. There will be success only if we see\r\na will to move to concrete action, if we envisage\r\nstronger and bolder measures to finance\r\ndevelopment, to increase the effectiveness of\r\nforeign aid and to resolve the problems that are\r\nhampering the sustainable development of the\r\nleast developed countries.”\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, which will be held in Monterrey in\r\nMarch 2002, should be an important event and an\r\ninterface for dialogue to find new means of\r\ncontributing to the financing of development and to\r\nreaffirm the political will for concrete development\r\nobjectives. This is why Mali believes that the\r\nConference will have to lead to the adoption of a\r\nconcise political declaration — a declaration with\r\nprecise strategic objectives reflecting the collective\r\nwill to act to resolve the problem of financing\r\ndevelopment and to lay the foundations for a real world\r\npartnership.\r\nAfrica is pleased that the high-level debate of the\r\n2001 substantive session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil (ECOSOC), which was held in Geneva in July,\r\nhad as its theme “The role of the United Nations\r\nsystem in supporting the efforts of African countries to\r\nachieve sustainable development”, and awaits the\r\nrealization of the measures envisaged there. This role\r\nmust not be merely a declared one — it must lead to\r\nconcrete results. This is why we hope that the\r\nMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO), which is now under way in Doha, Qatar, will\r\npromote new progress and decisive initiatives to make\r\nit possible for Africa to develop its assets.\r\nThe entry into force of the African Union, whose\r\nconstituent act was signed in Lomé on 12 July 2000,\r\nreflects the commitment of African leaders to the\r\nintegration of our continent. In fact, the establishment\r\nof the African Union and the launching of the New\r\nPartnership for African Development, aimed at\r\neliminating poverty through sustainable development,\r\ncan help support the dynamics of regional integration.\r\nIn this respect, we appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to assist this African initiative, which is so\r\npromising for the future of the peoples of our\r\ncontinent.\r\nOur Organization is, more than ever before,\r\ncalled to act to promote international peace and\r\nsecurity and to achieve development for all. Here in the\r\nUnited Nations, we must act as full-fledged Member\r\nStates, shapers of our shared future. We say this in\r\norder to recall our shared responsibility to bring about\r\npeace in the Middle East, the Balkans and the Great\r\nLakes region — to mention just these cases — and to\r\ndo justice to human nature. We share responsibility to\r\nmanifest more solidarity and to provide assistance to\r\nresolve the many humanitarian crises that exist.\r\nIn the Middle East, the situation remains of\r\nconcern because of the persistence of violence in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories. Mali firmly condemns\r\nthe violence that has been suffered by the Palestinian\r\npeople, and we believe that Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), the principle of\r\nland for peace and the other relevant resolutions of the\r\nUnited Nations must serve as a basis for negotiations\r\nand the establishment of a just, global and lasting\r\npeace. We call for the resumption of these negotiations\r\nand reaffirm our unfailing attachment to the legitimate\r\nrights of the fraternal Palestinian people, including the\r\nright to the establishment of an independent State.\r\nMy delegation also expresses its hope that there\r\nwill be a definitive lifting of sanctions against the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula, the region from which\r\nyou come, my delegation hopes that the process of\r\nreconciliation now under way will experience further\r\nprogress, in accordance with General Assembly\r\nresolution 55/11, thanks to autonomous and\r\nstrengthened inter-Korean dialogue, and especially the\r\nholding of a second summit in the near future. In this\r\nspirit, my country will continue its action for the\r\nreconciliation and peaceful reunification of the two\r\nKoreas.\r\nAdapting the United Nations to the demands of\r\nour world is an urgent need. Mali remains convinced of\r\nthe vital necessity of democratizing the United Nations\r\nand restructuring its main organs, making them more\r\nrepresentative and credible. A democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council, whose structure no longer\r\ncorresponds to the realities of the world, will help\r\nreflect the shared will to make that organ more\r\neffective, representative and legitimate. Along these\r\nlines, we reiterate the demands of Africa for an\r\nequitable allocation of the two categories of seats, in\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\naccordance with the Harare Declaration and the\r\ndecisions adopted by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity.\r\nIn conclusion, the peoples of the United Nations\r\nare watching us as we carry out the promises contained\r\nin the Millennium Declaration. We must build a new\r\nworld — a world that reflects our intelligence, a world\r\nof justice, a world that embodies the essential values of\r\nall humanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Her Excellency\r\nMs. Aïchatou Mindaoudou, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Niger.\r\nMs. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French): The\r\nfact that we are meeting under the presidency of one of\r\nthe most eminent personalities of the Republic of\r\nKorea bears eloquent testimony to the positive changes\r\nin international relations and to the end of the\r\nideological bipolarization of the world.\r\nI would like at the outset to convey the\r\ncondolences of the Republic of the Niger to the United\r\nStates of America and the Dominican Republic for the\r\ntragedy that occurred this morning.\r\nThe Niger would like to warmly congratulate\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, as well as\r\nthe other members of the Bureau. We are sure that he\r\nwill demonstrate the same dynamism, energy and\r\nhuman qualities as his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri\r\nof Finland, as he continues his outstanding work for the\r\nbenefit of humankind.\r\nI would like to reaffirm the warm congratulations\r\nof the Niger to our brother, Mr. Kofi Annan, the\r\nSecretary-General, for his re-election to a post whose\r\nvisibility, prestige and effectiveness he has done so\r\nmuch to enhance, as well as for the award of the 2001\r\nNobel Peace Prize, which is a testimony — if further\r\nevidence were needed — to the global recognition of\r\nthe work that he has already accomplished in the\r\nservice of humanity.\r\nThis serves as an eloquent rebuttal to the\r\narguments of all those who claim to find, in the denial\r\nof the fundamental principles of dialogue between\r\ncultures and nations — principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter — the high road to salvation. In this regard, the\r\nNiger endorses the relevant General Assembly and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, and welcomes the\r\nemergence of a general consensus on the need to wage\r\nwar against terrorism on a collective and global basis,\r\nwithin the framework of the international legality\r\nembodied by the United Nations.\r\nIf we are to succeed, the fight against terrorism\r\nmust be based on a programme of international\r\ncooperation, including, in particular, substantial\r\nfinancial and technical assistance to the most\r\ndisadvantaged States so as to enable them to make a\r\nsignificant contribution to that process.\r\nStill on the subject of peace and security, I would\r\nlike to point out that, within the realm of disarmament\r\nand the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are in\r\nthe final stages of the process of ratifying the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and of\r\nsigning a safeguards agreement with the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nWith regard to conventional weapons, the\r\nconvening of the United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects fulfilled one of the commitments\r\nundertaken by our heads of State or Government in the\r\nhistoric Millennium Declaration. The Niger welcomes\r\nthe fact that the Conference was able to adopt, by\r\nconsensus, a Programme of Action to combat that\r\nscourge, which is one of the most serious threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. Furthermore, the\r\nNiger welcomes the fact that that Programme of Action\r\ntook account of the principal concerns expressed by\r\nAfrican States in the Bamako Declaration, by\r\nproviding, in particular, financial and technical\r\nassistance measures for the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants.\r\nNo part of the world has been spared the illicit\r\ntrafficking in and circulation of small arms. But the\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular those on the\r\ncontinent of Africa, are paying the highest price for the\r\nproliferation of small arms from the standpoint of their\r\nsecurity, stability and development.\r\nThat is why the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States moratorium on the manufacture, import\r\nand export of small arms, adopted in Abuja in October\r\n1998, which was extended for three years on 5 July, as\r\nwell as the Programme for Coordination and\r\nAssistance for Security and Development, should\r\nreceive substantial financial support from the\r\ninternational community.\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nIn this context, the Niger reaffirms its support for\r\nthe proposal of the United Kingdom to create an\r\ninternational fund, to be managed by the United\r\nNations Development Programme, for the collection of\r\nsmall arms. If it is effective, that fund will help to\r\nsupport regional and national projects for the collection\r\nand destruction of small arms in exchange for\r\ndevelopment projects. In this regard, I am pleased to\r\nreaffirm to the Assembly the gratitude of the Niger to\r\nthe countries that participated in the work of the Group\r\nof Interested States on Practical Disarmament\r\nMeasures.\r\nSince the events of 11 September, the entire\r\nworld has been assessing the tragic consequences of\r\nthat Manichaean ideology. Terrorists are, without\r\ndoubt, a threat to international peace and security. It\r\nhas been claimed that those events were committed in\r\nthe name of Islam. But as everyone knows, Islam is the\r\nreligion of the golden mean, and condemns suicide and\r\nmurder. It advocates dialogue and persuasion and the\r\nsteadfast combating of any tendency towards individual\r\nor collective nihilism. That is one of the reasons why\r\nthe Niger fully associates itself with the global\r\ncoalition against terrorism. That is also why, during the\r\nrecent discussions on measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism, the Niger reiterated its firm\r\ncondemnation of all forms of violence and its\r\ndetermination to commit itself to all subregional and\r\ninternational initiatives aimed at eradicating that\r\nscourge.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, world leaders\r\nundertook to enhance the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity by providing it with the necessary tools and\r\nresources to better prevent conflict, bring about the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and consolidate peace\r\nand post-conflict reconstruction. In order to be\r\neffective, a preventive conflict-management strategy,\r\nas set out in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nrequires the international community, working together\r\nwith national and regional actors, to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive approach encompassing political,\r\ndiplomatic, humanitarian and institutional measures,\r\nand to undertake actions aimed at economic\r\nrevitalization. As a follow-up to that report, last July in\r\nAgadez my country, acting within the national dynamic\r\naimed at consolidating peace and with the support of\r\nthe United Nations, organized a forum on conflict\r\nprevention — the first of its kind in Africa. That forum\r\nrecommended the elaboration of a national conflict-\r\nprevention strategy, the implementation of which\r\nwould be coordinated by the National Commission for\r\nSocial Dialogue, which brings together representatives\r\nof the State and civil society.\r\nFor too long, the international community’s\r\nattention has been focused on the Middle East, where\r\nrepeated efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement of\r\nthe Israeli-Arab conflict have ended in deadlock. The\r\nsupport of the G-8 for the idea of sending international\r\nobservers to Palestinian territory is an important step\r\nforward; such action would guarantee the impartial\r\napplication of the recommendations of the Mitchell\r\nreport.\r\nThe Niger would like to reaffirm, here in the\r\nAssembly, that a lasting settlement of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict cannot be achieved without the\r\nrealization by the Palestinian people of their\r\ninalienable right to an independent sovereign State.\r\nThe Niger wholeheartedly supports the position of the\r\nUnited States of America in this regard.\r\nWith regard to the conflict in Western Sahara, the\r\nNiger supports the efforts of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular those of the Secretary-General and his\r\nPersonal Envoy, to bring about a final settlement that is\r\nacceptable to interested and concerned parties.\r\nWith regard to Asia, the summit meeting that\r\ntook place last July in India between the President of\r\nPakistan and the Prime Minister of India raised great\r\nhopes for a political settlement of the conflict in\r\nKashmir. Such initiatives must be supported and\r\nencouraged so as to allow for the self-determination of\r\nthe Kashmiri people as soon as possible in accordance\r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nBy according highest priority to the specific\r\nneeds of Africa, the Millennium Summit recognized\r\nthe full magnitude of the serious problems that beset\r\nour continent. Proof of this is that most African States\r\nare included on the list of least advanced and poorest\r\ncountries and have been left behind by the\r\ntechnological revolution. The ravages caused by armed\r\nconflicts and the HIV/AIDS pandemic have affected\r\nmore than 26 million Africans and wiped out the hard-\r\nwon progress made over the past decade. At the same\r\ntime, the flow of official development assistance to\r\nAfrica has plummeted, while foreign direct investments\r\nhave continued to stagnate. Worse yet, between 1999\r\nand 2000 those investments even fell from $10.5\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nbillion to $9.1 billion, while during the same period\r\nthey rose in Asia and Central and Eastern Europe.\r\nIt is therefore urgent to increase the volume of\r\nofficial development assistance, to expand debt-\r\ncancellation initiatives, to improve the access of\r\nAfrican exports to international markets and to promote\r\ninvestment. These measures must be accompanied by\r\nappropriate support for the efforts of the United\r\nNations system because this Organization is the best\r\nforum for promoting new partnerships for the benefit\r\nof Africa.\r\nIn this respect, the Niger very much hopes that\r\nAfrica’s drive to reappropriate its own development\r\nwill be encouraged. That drive is marked by the\r\nproliferation of national and regional initiatives, the\r\nmost recent manifestation of which was the adoption at\r\nthe Lusaka summit of the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) of an African development plan, the\r\nimplementation of which the G-8 has decided to\r\nsupport.\r\nThe forthcoming International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development should prove to be a\r\ndecisive turning point in the establishment of a more\r\njust and equitable world economic order. It should,\r\ninter alia, lead to the adoption of a clear political\r\ndeclaration defining strategic priorities, accompanied\r\nby a precise timetable, with respect to the\r\nstrengthening of the capacities of the developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed among them,\r\nand their integration into the world economy. The\r\nConference should be the point of departure of a broad\r\nworld partnership to channel all energies towards the\r\nmobilization of resources for development and the\r\nreform of international financial structures.\r\nIn this regard, the 10-year Brussels Programme of\r\nAction for the Least Developed Countries has made it\r\npossible to lay the foundations of an enhanced world\r\npartnership to achieve the economic growth essential to\r\nreducing poverty. Following the firm commitments\r\nundertaken in Brussels, there are now grounds for hope\r\nthat, particularly with regard to trade, the current round\r\nof World Trade Organization negotiations in Qatar will\r\ntake fully into account the interests of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, whose 630 million inhabitants\r\nhave a legitimate aspiration to benefit from the positive\r\neffects of globalization.\r\nIn the absence of an appropriate response from\r\nthe affluent countries, the damage caused by the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic may prove to be irreparable, given\r\nthat some specialists estimate that there will be 100\r\nmillion dead from that disease by the year 2010 if\r\neffective measures are not taken immediately to stem\r\nthe scourge.\r\nNeed we recall, moreover, that malaria claims as\r\nmany human victims in Africa as AIDS, particularly in\r\nWest Africa? It is comforting to note, however, that the\r\ninternational community has finally become aware of\r\nthe signal danger posed by that disease. The Niger\r\nwelcomes the decision of the United Nations to\r\nproclaim the period 2001-2010 the Decade to Roll\r\nBack Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in\r\nAfrica. The United Nations is thus in step with the\r\nvarious initiatives of the OAU in the struggle against\r\nmalaria, led by Yahya Jammeh of Gambia, Olusegun\r\nObasanjo of Nigeria and Mamadou Tandja of the Niger.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the struggle against\r\nmajor diseases calls for substantial resources and a\r\nstrong capacity for coordinated action. The Niger\r\ntherefore welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\nestablishment of the Global AIDS and Health Fund,\r\nwhich should give a new dynamic to the struggle\r\nagainst AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which together\r\nclaim 5 million dead throughout the world every year.\r\nThe announcement made at the G-8 summit in\r\nGenoa that $1.8 billion will be devoted to launching\r\nthe Global Fund is an important step in the right\r\ndirection. In spite of everything, a great deal remains to\r\nbe done. According to United Nations estimates,\r\napproximately $3 billion must be mobilized before\r\n2001 for AIDS alone and contributions of $7 billion to\r\n$10 billion will be necessary every year thereafter until\r\n2005. Thus, today more than ever, the international\r\ncommunity must demonstrate active solidarity between\r\nrich and poor and a sense of unshakeable collective\r\nresponsibility — in a word, unfailing political will —\r\nif it wishes to translate into deeds the Declaration of\r\nCommitment adopted at the special session on\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe progress achieved in the Niger in its current\r\nreform programme has allowed us to re-establish and\r\nconsolidate the country’s economic bases, to revive\r\nfruitful relations with the international financial\r\ninstitutions and thus to secure the Niger’s eligibility for\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\r\nFurthermore, the Niger recently established a new\r\nframework for the implementation of its own national\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nanti-poverty policy. A strategy for reducing poverty\r\ndefines the country’s priorities and measures and\r\nactions to be undertaken in order to achieve the targets\r\nset in various spheres, which will allow us to make\r\nserious inroads into poverty by 2015.\r\nThis struggle against poverty in the Niger enjoys\r\nthe highest political involvement. A programme\r\ninitiated personally by the President of the Republic,\r\nMr. Mamadou Tandja, is designed to improve the living\r\nstandards of the people of our country. The first phase\r\nof what is known as “The Programme of the President\r\nof the Republic” has already led to the construction of\r\n1,000 wells, 100 mini-dams, 100 schools and 100\r\nhealth centres for rural communities. It is well known\r\nthat such communities in the Niger suffer intractable\r\nilliteracy, a serious lack of infrastructure and cyclical\r\nfood shortages caused by irregular rainfall. The\r\nProgramme also stresses the link between poverty and\r\nthe environment. It is in that context that we plan to\r\nplant 1 million trees throughout our national territory\r\nby the end of this year.\r\nThe Government is thus perfectly in step with the\r\ndeep-rooted aspirations of the people of the Niger, who\r\nrecognize in its actions their ancestral lore of personal\r\nand collective effort against adversity, and with its\r\nbilateral and multilateral partners, whose ongoing\r\nconcern is the restoration of the environment. All the\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations family and the\r\nEuropean Union — in particular France, Germany,\r\nItaly and Great Britain — as well as Canada and Japan,\r\nhave contributed significantly to reviving the\r\necological system and to combating desertification in\r\nthe Niger.\r\nIn the Niger, we are fully aware that this fight is\r\nprimary a national one. We wage it through\r\nvolunteerism, the roots of which are deeply entrenched\r\nin our traditions and extend beyond our frontiers. I take\r\nthis opportunity to reiterate the profound gratitude of\r\nthe Niger to all the bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem, in particular the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and our other\r\ndevelopment partners, for their precious support for the\r\nefforts of the Government to promote the well-being of\r\nour people.\r\nTo conclude, I would say that the international\r\ncommunity needs a strong United Nations to achieve\r\nthe ambitious objectives set forth in the Charter and to\r\nimplement the Millennium Declaration. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to give unstinting support to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his efforts to reform the Organization,\r\nstrengthen its role and secure the resources that will\r\nallow him to accomplish his task effectively. The\r\nUnited Nations remains indeed the only institution\r\ncapable of bringing about the new world order to which\r\nwe all so deeply aspire.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdul Aziz Bin Nasser Al-Shamsi,\r\nchairman of the delegation of the United Arab\r\nEmirates.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): At the outset, I wish to express how deeply\r\nsaddened we are over the crash of the American\r\nAirlines aircraft a few hours ago, a few miles away\r\nfrom this Headquarters, in the borough of Queens in\r\nNew York City. Let me express our deep condolences\r\nto the families of the victims and to our friends in this\r\ncountry.\r\nI have the honour to convey to Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo, on behalf of the United Arab Emirates, our sincere\r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. His\r\nelection to this high office shows the high regard the\r\ninternational community has for him personally as well\r\nas for his friendly country, South Korea, with which\r\nmy country maintains good relations. We are confident\r\nthat thanks to his experience in international affairs the\r\nAssembly will achieve positive results, and we wish\r\nhim and his staff every success.\r\nLet me also extend my thanks to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the valuable efforts he exerted in\r\nconducting the work of the previous session.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his re-\r\nelection for a second term to this high office and on\r\nbeing awarded, together with the United Nations\r\nOrganization, the Nobel Peace Prize. We would like to\r\nconvey to him our appreciation for his persistent\r\nefforts, which are bound to contribute to enabling the\r\nOrganization to accomplish its lofty mission of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security and\r\nachieving sustainable international development.\r\nThis session is being held at a very critical stage,\r\nwhen the United States of America has been subjected\r\nto the most horrific and dangerous forms of organized\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nterrorism that not only targeted the lives of thousands\r\nof innocent civilian men, women and children, but also\r\nthe moral codes and values underlying the human and\r\ncultural principles that are enshrined in the Charter, the\r\nnorms of international law and the foundations and\r\nconcepts of the legal, political, economic and social\r\ninstitutions that shape the nature of our international\r\nrelations as a whole.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates, which was deeply\r\nshocked after this reprehensible, immoral and criminal\r\nact, reiterates today its strong denunciation and\r\ncondemnation of these savage acts and all other forms\r\nof terrorism, wherever they may be. They constitute the\r\nclearest challenges to international peace and security\r\nin the twenty-first century. We also announce our\r\ncomplete support for and cooperation with the United\r\nStates Government as well as all the regional and\r\ninternational efforts aimed at tracking down the\r\nperpetrators of these brutal acts, bringing them to\r\njustice. We also stress our readiness to contribute to\r\nany international campaign aimed at eliminating\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. At the\r\nsame time, we call upon the international community to\r\nstrengthen the mechanisms and scope of relief aid for\r\nthe Afghan people, who have been afflicted by brutal\r\nwars for over two decades and who presently face the\r\nmost horrible and unprecedented internal displacement.\r\nThe changes that we are witnessing in the nature\r\nof international relations today, and the accompanying\r\naccelerated trends in the fields of globalization,\r\ntechnology, modern communications and economic\r\nopenness have not only had a positive impact on the\r\nlives and interests of certain States and peoples but\r\nhave rather contributed to widening the security,\r\neconomic, social, cultural and information gap and\r\ndifferences between the peoples of the developed and\r\nthe developing countries. At the same time, they have\r\nhelped to spawn new situations of conflict, civil and\r\nethnic wars and transnational problems. Accordingly,\r\nwe believe that the first steps to be taken to confront\r\nthe totality of these problems require, primarily,\r\nfinding a clear, comprehensive and balanced strategy of\r\nregional and international cooperation that takes into\r\nconsideration, as a matter of priority, the extent to\r\nwhich the concept of international security and peace,\r\non the one hand, and the problems of humanitarian\r\nneed and sustainable development, on the other, are\r\nlinked.\r\nIn this context, we stress the importance of the\r\nassumption by the United Nations, in cooperation and\r\ncoordination with other regional organizations, of a\r\nlarger role in international affairs. We believe in\r\ndialogue and peaceful negotiations as an ideal approach\r\nfor resolving disputes. We therefore look forward to a\r\nresponse from the Islamic Republic of Iran to the call\r\nby the United Arab Emirates to find a peaceful\r\nsettlement to the occupation of our three islands,\r\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Moussa, either\r\nthrough direct negotiations or by referring the dispute\r\nto the International Court of Justice to be resolved on\r\nthe basis of the purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nand the principles of international law.\r\nWe also hope that the visit to Tehran of His\r\nExcellency Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan,\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, on 23 July 2001,\r\nand that of Mr. Mohamed Ali Abtahi, the Iranian\r\nPresident’s envoy, to Abu Dhabi on 6 August 2001,\r\nwill contribute to the serious efforts being made to find\r\na peaceful solution to the issue of Iran’s occupation of\r\nour three islands, promote confidence-building and\r\nenhance the principle of peaceful coexistence, mutual\r\ncooperation and good-neighbourliness.\r\nFurthermore, the United Arab Emirates would\r\nlike once again to welcome the acceptance by the two\r\nfraternal States of Qatar and Bahrain of the decision of\r\nthe International Court of Justice on the settlement of\r\ntheir previous disagreement over the disputed areas. It\r\nalso notes with satisfaction the arrangements made for\r\nthe demarcation of the boundaries between some\r\ncountries of the region and stresses that continuation of\r\nsuch an approach and peaceful trends in international\r\nrelations will strengthen the foundations of regional\r\nand international peace and security.\r\nThe question of Iraq has been taken up by the\r\nUnited Nations for 11 years and the Iraqi people are\r\nstill suffering from the continuation of the international\r\neconomic sanctions imposed on them. Although the\r\noil-for-food programme has helped alleviate the\r\nsuffering of certain sectors of Iraqi society, it clearly\r\ndoes not constitute the practical mechanism required to\r\ncontain and deal with the human tragedies and far-\r\nreaching destructive effects that these sanctions\r\ncontinue to inflict, not only on the infrastructure and\r\ninstitutions of the basic services sectors of the Iraqi\r\npeople, but also with regard to people’s most\r\nelementary necessities, including nutritional, medical,\r\neducational and other care. We therefore call for a\r\n40\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\npolitical formula acceptable to all the parties concerned\r\nthat will ensure that the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi\r\npeople are lifted and, at the same time, the sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of Iraq are maintained.\r\nThe re-establishment of normal ties between Iraq\r\nand Kuwait requires efforts to resolve the problems\r\nthat have arisen as a result of Iraq’s occupation of\r\nKuwait in 1990, the most important of which is the\r\nreturn of Kuwaiti nationals and others held hostage or\r\nas prisoners of war, in accordance with international\r\nresolutions.\r\nWe welcome the Security Council resolution last\r\nSeptember to lift the international sanctions imposed\r\non our brother country Sudan. We also demand that the\r\nSecurity Council follow the same procedures in regard\r\nto the international sanctions imposed on our fraternal\r\ncountry Libya, especially now that its Government has\r\ncompletely fulfilled its commitments under the relevant\r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nSince 28 September of last year, the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories have seen human tragedies and\r\nacts of violence because of the policy of State terrorism\r\npursued by Israel against the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding re-occupation of territories, expansion of\r\nsettlements, escalation of bombing and destruction of\r\neconomic and physical infrastructure in the Palestinian\r\nterritories, in addition to systematic liquidation and\r\nmassacres that have claimed the lives of more than\r\n1,300 martyrs and tens of thousands of other innocent\r\ncasualties, half of whom are children and women.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates warmly welcomes the\r\nannouncement made by President Bush three days ago\r\nin which he committed his country to helping establish\r\npeaceful coexistence between two States, Israel and\r\nPalestine. Once again, we fully support the right of\r\nPalestinians to self-determination and to establish their\r\nown independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. In\r\naddition, we strongly condemn all flagrant violations\r\nby Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people.\r\nWe call upon the United Nations — especially the\r\nSecurity Council and its permanent members — in\r\nparticular the United States, and European Union\r\nmembers to take all necessary and effective measures\r\nto avoid bias and double standards and to bring\r\npressure to bear on Israel to end immediately all its\r\nterrorist acts of aggression against Palestinians, their\r\ntowns and holy sites. In this connection, we call for the\r\nestablishment, without delay, of an international\r\nmechanism to provide the necessary protection for the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nThe attainment of security and just and\r\ncomprehensive peace and stability in the Middle East\r\nrequires that Israel comply strictly with the agreements\r\nand protocols it has concluded within the framework of\r\nthe peace process and relevant resolutions of the\r\nUnited Nations. Those resolutions all call upon Israel\r\nto withdraw completely from all Palestinian and other\r\nArab territories it has occupied since 1967, including\r\nthe Holy City of Jerusalem, the Syrian Arab Golan and\r\nthe Shab’a farms in Lebanon. They also call for the\r\nremoval of existing settlements and the return of\r\nPalestinian refugees to their homes.\r\nIsrael’s possession of prohibited weapons,\r\nespecially nuclear weapons, is a direct threat to\r\nregional and international peace and security. We\r\ntherefore renew our call on the international\r\ncommunity to pressure the Israeli Government to\r\ndismantle its dangerous arsenal of weapons. We would\r\nalso like to emphasize that comprehensive international\r\ndisarmament, including nuclear disarmament, and\r\nimproving international mechanisms and arrangements\r\nfor non-proliferation have top priority in the area of\r\nregional and international security concerns. We also\r\ncall upon nuclear States and States that continue to\r\npursue the acquisition of such weapons to end such\r\ndangerous policies, which threaten regional and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe are following with deep concern the political\r\nand military events that have erupted in many regions,\r\nparticularly in South and South-East Asia, certain\r\nAfrican countries and the Balkans. We therefore stress\r\nthe need for the parties concerned to muster the\r\nnecessary political will and to try to resolve their\r\nproblems and disputes by resorting to dialogue and\r\npeaceful means, and on the basis of the principles of\r\ninternational law and United Nations resolutions.\r\nDespite the encouraging rates of economic\r\ngrowth and recovery achieved by some countries in the\r\nlast few years as a result of the information revolution,\r\nglobalization and the formidable technological\r\ndevelopments in the fields of communications and free\r\nmarkets, international reports and statistics have\r\nrecently indicated a slow-down in global economic\r\ngrowth due to the lack of a clear strategy for regional\r\nand international economic cooperation. That slow-\r\ndown has in turn aggravated the economic imbalance\r\n41\r\nA/56/PV.48\r\nbetween the countries of the North and those of the\r\nSouth. While the countries of the North enjoy\r\nprosperity, those of the South continue to suffer from\r\npoverty, unemployment, disease and environmental\r\npollution.\r\nTherefore the United Arab Emirates, which is\r\naccustomed to extending financial development\r\ninvestment and humanitarian assistance to many\r\ndeveloping countries and countries affected by natural\r\ndisasters and armed conflicts, calls upon developed\r\ncountries and international specialized agencies to\r\nincrease both their official and unofficial assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries. It is equally important that\r\nofficial development assistance to poor countries be\r\nincreased so as to alleviate the foreign debt burden, to\r\nhelp those countries secure access to world markets for\r\ntheir domestic products, to facilitate the transfer of\r\npeaceful technologies, and to assist them in containing\r\ntheir growing domestic problems so as to combat\r\npoverty, unemployment, environmental degradation\r\nand the spread of disease.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that our deliberations on\r\nthe items on the agenda at this session will produce\r\npositive results that will enhance confidence-building\r\nmeasures and ensure security and stability in this world\r\nof numerous and quickly changing variables.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
