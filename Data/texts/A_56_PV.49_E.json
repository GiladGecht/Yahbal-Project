(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Rexhep Meidani, President of the\r\nRepublic of Albania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Albania.\r\nMr. Rexhep Meidani, President of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Rexhep Meidani, President\r\nof the Republic of Albania, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Meidani (spoke in French): This\r\nyears session of the General Assembly is marked by\r\nprofound sadness over the innocent victims of the\r\nmacabre acts perpetrated by terrorists two months ago\r\nhere in the United States of America, and now also by\r\nthe events of this morning. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Albania, I would like to\r\nexpress our utter indignation and our strongest and\r\ncategorical condemnation of those acts, which were\r\naimed not at a single country but, rather, were a serious\r\nattack on the values of democracy, freedom and world\r\ncivilization. At the same time, I would like to convey\r\nour deepest sympathy to the American people and to all\r\nthe families that lost loved ones in those tragic events.\r\nInternational terrorism is today becoming one of\r\nthe greatest challenges for the world in which we live.\r\nIt is essential that the international community tackle\r\nthis phenomenon with the greatest seriousness, for it is\r\nreplete with catastrophic consequences in many areas.\r\nAlbania considers the military actions of the anti-\r\nterrorism coalition led by the United States and Great\r\nBritain against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and\r\nthe Al Qaeda terrorist group, under the leadership of\r\nbin Laden, to be just and in full conformity with\r\nChapter VII of the Charter and Security Council\r\nresolutions. Taking that into account, and as a country\r\nthat defends the values of liberty and democracy,\r\nAlbania expressed its determination to be part of that\r\ncoalition from the outset.\r\nThe international action that has just begun\r\nagainst terrorism should not be seen as a clash between\r\ncivilizations. On the contrary, we Albanians see it as a\r\nstruggle between good and evil and as a confrontation\r\nin which the values of humanism and peace are set\r\nagainst obscurantism and the negation of values. The\r\nonly way to win this war is for all of our countries to\r\nunite their forces to create a common front, to take\r\nincreasingly Draconian preventive measures at the\r\nnational level, and to deploy ways and means for\r\ncooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels to\r\nblock any individual terrorist or terrorist group that\r\nthreatens international peace and security. For its part,\r\nwith the mechanisms at its disposal, the United Nations\r\ncould and should do more to coordinate those efforts.\r\nAlbania welcomes the measures taken by the\r\nUnited Nations to respond to acts of terrorism. We\r\nstrongly support Security Council resolution 1373\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\n(2001) and call on all Member States to fulfil their\r\nobligations under the resolution. We also support the\r\ncurrent efforts aimed at completing the United Nations\r\nlegal framework for coordination and for the\r\ninternational communitys efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nFor its part, Albania is already a party to eight major\r\ninternational conventions on the struggle against\r\nterrorism. We shall soon adhere to six more\r\nconventions.\r\nThe new Albanian Governments four-year\r\nprogramme has set very clear objectives to definitively\r\ntake the country out of its long transition stage and\r\nplace it on the path towards stable economic\r\ndevelopment, the consolidation of its democratic\r\ninstitutions and legal framework, and integration into\r\nthe European family. Thanks to sustained efforts,\r\nAlbania has already established an encouraging climate\r\nfor individual Albanian entrepreneurship as well as for\r\nforeign investment.\r\nMoreover, Albanian institutions will keep the\r\nstruggle against terrorism, organized crime, illegal\r\ntrafficking and corruption at the centre of their\r\nactivities. The responsible commitment of the countrys\r\nleaders to an uncompromising struggle against those\r\nphenomena, as well as their cooperation with other\r\ncountries in the region and beyond, has in most cases\r\nkept in check the activities of criminal elements who\r\nseek to exploit Albania as a transit country for various\r\ntypes of illegal trafficking.\r\nMs. Dlamini Zuma (South Africa), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAlbania believes that a mosaic of fledging\r\ndemocracies is already taking shape in the Balkans,\r\nalbeit with difficulties. Believing that domestic\r\npolitical and economic stability are intrinsically linked\r\nto regional stability, Albania has committed itself to\r\napplying a regional policy of good-neighbourliness\r\ntowards all Balkan countries, and has already given\r\nconcrete proof of that desire. One clear sign of that\r\npolicy was the re-establishment of diplomatic relations\r\nwith the Belgrade Government at the beginning of the\r\nyear. That was a logical follow-up to the democratic\r\ndevelopments begun in the Republic of Serbia that led\r\nto results that were eagerly awaited by the whole of the\r\ninternational community, namely, the fall of the\r\nMilosević regime and his dispatch to the Tribunal at\r\nThe Hague. The same fate should also befall the other\r\ncriminals who carried out the policy of genocide and\r\nethnic cleansing he planned.\r\nOn behalf of peace and stability in the region, as\r\nwell as on behalf of good-neighbourliness, Albania has\r\nadopted a realistic attitude, even with regard to the\r\nmost recent crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia. The position we adopted was very much\r\nappreciated by the international community.\r\nThe Albanian Government welcomed the Ochrid\r\nframework Agreement between the Macedonian\r\nauthorities and the Albanian political forces, and we\r\nhope that it will soon be implemented in a\r\ncomprehensive manner, as this would contribute to\r\npeace and stability in Macedonia and in the region. We\r\nalso warmly welcome the indispensable role of, and the\r\nefforts made by, international mediators, which led to\r\nthe signing of the Agreement, as well as the\r\ncommitment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) to ensure its\r\nimplementation on the ground.\r\nThe Albanian State has good relations of\r\ncooperation with Kosovo, and we greatly appreciate the\r\npositive developments that have taken place there. The\r\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\r\nKosovo, and Mr. Haekkerup personally, have taken a\r\nnumber of very important steps in order to finalize the\r\nlegal framework for Kosovo and to organize the\r\ngeneral elections, which will be held on 17 November.\r\nThe elections will represent an important chapter\r\nin the history of Kosovo and of the region, because this\r\nwill be the first time in their history that the people of\r\nKosovo will be electing, in a free and democratic\r\nmanner, democratic Government bodies that will take\r\ncharge of the future of Kosovo. We would like to\r\nexpress our sincere hope that the Serb minority and the\r\nother minorities living in Kosovo will participate in\r\nthese elections, because we consider them to be an\r\nintegral part of Kosovar society.\r\nAlthough I do not wish to speak at great length\r\nabout the many problems that are facing Kosovo, I\r\nwould simply like to appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to actively seek a solution to the issue of\r\ndivided Mitrovica. Practices aimed at averting inter-\r\nethnic conflict in Kosovo such as compromises in the\r\narea of territorial compensation based on the concept of\r\nparcelling out its territory, and the establishment of\r\nparallel institutions, are harmful and should be\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ndeplored. They will not benefit Kosovo. They will\r\nsimply give rise to a fresh surge of the inter-ethnic\r\nhatred that was fuelled by Milosevic. The international\r\ncommunity and the active political forces in Kosovo\r\nmust make every effort to build a new and open society\r\nthat respects ethnic, religious and cultural diversity.\r\nAlbania has established good relations of\r\ncooperation with the countries in the region, both\r\nbilaterally and multilaterally. It has endeavoured to\r\nplay its part in contributing to peace and stability in the\r\nBalkans, including through the framework of the\r\nSoutheast Europe Cooperation Process, whose\r\nchairmanship Albania currently holds. In the\r\nframework of this initiative, Albania will play an even\r\nmore active role in coordinating the efforts of member\r\nStates with a view to strengthening multilateral\r\ncooperation in all areas, in order to overcome the crises\r\nand problems of the region.\r\nThe Albanian Government will continue with this\r\ncommitment over the next four years. It will work also\r\nwithin the framework of other regional initiatives,\r\nwhere one of our important commitments is to\r\nimplement joint infrastructure projects in the\r\nframework of the Stability Pact for South-eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nLike the other countries of the region, Albania\r\nhas embraced with enthusiasm the process of\r\nintegration into Euro-Atlantic bodies, as its strategic\r\nobjective and principal priority is to become a member\r\nof the European Union.\r\nThe Albanian Government welcomed the decision\r\ntaken last June by the Göteborg Summit to begin in the\r\nnear future the process of negotiations for the signing\r\nof a stabilization and association agreement. The\r\nAlbanian Government hopes that these negotiations\r\nwill be concluded as soon as possible and that the\r\nagreement will be signed within the next year. We are\r\naware that this will require coordination and\r\ncooperation at all Government levels in order for us to\r\nbe able to meet the political, economic, social and\r\nother standards emanating from this process.\r\nWe are convinced that integration has to start at\r\nhome and that we will have to do more to achieve the\r\nresults required by the European Union in all areas,\r\nparticularly when it comes to progress in effecting\r\nreform, and especially in terms of consolidating our\r\nlegal system, harmonizing our legislation with the\r\nexisting body of community agreements, and the\r\ncarrying out of effective macro- and micro-economic\r\npolicies.\r\nJoining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) is one of Albanias strategic objectives.\r\nThanks to its close relationship with the Euro-Atlantic\r\nAlliance in the last few years, it is one of the nine\r\ncountries that the Alliance has designated as being\r\npotential candidates for NATO membership.\r\nToday humanity is facing both new and old\r\nthreats. Conflicts between States; inter-ethnic conflicts;\r\nterrorism and organized crime; widespread poverty and\r\nthe wide gap that exists between the poor and the rich\r\ncountries, including the digital divide; natural disasters\r\nand the drying up of energy resources; diseases such as\r\nAIDS and other epidemic illnesses, and those spread by\r\nbioterrorism, have long been the subject of study in the\r\ninternational community. Current developments\r\nthroughout the world have shown, now more than ever,\r\nthe vital importance and the crucial role of the United\r\nNations in achieving peace and security and in\r\nfostering development throughout the world.\r\nThe Millennium Summit showed yet again that it\r\nis essential for each State Member of our Organization\r\nto maintain an ongoing commitment to contribute to\r\nresolving regional and international conflicts and\r\ntensions and to address such challenges as\r\nglobalization, poverty, HIV/AIDS, drugs, and the\r\nachievement of sustainable development.\r\nBut beyond these challenges, the United Nations\r\nis facing a multitude of problems related to its reform.\r\nIt must manage its resources even better so that they\r\ncan be used as much as possible for peacekeeping and\r\nfor development projects in all of the poor countries,\r\nthe countries in transition and the developing countries.\r\nThe United Nations should also become as\r\nrepresentative a body as possible.\r\nFinally, the United Nations must devise and\r\nimplement wholeheartedly mechanisms that are not\r\nbureaucratic or complex but streamlined and effective,\r\nin order to ensure that its activities become more\r\nconcrete and bear more fruit and that its voice carries\r\nthe highest authority throughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Albania for the statement he has just made.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nMr. Rexhep Meidani, President of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Maria E. Levens, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSuriname.\r\nMrs. Levens (Suriname): My delegation cannot\r\nfind the words to convey its sadness about the plane\r\ncrash that occurred in a residential area in New York\r\nthis morning. At moments like these, silence speaks for\r\nitself. The Government and the people of Suriname\r\noffer their heartfelt condolences to the families of all\r\nthe victims. We pray that our love and friendship may\r\nbring comfort and peace to all who have been affected\r\nby this tragedy and by the horrific attacks on 11\r\nSeptember.\r\nDuring the United Nations Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations, the need for dialogue is proving\r\nto be essential throughout world. In Suriname, we have\r\nalways tried to apply the concept of dialogue.\r\nSuriname is a small country with a multi-ethnic\r\npopulation. Our ancestors came to Suriname\r\ngenerations ago from West Africa, China, India,\r\nIndonesia, Europe and the Middle East. We have been\r\nfortunate that, owing to mutual respect and\r\nunderstanding, in Suriname these groups have lived\r\ntogether and are living together peacefully. More than\r\never, we realize that this harmony should be treasured\r\nand nurtured, since we can no longer take peace and\r\nharmony for granted.\r\nOur Government plays a very important role in\r\nthis peaceful coexistence, because we have strongly\r\npromoted and actively worked for mutual respect and\r\nconsensus. We believe that for people to be actively\r\ninvolved in the development of the country, they must\r\nbe able to see themselves represented in national and\r\nlocal government. We strongly promote such consensus\r\ndemocracy in Suriname, for this power-sharing\r\narrangement has stimulated all ethnic groups to be\r\ntolerant and respectful of each others political\r\nideologies, cultures and religions. Our Government and\r\nour people firmly uphold the principle of freedom of\r\nreligion, as well as of tolerance and respect for each\r\nothers forms of cultural expression.\r\nIn the same vein, the indigenous people of\r\nSuriname live in the interior with their own cultural\r\nand religious beliefs. The needs and rights of\r\nindigenous people are dealt with at the highest level in\r\nour Government. Their views and concerns are shared\r\nwith the central Government through continuous\r\ndialogue. My Government therefore looks forward to\r\nthe first conference of the Permanent Forum on\r\nIndigenous Issues, scheduled to take place in May\r\n2002.\r\nWe know, and have experience of the fact, that\r\npeoples primordial attachments become stronger at\r\ntimes of need and despair. The grief of families from\r\nthe United States of America and other parts of the\r\nworld has been deeply felt, and all over the globe many\r\nfamilies and groups have turned to each other for\r\ncomfort. Our hearts go out to all of the victims of the\r\n11 September attacks and their families.\r\nWe cannot yet assess all the social and economic\r\neffects of those attacks. However, we have already seen\r\nthe devastating effects on the Caribbean in terms of\r\nloss of income in, for example, tourism and trade.\r\nNatural disasters have also affected our area, and my\r\ndelegation sympathizes with the people of the\r\nCaribbean, especially those of Belize and Cuba, whose\r\ncountries were recently struck by hurricanes Iris and\r\nMichelle.\r\nAs a member of the Caribbean Community, we\r\nknow that we have grave problems in the region.\r\nLimited access to global markets because of stringent\r\ntrade rules and World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nregulations have resulted in increased poverty in our\r\nregion. Suriname pleads for an institutional\r\narrangement between the United Nations and the WTO\r\nso as to allow developing countries easier access to that\r\nbody.\r\nWe have further expanded and deepened our\r\nregional ties. In this respect, we would like to express\r\nour gratitude to the countries of the western\r\nhemisphere which have offered us assistance and\r\nshown their support for including us in the various\r\nintegration movements.\r\nWe in the Caribbean enjoy a high level of\r\ndemocracy and are guided by the rule of law. Our\r\nGovernments have been actively involved in creating\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nan environment to attract foreign investors and to\r\nincrease the production of goods and services. We still\r\nneed assistance. The promises made by the developed\r\ncountries in the Millennium Declaration of 2000 have\r\nnot yielded an increase in official development\r\nassistance. We, the countries in development, need\r\nequal opportunities.\r\nIf we, as the international community, agree that\r\nhuman-centred development is at the top of our agenda,\r\nwe need to understand that we have to achieve it\r\ntogether. If our goal is to eradicate abject poverty, we\r\nmust make an effort to achieve that goal. Cutting in\r\nhalf by 2015 the number of people living on less than\r\n$l a day is one of the main goals we want to achieve\r\nfor the benefit of the truly disadvantaged.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in March 2002 in Mexico,\r\nwill give both developed and developing countries an\r\nopportunity to reach concrete agreements and make\r\narrangements for resources for development. If we do\r\nnot take the opportunity offered by that Conference to\r\nwork towards sustainable development for all people in\r\nthe world, we will miss a great chance to achieve a\r\nmore equitable distribution of global wealth.\r\nIf we do not take that opportunity, we will also\r\nmiss the chance to intensify our struggle to combat\r\ndeadly diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, which\r\naffect millions in the world. We in the Caribbean have\r\ncommitted ourselves to continue the struggle against\r\nHIV/AIDS in our region. We must not lose sight of the\r\nfact that people are still dying every day of this\r\ndisease. It is up to us, the international community, to\r\nfind solutions and improve the lives of those billions of\r\npeople who are faced with global problems such as\r\nextreme poverty, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\r\nilliteracy, as well as problems resulting from the debt\r\nburden, the refugee issue, environmental degradation\r\nand the widening gap between rich and poor.\r\nSuriname has made great efforts in gender\r\nequality, and, with the assistance of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, we have begun training\r\nprogrammes in gender sensitivity. We have women in\r\nhigh-level positions, and it gives me great pleasure to\r\ntell the Assembly that our current delegation consists\r\nmainly of women. We are pleased with this\r\ndevelopment in my country, but we still have a long\r\nway to go.\r\nOur commitment to the role of women has\r\nprompted my country to work on a draft resolution in\r\nthe Third Committee of the General Assembly on\r\nmainstreaming the situation of older women into\r\nsociety, to ensure that that part of the population will\r\nnot be marginalized further in our societies.\r\nAgeing has become a subject of increasing\r\nconcern to the international community, for it raises\r\nsignificant social and cultural questions, as well as\r\nquestions of economic stability. My Government will\r\njoin the international community and the United\r\nNations to address and support the United Nations\r\ninitiative to achieve a society for all ages. We should\r\ncome up with appropriate strategies to collectively deal\r\nwith these issues during the Second World Assembly\r\non Ageing.\r\nHuman development constitutes one of the key\r\npillars of the development policy of my Government.\r\nPeople, especially our children, are our countrys\r\ngreatest treasure. This is why looking after their well-\r\nbeing is placed high on our national agenda. Suriname\r\nis looking forward to the Special Session on Children\r\nthat has been postponed to 2002.\r\nSuriname hopes that the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development of 2002, in Johannesburg,\r\nand the assessment of the Earth Summit of June 1992,\r\nwill lead to recommendations and commitments for the\r\nimplementation of real sustainable human development\r\nin a globally sustainable environment. Protecting the\r\nenvironment is the responsibility of all countries.\r\nSuriname took a first step in conserving biodiversity\r\nfor contemporary and future generations by\r\nestablishing the largest protected nature reserve in\r\nSouth America three years ago. With this first step, we\r\nhope to encourage other countries in the world to\r\nprotect the environment, and to work together on the\r\nmany emerging global environmental threats.\r\nSuriname is extremely concerned about the trans-\r\nshipment of nuclear waste through the Caribbean Sea,\r\nbut we are pleased to see that so many countries have\r\nratified the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nThe ever-widening global digital divide that\r\nprevents developing countries from benefiting fully\r\nfrom the advancements in information technology is a\r\nconcern that we have discussed in various international\r\nforums, but it still needs much more of our attention.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nThe effects of globalization have not been\r\nfavourable to most developing countries. However, we\r\nhave come to understand and experience that our world\r\nis an interdependent one, and we cannot turn back this\r\nclock. The attacks of the 11 September have shown us\r\nhow interdependent we are. The loss of lives was\r\ndirectly felt in the United States and in more than 80\r\ncountries in the rest of the world. The economic effects\r\nare also being felt in all parts of the world.\r\nIn conclusion, the Secretary-General and the\r\nUnited Nations received the Nobel Peace Prize this\r\nyear at a time when the world was still trying to\r\ncomprehend the horrific attacks of 11 September on the\r\nUnited States. Suriname hopes that this distinguished\r\naward will encourage the United Nations to continue\r\nits important work for human rights, peace, social\r\njustice, human development, human-rights education\r\nand economic prosperity for all the peoples of the\r\nworld. We congratulate the Secretary-General on this\r\nprestigious award and his re-election. And we\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his election as President and\r\nlook forward to his guidance and leadership during the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nAs members of the United Nations family, we are\r\ncalled upon to practice tolerance and to live together in\r\npeace with one another as good neighbours. Because of\r\nthe devastating consequences of 11 September, we\r\nhave the obligation to look closely at the root causes of\r\nterrorism. The causes of terrorism have to be discussed\r\nand dealt with to protect all our peoples and interests.\r\nFor the world is our home, and we are the people who\r\nlive in it.\r\nMr. Cimoszewicz (Poland): We have just learned\r\nof the crash of an American Airlines plane in New\r\nYork. We the Polish delegation, offer our heartfelt\r\ncondolences, and express our sympathy to the\r\nGovernment of the United States and the Dominican\r\nRepublic and to the families of the victims of this\r\ntragedy.\r\nAt the outset, let me offer Mr. Han my sincere\r\ncongratulations on his election to the prestigious office\r\nof the President of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. The delegation of the Republic of Poland\r\nextends to him its firm support in his demanding\r\nmandate.\r\nLet me likewise express to the former President,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, of Finland, our appreciation for his\r\nremarkable leadership, which he brought to the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the Assembly.\r\nI should also like to convey to Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nthe distinguished Secretary-General, my sincere\r\ngreetings, and to say how pleased Poland is at his\r\nsecond term in that high post. May I also take this\r\nopportunity to renew to him, and indeed to this\r\nOrganization as a whole, my Governments\r\ncongratulations on the recent Nobel Peace Prize. The\r\naward comes as a timely token of appreciation of the\r\nway the United Nations and the Secretary-General have\r\nbeen meeting their formidable challenge.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe appalling tragedy of 11 September calls for\r\nresolute reaction of the entire international community,\r\nfor active solidarity with the United States and for\r\neffective counter-measures against those who sow\r\ndeath, hatred and terror.\r\nThe terrorist attack of 11 September, the way it\r\ncame about and the circumstances by which it was\r\nconditioned should be seized by the international\r\ncommunity as an occasion for an in-depth reassessment\r\nof the very foundations of the international order.\r\nPreoccupied as we are with ever-new developments\r\neach day, we tend to be mentally incapable of\r\nfollowing signals that predict new trends in\r\ninternational relations. We have hardly been able to\r\nafford the time for searching reflection on, and\r\nadjustment to, negative phenomena that, if ignored,\r\ncan, in time, become the breeding ground for upheavals\r\nand conflicts. In this era of enormous new challenges,\r\nit is time for creative thinking, vision and intellectual\r\ncourage.\r\nThe essence of security has changed dramatically.\r\nIn Polands view, all aspects of security need urgent,\r\nthorough and imaginative reassessment. In this context\r\nparticularly searching reflection must be focused on the\r\nrole of the State  an entity that operates in entirely\r\nnew circumstances in an era of dramatically increasing\r\nintegration, globalization and fragmentation. This is a\r\ntime of interdependence and multiculturalism, in which\r\nopenness, close international cooperation and\r\ninteraction should be seen as countermeasures against\r\ndiverse processes of fragmentation and disintegration,\r\nwhich can lead us even further towards the nationalism,\r\nseparatism, closure and isolation that loom all around.\r\nFragmentation is creating instability and conflicts. And\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nthe most dangerous fragmentation process of the\r\ncurrent era is being generated by the widening\r\ndevelopment gap between regions and States, which\r\nhas been so well attested and documented by many\r\nUnited Nations publications. In this, the role of the\r\nUnited Nations is particularly fundamental and crucial.\r\nThere is no better-equipped and more universal forum\r\nto deal with those issues.\r\nAt the Headquarters of an Organization which the\r\npeoples of the United Nations established 56 years ago\r\nin order to maintain international peace and security,\r\nthat axiom should be self-evident. The whole world is\r\ntrying to respond to the challenges of globalization, the\r\nnew scientific revolution, and  quite recently  the\r\ndestabilizing forces of terror. The United Nations\r\nshould find adequate answers to those challenges. This\r\nis a time for collective and resolute action.\r\nPerhaps as ominous as terrorism itself is the fact\r\nthat in some countries, the monstrous acts of violence\r\nthat have taken place have been met with some\r\nsympathy on the part of those who are destitute,\r\ndeprived of any hope, and who, driven to the margins\r\nof social life, have become frustrated and desperate.\r\nTerrorists must never be exculpated or their\r\nactions justified. We need to do away with the reasons\r\nwhy many perceive terrorists as present-day Robin\r\nHoods. Though such a perception can be described as\r\ngroundless, this does not release us from our\r\nresponsibility to take a careful and courageous look at\r\nthe phenomena that are emerging in the present\r\ninternational order, which tend to consolidate\r\ninequalities and lead to various social calamities.\r\nFrom the very beginning, Poland has proclaimed\r\nitself entirely on the side of the international anti-\r\nterrorist coalition. We are working seriously and\r\ndiligently on the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nRegional undertakings can make a significant\r\ncontribution to drafting a global strategy for the\r\nstruggle against terrorism. With that in mind, last week\r\nin Warsaw we organized a very successful international\r\nConference on Combating Terrorism. The Conference\r\nwas attended by representatives of 17 Central\r\nEuropean, Baltic and Balkan States, including 13\r\nPresidents. The Conference also provided a direct\r\nconnection with the White House and President Bush,\r\nwho had the opportunity to talk directly with the\r\nConferences participants. The declaration adopted by\r\nthe Conference indicates a strong political commitment\r\nto fight against that plague at the dawn of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, in close collaboration with the United\r\nStates and the entire international community.\r\nThe plan of action adopted at that Conference\r\nspells out concrete measures. It is significant that the\r\nleaders of that region of Europe gave unanimous\r\nbacking to the relevant actions of the United Nations,\r\nthe European Union and other organizations.\r\nIn the course of Polands very complicated\r\nhistory, my nation has on several occasions been\r\nbetrayed by disloyal neighbours and allies and has paid\r\nthe highest price for this. Therefore we understand\r\nbetter than anyone how priceless and crucial true\r\nloyalty and alliances are. Thus we will continue to\r\nsupport our friends and allies by all available means.\r\nOur principal goal at present is to ease peoples fears -\r\nfears that have been imposed on them by the enemies\r\nof mankind.\r\nThe horrible scenario in which public order and\r\nthe safety of peoples is threatened, passenger planes\r\nhijacked and destroyed, deadly viruses spread and\r\nwater poisoned must not be repeated. We must defeat\r\nthose who participate in, or contribute to creating, such\r\na threat. Our approach must be a comprehensive one.\r\nLet me make it clear: there is no room for any\r\nselectivity, flexibility or relativism when the most\r\nfundamental values of humankind are openly and\r\nfuriously attacked.\r\nHowever, we need to reconsider our position on\r\nhow to respond to the needs of those millions who\r\nevery day suffer from hunger, disease and a lack of\r\nclean water. For them, the same question arises every\r\nmorning  a question that sounds like the classical\r\nphrase to be or not to be. That question is how to\r\nsurvive. Extreme poverty deprives people of their\r\ninherent dignity and human rights and of their chance\r\nfor a better tomorrow, thus pushing them to take\r\ndesperate steps.\r\nLet the tragedy of 11 September teach all of us to\r\ncollectively combat evil. Let us do everything to ensure\r\nthat the forces of darkness never prevail.\r\nIn the course of the last few years it has been\r\neloquently argued, from this very rostrum, that\r\nglobalization is a very positive force which will\r\nultimately usher in an era of prosperity and stability\r\nand a global society. Alas, this has not happened.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nThis calls for a new approach to international\r\ncooperation, for a new role on the part of multilateral\r\ninstitutions, and for the restoration of the primacy of\r\ncourageous political decisions and intergovernmental\r\naccords. This also calls, on the one hand, for greater\r\nmoderation on the part of the strong and the rich, and,\r\non the other, for more determined endeavours on the\r\npart of the weak and the poor, who must be convinced\r\nthat their consistent aspirations to improve their own\r\nlot will ultimately pay off. In my opinion, the\r\npromotion of democracy and good governance offers\r\none of the most important paths towards such a goal.\r\nPolands own experience in the past 12 years, since the\r\nhistoric transformations of 1989, testifies to the merits\r\nof that path.\r\nIt is my Governments firm view that, in the face\r\nof the threats which will forever be symbolized by the\r\natrocities of 11 September, the interests of international\r\nsecurity would be well served by the earliest possible\r\nsignature and ratification of, or adherence to, the\r\nmultilateral conventions against terrorism which have\r\nbeen elaborated under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. In particular, the spreading anthrax scare,\r\nwhich represents but the tip of the iceberg when it\r\ncomes to the potential danger of bioterrorism, and the\r\nspreading of fissile materials and chemical weapons are\r\na powerful argument for the urgent need to strengthen\r\nand strictly enforce the Biological Weapons\r\nConvention of 1972 and other legal instruments in this\r\nfield.\r\nWe should immediately move  to quote the\r\nSecretary-General  from a culture of reaction to a\r\nculture of prevention.\r\nWhile imperative, the struggle against terrorism\r\nmust not obscure the necessity for the United Nations\r\nto effectively discharge the mandate entrusted to it by\r\nthe international community  a mandate whose scope\r\nis expanding over the years. This is not only true with\r\nrespect to the international security problems which I\r\nhave just referred to, but also concerns problems\r\nrelated to socio-economic cooperation, the protection\r\nof human rights and humanitarian issues, particularly\r\nthose concerning refugees and the protection of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nAlso of major importance, in our view, is the\r\nelaboration and adoption of a package of regulations\r\nand commitments in respect of development aid,\r\nindebtedness and trade. Thus I wish to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the full implementation of the set of\r\nprinciples and practical measures embodied in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. We are mindful, of course,\r\nthat the translation of that programme into practical\r\nsteps cannot be the responsibility of the United Nations\r\nalone. It is essential for other institutions and\r\norganizations, including financial, trade and regional\r\nones, to help in that effort. Above all, individual States\r\nmust become directly involved, otherwise the smooth\r\nand timely implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration could be seriously jeopardized.\r\nThe United Nations is now facing enormous and\r\nunprecedented challenges. These challenges  arising\r\nas they do at the dawn of the new millennium - mean\r\ngrowing divisions and, indeed, pose a risk of\r\nfragmentation of the international community.\r\nMy country, Poland, is ready to be an active\r\nparticipant in the process of searching for a new role\r\nfor the United Nations. We have been active throughout\r\nthe entire history of the United Nations, and we want to\r\nbe active in the immediate future as well.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalghem,\r\nSecretary of the General Peoples Committee for\r\nForeign Liaison and International Cooperation of the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nMr. Shalghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya): At the\r\noutset, I would like to congratulate the President on his\r\nunanimous election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. His choice to\r\nassume this high post is a reflection of Member States\r\nappreciation of him personally and their confidence in\r\nhis ability to conduct the deliberations of this session\r\nin a manner that would enable it to reach conclusions\r\nthat would contribute to the strengthening of stability\r\nand the promotion of development all over the world.\r\nI would also like to seize this opportunity to\r\nexpress our gratitude and appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, President of the\r\nprevious session of the Assembly, which witnessed\r\nmany activities that have gone a long way towards\r\nresponding to the common concerns of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nOur great appreciation also goes to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, who\r\ncontinues to perform his duties with dedication and\r\nrenewed vigour, even under very difficult\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ncircumstances. His re-election to a second term at the\r\nhelm of the Organization and the fact that he was\r\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize, together with the\r\nUnited Nations, this year is testimony to the\r\nappreciation of his work and the confidence in his\r\nability to further enhance the role of the United Nations\r\nand to make it more effective in facing the challenges\r\nof the new millennium.\r\nOn 11 September, several American cities,\r\nincluding the City of New York, which hosts our\r\nOrganization, were subjected to terrorist attacks to\r\nwhich thousands of innocent people fell victim. Once\r\nagain I express to the people of the United States and\r\nthe families of the victims, who lost their loved ones,\r\nmy deepest sympathies. We in Libya, having been\r\nsubjected to various forms of terrorism, including State\r\nterrorism, realize better than others the cruelty and the\r\ndepth of feelings that the American people suffered and\r\nthe psychological impact, particularly on the families\r\nof the victims. My country has therefore condemned\r\nthose painful events, emphasizing our firm position,\r\nwhich denounces terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations and calls for the eradication of this\r\nphenomenon, which endangers the independence of\r\nStates and the lives of peoples.\r\nWe, in Libya appreciate the measures taken by\r\nthe international community to uproot terrorism,\r\nincluding the number of agreements made  the most\r\nimportant of which we are already party to, and the rest\r\nof which we are in the process of acceding to.\r\nNevertheless, it is very evident that there is an urgent\r\nneed to take other measures to confront the challenges\r\nposed by this phenomenon. This will necessitate\r\nseeking and eradicating the roots of terrorism. It is also\r\nimperative to take effective action to put an end to\r\nterrorist practices and to eliminate all the reasons and\r\nmotives that stand behind terrorism.\r\nBefore achieving this, we must agree on a\r\nuniform definition of terrorism to determine ways of\r\ncombating it. We cannot condemn terrorism and fight it\r\nwhen it hits one country and turn a blind eye when it\r\nhits other countries and peoples. It is also very\r\ndangerous to link terrorism to a certain religion or\r\nnationality, as terrorism has no nationality and no\r\nreligion. Further, it is unacceptable to label as terrorism\r\nthe struggle of peoples to protect themselves or to\r\nattain independence while ignoring real terrorism,\r\nwhich has several faces and is practised in different\r\nways.\r\nOccupation, provocation and aggression against\r\npeoples, like that against Libya in 1986, is all\r\nterrorism. The establishment of military bases on the\r\nterritories of others is terrorism. Fleets that roam the\r\nseas are stationed off the coasts of other States and\r\nviolate their territorial waters are forms of terrorism.\r\nThe downing of civilian aircraft, like the Libyan\r\naircraft that was hijacked and destroyed over Sinai in\r\n1973, is terrorism. Mass massacres are terrorism. The\r\ntraining of extreme elements in certain countries and\r\nfacilitating their arrival in other countries to carry out\r\ncriminal acts, including assassinations, as happened in\r\nmy country in 1984 and 1993, is terrorism. The\r\nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the\r\nthreat of their use is terrorism. The imposition by one\r\nState of unilateral, coercive measures against other\r\ncountries and the enactment by the same State of laws\r\nto punish others who maintain relations with these\r\ncountries is also terrorism. Exploiting the Security\r\nCouncil to impose sanctions against peoples without\r\nany justification or evidence is terrorism. Preventing\r\nthe Council from adopting measures to protect those\r\nwho are subjected to killing and displacement\r\nconstitutes support for and encouragement of terrorism.\r\nDue to these considerations, we believe it has\r\nbecome important and necessary to take international\r\naction to combat terrorism at all levels. We think that\r\nsuch action could be effective if undertaken under the\r\numbrella of the United Nations, in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of its Charter. My country was\r\namong the first to act in this context when, in 1992, we\r\ncalled on the Secretary-General of the United Nations\r\nto request the convening of a special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly devoted to the consideration of the\r\nmeans of combating terrorism.\r\nToday, we renew this call out of a conviction that\r\nthis is the best way to study the question of terrorism\r\nwith a view to arriving at an accurate definition of\r\nterrorism far removed from selfish and subjective\r\nclassifications. We are also convinced that this is the\r\nbest way to deal with this phenomenon in all its\r\npolitical, economic and social aspects and,\r\nconsequently, to take the necessary measures to fully\r\nuproot it.\r\nEvery year, we gather here to review and assess\r\nour achievements. Despite the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember, we notice that the previous year witnessed\r\na number of important developments. The General\r\nAssembly held more than one special session. Two\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nhigh-level conferences were held within the framework\r\nof the United Nations, one of which was devoted to the\r\nsituation of the least developed countries and the other,\r\nto our common struggle against racism and\r\nxenophobia. In the declarations and programmes of\r\naction resulting from these conferences, there was a\r\nrededication and commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations, aimed at maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security and developing\r\nfriendly relations among States. It was also affirmed\r\nthat more efforts would be made to implement\r\npriorities such as the promotion of development, the\r\nprovision of shelter for all, the eradication of want and\r\ndiseases, the ending of injustice and unfairness and the\r\nuprooting of discrimination in all its forms.\r\nThe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya participated in all\r\nthese forums, and we are happy to have contributed to\r\ntheir successful results. Like other Members of this\r\nOrganization, we have an interest in the establishment\r\nof peace, the realization of justice and the support of\r\nsustainable development. Notwithstanding all these\r\nachievements, it is abundantly clear that there is a need\r\nfor further efforts so that we may be able to address the\r\nadditional challenges facing all Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nOne such challenge is the environmental\r\ndegradation that threatens life on Earth, our common\r\nhome. Violence and armed conflicts also rage in\r\nseveral regions. Millions suffer from abject poverty in\r\nmany places in developing countries. Diseases,\r\nparticularly HIV/AIDS, threaten the lives of entire\r\ncommunities.\r\nThere are still those who challenge the collective\r\nwill and cling to unilaterally enacted laws, applying\r\nthem to all. Old ideological barriers have been replaced\r\nwith new barriers, including impeding access of many\r\ndeveloping countries to the technology necessary for\r\ntheir development and advancement. Moreover, our\r\nworld is still not free of criminal activity, including the\r\nillicit trade in small weapons and narcotics and\r\ntransnational organized crime.\r\nThe United Nations is the tool of our common\r\nwork in our efforts to face these challenges.\r\nUndoubtedly it has made many efforts, but it could\r\ncertainly be more effective in carrying out its duties if\r\ndrastic structural reforms were made to its organs and\r\nif new working methods were developed for its various\r\nmechanisms. Many proposals have been submitted over\r\nthe past few years in this regard, but, unfortunately,\r\nthey did not resonate with certain Powers that care only\r\nfor their narrow selfish interests. This makes it\r\nincumbent upon the other Members of this\r\nOrganization that have a real stake in reform to unify\r\ntheir efforts and capacities to effect inevitable change,\r\nif we want our Organization to succeed, consistent with\r\nthe spirit of the times, and to meet the needs of the\r\npeople.\r\nFor our part, we wish once again to reaffirm that\r\nsuch change should be aimed at achieving the\r\nfollowing.\r\nFirst, it must enhance and develop cooperation\r\namong the principal organs of the United Nations, and\r\nbetween these organs and other bodies and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations system, with a view to resolving\r\ninternational problems in all their aspects.\r\nSecondly, it must enhance the role of the General\r\nAssembly, making it more effective, so that it can carry\r\nout the functions entrusted to it by the Charter,\r\nincluding contributing to the adoption of measures to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. The\r\nAssembly should have the authority to control and to\r\nhold accountable other United Nations organs,\r\nincluding the Security Council, which should be\r\naccountable to the Assembly.\r\nThirdly, it must establish a mechanism affiliated\r\nwith the General Assembly to follow up the\r\nimplementation of Assembly resolutions. We cannot\r\nwait indefinitely for the implementation of resolutions,\r\nmost of which were adopted more than 50 years ago.\r\nFourthly, it must accelerate the introduction of\r\nradical reform to the Security Council membership in\r\norder to apply the principle of equitable geographic\r\ndistribution and thus do justice to the disadvantaged\r\nregions in Africa, Asia and Latin America that are\r\nunder-represented in the Council. Reform should also\r\napply to improving the Councils working methods to\r\nensure transparency in its work and democracy in its\r\ndecision-making.\r\nFifthly, the privileges emanating from victories of\r\nthe Second World War must be withdrawn, the most\r\nimportant being the right of veto, which has become\r\nobsolete. Therefore, there is no longer any justification\r\nfor maintaining it, not only because it contravenes the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States, but also\r\nbecause it has been used to protect aggressors from\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ncondemnation. It is also being used to prevent the\r\nadoption of measures to protect those subjected to\r\naggression, killing, displacement and other acts of\r\ngenocide.\r\nSeeking to establish peace and enhance stability\r\nis among the major purposes of the United Nations.\r\nThis Organization certainly cannot perform all these\r\nfunctions alone. Member States can establish effective\r\nmechanisms to resolve the most intractable problems.\r\nIn this context, we in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya have\r\nmade consistent efforts to assist countries suffering\r\nfrom conflicts and disputes. Talks held last June, under\r\nthe auspices of the Qadhafi Charitable Organization,\r\nbetween the Government of the Philippines and the\r\nMoro Front, led to the signature of the Tripoli Peace\r\nAgreement, ending a bitter conflict and meeting the\r\naspirations of both parties for the restoration of\r\nsecurity and stability in southern Philippines.\r\nWe have participated effectively in various\r\nnegotiations that have resulted in the settlement of the\r\nEthiopia-Eritrea dispute and the conclusion of the\r\nArusha Agreement, ending the conflict in Burundi.\r\nTogether with other African countries, we are\r\nintensifying our efforts to support reconciliation in\r\nSomalia and the restoration of peace to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo on the basis of the Lusaka\r\nAgreement, emanating from the agreement signed in\r\nthe city of Sirte in September 1999.\r\nCurrently, intensive efforts are being made to\r\nimplement the Libyan-Egyptian initiative, in\r\ncoordination with the initiative of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, to\r\nachieve broad-based national reconciliation in the\r\nSudan so that its people can live in harmony and\r\nstability, based on the unity and territorial integrity of\r\nthat sisterly country and equality among its people.\r\nWe take great pride in our contributions and\r\nachievements. But above all, Libyans from all walks of\r\nlife  men and women  greatly cherish the historic\r\nevent that took place in March of this year, when\r\nAfrican leaders announced the establishment of the\r\nAfrican Union at the second Sirte summit. This was\r\nfollowed by the thirty-seventh summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, held last July, which\r\ntook progressive practical measures to strengthen the\r\nfundamentals of this Union, which is an important\r\ntransformation in the history of Africa, realizing as it\r\ndid, the dream of the forefathers of a unified Africa. It\r\nwas the culmination of the efforts of the great African\r\nleaders whose objective has always been the unity of\r\nthe continent so that it could enhance its security and\r\nprogress and build its future. It is a new phase in an\r\nAfrican renaissance that will eliminate rifts that divide\r\nthe continent and will establish one bloc for all\r\nAfricans, capable of confronting various challenges in\r\na world of large groupings.\r\nThe fact that Africa has taken all these initiatives\r\nand steps sends a clear message to other countries of\r\nthe world that Africa fully realizes that resolving its\r\nproblems and developing its abilities is primarily the\r\nresponsibility of the Africans. Yet we must emphasize\r\nthat there will be no peace, security or stability in the\r\nworld as long as Africa suffers from problems and\r\ndisturbances. For that, the United Nations and all\r\ncountries must assist in the efforts of African countries\r\nto establish peace throughout the continent and to\r\nenhance security in all its corners. This requires\r\nprimarily support for Africas dispute-settlement\r\nmechanisms, assistance in eradicating the poverty of\r\nmillions of its people and the elimination of diseases,\r\nparticularly HIV/AIDS, which threatens the lives of\r\nmore than 30 million Africans.\r\nMoreover, a solution must be found to the\r\nproblem of external debt, which devours most of\r\nAfricas earnings. Moreover, an end must be put to\r\nconsequences of colonialism, the cause of Africas\r\nunderdevelopment and the obstacle to its progress. The\r\nonly way to do justice to the peoples of Africa is for\r\nthose States that conquered their land, looted the\r\ncontinents resources and built their progress at its\r\nexpense to apologize to the peoples of Africa for these\r\npractices and to pay them full compensation for the\r\nlosses and damages caused by colonialism.\r\nThe international community has thus far failed\r\nto resolve the Palestinian problem, which is almost as\r\nold as the United Nations itself. This is essentially due\r\nto disregard of the core of the problem, which is that a\r\nland was usurped and its people were expelled from\r\ntheir homeland. Thus, Palestine remained occupied.\r\nMost of its people became refugees in various parts of\r\nthe world, and those who stayed were made into\r\nprisoners in their own homes, deprived of the most\r\nbasic human rights. The Palestinian people are being\r\nsubjected to the most heinous crimes committed\r\nagainst any people in contemporary history. Palestinian\r\nchildren and young and elderly people are assassinated,\r\ntheir land is confiscated, their farms are burnt and their\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nhouses are demolished to be replaced by houses of\r\nsettlers who came from various parts of the world in\r\npursuit of unbelievable and illogical myths.\r\nOld and new developments of the Palestinian\r\nquestion are sufficient proof that ending the suffering\r\nof the Palestinians under occupation cannot be\r\nachieved through plans that are never implemented. It\r\nhas also been cogently proven that the problem will not\r\nbe resolved by the resolutions that the United Nations\r\nhas been reiterating for more than five decades.\r\nIn the light of those irrefutable facts, the solution\r\nthat should be sought, and on which all efforts must\r\nfocus, lies in what my country has said before and\r\nreaffirms now: the Palestinian people must return to\r\ntheir homeland, from which they were expelled, and a\r\ndemocratic, non-racist State must be established in\r\nwhich all citizens are equal irrespective of religion or\r\nethnicity, a State similar to the one that has been\r\nestablished in the Republic of South Africa. Any other\r\nsolution would be a fantasy that would serve only to\r\nperpetuate the Palestinian tragedy.\r\nSpeaking of the situation in the eastern Arab\r\nregion, my country reaffirms its unlimited support for\r\nsisterly Syria and Lebanon in their steadfastness in the\r\nface of Israeli aggression. We condemn all attempts to\r\nprovoke those countries, and we uphold their right to\r\nrecover all their territories under occupation.\r\nTurning to the current situation in Iraq, we\r\ncondemn the daily violations of Iraqi sovereignty and\r\nthe continuous aggression to which Iraq is subjected.\r\nWe call on all peace-loving countries to work towards\r\nthe lifting of the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi people\r\nand towards putting an end to all schemes aimed at\r\ndestroying their capacities and at dividing their land.\r\nTireless efforts have been made in the field of\r\ndisarmament. My country is a party to most\r\ninternational disarmament agreements and is in the\r\nprocess of acceding to the remaining ones, including\r\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\r\nand on Their Destruction and the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. But we firmly believe that\r\ngeneral and complete disarmament cannot come about\r\nwithout a change in current norms and in the approach\r\nto disarmament issues. What we see today is a growing\r\ntrend towards the control of small arms and light\r\nweapons rather than of the weapons of mass\r\ndestruction that pose a greater threat to international\r\npeace and security and to human life.\r\nThat is why we wonder about the sharp focus on\r\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction, even though it\r\naddresses only simple, limited weapons that small and\r\nweak countries need to defend their borders against\r\npowerful countries that possess aircraft carriers and\r\naeroplanes that can be refueled in the air. Why should\r\nwe not focus our efforts on the destruction of chemical\r\nand biological weapons and of ballistic missiles? Why\r\nare nuclear-weapon States not serious about practical\r\nmeasures to destroy their nuclear stockpiles? Why are\r\ncertain countries falsely accused of acquiring weapons\r\nof mass destruction while there is silence about the\r\nIsraelis, who, as everybody knows, possess hundreds of\r\nnuclear warheads and other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and conventional weapons? Moreover, Israel\r\ncontinues to defy the will of the international\r\ncommunity, which has called on it to accede to the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\r\nand to place its nuclear facilities under the safeguards\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency in order to\r\nhelp ensure that the region is free of nuclear weapons.\r\nWe want the important question of disarmament\r\nto be dealt with in a comprehensive and non-selective\r\nmanner. Efforts should be concentrated first and\r\nforemost on the adoption of practical measures to\r\ndestroy nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThat should apply to all those that possess such\r\nweapons without exception; they should cease insisting\r\non the development of new defensive systems that\r\ncould threaten the worlds strategic stability and trigger\r\na new arms race. Unless the matter is addressed in that\r\nway, disarmament efforts will be meaningless; they\r\nwill remain a great fraud perpetrated on all the peoples\r\nof the world.\r\nDuring the past nine sessions of the General\r\nAssembly, we have reviewed developments in the\r\ndispute between my country and a number of Western\r\ncountries over the United States aeroplane that crashed\r\nover Lockerbie. During the past two sessions, we have\r\nfocused on the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyas cooperation\r\nwith the Scottish court that has been meeting in the\r\nNetherlands since the two Libyan suspects decided\r\nvoluntarily to appear before it. On each occasion, we\r\nhave reiterated our request that the Security Council\r\nlift the sanctions it imposed on the Libyan people,\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nbecause Libya has fully responded to the requirements\r\nof Council resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992) and\r\n1192 (1998). That was confirmed by the report of the\r\nSecretary-General to the Security Council, submitted in\r\nconformity with paragraph 16 of Security Council\r\nresolution 883 (1993).\r\nWe are obliged once again to broach this\r\nquestion, and for a valid reason: the developments of\r\nearlier this year. As members know, on 3 May 2000 the\r\nScottish court began its trial of the two Libyans\r\nsuspected of being linked to the Pan Am aircraft\r\nincident. During the trial it became very clear that the\r\njudges were not convinced of the truth of testimony\r\nfrom the three witnesses offered by the other party as\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution. The court concluded that\r\nthe principal witness in the case, Mr. Abdul Majid\r\nGiaka, was lying, as were Tony Gauci and Edwin\r\nBollier. In paragraph 45 of its opinion, the court stated:\r\nWe have assessed carefully the evidence of\r\nthese three witnesses ... relating to the MST-13\r\ntimers .... All three, and notably Mr. Bollier, were\r\nshown to be unreliable witnesses. [Their various\r\nstatements were] at times in conflict with each\r\nother ... On some occasions, particularly in the\r\ncase of Mr. Bollier, their evidence was self-\r\ncontradictory.\r\nIt was thus fully expected that the Scottish court\r\nwould acquit both suspects for lack of evidence. But\r\nthe decision of 31 January 2001 ran counter to those\r\nexpectations. The court convicted one of the suspects,\r\nMr. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, and acquitted\r\nthe second, Mr. Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah. That\r\njudgement came as a surprise to all political analysts\r\nand jurists, for whom it raised many questions,\r\nincluding why one of the suspects was convicted when\r\nthe two principal prosecution witnesses were proven to\r\nhave lied and when the court found the third unreliable.\r\nHow could the courts decision to convict one man and\r\nacquit the other be explained, since they were both\r\nsuspected on the basis of the same assumptions?\r\nThe only answer to those questions is that, at the\r\nlast moment, the court departed from applying the law\r\nand instead took a political decision. The first to\r\nindicate this was Robert Black, an architect of the\r\nLockerbie court, who said that the elements of the case\r\nagainst Al Megrahi were very weak. And Hans\r\nKöchler, a university professor appointed by the\r\nSecretary-General as an international observer of the\r\ntrial, issued a report dated 3 February 2001, which\r\nincluded many comments, including the following.\r\n[The Opinion] is totally incomprehensible for\r\nany rational observer when one considers that the\r\nindictment in its very essence was based on the\r\njoint action of the two accused in Malta.\r\nThe Opinion of the Court is exclusively\r\nbased on circumstantial evidence and on a series\r\nof highly problematic inferences. As to the\r\nundersigneds knowledge, there is not one single\r\npiece of material evidence linking the two\r\naccused to the crime. In such a context, the guilty\r\nverdict in regard to the first accused appears to be\r\narbitrary, even irrational.\r\n...\r\nThis leads ... to the suspicion that political\r\nconsiderations may have been overriding a\r\nstrictly judicial evaluation of the case.\r\nIn placing these facts before the United Nations\r\nmembership, we want to stress that the conviction\r\nhanded down by the court on 31 January 2001 was a\r\npolitical decision that had nothing to do with the law.\r\nThe Libyan citizen Mr. Al Megrahi was kidnapped for\r\npolitical reasons, as confirmed in resolutions and\r\nstatements adopted by a number of regional\r\norganizations, including at the Lusaka summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the twenty-eighth\r\nministerial session of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference held at Bamako, and the meeting of\r\nForeign Ministers of the League of Arab States held at\r\nCairo earlier this year.\r\nOur gratitude goes to the members of those\r\norganizations and to others that have shown solidarity\r\nwith us from the outset for standing on the side of\r\nright. We call on all Members of the United Nations\r\nthat support right and justice to take the necessary\r\naction to meet the demands of those organizations. The\r\nfirst is the immediate release of Mr. Al Megrahi, who\r\nwas convicted for political reasons that have nothing to\r\ndo with the law. His continued detention amounts to\r\nhostage-taking under all relevant laws and customs.\r\nThe second element of those demands is\r\ncategorical rejection of the stubborn blockage of the\r\nlifting of the sanctions imposed on Libya, which\r\nignores the provisions of paragraph 16 of Security\r\nCouncil 883 (1993) and the findings of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General in that regard. The Security Council\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nshould immediately, totally and permanently lift the\r\nsanctions imposed on Libya, in view of the fact that\r\nLibya has met all the requirements of the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including resolution 1192\r\n(1998). The third element is support for the legitimate\r\nright of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to receive fair\r\ncompensation for the material and human losses it has\r\nincurred as a result of the sanctions.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nThe Honourable Phil Goff, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Trade of New Zealand.\r\nMr. Goff (New Zealand): May I first express my\r\ncondolences to the families and friends of those who\r\ndied in this mornings air crash. This was a tragedy in a\r\ncity that has already seen more than its share of tragedy\r\nin recent times.\r\nWe meet in New York at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly under the shadow of terrorist attacks\r\non this city just two months ago. We mourn the lives of\r\nnearly 5,000 people from 79 countries who, having\r\ndone nothing to deserve that fate, died in the attack.\r\nThe scale, premeditation, coordination and indifference\r\nto mass murder that characterize this attack represent a\r\nnew age of terrorism. It is a terrorism that appears to\r\nset no limit to its consequences. Those responsible for\r\nit foreshadow a willingness to use biological, chemical\r\nand nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The\r\npotentially catastrophic effects if they are able to carry\r\nout that threat demand an urgent and comprehensive\r\nresponse to pre-empt any such action.\r\nWe cannot allow the rule of terror to replace the\r\nrule of law. We cannot tolerate the damage that\r\nterrorism has already done to the global economy. We\r\ncannot allow terror to threaten basic human rights to\r\nlife and security.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes the lead by the United\r\nNations in coordinating an effective and enduring\r\nresponse to terrorism. Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), adopted unanimously, sets out a blueprint for\r\naction which every Member State has an obligation to\r\nimplement. Its emphasis is on measures to close off\r\nfinancial support and the provision of refuge for\r\nterrorist groups in every country of the world.\r\nInternational cooperation in imposing these measures\r\nand bringing the terrorists to justice will, in the longer\r\nterm, lie at the heart of the campaign to defeat\r\nterrorism.\r\nRemoving the immediate threat posed by\r\nterrorists such as those in Al Qaeda and those who\r\nharbour them will, however, require more than\r\nresolutions. Time and again over the past three years,\r\nthe Security Council has called on the Taliban to\r\nprevent the use of Afghanistan by terrorists to launch\r\nstrikes against other countries. Those resolutions and\r\nthe sanctions that accompanied them have been ignored\r\nby the Taliban. Where groups operate beyond the rule\r\nof law and countries put themselves outside of\r\ninternational codes of behaviour, the use of force\r\nbecomes a necessary part of our response.\r\nMultilateral action and cooperation on a wider\r\nfront are also necessary if we are to be successful in\r\nremoving the threat of terrorism on an ongoing and\r\nlasting basis. Comprehensive action is needed to\r\nminimize the threat of chemical, biological or nuclear\r\nweapons falling into the hands of extremist groups. No\r\nState should develop, test and hold weapons of this\r\nnature. Such weapons are a threat to humanity. Their\r\nuse by States would destroy and otherwise harm\r\ninnocent human beings as certainly as did the actions\r\nof the terrorist group that attacked New York.\r\nNations yet to sign and ratify the United Nations\r\nConventions on Chemical and Biological Weapons and\r\ntreaties to ban mines and inhumane weapons must do\r\nso. Nations must equally commit themselves to the\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons, the early entry into\r\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nand an immediate start to negotiations on a fissile\r\nmaterial cut-off treaty.\r\nThe attack of 11 September should also\r\nencourage all nations to ratify the Rome Statute to\r\nbring into effect the International Criminal Court as a\r\nforum for pursuing action against those responsible for\r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nSuppression of terrorism must also involve action\r\nto deal with its causes. States must consider whether\r\nthe suppression of dissident or minority groups rather\r\nthan allowing legitimate channels to voice dissent\r\nleaves resort to force as the only option.\r\nThe events of 11 September should encourage all\r\ncountries and organizations, particularly those directly\r\ninvolved, to renew efforts to find a just and peaceful\r\nsolution to the Middle East crisis. To achieve a\r\npeaceful solution between Palestinians and Israelis\r\nrequires good will and flexibility on both sides. There\r\ncan be no double standards in how the principles of\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nhuman rights, freedom and social and economic\r\nopportunity are applied to all peoples.\r\nOne consequence of the campaign against\r\nterrorism has been to bring the worlds attention to the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan. Afghanistan reminds us that\r\nwhere a vacuum is created by the absence of legitimate\r\ngovernment and the rule of law, it will be filled by\r\nextremist elements, criminal groups dealing in drug\r\ntrafficking and terrorist organizations, all of which can\r\noperate with impunity.\r\nThe international community has for too long\r\nbeen indifferent to the situation in Afghanistan and to\r\nthe long-standing refugee crisis that has resulted from\r\n22 years of war, from famine and from Taliban\r\noppression. Pakistan and Iran have carried the burden\r\nof 3.6 million refugees, while much of the world\r\nshowed concern only when a handful of those refugees\r\nin desperation sought to enter other countries illegally.\r\nToo little concern has been shown internationally to the\r\n300,000 Afghan children who have died annually from\r\npreventable causes. One in three children in refugee\r\ncamps die before they reach the age of five. The groups\r\nnow protesting against military intervention were silent\r\nwhile this human catastrophe was unfolding over the\r\nlast few years.\r\nAny loss of innocent life in conflict is tragic, and\r\nextraordinary measures must be taken to avoid it. But a\r\nfailure to remove the Taliban regime and a failure to\r\nassist the Afghan people to put in place a broad-based,\r\nmoderate and stable Government to replace the Taliban\r\nwill mean the ongoing loss of hundreds of thousands of\r\nlives and the continued suffering of the Afghan people.\r\nRenewed efforts are needed through United\r\nNations agencies to provide emergency relief to people\r\nwithin Afghanistan and in the refugee camps to avoid\r\nunnecessary loss of life through the winter and in the\r\nmonths to come. The United Nations must stand ready\r\nto assist Afghanistan to rebuild itself once the conflict\r\nis over, working with as broad a coalition of Afghan\r\ngroups as is possible to create a viable political,\r\neconomic and social infrastructure.\r\nResolving the problems that have forced so many\r\nmillions of people from their homes is fundamental to\r\nsolving the growing refugee crisis. In Afghanistan and\r\nelsewhere, people flee their homelands through fear of\r\ndeath or persecution, or because of poverty and lack of\r\nopportunity.\r\nIn a world made smaller by advances in\r\ncommunication and transport, no State can ignore the\r\nplight in other countries or expect not to face\r\nconsequences from unacceptable discrepancies in\r\nwealth, opportunity and human rights standards.\r\nSuppression of criminal organizations responsible\r\nfor people trafficking is a challenge which demands\r\nincreased international cooperation. Those who profit\r\nfrom peoples desperation and who, once paid, are\r\ncareless as to whether or not their human cargo\r\nsurvives must be stamped out. However, removing the\r\ncauses of people fleeing from their countries remains\r\nfundamental.\r\nNew Zealands own region of the Pacific has not\r\nbeen immune from violence and instability. In recent\r\nyears, we have seen conflict in East Timor, violence\r\nbetween Government and separatist movements within\r\nIndonesia and in Bougainville, ethnic conflict in the\r\nSolomon Islands and a coup that overthrew a legitimate\r\nGovernment in Fiji.\r\nProblems remain in the region, but there have\r\nbeen notable areas of improvement. A peace settlement\r\nhas been signed in Bougainville. Fiji has held\r\ndemocratic elections. Indonesia is seeking to resolve\r\nseparatist conflict by offering greater autonomy. In\r\nEast Timor, there have been free elections, and that\r\ncountry will gain independence as the first new nation\r\nof the twenty-first century in May 2002. International\r\ncooperation and a capable transitional administration\r\nby the United Nations have achieved a remarkable\r\ntransformation in a poor and devastated country. I\r\ncongratulate the Security Council on its endorsement of\r\nthe Secretary-Generals concept for a post-\r\nindependence United Nations presence in East Timor to\r\nconsolidate what has been achieved.\r\nIn acknowledging the role of United Nations\r\npersonnel, I would also stress the need to ensure their\r\nproper protection in situations which are often\r\ndangerous. The murder of United Nations relief\r\nworkers in Atambua, West Timor, and the failure to\r\nbring to account those fully responsible are a reminder\r\nthat more must be done to protect our United Nations\r\npersonnel. We endorse the Secretary-Generals\r\nrecommendations on extending the legal protection for\r\nUnited Nations and other personnel involved in\r\nhumanitarian operations.\r\nIt is timely at this General Assembly to stress the\r\nimportance of the role of the United Nations. The\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ncritical wars of the twenty-first century will not be won\r\nby single nations, however powerful, or even by\r\ncoalitions. It is the United Nations acting collectively\r\nwhich will win the wars against terrorism, poverty and\r\ndisease; threats to the environment; and the threats\r\nposed by conflict and weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe commitments made by heads of State and\r\nGovernment in the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration last year take on even greater relevance\r\nfollowing the events of 11 September.\r\nHowever, for the United Nations to achieve its\r\npotential, it must undergo reform. To prevent the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat from becoming\r\noverwhelmed by so many tasks that they fail to be\r\neffective in tackling any of them, we need to prioritize\r\nour agenda and to be more selective.\r\nThe Security Council needs reform. Its\r\nmembership should be expanded to reflect\r\ncontemporary realities, but without maintaining or\r\nextending the veto. Countries contributing to\r\npeacekeeping operations should be afforded greater\r\ninvolvement in the Councils decision-making with\r\nrespect to those operations. Peacekeeping operations\r\nmust be sufficiently resourced.\r\nThe capacity of the United Nations for rapid\r\nreaction must be strengthened. New Zealand is ready to\r\nenter into discussions on a memorandum of\r\nunderstanding with the United Nations on its\r\nparticipation in the standby arrangements system. This\r\nis consistent with New Zealands long-standing\r\nreadiness to contribute to peacekeeping operations and\r\nits current involvement in more than 12 such\r\noperations, including its commitment since 1999 of a\r\nbattalion to help ensure the success of the United\r\nNations operation in East Timor.\r\nThe United Nations was founded after the Second\r\nWorld War to build a world free from poverty, violence\r\nand the violation of human rights. Nations committed\r\nthemselves to a collective response to problems that\r\ncould not be solved by countries individually.\r\nCountries agreed on rules of international behaviour.\r\nNo one would claim that the United Nations has\r\nan unblemished record of success. But without it, the\r\nworld would be a much less secure place, much less\r\nable to confront the difficulties which we face. Let this\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly reaffirm\r\nour commitment to work collectively to defeat\r\nterrorism, conflict, poverty and disease, and set the\r\nagenda for peace, development and respect for human\r\nrights for all.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Her Excellency\r\nMs. Lydie Polfer, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nLuxembourg.\r\nMs. Polfer (Luxembourg) (spoke in French):\r\nFirst, I should like to express our very sincere\r\ncondolences and sense of compassion to the families of\r\nthe victims of the tragic accident that occurred this\r\nmorning, as well as to the authorities of the City and\r\nState of New York, which have been so seriously\r\naffected by the terrorist attacks on 11 September.\r\nI should, however, like to congratulate our\r\nPresident, Mr. Han Seung-soo. I am convinced that\r\nwith the cooperation of Member States, he will be able\r\nto conduct this Assembly in a way to ensure that it\r\nresponds ambitiously and effectively to the challenges\r\nbefore it.\r\nPresident Holkeri conducted the Millennium\r\nAssembly deftly, wisely exercising his presidential\r\nauthority and evincing a soothing sense of humour. We\r\nwould like to thank him for that.\r\nOur Secretary-General tirelessly continues his\r\nwork to promote international peace and security.\r\nMember States wish to thank him for the imagination\r\nand wisdom shown as he discharges his lofty\r\nresponsibility, and they have renewed his term of\r\noffice. International public opinion has expressed its\r\ngratitude for his exceptional commitment by giving\r\nhim, together with the United Nations, the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize. We would like to associate ourselves with that\r\ntribute. We congratulate him and wish him the best in\r\nhis difficult work at the head of the Organization.\r\nIn the course of this first session of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, the General Assembly has begun its work\r\nunder the sign of terrorism. The indescribable crime\r\nthat was committed on 11 September 2001 against the\r\nUnited States of America and its citizens, male and\r\nfemale, represents a breakdown in international\r\nrelations. It was not only America that was targeted by\r\nthis infamous attack against the World Trade Center\r\ntowers  it was our lifestyle in an open, democratic,\r\ntolerant and multicultural society to which the broad\r\nmajority of countries and peoples represented here\r\naspire. That is unbearable to terrorists.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nCivilian airplanes have become guided missiles\r\nthrough blind and murderous terrorism, and as a result\r\nwe all feel attacked. We cant call this a confrontation\r\nhere between civilizations, combat between North and\r\nSouth, between religions. The perpetrators of the\r\nrepugnant attack of 11 September wish to deny by their\r\nact the very values that form the basis of the\r\ninternational community, which we have endeavoured\r\nto build for the past 50 years through the United\r\nNations and its multilateral system.\r\nThe subsequent discussion in public opinion has\r\nshown that our societies do not yet know each other\r\nwell enough. Ignorance leads to distrust and even\r\nhostility, promoting a chilling self-absorption.\r\nDialogue among civilizations, as promoted and\r\npractised by our Organization, must now more than\r\never be at the forefront of our considerations.\r\nHaving expressed its compassion for the innocent\r\nvictims of those cowardly attacks, the international\r\ncommunity must now react with determination to\r\nensure that the perpetrators receive the punishment\r\nthey deserve and to defend itself in such a way as to\r\nprevent such acts in the future. I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the United\r\nStates of America in its exercise of its legitimate right\r\nto self-defence.\r\nTwo days ago, the current President of the\r\nEuropean Union, Mr. Louis Michel, gave a detailed\r\ndescription of the measures and initiatives taken by the\r\n15 member States to combat the scourge of terrorism.\r\nLuxembourg is participating unreservedly in this joint\r\neffort.\r\nOnly through coordinated and interdisciplinary\r\nwork will we be able to fight all forms of terrorism.\r\nOur response must be commensurate with the threat,\r\nwhile respecting the fundamental freedoms of the\r\ncitizen  a principle that underlies our civilization.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Afghanistan, we\r\nmust work under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nwith a view to promoting the emergence of a stable and\r\nlegitimate Government that is representative of the\r\nAfghan population as a whole. Such a Government\r\nmust respect the human rights of the Afghan people\r\nand develop good-neighbourly relations with all the\r\ncountries of the region. In that context, I should like to\r\nwelcome in particular the activities of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for\r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Brahimi.\r\nAs soon as its objective has been achieved, the\r\ninternational community, through the concerted efforts\r\nof the United Nations, the International Committee of\r\nthe Red Cross and other international organizations,\r\nshould set up an ambitious programme that is both\r\npolitical and humanitarian, with a view to helping to\r\nreconstruct Afghanistan and to ensure its integration\r\nwithin a stabilized region. Such an effort will require\r\nintensified political dialogue with all of the countries\r\nof the region.\r\nAt this time, the provision of assistance to the\r\ncivilian population in Afghanistan and to the refugees\r\nacross its borders is a matter of priority. My country\r\nhas already raised almost 7 million euros for that\r\npurpose as part of a comprehensive effort within the\r\nEuropean Union amounting to more than 320 million\r\neuros.\r\nAlthough there are no grounds for making a\r\ndirect connection between the events of 11 September\r\nand the situation in the Middle East, the situation there\r\nis becoming increasingly worrying. We note that,\r\nunfortunately, the fabric that was woven during 10\r\nyears of mediation efforts and that was almost\r\ncompleted at Taba is now unravelling before our eyes.\r\nDuring my recent visit to the region, I noted the extent\r\nto which the peace process, which has been deadlocked\r\nfor far too long, is suffering from the absence of any\r\nreal prospects and from increasing distrust among the\r\nparties.\r\nThat is why, together with our colleagues from\r\nthe European Union, we are stepping up our efforts to\r\nconvince the parties that only the cessation of violence\r\nand the recognition of two States will make it possible\r\nfor negotiations to resume that can lead to a just and\r\nlasting peace in the region, on the basis of the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State and the right of\r\nIsrael to live in peace and security. The European\r\nUnion stands ready to provide a framework for this\r\nprocess, in cooperation with the United States of\r\nAmerica and the Arab States of the region, and to assist\r\nthe parties with a view to facilitating the reconciliation\r\nthat is necessary.\r\nIn the meantime, the United Nations will\r\ntirelessly pursue its efforts to achieve international\r\npeace and stability. In 2001, four reports of the\r\nSecretary-General  dealing with peacekeeping,\r\nhumanitarian action, the prevention of conflict and the\r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Summit  have shown\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nthe way forward. They show that it is necessary for the\r\ninternational community to be steadfast in its\r\ncommitment to the prevention and management of\r\nconflict.\r\nAny hesitation or fleeting expression of\r\ndisinterest might risk encouraging elements that may\r\nwant to aggressively defend their own interests without\r\nregard for the consequences at the national or\r\ninternational level. Europe has witnessed such dramatic\r\nchains of events, particularly in the Balkans, and we\r\ncan only feel a sense of humility when considering\r\ntheir disastrous effects.\r\nIf this year the United Nations has not been on\r\nthe front line in the Balkans, it has been working hard\r\nin the area of peacekeeping. I would like to make two\r\ncomments about these operations. First, we note that\r\nthere has been a considerable improvement in the\r\nquality of their management, following the conclusions\r\nof the Brahimi report. Secondly, there has been an\r\ninternational commitment to deal with hotbeds of\r\ntension as diverse and complex as those of Kosovo,\r\nEast Timor, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nThe balance sheet is relatively encouraging.\r\nKosovo will soon be holding elections that will have\r\nimportant consequences for the future of the province.\r\nThe United Nations operation in East Timor can,\r\nperhaps, be viewed as a clear success for international\r\naction. Attempts to restructure peacekeeping operations\r\nhave been promoted through careful consideration in\r\nthe Secretariat, the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly, based upon an outstanding follow-up report.\r\nThe complexity of crisis situations often, of\r\ncourse, demands a prudent response, even when real\r\nprogress has been made, as is the case in Sierra Leone.\r\nIt is even more important to document international\r\ndetermination through clear mandates that allow for a\r\nstrong response. We believe that the inclusion of troop-\r\ncontributing countries in the decision-making process\r\nis essential. The increasingly integrated approach that\r\nhas been chosen, as illustrated by the United Nations\r\nInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo and the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East\r\nTimor, is designed to ensure a logical succession\r\nbetween the phases of prevention, peacekeeping and,\r\nfinally, consolidation, reconstruction and development.\r\nOne of the most urgent tasks of our Organization\r\nis to provide immediate assistance for civilian\r\npopulations that are the victims of natural disasters or\r\ncrises brought about by human intervention.\r\nLuxembourg attaches particular importance to such\r\nneeds, and we are endeavouring to support United\r\nNations offices in this physically and morally\r\ndemanding task. Since the fall of 2000, we have been\r\ncoordinating, on an informal basis, the donor countries\r\nin New York, and our delegation takes pleasure in\r\nnoting the dedication of the competent officials and\r\nauthorities who head these services. I would like to\r\nassure the Assembly that my country is clearly aware\r\nof the need to protect, and ensure the safety of,\r\npersonnel.\r\nHumanitarian action, prevention, ceasefire\r\nagreements and peace-building activities hardly\r\nconstitute the entire agenda of the international\r\ncommunity. A functioning democracy is a major asset\r\nin progress towards development, as I have already\r\nemphasized. I need only reaffirm the importance of\r\nnational efforts to combat corruption and foster the\r\nestablishment, within our societies, of the rule of law\r\nbased on an equitable and properly functioning legal\r\nsystem.\r\nMy country welcomes the efforts under way\r\nwithin the United Nations to put an end to impunity\r\nand to ensure that those responsible for committing\r\ncrimes against humanity and other atrocities answer for\r\ntheir actions within an international criminal\r\njurisdiction.\r\nA special tribunal to judge crimes committed\r\nduring the course of the civil war is in the process of\r\nbeing established in Sierra Leone, and Luxembourg has\r\nmade a financial contribution to its establishment. In\r\nCambodia, a law to establish a tribunal to consider the\r\natrocities and genocide perpetrated under the\r\ndictatorship of the Khmer Rouge is now in force, and\r\nwe must assess its compatibility with the memorandum\r\nproposed by the United Nations. The Tribunals in The\r\nHague and Arusha have stepped up their work, and, for\r\nthe first time, a former head of State is awaiting his\r\ntrial in prison. We welcome these developments, as\r\nwell as those who have joined us in the group of\r\ncountries that have ratified the Rome Statute of the\r\nfuture International Criminal Court. The citizens of\r\nLuxembourg would be pleased to see that convention\r\nenter into force as soon as possible and acceded to by a\r\nbroad majority of States.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nIn September 2000, heads of State and\r\nGovernment met here in New York. Since then, the\r\nMillennium Declaration has underpinned the actions of\r\nthe United Nations and of States at the national level.\r\nTogether with its European partners, Luxembourg has\r\naffirmed its dedication to the commitments entered into\r\nthere.\r\nI conclude by citing two facts that illustrate the\r\nawareness of my countrys Government of the\r\nresponsibilities its shares with all here in preparing for\r\nthe future of coming generations. First, official\r\ndevelopment assistance from Luxembourg has reached\r\n0.71 per cent of our gross national product; the\r\nGovernment has decided to raise it to 1 per cent by\r\n2005. I have also submitted to my countrys Chamber\r\nof Deputies Luxembourgs first nomination to serve as\r\na non-permanent member of the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohamed Benaissa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco.\r\nMr. Benaissa (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, I wish to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\non behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco, on his election\r\nto preside over the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession and to offer him our full support as he carries\r\nout his important task. I also take this opportunity to\r\nthank and congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, on the effective and decisive manner in which\r\nhe conducted the work of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fifth session.\r\nI also pay tribute to our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for all his efforts in serving the\r\nOrganization and the international community as a\r\nwhole and I congratulate him sincerely on his re-\r\nelection to his post and on receiving the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize for 2001.\r\nWe have all been struck and shaken by the\r\nheinous terrorist acts that took place on 11 September\r\nin the United States. They were an attack upon\r\nthousands of innocent lives and a clear violation of all\r\nthe religious, humanitarian and cultural values that we\r\nhold dear. Whatever our attitude towards and\r\nevaluation of those events may be, international\r\nrelations have taken a different turn and a fateful\r\noutlook since that day. Those events were epic in their\r\nresonance and the extent of their repercussions is not\r\nyet clear. One thing is clear, however: we will have to\r\nface new challenges and new constraints. Morocco\r\nreaffirms its full condemnation of these actions and\r\ncalls on all countries to mobilize their efforts to\r\neradicate terrorism at its very roots. Terrorism\r\nrepresents a threat not merely to international peace\r\nand security, but to the human race as a whole.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations is the most\r\nappropriate institution for investigating the deepest\r\ncauses of terrorism, not least because of the resolutions\r\nof the Security Council and the General Assembly\r\nestablishing a unified and comprehensive set of\r\nguidelines on this wide-ranging subject. That is why\r\nwe call on all competent bodies to do everything\r\npossible to fulfil their responsibilities for combating or\r\npreventing terrorism. Morocco is a multi-ethnic State\r\nfounded on tolerance, equality and respect for\r\ninternational law. It will contribute fully to the fight\r\nagainst the scourge of terrorism and its dangers.\r\nIt is absolutely clear that the question of the\r\nMiddle East is one of the most serious regional\r\nconflicts that the world has experienced in the past 50\r\nyears. Recently, we have seen a dangerous escalation in\r\nthe conflict that has taken hundreds of lives, including\r\nthose of many women and children, and undermined\r\nthe infrastructure and services of the occupied\r\nterritories of Palestine. Morocco has therefore\r\ncondemned the attacks and called for a lifting of the\r\nsiege of Palestinian towns and villages, where homes,\r\nschools and fields have been bulldozed. The forced\r\ncolonization of Palestinian areas occupied since 1967\r\nmust come to an end. We must break the vicious cycle\r\nof violence and reprisals, and return to the negotiating\r\ntable on the basis of the conclusions of the Mitchell\r\nreport and signed agreements between Israel and the\r\nPalestinians.\r\nMorocco feels that peace between the Arabs and\r\nIsraelis will have to entail an Israeli withdrawal from\r\nall the land occupied since 1967 in Palestine and the\r\nSyrian Golan Heights and that part of the territory of\r\nLebanon that remains under Israeli occupation. This\r\nmust take place on the basis of full compliance with\r\ninternational law, in particular Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the\r\ndecisions of the Madrid Conference, which called for\r\nan exchange of land for peace. In this context, we\r\nheard with satisfaction the statement made by President\r\nBush concerning the establishment of a Palestinian\r\nState and the expression of the will of the United States\r\nAdministration to resume its active role in reviving the\r\npeace process in order to achieve a just, lasting,\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ncomprehensive and genuine peace for all the peoples\r\nand States of the region.\r\nMorocco takes this opportunity to reiterate its\r\nconcern over the suffering of the brotherly people of\r\nIraq and the deterioration of the humanitarian situation\r\nin that country. These are direct results of the economic\r\nsanctions that have been imposed on that nation for the\r\npast 10 years and more. Morocco hopes that the talks\r\nunder way between the United Nations and the\r\nGovernment of Iraq will help towards the lifting of the\r\nsanctions and put an end to the despair, pain and\r\nsuffering of the Iraqi people.\r\nMorocco welcomes all the efforts to be made by\r\nthe United Nations and the Iraqi Government in the\r\ndialogue, which will be held in confidence and\r\nfrankness, to find a just solution to the problem of\r\ndetainees and people missing since the Gulf War.\r\nMorocco supports both the independence and\r\nsovereignty of Kuwait and the sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity of Iraq itself.\r\nThe settlement of armed conflicts is also of\r\ncrucial importance to Africa, which, unfortunately, is\r\nstill being plagued by bloody but entirely contrived\r\nconfrontations. What is happening in Africa requires\r\nour Organization to adopt a new and pragmatic\r\napproach enabling us to maintain and strengthen peace\r\nin Africa on the basis of respect for ceasefires and the\r\nencouragement of dialogue between the parties, and\r\nconfidence-building. We need to provide for preventive\r\naction, as stated by the Secretary-General at the\r\nopening of this session of the General Assembly. We\r\nneed early warning mechanisms for areas of tension. If\r\nwe have such mechanisms, then we will be able to deal\r\nwith the deep causes of conflict, like injustice, poverty,\r\nepidemics and refugees.\r\nMorocco, which is eager to support peace and\r\nsecurity in Africa, welcomes all efforts undertaken in\r\nthis area by the United Nations and international and\r\nregional organizations. Morocco, as always, has\r\nresponded this year to the United Nations request for\r\ntroops from the Moroccan Royal Armed Forces to\r\nparticipate in the international peacekeeping operations\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco is determined to\r\nexpedite the process of constructing the Arab Mahgreb\r\nUnion as a strong and balanced regional organization\r\nthat will lead to permanent stability in the region and\r\nstrengthen economic, social and cultural institutions. It\r\nwould also enter into fruitful partnership with other\r\nregional organizations, including the European Union.\r\nMorocco remains convinced that such a Union is\r\ninevitable and most useful.\r\nThe efforts to establish a Mahgreb organization,\r\nhowever, depend upon finding an enduring, just and\r\nfinal solution to the problem of the Sahara. The conflict\r\nthere is a stumbling block preventing the fulfilment of\r\nthe hopes of the peoples of the Mahgreb for good\r\nrelations, complementarity, stability, prosperity and\r\npeace. It is these hopes that have guided us since\r\nindependence, especially since the historic conference\r\nin Tangiers in 1958. Although some claim otherwise,\r\nthe settlement plan did not come to a halt because of\r\nthe huge number of challenges following the\r\nidentification process, but because of the huge\r\ndifficulties mentioned by the Secretary-General himself\r\nin his last three reports to the Security Council.\r\nFinally  and again contrary to the claims of\r\nsome  the Security Council, in resolution 1359\r\n(2001), requested the four parties concerned in the\r\nSahara conflict to begin negotiations on the basis of the\r\nframework agreement tabled by the Secretary-General\r\nin the Security Council and known as the Baker plan.\r\nIn fact, the initiative of the Secretary-General,\r\nenshrined in the draft framework agreement, is aimed\r\nat a negotiated settlement of the conflict. As the\r\nSecretary-General himself put it, this is a last chance to\r\nreach a speedy and final settlement in the Sahara\r\nconflict. Morocco accepted the draft framework\r\nagreement as a basis for negotiation, and is ready to\r\ncontinue cooperating with the Security Council, the\r\nSecretary-General and his personal representative,\r\nMr. James Baker, in order to achieve a just, peaceful\r\nand final settlement of the Sahara issue.\r\nIn keeping with international law and the Charter,\r\nMorocco invites all other parties to provide the same\r\npositive response to the appeal contained in Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1359 (2001) to start negotiations in\r\norder to achieve a political solution of this totally\r\ncontrived conflict.\r\nThe fact that Spain continues to occupy two\r\nMoroccan cities, Ceuta and Melilla, and the islands off\r\nthe coast of Morocco that are near them, is a pure\r\nanachronism and totally out of line with the values and\r\nprinciples upheld by the international community.\r\nMorocco, which would like to see a European-\r\nMediterranean community and dialogue between the\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ntwo shores of the Mediterranean, considers that a good\r\nrelationship based on cooperation and good\r\nneighbourliness with Spain is one of our basic strategic\r\ngoals. However, if we are to achieve that goal, Spain\r\nwill have to show an understanding of and good faith\r\ntowards Moroccos rightful claims on Ceuta and\r\nMelilla and the islands off the coast of Morocco, so\r\nthat Moroccan sovereignty over this territory can be\r\nexercised, with full guarantees for the economic, social\r\nand cultural rights of the Spanish residents of these two\r\ncities. There have been similar precedents, in places\r\nlike Hong Kong and Macao. Thus, we can refer to such\r\nprevious settlements that will be in the interests of both\r\nMorocco and Spain.\r\nChanges in the world economy make it essential\r\nfor Mediterranean countries to give their economic\r\nrelationships a strong impetus based on new concepts\r\nand approaches. That is why Morocco has tabled very\r\nambitious projects with some of the other countries in\r\nthe eastern and southern Mediterranean regions.\r\nThere is the initiative of His Majesty King\r\nMohammed VI, known as the Agadir declaration of\r\n8 May 2001, which provides for the enlargement of the\r\nfree-trade zone that now exists on the basis of\r\nagreements between Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and\r\nTunisia. The ideas for this free-trade area to be\r\nenlarged with the involvement of other Arab\r\nMediterranean States form a solid basis for the States\r\non the south and east coasts of the Mediterranean to\r\nintegrate in a framework of partnership and\r\ncooperation, as under the Barcelona Declaration,\r\ninvolving countries on the north shore of the\r\nMediterranean and the European Union in general.\r\nInternational peace and security do not depend\r\nonly on responses to political challenges. They also\r\ndepend on social and economic problems. We\r\nspecifically cite problems of the environment and lack\r\nof natural resources, where there are so many\r\nchallenges facing our planet, not least of which is\r\naccess to water and drinking water at a reasonable\r\nprice. My country had the honour of contributing to\r\nthis cause at the seventh Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Climate Change Convention, which took place in\r\nMarrakech between 29 October and 9 November 2001.\r\nThis Conference resulted in positive steps on the way\r\ntowards an international conference on sustainable\r\ndevelopment to be held in Johannesburg next year.\r\nWith regard to the social issues that are of\r\nconcern to international organizations, the Kingdom of\r\nMorocco considers that the United Nations should\r\nincrease its efforts to benefit children, because they are\r\nthe future of the human race. The Kingdom of\r\nMorocco, upon the recommendation and leadership of\r\nits sovereign, His Majesty Mohammed VI and their\r\nRoyal Highnesses Prince Moulay Rachid and Princess\r\nLalla Meriem, has spared no effort at the regional and\r\ninternational levels to ensure the success of the Global\r\nMovement for Children. Morocco has in this regard\r\norganized three important conferences on children this\r\nyear aimed at mobilizing all possible resources \r\nregional, Arab and African  in order to make sure\r\nthat children enjoy their rights to health, education and\r\njustice. Based on such convictions, Morocco is\r\ndetermined to effectively contribute to the success of\r\nthe special session on children to be held next year.\r\nFor the second time in 10 years, our Organization\r\nhas received the Nobel Peace Prize, which is both an\r\nhonour and a burden. An honour for its success in\r\npreventing wars and in settling disputes peacefully; and\r\na burden because it leads to rethinking the role of the\r\nOrganization so it can become an effective tool in\r\nresponding to the new challenges and so it can fulfil its\r\ngoals of building a world in which peace and security\r\nprevail and in which all peoples of the world can\r\nharvest the fruits of technological and scientific\r\nadvances. Let us therefore rise to the level of such\r\nchallenges and engage in a true partnership and solid\r\nvisionary outlook so we can achieve these noble\r\nobjectives.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mikhail M. Khvostov, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Belarus.\r\nMr. Khvostov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of Belarus would like to express its deepest\r\nsympathy to the families of the victims of the plane\r\ncrash that occurred this morning in New York, as well\r\nas to the Governments of the United States and the\r\nDominican Republic.\r\nMy delegation would also like to congratulate the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession on his election to that responsible post. His\r\nelection is undoubtedly clear recognition of the\r\nRepublic of Koreas role in international affairs. We\r\nwould also like to express our gratitude to the President\r\nof the General Assembly at the previous session,\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri. His successful presidency of the\r\nMillennium Summit and Assembly is a clear example\r\nof his personal talent and leadership skills.\r\nThe United Nations is entering the new century\r\nunder the leadership of Mr. Kofi Annan. His\r\nunanimous re-election by the General Assembly to a\r\nsecond five-year term came as an unequivocal\r\nacknowledgement of great appreciation for his work as\r\nSecretary-General. We welcome the recent well-\r\nfounded decision by the International Nobel Committee\r\nto grant the Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations,\r\nand to Mr. Kofi Annan personally.\r\nThe consequences of the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 against New York and Washington,\r\nD.C., are as present and as painful as ever. In that\r\nregard, our country does not consider this session of\r\nthe General Assembly just a regular event in the life of\r\nthe United Nations. For Belarus, the point is that, as\r\nMember States, all of us must demonstrate collective\r\nwisdom and display the collective will to make our\r\nworld less vulnerable in the face of acts of insanity that\r\npush not only individual countries but the whole of\r\nhumanity to the very edge of a global catastrophe.\r\nAs a responsible member of the international\r\ncommunity, the Republic of Belarus cannot remain\r\nindifferent to this threat. In his message to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, the President of the Republic of\r\nBelarus, Mr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, clearly explained\r\nthe views of our country with regard to international\r\nactivities to combat terrorism:\r\nIn the present situation, the role of the United\r\nNations in consolidating the efforts of States in\r\nthe fight against terrorism is growing in stature.\r\nWe can achieve real success in this effort only\r\nwhen the unique capabilities of the United\r\nNations are used, especially as regards\r\neradicating the root causes that generate and\r\nsupport terrorism. We believe that the United\r\nNations should be at the centre of the efforts to\r\ndevelop strategies and tactics for the measures to\r\nbe taken by the international community to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nHaving actively supported all the anti-terrorist\r\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council and\r\nGeneral Assembly, and being party to the 12 United\r\nNations conventions on terrorism, Belarus welcomes\r\nthe measures aimed at defining and eradicating not\r\nonly terrorism itself but also its root causes. We firmly\r\nsupport the work of the Committee established by the\r\nSecurity Council under resolution 1373 (2001), and are\r\nready to cooperate closely with that body.\r\nLast year, during the Millennium Summit and\r\nAssembly, we called for the preservation of the United\r\nNations as a unique universal international institution\r\nuniting all the countries of the world. When we talk\r\nabout establishing the conditions necessary for\r\neffective implementation of the goals set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration we are talking about the future\r\nof the Organization itself. We believe that the\r\nimplementation by the United Nations of the provisions\r\nof the Millennium Declaration during the first year\r\nafter the holding of the Millennium Summit is cause\r\nfor a certain optimism. In that regard, I would like to\r\nunderscore that the Republic of Belarus has already\r\ndrafted a special governmental programme on\r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe important thing that we have come to realize\r\nis that there is an organic link between development,\r\npeace and security in the context of globalization. The\r\nrecent tragic events in the United States of America\r\nreaffirmed that interdependence. Belarus welcomes the\r\nintensive work undertaken at the United Nations in\r\n2001 in preparation for the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development. We are convinced that this\r\nforum must lay the foundation for a new international\r\nconsensus on global economic and financial issues.\r\nBelarus believes that such a consensus should be built\r\nwhile taking into consideration the specific interests\r\nand needs of countries at different stages of social and\r\neconomic development. The overall success of the\r\nforum will ultimately depend on the application of that\r\napproach.\r\nWhile addressing the most pressing social and\r\neconomic challenges of the modern world, we must not\r\nweaken our focus on the area of international security\r\nand disarmament. The statistics on military\r\nexpenditures, which have reached $800 billion per year\r\nworldwide, are of particular concern in the present\r\nalarming international situation. It should be noted that\r\nour country has been pursuing a consistent policy in\r\nthe field of disarmament. We have made a significant\r\ncontribution to the consolidation and development of\r\ninternational non-proliferation regimes for weapons of\r\nmass destruction, including a reduction in the number\r\nof such weapons and the elimination of existing\r\narsenals.\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nBelarus has been consistently and\r\ncomprehensively fulfilling the provisions of all nuclear\r\ndisarmament treaties to which our country is a party.\r\nThe recent concluding inspection under the Treaty on\r\nthe Elimination of Intermediate-Range and Shorter-\r\nRange Missiles, which was carried out in Belarus in\r\nFebruary 2001, confirmed our countrys strict\r\nobservance of all the conditions envisaged in that\r\ndocument. As a nation that voluntary relinquished\r\npossession of nuclear weapons and completely\r\nwithdrew them from its territory in 1996, Belarus is\r\ndetermined to advocate the necessity of providing\r\nlegally binding guarantees to non-nuclear States,\r\nincluding the elaboration of an appropriate\r\ninternational convention to that end.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus is among the States that\r\nconsider the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to be a\r\ncritical component of maintaining strategic stability.\r\nThe outcome of decades of tense negotiations in the\r\nsearch for a compromise that saved the world from a\r\ngrowing nuclear threat must not be dismissed. Strategic\r\nstability is a practical imperative for each and every\r\nState without exception. Negotiations on such an\r\nimportant issue should be conducted on a multilateral,\r\nnon-bloc basis with the participation of all interested\r\nStates and in strict conformity with the provisions of\r\nthe Charter.\r\nWe welcome the efforts undertaken for the\r\nuniversal prohibition of chemical weapons and support\r\nthe destruction, as soon as possible, of existing arsenals\r\nof weapons-grade poisons, as well as the efforts to\r\nachieve the universality of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. This summer\r\nBelarus concluded its agreement with the Organization\r\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the\r\nprivileges and immunities of that organization.\r\nWe also pursue a similarly responsible and\r\nconsistent policy with regard to reducing conventional\r\nweapons. In strict implementation of the Treaty on\r\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe, Belarus was\r\namong the first of the parties to that Treaty to ratify the\r\nagreement on the adaptation of the Treaty. Ratification\r\nby the Republic of Belarus of the Treaty on Open Skies\r\nin 2001 is proof of our consistent policy in this field.\r\nOne important dimension of our foreign policy is\r\nto make practical contributions to the strengthening of\r\nregional stability, based on the principle of\r\ncomprehensive and mutually beneficial cooperation\r\nwith neighbouring countries in all areas relevant to\r\nsecurity and disarmament. As part of this policy,\r\nBelarus has concluded an agreement with Lithuania on\r\nmeasures for strengthening confidence and\r\ntransparency, and we are making progress towards\r\nsigning similar agreements with Ukraine and Poland.\r\nConflict prevention remains among the most\r\nimportant issues on the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nThe events of the past year have proved that the\r\ninitiatives undertaken by the United Nations, together\r\nwith the active personal involvement of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and complemented by the work of regional\r\norganizations and individual United Nations Member\r\nStates, have been an effective  and very often the\r\nonly  solution to the escalation of conflicts in various\r\nregions of the world.\r\nThis is the appropriate point to mention the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan, which is of particular concern\r\nto the international community. Developments in that\r\ncountry and in the region as a whole run the risk of\r\nspiraling out of control. Military force cannot resolve\r\ncomplex problems that have been building up for years.\r\nWe are convinced that the complex tensions within\r\nAfghan society can be defused only by means of a\r\nbalanced domestic dialogue based on strict compliance\r\nwith the standards of international law.\r\nIt is essential not to weaken the intensifying\r\npolitical effort to give a new impetus to the peace\r\nprocess in the Middle East. There is no alternative to\r\nthe peaceful establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State through political negotiations, based\r\non the strict observance of Security Council resolutions\r\nalready adopted and the decisions of other relevant\r\ninternational forums. It is regrettable that the Security\r\nCouncil was unable to reach consensus on a United\r\nNations presence in the region at this crucial moment.\r\nWe consider it extremely important that we continue\r\nour efforts to settle unresolved problems on the\r\nLebanese track, in tandem with the complete\r\nwithdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights.\r\nWe are also concerned about the situation in\r\nKosovo and Macedonia as the result of aggressive\r\nseparatism and international terrorism. Here, too, we\r\nbelieve that political logic must prevail over the logic\r\nof force. On the eve of the forthcoming general\r\nelection in Kosovo, Belarus confirms its adherence to\r\nthe principle of the territorial integrity of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and supports the diplomatic\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ninitiative by the Russian Federation legally to confirm\r\nthe existing national borders in the Balkans.\r\nThe situation in Africa continues to remain\r\nunstable. We believe that the establishment of the\r\nAfrican Union and the further strengthening of other\r\nAfrican regional structures, with an effective United\r\nNations involvement, are important prerequisites for\r\nthe maintenance of peace and stability in that\r\ncontinent. A comprehensive approach envisaging\r\nintegration of the political, economic and social\r\nresources of the African States is of crucial importance.\r\nBelarus supports the immediate implementation of all\r\nthe decisions taken at the Summit of the Organization\r\nof African Unity held in Lusaka, Zambia, in July 2001.\r\nIt is important to maintain the momentum that has\r\nbeen created in the political process leading to\r\nstatehood for East Timor and to its admission, as a\r\nfully fledged member, into the world family of nations.\r\nWe must encourage the active efforts being\r\nundertaken to continue dialogue, on the basis of\r\nequality, between North and South Korea.\r\nThe Cyprus problem continues to be a pressing\r\nissue. We call for the resumption of negotiations on\r\nthis question, in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus has been increasing its\r\nparticipation in major United Nations international\r\nlegal instruments in a number of strategically important\r\nareas. These include the combat against organized\r\ncrime and drug trafficking. Belarus has signed the\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime and its supplementary Protocol to\r\nPrevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,\r\nEspecially Women and Children, as well as the\r\nProtocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land,\r\nSea, and Air.\r\nBeyond that, the Republic of Belarus has become\r\na party to the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism, the Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel, the Convention\r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees, the Protocol\r\nAmending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly\r\nrepresents an important stage in the process of\r\nestablishing a legal framework for Belarus to join the\r\nUnited Nations system of peacekeeping operations. On\r\n1 October 2001, the Republic of Belarus signed a\r\nmemorandum of understanding with the Secretariat\r\nregarding its participation in the United Nations\r\nStandby Arrangements System. We see the recent visit\r\nof representatives of the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations to Belarus to test and select Belarusian\r\ncandidates for United Nations civilian police\r\ncontingents as an important initial step in the process\r\nof implementing this memorandum.\r\nOf major importance in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration is the promotion by Member States of the\r\nprinciples of sustainable development. It remains clear,\r\nhowever, that implementation of the paradigm of\r\nsustainable development in many developing countries\r\nand in countries with economies in transition continues\r\nto be confronted with major difficulties.\r\nIn this regard, we attach particular importance to\r\npreparations for the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Johannesburg in 2002. We\r\nconsider the Rio + 10 Summit to be an appropriate\r\nforum for defining new approaches to the solution of\r\nglobal problems and for developing new and effective\r\nfinancial, institutional and legal mechanisms for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is of\r\nfundamental importance to my country, since it will\r\nconsider issues relating to the cleanup of the\r\nconsequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower plant. The economic, social and humanitarian\r\nramifications of this problem cannot be overestimated.\r\nSuffice it to mention here just one figure: over the past\r\ndecade, Belarus has spent $12.5 billion on the cleanup\r\nof the Chernobyl disaster. However, the people living\r\nin the contaminated areas have not yet been able to\r\nreturn to their normal way of life. There is a need\r\nfurther to rally international support for my countrys\r\nefforts to mitigate and minimize the aftermath of the\r\nChernobyl catastrophe.\r\nIn this context, we greatly appreciate the\r\ninitiatives proposed by the Under-Secretary-General\r\nfor Humanitarian Affairs, Mr. Kenzo Oshima, to\r\nintensify international post-Chernobyl cooperation,\r\nincluding shifting its focus towards assistance for\r\nsustainable development of the contaminated areas and\r\nenhancing the regions human potential. The findings\r\nand outcome of the special United Nations assessment\r\nmission to the three most affected States earlier this\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nyear are expected significantly to contribute to the\r\nunderstanding of what precisely should be done in the\r\nnear future. In the course of the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, a draft resolution entitled\r\nStrengthening of International Cooperation and\r\nCoordination of Efforts to Study, Mitigate and\r\nMinimize the Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster\r\nhas jointly been submitted by the Governments of\r\nBelarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. I call\r\nupon all delegations to support it.\r\nIn his road map towards the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration, our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, observed quite\r\nrightly that\r\nThe international community has just emerged\r\nfrom an era of commitment. It must now enter an\r\nera of implementation. (A/56/326, para. 11)\r\nThis means that the successful implementation of\r\nthe Organizations strategy in this era of globalization\r\ndepends on us, as United Nations Member States, and\r\nus alone. This is not only our common privilege; it is\r\nalso our common responsibility.\r\nBelarus is confident that the United Nations and\r\nthe international community are capable of mobilizing\r\npolitical will and technological and intellectual\r\nresources for the sake of building a stable and\r\nprosperous world.\r\nFor the Republic of Belarus, the tenth anniversary\r\nof its independence coincided with the second\r\npresidential elections in the history of my country. The\r\nsupport of the overwhelming majority of voters for\r\nMr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka confirmed the soundness\r\nof the democratic foundations of the Belarusian\r\nsociety.\r\nSimilarly, the foreign policy of our country will\r\nremain consistent and constructive. It will be guided\r\nexclusively by the basic principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and universally recognized norms of\r\ninternational law, including the aspiration for the\r\nestablishment of a world order in which the interests of\r\nall countries, big and small, developed and developing,\r\nin both the North and the South, are equitably taken\r\ninto account. Cooperation with all United Nations\r\nMember States on a mutually beneficial and\r\nconstructive basis will remain the central priority for\r\nthe Republic of Belarus.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Brian Cowen, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Ireland.\r\nMr. Cowen (Ireland): I congratulate the President\r\non his election as President of the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly and thank him for his successful\r\nefforts to take forward the work of this Assembly. My\r\ncolleague, Foreign Minister Louis Michel of Belgium,\r\nhas already addressed this General Assembly on behalf\r\nof the European Union. Ireland associates itself fully\r\nwith his remarks.\r\nWe meet at a moment of uncertainty. The spectre\r\nof war once again casts its shadow across the\r\ncontinents. Forty years ago, when addressing the\r\nAssembly, President John F. Kennedy warned:\r\nMankind must put an end to war or war will put an\r\nend to mankind. Of course, President Kennedy was\r\naddressing a different world from the one we now live\r\nin. The war he feared was a war between two great\r\npower blocs that would end in assured mutual\r\nannihilation.\r\nThankfully, the threat of conflict on such a scale\r\nis now a far more remote prospect, but war and conflict\r\ncontinue to cause enormous suffering in many parts of\r\nthe world. This, together with the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction  nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological  means that war and its mutation,\r\nterrorism, continue to threaten mankind  our lives,\r\nour liberty and our prosperity.\r\nThis is simply not acceptable. We, the peoples of\r\nthe United Nations, created, joined and sustained this\r\nOrganization in the determination to save this and\r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. We\r\nmust now demonstrate renewed and sustained\r\ncommitment to the realization of this goal.\r\nMany speakers in this debate have spoken about\r\nthe events of 11 September as a defining moment in\r\nhistory. During the twentieth century, we faced a\r\nnumber of such defining moments  the First World\r\nWar, the Second World War and the fall of the Berlin\r\nWall, which heralded the end of the cold war. These\r\ndefining moments are perhaps best reflected in the\r\npopular phrase found on the lips of men and women of\r\nall races and creeds at such times: Things will never\r\nbe the same again. Out of such defining moments\r\nthere comes the resolve to learn the lessons of history,\r\nto change the existing order and to make sure the\r\ncalamities of the past can never happen again.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nIn the heat and clarity of the immediate aftermath\r\nof such events, expressions of resolve are abundant.\r\nAnd yet, from the examples I have just outlined, it is\r\nclear that in the past our resolve has faltered as the\r\nimmediate threat receded and that the determination\r\nrequired to tackle the underlying causes and injustices\r\nthat give rise to conflict has proved difficult to sustain.\r\nToday the international community is again at a\r\ncrossroads. If we want a true and lasting victory over\r\ninternational terrorism; if we want safety, security and\r\nprosperity for our own people and our children, then\r\nwe must act with sustained resolve and sustained\r\ndetermination.\r\nOur immediate agenda is clear. Action against\r\nterrorism must be pursued resolutely across a wide\r\nfront and over a sustained period. In undertaking this\r\nnecessary endeavour, let us be honest and realistic.\r\nWith retributive justice must come distributive justice.\r\nThe peace and security which we crave for ourselves\r\nand for future generations will not be secured unless\r\nwe simultaneously tackle the root causes of conflict:\r\ninjustice, poverty and the abuse of fundamental rights\r\nand freedoms.\r\nToo often, multilateral action has been\r\ncharacterized as reaction to the outcomes of conflict.\r\nLast years Millennium Declaration confirmed the\r\npublic commitment of the worlds leadership to\r\nresolving also the root causes of conflict. The United\r\nNations was created out of the determination to tackle\r\nconflict and its causes. On that basis, let us this week\r\nrecommit and rededicate ourselves to the achievement\r\nof the goals and objectives of the United Nations. As\r\nthe Secretary-General pointed out when opening this\r\ngeneral debate, none of the issues that faced us on 10\r\nSeptember has become less urgent.\r\nWe must act more resolutely through the United\r\nNations, with sustained commitment and sustained\r\ndetermination, to address this equally urgent agenda.\r\nWe must implement with determination all Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. Let us realize and build on the\r\npledges we made at the Millennium Summit. Let us\r\nstrive much more effectively to control the spread of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. Let us also improve the\r\nworking of this Organization by making it more\r\nefficient, adaptable and coordinated. In the words of\r\nthe Secretary-General this week, let us ensure that\r\nwhen the United Nations acts, only the best is good\r\nenough. Only in this way will the United Nations and\r\nits Member States succeed in overcoming the massive\r\nchallenges which now confront us.\r\nIn addressing this comprehensive agenda, we\r\nmust not relax our efforts on human rights. This\r\nOrganization was founded out of a determination to\r\nassert human rights, the dignity and worth of the\r\nhuman person and the equal rights of men and women.\r\nWe must not equivocate on any of these principles. In\r\npursuit of this, Ireland looks forward to the imminent\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\r\nappeals for its universal recognition.\r\nViolent conflict and internal strife are the reality\r\nof daily life in many regions and countries across the\r\nworld today  the Middle East, the Great Lakes region\r\nof Africa and many other places, such as Sudan, where\r\npeople are being killed and maimed. Ireland has\r\nworked hard since joining the Security Council last\r\nJanuary to focus on the need to address these and other\r\nconflicts. We have given particular attention to Africa\r\nand to the efforts, frequently African-led, to solve the\r\nmany conflicts there. We have consistently sought to\r\nhighlight the humanitarian aspects of the various\r\nsituations coming before the Council. We were\r\nparticularly gratified during our presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council last month to have presided over\r\nsubstantial discussions on Somalia and on the United\r\nNations support for post-independence East Timor.\r\nWe remain concerned about the humanitarian\r\nsituation of the people of Iraq. The Iraqi Government\r\ncan and must do more within the system set out in the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions to meet the humanitarian\r\nneeds of its own people. For its part, the Security\r\nCouncil and its members must redouble their efforts to\r\nreach agreement on the outcome of its review of the\r\nsanctions regime. But we must not lose sight of the\r\nfundamental purpose of the sanctions regime: Iraq must\r\nallow verification that it has met its essential\r\ndisarmament obligations.\r\nThe Irish Government is grateful to those\r\nMember States that supported Irelands membership in\r\nthe Security Council. We will continue to strive to\r\nvindicate the confidence that you placed in us.\r\nThe United Nations role in peacekeeping has\r\nbeen at the heart of our collective endeavours now for\r\nover 50 years. Ireland has played a proud part in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping across the continents.\r\nThis evening, I want to take a moment to thank the\r\nIrish soldiers who have served with such distinction\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nand dedication in Lebanon for the last 23 years. The\r\nlast Irish battalion leaves the United Nations Interim\r\nForce in Lebanon tomorrow. The people of Ireland are\r\nproud of their service and achievements in the cause of\r\npeace. I want to pay special tribute to the memory of\r\nthose soldiers who lost their lives in the service of\r\npeace.\r\nIrelands commitment to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping remains undiminished. We continue to\r\nparticipate in about a dozen missions. A new\r\ncontingent of our troops will soon begin service with\r\nthe United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea.\r\nWe must equally give priority to achieving\r\nsustainable development and meeting the humanitarian\r\nchallenges that confront us. The United Nations\r\nPopulation Funds 2001 The State of World Population\r\nreport, published last week, reminds us that half of the\r\nworlds 6.1 billion people still exist on less than $2 per\r\nday and forecasts that the world population will rise by\r\n50 per cent, to 9.3 billion, by the year 2050. Is it\r\nacceptable that over 3 billion people are today living in\r\ntotal and abject poverty, while the developed world is\r\nstruggling to come to terms with the problems of over-\r\nconsumption and environmental pollution? Are we\r\nprepared to accept that there could be over 6 billion\r\npeople living in poverty by 2050?\r\nLet us see every Government set out its\r\ncommitment to reach the target of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product for development assistance within the\r\nnext five years. Ireland has already made it clear that it\r\nwill deliver on its commitment in this regard and will\r\nincrease its overseas development aid budget by over\r\n$100 million next year to keep on track towards this\r\ntarget. Let us reassess the sustainable debt levels and\r\nprovide additional relief to the heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries of sub-Saharan Africa, which will suffer the\r\nmost in the present economic downturn.\r\nLet us redouble our efforts to overcome an\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic which is killing over 6.5\r\nthousand people every day in Africa and which has\r\nalready orphaned over 9 million children on that\r\ncontinent. The Declaration of Commitment agreed at\r\nthe General Assembly special session in June has\r\nestablished the framework and the targets. It now has\r\nto be financed and implemented.\r\nLet us work harder together to prevent climate\r\nchange from devastating poor and vulnerable countries.\r\nWe have achieved much already. This is\r\nrecognized by the awarding of this years Nobel Peace\r\nPrize jointly to our Organization and to our esteemed\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan. I offer my warmest\r\ncongratulations and appreciation to Kofi Annan, and to\r\nall who serve the United Nations. But the Secretary-\r\nGeneral would be the first to emphasize that the award\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize must be seen not only as a\r\nrecognition of past achievement, but as an inspiration\r\nto renewed commitment and determination.\r\nThe terrible events of 11 September, which struck\r\nmost fiercely at the city of New York  seat of the\r\nUnited Nations and melting pot of all races and\r\ncreeds  brought home to us all that the collective\r\nsecurity of the international community is only as\r\nstrong as its weakest link. As long as a single\r\nGovernment or, in the case of the Taliban, a single de\r\nfacto administration, is prepared to allow its territory to\r\nbe used as a base for terrorist attacks against people\r\nanywhere on this planet, we can never feel secure.\r\nWe must confront and defeat the scourge of\r\ninternational terrorism and bring those responsible for\r\nthe barbaric acts of 11 September to justice, not out of\r\na need for revenge, but because the perpetrators of\r\nthese acts are capable of repeating such attacks and\r\nmake no secret of their determination to do so. They\r\ncan and must be stopped.\r\nIrelands position has been steadfast and clear: we\r\nstand with the United States and with the rest of the\r\ninternational community in asserting that the barbarism\r\nof 11 September cannot be allowed to succeed; that the\r\nthreat posed by international terrorism must be\r\npermanently ended; and that there must be a total\r\ncommitment by all Governments to this task, with all\r\nthe energy and resources at our disposal.\r\nMy Government hopes that the military campaign\r\nnow under way will achieve its objectives in as short a\r\ntime frame as possible. Every effort must continue to\r\nbe made to avoid civilian casualties, and it is crucial\r\nthat the military campaign be accompanied by a visible\r\nand effective humanitarian strategy. The long-suffering\r\npeople of Afghanistan deserve no less. There must also\r\nbe a concerted international effort, coordinated by the\r\nUnited Nations, to assist the people of Afghanistan in\r\nestablishing a broad-based Government, representative\r\nof all the ethnic groups which make up the country.\r\nThis must be accompanied by a comprehensive and\r\ngenerous programme of support for the post-military\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan. The\r\ninternational community must stay engaged once a\r\nrepresentative Government is established there.\r\nIn Ireland, we continue to make steady progress\r\nwith our own peace process. As representatives will be\r\naware, the British and Irish Governments and the\r\npolitical parties in Northern Ireland successfully\r\nnegotiated a comprehensive peace settlement over three\r\nyears ago, known as the Good Friday Agreement. Since\r\nthen, we have worked hard to secure the full\r\nimplementation of this Agreement.\r\nTwo of the most difficult and sensitive issues we\r\nhave had to face were the putting of paramilitary\r\nweapons beyond use and the putting in place of a new\r\nbeginning to policing. I am very pleased to be able to\r\ninform the Assembly that very considerable progress\r\nhas recently been made on both these crucial issues. As\r\na result, the way is now clear for a sustained,\r\ncommitted and enthusiastic implementation of all\r\nelements of the Good Friday Agreement.\r\nWe have learned a lot from our own voyage\r\ntowards peace. We have put in place new constitutional\r\nand institutional arrangements, which fully recognize\r\nand respect the legitimacy of both political traditions\r\non the island of Ireland. We have established the\r\nprimacy and full relevance of politics in peoples lives\r\nin Northern Ireland. We do not pretend, of course, that\r\nwe have found a solution that has universal\r\napplication  we know too well how local and\r\nindividual conflicts can be. But through our own\r\nprocess of trial and error we have learned lessons and\r\nestablished principles that may be useful in resolving\r\nconflicts in other parts of the world. From our own\r\nexperience of peace-building, we enumerate the most\r\nimportant elements of any truly sustainable peace\r\nprocess as follows.\r\nThere can be no purely military solution. A\r\nlasting settlement must always address the root causes\r\nof conflict. Compromise is essential. Recognizing that\r\nextremism breeds in the absence of reason, conflict\r\nresolution demands that we rehabilitate the concept of\r\ncompromise. In the context of effective political\r\ndialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes,\r\npeacemakers should not regard compromise as\r\nrepresenting appeasement or surrender, victory or\r\ndefeat. Neither does compromise necessarily require\r\nsplitting the difference between the parties. A lasting\r\nagreement must be comprehensive and address all\r\nissues of concern, even if the parties might agree to\r\ndeal with them in different time frames.\r\nThose in favour of peace in each community must\r\nwork together, even in the face of hostility from the\r\nenemies of the peace process in their own community.\r\nThey must stick together in adversity. They must avoid\r\nexcessive and damaging criticism when mistakes are\r\nmade, as they inevitably will be. They must be\r\nprepared to face down the enemies of peace together.\r\nThe international community must support the\r\npeace process in a balanced and objective way. A\r\nsuccessful process needs a route map, such as those\r\nalready prepared by Mitchell and Tenet in the context\r\nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also needs a\r\nmechanism to arbitrate on who is meeting, and who is\r\nnot meeting, their commitments under any such\r\narrangements.\r\nThose driving the peace process must rise above\r\nthe politics of the last atrocity. Not doing so, while\r\nunderstandable in terms of domestic opinion, is\r\nultimately bereft of vision and hands control over\r\nprogress to the enemies of the process. There is a\r\nparticularly compelling message here for those charged\r\nwith advancing the peace process in the Middle East. If\r\nthese elements are present, we believe a peace process\r\ncan prosper.\r\nAs I have already said, there is no one size fits\r\nall solution to conflict. I believe, however, that if\r\nthese principles were to be applied in certain other\r\nconflict situations, they could make a significant\r\ncontribution to the achievement of peace and political\r\nprogress.\r\nThe world we seek cannot be brought about\r\novernight. Building peace, ensuring justice, widening\r\nrespect for fundamental human rights and eliminating\r\npoverty will take time. We will require stamina,\r\ndetermination, inspiration, patience, generosity and\r\ncompromise. We have all these qualities in abundance\r\nif only we can find the political will to use them and\r\nthe determination, together, to seek new ways forward.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Fathulla Jameel, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Maldives.\r\nMr. Jameel (Maldives): It gives me great\r\npleasure, on behalf of my country, to congratulate\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly. His election to that high office\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ndemonstrates the international communitys respect for\r\nand confidence in his ability to guide the work of this\r\nsession successfully. It also demonstrates the trust and\r\nhigh regard that the international community has for\r\nthe Republic of Korea and for the important role that\r\ncountry is playing in the international arena to foster\r\npeace and security in the world. I would also like to\r\ntake this opportunity to pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for the\r\nexemplary manner in which he guided the work of the\r\nfifty-fifth session.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, on his\r\nreappointment to head the Organization for a second\r\nterm. His dynamic leadership has earned the United\r\nNations the confidence of the international community\r\nand has raised fresh hopes about the Organizations\r\nability to facilitate a world atmosphere more conducive\r\nto peace, justice and human dignity as we enter the\r\ntwenty-first century. The award of the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize to the Secretary-General and to the United\r\nNations is testimony to that confidence.\r\nNearly 13 years ago, the Maldives woke up to the\r\nhorrors of terrorism when a band of foreign terrorists\r\nattacked Male, our capital island, without the slightest\r\nwarning or provocation, killing many innocent people\r\nand destroying property. By their faceless act of\r\nviolence, they changed the peaceful life we had had in\r\nour country for centuries into one full of fear and\r\napprehension.\r\nOn 11 September this year, the most powerful\r\ncountry, the United States of America, itself became a\r\ntarget and the victim of a horrendous act of terrorism.\r\nThe world community was shocked and promptly\r\ncondemned the barbaric attacks on the World Trade\r\nCenter and the Pentagon, and the murder of thousands\r\nof innocent people. Consistent with its stand against\r\nterrorism, the Maldives found itself among the first\r\nStates to condemn those attacks in the strongest\r\npossible terms.\r\nThe tragedy of 11 September has reminded us\r\nthat terrorism is one of the biggest challenges facing\r\nthe world community today. It has emerged as an\r\nenemy of nations, be they large or small, and as a\r\nvicious threat to humanity. In combating such a cruel\r\nenemy, it is important that international action against\r\nterrorism be supported and that it be complemented by\r\nmeasures at the regional and national levels.\r\nAt the international level, the legal doctrine\r\nagainst all aspects of terrorism must be strengthened\r\nand universalized. Concomitantly, action at the\r\nregional and national levels must be brought into line\r\nwith international obligations in fighting this global\r\nmenace. The United Nations, as the global organization\r\nresponsible for international peace and security, must\r\nplay the pivotal role in this fight against terrorism. My\r\ncountry fully supports the early convening of a high-\r\nlevel conference, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, to formulate a clear definition of terrorism and\r\nto draw up a joint, far-sighted reaction to the ever-\r\ngrowing phenomena of terrorism in its various forms\r\nand manifestations. We are also looking forward to the\r\nearly conclusion of a comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism and of an international\r\nconvention for the prevention of acts of terrorism using\r\nnuclear, biological or chemical material or agents.\r\nAs a people who have devoted themselves to the\r\npractice of Islamic faith and values for nearly a\r\nmillennium, we are deeply offended by the notion that\r\nterrorism is linked to Islam or to Muslims. On the\r\ncontrary, Islam advocates peace, compassion, tolerance\r\nand peaceful coexistence. The projection and portrayal\r\nof Islam as an enemy of civilization or of the free\r\nworld is an insult to its noble principles. It is a\r\nperverted view and a falsification of Islam and its\r\nprinciples. Such perversions are nothing but\r\npropaganda hatched by evil people who wish to breed\r\nhatred among human beings; their claims are no less\r\nharmful than terrorism itself.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit last year, our leaders\r\ncharted a course for a better world, a world in which\r\nthe whole of humanity can prosper in mutual respect\r\nand dignity. Navigating smoothly along that course will\r\nbe a difficult task. We have to be ready to boldly\r\naddress the challenges in our way.\r\nOver the past year, we met in several special\r\nsessions to address some specific important issues. On\r\neach and every such occasion, we demonstrated our\r\nfirm resolve to uphold the objectives set forth in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. The major cross-cutting\r\ntheme that runs deep in all these issues is the\r\ndehumanizing scourge of poverty. Poverty remains the\r\nmajor stumbling block for sustainable social and\r\neconomic development in the developing world.\r\nEradicating poverty, therefore, is core to the attainment\r\nof peace and development. Let us therefore make the\r\nelimination of poverty our top priority and pursue\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nvigorously the target set by our leaders during the\r\nMillennium Summit: to halve poverty by 2015.\r\nThe commitments we have undertaken at such\r\nconferences involve high price tags. Unless new and\r\nadditional financial resources are made available in a\r\ntimely and predictable manner, no action plans or\r\nprogrammes can be implemented. It is therefore a\r\ncollective responsibility of the entire international\r\ncommunity, including the private-sector stakeholders\r\nand civil society, to muster the necessary political will\r\nthat is so vital in this regard. We are eagerly looking\r\nforward to the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development to be held in Mexico early next year.\r\nWe hope that that event will provide the international\r\ncommunity with an opportunity to agree on new,\r\ninnovative and additional sources and strategies to\r\nmobilize funds for development.\r\nGlobalization is now a reality. Many in the\r\ndeveloped world are enjoying the unprecedented yield\r\nof globalization, while its powerful forces are\r\ndepressing the fragile economies of many developing\r\nand least developed countries, including structurally\r\nweak countries. The uneven playing field has indeed\r\ncontributed to widening the gap between the rich and\r\nthe poor. In fact, the obstacles to the development of\r\nthe least developed countries have grown in number\r\nand magnitude over the years and have marginalized\r\nthose countries in the world economy. My country, the\r\nMaldives, is heartened by the goodwill and solidarity\r\nextended by the international community to the least\r\ndeveloped countries during the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries held in\r\nBrussels early this year. It is now time for delivery on\r\nthe commitments made at the Brussels Conference.\r\nUnless those commitments are fulfilled, the plight of\r\nthe least developed countries will continue to worsen.\r\nThe special circumstances and needs of the small\r\nisland developing States (SIDS) have been recognized\r\nand acknowledged by this Assembly on numerous\r\noccasions. The Barbados Programme of Action very\r\nclearly spells out these special needs of SIDS.\r\nAlthough many SIDS may appear to be relatively more\r\nprosperous on the basis of per capita income level, it is\r\nalso a documented fact that, due to the special\r\ncharacteristics of small islands, they are generally\r\namong the most economically vulnerable and\r\nhandicapped countries in the world today.\r\nAs a country with little more than a quarter of a\r\nmillion inhabitants spread over more than 200 islands,\r\nbereft of natural resources and with a fragile economy\r\nbased on fisheries and tourism, which are sensitive to\r\nthe harsh realities of ecology and the environment, the\r\nMaldives provides a perfect example of this dilemma\r\nof the small island developing States.\r\nThe stable political environment that the\r\nMaldives has enjoyed for the past two decades,\r\ncombined with the continued flow of assistance from\r\nour development partners, have indeed given us the\r\nopportunity to improve the quality of life of our\r\npeople. Our efforts towards development have\r\nremained relentless, as the structural constraints we\r\nface are both persistent and formidable.\r\nGiven these realities, my country is convinced\r\nthat the present criteria for identifying least developed\r\ncountries need to be refined to reflect the impediments\r\nin full. We appeal to the Committee for Development\r\nPolicy and the international community to consider\r\nthese realities on the ground and to look beyond\r\nabstract indicators into the inherent vulnerabilities of\r\nsmall island developing States in determining the\r\ncriteria for graduation.\r\nWe do not wish to remain indefinitely in the\r\ncategory of least developed countries. However, should\r\ngraduation be thrust upon us prematurely, its negative\r\nconsequences could easily overwhelm us and result in\r\nserious erosion of our achievements. We need to\r\nstrengthen the capacity of our human resources and\r\ninstitutions to cope with existing and emerging\r\nchallenges to our development efforts. We need to find\r\nways and means to diversify our economic base and\r\nstrengthen its sustainability.\r\nWe welcome the recent resolution adopted by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to extend our transition\r\nperiod until the next triennial review of the list of least\r\ndeveloped countries in 2003. At the same time, we\r\nwish to reiterate our belief that ensuring a smooth\r\ntransition for graduating countries, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 46/206, is an essential\r\nobligation of the entire international community.\r\nIndeed, a decision that affects the future destiny of a\r\nnation should not be based on hastily compiled\r\ninformation that may contain erroneous assumptions\r\nand dubious facts that could mislead the competent\r\nauthorities, leading them to reach questionable\r\nconclusions.\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nThe state of the global environment remains a\r\nmajor concern of the international community. A\r\ndecade after the adoption of Agenda 21, its effective\r\nimplementation has proven to be a difficult task. The\r\npleas of small island developing States for new and\r\nadditional resources to implement the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action remain to be heeded. The Kyoto\r\nProtocol is yet to come into force. Meanwhile,\r\nscientific predictions on the future of the global\r\nenvironment remain alarming. Unless swift and\r\nconcrete action is forthcoming, global environmental\r\ndegradation will continue to threaten the survival of\r\nhumankind and our planet. The consequences of a mere\r\none-metre rise in the mean sea level on small island\r\ndeveloping States, such as the Maldives, is now a well-\r\ndocumented fact. We, therefore, urge the international\r\ncommunity to accelerate its efforts to agree on a legally\r\nbinding greenhouse gas emissions reduction regime\r\nand to facilitate the Kyoto Protocols early entry into\r\nforce. In this connection, we are encouraged by the\r\npositive developments achieved in Marrakech last\r\nweek and hope that these developments will facilitate\r\nan early entry into force of the Protocol.\r\nA year from now, we will gather in Johannesburg,\r\nSouth Africa, for the Rio + 10 Summit to take stock of\r\nour labour over the past decade to protect and preserve\r\nthe global environment. My country believes that this\r\nwould be an excellent opportunity for the international\r\ncommunity to reinvigorate its efforts and rededicate its\r\ncommitments to protect and preserve the global\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe Maldives attaches great importance to the\r\nefforts of the international community to foster\r\nsustainable social development. The five-year review\r\nof the Copenhagen commitments and Beijing Platform\r\nfor Action, carried out last year, and the recently\r\nconcluded review of the implementation of the\r\noutcome of the Second United Nations Conference on\r\nHuman Settlements (Habitat Agenda), as well as the\r\nWorld Conference against Racism and Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\r\nhave added renewed impetus to the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to achieve social harmony.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a major\r\nimpediment to social development. The Maldives, too,\r\nhas not been immune to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nAlthough the number of cases may be relatively low in\r\nour country, we are fully aware of the potential threat\r\nthat looms over us. We pledge our full support to the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted by the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly on HIV/AIDS early this year,\r\nand we call on the international community, including\r\nthe private sector stakeholders, to commit the financial\r\nresources required to implement the Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nMy country wholeheartedly supports the just\r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people. My country\r\ncommends the efforts of the co-sponsors of the Middle\r\nEast peace process to help put the talks back on track.\r\nWe strongly believe that the Mitchell report should be\r\nimplemented urgently to pave the way for restarting the\r\nstalled peace process.\r\nDisarmament and arms control measures continue\r\nto remain a high priority on the international agenda.\r\nWhile we were encouraged by the positive outcome of\r\nthe NPT Review Conference last year, we would like to\r\nreiterate the need for continuing efforts to strengthen\r\nand enforce the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nSimilarly, we look forward to the day when the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) will\r\ncome into force.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm the firm\r\ncommitment of the Maldives to the principles and\r\nobjectives enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We\r\nwill work with the other members of the international\r\ncommunity to uphold and promote these lofty\r\nobjectives. We remain convinced that the United\r\nNations is the only organization that is capable of\r\ncreating a more peaceful and prosperous world for\r\nhumanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Josep Piqué, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Spain.\r\nMr. Piqué (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): First of\r\nall, I would like to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on\r\nhis election as President of this fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations. Likewise,\r\nI would like to congratulate the Organization itself and\r\nits Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on having been\r\nawarded this years Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Annans\r\nre-election guarantees the continuous leadership of\r\nsomeone who has enormously contributed to\r\nstrengthening the prestige of the United Nations and its\r\nrole in the world.\r\nI also wish to emphasize my full support for the\r\nstatement made in this Hall by the Minister for Foreign\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nAffairs of Belgium on behalf of the presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe horror of the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember shocked the world. We were all attacked on\r\nthat day  all of us who defend freedom, tolerance and\r\nrespect for the dignity of human beings. Spain knows\r\nwell the cruelty of terrorism and the grief that it can\r\ncause. Therefore, Spain, its Government and its\r\ncitizens are in complete solidarity with the American\r\npeople, the families of the victims and this city of New\r\nYork, which is also our city  the city of the United\r\nNations.\r\nOnce again, I wish to express my solidarity and\r\nmy condolences to the families of the victims of\r\ntodays tragedy.\r\nAfter 11 September, we cannot continue acting in\r\nthe same way. There has been change in the political\r\nparadigm  the coordinates that have guided us until\r\nnow. The paradigm has changed, and now the political\r\nculture must also change. Terrorism cannot continue to\r\nbe regarded as an inevitable evil for our peoples, but\r\nrather as a mortal enemy of them all. There can be\r\nneither excuses nor pretexts: this is the time to\r\ndemonstrate the political will of each and every one of\r\nus to take effective measures for international\r\ncooperation against terrorism  measures which Spain\r\nhas been promoting for years  to take a qualitative\r\nleap forward.\r\nSince 11 September, an important international\r\nconsensus has emerged on the need to confront\r\nterrorism. This shows that terrorism has nothing to do\r\nwith the differences between North and South or East\r\nand West, much less with a supposed conflict between\r\ncivilizations. Many Islamic countries are among its\r\nmain victims. It does have to do, however, with the\r\ndifference between those who commit these kinds of\r\nacts or give them their support, and those who consider\r\nthem to be atrocities and violations of the most\r\nelementary principles of human coexistence, which are\r\ncommon to all the great civilizations.\r\nThe United Nations has risen to the occasion. Its\r\naction has been quick and effective, demonstrating that\r\nthe Organization is indispensable at the dawning of the\r\nnew millennium. Resolution 1368 (2001) made it\r\npossible for a coalition of wills, of which Spain is a\r\npart, to emerge in order to respond to the attacks.\r\nResolution 1373 (2001) expresses the determination of\r\nthe international community to maintain concerted\r\naction for as long as necessary against terrorism:\r\nagainst terrorism without adjectives, against the\r\nterrorists themselves, and also against those who lend\r\nthem any type of support, active or passive.\r\nProgress has also been made in the negotiation of\r\na general convention against international terrorism,\r\novercoming some of the obstacles that had blocked the\r\nnegotiations for years. Now that we are close to\r\nreaching an agreement, we must make an effort to\r\neliminate the problems that are still pending. The goal\r\nmust be to draw up an operative and effective\r\ninstrument against terrorism that cannot be paralysed\r\nby interminable discussions of a political rather than a\r\nlegal nature. The subject is of pivotal importance, and\r\nthe very credibility of the United Nations is at stake.\r\nWe have a historical opportunity before us; it would be\r\na shame if we were to squander it.\r\nTo their cynicism and disdain for elementary\r\nhuman values, terrorists often add a shameless\r\nopportunism in order to manipulate particular\r\nsituations to their advantage. These situations\r\nundoubtedly require a solution on account of their\r\nintrinsic nature, on their own merits, without any\r\nrelation to terrorist claims. We must all work together\r\nto find that solution.\r\nThese situations involve structural problems such\r\nas poverty and the marginalization in which many\r\nmillions of people live all over the world. They also\r\nhave to do with regional conflicts, such as that in the\r\nMiddle East, where there is an urgent need to stop the\r\nblind cycle of violence and return to the negotiating\r\ntable. If the political will exists, negotiations are\r\npossible. Madrid, Oslo and the advances made at Camp\r\nDavid and Taba prove this. There is no alternative to\r\nthe peace process and, at the end of the road, the State\r\nof Israel and the Palestinian State will coexist\r\npeacefully within secure borders.\r\nTerrorist attacks against innocent civilians cause\r\nalarm among our peoples, but they are not the only\r\ncause for uncertainty at the beginning of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nWhen the political and ideological confrontations\r\nthat had defined the second half of the twentieth\r\ncentury were largely overcome, other types of conflicts\r\nemerged with force. These tend to be not international,\r\nbut rather internal, conflicts and are therefore difficult\r\nto address with the instruments of traditional\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ndiplomacy. Some of them have given rise to serious\r\nhumanitarian crises that have afflicted our peoples.\r\nAt a time when we have decoded the human\r\ngenome and the advances of biotechnology pose new\r\ndilemmas, millions of people continue to live in\r\nconditions of extreme poverty, with less than a dollar\r\nper day to cover all their needs.\r\nAs we witness the interconnection of economies\r\nworldwide and can send information instantly to any\r\ncorner of the Earth, we see how globalization\r\ndistributes its benefits unequally, making more visible\r\nand intolerable the breach between rich and poor, the\r\npowerful and the weak, the haves and the have-nots.\r\nThese situations give rise to uncertainty, but they\r\nalso give rise to a demand for solutions. Our peoples\r\nturn to us  Governments and international\r\norganizations  and they ask us to act, especially the\r\nUnited Nations. Its global vision, its universal\r\ncomposition and its vocation to defend the interests of\r\nall humanity give it a unique legitimacy in the eyes of\r\nour citizens.\r\nIn order not to disappoint these expectations, the\r\nUnited Nations must face the challenge of its\r\nmodernization, following the path charted by the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nMy country has also undergone a significant\r\nprocess of modernization in recent years, which has\r\nenabled it to become fully incorporated into\r\ninternational life. Spain has been able to break away\r\nfrom the inertia of the past and seek new solutions to\r\nits new problems. It has done so without renouncing its\r\nidentity as a bridge between different cultures and\r\nregions of the world. That is the perspective from\r\nwhich my country backs the process of reform and\r\nmodernization. It will continue to do so from the\r\npresidency of the European Union, which it will hold\r\nduring the first half of next year.\r\nThe phenomenon of globalization is responsible\r\nfor much of the current uncertainty facing the\r\nprocesses of change. The United Nations, which thinks\r\nglobally, is the natural forum for managing\r\nglobalization.\r\nIn addition to the fight against terrorism, effective\r\ninstruments must be developed to combat drugs and\r\ntransnational organized crime. This year, progress must\r\nbe made in the preparation of a convention against\r\ncorruption.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is one of the\r\nkey instruments of international relations that we will\r\nneed in the new millennium. Spain has been involved\r\nfrom the start in the fight against the culture of\r\nimpunity with regard to the most heinous crimes. It\r\nnow seems more necessary than ever for the Court to\r\nstart to act. The different legal systems of the world\r\nmust be duly represented in the court, because\r\nglobalization does not mean homogenization. No\r\ncountry must be marginalized from this historic\r\nprocess; all must be able to contribute to the Court\r\ntheir own views regarding international criminal\r\njustice.\r\nArms control, disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nrequire greater attention from the international\r\ncommunity. Progress in the destruction and prohibition\r\nof anti-personnel mines as a result of the Ottawa\r\nConvention and the results of the Programme of Action\r\nof the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects are\r\nencouraging.\r\nThe need to protect the environment is real, and\r\nthe solutions cannot be postponed. The Kyoto Protocol\r\noffers some answers to this problem. Those who do not\r\naccept Kyoto will have to propose a better solution. In\r\nthe meantime, its ratification will be the only practical\r\nmeasure taken in this field. That is why we welcome\r\nthe agreement reached in Marrakech, which we believe\r\nto be a step in the right direction.\r\nNew conflicts require new solutions. We must\r\ndeal with all the stages of a particular conflict through\r\na comprehensive approach that includes efforts to\r\nprevent the causes, to keep the peace when crisis\r\nerupts, to consolidate that peace and, afterwards, to\r\nbegin economic and institutional reconstruction. This\r\nidea has inspired the efforts being made by my country,\r\nin cooperation with the Russian Federation, in the\r\ndemining project in southern Lebanon. It also\r\nmotivates efforts, in which Spain is an active\r\nparticipant, to strengthen African capabilities to\r\nprevent and settle conflicts. For that reason, Spain was\r\nvery pleased to welcome the birth of the African Union\r\nat the Lusaka Summit, as well as the New African\r\nInitiative that was adopted there.\r\nThis approach must also be applied to\r\ninternational action in support of the Afghan people,\r\nwhose situation is particularly dire. We must urgently\r\nhelp them to meet their basic humanitarian needs,\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nespecially given the approach of winter. This\r\ninternational action, to which Spain is contributing,\r\nmust also include clear support for the economic and\r\ninstitutional reconstruction of the country. The future\r\nof Afghanistan is something that only the Afghan\r\npeople can decide. Nevertheless, the international\r\ncommunity must support them so that they can\r\nestablish a stable Government and maintain normal\r\nrelations with their neighbours and the rest of the\r\nworld. In this task, the United Nations must play a\r\nfundamental role.\r\nThe new diplomatic instruments that are required\r\nmust accord special attention to humanitarian affairs.\r\nThe need to protect the rights of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons, access to humanitarian assistance\r\nfor affected populations and the situation of children in\r\narmed conflicts, in addition to the security problem of\r\nUnited Nations and associated personnel  all these\r\nissues require effective solutions. If some States fail to\r\nmeet their responsibilities in this area, it will be\r\nnecessary to draw attention to their attitude repeatedly,\r\nuntil it changes.\r\nPeacekeeping is an essential instrument in this\r\ncomprehensive approach to dealing with conflict. The\r\nGeneral Assembly must take concrete steps to\r\nimplement the recommendations of the Brahimi report\r\non peacekeeping operations by increasing the size of\r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the\r\nSecretariat, improving the participation of the troop-\r\ncontributing countries in the decision-making process\r\nand strengthening civil police operations, in which\r\nSpain has played an active role.\r\nNone of this will be enough if peacekeeping\r\noperations do not receive clear and adequate mandates,\r\nbacked with the firm political support of the Security\r\nCouncil. If mandates are not clear and adequate, it will\r\nnot be possible to send United Nations units to places\r\nin which they may have to use force. No country is\r\nprepared to risk the lives of its soldiers to defend\r\nempty words.\r\nThis brings us to the need to conclude the process\r\nof reforming the Security Council. We need a more\r\nrepresentative, democratic, effective and transparent\r\nSecurity Council. Spain, which is a candidate for\r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council in\r\nthe elections to be held during the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly, will strive, if elected, to\r\nincrease the quantity and improve the quality of the\r\nconsultations with non-member States, especially with\r\nthose most affected by the issues being debated by the\r\nCouncil.\r\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms  civil\r\nand political, as well as economic and social  are the\r\nbirthright of all humanity and not just of a particular\r\ngroup of States. Their violation today provokes\r\ncondemnation in a way that it did not in the past. We\r\nmust continue to strengthen such points of agreement,\r\nincorporating the concerns of all.\r\nIt is therefore important that the Durban\r\nConference was able to adopt a final document. Spain,\r\nlike the rest of the European Union, upheld to the end\r\nits commitment to the objectives of the Conference. We\r\nmust take advantage of the agreement reached at\r\nDurban to continue to make progress in this field.\r\nAlong the same lines, my country will organize, in the\r\nnext few days in Madrid, in cooperation with the Office\r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights, an international consultative conference on\r\nstudent education in relation to freedom of religion or\r\nbeliefs, tolerance and non-discrimination.\r\nI cannot fail to refer to the question of Gibraltar.\r\nAs has already been communicated to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the United Kingdom and Spain agreed, on 26\r\nJuly in London, to relaunch their talks within the\r\nframework of the Brussels Declaration, issuing to this\r\nend a communiqué in which they underlined their\r\npolitical will to overcome all of their differences over\r\nGibraltar and to conclude these talks promptly and\r\nsuccessfully for the benefit of all the parties involved.\r\nFurthermore, they invited the Chief Minister of\r\nGibraltar to participate in ministerial meetings within\r\nthe framework of this process.\r\nThe problem of development is central to the\r\nactivities of the Organization. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration constitutes the basic framework for these\r\nactivities and must be implemented in its entirety. At\r\nthis session, the General Assembly must set in motion\r\nan effective monitoring mechanism for the Declaration.\r\nSpain is also working to define new fields for\r\ndevelopment cooperation. For example, Spain is a\r\npioneer in the development of microcredits, which\r\nconstitute a particularly suitable instrument for the\r\ndevelopment of the less advanced countries. This year,\r\nSpain organized in Las Palmas a high-level meeting on\r\ntourism and development in less developed countries\r\nwith a view to placing its extensive experience in this\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nfield at the service of tourism development in such\r\ncountries, some of which, such as the small island\r\nStates, have comparative advantages in this field from\r\nwhich they could benefit.\r\nNext April, Spain will also organize the Second\r\nWorld Assembly on Ageing, thus responding to the\r\nneed to pay special attention to vulnerable\r\npopulations  those most likely to suffer the highest\r\nrates of poverty. The eradication of poverty is the\r\nprimary objective of both the Millennium Declaration\r\nand Spains policy for cooperation in development.\r\nIf there is one group of people who are vulnerable\r\nby definition, it is people who are ill. The special\r\nsession of General Assembly on AIDS and other\r\ninfectious diseases highlighted the urgency of halting\r\ntheir spread. Spain will make a major contribution to\r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria, which has been created for this purpose.\r\nThe United Nations will not be able to\r\naccomplish all of these tasks if it does not have the\r\nnecessary resources to do so. The budget for the\r\ncoming two-year period will be discussed during this\r\nAssemblys session. The effort to impose budgetary\r\ndiscipline must continue, but rigid positions that\r\nprevent the Organization from facing up to its\r\nresponsibilities must be avoided.\r\nEvading responsibility is something that the\r\nUnited Nations cannot afford to do, especially today.\r\nUnique legitimacy imposes a unique responsibility. The\r\nUnited Nations will be judged in this new millennium\r\nby its effectiveness in addressing the new problems\r\nconfronting it, by its ability to transform uncertainties\r\ninto solutions, insecurity into confidence and fear into\r\nhope.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to make one further\r\ncomment. In his statement, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nreferred to the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and\r\nto other Spanish territories. In the context of the\r\nrelations of friendship and good-neighbourliness that\r\nexist between Spain and Morocco, I wish to stress that\r\nthe cities of Ceuta and Melilla, and the adjacent\r\nislands, are an integral part of the territory of Spain and\r\nthat their citizens are represented in the Spanish\r\nparliament in the same capacity and under the same\r\nterms as the rest of their compatriots.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Habib Ben Yahia, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I am\r\npleased to begin by extending to Mr. Han Seung-soo\r\nand through him to his friendly country, the Republic\r\nof Korea, our warmest congratulations on his election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsixth session. I wish him every success in his tasks\r\nduring the session. I would also like to convey our\r\nsincere thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nfor the skill and efficiency with which he conducted the\r\nwork of this Assembly during the past session.\r\nI am also pleased on behalf of my country to\r\nrenew our sincere congratulations to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan on his unanimous re-election to continue\r\nhis noble mission. We congratulate him and the United\r\nNations on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThis session is taking place at a time when the\r\nworld is anxious about the consequences of the\r\natrocious terrorist acts that struck the United States on\r\n11 September. We have strongly condemned these acts\r\nand reiterate our condolences to the friendly American\r\npeople and the families of the victims at this difficult\r\ntime. States were unanimous in the recently adopted\r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions in\r\nemphasizing the need to combat terrorism with all\r\ndetermination in order to uproot and prevent this\r\nscourge.\r\nSince the early 1990s, Tunisia has warned against\r\nthe dangers of terrorism. It has called for adopting the\r\nnecessary measures at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels to fight this phenomenon with all\r\navailable means. Today, we reiterate our earlier\r\nstatements. It is important to develop cooperation\r\namong States to fight terrorism, by taking all necessary\r\nand strong measures to implement Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). This should apply to those who\r\nabet directly or indirectly or are involved in\r\nperpetrating terrorist acts in their countries of origin or\r\nelsewhere. All acts of terrorism must be condemned\r\nwithout double standards, particularly with respect to\r\nthe granting of political asylum or residency. Tunisias\r\nbelief in the necessity of adopting such measures has\r\nspared it the presence of extremist elements and\r\nterrorism on its territory.\r\nIf we are to develop international cooperation in\r\nthis field, we will need to enhance approved legal\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nnorms. This can be done through a comprehensive\r\ninternational treaty allowing for a comprehensive plan\r\nof action. In the same vein, Tunisia supports the\r\nconvening of an international conference against\r\nterrorism. The conference would identify the legal\r\nframework and machinery needed to protect the\r\ninternational community from the dangers of this\r\nscourge.\r\nIn Tunisias view, the struggle against and\r\neventual elimination of terrorism requires the adoption\r\nof a comprehensive approach that makes prevention\r\nand the identification of the root causes of this\r\nphenomenon the bases of the methodology of\r\ninternational efforts. It is also necessary to consider the\r\ninternational circumstances that influence and promote\r\nthe increase in terrorism. This will allow us to find the\r\nappropriate approach to ending the spread of this\r\nphenomenon and its existence. In this context, it is\r\nimperative that we address all aspects that lead to\r\nfeelings of injustice, the absence of justice, deprivation\r\nand marginalization. This will prevent suspicious\r\nparties from exploiting these feelings to fuel extremism\r\nand terrorism. There is no doubt that the United\r\nNations and the General Assembly in particular have\r\nan effective role to play in clarifying that vision.\r\nAny comprehensive approach to fighting\r\nterrorism must stress the interdependence and\r\ninteraction between stability, security and peace, on the\r\none hand, and development and progress on the other.\r\nThe Millennium Summit, which brought together\r\nthe most important assembly of heads of State and\r\nGovernment in the history of our Organization and\r\nprovided a unique opportunity to discuss the state of\r\ninternational affairs in all its aspects, stressed that\r\nlinkage. It highlighted the need to formulate an\r\ninternational strategy and operational plans to achieve\r\nthe unanimously agreed objectives specified by the\r\nleaders for the next millennium.\r\nThis session is thus especially important in that it\r\nprovides an opportunity, a year later, to take stock of\r\nthe principles and objectives approved at the\r\nMillennium Summit. It also permits us to develop\r\nconcerted action based on these principles and\r\nobjectives. These include a common, cooperative and\r\nconsensual approach to the problems of our world, be\r\nthey issues of international peace and security or of\r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty.\r\nSolidarity, then, is imperative in the light of the\r\nmany challenges faced by mankind. In this context,\r\nPresident Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia has\r\nstressed before several regional forums, including the\r\nMillennium Summit and the Security Council summit,\r\nthe importance of solidarity in dealing with poverty,\r\nwhich is one source of tension and crises in societies.\r\nWe believe that we cannot guarantee stability and\r\nsecurity in the world without eliminating all forms of\r\npoverty, marginalization and alienation. In this context,\r\nPresident Ben Ali launched his appeal to establish a\r\nworld fund for solidarity towards the eradication of\r\npoverty.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I extend my sincere thanks to\r\nall parties that responded to this proposal and\r\nparticipated in the consultations held by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. In this regard, I cannot fail to commend the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to prepare a positive\r\nreport, which we hope will be the basis for establishing\r\nthe fund at this session. We have repeatedly affirmed\r\nthat the fund will not duplicate existing United Nations\r\nbodies concerned with fighting poverty; it will, instead,\r\ncomplement their efforts and provide a means of\r\nfinancing through voluntary contributions by\r\nindividuals, institutions or societies, in addition to\r\nGovernments. These contributions will be deposited in\r\nan account to be administered by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme.\r\nThere is no doubt that the strengthening of the\r\nfoundations of international peace and security is a task\r\nentrusted primarily to the Security Council, which in\r\nrecent weeks has proved particularly effective in its\r\nreaction to current developments. We hope that that\r\nimportant body will maintain the same effectiveness in\r\nseeking solutions to all international problems.\r\nFrom this perspective, developments in the\r\nMiddle East must take priority among the issues before\r\nthe Council. This is particularly important in view of\r\nthe continuing instability in the region caused by\r\nIsraels intransigence. We call on the Security Council,\r\nand especially its permanent members, to play an\r\neffective role so as to spare the Middle East from the\r\nspectre of an endless conflict, by urging Israel to take\r\nurgent measures to ensure the protection of the\r\nPalestinian people. Tunisia reaffirms its initiative,\r\ncalling for the protection of the Palestinian people\r\nthrough the deployment of international forces in the\r\nregion.\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nWe believe that the only viable option in the\r\nMiddle East today is a just, lasting and comprehensive\r\npeace that guarantees for the Palestinians the return of\r\ntheir land and their legitimate rights, foremost of which\r\nis their right to establish an independent State. In this\r\ncontext, Tunisia welcomes President Bushs\r\naffirmation before the General Assembly of the\r\nnecessity of establishing a Palestinian State. We also\r\nreiterate our position on the need for Israeli forces to\r\nleave Syrian and Lebanese territory.\r\nThe question of sanctions prompts us to examine\r\nour consciences in the light of the suffering it causes\r\ncivilians. We hope that there will be international\r\nconsensus to remove the sanctions against Iraq and to\r\ndeal with the humanitarian issue of missing Kuwaitis\r\nand persons from third countries. It is also time once\r\nand for all to lift the sanctions imposed against our\r\nsister country Libya, which has implemented all its\r\nobligations concerning the Lockerbie incident.\r\nAs a member of the region, Tunisia is working\r\ntowards more active participation in the Maghreb\r\nUnion, which aspires to integrate the States of the\r\nregion by enhancing the structure of the Union and\r\nguiding its work, given its function as a strategic\r\noption that reflects the will of the people of the region.\r\nTunisia is working to promote consultation and\r\ncooperation in the European-Mediterranean space on\r\nthe basis of equality, mutual respect, protection of the\r\ninterests of all parties and respect for their\r\nparticularities. The aim is to bring about the solid\r\ndevelopment of the peoples of the two shores of the\r\nMediterranean so as to achieve greater security and\r\nstability in the region.\r\nFaithful to its commitment to the African\r\ncontinent, Tunisia supports new initiatives for Africa\r\nand has joined the newly created African Union and\r\nwill support it with all our capabilities and experience.\r\nRespect for the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter only strengthens the action of the Organization\r\nin responding to the challenges of development and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In this\r\ncontext, we have to strengthen the role of the General\r\nAssembly, as an expression of the collective will of its\r\nMembers and as an embodiment of the concept of\r\ndemocracy in international relations.\r\nWith regard to the activities of the Security\r\nCouncil, Tunisia, throughout its term of office in the\r\nCouncil, has tried to strengthen the role of this organ\r\nby advocating consensus in dealing with the various\r\nitems on its agenda. This, in our view, will enhance the\r\nCouncils credibility and will reflect positively on its\r\nefficiency.\r\nDuring its presidency of the Council in February\r\n2001, Tunisia adopted a new comprehensive approach\r\nto dealing with various cases of instability and crises in\r\nthe world.\r\nTunisia put forward a proposal for holding a\r\ndebate on the subject Peace-building: towards a\r\ncomprehensive approach. The result of this debate\r\nwas a unanimous affirmation by members of the\r\nCouncil of the close connection between peace and\r\ndevelopment, of the preventive dimension of this\r\napproach and of the importance of solidarity in the\r\ninternational community when it comes to taking\r\nmeasures that are necessary for helping countries that\r\nare racked by tension and conflict.\r\nWithin this context, I must stress the need for the\r\nreform of the Security Council so as to expand its\r\nmembership of permanent and non-permanent seats on\r\nthe basis of equitable geographic distribution that will\r\nguarantee the interests of all countries, particularly the\r\ndeveloping countries. In contributing operationally to\r\nthe establishment of peace and security in the world,\r\nTunisia has participated in a number of peacekeeping\r\noperations such as its current participation in the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) headed\r\nby a Tunisian ambassador representing the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe elimination of weapons of mass destruction\r\nrepresents one of the major challenges facing\r\nhumanity. The importance of the establishment of\r\nzones free of weapons of mass destruction, particularly\r\nin the Middle East, is to be stressed in this context.\r\nTechnological and scientific advances have\r\ndwarfed distances and enabled mankind to score major\r\nachievements in numerous fields, such as spread of\r\nideas and bringing people closer to each other.\r\nDevelopment, however, has not benefited all peoples,\r\nparticularly developing countries. The widening of the\r\nquantitative gap between industrialized and developing\r\ncountries is a matter of concern. Concrete measures\r\nmust be taken to permit all countries to benefit from\r\nthe technological and information revolution. From this\r\nstandpoint, we would express the importance that\r\nTunisia places, since the International\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nTelecommunication Union (ITU) Conference in\r\nMinneapolis, on hosting the second phase of the World\r\nSummit on the Information Society in Tunisia in 2005.\r\nWe would like to express our gratitude to all countries\r\nthat have supported us in this. We would also like to\r\nexpress our thanks to Mr. Yoshio Utsumi, ITU\r\nSecretary-General, for his constructive role.\r\nWe hope that the General Assembly will adopt at\r\nthis session a resolution to begin preparations for this\r\nconference in its two phases. We also hope that the\r\nwork of this conference will lead to the establishment\r\nof a true and effective world information partnership\r\nbetween developed and developing countries.\r\nOur ability to meet challenges, which we are all\r\nfacing, including the fight against terrorism, depends\r\non our willingness to channel our efforts towards joint\r\naction, based on cooperation, solidarity, tolerance and\r\npartnership within the framework of our Organization,\r\nwhich is the ideal place for the realization of our\r\naspirations and for the benefit of all mankind.\r\nMrs. Mitreva (The former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): At the outset, allow me to convey our\r\ndeepest condolences to the American people and\r\nGovernment for todays plane crash and to express our\r\ndeepest sympathies to the families of the victims for\r\ntheir tragic loss. Our condolences also extend to the\r\npeople and Government of the Dominican Republic,\r\nwhose nationals comprised most of those on board.\r\nPleading for concerted action against terrorism\r\nand for urgent accession by States to all relevant\r\ninternational conventions, the Millennium Summit\r\nanticipated the need for more effective and\r\ncomprehensive joint efforts and cooperation. The tragic\r\nevents of 11 September united the world and reaffirmed\r\nthe resolve of all of us to fight the battle against\r\nterrorism, gathered around our common values and\r\ninterests. That unprecedented terrorist attack took place\r\nduring the United Nations Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations. The fatal message of terrorism is to\r\ndestroy the very essence of dialogue as a global\r\nresponse to conflict and violence.\r\nBy adopting several resolutions, the United\r\nNations demonstrated powerful solidarity and readiness\r\nto combat terrorism. Today that has been reaffirmed by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1377 (2001), which\r\nadopted a declaration on the global effort to combat\r\nterrorism.\r\nBy expressing its strong condemnation of the\r\nattacks and its solidarity with the American people and\r\nGovernment, my country, the Republic of Macedonia,\r\nimmediately joined the call to establish a global\r\ninternational anti-terrorist coalition. We undertook\r\nconcrete measures as our contribution to the global\r\nefforts and to cooperation to curb terrorist activities.\r\nAs a response to terrorism and conscious of the\r\nfact that terrorism transcends borders, we also\r\nproposed the establishment of a regional anti-terrorist\r\npact, stemming from our terrible experience with\r\nterrorism over the last eight months. We called upon\r\nthe international community to cut off financial support\r\nfor terrorist activities and, in that context, to strengthen\r\nthe fight against organized crime, aware of the strong\r\nlink between those evil phenomena. The resolution of\r\nregional conflicts is yet another significant contribution\r\nwe can make to the fight against terrorism.\r\nWith regard to relevant international instruments,\r\nwe believe that the existing United Nations\r\nconventions provide a solid international legal\r\nframework for the implementation of many measures\r\nintended to eradicate terrorism. While we strongly\r\nsupport the adoption of a comprehensive convention\r\nagainst terrorism and a consensus on a global definition\r\nof terrorism, their lack should not prevent us from\r\ntaking action.\r\nAction is needed now, from all of us  all\r\ncountries, regions and international organizations.\r\nThere is no alternative to international cooperation and\r\npartnership, as there is no alternative to the common\r\nfight against organized crime, which feeds terrorism.\r\nBut there is one matter we have to keep in mind:\r\ndifferent approaches towards acts of terrorism\r\nundermine our struggle. There is no big or small\r\nterrorism, nor international or domestic, nor one that is\r\ntolerated and one that is not. No one should be allowed\r\nto practice terror; the consequences are equally\r\ndevastating. We have to defend more vigorously than\r\never our shared values of democracy, human rights and\r\nthe rule of law. We must not allow ourselves to be\r\nmanipulated through the use of social, economic,\r\nreligious and political differences as justification for\r\nterrorism.\r\nFor the past 10 years the Republic of Macedonia\r\nhas developed a democratic society, a factor of stability\r\nin the Balkans. Our model of inter-ethnic relations was\r\nset out as an example and was applauded by the\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\ninternational community. Then, eight months ago,\r\nMacedonia was exposed to violent terrorist attacks that\r\nthreatened to undermine all our achievements. Under\r\nthe cloak of struggling for minority and human rights,\r\nthe so-called National Liberation Army (NLA) ─\r\nwhose structure, command and control and logistics are\r\nof Kosovo provenance ─ wanted to realize one aim: the\r\ndivision of Macedonia and changing the borders in the\r\nregion.\r\nOur response to those attacks was military,\r\npolitical and diplomatic. The Framework Agreement of\r\n13 August of this year, which was signed by the leaders\r\nof the four main political parties, is a result of our\r\nstrong commitment to finding a political solution to the\r\ncrisis as the best way to defend our country and\r\nundermine the goals of the terrorists. But let me\r\nreiterate that we will also defend our country by other\r\nmeans if necessary.\r\nThe cost of terrorism for Macedonia was high:\r\nlost lives, destroyed homes and thousand of refugees\r\nand internally displaced persons. The crisis also caused\r\neconomic downfall and a large budget deficit. It has\r\nhad a negative impact on the countrys development\r\nand has increased unemployment and poverty rates. I\r\ntherefore urge the international community, financial\r\ninstitutions and, in particular, the European Union to\r\naddress our needs at the upcoming donors conference\r\nand to consider the possibility of writing off our\r\nforeign debts.\r\nAt this point, allow me to underline that the\r\ninternational community gives strong political support\r\nto the Republic of Macedonia. The European Union,\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) and NATO are playing an important\r\nrole in overcoming the crisis, for which we are\r\ngrateful.\r\nI would also like to commend the prompt reaction\r\nby the Security Council. The awareness that the\r\nproblems in Macedonia were largely inspired in and\r\nimported from neighbouring Kosovo resulted in the\r\nadoption of resolution 1345 (2001), by which the\r\nCouncil, inter alia, strongly condemned extremist\r\nviolence, including terrorist activities, and supported\r\nthe Macedonian Government in its efforts to end the\r\nviolence in a manner consistent with the rule of law.\r\nOn 26 September the Council adopted resolution 1371\r\n(2001), which supported the full implementation of the\r\nFramework Agreement and rejected the use of violence\r\nin pursuit of political goals. Even though the United\r\nNations was not directly involved in the resolution of\r\nthe crisis in Macedonia, it is present on the ground\r\nthrough its agencies, working in cooperation with the\r\nGovernment to alleviate the consequences. We are\r\ngrateful for their help, too.\r\nDespite the efforts of the Republic of Macedonia\r\nand the international community, attempts are still\r\nbeing made to block the work of the parliament and to\r\nobstruct the implementation of the Framework\r\nAgreement. The latest events in the Tetovo area, the\r\ndeath of three policemen and the kidnapping of\r\nMacedonian civilians are proof that violence continues.\r\nWe should all condemn these obstacles to peace and\r\nstability. Macedonia is determined to pursue the path of\r\npeace and will not allow these events to blur our vision\r\nand detract us from our main goals of building a strong\r\ndemocracy at home and becoming integrated into Euro-\r\nAtlantic structures.\r\nThe recent history of crises has shown more than\r\never the importance of cooperation and solidarity\r\namong the countries of our region, and we have acted\r\naccordingly. The integration into the European Union\r\nand NATO is a common goal of all the countries in the\r\nregion of South-Eastern Europe. We are all aware that\r\nmembership is a solution to lasting stability and\r\nprosperity.\r\nWe are determined to contribute to the\r\nstrengthening of international peace and security, to\r\nenhancing international cooperation in all areas and to\r\nstrengthening the role of the United Nations. This year,\r\nthe Republic of Macedonia submitted, and the First\r\nCommittee adopted without a vote, a draft resolution\r\non the maintenance of international security  good-\r\nneighbourliness, stability and development in South-\r\nEastern Europe. That resolution was co-sponsored by\r\n46 Member States.\r\nThe struggle against terrorism must not deter us\r\nfrom taking up other important parts of the United\r\nNations agenda. At last years Millennium Summit we\r\nidentified the direction of future United Nations\r\nactivities to which we committed ourselves: the\r\neradication of poverty, the struggle against AIDS,\r\nconflict prevention and the protection of the\r\nenvironment. On this occasion, however, let me refer to\r\nthe matter of the rights and well-being of children, and\r\nin that context to reiterate the importance of the\r\nupcoming special session on children as a forum to\r\n40\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nreview the progress achieved and the further steps that\r\nneed to be taken for the benefit of children all over the\r\nworld.\r\nFurthermore, globalization remains one of the\r\nmost important issues on the international agenda. It is\r\nobvious that there are some essential problems that\r\nneed to be addressed immediately. In the new\r\nmillennium, it is crucial for the international\r\ncommunity to address the development agenda in a\r\nmore appropriate way. We believe that the United\r\nNations has a major role to play in this process. Next\r\nyears International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment are the most important events in this\r\nrespect, and we should all contribute as best we can to\r\ntheir successful outcome. Another important issue is\r\nthe launching of the new comprehensive trade\r\nnegotiations under World Trade Organization\r\npatronage, with special emphasis on the problems of\r\nmarginalization, sustainable development and\r\nimplementation of all multilateral environmental\r\nagreements.\r\nAfter 11 September, the world changed. We have\r\nto adjust to the new realities. There are many\r\nchallenges ahead of us, and the United Nations has to\r\nbe better prepared to deal with them. That will require\r\neven greater commitment on our part. The strength and\r\nthe success of our Organization depend on the resolve\r\nof all its Members to respond to the new realities in a\r\nmore efficient, relevant and adroit manner. We all have\r\nour part to play in this respect. This is the best\r\ncontribution we can make to building a better world for\r\nall of us.\r\nLast, but not least, allow me also to extend my\r\nsincere congratulations to the United Nations and to its\r\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, on the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize award. This is yet another proof of the lasting\r\nrelevance of the principles and values of our\r\nOrganization as enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter and of the outstanding leadership of its\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Reaz Rahman, State Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Rahman (Bangladesh): I wish warmly to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his unanimous\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly. We\r\nshare the conviction that he will infuse the work of the\r\nAssembly with dynamism and a new perspective.\r\nI also join in the warm tributes paid to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri. We congratulate\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and his staff on having\r\nbeen awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2001. He has\r\nbrought honour to us all. His re-election to a second\r\nterm is a just tribute to his dedication, commitment and\r\nsheer hard work.\r\nThe catastrophe of 11 September has scarred us\r\nall deeply. It has brought irrevocable change and\r\ninevitable hardship. Yet it has honed and hardened a\r\ncommon resolve, a steely determination to confront and\r\ncondemn all such irrational and mindless acts of\r\nviolence. Bangladesh stands committed to fight against\r\nterrorism, in all its forms and manifestation, by\r\nwhoever and wherever it is committed. We believe that\r\nterrorism hampers peace and security and creates\r\npolitical chaos and economic instability around the\r\nworld.\r\nWe have therefore pledged total support for the\r\nconcerted efforts of the international community to\r\nconfront this scourge as best, as quickly and as\r\ncomprehensively as we can. We have initiated the\r\nprocess of identifying any possible administrative or\r\nfinancial focus or network of suspected terrorists. We\r\nhave not given, and will not give, any form of\r\nsanctuary, training or support to any kind of terrorist\r\ngroup or cell. We are responding to the call of the\r\nSecretary-General and working towards becoming a\r\nparty to a number of United Nations anti-terrorist\r\ninstruments. We already subscribe to the 1987 South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\r\nConvention on Suppression of Terrorism and believe\r\nthat it has scope for further strengthening.\r\nAs a member of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference (OIC), we support, and will actively\r\nparticipate in, efforts to reach an agreement on the\r\nearly completion and adoption of a comprehensive\r\nconvention to combat terrorism. We hope that an\r\ninclusive approach will be taken that will unite us all in\r\nour common struggle against terrorism.\r\nWe are aware that terrorism has no consistent\r\nprofile and that it has many variables reflecting the\r\nincreasing complexity of human society. But this much\r\nis certain: we know what it is not. We must emphasize\r\nand underscore emphatically the fact that terrorism has\r\nno connection to any one religion or to any particular\r\n41\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nregion of the world. It is a global phenomenon and\r\nshould be addressed as such. We therefore welcome\r\nPresident Bushs statement to the General Assembly, at\r\nthe 44th meeting on 10 November, during which he\r\nquoted the sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the worlds\r\noldest Islamic institution of higher learning, as having\r\ndeclared that terrorism is a disease and that Islam\r\nprohibits killing innocent civilians.\r\nPrevious speakers have underlined the fact that\r\nthe spotlight on terrorism should not blind us to the\r\npursuit of other pressing objectives. Indeed, terrorism\r\nis but one aspect of the many negative forces that shape\r\nthe substance of what we call globalization, including\r\ndrugs, organized crime, the illicit transfer of small\r\narms, money-laundering, environmental degradation,\r\nand the new diseases that have invaded all societies.\r\nMany have intrinsic interlinkages, and none respect\r\nborders. They call for collective approaches and\r\nconcerted global action.\r\nOn the positive side, two crucial forces have\r\nimpelled globalization  mass consciousness of\r\nindividual rights and the impact of science and\r\ntechnology. The push for individual rights,\r\nhumanitarian concerns and a burgeoning new\r\nhumanitarian law are reflected in the worldwide sweep\r\nof democracy. Advances in science and technology\r\nhave closed the information and communications gap.\r\nTogether, these forces have changed the nature of our\r\nworld, challenged the context and meaning of\r\nsovereignty, and brought about a need for new and\r\ndynamic approaches.\r\nThe radical changes that came in the wake of the\r\nend of the cold war coincided in Bangladesh with the\r\noverthrow of military dictatorship in 1990 and the\r\nadvent of democracy. Since then, Bangladesh has held\r\nin succession three general elections that have been\r\nacclaimed by all impartial observers, both local and\r\nforeign, as being eminently free and fair. We have the\r\nunique distinction of being the only parliamentary\r\ndemocracy in which elections are constitutionally\r\ncarried out by an interim caretaker government within\r\na 90-day period.\r\nThe roots of democracy have taken hold and have\r\nspread far and wide. Today, despite all of Bangladeshs\r\nlimitations due to poverty, its people have\r\ndemonstrated unequivocally that they are a functioning,\r\nmoderate, modernizing Muslim country. The most\r\nrecent elections, held on 1 October 2001, had a voter\r\nturnout of 75 per cent of an electorate of over 70\r\nmillion people. What was extraordinary was the\r\nunprecedented number of women who freely exercised\r\ntheir right of franchise.\r\nIn an overwhelming demonstration of support, the\r\npeople have returned the four-party alliance led by\r\nPrime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to power, with\r\nmore than two-thirds majority seats in the Bangladesh\r\nParliament. This is an outstanding endorsement of, and\r\ntriumph for, democracy. It also imposes a huge burden\r\nof responsibility on the Government to measure up to\r\nthis massive mandate.\r\nThe Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Begum\r\nKhaleda Zia, has responded firmly. The new\r\nGovernment is committed to consolidating and\r\ndeveloping a sustainable structure of democracy with\r\nthe participation of the opposition. The primary focus\r\nis to restore law and order and to ensure social peace,\r\nharmony and justice, so as to improve our capacity to\r\nfight poverty, illiteracy and underdevelopment. Four\r\nfactors pace the economic agenda: reducing poverty,\r\nraising rural productivity, boosting trade and\r\nencouraging investment.\r\nIn pursuing these key factors, the Government\r\nwill refine its already established four-fold strategy of\r\n1991-1996: encouraging macroeconomic reform,\r\nstimulating the private sector, enhancing the quality\r\nand quantity of development expenditure and\r\nconcentrating on the quality, not quantity, of\r\ninvestment. There will be a cardinal push for\r\naggressive economic diplomacy in the wake of\r\nglobalization, which has called for closer interaction\r\nbetween domestic and foreign policy and which has\r\ntriggered intense competition for greater access to\r\nmarkets, the flow of resources and investments, the\r\ntransfer of technology and employment opportunities\r\nabroad.\r\nIn the pursuit of the pre-eminent objective of\r\nalleviating poverty, a key concern remains to place\r\npeople at the centre of all public policies.\r\nIn the field of foreign policy, a fundamental\r\ncharge remains that of reinforcing mutual, beneficial\r\nand cooperative relations with all countries and the\r\nconsolidation of our image abroad as a responsible,\r\nstable, moderate, democratic and contributing member\r\nof the world community.\r\n42\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nOur unwavering policy is to maintain close and\r\nfriendly relations with our neighbours on the basis of\r\nequality, mutual respect, non-interference in internal\r\naffairs and the settlement of outstanding bilateral issues\r\nthrough dialogue and negotiation. It is a matter of some\r\ngratification that, close on the heels of the formation of\r\nthe new Government, special envoys of the leaders of\r\nboth India and Pakistan visited Bangladesh as a\r\ngoodwill gesture to renew and reinvigorate ties.\r\nIn our region, a priority objective will be to\r\nrevitalize the momentum and credibility of the South\r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).\r\nIt is a matter of particular satisfaction that the stalled\r\ntwelfth SAARC Summit will now be taking place 4-6\r\nJanuary 2002 in Kathmandu, Nepal. It is of vital\r\nimportance that this first millennium summit of South\r\nAsian leaders forge a new vision for the future of the\r\nregion that will encompass promotion of not only its\r\nsocio-economic mandate, but also the reduction of\r\ntension, the normalization of relations and the creation\r\nof a broader-based climate of confidence-building.\r\nBangladesh believes that the most compelling\r\nsecurity challenge facing South Asia is promoting\r\nsustainable growth, reform and development.\r\nNuclearization in South Asia has, if anything, enhanced\r\nsecurity concerns in the region. Bangladesh adheres to\r\nthe belief that security goes beyond the weapons a\r\nnation possesses and extends to raising living standards\r\nand building stable and healthy democracies. The link\r\nbetween development and security is thus crucial in\r\nSouth Asia. This was the underlying rationale of\r\nSAARC. The guiding motivation  as enunciated by\r\nthe late President Ziaur Rahman  was to visibly\r\nimprove the quality of life of the common people in an\r\nenvironment of peace.\r\nIn the global context, a cardinal priority for\r\nBangladesh will be to play an active role through\r\nconcrete initiatives in all socio-economic forums, to\r\npromote the cause of developing countries as a whole\r\nand the least developed in particular and, especially, to\r\nkeep alive special treatment for the poorest of the poor.\r\nA fundamental objective for Bangladesh\r\nconsistent with our Constitution is to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations as the central organ for the\r\ncooperative management of the worlds problems.\r\nBangladesh will continue to actively contribute to the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, to bolster collective\r\nsecurity and peace-building. Our commitment to\r\npeacekeeping remains firm and has manifested itself in\r\nthe participation of Bangladeshi military and civilian\r\ncontingents in many areas of simultaneous conflicts.\r\nWe are immensely proud to be currently the largest\r\ncontributor among blue helmets, serving in ten United\r\nNations missions. In the field of peacekeeping, we\r\nbelieve that the recommendations of the Brahimi Panel\r\nprovide a good basis, and we feel that the Department\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) should be\r\nequipped adequately to handle such a requirement.\r\nBangladesh strongly believes that the issue of\r\nrepresentation of troop-contributing countries in the\r\nmilitary, civilian police and diplomatic components in\r\nthe DPKO and in other departments, as well as in the\r\nmission headquarters, should be seriously considered in\r\nthe context of the proposed expansion scheme.\r\nBangladeshs term in the Security Council is now\r\nabout to come to an end. We have sought to live up to\r\nour responsibility with pragmatism and moderation. We\r\nhave tried to make the work of the Council more\r\ntransparent, open and proactive and to develop an\r\neffective interface between the Council and the general\r\nmembership to reflect the aspirations of all on issues of\r\ncommon interest.\r\nToday, certain issues both political and economic\r\nhave assumed centre stage, and our attention is\r\ntelescoped upon them. Prime among them is the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan. Bangladesh is a part of the\r\ninternational coalition that seeks to establish a stable,\r\ndurable, social, political and economic structure in\r\nAfghanistan as soon as possible. It is our hope that the\r\nAfghan people will have a true opportunity to choose\r\ntheir own system of governance in line with human\r\nvalues and democratic practices in a post-Taliban\r\ndispensation. Such a Government should be broad-\r\nbased, multi-ethnic, demographically and equitably\r\nrepresentative, responsive to the needs of the Afghan\r\npeople and acceptable to the people of Afghanistan, the\r\nneighbourhood and the international community. We\r\nwelcome efforts to focus on positive and finite\r\nsolutions to the problems of Afghanistan, especially\r\nefforts being made with the assistance of the United\r\nNations for forming an interim transitional Government\r\nacceptable to the Afghan people. We also welcome two\r\nkey projects: first, a massive reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation plan and efforts to mobilize funding;\r\nsecond, a hard focus on ways and means to facilitate\r\nthe return of the refugees. Of immediate importance is\r\nthe vast humanitarian tragedy in Afghanistan, the need\r\n43\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nto contain and minimize the loss of human life and to\r\nreach out with immediate relief to refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nWhile new threats to peace, security and\r\neconomic stability are emerging, the old ones remain.\r\nOccupation, inter-State and intra-State conflicts,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East, Africa and the Balkans,\r\ncontinue to threaten regional and global peace and\r\nstability. We are particularly concerned at the steady\r\ndeterioration of the situation in Palestine, arising out of\r\nthe encroachment on Palestinian territories and the\r\ncollective punishment meted out to the Palestinians.\r\nBangladesh will continue to maintain its unflinching\r\nsupport of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople to an early establishment of a State of their own\r\nwith Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nPoverty today remains the pre-eminent moral\r\nand humanitarian challenge of our age and hence\r\nneeds to be tackled with due priority. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has reminded us of the commitments made by\r\nour leaders during the Millennium Summit last year to\r\neradicate this scourge.\r\nThe role of external financial support in the\r\ndevelopment process has assumed greater importance\r\nby virtue of the fact that better education, knowledge,\r\nskill and awareness must be effectively integrated into\r\nthe global economic and market mechanism. In this\r\ncontext, we look forward to the Monterrey\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in March 2002.\r\nOver the last few decades, access to global\r\nmarkets has been seriously limited for the products of\r\nthe developing countries in general and the least\r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) in particular. In this\r\ncontext, Bangladesh calls upon development partners\r\nto create more access for trade, including offering\r\nduty-free, quota-free access to products from the LDCs\r\non a secure, long-term and predictable basis with\r\nrealistic and flexible rules of origin to match the\r\nindustrial capacity of the LDCs. We are hopeful that\r\nthe current Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade\r\nOrganization in Doha will be able to effectively focus\r\non the obligations to implement the commitments made\r\nearlier during the Uruguay Round of negotiations. Debt\r\nrepayment is also an enormous burden on the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly on the LDCs. We\r\nurge the developed countries to expand the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) facility to include\r\nmore indebted developing countries, with particular\r\nfocus on the LDCs.\r\nBangladesh is committed to strengthening and to\r\nfollowing up on many ideas to bolster the United\r\nNations capacity to lead, especially that of the General\r\nAssembly. Bangladesh strongly supports the idea of\r\nforging better coordination between the major organs\r\nof the United Nations, namely the General Assembly,\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council,\r\nfor working out a long-term strategy for sustainable\r\npeace and development.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that it is not the\r\nlack of resources that prevents the promotion of a\r\ncollective and shared perspective on common\r\nchallenges. What we perhaps need is to muster the\r\ndetermination and courage to build up a collective and\r\ninclusive approach for undertaking pragmatic and\r\nforward-looking actions. The challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century remind us once again that we must seek\r\nharmony through diversity, peace through dialogue,\r\nand prosperity through mutual cooperation. The United\r\nNations offers the most appropriate and central\r\nmechanism to promote our best aspirations and\r\nobjectives. The journey to peace has always been\r\narduous; nonetheless, it is the longing for peace,\r\nprogress and justice that has inspired us to work for our\r\nbetter tomorrow.\r\nThe Acting President: I am pleased to inform\r\nmembers that we have heard the last speaker in the\r\ngeneral debate for this meeting. However, a couple of\r\nrepresentatives have requested to speak in exercise of\r\ntheir right of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the\r\nsecond intervention and should be made by the\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Mahmoudi (Islamic Republic of Iran): This\r\nmorning the delegate of the United Arab Emirates\r\nraised some unacceptable claims against the territorial\r\nintegrity of my country. Since we have clearly and\r\nrepeatedly put our position on this issue on record, I\r\nneed not go into detail.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is fully committed\r\nto its international obligations, especially those arising\r\nfrom the agreement of 1971. We finally believe that\r\n44\r\nA/56/PV.49\r\nmisunderstandings over the interpretation or\r\napplication of that agreement, if any, should be\r\naddressed with good will and through mutually agreed\r\nmechanisms in order to find a friendly solution.\r\nMr. Eldon (United Kingdom): I would like to\r\nrespond briefly to the remarks made today by the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Spain about Gibraltar.\r\nThe longstanding position of the British Government\r\non this matter is well known, and we continue to stand\r\nby the commitment to the people of Gibraltar set out in\r\nthe Preamble to the 1969 Constitution of Gibraltar,\r\nwhich enshrines the principle of consent of the people\r\nof Gibraltar to any change in sovereignty.\r\nThe British Government shares Spains view that\r\nissues relating to Gibraltar can be resolved only\r\nthrough dialogue such as that which we have recently\r\nresumed with Spain under the Brussels Process. We\r\nattach importance to continuing this dialogue with\r\nSpain as a means to build a better future for the people\r\nof Gibraltar, and, like Spain, we would welcome the\r\nattendance of the Chief Minister of Gibraltar at future\r\nministerial meetings.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I was not expecting that the appeal, the\r\npositive invitation to dialogue, addressed this morning\r\nto the Government of Iran would prompt the Iranian\r\ndelegation to request a right of reply. In response to the\r\nright of reply exercised by Iran, I wish to say that my\r\ncountry regrets the repeatedly taken position of\r\nrejecting our announced peaceful initiatives to resolve\r\nthe problem of the three occupied islands through\r\nbilateral negotiations or the International Court of\r\nJustice. Iran continues its civil and military occupation\r\nof these islands. What disappoints us is that Iran is\r\nprepared to deal only with marginal questions resulting\r\nfrom the occupation, but not with the substance of the\r\noccupation. The historic realities and the documents we\r\nhave refute Irans illegal claims to those islands.\r\nIt is our firmest hope that the Government of Iran\r\nwill reconsider its unacceptable policy and agree to our\r\npeaceful initiatives, reaffirmed today, in order to arrive\r\nat a just and comprehensive solution that restores these\r\nislands to their rightful owners, in response to the\r\nIranian proposal for dialogue among civilizations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n"
