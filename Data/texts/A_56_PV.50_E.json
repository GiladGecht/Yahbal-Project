(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Leo A. Falcam, President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia.\r\nMr. Leo A. Falcam, President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Leo A. Falcam, President\r\nof the Federated States of Micronesia, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Falcam: I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your election.\r\nMy Government hails the selection of a leader with\r\nsuch esteemed qualifications, and we are confident you\r\nwill lead the work of this body with the same high\r\ncompetence and spirit as did your distinguished\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. We also\r\nshare the pride felt by every Member of this body in\r\nthe award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the United\r\nNations Organization and to its highly admired\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan. We take great\r\nsatisfaction in his re-election to another term,\r\nespecially in this critical period.\r\nWords cannot describe the horror of my people at\r\nthe tragic event which unfolded here in New York, in\r\nWashington and other locations in September — and\r\nthe one yesterday. On behalf of my people, please\r\nallow me to reiterate our deepest and most sincere\r\ncondolences to the Government of the United States\r\nand to the victims and their families from all over the\r\nworld. Our resolve to combat international terrorism is\r\nunwavering. My country will stand ready to assist in\r\nany way it can in order to help bring those responsible\r\nfor these heinous acts to justice and to ease the\r\nsuffering of those affected by their actions.\r\nThe recently completed special debate on\r\nterrorism by this body makes it clear that we are all\r\nbrothers in this fight, with a shared determination to do\r\nwhat it takes to eradicate this blight on civilization.\r\nBut, despite the great sadness in all our hearts over the\r\nrecent and ongoing events, the regular work of this\r\nbody cannot be derailed. Part of winning this battle is\r\nto demonstrate the commitment and capacity of this\r\nbody to carry on with the great work of the Charter and\r\non all sides.\r\nThus, in addition to other actions that are being\r\ntaken to confront the current crisis, I call upon all\r\nMember States to ratify and bring into force as soon as\r\npossible the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which was\r\nadopted by a resolution of the General Assembly on 9\r\nDecember 1999. I signed this important Convention\r\nyesterday on behalf of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, and I anticipate its prompt ratification by\r\nour Congress.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nI take pleasure in saying that this year marks the\r\ntenth anniversary of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia’s membership in the United Nations. In\r\nthose 10 years, my nation and the world at large have\r\nundergone unprecedented change. With the assistance\r\nof the United Nations system, the Micronesian people\r\nhave worked tirelessly to forge our own identity at the\r\ninternational level.\r\nFifteen years ago, we entered into a relationship\r\nof Free Association with the United States of America.\r\nIt is a relationship largely unprecedented in\r\ninternational relations. This arrangement was subject to\r\ngreat scrutiny by the United Nations, which ultimately\r\napproved the end of our status as a United Nations\r\nTrust Territory. It is testimony to the efforts of this\r\nbody and the United Nations system that I stand before\r\nyou today as the representative of a nation — an equal\r\nin the community of nations.\r\nFor hundreds of years, our culture was isolated\r\nfrom the rest of the world. In the past 10 years, our\r\nmembership in the United Nations has opened up new\r\nhorizons, new partnerships and a new understanding of\r\npeoples. We also note our appreciation for the special\r\nknowledge we have gained through our interactions\r\nwith all of you here in this forum and elsewhere in the\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nIn the past 10 years, the world, like Micronesia\r\nitself, has changed at a pace heretofore unknown.\r\nAlthough we may celebrate some victories in conflict\r\nprevention, clearly, other grave challenges remain, and\r\nnew threats to international peace and security have\r\nemerged. We are encouraged at seeing the United\r\nNations assert its leadership in combating these\r\nproblems.\r\nThe past year has brought an ambitious slate of\r\nnew United Nations initiatives to enhance the well-\r\nbeing of peoples throughout the world. There are far\r\nmore noteworthy new initiatives than I have time to\r\nmention here. But please allow me to highlight a few of\r\nthem.\r\nWhile the effects of some grave threats to the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia will gradually manifest\r\nthemselves over the coming decades, my nation is\r\ncurrently grappling with an ongoing and immediate\r\nconcern: poverty. I am not speaking of the poverty of\r\nhunger and unchecked disease, but of the all-too-\r\ncommon developing world condition that has resulted\r\nfrom the persistent failure of all nations to achieve\r\nequal and equitable sharing of the world’s bounties.\r\nUnfortunately, we are not alone, but this provides little\r\nsolace. We applaud the United Nations as it continues\r\nits heroic work to reduce poverty and to bring a better\r\nstandard of living to all peoples of the world. We will\r\ncontinue to work with our colleagues within the Group\r\nof 77 and China to further poverty reduction measures\r\nand to improve the standard of living of all humankind.\r\nThe historic isolation of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia has sheltered us from the scourge of many\r\ncommunicable diseases, such as AIDS. Our integration\r\nwith the world community has brought about change\r\nhere as well. In this past year my country experienced\r\nits first domestic case of HIV infection. This is minor\r\nin comparison to the experience of those countries that\r\nhave been devastated by the disease, but it is cause for\r\nconcern, nonetheless, in a country of little more than\r\n100,000 people. We wholeheartedly support United\r\nNations initiatives in this regard, such as the recently\r\nconcluded General Assembly special session on\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nTraditional conflicts remain and, most troubling,\r\nmany old animosities have spilled over into open\r\nhostilities. This serves to underscore the importance of\r\nUnited Nations initiatives, such as this year’s World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, which recently\r\nconcluded in Durban, South Africa.\r\nAfter many years of overall peace and\r\ntranquillity, our region of the Pacific islands has\r\nrecently seen a few long-standing conflicts erupt into\r\nviolence of disturbing proportions. We applaud the\r\nefforts of the United Nations aimed at arriving at\r\npeaceful settlements, and the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia lends its full support to ongoing measures\r\ndesigned to keep the peace.\r\nIn the Pacific, one of the most effective means to\r\nthat end has always been the Pacific Islands Forum. In\r\nthe 30 years of its existence, the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nhas played a pivotal role in maintaining the peace and\r\nsecurity of our region. It has also contributed to notable\r\nprogress on a broad slate of economic and social\r\nissues. I was pleased to participate in the recent\r\nmeeting of the Forum and can express my country’s\r\nfull support for this year’s communiqué, which has\r\nbeen issued as a document of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nAs a nation with one of the youngest populations\r\nin the world, the issues of children and youth are of\r\nutmost concern to us. We therefore commend the\r\ndecision to hold the special session of the General\r\nAssembly on children. We understand fully the need to\r\nreschedule it and are gratified that the Assembly has\r\ndecided to hold this session next May in order to give\r\nthe issues of children and youth the prominence they\r\ndeserve. On a related note, I am pleased to report that\r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia has begun the\r\nprocess of evaluation with a view to signing and\r\nratifying the two Optional Protocols to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child.\r\nGiven the monumental pace of change, it is not\r\nsurprising that in some respects the United Nations\r\nitself has been unable to keep pace with developments.\r\nWe are appreciative of ongoing reform efforts, but we\r\nwould encourage redoubled efforts on remaining\r\nmatters that cry out for attention, such as the\r\nreconstitution of the Security Council.\r\nWhile my nation grapples with the entire\r\nspectrum of transnational problems, such as drug\r\ntrafficking and other aspects of international criminal\r\nactivity, there is one threat that has our special\r\nattention. I am speaking, of course, about the\r\naccelerated rise in sea level caused by global climate\r\nchange. We now know that the production of\r\ngreenhouse gases by human activity plays a prominent\r\nrole. It is this global issue that threatens my country’s\r\nfuture as no other.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia contributes\r\nonly in an infinitesimal way to the problem of human-\r\ninduced climate change; yet we are among the “front-\r\nline” States that must deal with its impacts. We are\r\ncomprised of a geologically diverse range of islands,\r\nfrom low-level coral atolls to mountainous volcanic\r\noutcrops. All share one common denominator — since\r\nthe dawn of time, our people’s livelihood has been tied\r\nto the sea. Even on our high islands, such as Pohnpei\r\nand Kosrae, the vast majority of the population on all\r\nislands lives in the coastal plain. On most islands, the\r\npossibility of moving to higher ground does not exist.\r\nThe distinguished scientists of the\r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\r\nhave confirmed that the climate is changing and that\r\nhuman activities are playing a significant part in the\r\nwarming of our planet. Credible scientific evidence\r\nsuggests that the magnitude of the impact of that\r\nwarming may be greater than even the most extreme\r\nestimates just 10 years ago. Indeed, it may already be\r\ntoo late to save my country and many others like it\r\nworldwide.\r\nAlready, our region has seen the beginnings of the\r\nmovement of its peoples as a result of the rise in sea\r\nlevel caused by global warming. This year, Tuvalu, one\r\nof our similarly situated neighbours in the region,\r\nannounced that it had begun examining relocation\r\noptions. Unfortunately, its initial results were not\r\nencouraging, as there is no uniform willingness among\r\nmore fortunate countries to provide a haven for these\r\nfirst “climate change refugees”. Undoubtedly, it will be\r\nthe outlying atolls of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, home to about half of our population, that\r\nare among the next to join the people of Tuvalu if\r\ncurrent trends continue.\r\nThese developments point with new urgency to\r\nthe need for constructive discussion of adaptation\r\nstrategies and funding for small island developing\r\nStates. We are encouraged by the new attention paid to\r\nthese issues at the recent conference in Bonn, and we\r\nwelcome the constructive outcomes of the conference\r\njust completed in Marrakesh with regard to such\r\nimportant issues as the enforcement of compliance.\r\nWe and all other parties to the Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change, signed nine years ago,\r\nwere motivated by the “precautionary principle”,\r\nwhereby the lack of airtight scientific certainty could\r\nnot be the basis for inaction. Today, virtually no\r\nuncertainty remains as to the reality of the main\r\nproblem. Yet we are dismayed to see that in the media\r\nand elsewhere a handful of “greenhouse gas sceptics”\r\nare often still given a podium equal to that given to the\r\ndistinguished scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel\r\non Climate Change.\r\nIn the past 10 years we have seen some progress\r\nin the form of the Framework Convention and the\r\nKyoto Protocol, thanks to the tireless efforts of many\r\ndelegations and good will on the part of Governments.\r\nHowever, a change in the position of several key\r\nsignatories to the Protocol, which are also among the\r\nworld’s largest generators of greenhouse gases,\r\nundermines the success of the recent Bonn and\r\nMarrakesh talks, and has created a great deal of\r\nconcern on the part of all low-lying island States. We\r\nwarmly applaud those countries that have stood by\r\ntheir commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nWe call upon those that have not to find the political\r\nwill to take the actions that are, after all, in their own\r\nlong-term best interests.\r\nI do not mean to ignore the initial economic\r\nhardships these changes might entail; we understand\r\nthem all too well. In the last five years, the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia has taken unprecedented measures\r\nto reduce the size of its public sector, far and away the\r\nlargest employer in my country. These moves were\r\nvastly unpopular politically. Still, they were necessary\r\nand have put us on the right footing for a sustainable\r\neconomic future. Similarly, longer-term economic\r\nbenefits and competitive advantage can be gained by\r\nthose nations that adopt a progressive climate change\r\nstrategy.\r\nWe Micronesians are a proud people. Throughout\r\nthe centuries, we have endured seemingly\r\ninsurmountable difficulties. The threat from climate\r\nchange is only the latest of these. Like some others we\r\nhave faced, it is not of our own making, and it is not\r\nsomething that we can overcome by ourselves. The\r\nKyoto Protocol, as it has been hammered out in\r\nMarrakesh, provides a necessary mechanism with\r\nwhich most nations can begin to attack global\r\nwarming. I congratulate the negotiators on their\r\nsignificant, even historic, accomplishment. The\r\nemission cuts agreed to, however, amount to only a\r\nsmall first step.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reiterate the sincere\r\ncondolences of the people of the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia to those in all regions of the world who are\r\nsuffering today from violence, poverty, terrorism and\r\nthe violation of human rights. We pray for a peaceful\r\nend to the current conflicts raging throughout many\r\nregions.\r\nWe are reassured that the spirit and principles of\r\nthe United Nations will guide leaders as they strive to\r\nprevent future outbreaks of violence while seeking to\r\nrelieve current suffering. My delegation is proud of its\r\ncontributions during our first 10 years of membership\r\nand pledges to do its utmost to continue to advance the\r\ngoals of the United Nations for the betterment of all\r\npeople throughout the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nFederated States of Micronesia for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nMr. Leo A. Falcam, President of the Federated\r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo, President\r\nof the Republic of Nicaragua\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Nicaragua, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Lacayo (spoke in Spanish): Before I\r\nproceed, allow me, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of Nicaragua, to express our sorrow to the\r\npeople and the Government of the Dominican Republic\r\nfor yesterday’s event. Allow me also, Mr. President, to\r\njoin those who have come before me in congratulating\r\nyou on your well-deserved election as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, and to\r\nexpress my confidence that under your competent\r\ndirection this session will conclude its work\r\nsuccessfully. I also wish to express our most profound\r\nappreciation for the praiseworthy work achieved by the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland.\r\nLikewise, I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, not only for having been re-\r\nelected to a second mandate with the consensus of the\r\nentire international community, but also for the recent,\r\nwell-deserved, high distinction of being awarded,\r\ntogether with the United Nations, the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize.\r\nThe people and the Government of Nicaragua\r\nreceived with great concern the news of the criminal\r\nterrorist attacks against the people and the Government\r\nof the United States on 11 September. Since then, we\r\nhave offered our solidarity and cooperation to the\r\npeople and the Government of the United States for the\r\ncapture and punishment of all those involved in those\r\nabhorrent acts. The magnitude of those terrorist acts\r\nbrings new and diverse challenges in the political,\r\neconomic and security areas. The enemies of peace and\r\ndemocracy have attempted to create a widespread\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nclimate of uncertainty and fear. For this reason, our\r\nfirst challenge is not to allow ourselves to be\r\nintimidated or paralysed by their criminal threats and\r\nactions.\r\nAt the Central American level, on 19 September\r\nin Honduras, the Presidents of the isthmus adopted a\r\nDeclaration entitled “Central America united against\r\nterrorism”, in which we strongly condemned any ties\r\nbetween groups or sectors in the Central American\r\nregion and international terrorism. As of that date, we\r\nbegan to undertake concrete initiatives aimed at\r\nimproving information systems between neighbouring\r\ncountries; increasing coordination between air and\r\nnaval forces to deal with illicit traffic; ensuring better\r\nborder monitoring; enabling the exchange of\r\ninformation between specialized public security\r\nagencies; increasing control over travel documents; and\r\nstrengthening security for airports and civil aviation.\r\nNicaragua is a party to those measures and\r\nprovisions that promote and safeguard international\r\nand regional peace and security through the prevention\r\nand peaceful resolution of disputes between States and\r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear and conventional\r\nweapons of mass destruction, which contravene the\r\nprinciples of international humanitarian law.\r\nOur firm commitment to world peace and security\r\nled my country to host the Third Meeting of the States\r\nParties to the Ottawa Convention, despite the fact that\r\nthat meeting took place soon after the events of 11\r\nSeptember. The Managua Conference allowed the\r\nStates parties to renew their commitment and to note\r\nwith satisfaction the important progress that has been\r\nmade in the crusade to eliminate anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. The ratification of the Convention by more\r\nthan 120 States; the strengthening of the mechanisms\r\nfor its implementation; the progress in mine removal;\r\nthe destruction of mines stockpiled in different parts of\r\nthe world; and the virtual embargo on the international\r\ntrade in these weapons are concrete steps in our effort\r\nto end the suffering brought about by antipersonnel\r\nmines.\r\nI would like to earnestly appeal to the States that\r\nhave not yet done so to ratify the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as well as the Convention for\r\nthe Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines. Nicaragua\r\nalso welcomes with satisfaction the Programme of\r\nAction to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade\r\nin small arms and light weapons in all its aspects,\r\nadopted on 21 July.\r\nJust one year ago, we convened the Millennium\r\nSummit, at which we made commitments designed to\r\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century and\r\nreaffirmed our faith in the United Nations as the central\r\ninstrument for promoting peace, security, prosperity\r\nand justice.\r\nIn order to respond effectively to the challenges\r\nthat the new millennium imposes on us — challenges\r\nthat cannot be ignored — it is crucial that we take\r\nresolute steps to reform the United Nations, ensuring\r\nthat its policies and structures are commensurate with\r\nthe realities and aspirations of contemporary\r\ninternational society. Nicaragua shares the interest of\r\nall Member States in strengthening our Organization so\r\nas to optimize its work in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, conflict prevention,\r\nthe promotion of sustainable development and the\r\nbattle against poverty.\r\nIn this context, it is crucial to move forward with\r\nreform of the Security Council so that that body can\r\nrespond fully and effectively to current needs and to\r\nfuture challenges to our peoples.\r\nFurthermore, the profound changes experienced\r\nby societies throughout the world since 1945 require\r\nthe United Nations urgently to reaffirm its universal\r\nvocation as a fundamental prerequisite for confronting\r\nnew challenges through the full and effective\r\nparticipation of all peoples, without distinction and\r\nexcluding no one.\r\nHowever, this universal vocation cannot be fully\r\nrealized as long as a democratic State and signatory of\r\nthe San Francisco Charter is unable to participate as a\r\nfull-fledged Member within the United Nations system.\r\nAs is well known, the Republic of China is a\r\ndemocratic country, and its freely and transparently\r\nelected Government is the only one that can\r\nlegitimately represent the interests and desires of the\r\npeople of Taiwan at the United Nations. We should not\r\ncontinue to deny the 23 million people who live in the\r\nRepublic of China the right to be represented in the\r\nUnited Nations and to share with us the efforts to\r\npromote peace and development for future generations.\r\nLet us recall that the Republic of China has\r\nplayed a positive role in the promotion of world trade,\r\nthe eradication of poverty and the advancement of\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nhuman rights. These laudable efforts at the national and\r\ninternational levels must be recognized by the United\r\nNations; the Republic of China should be given the\r\nright to integrate itself into the international order of\r\nthe United Nations, having fulfilled the basic\r\nconditions in accordance with international law.\r\nSince the beginning of my mandate in 1997, we\r\nNicaraguans have taken significant steps in the\r\nimportant task of consolidating democracy and guiding\r\nour country along the path of development. The\r\nNicaraguan people have made great sacrifices in laying\r\nthe foundations of sustainable human development by\r\nstrengthening the rule of law; stabilizing the economy\r\nthrough the implementation of responsible financial\r\nand fiscal policies; providing for the effective\r\nparticipation of civil society in national decision-\r\nmaking; and formulating a long-term strategy in the\r\nbattle against poverty and for reducing economic,\r\nsocial and environmental vulnerability. That process,\r\nhowever, has not been easy, because of the heavy\r\nburden of our external national debt, international\r\nfinancial crises, the fall in the price of our main export\r\nproducts and natural disasters.\r\nThe elections held in my country on 4 November\r\nwill go down in national history as an example of\r\ntransparency, public spirit and profound democratic\r\nconviction. The orderly and transparent way in which\r\nthe process unfolded, broad citizen participation, with\r\nfewer than 10 per cent of the population failing to take\r\npart, and the attitude of the people of Nicaragua reflect\r\nof the degree to which my country has progressed in\r\nstrengthening its democratic institutions.\r\nWe strongly support the convening of the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development to take place in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa, in September 2002, the\r\ntask of which will be to determine the current status of\r\nthe implementation of the commitments undertaken at\r\nthe Earth Summit. As a reflection of that will, we note\r\nour ratification of the Conventions on Climate Change\r\nand Biological Diversity, the efforts carried out by the\r\nNational Council for Sustainable Development and\r\nNicaragua’s participation in major projects for the\r\npreservation of the rich ecosystems of the region, such\r\nas the Meso-American Biological Corridor and the\r\nAtlantic Biological Corridor.\r\nThe new problems and challenges that humanity\r\nfaces greatly exceed our individual capabilities as\r\nStates. For that reason, it is imperative that we renew\r\nour commitment to the goals and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations, which will allow us to continue to\r\nadvance in the building of a world that is more just,\r\npeaceful and secure for future generations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Nicaragua for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Arnoldo Alemán Lacayo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Nambar Enkhbayar, Prime Minister\r\nof Mongolia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Nambar Enkhbayar, Prime Minister of\r\nMongolia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Nambar Enkhbayar,\r\nPrime Minister of Mongolia, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Enkhbayar (Mongolia): At the outset, I wish\r\nto pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, upon his unanimous re-election. The Nobel\r\nPeace Prize conferred upon the United Nations and its\r\nSecretary-General testifies to the broad recognition of\r\nthe increasing role played by the world Organization in\r\npromoting peace, security and development and vests\r\nin it, at the same time, greater responsibility and trust\r\nin meeting both the existing and evolving global\r\nchallenges.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking\r\nplace at a time when the international community is\r\ndrawn together more closely in the face of the\r\nunprecedented task of developing an effective response\r\nto the challenge of terrorism. The people and\r\nGovernment of Mongolia have resolutely condemned\r\nthe barbaric attacks of 11 September as a deliberate act\r\nof terrorism against freedom and democracy — an\r\nattack against all humanity and expressed its full\r\nsupport for the collective efforts of the anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition. From this high rostrum, I wish to reaffirm\r\nMongolia’s strong commitment to our common\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nstruggle against the scourge of terrorism. I wish, on\r\nbehalf of the Government of Mongolia, to reiterate our\r\nprofound sympathy to the people and Government of\r\nthe United States of America and to all the families that\r\nhave been affected by this tragic event. I also express\r\nmy condolences to New Yorkers and to the\r\nGovernments of the United States of America and the\r\nDominican Republic over the tragic accident that took\r\nplace yesterday here in New York.\r\nThe response of the international community to\r\nthe terrorist attacks has clearly demonstrated its firm\r\nresolve to collectively fight this global scourge. In this\r\nrespect, Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) of 28\r\nSeptember is a timely measure, unprecedented both in\r\nits scope and nature. It has laid the groundwork for\r\npractical measures to be taken by all Member States in\r\nthe fight against terrorism and established an effective\r\nmechanism to monitor its implementation. My\r\nGovernment is taking every necessary measure to\r\nimplement the provisions of the resolution and the\r\nrelevant report to that effect was submitted to the\r\ncounter-terrorism Committee of the Security Council\r\non 10 November.\r\nI wish also to inform the Assembly that Mongolia\r\nsigned yesterday the 1999 International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. With its\r\nratification in the near future, Mongolia will be party to\r\nall the United Nations anti-terrorism conventions\r\napplicable to it. We also believe that, in light of recent\r\nevents, the existing international legal framework on\r\nterrorism ought to be further strengthened through the\r\nspeedy conclusion of a comprehensive convention\r\nagainst international terrorism and a convention against\r\nnuclear terrorism, preferably at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. In the same vein, the pace of setting\r\nup the International Criminal Court must be\r\naccelerated.\r\nIn order to put the anti-terrorist strategy in the\r\nright perspective, it would seem important to us to see\r\nthe problem in a wider setting, that is, to address issues\r\nthat provide a fertile soil for terrorism, such as\r\ntransnational organized crime, illicit drugs, money\r\nlaundering, illegal arms trafficking and others. The\r\nUnited Nations, in our view, is uniquely positioned to\r\nmeet such a challenge and to develop a comprehensive\r\nstrategy to uproot international terrorism through\r\nglobal and concerted action.\r\nThe events of 11 September have drastically\r\nchanged the world as we see it. It has revealed the\r\nheightened vulnerability of the human family. It has\r\nalso revealed, in no uncertain terms, the need for\r\nchange in our approach to the way we perceive our\r\nown security. In this regard, the concept of human\r\nsecurity, which places the safety, security and well-\r\nbeing of a human being at the heart of the matter,\r\ndeserves our utmost attention. We see the prime merit\r\nof the human security concept to be that it addresses in\r\na comprehensive manner the three-tiered freedom\r\noutlined in the Millennium Declaration: freedom from\r\nwant, freedom from fear and freedom to live in a\r\nhealthier and cleaner environment.\r\nIn the emerging era of globalization, it is\r\nbecoming increasingly evident that no country can\r\nensure its security on its own. This indivisibility of\r\nglobal human security requires a genuine display of\r\nsolidarity and collective responsibility on the part of\r\nevery country of the international community so that it\r\ncan effectively address the formidable challenges at the\r\nturn of the new millennium.\r\nAfter several decades of development efforts, the\r\nnumber of the world’s poor remains at an\r\nembarrassingly high level. Exclusion, marginalization\r\nand inequality among and within countries are being\r\nfurther exacerbated by both existing and evolving\r\ntransboundary threats.\r\nLooking back, one could describe the decade of\r\nthe 1990s as a decade of commitments for\r\ndevelopment, with a series of international conferences\r\nand summits resulting in important declarations and\r\nplans of action. Yet today, the world finds itself in\r\nmany respects in no better shape. The legitimate\r\nquestion arises: Why? Does the international\r\ncommunity, increasingly seen as a single human family\r\nliving in a shared global village, have the capacity to\r\nredress this situation? Technically, the right answer\r\nseems to be yes. There are resources — financial,\r\nhuman and technological — to ensure a better life. On\r\nthe other hand, one has to admit also that the\r\nunderlying reasons could be manifold, as the changes\r\nundergone and challenges faced by the world over the\r\nlast decade are indeed complex both in nature and in\r\nscope.\r\nYet, we cannot but agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\n“The widening gap between goals and\r\nachievements implies that the international\r\ncommunity has failed to deliver on crucial\r\ncommitments it made during the 1990s”.\r\n(A/56/326, para. 81)\r\nThe real, hard question is then: Do we have the\r\nsufficient political will and sense of solidarity to forge\r\nthe genuine partnership needed to erase the staggering\r\ndiscrepancy between commitments and action? In the\r\nfinal analysis, the answer to this question has to be\r\naffirmative and has to be supported by practical,\r\nmeaningful action. We cannot afford to fail to honour\r\nfor yet another decade our commitments if we are\r\nserious about ensuring human security. We cannot\r\nafford to fail to implement the far-reaching yet\r\nachievable targets set by the Millennium Summit last\r\nyear. Our failure could be used as a justification for\r\ndeadly acts by those who pose a threat to humanity. Let\r\nus therefore make the first decade of this new century\r\none of implementation and cooperation for a safer,\r\nhealthier and better world. Additional efforts are\r\nurgently required, and affluent countries could exhibit\r\ntheir solidarity and shared responsibility by further\r\nopening their markets, providing broader and faster\r\ndebt relief and giving more and better-focused\r\ndevelopment assistance and incentives for foreign\r\ndirect investment flows to their less fortunate partners.\r\nWe must mobilize the political will necessary to\r\nmake the upcoming conferences on financing for\r\ndevelopment, sustainable development and food\r\nsecurity a success. The lead-up to these important\r\nevents and the conferences themselves are to take into\r\nconsideration the special needs of small, vulnerable\r\nand structurally disadvantaged economies so as to\r\nenable them to integrate into the multilateral trading\r\nsystem and take advantage of the opportunities offered\r\nby the advance of globalization. We also believe that\r\nthe international ministerial meeting on transit\r\ntransport cooperation, to be held in 2003, is of crucial\r\nimportance in enhancing international cooperation to\r\nease the inherent development handicaps of the\r\nlandlocked developing countries, as recognized in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that a commitment\r\nto human security demands enhanced international\r\ncooperation in conflict prevention and strengthened\r\ncapacities to assist countries in restoring, building and\r\nkeeping the peace. In this respect, Mongolia fully\r\nsupports the Secretary-General in his efforts to move\r\nthe United Nations from a culture of reaction to a\r\nculture of prevention. We believe that mutual\r\nunderstanding and dialogue among different peoples\r\nand civilizations are acutely needed to break the pattern\r\nof mistrust, suspicion and recrimination that either lead\r\nto a conflict or serve as a pretext for it. We know that\r\nmutual understanding and dialogue are possible when\r\nthere is cooperation between nations.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is of\r\nspecial significance to my country and its people, as we\r\ncelebrate the fortieth anniversary of Mongolia’s\r\nadmission to the United Nations. On 27 October 1961\r\nMongolia became a full-fledged member of the world\r\nOrganization, an event of historic importance to my\r\npeople. Over the years our cooperation with the\r\norganizations of the United Nations family has been\r\nexpanding both in scope and in substance. Today\r\nMongolia is party to some 140 international treaties\r\nand conventions, and is a member of 33 inter-\r\ngovernmental and 20 regional and other organizations.\r\nThe United Nations assistance and cooperation has\r\nbeen instrumental in developing human resources,\r\ncapacity-building, education, health and information\r\ntechnology, reducing poverty, protecting the\r\nenvironment and developing an adequate response to\r\nnatural disasters.\r\nWithin the framework of the fortieth anniversary,\r\nwe have been undertaking a host of activities to take\r\nstock of our past cooperation with the organizations of\r\nthe United Nations system and identify priority areas\r\nfor future cooperation. This culminated in the joint\r\nconference organized by the Government of Mongolia\r\nand the United Nations on 3 September, in Ulaanbaatar,\r\nunder the theme “Forty Years of Mongolia-United\r\nNations Cooperation: Implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration”. The main thrust of the\r\ndiscussions and conclusions of that conference has\r\nbeen incorporated into the memorandum of the\r\nGovernment of Mongolia on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, which has been circulated as\r\nan official document of this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nOver the last four decades of our cooperation,\r\nMongolia has been endeavouring to contribute, where\r\nit could, to the common efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to promote peace, cooperation and\r\ndevelopment. My delegation is proud to recall that on\r\nthe initiative of Mongolia the General Assembly\r\nadopted the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nPeace, the principles and guidelines for international\r\nnegotiations, resolutions to observe annually a\r\nDisarmament Week and relevant resolutions on the\r\nimportance of human resources, cooperatives, rural\r\nwomen and the special needs of the landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries. Furthermore, as a strong\r\nadvocate of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts\r\nof the world, in 1992 Mongolia declared its own\r\nterritory a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and has been\r\nworking to further institutionalize this.\r\nRecognizing the crucial role of education in\r\nensuring sustainable human development and human\r\nsecurity, my delegation is pleased to note that this\r\nsession of the General Assembly is about to proclaim,\r\non Mongolia’s initiative, the 10-year period beginning\r\n1 January 2003 the United Nations decade for literacy.\r\nMongolia supports peacekeeping operations as\r\none of the important means of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. Since the mid-1990s,\r\nMongolia has taken deliberate steps and made\r\nmeasurable progress in developing its peacekeeping\r\ncapability. Showing its willingness to contribute to the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions through direct\r\nparticipation, in 1999 Mongolia signed a memorandum\r\nof understanding with the United Nations on standby\r\narrangements regarding the provision of staff officers,\r\nmilitary observers and medical officers. Mongolia\r\nstands ready to actively cooperate with the United\r\nNations and to make a practical contribution to its\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nAs a member of the Conference on Disarmament,\r\nMongolia cannot but fully agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in paragraph 77 of his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/56/1), that the “level of\r\ninternational cooperation in disarmament remains\r\ndisappointingly low.” In order to bring the Conference\r\non Disarmament out of its ongoing stalemate it may\r\nseem advisable to give political impetus to the\r\ndisarmament agenda by convening a Security Council\r\nmeeting at the highest level or holding one of the future\r\nsessions of the Conference on Disarmament at the level\r\nof Foreign Ministers.\r\nIn recent years Mongolia has been an active\r\nparticipant in international activities aimed at\r\nstrengthening institutions and processes of democratic\r\ngovernance, protecting human rights and promoting\r\ndemocratic consolidation. The 1992 Constitution of\r\nMongolia guarantees the Mongolian people\r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights. Mongolia is\r\nparty to all major international human rights\r\ninstruments. Earlier this year Mongolia set up an\r\nindependent National Human Rights Commission.\r\nYesterday Mongolia signed the two Optional Protocols\r\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Willing\r\nto share its fresh experience of peaceful and\r\nsimultaneous transition to democracy and a market-\r\noriented economy over the last decade and to learn\r\nmore from the valuable experiences of other countries,\r\nMongolia has offered to host the Fifth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies in 2003\r\nin Ulaanbaatar.\r\nThe task of ensuring human security and\r\npromoting human-centred development is high on the\r\nagenda of my Government, as envisaged in its\r\nprogramme of action. Recognizing the importance of\r\nthe quality of governance in achieving development\r\ngoals, my Government approved a national programme\r\non good governance for human security to facilitate the\r\npolicy focus, coherence and sustainability of its\r\nprogramme of action. Mongolia has thus become the\r\nfirst country aspiring to ensure human security through\r\nbuilding good governance. As we move along this\r\ntrailblazing path, we are aware of the need for the\r\nknowledge, expertise, experience and assistance of the\r\norganizations of the United Nations system and our\r\nfellow members of the international community.\r\nThe Government is resolved to ensure sustained\r\neconomic growth through reinvigorating and\r\nencouraging the development of domestic industry,\r\nrehabilitating the banking sector, upgrading the living\r\nstandards of the people, reducing poverty and\r\nunemployment, and ensuring equitable social and\r\neducational opportunities. We will intensify structural\r\nreforms and encourage an export-oriented, private-\r\nsector-led economy. Mining, processing of raw\r\nmaterials of animal origin, tourism and other export-\r\noriented sectors are the top priority areas of\r\ndevelopment. Privatization of State assets, including\r\nthe most valuable State enterprises, will continue. The\r\ncreation of a favourable environment for the attraction\r\nof foreign investment is also a priority objective.\r\nIn its endeavours to carry out simultaneous\r\neconomic and political reforms Mongolia faces many\r\nchallenges. On behalf of the Government of Mongolia,\r\nI wish to express our sincere gratitude and high\r\nappreciation to our bilateral and multilateral partners\r\nfor their generous support and cooperation pledged at\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nthe eighth meeting of the Mongolia Assistance Group,\r\nheld last May in Paris, demonstrating thus their support\r\nof my Government’s policy and action.\r\nMongolia will continue its active participation in\r\nmultilateral processes and international organizations\r\nsuch as the United Nations and will spare no effort to\r\nensure that the world Organization remains a focal\r\npoint for coordination of the effort of the community of\r\nnations toward peace and development in the years to\r\ncome.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of\r\nMongolia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Enkhbayar, Prime Minister of Mongolia, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency the Honourable Jakaya Kikwete, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Kikwete (United Republic of Tanzania): I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. Your\r\nelection is a clear manifestation of the entire\r\nmembership’s confidence in and high regard for your\r\nable leadership and diplomatic skills. We wish you\r\nsuccess in the tasks ahead. I want to assure you of my\r\ndelegation’s full cooperation and support.\r\nOur salutations are also extended to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for a job\r\nwell done.\r\nAllow me also to sincerely congratulate\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on the able and\r\ndistinguished manner in which he has continued to\r\nadminister and guide the affairs of our Organization.\r\nHis re-election to a second term attests to the\r\nconfidence and trust that we have in him. The award of\r\nthis year’s Nobel Peace Prize to him and the United\r\nNations is recognition of his personal attributes and\r\ncontributions to strengthening the world body. It is also\r\nrecognition of the glorious performance and\r\nachievements of the United Nations in the search of\r\nglobal peace, solidarity and prosperity.\r\nAs we applaud and pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations for their remarkable\r\nachievements, the horrific terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember against the United States are a clear\r\nreminder to us all that the fight for lasting world peace\r\nis far from being won. Strangely enough, the fight can\r\ntake new dangerous dimensions when aeroplanes,\r\nwhich are a magnificent human invention for the fast\r\nmovement of people, goods and services between\r\ndistant places, can themselves become weapons in\r\nterror attacks.\r\nComing from a country that fell victim to a\r\nterrorist attack with the bombing of the United States\r\nEmbassy in Dar es Salaam in 1998, I can clearly\r\nunderstand the pain, anger and quest for revenge on the\r\npart of President George Bush, his Administration and\r\nthe people of the United States of America. On that\r\nfateful day, when 11 of our fellow citizen’s perished\r\nand over 70 people were wounded, the Government\r\nand people of my country felt exactly the same. We\r\ntherefore perceive and share the pain and grief of the\r\npeople of the United States and support their right and\r\nthat of their Government to seek redresses and fight the\r\nperpetrators of this heinous crime.\r\nTerrorism is a horrendous crime in its brutality\r\nand victimization. It is wanton, cruel and\r\nindiscriminate. The world must work together to fight\r\nand defeat it. Allow me to reiterate Tanzania’s pledges,\r\nresolve and readiness to continue to participate fully in\r\nthe efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nThe events of 11 September remind us once more\r\nof the need to expedite the process establishing the\r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nAllow me also to convey sincere sympathy to the\r\nfamilies of the deceased in yesterday’s tragic plane\r\ncrash. Our thoughts and prayers are with them in this\r\ntime of grief.\r\nThis is the first session of the General Assembly\r\nafter the Millennium Summit held here last year. At\r\nthat Summit, the world leaders defined the agenda and\r\nstrategies of our Organization in the new century.\r\nThere was common understanding in the new century, a\r\nresolve to continue to work together to tackle the\r\nnumerous problems bequeathed by the last century. It is\r\nthe view of my delegation that this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the subsequent ones should\r\ntranslate that commitment into concrete actions.\r\nPermit me at this juncture to share with the\r\nAssembly some thoughts about what could be the\r\nimportant priorities of the United Nations. Tanzania\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nwould like to see a United Nations that continues to be\r\nthe guarantor of world peace and security, a United\r\nNations that has the development agenda at the centre\r\nof its main objectives and activities and a United\r\nNations that continues to fight for justice and equality\r\namong peoples and nations the world over.\r\nStrengthening and revitalizing the United Nations\r\nis an imperative we all agreed to undertake almost a\r\ndecade ago. We have done a remarkable job as regards\r\nthe restructuring of the Secretariat and the United\r\nNations agencies. It is regrettable that reform and\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council remain elusive. A\r\nprocess started seven years ago has yet to bear the\r\ndesired result. The disturbing thing is the fact that in\r\nsome quarters it no longer appears to be a priority\r\nsubject.\r\nTanzania believes that expansion of Security\r\nCouncil membership in both categories is as relevant\r\nand desirable today as it was seven years ago. We\r\nwould like to reaffirm our support for the principle of\r\nequitable representation of Member States on the basis\r\nof their geographical regions. In particular, we want to\r\nreiterate support for Africa’s request for two seats in\r\nthe permanent category. As the continent with the\r\nlargest portion of the membership of our Organization,\r\nsuch a representation is well deserved. We also think\r\nthat the time has come to have a serious look at the\r\ncircumstances and modalities for invoking the use of\r\nveto powers. We are of the view that the veto power\r\nshould be used in pursuit of global interests, and not\r\nnarrow national interests.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, world leaders\r\nemphasized that the development agenda should\r\ncontinue to be at the centre of the objectives and\r\nactivities of the United Nations. We know that the\r\nUnited Nations is not a major funding institution, but\r\nover the years it has been the moral force behind the\r\nmany difficult decisions taken to address serious\r\neconomic issues. The United Nations organized several\r\nforums where various development agenda items were\r\ndiscussed and continue to be discussed, and decisions\r\ntaken. We want the United Nations to continue to do\r\nthat.\r\nIn a period of global economic slow-down like\r\nthe one we are witnessing today, the task of forging\r\nnew strategies to tackle the intractable problems of\r\npoverty, hunger, disease, deprivation and\r\nenvironmental degradation becomes very challenging\r\nindeed. We hope the current economic crisis will not\r\nlast long, because if it does its consequences may be\r\nbad for us all, especially the developing countries. I\r\nwould also add that Africa, as a continent with 34 of\r\nthe 48 least developed countries, will suffer the most.\r\nIn view of this situation, this world body, donor\r\ncountries and least developed countries must muster\r\ncollective efforts to ensure that these problems and\r\nmany more are addressed collectively. I know that\r\nthere can never be quick fixes to resolving such\r\nproblems. However, building those kinds of\r\npartnerships is one thing that the United Nations should\r\nhelp realize.\r\nThere is no doubt that for development to make\r\nsense in the context of the developing countries like\r\nTanzania, the availability of official development\r\nassistance (ODA), plus long-term capital flows and\r\naccess to technology and markets of the developed\r\ncountries, are essential. These will have a catalytic role\r\nin building domestic supply capacity.\r\nWe are particularly concerned that the situation\r\nwith regard to availability of ODA is still not\r\nencouraging. Most developed countries are far from\r\nmeeting the target of contributing 0.7 per cent of their\r\ngross domestic product to ODA, as agreed way back in\r\n1970 and reiterated at the 1992 Rio Summit. What is\r\nmore disturbing to us is the fact that the decline\r\ncontinues unabated despite numerous appeals. My\r\ndelegation would once again like to use this\r\nopportunity to call upon the developed countries to\r\nhonour this historic duty to mankind. We hope the\r\nUnited Nations will remain seized of the matter and\r\nexercise leadership.\r\nThe flow of foreign direct investment (FDI),\r\nwhich is so essential for inducing growth in our\r\nnations, leaves much to be desired. So far, the flow of\r\nFDI is not as we would have wanted or have expected\r\nit to be.\r\nThe painful part of this problem is the fact that\r\nmany of our countries have done everything that has\r\nbeen demanded of us in order to create a conducive\r\nenvironment for FDI to flow, yet there is not much of it\r\ncoming. Take the example of my country, where we\r\nhave established, through an Act of Parliament, a\r\nfinancial, legal and institutional framework as\r\nattractive and competitive as one would find anywhere\r\nin the world. We have a sound macroeconomic\r\nenvironment; there is political stability; and good\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\ngovernance and democracy are vibrant, yet foreign\r\ndirect investment flows are minimal.\r\nMy country’s experience is the experience of\r\nmany countries in the developing world. We are at a\r\nloss as to what else we have to do. Maybe someone\r\nwill volunteer to tell us. While we continue to appeal to\r\nthe developed countries to do more, we request the\r\nindulgence of the United Nations. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome and support the convening of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held next March. We hope that the\r\nquestion of ODA and FDI will be given appropriate\r\nconsideration. I promise Tanzania’s full participation in\r\nthat Conference.\r\nEasy access by the developing countries to the\r\ntechnology and markets of the developed world could\r\ncontribute immensely towards the alleviation and\r\neventual eradication of poverty in the world. There are\r\nencouraging developments in the area of market access,\r\nwith initiatives such as the Africa Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act (AGOA), which allows over 1,800\r\nproducts from countries of sub-Saharan Africa to enter\r\nthe United States market duty-free and quota-free, and\r\nthe Cotonou Agreement, which allows everything but\r\narms from the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and\r\nthe Pacific to enter the European Union duty-free and\r\nquota-free.\r\nWe hope the initiatives taken by Japan under the\r\nTokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment (TICAD) and by the People’s Republic of\r\nChina under the China-Africa Cooperation Forum will\r\ngo a little further and offer opportunities similar to\r\nthose offered under AGOA and the Cotonou\r\nAgreement. It is our sincere hope and expectation that\r\nthe four aforementioned initiatives by the United\r\nStates, the European Union, China and Japan will also\r\nease the difficulties experienced by our countries in\r\naccessing the financial, scientific and technological\r\nresources available in those nations. While our nations\r\nwill continue to engage the developed countries\r\nbilaterally or collectively in various forums, the United\r\nNations should never lose sight of the need to help us.\r\nThe problem of the external debt of developing\r\ncountries, and particularly of the least developed\r\ncountries, continues to pose a serious challenge to the\r\ndevelopment efforts of those countries. External debt\r\nservicing has been crowding out priority social\r\ninvestments in our respective countries. In Tanzania,\r\nfor example, debt servicing averaged one-third of the\r\nentire Government’s budget. With another one-third\r\nspent on payment of salaries, the Government is left\r\nwith only a third of the budget to perform its duties,\r\nwhich range from maintaining law and order to the\r\nprovision of basic social and economic services. This\r\nclearly underscores the fact that debt relief and debt\r\nforgiveness for nations like mine will go a long way\r\ntowards enhancing Government capacity to discharge\r\nits duties.\r\nIn this regard, Tanzania welcomes the various\r\nmeasures undertaken by the international community\r\naimed at dealing with this chronic debt problem. Our\r\nonly concern is that, despite all these measures, the\r\nscope and magnitude of debt is continuing to build up\r\nto dangerous proportions. More surgical measures\r\nshould therefore be taken to deal more effectively with\r\nthis crippling problem.\r\nLet me now turn to issues related to peace and\r\nsecurity. At the outset, let me state that it is\r\nheartwarming to see the Security Council more\r\nengaged in the process of trying to tackle the crisis in\r\nthe Great Lakes region. The Government of Tanzania is\r\ncommitted to building a secure and stable Great Lakes\r\nregion. In this regard, I want to assure the United\r\nNations that we will continue to play a positive role, as\r\nwe have been doing, in order to help the people of\r\nBurundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nsecure and enjoy the peace which they so richly\r\ndeserve.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, despite difficulties, the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Agreement is on track.\r\nWe are particularly glad that the inter-Congolese\r\ndialogue is under way. I would like to use this\r\nopportunity to appeal to the parties to the conflict to\r\nstay the course. We also appeal to the Security Council\r\nto remain seized of the matter, and to the international\r\ncommunity to extend the urgently needed financial\r\nresources to the facilitation of the dialogue.\r\nWe welcome the installation of the Transitional\r\nGovernment in Burundi. We hope that this historic\r\nevent, which marks the successful conclusion of long\r\nand arduous political negotiations, is also the\r\nbeginning of an irreversible process that will put an\r\nend to the long years of pain and suffering endured by\r\nthe people of Burundi. Indeed, the subregion continues\r\nto work towards the cessation of hostilities and towards\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nultimately securing a ceasefire agreement between the\r\nrebels and the Government. In this respect, I would like\r\nto take this opportunity to say three things.\r\nFirst, let me reiterate Tanzania’s previous calls\r\nfor the leaders of the Front for the Defence of\r\nDemocracy (FDD) and the National Liberation Forces\r\n(FNL) to see reason and to join the Arusha process. I\r\nbelieve that there is nothing they are fighting for which\r\nhas not been discussed and decided upon in the Arusha\r\nAgreement. Even if they feel strongly that something\r\nhas been excluded, the Arusha Agreement provides\r\nopportunities for discussion of the same by the parties.\r\nSecondly, Tanzania promises its readiness to\r\nwork with the new Government and to do all it can to\r\nhelp it succeed. We are ready to work with the new\r\nAdministration in Bujumbura and with the Front for\r\nDemocracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) to engage the\r\nrebels and encourage them to join the Arusha\r\nAgreement.\r\nThe third issue I would like to address relates to\r\nthe repatriation of Burundi refugees living in Tanzania.\r\nIt need not be emphasized that the return of refugees to\r\ntheir homeland is a crucial element in the healing and\r\nnormalization process in that troubled country. As host\r\nto over 800,000 refugees from Burundi, Tanzania\r\nexpects repatriation of these refugees to be among the\r\ntop priority issues in the implementation of the Arusha\r\nAgreement. It is our sincere hope that, in that exercise,\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR) will include not only the half a\r\nmillion people in the camps that they manage in\r\nKigoma and Ngara, but also the earlier caseloads of\r\nabout 300,000 they left to Tanzania to manage.\r\nIt is sad that Savimbi and his renegade UNITA\r\ncontinue to be a menace in Angola. The United Nations\r\nand the international community should do more to\r\nstop this menace. If action could be taken in Kosovo\r\nand Sierra Leone against criminal leaders, why not do\r\nthe same against Savimbi and UNITA? I believe it can\r\nbe done. Let us muster the political courage.\r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Tanzania\r\nreiterates its long-held position that this is a question of\r\ndecolonization and that the Sahrawi people have a right\r\nto decide on their future through a referendum, as\r\nstipulated in the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe fear that abandoning that path could lead to\r\nuntoward events.\r\nIt is regrettable that the situation in the Middle\r\nEast remains volatile and explosive. It is our hope that\r\nthe peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel\r\nwill be revived through a resolute commitment by all\r\nparties. The United Nations has a major role in\r\nensuring that the peace process gets back on track. The\r\ncommitment made by President Bush on the creation of\r\nthe state of Palestine on the basis of Security Council\r\nresolutions is very reassuring. We hope this will be\r\nfollowed through and that the United States\r\nGovernment will once again assume its leadership role.\r\nAs host country to the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda, we cannot but reiterate our call\r\nfor continued support for the Tribunal. It is gratifying\r\nthat the Tribunal’s mission of bringing to justice those\r\nresponsible for the genocide in Rwanda is well under\r\nway. Contrary to previous negative publicity, the\r\nTribunal is increasingly obtaining the appreciation and\r\ncredit it deserves for its work.\r\nI would be remiss if I were to conclude my\r\nremarks without saying a word about the debilitating\r\ndisease of HIV/AIDS. The impact of this worldwide\r\nscourge is not only a major scientific and medical\r\nchallenge, but a threat to the very existence of\r\nhumanity. Our leaders at the June special session\r\ndedicated to HIV/AIDS pronounced themselves on this\r\nscourge and on their resolve to fight it. Let me express\r\nour appreciation for the leadership role of the United\r\nNations, particularly the Secretary-General’s\r\ncommitment to combat this global crisis, from which\r\nno corner of this world is safe.\r\nI believe that, with resolute political will, the war\r\nagainst this world pandemic is not insurmountable.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jozias van Aartsen.\r\nMr. Van Aartsen (Netherlands): How can anyone\r\nstand on the smoking ashes of “ground zero” and not\r\nbe overwhelmed by disbelief, anger, and frustration?\r\nHow can anyone escape the enormity of what happened\r\nin September or not feel compassion for all those who\r\nhave lost someone dear to them? At “ground zero” we\r\nnot only witness death and destruction, but we also see\r\nhow American values have come under siege. These\r\nare shared values. That is why the people I represent\r\nnow stand squarely behind the United States.\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nNo matter how deeply moved we may be, we\r\nmust look beyond our anger and frustration. Through\r\nour tears, we should discover opportunity. Through our\r\nbitterness, necessity. We must turn compassion into\r\nsolidarity, turn solidarity into common action. We need\r\na plan — in sum, we must turn to the United Nations.\r\nThe reaction on the part of the United Nations\r\nfrom the beginning of this crisis has been prompt and\r\nresponsible. As we meet this week, we must try and\r\nkeep the momentum going. And that is precisely what\r\nwe are doing. There is something I have sensed in the\r\nfirst few days of this general debate — namely,\r\ndetermination — determination to use the United\r\nNations to the fullest, on many different fronts, as a\r\ncentre of gravity for our common actions — common\r\naction for confronting a global threat — common\r\naction to maintain the international order.\r\nWith regard to that common action, what have we\r\nlearned so far? Three lessons. Lesson number one: the\r\nlaw must be firmly in place. There is a wealth of legal\r\nrules to guide us in these difficult times, and more of\r\nthem are on the way. A striking example of innovative\r\nrule-making was presented by the Security Council.\r\nBinding under Chapter VII of the United Nations\r\nCharter, resolution 1373 (2001) takes action not in\r\nregard to a specific threat or breach of the peace, not\r\nagainst a particular Member State, but takes action to\r\nconfront a phenomenon, a threat to our human values\r\nand economic interests — action against unidentified\r\nenemies. By writing new law, the Council has broken\r\nnew ground. Even more so, as it has set up the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to monitor the\r\nimplementation of its decision.\r\nJointly with our partners in the European Union,\r\nwe are taking the implementation of resolution 1373\r\n(2001) very seriously. One aspect of it is especially\r\nimportant to us: promoting ratification of all of the\r\nvarious anti-terrorism conventions and monitoring\r\ncompliance. My country has some expertise to offer\r\nand will gladly share it. Meanwhile, an overarching\r\nconvention against terrorism is in the works. That is\r\ngood. But we are getting bogged down over a\r\ndefinition of terrorism. That is bad. Let us not forget\r\nthat it took us 20 years to produce a fairly useless\r\ndefinition of aggression. The world cannot wait that\r\nlong. Besides, when terrorism stares you in the face,\r\nyou’ll know it.\r\nIn addition to rule-making, the real challenge lies\r\nin implementation. There, we should try harder. Let me\r\ngive you one example. Just before the summer we lost\r\nour momentum in the fight against biological warfare,\r\nand therefore the fight against bio-terrorism as well.\r\nThe world is a scary place. Anthrax is only one motive\r\nfor retrieving that momentum. Let us resume our\r\nefforts to turn the Biological Weapons Convention into\r\nan instrument that can really make a difference.\r\nThe need for stepping up security is immediate,\r\ncomprehensive and self-evident. In the aftermath of 11\r\nSeptember, nobody would deny it. But we need to be\r\nconcerned with the downside of security as well. Parts\r\nof our value system may come under pressure when\r\nGovernments seek to bolster public safety, and by this I\r\nmean human rights and fundamental freedoms. As\r\nprivate citizens we must be ready to make concessions\r\nand, yes, we will be forced to relinquish some freedom\r\nfrom intrusion in our private lives. But we cannot be\r\nexpected to live in a never-ending state of siege.\r\nWherever we have to strike a balance, we have to do so\r\nwisely. Long ago, we drew a line beyond which we\r\ncannot step — we cannot detract from the basic\r\nprinciples of human rights. Those principles are the\r\ntrue measure of our evolution and our civilization. If\r\nwe look the other way, we lose the moral high ground.\r\nIf we compromise, we lose out to those who besiege us.\r\nWhat is being put to the test here is our own\r\nvalue system. The core notion of that system is\r\ntolerance. Tolerance must, however, come from all\r\nsides. Tolerance is not the equivalent of giving in to\r\nintolerance. It does not imply that you bend at the\r\nslightest pressure. Tolerance means that you stand up to\r\nbe counted, that you draw a line in the sand when your\r\nbasic values are challenged. That is lesson number one.\r\nLesson number two: there are “black holes” in the\r\ninternational order: failing States. We knew they were\r\nthere all along, but we have never been quite sure how\r\nto deal with them. Why should we care about failing\r\nStates? For several reasons. Look at the avalanche of\r\ndrugs, drug-money, weapons, and warlords spilling out\r\nof Afghanistan. Look at the blood diamonds streaming\r\nout of Africa. Think of how failing States attract\r\nparasites and how they turn into breeding grounds for\r\nterrorism, a haven for international crime. Think of\r\npeace and security, too; of how faltering countries\r\nbecome a liability to their own people; of how they\r\nflaunt the rules of the game and become a liability to\r\nthe whole neighbourhood.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nHow do we deal with failing States? That\r\nquestion has never been answered in a systematic\r\nmanner. Any answer begins by recognition on the part\r\nof the Member States of this Organization that failing\r\nStates are a problem. Indeed, it may turn out to be the\r\nmost pernicious problem of the new century. From that\r\npoint on, we need to build a strategy, and do so\r\ntogether, within the framework of this Organization.\r\nWhat are we aiming at? How ambitious are we?\r\nCan we get in early to prevent failing States from\r\nfailing? Are there any early warning signals to look out\r\nfor? If we see those signals, do we have the means to\r\nact? And the political will? Once States are failing, do\r\nwe try and fix them? Do we settle for ending the\r\nfighting, wherever fighting is going on? Or do we limit\r\nourselves to humanitarian aid? These are all difficult\r\nquestions.\r\nMy belief is that outside intervention only goes so\r\nfar. I do not believe that massive injections of aid are\r\nthe right answer to failing States. For one thing, donors\r\nare reluctant to poor money down a black hole. But\r\nmore importantly: the solution should not come from\r\nthe outside, but rather from the inside. Even in the\r\npoorest country we will find well-educated citizens just\r\nas committed to building better lives for their children\r\nas in the rest of the world. They need a helping hand in\r\nbuilding good governance and a viable civil society.\r\nYet, ownership is paramount. Failing States, too, have\r\nthe capacity to fix themselves. Indeed, only if they fix\r\nthemselves will they no longer fail. Our role should be\r\nto help galvanize and to enable those capacities.\r\nLesson number three: the United Nations should\r\nbe doing the right things. As of today the Northern\r\nAlliance has entered the city of Kabul. That fact makes\r\nit even more imperative that we speak about\r\nAfghanistan in the United Nations.\r\nConsensus is growing that in post-Taliban\r\nAfghanistan, the United Nations should play a central\r\nrole. I certainly support that view. But a central role in\r\nwhat? For make no mistake: once the bombing stops,\r\nthe difficulties are still overwhelming. The country is\r\nnot only rugged and ruined, but also the size of Central\r\nEurope and packed with landmines. Factional fighting\r\nis bound to continue. The United Nations can do a lot,\r\nbut we need to beware of sending the United Nations\r\non an impossible mission. Instead of calling on the\r\nUnited Nations for functions where it is weak, let us\r\ncall on the United Nations for functions where it is\r\nstrong.\r\nFor example, take governance, a major worry to\r\nus all. Much as we seek to avoid it, a political vacuum\r\nis a realistic prospect, given that tribal conflict in\r\nAfghanistan is as old as the country’s history. Afghans\r\nare a proud people. Hostility towards outside\r\nintervention is strong. The country needs to be\r\ngoverned from within. We may be looking both for a\r\nbroad-based interim Government and for a stable\r\npermanent structure. Without rushing to elections, we\r\nneed to be satisfied that such a political settlement is\r\nsupported by the population. In the process, the United\r\nNations might play a central role as a catalyst and as an\r\nadviser, but not as a governor. Afghanistan is not East\r\nTimor. It is important, too, that any settlement be\r\nsupported by the neighbouring States and by a Security\r\nCouncil resolution.\r\nAs regards security: in the absence of a functional\r\nnational army, transitional military arrangements are\r\nessential. They are essential to create a secure\r\nenvironment enabling reconstruction to begin and\r\nrefugees to return home. Choosing the right format is\r\ncritical. A conventional United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperation may not be a good idea — certainly not for\r\nthe country as a whole. Supplying peacekeepers is still\r\nvoluntary. Realistically, the troop levels needed for a\r\ncountry this size would almost certainly not be\r\nattained. Bosnia has taught us the hard lesson of the\r\nprice we pay when we send in a United Nations force\r\nthat is below par. We should be careful to avoid another\r\nSomalia. Different formats for security arrangements\r\nare possible, and we should reflect on them as a whole.\r\nIn a previous context, Ambassador Brahimi has offered\r\nus a wide spectrum of lessons learned about United\r\nNations peacekeeping. We should take them to heart.\r\nNow, as the Special Representative, he deserves all the\r\nsupport he needs from us.\r\nConcerning mine clearance: Afghanistan has\r\nmore landmines than any other country in the world.\r\nThe country cannot possibly get back on its feet as long\r\nas those mines are there. We have to get rid of them,\r\nand the United Nations can help us to do that. We must\r\npay the bills.\r\nAs to reconstruction: we should capitalize on\r\nwhere the United Nations is uniquely positioned either\r\nto deploy operations in the field or to coordinate those\r\nof others. Let us not limit our view to the part of the\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nUnited Nations here in New York, but rather broaden it\r\nto the entire United Nations system, including the\r\nDumbarton Oaks and Bretton Woods institutions. We\r\nneed to bring the full weight of that system to bear on\r\nthe future of Afghanistan. I am speaking of the World\r\nHealth Organization and the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, of the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\nand the United Nations Drug Control Programme, of\r\nthe International Labour Organization and the World\r\nFood Programme, of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the World Bank. There is no need to\r\nset up a whole new mechanism. The Afghanistan\r\nSupport Group is fully entrenched, and we should use\r\nit.\r\nEspecially now, caught in the crossfire, the\r\nAfghan people are not to be envied. Their plight will\r\nnot be over once the guns are silent. Food stocks,\r\nhealth care, housing, utilities, schooling, agriculture —\r\nthe list of concerns is a long one. But all of us need to\r\npush that agenda. We may not be part of the problem of\r\nAfghanistan, but we must be part of the solution.\r\nYet again, reconstruction cannot be imposed upon\r\na nation. Here, too, a sustainable recovery needs to\r\ncome from within. All the men, and especially the\r\nwomen of Afghanistan, must once again become the\r\nmakers of their own fate and future. The answer lies\r\nwith them.\r\nThe United Nations is not merely “an ineffective\r\nacronym”, as a misguided message on the Internet\r\nwould have you believe. For global issues, multilateral\r\ncooperation is the only answer. Multilateralism is\r\nsolidarity worked into a plan. As I said, the reaction by\r\nthe United Nations system in the aftermath of 11\r\nSeptember has been prompt and responsible. In order\r\nto maintain that level of performance, we, the Member\r\nStates, will have to show the stamina, support and\r\ncommitment to make it happen. Our track record is not\r\nimpeccable. The United Nations can go no faster than\r\nwe will let it, which means we have to make it work.\r\nThis also means we have to provide it with all the\r\nresources, and the political will, to give it the push and\r\npunch we need.\r\nThe President: I call on the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Guinea, Her Excellency\r\nMs. Mahawa Bangoura Camara.\r\nMs. Camara (Guinea) (spoke in French): I\r\nshould like to associate my country and delegation with\r\nthe expressions of sympathy for the great suffering\r\nendured by the city of New York following the crash of\r\nthe American Airlines plane yesterday. To the\r\nGovernment of the United States, our host city and all\r\nthe bereaved families, I address the condolences of the\r\nGovernment and people of Guinea.\r\nA year ago in this Hall, the great leaders of the\r\nworld, in a unanimous surge, committed themselves to\r\nthinking together about the role of this Organization,\r\nthe United Nations, in the twenty-first century, and\r\nabout ways of achieving its objectives fully, with a\r\nview to constructing together a world of peace,\r\nprogress and solidarity. The historic Declaration which\r\nemerged from the Millennium Summit emphasized the\r\nneed to open a new era of international relations.\r\nIt was when the international community was\r\npreparing to review the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations and decisions of that Summit that\r\nunprecedented terrorist acts cast a shadow over our\r\nhopes. These acts, to which the United States fell\r\nvictim on 11 September 2001, profoundly shocked the\r\nconscience of all peoples. The barbarity and violence\r\nof these terrorist attacks, and also the threat of\r\nbioterrorism, are serious attacks on international peace\r\nand security.\r\nMy delegation would like once again to express\r\nits sympathy to the American people, especially the\r\nfamilies of the many victims. The Republic of Guinea\r\ncondemns those intolerable acts and believes that it\r\nshould be the concern of all States to combat and\r\neradicate terrorism. We firmly support any measures\r\naimed at eliminating the bases of international\r\nterrorism and fully associate ourselves with the\r\ninternational community in its global response to that\r\nscourge.\r\nThe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\r\nis thus taking place within the context of a new and\r\nalarming situation for international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation is therefore very pleased to see you, Sir,\r\npresiding over the Assembly during this session. We\r\nare convinced that your wealth of experience, as well\r\nas your great diplomatic skill, will ensure the success\r\nof our discussions. I would like to assure you of the\r\ncooperation and support of the delegation of Guinea.\r\nI should also like to thank your predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the excellent work accomplished\r\nunder his presidency.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nMy delegation would like once again to convey\r\nthe warm congratulations of General Lansana Conté,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea, to our brother,\r\nKofi Annan, on his well-deserved re-election as the\r\nhead of our Organization. The unanimous tribute that\r\nhas been paid to him brings honour to the whole of the\r\nAfrican continent and bears witness to his great\r\nqualities and his commitment to achieving the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations. The Nobel Peace\r\nPrize recently awarded jointly to him and to the\r\nOrganization is eloquent testimony to that commitment\r\nand an encouragement to continue to act in the service\r\nof peace and understanding among peoples.\r\nThe award of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize to the\r\nUnited Nations is, without doubt, a recognition of its\r\nrole in the implementation of its objectives — the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security,\r\ndevelopment and cooperation among nations.\r\nIncreasingly, the Organization is proving to be the\r\nnecessary crucible for dialogue among States.\r\nHowever, almost all Members earnestly desire the\r\nstrengthening and improvement of the entire system.\r\nWhile reaffirming its support for the reform\r\nprocess initiated by the Secretary-General, my country,\r\nthe Republic of Guinea, would like to emphasize the\r\nneed to strengthen the principal organs of the\r\nOrganization. We welcome the actions taken by your\r\npredecessor, Sir, to streamline the working methods of\r\nthe General Assembly so as to give it fresh dynamism.\r\nWe hope that that impetus will continue.\r\nMy delegation would also like to reaffirm its\r\nsupport for restructuring the Security Council, in its\r\nmembership as well as its working methods, so as to\r\nenable it to better protect the interests of all Member\r\nStates. I should like to take this opportunity to express,\r\non behalf of my Government, our gratitude to all States\r\nfor the unanimous support that enabled Guinea to be\r\nelected a non-permanent member of the Security\r\nCouncil for 2002 and 2003. During its mandate, the\r\nRepublic of Guinea will make every effort to contribute\r\nactively to the maintenance of peace and security in the\r\nworld.\r\nPeace and security continue to be threatened in\r\nmany parts of the world. In the Middle East,\r\nintolerance and intransigence have led to a dangerous\r\nescalation of violence, which, if not controlled in time,\r\ncould cause the whole region to go up in flames. The\r\nRepublic of Guinea would like to appeal to all the\r\nparties to exercise greater restraint so as to facilitate a\r\nresumption of the peace process. My country supports\r\nthe full application of the recommendations of the\r\nMitchell commission and the implementation of\r\neffective follow-up mechanisms. Dispatching\r\ninternational observers could contribute to ending the\r\nviolence and returning peace to all the peoples there.\r\nHowever, the indifference of the international\r\ncommunity and its failure to take action could, in the\r\nlong term, prove to be prejudicial to security in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nMy delegation condemns all acts of violence,\r\nwhich can lead only to a worsening of the situation. In\r\nthe light of the serious events that have taken place in\r\nrecent months, the international community must do all\r\nthat it can to lead all parties to accept a ceasefire and to\r\nresume the peace process. Arms must give way to\r\ndialogue, which should lead to a just, equitable and\r\nlasting peace. The legitimate rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople should be respected. Likewise, the existence\r\nand security of Israel must be guaranteed.\r\nOne year ago, my country became the victim of\r\naggression committed by rebel groups. That barbaric\r\naggression caused great loss of life and material\r\ndamage. My Government would like to express its full\r\nappreciation for the subsequent role played by the\r\nUnited Nations in adopting appropriate measures to\r\ncreate conditions conducive to the restoration of peace\r\nand stability in the subregion. My delegation would\r\nalso like to take this opportunity to thank all the\r\nindividuals and States that contributed to the adoption\r\nand implementation of those measures. One year later,\r\nthe fact that a dialogue has been initiated by civil\r\nsociety in the three countries concerned — Sierra\r\nLeone, Liberia and Guinea — means that we have\r\nreached an important stage in the search for peace.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea, which has always shown\r\nits determination to maintain and strengthen friendship,\r\nbrotherhood and cooperation with all African countries\r\nin general and neighbouring countries in particular,\r\nwould like to reaffirm to the Assembly its readiness to\r\nmake the Mano River Union a model of economic\r\nintegration, social cohesion and political stability.\r\nHowever, relaunching the activities of the Union\r\nwill depend upon respect for the relevant provisions of\r\nthe Non-aggression and Security Cooperation Treaty\r\nsigned by the three countries and of the 15th Protocol\r\nto the Mano River Declaration, signed at Conakry on 8\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nMay 2000. That is what is required for productive\r\ndialogue among the three countries.\r\nIn the framework of the process of re-establishing\r\nconfidence and dialogue among the countries members\r\nof the Mano River Union, meetings have been held at\r\nthe ministerial level in Monrovia, Freetown and\r\nConakry. Those meetings made it possible to discuss\r\nimportant problems relating to the activities of armed\r\ngroups in the subregion, the situation of refugees,\r\nmeasures to rebuild confidence, peace and security, and\r\nthe need to reactivate the various bodies of the Mano\r\nRiver Union.\r\nMy Government welcomes the encouraging\r\ndevelopments in Sierra Leone, particularly the\r\nprogramme for disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration (DDR). The DDR programme that has\r\nbeen implemented will have to be consolidated if it is\r\nto lead to the true demobilization of all the\r\nRevolutionary United Front combatants and if the\r\nmistakes made in Liberia are to be avoided. In Liberia,\r\nthe restoration of peace after 10 years of civil war has\r\nnot, unfortunately, been accompanied by a true DDR\r\nprogramme or by post-conflict financial support.\r\nI would like to express regret with regard to the\r\ninadequate results of the Paris conference convened to\r\ndeal with the problem of Sierra Leone, and to call on\r\nthe international community to provide the necessary\r\nmaterial and financial support to guarantee lasting\r\npeace in that country. My delegation bases its appeal\r\non the relevant recommendations contained in the\r\nBrahimi report, which have been accepted by the\r\nprincipal organs of the Organization. The Republic of\r\nGuinea will continue to support the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States in restoring peace, security and national\r\nreconciliation in Sierra Leone.\r\nThe question of refugees is still a matter of great\r\nconcern for my Government. The enormous economic,\r\nsocial, environmental and security impact of the\r\ncontinued presence of hundreds of thousands of Sierra\r\nLeonean and Liberian refugees continues to impose a\r\nheavy burden on the economic and social life of my\r\ncountry. The situation of the refugees is a matter of\r\ngreat concern for the international community at a time\r\nwhen rebel attacks against my country are being\r\ncarried out, as the countries hosting refugees are the\r\nmain target of the aggressors. Following this\r\naggression, the Government took appropriate measures,\r\nin cooperation with the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, to relocate refugees\r\nin zones far from the borders in order to ensure their\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on strengthening\r\nof the coordination of emergency humanitarian\r\nassistance amply describes the context of humanitarian\r\nassistance and the difficulties to be overcome,\r\nparticularly in complex emergency situations.\r\nWe welcome the missions undertaken in the\r\nsubregion of West Africa by various United Nations\r\nbodies, as well as the conclusions they reached. While\r\nthe resolution of most issues identified by those\r\nmissions requires an integrated approach, it is\r\nnonetheless true that problems peculiar to certain\r\ncountries require particular attention. With respect to\r\nGuinea, a victim of the consequences of the conflicts in\r\nthe subregion, it would be desirable for the\r\ninternational community to provide greater support. In\r\nthat regard, I wish to reiterate the appeal to convene a\r\nconference on solidarity with Guinea in order to help it\r\naddress the consequences of the prolonged presence of\r\nrefugees on its territory. I would stress that this appeal\r\nof the Guinean Government is supported by the United\r\nNations inter-agency mission that recently visited our\r\ncountry.\r\nBefore I conclude on this topic, I wish to\r\nwelcome the proposal to create a United Nations office\r\nfor West Africa, in accordance with the\r\nrecommendation of the Fall mission report. The\r\ncreation of such a body would demonstrate the\r\nOrganization’s clear interest in making the West\r\nAfrican region a zone of peace, security and\r\ncooperation. My country will spare no effort in\r\ncooperating fully with that office.\r\nHow can we discuss the conflicts in Africa\r\nwithout highlighting the links between the illegal\r\nexploitation of natural resources, the traffic in weapons\r\nand the perpetuation of conflict? The reports of the\r\nvarious groups of experts established by the Security\r\nCouncil are edifying on this subject. In Sierra Leone,\r\nAngola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nthese links have clearly shown the involvement, in\r\naddition to rebel groups, of certain authorities in that\r\nillegal activity.\r\nMy Government therefore fully supports the\r\nactions of the Security Council to impose sanctions\r\nagainst any Government or group involved in the\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\npillaging of a country’s natural resources, in\r\naccordance with the relevant provisions of international\r\nlaw. The Republic of Guinea feels that if energetic\r\ndeterrent measures are not taken against the\r\nperpetrators of such crimes, which are emerging as a\r\nnew kind of threat to peace, the entire African\r\ncontinent may once again fall victim to conflict.\r\nWith regard to the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, my country calls for scrupulous respect for the\r\nLusaka Agreement and for all pertinent Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, and in particular for the\r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops, safeguarding the integrity\r\nof Congolese territory and the pursuit of the inter-\r\nCongolese dialogue.\r\nIn the Western Sahara, my country welcomes the\r\nefforts of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General.\r\nWe are following with great interest the new initiatives\r\nunder way to find an acceptable solution to the crisis.\r\nThe phenomenon of globalization, characteristic\r\nof international life today, calls for greater attention\r\nfrom our States. My delegation is aware of the\r\nnecessary interdependence of nations and wishes once\r\nagain to stress that there can be no shared destiny\r\nwithout a minimum of justice and solidarity in\r\ninternational relations. We must work together to make\r\ninternational economic relations more human and to\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nThere is no need here to point out that poverty,\r\ndestitution and illiteracy, which are unfortunately the\r\nlot of a large majority of nations, provide fertile ground\r\nfor the propagation of the extremism and fanaticism\r\nthat, regrettably, underlie terrorist tendencies\r\nthroughout the world. The eradication of poverty\r\nshould be the objective of all countries in strengthening\r\nthe bases of lasting peace and security in the world.\r\nAllow me to reiterate the appeal to the rich\r\ncountries to listen more closely to the poorer nations\r\nand to support them in their development efforts. In\r\nthis respect, I renew the appeal for the adoption of a\r\nbetter approach to the question of the debt of African\r\ncountries, for appropriate payment for raw materials\r\nand for an increase in official development assistance.\r\nOn another level, the Marrakesh Agreement\r\nestablishing the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nsought to institute an equitable multilateral trade\r\nsystem with special reference to the particular situation\r\nof the least developed countries. It is regrettable to note\r\ntoday, however, that the least developed countries are\r\nbeing increasingly marginalized in the globalization\r\nprocess and that their share of the world trade market is\r\nonly 0.4 per cent.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea hopes that this trend will\r\nbe reversed and that decisions to that end will be taken\r\nat the fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha.\r\nThese decisions will have to address, inter alia, the\r\nissue of the implementation of WTO accords, the\r\nconsolidation of special and differentiated treatment set\r\nforth in the various WTO agreements, consolidated\r\nmarket access for the products of the least developed\r\ncountries to the markets of the developed countries,\r\nand access to essential drugs for the poorest\r\npopulations of the world that are particularly\r\nvulnerable to HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. I\r\nalso welcome the People’s Republic of China’s\r\naccession to full membership of the WTO and reiterate\r\nthe support of the Guinean Government for the position\r\npositing a single China.\r\nIn addition, we would like to see the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nin March in Mexico, become an opportunity for all\r\nparties to agree on solutions promoting sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all members of the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the developing countries and\r\nespecially those on the African continent.\r\nIn stressing the interdependence of\r\nenvironmental, economic and social factors, my\r\ndelegation feels that the forthcoming World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, to be held in South Africa,\r\nshould encourage the financing of projects. My\r\ndelegation urges greater involvement by the\r\ninternational financial institutions in the search for\r\nways to promote international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment. In the framework of operational activities\r\nfor development, the funds and programmes of the\r\nUnited Nations must more than ever harmonize and\r\nstress their interaction on the African continent so as to\r\nallow it to rise above conflict and underdevelopment.\r\nI also take this opportunity to appeal to the\r\ninternational community to give special attention to the\r\nNew African Initiative, adopted at the recent Assembly\r\nof Heads of State and Government of the Organization\r\nof African Unity, held in Lusaka in July, in order to\r\nhelp Africa to participate actively in the world\r\neconomy and international political life and thus to\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nescape exclusion from a planet undergoing full-scale\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe United Nations was born last century. It\r\ncontinues to exist in this new century. This is a source\r\nof satisfaction to humanity. It is therefore essential that\r\nwe return to the ideals on which the Organization was\r\nfounded and that we give it the means to achieve a\r\nworld of peace, progress, solidarity and concord. The\r\nachievement of such a world is possible if we want it.\r\nLet us work together to make the noble ideals\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration a reality so\r\nthat we may lay the foundations of a planetary village\r\nfree of threats to the survival of mankind, such as the\r\nscourge of war, poverty, injustice and intolerance. I can\r\nsolemnly assure the Assembly that my country will\r\ncooperate to achieve that end.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nBefore delivering my statement, I would like to express\r\nour condolences to the United States, the Dominican\r\nRepublic and other countries represented here that have\r\nlost citizens among the many passengers and crew\r\nmembers who perished in yesterday’s tragic crash of\r\nAmerican Airlines flight 587, and I hereby extend these\r\ncondolences to their families.\r\nThe war in Afghanistan must be stopped. The\r\nGovernment of the United States must acknowledge\r\nthat it has made a mistake, and must halt its ineffective,\r\nunjustifiable bombing campaign against the Afghan\r\npeople.\r\nJudging by its results, it would seem that this war\r\nhas targeted children, the civilian population and the\r\nhospitals and facilities of the International Committee\r\nof the Red Cross. As to its methods, no honest voice\r\nwould be raised in this Hall to defend the endless\r\nslaughter, with the most sophisticated weaponry, of a\r\ndispossessed, starving, helpless people. As to its\r\ndoubtful purposes, this war will never be justified from\r\nthe point of view of ethics and international law. Those\r\nresponsible for it will one day be judged by history.\r\nCuba has opposed this war from the very\r\nbeginning as an absurd, inefficient method to eradicate\r\nterrorism, and reiterates that it can only bring more\r\nhatred and ever-increasing dangers of new actions of\r\nthis kind. No one has the right to continue murdering\r\nchildren, aggravating the humanitarian crisis and\r\nvisiting impoverishment and death on millions of\r\nrefugees.\r\nIf the United States obtained a military victory by\r\neliminating all regular and irregular Afghan\r\nresistance — something that is not at all easy in\r\npractice and extremely costly on a moral level, for it\r\nwould represent a real genocide without attaining the\r\nobjective that we must pursue — the world would be\r\nfarther away than ever from achieving peace, security\r\nand the eradication of terrorism.\r\nCuba’s discourse is not founded on ill feelings\r\nagainst the country that has been our most pitiless\r\nadversary for over 40 years. It is inspired by a sincere,\r\nconstructive spirit and a sense of respect for and\r\nsympathy towards the people of the United States,\r\nwhich suffered an unjustifiable and atrocious terrorist\r\nattack. It is also based on the aspiration for peace and\r\njustice for all the peoples of the world.\r\nWhat Cuba expresses in this Hall, with full\r\nopenness, may not be to the liking of those who run the\r\nUnited States today, but it will be understood one day\r\nby the American people, whose generosity and sense of\r\njustice were proved to the Cuban people when it had\r\nthe support of 80 percent of the public opinion in this\r\ncountry in our struggle to prevent a kidnapped Cuban\r\nchild from being torn away from his family and\r\nsubjected to ludicrous political manipulations and cruel\r\npsychological tortures.\r\nWhat Cuba is saying from this rostrum, as we\r\nwell know, is what many people have been saying in\r\nthe corridors of this building. What international\r\ncoalition are we talking about? What is its legitimacy\r\nbased on if it has started by scandalously disregarding\r\nthe General Assembly? The United States has not\r\nfostered international cooperation. It has rather\r\nimposed its war on a unilateral basis and has stated in\r\nan unprecedented way that whoever does not second\r\nthem is for terrorism. How long will the precarious\r\nsupport obtained last, since it is not based on\r\nharmonized objectives and voluntary agreement, but on\r\nthe imposition of will through threats and pressures?\r\nYou can be the strongest, but not necessarily\r\nright. You can inspire dread, but not sympathy and\r\nrespect. Only from genuine international\r\ncooperation — in which all countries, big and small,\r\nparticipate with a full understanding of everyone’s\r\npositions, with broadmindedness and tolerance in the\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nmethods used, within the framework of the United\r\nNations and the strict respect for the principles\r\nenshrined in its Charter — can a truly effective and\r\nlasting alliance emerge to fight terrorism.\r\nThe world was surprised to learn of the official\r\nannouncement of the United States to the Security\r\nCouncil that it reserved the right to decide on an attack\r\nagainst other countries in the future. What is left of the\r\nCharter after this? Can this unprecedented threat by\r\nany chance be interpreted as an exercise of the right to\r\nlegitimate defence, enshrined in the Charter as the right\r\nof a State to deal with acts of aggression until the\r\nCouncil adopts the necessary measures, and not as a\r\nvulgar excuse to unleash attacks against other\r\ncountries? Is this announcement, or is it not, the\r\nproclamation of the right of a super-Power to trample\r\nupon the still fragile and incomplete standards that\r\nprotect the sovereignty, security and rights of peoples?\r\nCuba calmly and firmly rejects that language. We\r\nhave not done so out of concern for our own security,\r\nbecause there is no power in the world that can subdue\r\nour spirit of independence, freedom and social justice\r\nand the courage to defend it at any cost. We did so,\r\nbecause we believe that it is still possible to halt the\r\nescalation of a useless, brutal war that threatens to\r\nfurther plunge into hopelessness, insecurity and death\r\nthe poor peoples of the planet, who are by no means\r\nresponsible for any act of terrorism, but will be — and\r\nalready are — the main victims of this senselessness.\r\nOnly under the leadership of the United Nations\r\nwill we be able to defeat terrorism. Cooperation, and\r\nnot war, is the way. The coordination of actions, and\r\nnot the imposition of will, is the method. Our objective\r\nmust be to obliterate terrorism by removing its root\r\ncauses — and not the hegemonic assertion of the\r\nstrength of a super-Power, thus turning us into\r\naccomplices to its arrogance and arbitrariness.\r\nTherefore, Cuba — which has already responded\r\nto the Secretary-General’s appeal by deciding to\r\nimmediately ratify all of the international legal\r\ninstruments on terrorism — resolutely supports the\r\nadoption of a general convention on international\r\nterrorism. Of course, this will be possible only in the\r\ncontext of the General Assembly, which — though now\r\ncompletely ignored by those who are promoting the\r\nnew campaign — has, over the past 10 years, despite\r\nthe silence and apathy of the Security Council, adopted\r\nthe principal resolutions and declarations calling for an\r\noutright combat against terrorism.\r\nThis will allow us finally to define terrorism with\r\naccuracy. We have to prevent attempts from being\r\nmade by a handful of actors with vested interests to try\r\nto label as such the right of nations to fight for their\r\nself-determination or against foreign aggression. It\r\nmust be clearly established that the support, abetting,\r\nfinancing or concealment of terrorist actions by a State\r\nis also an act of terrorism.\r\nCuba, which is working on its own anti-terrorism\r\nlaw, which should be in effect shortly, unreservedly\r\nendorses the proposal to convene an international\r\nconference on terrorism under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations. This has been a longtime aspiration of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and should enable us, as a\r\nresult of open discussions, collective action and\r\nrespectful and non-discriminatory agreement — and\r\nnot of threats, terror or force — to find a way to fully\r\neliminate terrorism and its causes. Here I am speaking\r\nof terrorism committed not only against the United\r\nStates but against any other country — even if\r\nemanating from the territory of the United States, or\r\ntolerated by, or with the complicity of, its authorities,\r\nas has been Cuba’s painful experience for over four\r\ndecades.\r\nOnly four days ago, the Pakistani media\r\nattributed to a character who is well known and very\r\nfamiliar to the United States a statement supposedly\r\nmade from Afghan territory saying that he has\r\nchemical and nuclear weapons and is threatening to use\r\nthem against the United States if it uses similar\r\nweapons against Afghanistan.\r\nEverybody knows that Afghanistan does not have\r\nthe slightest ability to produce or launch nuclear or\r\nchemical weapons. Only a terrorist organization or\r\nleader could come up with the idea of executing an\r\naction of this kind using nuclear or chemical weapons.\r\nOf course, theoretically this could be possible, as a\r\nconsequence of the irresponsible behaviour of the\r\nmajor nuclear Powers and as a result of the arms trade,\r\ncorruption and illegal trafficking in all sorts of military\r\ntechnology. Indeed, several of those Powers have acted\r\nas accomplices to, and taken part in, the traffic in\r\nfissile material and the transfer of nuclear technology,\r\nas suits their interests. However, in reality, given the\r\nconditions of war in Afghanistan, it would be\r\nridiculous to resort to those threats. To do so would be\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nto show tremendous political and military ignorance. If\r\none lacked such means, this would be a dangerous\r\nbluff, and if one did have them, it would be absolute\r\nmadness to threaten to use them.\r\nIf the threats contained in the statement published\r\nby two Pakistani newspapers are true, they deserve the\r\nstrongest condemnation, as would the eventual use of\r\nsuch weapons against Afghanistan. That would be a\r\nstupid reaction, since, under those circumstances, the\r\nonly thing that poor, suffering country would have to\r\ngain would be a universal condemnation of the use of\r\nsuch weapons. Such threats serve only the interests of\r\nthe extremist and belligerent forces within the United\r\nStates, which favour the use of the most sophisticated\r\nweapons of mass destruction against the Afghan\r\npeople. The best weapon for a country that is the\r\nvictim of aggression is to earn and keep the sympathy\r\nof the world, and not to allow anyone to violate the\r\nethical principle that no one has the right to kill\r\nchildren, not even if others are doing it. There is no\r\njustice in killing innocent people to avenge the death of\r\nother innocents.\r\nCuba has stated without hesitation that it is\r\nopposed to terrorism and to war. Cuba, which is not\r\nunder obligation to anyone, will continue to be\r\nconsistent in its positions. Truth and ethical\r\nconsiderations should prevail above all else.\r\nThe way events have unfolded, the increased\r\nlevel of hatred and the intensification of passions and\r\npotential dangers have shown the absolute truth of the\r\nassertion that war has never been, is not, and never will\r\nbe the way to eradicate terrorism.\r\nThe most critical socio-economic crisis ever —\r\nthe result, halfway through the last decade, of the\r\nresounding and irreversible failure of neo-liberalism\r\nand neo-liberal globalization — has been dramatically\r\naggravated by this war, which was imposed by one side\r\nbut whose consequences we all have to bear.\r\nThis war must be stopped, not only because its\r\nconsequences for the Afghan civilian population, but\r\nalso because of the danger of destabilization in that\r\nregion. It must be stopped in order not only to save\r\nthousands of Americans — mostly young — and\r\nthousands of Afghans and other nationals from a\r\nsenseless death, and not only to preserve international\r\npeace and stability, but because this conflict makes it\r\nimpossible to achieve the objective set by the United\r\nNations 15 years ago: the right to development for all,\r\nand an equal opportunity to attain it, and because it\r\nrenders obsolete the decision made only a year ago to\r\nwork together in order to eliminate poverty from the\r\nface of the Earth.\r\nWill we be willing to organize a coalition against\r\npoverty, famine, ignorance, diseases and the scourge of\r\nAIDS that is currently decimating the African\r\ncontinent; a coalition for sustainable development, for\r\nthe preservation of the environment and against the\r\ndestruction of the planet?\r\nA coalition has been assembled to avenge the\r\ngrievous and unjustifiable death of over 4,000 innocent\r\npeople in the United States. Let us come together to\r\nseek justice for this great crime — and let us do so\r\nwithout war; let us come together to save from death\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of poor women who die\r\nduring childbirth every year; let us come together to\r\nsave from death the 12 million children who die of\r\npreventable diseases before the age of 5 every year in\r\nthe third world; let us come together to bring medicine\r\nfor AIDS to the 25 million Africans who today are\r\nhopelessly awaiting death; let us come together to\r\ninvest in development at least a portion of the billions\r\nalready spent on bombing a country in which almost\r\nnothing has been left standing.\r\nCuba demands that the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the United Nations Organization\r\nas a whole take up once again, as top priorities, the\r\ndebate of these problems on which depend the lives of\r\n4.5 billion inhabitants of the third world, whose rights\r\nand hopes have also been buried under the rubble of\r\nthe World Trade Center.\r\nCuba reiterates its categorical condemnation of\r\nthe terrorist acts committed last 11 September. Cuba\r\nreiterates its condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations. Cuba reiterates that it will not\r\nallow its territory ever to be used for terrorist acts\r\nagainst the people of the United States or of any other\r\ncountry.\r\nCuba has the will to do this because it has\r\nsuffered terrorist acts for over 40 years; because in\r\nCuba there are still the relatives of the nearly 3,500\r\nCubans killed as a result of acts of aggression and\r\nterrorism; and because justice is still demanded by the\r\nmore than 2,000 Cubans disabled by acts of aggression\r\nand terrorism. Some of Cuba’s sons and daughters who\r\nfought against terrorism have become the victims of\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\ncruel persecutions, merciless treatment and unjust and\r\nslanderous trials.\r\nThe people of the United States are victims not\r\nonly of terrorism and panic but also of the lack of\r\ntruthful information, manipulation and the questionable\r\ncurbing of their freedoms. Cuba does not nurture any\r\nhatred towards the American people, whom we do not\r\nhold responsible for our suffering caused by terrorism,\r\nacts of aggression and the unfair economic war that we\r\nhave had to withstand during almost an entire lifetime.\r\nWe share with the American people the aspiration of\r\none day having relations based on respect and\r\ncooperation.\r\nIf anyone here takes offence at these words\r\nuttered on behalf of a small, generous and courageous\r\npeople, I apologize. We speak in a straightforward\r\nmanner. Words exist to uphold the truth, not to conceal\r\nit. We rebel against injustice and oppression. We have\r\nthe moral resolution. We defend our ideals with our\r\nlives. Our support can be won for any just cause, but\r\nwe will not be overcome by force, or allow absurd\r\nslogans or shameful campaigns to be forced upon us.\r\nFor many years now, we have proclaimed that for\r\nus Cubans, the historical dilemma is: “Motherland or\r\nDeath!” From this comes our confidence and sureness\r\nthat we are and will continue to be a worthy, sovereign\r\nand just people.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I would like to urge once again that\r\nspeakers cooperate in limiting their statements to 15\r\nminutes each so that the projected schedules of the\r\nGeneral Assembly can proceed without much delay.\r\nI now give the floor to The Honourable\r\nLakshman Kadirgamar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSri Lanka.\r\nMr. Kadirgamar (Sri Lanka): Every speaker\r\nfrom this podium during the special debate on\r\nterrorism, the debate on dialogue among civilizations\r\nand our current general debate has said, suggested or\r\nimplied that 11 September has changed the world\r\nirrevocably. Indeed it has. A democracy is an open\r\nsociety. Movement is free. Speech is free. All the\r\ncitizens of a democratic society are free to lead their\r\nlives in freedom, subject only to the rule of law. Fear\r\nand the spirit of democratic freedom are two totally\r\nopposite states of mind. Yet, today, fear stalks the\r\nUnited States of America, where democracy has\r\nflourished vigorously for so long, bringing prosperity\r\nto its people and taking human achievement to\r\nunimagined heights of excellence.\r\nThere can be no argument that terror in all its\r\nmanifestations must be fought relentlessly and\r\nglobally. Gone are the days when a country affected by\r\nterror, as my country has been for two decades, can be\r\ntold by the international community, “We are sorry\r\nabout what is happening in your land, but there is\r\nnothing we can do to help you because we have no\r\nlaws to combat terror.” When our Central Bank was\r\nbombed and destroyed, when the Temple of the Sacred\r\nTooth Relic, one of the holiest shrines of Buddhism,\r\nwas bombed and saved from destruction only by a\r\nmiracle, when a commuter train carrying workers home\r\nwas attacked with explosives, when thousands of\r\npeople, including monks, women and children were\r\nslaughtered, when Muslims were massacred in a\r\nmosque while at prayer, when a President of Sri Lanka,\r\nMinisters and Members of Parliament and many other\r\nelected leaders were assassinated, let alone a Prime\r\nMinister of India, when a suicide bomber at an election\r\nrally attacked the incumbent President of Sri Lanka,\r\nkilling and wounding scores of innocent bystanders and\r\ngrievously wounding her in the right eye, the sight of\r\nwhich was lost — all this and much more has happened\r\nat the hands of a terrorist group in Sri Lanka — we\r\nreceived merely sympathies, condolences, expressions\r\nof shock and outrage, while the funding that fuels the\r\nterrorism in my country went on apace in the great,\r\nliberal democracies of the West. When half of the\r\naircraft in our national airline were damaged or\r\ndestroyed by those same terrorists on 24 July, we were\r\nadvised by some Governments to negotiate. We were\r\nreminded that “violence begets violence”.\r\nThat approach has changed dramatically in recent\r\ndays, or so it seems, because terrorism has assailed the\r\nnational interests of many countries. Terrorism is no\r\nlonger the curse of the poor. Now, more than ever\r\nbefore, when a terrorist attack takes place somewhere\r\nin the world, “never send to know for whom the bell\r\ntolls”, as John Donne said nearly four centuries ago,\r\nfor surely “it tolls for thee”.\r\nThe United Nations has focused sharply on\r\nbuilding consensus to fight terror. Two important\r\nUnited Nations conventions were adopted with\r\nadmirable speed — the International Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings and the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nFinancing of Terrorism. Another important convention\r\nis being considered at this session by the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on International Terrorism, which is chaired\r\nby Sri Lanka. Since we have been so severely affected\r\nby terrorism, it is only natural that we should play a\r\nleading role in designing the legislation that the\r\ninternational community should adopt and implement\r\nto combat terrorism.\r\nThere is a particularly abhorrent brand of\r\nterrorism that the world can never condone — that is,\r\nthe forcible conscription of young children for battle,\r\nwidely practiced by the terrorists of Sri Lanka and well\r\ndocumented by Amnesty International, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children\r\nand Armed Conflict. It would be a permanent blot on\r\nhumankind’s conscience if these poor children were to\r\nbe consigned, unnoticed and uncared for, to their\r\nmiserable fate.\r\nWhile terrorism must continue to be fought,\r\nrelentlessly and by everyone everywhere, sooner rather\r\nthan later the international community will have to\r\nfocus its collective attention on the question of\r\nanalysing and diagnosing the causes of terrorism,\r\npreventing and finally eliminating it before it becomes\r\na problem of such deadly dimensions that it threatens\r\nthe whole world. The causes of terrorism cannot be\r\nignored. To examine the roots of terrorism and the\r\nculture in which it breeds in a systematic, objective,\r\nwell-informed manner is not, by any means, to yield to\r\nterrorism. It is not a manifestation of weakness for the\r\ninternational community to examine the root causes of\r\nterrorism. It is axiomatic that a contented people do not\r\nrise up to destroy the society in which they live. If the\r\nworld has become a village, surely we must take care\r\nto ensure that the villagers living down one road in the\r\nvillage are not given cause to become resentful and\r\nangry at the opulence enjoyed by other villagers living\r\ndown another road, only a stone’s throw away.\r\nMight I suggest, therefore, that this General\r\nAssembly consider the convening of an international\r\ngroup of eminent persons with the appropriate\r\nbackgrounds in all relevant fields, representative of all\r\nregions of the world, appointed by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the President of the Security\r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General, with the request\r\nthat the group report to the General Assembly, the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General within an\r\nappropriate time frame on terrorism and its prevention.\r\nThus, inescapably we will have to revisit and re-\r\naddress the old questions that have haunted the United\r\nNations ever since it was born — that is, the questions\r\nof poverty, hunger, disease, ignorance and injustice.\r\nThese questions have been with us for a long time.\r\nThey have received answers which are, to a large\r\nextent, no more than faint-hearted attempts to forge\r\nsolutions that look grand on paper but are incapable of\r\nimplementation due to the lack of funds and the lack of\r\npolitical will.\r\nThe formulation of policy has always been far\r\neasier than its implementation and, when we look to\r\nthe future through the ultimate prism — namely, the\r\nfunding available — we face once more the bitter truth\r\nof which our colleagues from the developed world have\r\nbeen warning us year after year: “the funding globally\r\navailable is far from promising”.\r\nWe in the developing world have also been\r\nwarning our colleagues for so long, when a developing\r\ncountry is unable to generate a sufficient amount of\r\ndomestic capital, public or private, it is to international\r\ncapital that we, in the developing world, have to turn;\r\nand, as international private capital is sensitive to the\r\nrate and continuance of profitable return, it is only\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) that remains.\r\nOn 8 November, only a few days ago, at the\r\nEuropean Union’s (EU) Development Council in\r\nBrussels, a common statement was delivered by the\r\nfive Ministers for Development Cooperation of\r\nDenmark, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and\r\nSweden. Their words convey far more effectively, and\r\nwith far greater authority, than my words could\r\npossibly do, the thoughts of developing countries on\r\nthe question of development aid, and, therefore, I take\r\nthe liberty of quoting that common statement in its\r\nentirety:\r\n“In the Millennium Declaration, the\r\ninternational community recognized the fight\r\nagainst poverty as the greatest challenge to our\r\nglobal governance system”.\r\n“The events of 11 September have made it\r\neven more crucial to deal with these problems.\r\nWe not only need a global coalition against\r\nterrorism. We need a global coalition against\r\npoverty as well.\r\n“The Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, at the Conference on\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nthe Least Developed Countries in May 2001,\r\nremarked that only a few countries have lived up\r\nto the goals of devoting 0.7 percent of their gross\r\nnational product (GNP) to official development\r\nassistance (ODA), and that the least developed\r\ncountries suffer disproportionately as a result of\r\nthat.\r\n“We need better and more effective\r\ndevelopment assistance: policy coherence, lower\r\ntransaction costs by harmonization of procedures.\r\nWe need sharper focus on the importance of\r\nstrong institutions and sound economic and social\r\npolicy. But we cannot expect to reach our\r\ncommon goal of halving extreme poverty by 2015\r\nwithout increasing aid volume.”\r\nI continue to quote from the common statement:\r\n“There is no need for a new set of standards.\r\nAll United Nations members, with the exception\r\nof the United States, have accepted a long\r\nestablished standard volume of ODA for donor\r\ncountries: 0.7 percent of GNP. But the\r\ninternational community is still a long way from\r\nmaking this standard a reality.\r\n“Although the EU has stressed the\r\nimportance of the 0.7 percent target in the\r\nconclusions of the European Council in Göteborg,\r\nthe EU’s record is no exception: in 2000, member\r\nStates gave an average of only 0.33 per cent of\r\nGNP in ODA. This is better than the OECD\r\naverage of 0.24 per cent, but it is still a long way\r\nfrom the target.”\r\n“In fact, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark\r\nand Luxembourg are the only EU member States\r\nthat meet the ODA standard. Norway, a non-EU\r\nmember, is also part of this exclusive club.\r\nLuxembourg, the newest member of this group,\r\nhas proved that it is possible to raise ODA to 0.7\r\nper cent of GNP in a short period of time.\r\nTogether we make up the G-0.7.\r\n“The G-7 is full of promises. If all the rich\r\ncountries would just implement what they have\r\ncommitted themselves to, as the G-0.7 have done,\r\nwe would not encounter these financial\r\nconstraints. Having said that, we do realize that\r\nODA is not the only way forward. We also must\r\ntake into account fair distribution of resources,\r\ndebt relief, open markets, good governance and\r\nthe role of the private sector. A reform of the\r\nCommon Agricultural Policy is a great challenge\r\nto the EU.\r\n“We welcome new and innovative financing\r\noptions, but the main problem is that some\r\ncountries are not providing adequate ODA\r\nresources. Obviously there is a lack of political\r\ncommitment in setting budget priorities. These\r\ncountries need to change their political priorities\r\nin order to comply with their international\r\ncommitments.\r\n“EU Declarations like the one made in\r\nGöteborg do call for that much needed\r\ncompliance — that is to say, they call on us to\r\nkeep the promises we have already made — but\r\nthey do so only in general terms. We now need to\r\npick up the pace.\r\n“We call on EU members to make a firm\r\ncommitment at the International Conference on\r\nFinance for Development in Monterrey in 2002\r\nand to formulate individual plans and timetables\r\nin order to make concrete progress in reaching the\r\ngoal of 0.7 per cent of GNP to ODA.\r\n“Today’s EU Development Council in\r\nBrussels is a good opportunity to further\r\nstrengthen the relations in our global world. It\r\nshould send a long awaited signal that we are\r\nserious about our commitments to developing\r\ncountries.”\r\nI wish to place on record the high appreciation of\r\nmy Government to the Governments of Denmark,\r\nLuxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden for\r\nthose frank and refreshing observations.\r\nWe in the developing world will certainly look\r\nwith much expectation to the International Conference\r\non Financing for Development that will convene in\r\nMarch next year. We cannot but hope that,\r\nnotwithstanding the continuing difference in positions,\r\na secure foundation for a partnership for the future will\r\nbe formed there, within which both the strong interests\r\nof the developing world and the strong concerns of the\r\ndeveloped world can be adequately accommodated.\r\nAnd I would think that undoubtedly the\r\ndeveloped world too will, after the events of 11\r\nSeptember, look to the future with a frame of mind\r\ndifferent from its frame of mind before that fateful\r\ndate. Development, stability and contentment for all\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\npeople are no longer charitable objectives. They are in\r\nthe self-interest of all.\r\nMost certainly, neither we in the developing\r\nworld nor those in the developed world can allow\r\nabject, desperate poverty, without any hope of a better\r\nfuture, to become a fertile field for those who wish to\r\nfan the flames of discord and hate and make it their\r\nbusiness to wreak death, destruction, terror and\r\nmayhem.\r\nFifty-six years ago almost to this day, the\r\nConstitution of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization was proclaimed in\r\nwords that have a prophetic resonance today:\r\n“... since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in\r\nthe minds of men that the defences of peace must\r\nbe constructed;\r\n“... ignorance of each other’s ways and lives has\r\nbeen a common cause, throughout the history of\r\nmankind, of that suspicion and mistrust between\r\nthe peoples of the world through which their\r\ndifferences have all too often broken into war;\r\n“... the great and terrible war which has now\r\nended was a war made possible by the denial of\r\nthe democratic principles of the dignity, equality\r\nand mutual respect of men, and by the\r\npropagation, in their place, through ignorance and\r\nprejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men\r\nand races;\r\n“... a peace based exclusively upon the political\r\nand economic arrangements of governments\r\nwould not be a peace which could secure the\r\nunanimous, lasting and sincere support of the\r\npeoples of the world, and...the peace must\r\ntherefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the\r\nintellectual and moral solidarity of mankind.”\r\nThese are noble words of timeless quality. But\r\nwords, however noble, which remain untranslated into\r\ndeeds become shallow, tawdry, degraded.\r\nAll nations, all the peoples of the world, must\r\nrealize that we are slipping into a crisis of a kind we\r\nhave never encountered before. The spectres of fear,\r\ndoubt, uncertainty, mistrust and suspicion stalk the\r\nworld. The hour is late. The hour is grave.\r\nThe President: I call on Shaikh Mohammed Bin\r\nMubarak Al-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBahrain.\r\nShaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nThis session is taking place amid feelings of sadness\r\nand grief that prevail following the terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember that befell the United States. They\r\nvictimized the thousands, from more than 80 countries,\r\nwho were working in the World Trade Center in the\r\nCity of New York when the vicious attack took place,\r\nand also resulted in great material and economic\r\ndamage.\r\nMy country, the State of Bahrain, moved quickly\r\nto condemn the terrorist attacks in New York, just a\r\nfew kilometres from the Headquarters of the United\r\nNations, and in Washington, D.C. The Emir of Bahrain,\r\nShaikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa, expressed to\r\nMr. George W. Bush, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, and to the friendly people of the United\r\nStates of America the deep condolences of the Emir,\r\nthe Government and the people of the State of Bahrain\r\nfor the victims of these wicked attacks, which run\r\ncounter to the teachings of all divine religions as well\r\nas the basic tenets of humanity and the standards of\r\ncultural values.\r\nThe State of Bahrain has supported the\r\ninternational alliance against terrorism. It has offered\r\nits cooperation as a participant in efforts and measures\r\nto eliminate terrorism and terrorists as well as their\r\nhavens and financial resources. We have done so out of\r\nour firm and principled position against terrorism and\r\nour rejection of all forms of violence and extremism.\r\nSuch violence and extremism contradict the teachings\r\nof true Islam and its tolerant values, as well as all lofty\r\ncultural and human values in which we believe and\r\nwhich we support.\r\nThe State of Bahrain also followed and\r\nparticipated in the debates on combating terrorism\r\nduring this session of the General Assembly. It shares\r\nthe opinion of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nthat the shocking events of 11 September have united\r\nthe world against terrorism, as demonstrated by the\r\ncondemnation of those horrific attacks expressed by\r\nmillions of people from all societies. We also share the\r\nSecretary-General’s opinion that, because of its unique\r\nstructure, the United Nations has an important role to\r\nplay in mobilizing the international community in\r\ncountering and combating terrorism.\r\nAs part of its policy of cooperation with\r\ninternational efforts, the State of Bahrain welcomed\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), which dealt\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nwith the issue of terrorism, in particular operative\r\nparagraph 6, which requests Member States to report to\r\nthe Security Council Committee within 90 days on the\r\nsteps taken to implement the resolution.\r\nWhile expressing our feelings of sadness at the\r\nhorror of the events of 11 September, we must also\r\nwarn against the danger of exploiting the events to link\r\nterrorism to Islam. Islam is a religion of amity and\r\ntolerance, and we would like to warn against the\r\ndanger of stirring up hostility against Muslims and of\r\nigniting a conflict between religions and civilizations,\r\ninstead of dialogue and interaction among them for the\r\ngood of all societies and people of different races and\r\nbeliefs. In this context, we are pleased to welcome the\r\nposition taken by the United States of America and\r\nother friendly countries in calling on their citizens to\r\nrefrain from harming their residents or citizens of Arab\r\nand Muslim descent and reaffirming the spirit of\r\ntolerance, interaction and dialogue among religions and\r\ncultures.\r\nThe United Nations, which is the ideal tool for\r\nconfronting international terrorism, faces other\r\nchallenges that stand in the way of cooperation for\r\nprosperity, economic and social development and the\r\nbuilding of a world in which justice, peace and equality\r\nprevail.\r\nIn this regard, this year the United Nations held\r\nseveral special sessions of the General Assembly, one\r\non human settlements and the other on HIV/AIDS, as\r\nwell as a Conference on small arms. The Economic and\r\nSocial Council also convened conferences on\r\ninformation technology, the eradication of poverty and\r\nfinancing for development, as well as the World\r\nConference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, which was hosted\r\nby the Republic of South Africa.\r\nThe State of Bahrain endorsed the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration, and today — on the basis of\r\nits deep-rooted civilization and sustained revival aimed\r\nat strengthening the foundations of the modern State,\r\nattaining comprehensive development, further\r\ninvigorating the mechanisms of civil society and public\r\ninstitutions in order to enable its citizens to understand\r\ncurrent issues and the need for further advancement —\r\nit reaffirms its determination to continue shouldering\r\nits national, regional and international responsibilities,\r\nwith a view to achieving the common purposes and\r\nprinciples set out in the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand the Millennium Declaration.\r\nIn this context, His Highness Shaikh Hamad Bin\r\nIsa Al-Khalifa, Emir of the State of Bahrain, took the\r\ninitiative to establish a national committee that\r\nincludes representatives from all sectors of Bahraini\r\nsociety. This committee prepared a draft Charter for\r\nnational action, which was approved in a free\r\nreferendum by a majority of 98.4 per cent of the people\r\nof Bahrain, and was ratified by His Highness the Emir\r\nin February this year. This Charter is part of a\r\ncomprehensive plan to develop Bahraini society,\r\nupdate its systems and institutions and transform it into\r\na modern State capable of participating effectively in\r\nthe new world order and of facing the challenges and\r\nrequirements of the era.\r\nThis historic step was coupled with a number of\r\nmeasures to improve and update constitutional and\r\ndemocratic institutions, reaffirm the rule of law,\r\nachieve justice, equality and equal opportunities and\r\nenhance popular participation. Foremost among these\r\nare developments in the field of human rights, which\r\nhave confirmed the participation of women and\r\nenhanced their role in civil society, including their\r\nright to vote and to run for elected office, as well as the\r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Committee of the\r\nShura Council and the establishment of the Supreme\r\nCouncil for Women. The Council’s mandate includes,\r\ninter alia, proposing public policies in the field of\r\ndevelopment and enhancing the role of women in civic\r\nand constitutional State institutions. Proud of its\r\naccomplishments in the political, economic and social\r\nfields and reiterating its determination to press ahead\r\nwith its comprehensive development plans to build a\r\nmodern State capable of reaffirming its international\r\nposition and consolidating its relations with various\r\ncountries of the world, the State of Bahrain would also\r\nlike to express its thanks and appreciation for the\r\nsupport given by many States of our Organization to\r\nthe worthy steps taken by His Highness the Emir.\r\nBahrain’s determination to imbue its relations\r\nwith others with a spirit of friendship and cooperation\r\nis evidenced by its fraternal, amicable and close\r\nrelations with brotherly and friendly States. Such\r\nrelations are based on mutual respect, non-interference\r\nin the internal affairs of others and the promotion of\r\ngood-neighbourly relations and cooperation among\r\nStates. In this respect, it is worth noting the position of\r\nboth the State of Bahrain and the State of Qatar on the\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\njudgement handed down by the International Court of\r\nJustice on 16 March this year, which brought to an end\r\nthe border dispute between the two brotherly countries.\r\nThe statements issued by the leaders of both countries\r\nsaid that the judgement, which was accepted by the two\r\ncountries, had opened a new page in relations between\r\nthem, based as they are on agreement and cooperation\r\naimed at achieving their common interests, and that it\r\nrepresented the triumph of international legitimacy and\r\nthe principles of international law.\r\nIt is regrettable that the ramifications of the\r\ndangerous events witnessed in the Gulf region over the\r\npast 20 years constitute an ongoing threat to the\r\nsecurity and stability of the region and an obstacle to\r\nits development and growth. The State of Bahrain,\r\nwhich would like to see regional and international\r\nsecurity prevail, especially in the Gulf region, which\r\nhas strategic importance and in which various countries\r\nof the world have vital interests, calls once again upon\r\nIraq to cooperate with the United Nations and to fully\r\nimplement the relevant Security Council resolutions, in\r\nparticular those relating to weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and to the release of Kuwaiti prisoners of\r\nwar and detainees and those of other nationalities, so\r\nthat efforts to lift the sanctions and to end the suffering\r\nof its brotherly people may succeed.\r\nThe State of Bahrain also hopes that, in the light\r\nof the positive developments in relations between the\r\ncountries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, a peaceful solution can be\r\nreached in the current dispute between the latter and\r\nthe United Arab Emirates over the three islands,\r\nGreater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, all of which\r\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates. The State of\r\nBahrain approves of and welcomes the direct contacts\r\nthat have taken place between the two neighbouring\r\ncountries and hopes that the dispute will be settled by\r\npeaceful means in accordance with the principles of\r\ninternational law, including referral to the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nSince the current Israeli Government came to\r\npower, the Middle East has experienced serious\r\ndevelopments that have brought back conditions of\r\nhostility and confrontation such as engulfed the region\r\nprior to the beginning of the Madrid peace process in\r\n1991. This has come about through Israel’s aggression\r\nagainst the Palestinian people and its oppression,\r\neconomic isolation and blockades of all the territory\r\nunder Palestinian authority.\r\nThe peace process based on Security Council\r\nresolutions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973), and on the Madrid terms of reference —\r\nspecifically the principle of land for peace — is at an\r\nimpasse. The explosive situation in the Palestinian\r\nAuthority’s territories, with all its inherent risks,\r\nincluding the threat to security and stability in the\r\nMiddle East and to the interests of the Authority and\r\nother States, requires the international community, and\r\nprimarily the sponsors of the peace process, to shoulder\r\ntheir responsibilities to put the peace process back on\r\ntrack so that its objectives may be achieved.\r\nThis can be done only through the full\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions calling\r\nfor a complete withdrawal from the Arab territories\r\noccupied by Israel in the Syrian Golan Heights up to\r\nthe boundaries of 4 June 1967 and from the remaining\r\noccupied territories of the Republic of Lebanon, and\r\nthrough full recognition of the legitimate rights of the\r\nPalestinian people, including its rights of return and to\r\nthe establishment of its own independent State with\r\nJerusalem as its capital. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nstatement made by President Bush of the United States\r\nof America on the right of the Palestinian people —\r\nsupported by the European Union, the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council and the international\r\ncommunity — to establish a Palestinian State.\r\nThe role of the United Nations and the reform of\r\nits machinery to enable it to face its challenges and\r\novercome them collectively are among the priorities of\r\nthe Charter that were reinforced by the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The Declaration calls on us to uphold the\r\nrule of law nationally and internationally, to respect\r\nhuman rights and to conduct international relations in\r\nsuch a way as to preserve world security, peace,\r\ndevelopment and stability.\r\nIn praising the role of the United Nations, I\r\nshould also like to take this opportunity to convey my\r\nwarm and sincere congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nwhom the Member States have unanimously re-elected\r\nas Secretary-General for a second term in office in\r\nrecognition of his tireless efforts to allow the\r\nOrganization to play its full role and to achieve its\r\nobjectives. Through those efforts, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations under his leadership\r\nhave fully deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for this year\r\nin appreciation of their great contribution to\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. I\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General and the United\r\nNations on that honour.\r\nI also have the pleasure to extend to you, Sir, and\r\nto your friendly country, the Republic of Korea, our\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I express\r\nthe hope that you will succeed in carrying out your\r\ntasks. I also thank your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri\r\nof Finland, President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-fifth session, and commend his invaluable efforts\r\nin conducting the proceedings of that session and of the\r\nspecial sessions held in conjunction with it.\r\nWe believe firmly that the destiny of the human\r\nrace is a common destiny, given that we all live in one\r\nworld. We are therefore duty-bound to preserve that\r\nworld and to protect it from the threats of war,\r\ninternational terrorism, conflict, disease and poverty. It\r\nis incumbent on us, the peoples of the United Nations,\r\nas stated in the Charter, to choose to practice tolerance\r\nand to live according to the will of Almighty God as\r\npeoples that cooperate in the pursuit of friendship,\r\njustice, peace and security.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Roberto Rojas López, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Rojas López (Costa Rica) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me at the outset to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your well-deserved election to preside over the\r\nwork of this General Assembly. We are familiar with\r\nyour valuable personal qualities and appreciate the\r\nleadership of your country, the Republic of Korea, in\r\nthe concert of nations. I would also like to express my\r\ngratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri,\r\nfor his excellent work.\r\nI should like to express the deepest condolences\r\nof the people and Government of Costa Rica to the\r\nGovernment of the Dominican Republic and to the\r\nrelatives and friends of the more than 200 Dominican\r\nnationals who lost their lives in the tragic aeroplane\r\naccident that occurred here yesterday.\r\nThis year, the General Assembly is meeting in\r\nextraordinary circumstances. Only two moths ago, this\r\ncity fell victim to the most dreadful and despicable\r\nterrorist attack in world history. Even today, just a few\r\nkilometres from this Hall, we can contemplate,\r\nbewildered, the column of smoke that marks the\r\nremains of the twin towers. The rubble reminds us of\r\nthe destruction, pain and death caused by violence and\r\nirrational hatred. Therefore, I cannot let pass this\r\nopportunity without reiterating the deepest condolences\r\nof the people and Government of Costa Rica to the\r\npeople and Government of the United States.\r\nOn 11 September, the terrorists targeted not only\r\nNew York, but the whole of humankind. Today, we all\r\nare victims of terrorism. Costa Rica realizes that\r\nterrorism is an extremely grave crime against humanity\r\nthat victimizes the innocent civil population and\r\nendangers the international community as a whole. For\r\nthis reason, we condemn terrorism categorically in all\r\nits forms and manifestations, wherever and by\r\nwhomever committed, while we proclaim that there is\r\nno political, philosophical, racial, ethnic or religious\r\njustification that legitimizes the commission of this\r\ncrime.\r\nThe recent terrorist attacks force us to rethink the\r\nconcept of international security and to renew our\r\ncommitment to mankind’s basic values. When faced\r\nwith cruel fear and hatred, we must raise the flag of\r\ncivilization, tolerance and brotherhood. In the face of\r\nirrational violence, we must take up the arms of reason,\r\nlaw and order. Against terrorism, we must resort to the\r\nrule of law, justice and due process through\r\ninternational cooperation in the judicial and law\r\nenforcement fields.\r\nFaced with new treats to international security,\r\nthe community of nations must create effective and\r\nprecise mechanisms to ensure peace and development\r\nfor all peoples. In this context, we welcome the\r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). It\r\nconstitutes a firm, proportionate and necessary answer\r\nto the despicable acts of 11 September.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the progress achieved\r\nin the negotiation of a comprehensive convention to\r\nproscribe and punish terrorism in all its forms. My\r\ndelegation has taken active part in the recent\r\nnegotiations to solve the outstanding issues, and we are\r\ngrateful to the Secretary-General for his personal\r\ninvolvement in obtaining a consensus solution. We call\r\nupon all delegations to be flexible and to agree to the\r\nconsensus formula proposed by the coordinator of the\r\ncontact group on this issue.\r\nThe struggle against terrorism must lead us to\r\nbuild a true culture of peace and life. Right now, we\r\nhave the duty to plant the seeds of peace in order to\r\nsubstitute the vices of destruction and conflict with the\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nvirtues of fraternity, tolerance and cooperation among\r\nall men and women.\r\nCurrently, thanks to scientific and technological\r\nprogress, we can defeat disease, poverty, famine, hatred\r\nand war. We now posses the necessary economic,\r\ntechnological and philosophical means to guarantee to\r\neach and every person the highest standards of life and\r\nthe necessary conditions for their fullest physical,\r\nintellectual and spiritual development.\r\nIn this context, the United Nations could and\r\nshould play a central role in building a future of peace\r\nand freedom. This Organization must be a bastion\r\nagainst war, hatred and poverty. This institution must\r\nbe a beacon that lights the way and points towards the\r\nfinal goal.\r\nTo this end, the respect of human rights and\r\npromotion of human dignity, in all spheres, must be the\r\ncrux of the activities of the United Nations. The\r\nprotection of human beings is the only justification for\r\npeacekeeping activities. The promotion of human\r\ndignity is the only legitimate reason for pursuing\r\nsustainable development. The protection of human life\r\nis the only justification for the protection of the\r\nenvironment or search for economic development. The\r\nphilosophy of this Organization must therefore be\r\ndeeply humane.\r\nThe protection of human rights is the cornerstone\r\nof Costa Rica’s foreign policy. Costa Ricans loathe\r\nevery violation of fundamental rights. We reject\r\nintolerance, hatred, inequality and war. We condemn\r\nextrajudicial executions, the death penalty, abortion,\r\nforced displacement, torture, rape and hostage-taking.\r\nWe categorically condemn all restrictions on freedom\r\nof speech and thought. The ethical values of the Costa\r\nRican identity make us proclaim a more just and\r\nhumane society and demand greater solidarity.\r\nThis Organization’s work in the area of human\r\nrights is outstanding. The codification efforts and the\r\nperiodic conferences have provided the international\r\ncommunity with clear guidelines of conduct. Now, we\r\nmust concentrate our efforts in the implementation of\r\nthose norms at all levels of society, placing special\r\nemphasis on the fulfilment of economic, social and\r\ncultural rights.\r\nIn particular, it is necessary to rationalize and\r\ncoordinate the work of the monitoring organs,\r\nincluding the Commission on Human Rights, in order\r\nto make them more effective. Costa Rica considers it\r\nnecessary to review the national reports system in order\r\nto make it more transparent and expeditious. We\r\nbelieve that Member States must open their borders in\r\na candid and forthright manner to the human rights\r\nrapporteurs that are appointed by the Commission. This\r\nobligation flows directly from the commitments\r\nundertaken under Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter.\r\nSimultaneously, we must respond positively to the\r\nrequest for additional resources made by the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Moreover, the\r\nUnited Nations must remain vigilant so as to deal with\r\nthe new challenges that threaten the enjoyment of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe are concerned by the recent developments in\r\nthe area of cloning and biotechnology. For this reason,\r\nwe welcome the proposal by France and Germany to\r\nnegotiate an international agreement to prohibit the\r\nreproductive cloning of human beings. We believe that\r\nsuch an instrument should also forbid other forms of\r\nexperimentation in biotechnology that are contrary to\r\nboth human life and dignity.\r\nWe must strengthen the family as the basic\r\nbuilding block of society. The family is indispensable\r\nfor the formation of healthy, productive and\r\nresponsible citizens. We must also make additional\r\nefforts to support parents in the education of their\r\nchildren. In this regard, my country recently enacted a\r\nspecial law on responsible parenthood that ensures,\r\nthrough unprecedented and resolute judicial means,\r\nthat all biological fathers will be responsible for the\r\neducation and care of any offspring born out of\r\nwedlock.\r\nThe efforts to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity must also be seen from the point of view of\r\nhuman rights. Armed conflicts produce continuous\r\nhumanitarian crises and atrocities. As long as war\r\nexists, it will be impossible to ensure respect for the\r\nbasic human rights. In situations of armed conflict, all\r\nnecessary measures must be taken to protect the\r\nsecurity of innocent civilians. It is crucial to provide\r\nthem with immediate assistance, in order to prevent\r\ngreater loss of life and destruction. It is also necessary\r\nto protect the human rights of refugees and displaced\r\npersons. Furthermore, at the end of an armed conflict,\r\ngreater international cooperation is required to rebuild\r\nthe national economy and lost infrastructure and to\r\nreturn life to normal.\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nFor several years, my delegation has advocated\r\nthe strengthening of the Security Council. We have said\r\nthat it is the only mechanism that humanity has to\r\nconfront the threats that beset it. Costa Rica has\r\nquestioned the Council when it has ignored its duties\r\nand has been reduced to irrelevance. We have criticized\r\nit when it has confined itself to giving weak and\r\ninadequate answers to the gravest political and\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. We have denounced it when\r\nit has been unable to act because of an irresponsible\r\nuse of the veto or the defence of national interests of\r\ncertain of its members. Today, the adoption of\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) gives us new hope. We are\r\nconfident that, in the future, the Security Council will\r\nconfront other emergency situations with the same\r\ndecisiveness, promptness and effectiveness.\r\nWeapons are a catalyst for armed conflicts. Their\r\nproliferation fans the flames of violence; exacerbates\r\nfighting and hatred; aggravates crime and terrorism;\r\nand fosters political and social instability. Military\r\narsenals prolong armed conflicts and impede peace\r\nprocesses, while the armies consume insatiably the\r\nmeagre national resources. To attain peace, it is\r\nnecessary to forbid the transfer of arms to rebel,\r\nextremist or terrorist groups. The transfer of weapons\r\nto Governments that commit systematic human rights\r\nviolations, do not respect democratic principles or have\r\nnot ratified the main instruments of international\r\nhumanitarian law should also be forbidden. We believe\r\nthat it is essential to regulate the possession of light\r\nweapons by civilians.\r\nMy country condemns the unilateral and\r\ndisproportionate use of force and countermeasures,\r\nwhile it supports the mechanisms and principles\r\nenshrined in international law. We must embrace\r\nnegotiation, dialogue, mediation and the judicial\r\nresolution of disputes. For this reason, Costa Rica fully\r\nendorses and has full confidence in the excellent work\r\nof the International Court of Justice. We believe that\r\nthe voluntary acceptance of its obligatory jurisdiction,\r\nthrough optional declarations, is clear proof of good\r\nfaith. However, we cannot fail to express our deep\r\nconcern about the existence and emergence of new\r\nreservations on the voluntary acceptance of the Court’s\r\njurisdiction. Good faith in international relations\r\ndemands the withdrawal of those reservations.\r\nTrue and sustainable peace can be achieved only\r\nwhen decent living conditions are guaranteed to all\r\npeople; when there is a level of economic development\r\nsufficiently advanced so that everyone can satisfy his\r\nor her basic needs; when basic human rights are\r\nrespected; and when social and political differences are\r\nresolved through democratic means, dialogue and\r\nnegotiation. Therefore, it is essential to invest\r\nintensively and systematically in our human resources,\r\ndevoting all necessary resources to education and\r\nhealth. Only an educated population can live in\r\nfreedom, only a healthy population can work for\r\ndevelopment and only a cultured population can\r\nintegrate itself in the globalized contemporary world.\r\nSimilarly, it is necessary to ensure the sustainable\r\nuse and management of natural resources. Without a\r\nhealthy environment it is impossible to attain decent\r\nliving conditions, both for the present and for the\r\nfuture. We cannot ignore the damage caused to future\r\ngenerations by the destruction of thousands of square\r\nkilometres of the earth’s forests.\r\nCosta Rica has developed a national system of\r\npayments for environmental services with a view to\r\nalleviating the impact of greenhouse gases and\r\npreserving our forests for mankind. My country has\r\ndevoted one quarter of its national territory to the\r\nprotection of its forests. The production of\r\nenvironmental goods and the provision of\r\nenvironmental services have become an engine of\r\nnational development. For these reasons, my country\r\nwill be honoured to be the host country of the first\r\nministerial meeting of the United Nations Forum on\r\nForests, which will be held in March 2002. We look\r\nforward to the active and constructive participation of\r\nall Member States in that meeting.\r\nMy delegation notes with concern the growing\r\ninequality in the area of vulnerability. The States with\r\nthe most fragile economies and whose inhabitants have\r\nfewer resources for prevention and reconstruction are\r\nthe ones that suffer most from the effects of natural\r\ndisasters. In our region, Central America, we have been\r\nthe victims of several disasters that, in the course of the\r\npast decade, have caused very serious human and\r\nmaterial losses. The lack of financial resources imposes\r\na harsh limit on the poorest nations’ capacity to prevent\r\nhumanitarian emergencies. Therefore, we advocate an\r\nincrease in international cooperation with developing\r\nnations to enable them to design and implement\r\nprogrammes to reduce their vulnerability.\r\nIn this context, I would like to mention the\r\nbilateral assistance that the Republic of China in\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nTaiwan has given our region to face these emergencies.\r\nCosta Rica understands and supports the repeated\r\nefforts of the Republic of China in Taiwan, with 23\r\nmillion inhabitants and a firm process of democratic\r\ndevelopment and strengthening, to obtain\r\nrepresentation within this Organization. That country\r\nalso constitutes one of the main industrial centres of\r\nthe Asian basin, with which most Member States have\r\nstrong commercial and technical exchange ties. We\r\nhope that all differences will soon be put aside so that\r\nit will be possible to achieve agreements and both\r\nbranches of the Chinese people will be able to\r\nparticipate jointly in international forums.\r\nJust a couple of months ago we witnessed the\r\nbloody and abominable impact of international\r\nterrorism. Those despicable acts shook the conscience\r\nof humanity as a whole. In these circumstances, the\r\nworld awaits the guidance of the United Nations. Our\r\npeoples demand the decisive and firm action of the\r\ninternational community. Humanity as a whole calls on\r\nus to fulfil the lofty goals that we undertook when we\r\nestablished this Organization.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Ms. Anna Lindh, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Sweden.\r\nMs. Lindh (Sweden): Let me start by\r\ncongratulating the United Nations and its Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on being awarded the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize. This is an extremely well-deserved award\r\nto a unique Organization and a unique Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to express my\r\nsincere condolences to the families of the victims of\r\nyesterday’s tragedy near John F. Kennedy Airport.\r\nWe are all going through days of sorrow and\r\nanger: sorrow for human suffering, for the loss of\r\nhuman lives and for loss of security; anger, because\r\nterrorists hit innocent people and because terror is\r\ntargeted at openness and democracy and threatens our\r\ncommon security and welfare.\r\nSeldom has the international community been\r\nchallenged as it was through the terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember. The United Nations rose to the challenge\r\nand took the lead in the struggle against international\r\nterrorism. Seldom have we — the peoples of the United\r\nNations — shown such a strong common reaction and\r\nunity. Sweden stands wholeheartedly by the United\r\nNations in its call to fight terrorism, and we express\r\nour solidarity with the American people and\r\nGovernment at this difficult time.\r\nWe have now three immediate tasks. First, all\r\nnations have to take action against terrorism, as stated\r\nin Security Council resolution 1373 (2001): action\r\nagainst the financing, planning and execution of\r\nterrorist acts; and action that makes it clear to those\r\nresponsible for terror that they will be punished for\r\ntheir acts.\r\nWe support the right of the United States\r\nGovernment to self-defence, in accordance with\r\ninternational law. We emphasize the central role of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nSecondly, we must assist the people of\r\nAfghanistan in their immediate needs. The Afghan\r\npeople have suffered war, natural disasters and\r\noppression for decades. They are held hostage by an\r\nillegitimate regime. Women and children are\r\nsystematically abused. Women are denied health care\r\nand work; girls are practically denied education; and\r\ntheir freedom is heavily restricted. Human rights do not\r\nexist under Taliban rule. It is crucial that in all cities\r\nnow liberated from the Taliban human rights and law\r\nand order be guaranteed.\r\nThe humanitarian situation facing the people of\r\nAfghanistan is acute. The United Nations and all its\r\nMember States must increase their efforts to meet the\r\nneeds of the Afghan population. Closed borders must\r\nbe opened immediately, both for refugees who seek\r\nasylum and for the secure transport of emergency\r\nsupplies.\r\nThirdly, we must assist the people of Afghanistan\r\nin the reconstruction of their country. The restoration\r\nof this ravaged nation to a state of peaceful coexistence\r\nmust involve a political process leading to a\r\nrepresentative government that respects human rights\r\nand fosters democratic development. The role,\r\nprotection and participation of women must be high on\r\nevery policy agenda.\r\nWhile addressing these immediate tasks, we must\r\nnot lose sight of our long-term agenda.\r\nA year ago, here in New York, heads of State and\r\nGovernment from 147 countries adopted the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Their message was clear: only\r\nby working together can we meet the challenges of\r\nglobalization.\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nToday we need to build coalitions and to join\r\nforces, not only against international terrorism, but also\r\nto fight other global problems. We need to join forces\r\nin the fight for global justice. Globalization and\r\nopenness make people aware of what they have, and of\r\nwhat they lack. People wish to participate. People wish\r\nto share the benefits of development. This is positive\r\nand represents a challenge to the international\r\ncommunity’s ability to narrow the gap between rich\r\nand poor.\r\nGlobalization creates wealth, but that wealth must\r\nbe more equally distributed. Today, more than one\r\nbillion people live in absolute poverty. The Millennium\r\nSummit pledged to halve poverty by the year 2015.\r\nThis is a welcome commitment, but it is still not\r\nenough. Political efforts should be combined with\r\neconomic, technical and scientific progress.\r\nDevelopment cooperation, trade and agricultural\r\npolicies must aim at poverty eradication. The\r\ninstruments are there, and the possibilities today are\r\nbetter than ever before, but we, the Governments, need\r\nto show courage and political will. We must provide\r\nhope of freedom for the oppressed, education for the\r\nilliterate, food for the hungry, health care for the sick\r\nand equality for women.\r\nIncreased official development assistance is\r\ntherefore crucial. Sweden is one of the few countries\r\nmeeting the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national income in development aid. I urge all\r\ndeveloped countries, in particular the big economic\r\nPowers, to make real progress towards achieving this\r\ngoal.\r\nThe poorer countries must be integrated into the\r\nworld economy, and the new United Nations road map\r\nis a concrete and welcome step in this direction. The\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Mexico, and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\r\nJohannesburg — in which the Swedish Prime Minister,\r\nMr. Göran Persson, will participate — could be the\r\nstarting points for new partnership arrangements\r\nbetween Government institutions, civil society and the\r\nprivate sector — a partnership for global justice.\r\nHIV/AIDS is one of the greatest threats to\r\nhumanity in our time. In some countries, large parts of\r\nentire generations fall victim to the disease. Millions of\r\nchildren are orphaned. Economic progress is hampered,\r\nand development opportunities are lost. All Member\r\nStates must show strong political and financial\r\ncommitment and solidarity. Sweden welcomes the new\r\nglobal fund to fight HIV/AIDS and will contribute $60\r\nmillion over the next three years to the fund.\r\nA new round of broad negotiations in the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) can make an important\r\ncontribution to worldwide growth and development.\r\nBut the interests and concerns of the developing\r\ncountries must be properly addressed. Every effort\r\nmust be made to liberalize trade. The example set by\r\nthe European Union — to open its market to\r\n“everything but arms” — should be followed by others.\r\nDeveloping countries should receive support in\r\nbuilding their capacity to fully integrate into the world\r\ntrading system and the global economy.\r\nThe global responsibility in terms of providing\r\nmore resources and greater market access to\r\ndeveloping countries is clear. But the main\r\nresponsibility for development rests with the\r\nGovernments and peoples in developing countries.\r\nGood governance and sound national policies are\r\nprerequisites for sustained development and poverty\r\nreduction.\r\nWe need to join forces in the struggle for human\r\nrights and democracy. When rights are respected, when\r\nvoices are heard, when society is tolerant, society also\r\nbecomes safer for all.\r\nViolations of human rights threaten the security\r\nand well-being not only of the individual but also of\r\nsociety, and they cause tensions and conflicts.\r\nSustainable development and political stability can be\r\nbuilt only on respect for universal and indivisible\r\nhuman rights and on democratic development.\r\nDiscrimination in any form is unacceptable and\r\nincompatible with these fundamental principles. It is\r\nthe responsibility of every Government to safeguard\r\nequal rights and opportunities for men and women, as\r\nwell as the rights of the child.\r\nThose guilty of human rights violations and\r\ncrimes against humanity should never find refuge\r\nbehind national borders. The transfer of Mr. Milosevic\r\nto the International Tribunal demonstrates the resolve\r\nof the international community to act against impunity.\r\nIt carries great symbolic value and will contribute to\r\nthe process of reconciliation.\r\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt will strengthen our ability to try suspected\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nviolators of international and humanitarian law. It is a\r\nmatter of the highest priority to have the Court\r\noperational promptly, and I urge those States which\r\nhave not yet done so to ratify the Rome Statute.\r\nSweden also welcomes the initiative by the\r\nSecretary-General to involve global business in\r\npromoting human rights through the Global Compact.\r\nWe need to join forces to prevent violent\r\nconflicts. We need to work against hatred and suspicion\r\nbetween peoples and to stimulate a dialogue between\r\nand within cultures. Preventing violent conflict is a\r\nprimary obligation of Member States under the United\r\nNations Charter, but it took us half a century to start\r\nworking towards this goal systematically. We now have\r\na better understanding of the complex root causes of\r\nconflicts. The responsibility of preventing conflict\r\nultimately rests on every Government. Successful long-\r\nterm prevention cannot be imposed from the outside,\r\nbut the local parties should be encouraged and assisted\r\nin containing an emerging conflict.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on conflict\r\nprevention is a very valuable contribution to the\r\ndevelopment of a global strategy. I urge all Member\r\nStates to take an active part in its follow-up.\r\nA core task of the United Nations is to effectively\r\nmanage conflicts where prevention fails. It is the\r\nUnited Nations that provides the legal foundation for\r\nglobal action. Sweden therefore strongly supports the\r\nprocess that the Brahimi report has set in motion. But\r\nwe, the Member States, have yet to provide the United\r\nNations with the necessary resources to strengthen its\r\ncapacities in the area of peace operations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s efforts to strengthen the\r\nties between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in the areas of conflict prevention and\r\npeace-building are most welcome.\r\nCooperation with the United Nations is essential\r\nin developing the European Union’s conflict-\r\nprevention and crisis-management capabilities. In\r\nGöteborg last June the Union adopted a framework for\r\nincreased interaction, so that European Union\r\ncapacities can provide real added value for the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe need to join forces for peace in the Middle\r\nEast. Our aim must be two States, Israel and Palestine,\r\nwith secure and recognized borders. The basis is\r\ninternational law and the Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe situation has deteriorated in the past year, despite\r\nstrong efforts by the United Nations, the United States,\r\nthe European Union, Russia and others. A further\r\nescalation must be avoided. Israel must withdraw from\r\nthe occupied territories, cease the settlements policy\r\nand put an end to the extrajudicial executions. The\r\nPalestinians must do everything in their power to stop\r\nthe attacks against innocent civilians. Sweden strongly\r\nsupports the recommendations of the Mitchell report,\r\nincluding a monitoring mechanism, for an end to\r\nviolence and a revival of the peace process.\r\nWe must join forces for multilateral disarmament.\r\nA world free from weapons of mass destruction would\r\nbe a much safer world. Multilateral agreements\r\ncontribute to security for the individual. They have\r\nproduced impressive results — chemical and biological\r\nweapons have been totally banned. Still, however,\r\nmany challenges remain.\r\nThree years ago, Sweden helped launch the New\r\nAgenda Coalition — a group of States concerned with\r\nthe lack of progress in nuclear disarmament and\r\nsharing a vision of a nuclear-weapon-free world. In our\r\ncase, the initiative was rooted in the firm belief that\r\nboth global and national security depend on\r\nmultilateral frameworks and platforms.\r\nLast year, the 187 States parties to the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) adopted by consensus a\r\nroad map towards nuclear disarmament. Based on the\r\nundertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to fully\r\neliminate their nuclear arsenals, a 12-step action plan\r\nwas agreed on. This promising outcome was also\r\nconfirmed by the General Assembly. All States parties\r\nhave pledged to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world\r\nunder strict and effective international control. I\r\nstrongly urge the four States remaining outside the\r\nTreaty to sign and ratify it.\r\nWe have a number of important instruments to\r\nprevent testing, to ban production of weapons material\r\nand to improve verification. The Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty and the Additional Protocol to the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement pave the\r\nway for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nNow it is now time to concentrate on their\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe United States plans for a strategic missile\r\ndefence system risk having a negative impact on\r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the whole NPT\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nprocess. The ongoing consultations are welcome, but\r\nthe outcome is still uncertain. We strongly believe that\r\nthe new threats of proliferation require a multilateral\r\nresponse built on the already existing safety net.\r\nDeep cuts in strategic and tactical nuclear\r\narsenals are long overdue and should be accompanied\r\nby effective mechanisms of verification and\r\nirreversibility. Such treaty agreements can never be\r\nreplaced by unilateral declarations.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction remain a threat to\r\nmankind. Terrorists must not be given the opportunity\r\nto threaten us with these weapons. Now is the time to\r\nreinforce efforts to contain proliferation.\r\nThe United Nations remains a unique global\r\nforum. It is the one organization we can all equally\r\ncount on and turn to for security and development — as\r\nthe safeguard of our common future. The United\r\nNations needs to be strengthened, and it needs reform.\r\nWe need the United Nations, and the United Nations\r\nneeds us.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nGoran Svilanović, the Federal Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Yugoslavia.\r\nMr. Svilanović (Yugoslavia): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly. Your sterling\r\ncredentials, Sir, and vast experience are a firm\r\nguarantee that our proceedings will run smoothly and\r\nbear fruit.\r\nI would also like to congratulate the United\r\nNations and the Secretary-General on the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize. The award is the acknowledgement of the\r\nimportant role our Organization has in protecting world\r\npeace and promoting social progress and human rights,\r\nas well as an acknowledgement of the successful\r\nleadership of the Secretary-General. This honour\r\nshould be strong encouragement for all of us to put\r\neven more effort into achieving the purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet me also express our deepest sympathies to the\r\nfamilies of the victims of yesterday’s tragic plane\r\ncrash.\r\nThe terrorist attacks in New York and Washington\r\non 11 September have affected not only the United\r\nStates but all of us. Once again, we were painfully\r\nreminded that only together, with joint efforts, can we\r\nstand up to global challenges such as terrorism.\r\nTerrorism is a universal evil, a crime against\r\nhumanity itself. It equally affects people of every\r\nreligion, nationality and walk of life. Therefore we did\r\nnot hesitate to support fully all international actions\r\nagainst terrorism. In that context, it is particularly\r\nimportant to ensure the full implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and all international\r\nconventions against terrorism. On behalf of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, I have just signed the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism. Yugoslavia has also taken a\r\nseries of domestic measures to combat terrorism and\r\nhas coordinated its actions with other States.\r\nHaving been confronted with terrorism for quite\r\nsome time itself, Yugoslavia is well aware of how\r\ndifficult it is to fight this evil. It is not enough to\r\nprevent terrorist attacks and to capture and punish the\r\nperpetrators. It is even more important to deal with the\r\nsocial causes of terrorism, in particular, to address\r\nissues of poverty and the lack of opportunity. It is also\r\nvital to strengthen democracy and respect for human\r\nrights everywhere in the world. Poverty breeds anger,\r\nand if not channelled into democratic political\r\nprocesses, anger can easily fuel extremism.\r\nIn this regard, the experience of Yugoslavia in\r\ndealing with terrorism in southern Serbia has shown\r\nthat it is not sufficient to combat terrorism solely with\r\nsecurity forces. We have therefore developed a\r\ncomprehensive plan which, in addition to security\r\nmeasures, also aims at improving the economic\r\nsituation in southern Serbia and reintegrating ethnic\r\nAlbanians into the political process and State\r\nstructures, especially at the local level. We are\r\nimplementing this plan in cooperation with a number of\r\ninternational organizations, and this joint effort has\r\nproven to be successful. At this very moment, we are\r\nsuccessfully training a multi-ethnic police force as an\r\nimportant confidence-building measure.\r\nAll this would not be possible without the victory\r\nof democratic forces in Yugoslavia last year. This\r\ndemocratic revolution showed the strong will of the\r\nYugoslav people to live in a democratic society based\r\non the rule of law, with full respect for human and\r\nminority rights and a sustainable market economy. It\r\nalso showed their desire to live better lives in a more\r\nprosperous society, in peace with their neighbours and\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nas a part of the European family of nations. In order to\r\nachieve these goals, Yugoslavia has started a process of\r\ncomprehensive political and economic reforms over the\r\nlast year.\r\nAt the same time, we have to deal with several\r\npressing issues which are of crucial importance for the\r\ncountry. Foremost among these issues is the situation\r\nin Kosovo and Metohija, southern Serbia and the\r\nredefinition of the Yugoslav Federation, as well as\r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nestablished by the Security Council for the war crimes\r\ncommitted in the former Yugoslavia. However, these\r\nquestions do not concern Yugoslavia alone; they are\r\nalso of vital political importance for the entire region\r\nof South-East Europe. My Government has approached\r\nall of them in a constructive way and with a desire to\r\nfind political solutions through dialogue in a\r\ndemocratic environment.\r\nToday, all countries in South-East Europe have\r\ndemocratically elected Governments, and all are\r\nstriving to join European and Euro-Atlantic structures.\r\nAt the same time, our region is still burdened with the\r\nlegacy of the past 10 years and a number of\r\noutstanding issues, the main issue of which is the\r\nposition of national minorities. The problems of the\r\nregion are interrelated and must therefore be addressed\r\nby broad regional action and with the help of the\r\ninternational community. The solutions to be achieved\r\nshould enjoy region-wide support.\r\nI believe that the precondition for dealing with\r\nthe problems in the region is to fully respect the\r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries. It\r\nmust be clearly said that the era of disintegration in the\r\nBalkans has come to an end. This will enable us to\r\naddress the main problem of South-Eastern Europe —\r\nthe status of national minorities — with fewer\r\nreservations and much more openness. Solving the\r\nminority issues, together with more economic\r\ncooperation and new confidence-building measures, is\r\nthe way to achieve lasting stability and prosperity in\r\nthe region. Such an approach will be fully in concert\r\nwith the wishes of all countries in the region, including\r\nYugoslavia, to join the European integration processes.\r\nIn that context, Yugoslavia supports the process of\r\nstabilization and association, inaugurated by the\r\nEuropean Union at the Zagreb Summit last year, as\r\nwell as other regional initiatives.\r\nKosovo and Metohija is the most pressing and\r\nimmediate preoccupation of my Government. The\r\nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nfully complies with Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999). This is also what we rightly expect from others\r\nparticipating in its implementation and, in particular,\r\nneighbouring States.\r\nUnfortunately, we are not satisfied with the\r\nsituation in the field. There is no security for non-\r\nAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija; the return of\r\nexpelled and displaced persons is difficult and slow,\r\nand there is no progress with respect to the issue of\r\nmissing persons. Nonetheless, we signed the Common\r\nDocument with the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which\r\nshould provide for comprehensive cooperation in the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\r\n(1999). This enabled the President of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia and the Federal and Serbian\r\nRepublican Governments to call on the Serbs of\r\nKosovo and Metohija to take part in the elections. They\r\ndid so fully convinced that participation in the\r\nelections is in the Serbs’ best interest and that\r\ncooperation with the international community,\r\nparticularly with UNMIK and KFOR, is the key to the\r\nsolution of the situation in Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nThe elections to be held in Kosovo and Metohija\r\non 17 November are important indeed; yet, it is only\r\nafter the elections that I expect we will start even more\r\nextensive cooperation. This cooperation should be\r\naimed at implementing Security Council resolution\r\n1244 (1999) fully and at establishing democracy and\r\npromoting human rights in Kosovo and Metohija, with\r\nfull respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity\r\nof the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In that\r\nconnection, my delegation welcomes the presidential\r\nstatements issued by the Security Council on 5 October\r\nand 9 November 2001.\r\nI take this opportunity to affirm the support of the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia for the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly those of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, aimed at strengthening the role and place of\r\nthe world Organization in present-day international\r\nrelations.\r\nRecalling the conclusions of the Millennium\r\nAssembly, we expect that the General Assembly, the\r\nmain organ of the United Nations, will function more\r\neffectively. At the same time, the Organization should\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nbe more efficient in order to address the challenges\r\nbefore us. The Security Council should adapt itself to\r\nthe new relations in the international community.\r\nWe attach special significance to the international\r\nrule of law. It is of particular importance that all\r\ninternational crimes be punished before national and\r\ninternational courts. In that context, we firmly believe\r\nthat the International Criminal Court should start its\r\nwork as soon as possible. This is why my country has\r\nalready ratified the Statute of Rome that establishes the\r\nCourt.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that grave\r\nchallenges are before us. We have to take concerted\r\naction to deal with them. We have to be wise in how we\r\nact because that will determine the outlook of the\r\ninternational system for many years to come.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Turkmenistan, His Excellency\r\nMr. Rashid Meredov.\r\nMr. Meredov (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nFirst of all, on behalf of the Turkmenistan delegation, I\r\nwould like to express my deep condolences to the\r\nfamilies and relatives of the victims of the air crash\r\nthat happened yesterday in New York.\r\nI have the honour, on behalf of Mr. Saparmurat\r\nNiyazov, the President of Turkmenistan, to\r\ncongratulate the United Nations and Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan on receiving the prestigious Nobel Peace\r\nPrize, and I wish the United Nations every success in\r\nits effective and highly competent work aimed at\r\nsolving the thorniest problems affecting today’s world.\r\nMr. President, allow me to congratulate you on\r\nyour election as President of the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are confident that your\r\nexperience and knowledge will expedite the work of\r\nthe General Assembly most effectively.\r\nTurkmenistan is participating in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly for the tenth time as\r\nan independent entity in international relations and for\r\nthe sixth time as a State whose status of neutrality has\r\nbeen recognized by the community of nations. Since\r\nthe adoption of the General Assembly resolution 50/80\r\non the Permanent Neutrality of Turkmenistan, which is\r\nof historic significance for us, our young State has\r\nconsistently witnessed the support of the United\r\nNations in striving for peace and in our foreign policy\r\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening peace, security and\r\nstability. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would\r\nlike to convey to the heads of delegations present here\r\nand to the representatives of the member States of the\r\nUnited Nations the words of gratitude from President\r\nNiyazov and assure you of Turkmenistan’s unswerving\r\ncommitment to its international obligations as a\r\npermanently neutral State.\r\nRelations with the United Nations, based on close\r\ncooperation and strict observance of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the Organization, have been and remain at\r\nthe fore of Turkmenistan’s foreign policy strategy. For\r\nus, the United Nations is the main and universal\r\ndecision-making entity for the most crucial problems of\r\nglobal development. We share the view of the\r\nOrganization itself that providing it with a new impetus\r\nin view of the rapidly changing realities of today’s\r\nworld is of the utmost relevance. In our view the main\r\naspect of this new drive is respect for the overall\r\nbalance of interests on the basis of the fundamental\r\ncriteria underpinning the functioning of the\r\nOrganization, its ideals, the letter and the spirit of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. It is our firm belief that the\r\nUnited Nations has proven over the years of its\r\nexistence that it represents the most effective and just\r\nmechanism for resolving international issues. It is the\r\nmainstay of the whole system of international stability\r\nand security.\r\nTurkmenistan has always stood for, and continues\r\nto stand for, the strengthening and expansion of the\r\nUnited Nations role in the world. In this connection,\r\nwe believe that international law and the United\r\nNations Charter, which is based on principles of peace,\r\nequality, respect for nations and for their rights and\r\nsovereignty and choosing their own way of\r\ndevelopment, continue to serve as the basis for the\r\nworld order in this new century. This belief reflects our\r\nprinciples as a neutral State, the entire philosophy of\r\nour country’s foreign policy and our practice in this\r\ndecade-long participation in regional and international\r\naffairs.\r\nTurkmenistan attaches the utmost importance to\r\nits cooperation with the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies. Our Government and the United\r\nNations Development Programme jointly carry out a\r\nnumber of large-scale projects in the social and\r\neconomic spheres that have yielded good results for the\r\nenvironment and many other areas, including health,\r\neducation and ecology. Our cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\nNations Population Fund and other agencies has been\r\nmost effective. Turkmenistan will continue to maintain\r\nclose ties with these important agencies of the United\r\nNations in the search for new avenues of cooperation.\r\nWe consider interaction with United Nations\r\nbodies and agencies to be an important and useful\r\ninstrument in our regional, economic, cultural and\r\ninformational cooperation, as well as in our joint\r\nefforts with the Governments of neighbouring countries\r\nto implement other international programmes of\r\nvarious types. All of this undoubtedly fosters\r\nneighbourly relations and partnership ties in the region.\r\nTherefore, our country intends to focus in the future on\r\nmaintaining the closest possible contact with the\r\noffices of United Nations specialized agencies, whose\r\nimportance continues to grow.\r\nAlong these lines, I should like to draw particular\r\nattention to the situation that has emerged in our region\r\nsince the tragic events of 11 September in the United\r\nStates. It was with tremendous grief that the people of\r\nTurkmenistan heard the news from America. The\r\nPresident of Turkmenistan, on behalf of the people of\r\nour country, expressed sincere condolences to the\r\nfamilies and relatives of victims, and he addressed\r\nwords of consolation and compassion to all Americans.\r\nThese acts of terror have been unconditionally\r\ncondemned in our country. The Government of\r\nTurkmenistan was one of the first to make a statement\r\nin support of international efforts to combat terrorism\r\neffectively. Turkmenistan recommended uniting such\r\nefforts under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\nAction needs to be closely coordinated by the members\r\nof the international community on the basis of\r\ninternational law, ensuring that no manifestation of\r\nterrorism in this world will go unpunished and making\r\npossible effective and legitimate measures to combat\r\nthis evil.\r\nGiven what has happened, our country has\r\ncooperated actively with the United Nations in\r\nproviding transportation through Turkmenistan for\r\nhumanitarian supplies being sent to Afghanistan by\r\nUnited Nations specialized humanitarian relief\r\nagencies, including UNICEF, the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the World Food\r\nProgramme, as well as other governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. Turkmenistan’s\r\nconstructive position has received general support from\r\nthe United Nations and the majority of States in the\r\nworld.\r\nWe are greatly concerned over the situation in\r\nAfghanistan and the ongoing armed conflict in that\r\ncountry, which affects stability as well as social and\r\neconomic development in the region. Turkmenistan\r\nshares the view that there is no alternative to a peaceful\r\nresolution of the Afghanistan question through\r\nnegotiations. That is why we are convinced that the\r\nroad to peace in this long-suffering country lies in\r\npolitical negotiations under the auspices of the United\r\nNations. In this respect, we greatly appreciate the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to enhance the role of\r\nthe United Nations in finding a solution to the Afghan\r\ncrisis, because it is precisely the United Nations that\r\nmust play a role in working out international legal\r\nmechanisms to resolve the situation in Afghanistan.\r\nAs to the implementation of a strategy for\r\npeaceful development and cooperation in the region, I\r\nwould like to stress that the foreign policy of neutrality\r\npursued by Turkmenistan from the beginning follows\r\nprecisely this path. This point also touches on the\r\nquestion of exploiting the valuable hydrocarbon\r\ndeposits of the Caspian Sea Basin, which involves not\r\nonly regional interests but also the interests of many\r\nother nations of the world as well as those of trans-\r\nnational companies. It is our policy to take those\r\ninterests into account.\r\nNaturally, the oil and natural gas deposits in the\r\nCaspian Sea are extremely important energy resources\r\nfor the twenty-first century. Their rational and effective\r\nexploitation, and the construction of an appropriate\r\npipeline infrastructure to deliver these energy supplies\r\nto world markets, will ensure considerable economic\r\ngrowth for many States and the welfare of their people.\r\nThe United Nations can play an important role in this\r\nprocess, as it is capable of creating a mechanism to\r\nguarantee the safe and unimpeded transportation of\r\nsuch raw materials along inter-State pipelines. As the\r\nAssembly will recall, Turkmenistan put forward this\r\nidea at the Millennium Summit and suggested that an\r\ninternational convention should be worked out in this\r\nregard.\r\nEffective economic activity in the Caspian is\r\ninherently linked to ensuring stability in the Caspian\r\nregion. Turkmenistan believes that the Caspian Sea\r\narea should be a zone of peace, stability and sustained\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.50\r\ninternational cooperation based on the principles of\r\njustice and mutual respect.\r\nIt is clear that the problems now faced by\r\nMember States of the United Nations are complex and\r\nmanifold. Their solution is possible not only through\r\ncollective efforts but also through the necessary\r\nrecognition of the individual role and responsibility of\r\neach nation as a member of the world community. It is\r\nthis logic of political behaviour that Turkmenistan has\r\nin mind when it limits itself to the goals of\r\nstrengthening peace and promoting economic, social\r\nand cultural development. Our country is always ready\r\nfor constructive partnership, and the United Nations\r\nknows that it can always rely on Turkmenistan.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
