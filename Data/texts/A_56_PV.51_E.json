(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Pierre Charles, Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Commonwealth of Dominica.\r\nThe Honourable Pierre Charles, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Pierre\r\nCharles, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Commonwealth of Dominica and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Charles (Dominica): I am pleased and\r\nhonoured to address the Assembly on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica. I wish to extend my congratulations to you,\r\nSir, and your country, the Republic of Korea, on your\r\nelection to the high office of President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, confident that your\r\nproven diplomatic skills will serve you well in guiding\r\nthe affairs of the General Assembly with efficiency and\r\npurpose. Your immediate predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, is most deserving of our thanks and\r\nappreciation for the very able manner in which he\r\npresided over the Millennium Summit and the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly. Permit me\r\nfurther to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, on his election to a second term and on the\r\naward of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the United\r\nNations.\r\nThis general debate is being conducted in unusual\r\ncircumstances. The horrendous terrorist acts of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 have altered the lives of many in ways\r\ntraumatic and fundamentally tragic. I must again\r\nextend deepest condolences and pledge the full support\r\nand solidarity of the Government and the people of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica to the Government and\r\nthe people of the United States of America and to all\r\nbereaved families, including those who lost their loved\r\nones on flight 587.\r\nThe ripple effects of those acts have resonated in\r\nlocations far removed from New York City,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, aggravating\r\neconomic and social conditions and seriously\r\ndisrupting efforts aimed at meeting the many\r\nchallenges confronting the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community. In short, in one way or\r\nanother and to a lesser or greater degree, we are all\r\nvictims of those acts of terrorism that were visited\r\nupon the United States of America two months ago.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica condemns,\r\nwithout reservation, what is undoubtedly the worst\r\nterrorist act of our times. We are in strong accord with\r\nthe sentiments and mandates contained in Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) and\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/1, all of which call\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nupon the international community to take unified and\r\ncooperative action to prevent and eradicate acts of\r\nterrorism. We understand the need for the exercise of\r\nthe right of self-defence in pursuit of those objectives,\r\nand we support the actions being taken to bring justice\r\nto the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of the\r\nterrorist acts of 11 September 2001.\r\nCognizant of the importance of international\r\ncooperation in the fight against terrorism, Dominica\r\nhas proceeded to establish a task force to put in place\r\nthe necessary legislative and executive measures for\r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001). But to be effective beyond the immediate\r\ncrisis, counter-terrorism measures, mechanisms and\r\nstrategies must be sustained through a comprehensive\r\napproach that seeks to create and strengthen, through\r\nthe United Nations, a legal framework against\r\ninternational terrorism, complemented by strenuous\r\nefforts aimed at improving the social and economic\r\nconditions which adversely affect the poor and\r\ndispossessed.\r\nBeyond the immediate peace and security issues\r\naffected by the events of 11 September, there has been\r\na considerable impact on the global economy, which\r\nhas been thrown into an accelerated decline, with\r\nconsequences that are particularly disturbing for small\r\ndeveloping countries like the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica. In the Caribbean there is strong evidence of\r\ndamage to vital sectors of our economy, such as\r\ntourism, financial services and agriculture. The actual\r\nand projected losses of jobs in the region are in the\r\nthousands, and for those countries that were already\r\nexperiencing fiscal pressures the prospect of higher\r\nunemployment and decreased revenues is daunting.\r\nComplicating the problem is the great concern\r\nthat in the fight against terrorism and in the drive to\r\nenforce counter-terrorism measures, certain areas in\r\nwhich developing countries in the Caribbean region\r\nhave a competitive advantage, such as the financial\r\nservices sector, may be subjected to inordinate pressure\r\nand be unfairly targeted and linked to illegal activities\r\nsuch as money-laundering. We are convinced that well-\r\nregulated, competitive tax jurisdictions should be\r\ntreated separately and distinctly from illegal activities\r\nsuch as money-laundering. The Commonwealth of\r\nDominica remains firmly committed to the struggle\r\nagainst international terrorism to the same extent that\r\nwe strive to ensure that our financial services sector, a\r\nmajor pillar of our economic diversification thrust,\r\ndoes not provide support to the perpetrators of criminal\r\nactivity in the financing of terrorism.\r\nThe current effort against international terrorism\r\nis important, and our focus on that activity is\r\nwarranted. There are, however, other dimensions of the\r\nglobal agenda which should command the attention of\r\nthe international community and the United Nations.\r\nThey cannot be relegated to the back burner of our\r\nconcerns. They comprise a wide range of economic,\r\nsocial, political and humanitarian problems faced on a\r\ndaily basis and, for the most part, by the poor and\r\ndisadvantaged of the world. Indeed, some of them are\r\nlikely to be exacerbated by the fight against terrorism,\r\nand their successful resolution will continue to be the\r\ngreatest challenge of the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit last year there was\r\ngeneral agreement on the issues needing urgent\r\nattention and the goals to be achieved. One year later\r\nthose goals appear to be as far from being realized as\r\never. Commitment appears to be lacking on all fronts.\r\nThe objective of a 50 per cent reduction in the number\r\nof persons living in poverty worldwide by the year\r\n2015 suffers from the perennially tepid effort to deal\r\nwith the root causes of poverty. Contributions from the\r\nindustrial countries are woefully inadequate, and the\r\nrequired adjustment of the strategies of the\r\ninternational financial institutions is slow in coming.\r\nThe outcome is less than desirable in creating and\r\nmaintaining an enabling environment for the more\r\neffective management of projects geared to poverty\r\nreduction.\r\nThat lack of commitment is evident in other\r\nareas. A year after the Millennium Summit and six\r\nmonths after the General Assembly special session on\r\nHIV/AIDS, the international community seems to have\r\nlost interest in a crisis that the Secretary-General\r\nlabelled the greatest public health challenge of our\r\ntimes. As front-page news, HIV/AIDS claimed\r\nattention for only a short time after the special session,\r\nbut the disease claimed millions of lives last year and\r\ncreated millions of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa,\r\nwhich continues to have the highest rates of infection.\r\nThe Caribbean region ranks a close second.\r\nThe Global Fund for AIDS and Health proposed\r\nby the Secretary-General is clearly not realizing its\r\nspending target of $7 billion to $10 billion, and will not\r\nbe able to achieve the stated goal of reversing the\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS by 2015, as declared by world\r\nleaders at the Millennium Summit. The majority of\r\npeople infected with HIV/AIDS live in the developing\r\nworld and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS infection is\r\nconsidered a function of poverty. The circularity of the\r\nproblem has tremendous implications for economic\r\ndevelopment, poverty reduction and efforts to raise\r\nliving standards in developing countries. The accepted\r\npremise is that international development cooperation\r\nplays a vital role in the development of the mechanisms\r\nnecessary for enhancing the trade competitiveness of\r\ndeveloping countries, strengthening financial systems,\r\nand developing human resources, but that role is\r\nclearly undermined by the declining trend in official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA).\r\nMr. Orellana Rojas (Guatemala), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nOnce again we see the lack of commitment to the\r\nfulfilment of a stated goal. It is generally accepted that\r\nwere industrialized countries to meet their promised\r\nofficial development assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product (GNP), the countries of the\r\ndeveloping world would be much nearer to solving\r\nmany of the problems with which they are plagued. As\r\na substitute for the failed promise, developing\r\ncountries have been told to place greater reliance on\r\nforeign direct investment, most of which bypasses the\r\nmost needy and the smallest economies. The\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica falls into that category of\r\nStates for which official development assistance is\r\nvitally critical to the development of their economies.\r\nThat is why the Commonwealth of Dominica and other\r\nStates in the region attach such importance to the\r\nconvening of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, which will be held in\r\nMexico from 18 to 22 March 2002. Given the changing\r\nglobal realities that are impacting adversely on the\r\neconomies of developing States, the Conference will\r\nprovide an opportunity for us to assess the impact of\r\ndeclining official development assistance and for\r\ncreating new mechanisms for financing development.\r\nOver the past several years and in many different\r\nforums, particularly in the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO), we have been calling for the formal\r\nrecognition of the special problems facing small\r\nvulnerable economies. We fear that without such\r\nrecognition it will be impossible for small States to be\r\nfully integrated into the multilateral trading system of\r\nthe globalized world. Our fears have been confirmed\r\nboth by the generally poor performance of small States\r\nunder WTO arrangements and by a very authoritative\r\nreport by the World Bank and Commonwealth\r\nSecretariat on the issue of smallness and vulnerability.\r\nThe unique characteristics of small vulnerable\r\neconomies, which have been articulated in numerous\r\nstudies, give a clear indication of the challenges that\r\nthese economies face in improving their development\r\nprospects and in adjusting to liberalization and\r\nglobalization. Many of these economies are at a\r\ncrossroads. The reality is that trade preferences are\r\neroding; official flows are declining, while historical\r\nties with former partners in development are fading. It\r\nis therefore imperative that in order to prevent further\r\nmarginalization of small economies, steps must be\r\ntaken in the multilateral trading system and elsewhere\r\nto address the concerns of those economies and to\r\nensure their growth and development.\r\nThe exclusion of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan from membership of the United Nations makes\r\nlittle sense in today’s world of globalization and\r\ninterdependence, particularly in light of the fact that\r\nthis sovereign State, with a democratically elected\r\nGovernment, is the world’s seventeenth largest\r\neconomy, the fifteenth largest in international trade, the\r\neighth largest foreign investor, the fourth largest in\r\nterms of foreign exchange reserves, and the third\r\nlargest exporter of information technology (IT)\r\nproducts. The Commonwealth of Dominica intends no\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of any Member\r\nState, nor can such interpretation be validly applied to\r\nour action. Our plea is a simple call for justice for the\r\n23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nand an appeal for the recognition of their right to be\r\ntreated in international affairs no differently from\r\ncitizens of any other country.\r\nThe eleventh of September 2001 will undoubtedly\r\nbe remembered for the horrifying nature of the terrorist\r\nacts, the magnitude of the senseless destruction of lives\r\nand property and the forced recognition of our common\r\nvulnerability. But the heroism, the extraordinary\r\nfortitude and selflessness of ordinary men and women,\r\nand the demonstrated triumph of the human spirit over\r\nthe worst manifestation of evil, inspire us to hope that\r\nwith dedicated commitment we can create for all\r\nmankind a world that is measurably better than that\r\nwhich we have today. The time to begin is now.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica for the statement he has\r\njust made.\r\nThe Honourable Pierre Charles, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to Mr. George Papandreou, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Greece.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece): Allow me to\r\ncongratulate the President, Mr. Han Seung-soo, on his\r\nelection and also to express my deep appreciation to\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Holkeri, for his excellent work\r\nduring the past year.\r\nThe nations that constitute this Organization are\r\ntoday attempting to draft a comprehensive convention\r\nagainst terrorism, a difficult but absolutely necessary\r\ntask. We may not yet agree on how to define terrorism,\r\nhowever the world, with a near unanimous voice,\r\ncondemned the 11 September events. The world\r\nshowed solidarity with the American people, the\r\nUnited States Government, and President Bush. That\r\nhighlights a simple truth and a profound consensus, a\r\nconsensus that this was an act against humanity, a\r\nconsensus that this was a crime against the values we\r\nhold dear as human beings and as societies, and a\r\nconsensus that justice must be done.\r\nFrom the ruins of this tragedy there rises a\r\nnewborn moral strength, a clarion call to change this\r\nworld, a call to create a moral order, a world\r\ncommunity of values where a genuine sense of justice\r\ncan prevail. It is in our hands today — in fact it is our\r\nresponsibility to rise to this occasion, take a bold step\r\nbeyond our traditional rivalries and consolidate a new\r\nspirit of cooperation. Let us make this a common fight\r\nfor humanity. To do so we need not abandon our\r\nnational interests. We do, however, need to place them\r\nin a wider context, a world order based on common\r\npractices, shared principles and global values. We must\r\ngo beyond rhetoric. That also means that our\r\nresponsibilities must reach beyond our borders.\r\nWhether it be a child who is suffering from AIDS in\r\nAfrica, an Afghan refugee facing starvation, or a\r\nhuman being discriminated against because of race, sex\r\nor religion — these are today our shared\r\nresponsibilities. Whether it be our threatened\r\nenvironment, the need for sustainable development, the\r\nneed for equal educational opportunities, access to the\r\nInternet, or the inclusion of the poor in the fruits of\r\ndevelopment — these are today our shared\r\nresponsibilities. Nuclear weapons proliferation,\r\nweapons of mass destruction and the protection of\r\nchildren in conflict situations — these also are today\r\nour shared responsibilities. No events could have made\r\nit clearer than did those we witnessed with horror on 11\r\nSeptember. We live in one world and no problem is\r\nonly our neighbour’s problem, it is also our problem.\r\nThat underlines the need for a universal response\r\nto the challenges that the citizens of this global village\r\nface. It underlines the need for standards concerning\r\nprinciples and practices that guarantee justice — from\r\nthe Middle East to Cyprus, to Afghanistan and to\r\nKosovo. The need for these principles underlines the\r\npivotal role of the United Nations. I should like to\r\nexpress our warm support, respect and gratitude for the\r\ntireless efforts of Kofi Annan. Heartfelt congratulations\r\nto him and to the Organization he represents, the\r\nUnited Nations, on the award of this year’s Nobel\r\nPeace Prize. It is a well-deserved accolade, an accolade\r\nthat carries with it a heightened sense of responsibility\r\nto provide global governance in this globalized\r\nworld — a world of global problems and global\r\nopportunities. Greece very much agrees with the words\r\nof Louis Michel, speaking in his capacity as President\r\nof the European Union, in support of the International\r\nCriminal Court and the continued reform of the United\r\nNations.\r\nToday in our search for justice on a global scale,\r\nour challenge is to seek moral clarity. We must be able\r\nto unite around what is right. The words “freedom”,\r\n“democracy”, “human and minority rights”, “equality”,\r\n“peaceful resolution of conflict”, “solidarity”,\r\n“inclusion”, “open society”, “multiculturalism”,\r\n“tolerance” and “biodiversity” must all become the\r\ncore of our common values. Yet there are different\r\ninterpretations and different practices in our world\r\nconcerning these concepts. In our search for a common\r\nmoral code we must not allow a clash of cultures. We\r\nmust seek a dialogue of cultures, and from this\r\ndialogue of nations, cultures and religions, a common\r\nmoral code and order can and will emerge. The Charter\r\nof the United Nations embodies these values. Our\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nchallenge today is collectively to give practical\r\nmeaning to them. I should like to mention an important\r\nstep in recognizing and respecting the dignity and\r\ndiversity of our cultures in the world. Greece has tabled\r\na resolution on the return of cultural property.\r\nGreece has always stood at a crossroads of\r\ncultures. Our best moments have been when we used\r\nthat richness to learn. Today we are doing so again.\r\nGreece is a member of the European Union and of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, yet its roots in the\r\nEast enrich us in equal measure. We are proud to be\r\nEuropean and Balkan and Mediterranean. We once\r\nwere a nation of emigrants and our diaspora has linked\r\nus to all corners of the earth. Today we are a country\r\nthat welcomes immigrants. They make up more than 10\r\nper cent of our population.\r\nOurs is an open, multicultural society in the truest\r\nsense of the word. We see and we understand the world\r\nthrough many eyes. We understand that there are\r\ndifferent truths and different histories. Yet we approach\r\nour traditions not as a wall that isolates us from each\r\nother, but as depositories of knowledge and sources of\r\nunderstanding and communication between cultures.\r\nWe believe that our histories cannot enslave us, they\r\nmust become our way of learning for the future.\r\nThis commitment to dialogue is also a\r\ncommitment to reach specific, practical results that will\r\nenhance our region’s ability and the world\r\ncommunity’s capacity to establish well-respected\r\nvalues and principles in dealing with world problems\r\nsuch as terrorism. But in our fight against terrorism we\r\nmust uphold these principles, as they differentiate us\r\nfrom those who use violence as their means. We must\r\nalso heed what the Secretary-General in his address\r\nstressed. The problems we all shared prior to 11\r\nSeptember have not disappeared. However, I am\r\nencouraged to report that we have made significant\r\nstrides in our own region of South-Eastern Europe. We\r\ndid so by committing ourselves to serve these values:\r\nhuman and minority rights, democratic institutions,\r\ngood-neighbourly relations and the inviolability of\r\nborders. We remain committed to the principle that\r\nshould differences and disagreements emerge, we will\r\nseek to resolve them peacefully with respect to\r\ninternational law. We have managed to establish the\r\nframework of common values, one that will help us to\r\ncooperate to solve our problems. Emerging from a state\r\nof despair, the Balkans today represents a ray of hope\r\nfor all regions in conflict.\r\nOf course there is much to do. Let me list the\r\npriorities. We must turn provisional peace into\r\npermanent peace. We can do so by resolving\r\noutstanding bilateral issues. We must turn new-found\r\ndemocracies into permanent and active democracies.\r\nWe can do so by building civic capacity and strong\r\ntransparent institutions that will guarantee the rule of\r\nlaw. We must contain and eradicate organized crime, a\r\npoison that runs through new-found democracies and is\r\noften linked to terrorist networks. We must turn\r\nopportunistic capital investment into entrepreneurial\r\ninitiatives and permanent business propositions that\r\nprovide youth with the prospect of a better and more\r\nsecure future. We must turn segregated communities\r\ninto multicultural societies, and we can do so by\r\ninvesting in education. Greece has committed\r\nresources, and of course its political will, to the above.\r\nWe cannot stop now. As a world community we must\r\ncontinue and we must strengthen our investment in\r\npeople and in financial resources until our work is\r\ncomplete.\r\nTwo years ago I stood before you here with my\r\nTurkish colleague Ismail Cem, expressing the hope for\r\na new beginning in our relations, relations which\r\nhistory seems to have frozen into constant rivalry and\r\nconflict. Today I need not express only hope; I can\r\nreport that we have made significant progress. I have\r\njust come from a meeting with my Turkish counterpart\r\nwhere we signed a series of new agreements. Our\r\nmeetings have become frequent and regular. We work\r\ntogether. We learn together. We help each other out in\r\ntimes of difficulty and crisis. We have discovered the\r\nimportance of being good neighbours. We have started\r\nto develop a common architecture of trust. The\r\nproducts of our efforts are significant. We are\r\nconstantly adding confidence-building measures to\r\nassure peace in the Aegean.\r\nWe have made a commitment to jointly become\r\nparties to the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of\r\nthe Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-\r\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction, and we\r\nhave taken steps to cooperate against natural disasters.\r\nWe are cooperating in the fight against crime, drug\r\ntrafficking, illegal migration and terrorism. We are\r\ncooperating in tourism. Our trade has doubled. Energy\r\nand agriculture have emerged as new fields of further\r\ncooperation. Our two societies have taken the initiative\r\nto commence and develop common economic, cultural,\r\neducational and athletic activities.\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nThese achievements stand as a reminder of the\r\nresponse of our people after the earthquakes, when they\r\nsent us a message saying:\r\n“We have more in common than what separates\r\nus; we are all equally vulnerable to pain and\r\nsuffering; equally capable of sympathy and\r\ncompassion; equally responsible for the life we\r\noffer to the generations that are to follow.”\r\nAgain this year Greece and Turkey will jointly submit\r\na draft resolution on emergency disaster relief. Our\r\nneighbour’s path towards the European Union, a path\r\nwe wholeheartedly support, has set a new framework\r\nwithin which many of our remaining differences can be\r\nresolved. Step by step we are building a solid\r\nfoundation.\r\nOf course our work in the region is far from\r\ncomplete. The architecture of trust we are building in\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe is significantly hindered by the\r\nsituation in Cyprus, for the question of Cyprus remains\r\nunresolved. The island remains divided in a shameful\r\ncondition. Cyprus is a tragic example of where our\r\nshared sense of justice, our code of values, has gone\r\nastray. Yet here is a new opportunity. Both the Greek\r\nCypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities could\r\nbenefit from the island’s membership in the European\r\nUnion. It is a win-win situation. I sincerely believe that\r\nevery Greek aspires to a solution on Cyprus that will\r\nsatisfy both communities, a solution imposed by no one\r\nparty and accepted by all. I believe that that is what\r\nevery citizen in neighbouring Turkey aspires to as well.\r\nOur constant reference to United Nations\r\nresolutions that clearly call for the creation of a\r\nbizonal, bicommunal federation cannot be interpreted\r\nas a desire for outside imposition — both communities\r\nhave suffered terribly from outside intervention. On the\r\ncontrary, this call expresses our deep belief in justice\r\nfor Cyprus, a sense of justice for both communities.\r\nThat is what the United Nations framework can\r\nguarantee.\r\nI therefore appeal to the Turkish leadership to use\r\nthat framework for a just solution. Let us not expand\r\nthe wall that divides the two communities in Cyprus to\r\ndivide Turkey from Europe. Let us instead break down\r\nthis last Berlin Wall in Europe and help to create a\r\ncommon future for the citizens of a free Cyprus. To all\r\nof us in the region, a region seeking to eliminate\r\ndivision, the prospect of the island’s entrance into the\r\nunited European family should be a source of euphoria,\r\nnot fear.\r\nIf we do share a common moral order, a common\r\nunderstanding of what is right and wrong, then the\r\nMiddle East peace process had come close to\r\narticulating the principles we share. For the good of the\r\npeople in the region and its stability, that process must\r\ncontinue until a Palestinian State lives peacefully next\r\nto a secure Israel. That peace process must begin anew,\r\nwithout preconditions, based on secure initial steps\r\nthrough the implementation of the Mitchell report\r\nrecommendations. Greece, as both a member of the\r\nEuropean Union and a neighbour to the Middle East,\r\nwill commit its efforts in this crucial situation towards\r\nthe support of peace, rapprochement and reconciliation.\r\nWe also hope that the hardships of the people of\r\nIraq will cease and that the country will be fully\r\nintegrated into the world community under a leadership\r\nthat cooperates with the international community and\r\ncomplies with United Nations resolutions. That is also\r\nour stand with regard to Afghanistan. We look forward\r\nto the day that its Government represents its people and\r\nleads them closer to the world community. Here,\r\nGreece has already committed substantial resources\r\ntowards alleviating the humanitarian problem of the\r\nAfghanis.\r\nAt times when it is easy to succumb to fear we\r\nmust have the strength to build confidence within and\r\namong our societies. We must be able to celebrate\r\nhumanity in this global village, to go beyond our\r\ndifferences and conflicts. One such occasion is the\r\nOlympic Games. They are an ancient tradition that\r\ngrew out of the need for peace in the ancient world of\r\nHellenism. Today the five rings of the Olympic Games,\r\nwhich represent five continents, are the most\r\nrecognized symbol on this planet, surpassing any\r\ncommercial logo. Let us use this global celebration to\r\nfurther strengthen our community of common values.\r\nLet us again pledge our commitment to the Olympic\r\nTruce which the Secretary-General has so strongly\r\nsupported and the Millennium Summit has called for.\r\nIsmail Cem and I have only recently signed a\r\ndeclaration to this effect. Many ministers of the\r\nBalkans, Europe and the Mediterranean have followed.\r\nI invite all to become co-signatories.\r\nWe see that Truce as a moment in time powerful\r\nenough to change the world. During the ceasefire in\r\nBosnia the Olympic Truce helped the Red Cross to\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nvaccinate hundreds of children. The two Koreas\r\nparading under the same flag at the Sydney Games was\r\na powerful moment, witnessed by millions around the\r\nworld. We see truce as a time to reflect. We see truce as\r\na moment of silence. We see truce as a time to\r\nquestion, to examine what we believe. We see truce as\r\na time to heal our wounds. We can use this pause from\r\nviolence to celebrate and to rejoice, and we can use it\r\nto mourn and to remember. In Salt Lake City we can\r\nuse it to honour all those unjustly lost. If our global\r\nquest for peace is a journey of 1,000 miles, then truce\r\nis but the small first step. But imagine how glorious the\r\nrest of our journey can be if we celebrate humanity, if\r\nwe give peace a chance and commit ourselves to that\r\nfirst step.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Kavan (Czech Republic): Let me\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly and wish him every success in this important\r\npost. At the same time, I take this opportunity to offer\r\nmy most sincere congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, and the entire United Nations on\r\nthe occasion of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize award, and\r\nto express my gratitude for their determination to\r\ndefend the ideas of tolerance and mutual respect among\r\nnations.\r\nAllow me to extend my own and my country’s\r\ndeepest sympathy to all those who lost loved ones in\r\nthe horrible terrorist attacks of 11 September. We are\r\ndeeply moved by the unspeakable tragedy and share the\r\ngrief of the American people and of all those affected.\r\nWe perceive the horrifying attack as an attack against\r\nthe entire civilized international community against the\r\nprinciples of freedom, democracy and peace, the\r\nprinciples upon which the Organization stands. In the\r\naftermath of the attacks of 11 September, the concepts\r\nof security, peace and solidarity are acquiring a new\r\nand distinct meaning. We recognize the growing\r\ninterdependency of individual actors on the\r\ninternational scene. The dangers of the new threats and\r\nrisks that confront our civilization come to the\r\nforefront. To conquer them we must not only move\r\nenergetically against the perpetrators, but also\r\nconcentrate on the causes that propel them.\r\nAt the same time, we are witnessing significant\r\nprogress leading to the creation of new relationships in\r\nthe international community. The fact that we were\r\nable to create such a wide anti-terrorist coalition so\r\nswiftly is very encouraging indeed. It is imperative to\r\nstrengthen that coalition and enable it not only to fight\r\neffectively against terrorism but also to contribute to\r\nsolving other pressing problems, especially those\r\nwhose solution will strengthen the struggle against\r\nterrorism by reducing tension and promoting justice\r\nand stability. The current, unusually wide, international\r\ncoalition against terrorism presents, I believe, a unique\r\nopportunity that we should seize. We should do our\r\nutmost to make it effective and operational. We should\r\ndo our utmost not to let it collapse for reasons that\r\nwould not stand up to the inevitable future scrutiny of\r\nour sons and daughters. We should do our utmost to\r\navoid the trap of allowing the struggle against\r\nterrorism, the struggle for peace, justice, stability and\r\ncoexistence, to be replaced by a clash of civilizations,\r\nby the very war that Osama bin Laden is calling for, by\r\na war against Islam. That would be a tragedy.\r\nThe international community has at its disposal\r\ngreat potential to address even the most complex\r\nproblems and crises. It must now reach an agreement\r\non how to approach them and on which tools it will\r\nemploy to address them. International organizations,\r\nand the United Nations specifically, play an\r\nirreplaceable role in this process.\r\nThe Czech Republic is determined to contribute\r\nto the search for effective ways to meet the most\r\npressing challenges of today and to support the\r\ninternational response to terrorism and the actions\r\nundertaken so far, especially if the military operation\r\ncontinues to be targeted as accurately as possible\r\nagainst military targets, in this, it is hoped, the final\r\nstage of the Taliban’s defeat. We view these actions as\r\nlegitimate and in accordance with the United Nations\r\nCharter and United Nations Security Council resolution\r\n1368 (2001). Today more than ever we feel it our duty\r\nand obligation to preserve and cherish the uniqueness,\r\nas well as the open and universal character, of the\r\nUnited Nations and push more decisively for a\r\nstrengthening of the role we have entrusted to it.\r\nWhen we approach these most pressing\r\nchallenges we must be proactive. For its part, the\r\nCzech Republic is determined to carry its share. The\r\nCzech Republic has submitted its candidacy for the\r\npresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nAssembly of the United Nations. We hold this highly\r\ndemanding and prestigious position in great respect and\r\nare determined to actively participate in the realization\r\nof the demanding tasks ahead of us, in the most\r\nresponsible manner. We are prepared to be attentive to\r\nyour voices and concerns and to serve the entire\r\nmembership. We obviously wish to help with the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nincluding the eradication of extreme poverty and the\r\nintegration of human rights into every aspect of our\r\nwork, as we were so eloquently reminded by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan a few days ago. We need to inch\r\nforward the necessary reform of the United Nations\r\nsystem, strengthen the role of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly, help to challenge the\r\nmarginalization of important continents such as Africa,\r\nLatin America and parts of Asia. We need also to help\r\nthe United Nations to play an effective role in the\r\nstruggle against international terrorism.\r\nIt is clear that accomplishing the objective of\r\nfinding and bringing to justice the perpetrators of the\r\nattacks on the United States is most urgent and topical.\r\nHowever, other phases can be embarked upon at the\r\nsame time. I agree with the President of Pakistan,\r\nGeneral Pervez Musharraf, who said at this Assembly\r\nthat a three-pronged strategy is needed: first, to go after\r\nthe main culprits, the individual terrorists; secondly, to\r\nmove decisively against the terrorist organizations; and\r\nthirdly — what in my opinion is very important — to\r\naddress unresolved disputes, which proliferate\r\nthroughout the world and must be resolved in a helpful\r\nand just manner. As I listened carefully to speeches\r\ndelivered here over the last few days by many leading\r\npoliticians of the world, I was pleased to confirm my\r\nconviction that not only the Czech Republic or the\r\nEuropean Union, but also many other countries argue\r\nthat the fight against terrorism should combine the\r\nnecessary military operations with, above all, decisive\r\nattempts to eradicate the root causes of terrorism. It is\r\ntherefore necessary to pay far greater attention to\r\nconflicts that provide fertile soil for terrorism, because\r\nif conflicts remain unresolved for decades, they give\r\nrise to feelings of frustration, despair and\r\npowerlessness or, as the President of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran put it, to alienation, extremism and\r\nlawlessness. Political solutions of conflicts, many of\r\nwhich are essentially political conflicts, will reduce\r\ntensions, promote peace and fairness and, especially,\r\ntake the wind out of the sails of those who put forward\r\nthe absurd myth that terrorist actions can bring about\r\nanything other than loss of the lives of innocent people\r\nand the exacerbation of problems and conflicts.\r\nIn our fight against terrorism we need to look for\r\ncomprehensive solutions and to that end employ all\r\navailable tools to identify, isolate and destroy the\r\nterrorist networks and to combat terrorism as a whole.\r\nOur anti-terrorist striving must equally concentrate on\r\ncombating international organized crime, people\r\nsmuggling, and drug and arms trafficking. On the\r\nfinancial front it is necessary to cut terrorists off from\r\ntheir resources. A determined focus on preventing\r\nmoney-laundering is a crucial aspect of this effort.\r\nLong-term and extensive development assistance aimed\r\nat alleviating the most pressing problems of the\r\ndeveloping world should be an integral part of these\r\nefforts by the international community.\r\nThe Czech Republic sees the upholding of the\r\nunity and operational readiness of the international\r\ncoalition combating terrorism as the most imperative\r\ntask of the day. We, the international community,\r\nshould not lose this unique opportunity but should take\r\ndecisive action. The fight against terrorism is a long-\r\nterm mission and will have an impact on all aspects of\r\nour lives. At the national level, the Czech Republic is\r\npreparing a national plan for combating terrorism,\r\nwhich is inspired by the Action Plan of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nIn recent weeks the United Nations has shown its\r\nrenewed resolve to combat international terrorism. We\r\ncommend the Security Council for its swift action and\r\nwe support the adoption of Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001) to combat\r\nthreats to international peace and security caused by\r\nterrorist acts. The Czech Republic is taking all\r\nnecessary steps towards the full implementation of the\r\nprovisions of resolution 1373 (2001), and fully\r\nsupports the actions of the relevant Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee.\r\nMy strong belief in the need for political and\r\ndiplomatic moves does not in any way suggest that one\r\nshould negotiate with the terrorists. Just the contrary.\r\nTerrorists have to be defeated and brought to justice.\r\nThere can be no negotiations with the terrorists. The\r\nevil of terrorism must be eradicated. The fight against\r\nterrorism has a higher priority than ever before, and\r\nnobody can stay neutral in this fight. The Czech\r\nRepublic is proud that it was able to offer both military\r\nand humanitarian help to the efforts led by the United\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nStates. The Czech Republic is proud that some of its\r\nhelp was accepted and thus that some of our best\r\nsoldiers can now actively contribute to these joint\r\nendeavours.\r\nAs I have said, conflicts can be a breeding ground\r\nfor terrorism. Terrorism fully exploits unresolved\r\nconflicts and profits from their expansion. Therefore\r\nour intensified fight against terrorism points\r\nunequivocally to the need for the international\r\ncommunity to pay far greater attention to conflict\r\nresolution in various regions. The United Nations must\r\ncontinue its major role in maintaining peace and\r\nsecurity throughout the world by applying an integrated\r\napproach of conflict prevention, peacekeeping\r\noperations and post-conflict reconstruction.\r\nRecognition of the roots of conflicts and\r\neducation towards tolerance must be incorporated into\r\nour preventive strategies. We fully support the\r\nimplementation of the comprehensive overhaul of the\r\npeacekeeping operations as proposed by the Brahimi\r\nreport (A/55/305) and other recent reports focusing on\r\nthis issue. The recent liberation of Mazar-e-Sharif in\r\nnorthern Afghanistan, and even the most recent fall of\r\nKabul, improve our possibilities of supplying the\r\nAfghan people with the humanitarian aid that they so\r\nbadly need. That must remain at the forefront of our\r\nendeavours. We should do our utmost to alleviate the\r\nsuffering of the innocent Afghan people. I believe there\r\nis an extremely important role for the United Nations\r\nto play in the consolidation of the post-Taliban Afghan\r\nState that is so desperately needed. We should fully\r\nsupport the current efforts of the United Nations, and\r\nespecially those of Ambassador Brahimi, to form as\r\nsoon as possible a stable, broad-based Government that\r\nwill reflect the ethnic diversity of the country. I agree\r\nwith Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that the one\r\ninstitution in the world that can deliver that better\r\nfuture is the United Nations.\r\nThe greatest tensions today undoubtedly prevail\r\nin the Middle East. It is regrettable that much of the\r\nprogress achieved in the past few years seems to have\r\nbeen squandered. But the uphill struggle that faces us\r\nthere is no reason for doing nothing and letting things\r\nget worse and would only mean that more people will\r\nsuffer and die. The Czech Republic is a traditional and\r\nactive supporter of the peace process in the Middle\r\nEast. We cannot reconcile ourselves with the current\r\nsetbacks. The political violence must be halted.\r\nDiplomatic initiatives aimed at bringing the parties\r\nback to the negotiating table must be fully supported.\r\nThe Czech Republic fully supports the right of the\r\nPalestinians to their own viable and independent State.\r\nNevertheless, its final shape should be the result of\r\nbilateral Palestinian-Israeli negotiations with the full\r\nbacking of the international community.\r\nThe international community has been\r\nencouraged by the change in political leadership in the\r\nBalkans, which offers a new opportunity to secure\r\ngenuine peace and economic reconstruction. The\r\nupcoming local parliamentary elections in Kosovo will\r\nbe an important moment in the stabilization process. I\r\nshould like to use this opportunity to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General and his Special Representative in\r\nKosovo, Hans Haekkerup, for their work in the region.\r\nOur admiration also goes to the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the\r\nKosovo Force (KFOR).\r\nIn Africa, despite some progress, not only\r\npoverty and AIDS but also armed conflict remain\r\nmajor challenges to the United Nations and the entire\r\ninternational community. Although the destiny of the\r\ncontinent lies in the hands of the Africans, the\r\ninternational community should strengthen its efforts to\r\nassist Africa in its struggle to achieve durable peace\r\nand especially to acquire higher levels of development.\r\nThe struggle to reduce poverty has to stand at the\r\nforefront of our joint endeavours. Debt relief and\r\nmarket access are crucial elements of the economic\r\ndevelopment of developing countries. The United\r\nNations must continue with its activities to promote\r\nsustainable development and continue its programmes\r\naimed at providing basic health care and education,\r\nfighting the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and averting the\r\ndevastation of the environment. A gender perspective\r\nshould be included in all these efforts. The gap\r\nbetween the rich and poor countries continues to grow\r\nand is further exacerbated by the imbalance in the\r\ndistribution of globalization benefits. The digital divide\r\nis just an additional symptom of the growing disparity\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries. The\r\nUnited Nations, in cooperation with national\r\ngovernments, the Bretton Woods institutions, the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), the private sector, the non-\r\ngovernmental sphere and civil society, must be\r\nprepared to address the challenges of globalization. In\r\nshort, we should respond to the globalization of capital\r\nby the globalization of solidarity and social justice.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nWe need to create a functioning international\r\nlegal environment in order to prosecute crimes against\r\nhumanity. The Czech Republic fully supports the entry\r\ninto force of the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court, an institution that I believe will be a\r\ngreat asset for the maintenance of international law.\r\nThe protection of human rights will continue to shape\r\nthe fate of human society. Human rights are universal\r\nand indivisible, and it is in the interests of United\r\nNations Member States to support their Organization in\r\nits strenuous effort to secure the protection of human\r\nrights in today’s globally interconnected world. We\r\nmust not remain indifferent to manifestations of\r\nracism, xenophobia, religious or political persecution,\r\ndiscrimination against minorities, violence against\r\nwomen or the violation of the rights of the child,\r\nregardless of where they take place. In this regard\r\nallow me to mention the World Conference in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa. However difficult the negotiations have\r\nshown themselves to be, they point to the fact that\r\nextreme intolerance and terrorism are closely\r\ninterlinked.\r\nThe implementation of United Nations reform is\r\nimperative in order to make the work of our\r\nOrganization more effective. As I said at the beginning\r\nof my statement, as a candidate for the presidency of\r\nthe fifty-seventh session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly, I fully support the reaffirmation of the\r\ncentral role of the General Assembly, the revitalization\r\nof its work, and improvement of its procedural\r\nmethods. Equally, the reform of the Security Council,\r\nincluding its enlargement in the categories of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members and limitation\r\nof the veto, would enhance the authority of that body.\r\nA re-evaluation of the application of the sanctions\r\nmechanism must also play an important part in the\r\nCouncil’s work. The United Nations, more than any\r\nother international forum, is where people of all\r\ncultures and religions meet. We come here from\r\nvarious parts of our planet to solve the problems of\r\ntoday’s world. Despite our different backgrounds we\r\ngather here to approach the problems that face us\r\nbound by the universal human values that unite us. The\r\nhighest of them all is the value of human life. We have\r\nbeen tragically reminded that we need to promote the\r\nculture of peace and to build an environment in which\r\nthe principles of these universally shared values will\r\ntake root. Now more than ever we must strive to\r\novercome our differences and be guided by our\r\ncommon interests. Let us unite our efforts and ensure\r\nthat our work during this session of the General\r\nAssembly contributes to a better, safer and more just\r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ninvite His Excellency Mr. Hugo Tolentino Dipp,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican\r\nRepublic, to address the Assembly.\r\nBefore listening to His Excellency, allow me to\r\nexpress, I think quite legitimately, the feelings of one\r\nand all gathered here. On behalf of all those gathered\r\nhere at this General Assembly session, on our own\r\npersonal behalf and on behalf of our Governments, I\r\noffer our most sincere condolences at the loss of many\r\nof your fellow citizens as well as the nationals of other\r\ncountries as a way of expressing our solidarity, our\r\nappreciation and our deep sympathy for our fellow\r\nhuman beings. With these words, allow me to express\r\nour deepest grief and, once again, our deepest\r\nsolidarity with the people and Government of the\r\nDominican Republic.\r\nMr. Dipp (Dominican Republic) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I address this General Assembly grief-\r\nstricken at the death of 260 people in the tragic\r\naviation accident yesterday in this city of New York.\r\nMost of the individuals stricken were, like myself, of\r\nDominican nationality. Our profound appreciation goes\r\nto the heads of State and Government, to Ministers and\r\nto representatives who have expressed their\r\ncondolences to the people and Government of the\r\nDominican Republic at this tragedy. I am much obliged\r\nto you, Sir.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Dominican\r\nRepublic I offer our congratulations to the President on\r\nhis election to the stewardship of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, convinced as we are that he will\r\nindeed succeed in guiding this session in the very best\r\ninterests, and for the good, of the international\r\ncommunity. Likewise, we offer our most heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, on his having been awarded the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize. That honour, together with that bestowed upon\r\nthe United Nations, proves and ratifies the confidence\r\nand recognition felt for the work being done by the\r\ninternational community represented in this\r\nOrganization on behalf of all mankind.\r\nDespite the fact that in September this year — on\r\nthe heels of the events of 11 September in New York\r\nand in Washington, D.C. — the United Nations devoted\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\na number of plenary meetings to the issue of terrorism,\r\nit is still today impossible for us to separate this from\r\nthe other items that we must deal with on the agenda of\r\nthis session. The significance of these tragic\r\ndevelopments is of such magnitude that it is imperative\r\nfor us, as a matter of conscience, to stop and think in\r\ngreater depth about their complexity and their\r\nrepercussions on the history that it is our lot to have to\r\nlive through, and about the most relevant ways for us\r\nto prevent and combat this scourge. That is so because\r\nit is plain to see that in the time that has elapsed\r\nbetween September and these days of November, we\r\nhave managed to go further and into greater depth,\r\ngaining new insights about the terrorist phenomenon.\r\nWe absolutely agree with those who have already\r\nspoken that terrorism cannot be justified in any way,\r\nand that the excuses some would seek to advance to\r\nvalidate these deeds based on the existence of certain\r\neconomic, social, cultural or political situations, are\r\nunacceptable. However paradoxical it may seem to\r\nsome, the conviction has also been stressed that, while\r\nterrorism is unjustifiable and inexcusable, it is in those\r\nvery situations where terrorism finds its breeding\r\ngrounds, where frustrations and lack of prospects can\r\nfan hatred and irrationality, where being shut out and\r\nhaving no hope, being shunted to the sidelines and\r\nsuffering from poverty can incubate and give birth and\r\nimpetus to twisted feelings of indiscriminate and\r\nirrational vengeance.\r\nFaced with the sad reality of the events of 11\r\nSeptember just past, we are absolutely convinced that\r\nthe direction set for us by the Millennium Summit was\r\nthe right one, that is, the path of peace and of\r\nfellowship among people. At that historic gathering the\r\nrationale was analysed and the framework set for\r\naction by the international community to promote\r\nhuman rights, security, disarmament, economic\r\ndevelopment, equality of nations, and the fight against\r\nhunger, poverty, disease, exclusion, social, racial and\r\ngender prejudice, and the abandonment of children, the\r\ndisabled and the elderly. There can be no doubt that\r\nthese are the priority objectives for the prevention of\r\nviolence and crime, that is to say, for the struggle\r\nagainst wars, against genocide and against terrorism.\r\nThe full weight, pain and inhumanity of the\r\nprovocations of 11 September must not divert us from\r\nthe goals that we set for ourselves in the Millennium\r\nSummit Declaration, nor draw us into any\r\ndisproportionate violence. When last month we\r\naddressed this Assembly we stated that the most prized\r\nvirtue, indeed the democratic essence of this\r\nOrganization, that is of the United Nations, is its\r\ncommitment and determination to uphold respect for\r\nhuman rights. It follows that although we know that\r\nterrorism is the antithesis of that virtue, we must not\r\ntherefore act to confront it while failing to live up to\r\nthe obligation to protect those very rights. While acting\r\nin a legitimate reaction of self-defence, we should not\r\nbe overcome by a spirit of retaliation but should rather\r\nseek to apply international law and justice. That is why\r\nthe Dominican Republic cannot ignore the political\r\nmeasures that surely will also contribute to preventing\r\nand combating terrorism. Thus, we must resolutely\r\nsupport Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nadopted on 28 September, and feel ourselves also\r\nbound by earlier resolutions and covenants the United\r\nNations has worked out over time in its fight against\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn 1945 the United Nations Charter highlighted as\r\nits core concern the need to preserve peace. That was\r\nonly to be expected after a war that had brought death\r\nto millions of human beings and had wreaked havoc in\r\nthe life of many nations. The time that has elapsed has\r\nbrought us to the conviction that there is no better way\r\nto preserve peace than to do all that we possibly can to\r\nprevent war. The United Nations is ever more\r\nnecessary to attain that end, because within it we find\r\nthe underpinnings for promoting a healthy and creative\r\nunderstanding among nations. Our fidelity to the\r\nfoundations of the Organization must be backed up by\r\na shared political will leading to actions that prove\r\nirrefutably that we believe in and live up to what we\r\nsay and promise.\r\nThe unanimous adoption of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, inasmuch as it represented a profound\r\ncommitment by the vast majority of the world’s\r\nleaders, amounted to a kind of rebirth and renewal of\r\nthe United Nations in coming to grips with the\r\nproblems and challenges confronting us in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. In that Declaration it was decided to do\r\nall that we could to establish a just and lasting peace in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, and the determination was\r\nreaffirmed to support all efforts aimed at ensuring the\r\nsovereign equality of States, respect for their territorial\r\nintegrity and political independence and the right to\r\nself-determination of peoples that remain under\r\ncolonial domination and foreign occupation.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nThat pledge makes it incumbent upon us to bring\r\nour full moral force to bear and to avail ourselves of all\r\npossibilities afforded us by the machinery of the\r\nOrganization to resolve the conflicts that keep a\r\nnumber of States around the globe in a state of war. We\r\nhave no doubt whatever that the conflict between Israel\r\nand the Palestinian state must come to an end via\r\ncompliance with the multiple resolutions towards that\r\nend that have emanated from the General Assembly,\r\nthus honouring what we agreed upon in that\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMoreover, we set for ourselves the purpose of\r\nspurring forward reform of the United Nations Charter\r\nand respecting the equality of the rights of nations.\r\nRatifying the Millennium Declaration means that there\r\ncan be no delay in turning the Security Council into a\r\nbody that would respond to the historic realities of the\r\npresent world and in establishing a logical set of\r\ndemocratic balances based on those realities. It seems\r\nto us fair for the non-permanent members to participate\r\nin the Security Council via a rotational system that\r\nwould give to all the same opportunity. By the same\r\ntoken, the Dominican Republic believes that it is also a\r\nmatter of equity and historical realism for us to accept\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan as a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. Geopolitical reasons must not override\r\nsituations of fact that have been recognized in bringing\r\nother States into the United Nations.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration the problem of\r\nglobalization was addressed with the following words:\r\n“We recognize that developing countries\r\nand countries with economies in transition face\r\nspecial difficulties in responding to this central\r\nchallenge. Thus, only through broad and\r\nsustained efforts to create a shared future, based\r\nupon our common humanity in all its diversity,\r\ncan globalization be made fully inclusive and\r\nequitable.” (resolution 55/2, para. 5)\r\nAs we speak, a Ministerial Meeting of the countries\r\nmembers of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is\r\nbeing held in Doha, Qatar. Most countries with small\r\neconomies are rightfully calling for the fulfilment of all\r\nthe agreements of the Uruguay Round. We hope that\r\nthey will not be saddled with unbearable new burdens,\r\nthat their calls will be heard and that generous\r\nsolidarity and cooperation will be shown, as well as\r\nunderstanding of the imbalances, differences and\r\nasymmetries in the pace of development when\r\ncomparing rich countries to poor, small ones.\r\nAmong the objectives of the World Trade\r\nOrganization are respect for human rights,\r\nstrengthening democracy and preserving the\r\nenvironment. All that will not be possible if the process\r\nof globalization is not carried out with a sincere and\r\nresolute determination to show understanding and to\r\nprovide cooperation and technical assistance to help\r\nthe majority of the nations on this planet to achieve\r\ndevelopment. How are we to understand the deadlines\r\nset by the World Trade Organization for attaining\r\ncertain economic objectives, in some cases as soon as\r\n2003 and in others 2005, when the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, aware of the inequalities and difficulties\r\nfacing most nations, seeks to redress no sooner than\r\n2015 — and only to a certain degree — the poverty of\r\nmillions upon millions of human beings whose income\r\nis less than $1 a day? We hope that at the conferences\r\nscheduled by the United Nations, such as the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, light can be shed on these problems in\r\nan effective way, yielding equitable measures designed\r\nto reduce the inequalities separating peoples one from\r\nthe other.\r\nAllow me finally to refer to an aspect most\r\nintimately tied to respect for and recognition of human\r\nrights, something that also coincides with the\r\nMillennium Declaration inasmuch as it refers to the\r\ndemands of women and gender equality. Indeed, the\r\nInternational Research and Training Institute for the\r\nAdvancement of Women (INSTRAW), based in the\r\nDominican Republic, is one of the few United Nations\r\ninstitutions located in a developing country, and the\r\nonly international institute devoted to research on and\r\ntraining for the advancement of women. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in his report to the General Assembly\r\npresented in the Third Committee on 17 October 2001,\r\nsaid that, notwithstanding the difficulties and\r\nuncertainties that INSTRAW has encountered in the\r\nlast two years it has managed to obtain the minimum\r\nresources for fulfilling the mandate assigned to it by\r\nthe Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nHe went on to say that inasmuch as the Institute\r\nhas begun to produce tangible results via the\r\ninformation system and contact networks in creating an\r\nawareness of gender issues, perhaps the Assembly\r\nwould wish to adopt a decision on how Institute would\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nbe able to operate productively and cost-effectively\r\nbeyond the year 2001.\r\nLet us not let INSTRAW — that noble institution,\r\na pioneer in the advancement of women, particularly of\r\nwomen in developing countries — perish for lack of\r\nresources. Let us make a consistent and generous\r\ngesture, demonstrating solidarity, so that the General\r\nAssembly will ensure the continued existence of this\r\ninstitution beyond this year of 2001, by allocating in\r\nthe United Nations budget the funds necessary for it to\r\ncontinue to work towards its fruitful humanitarian\r\nends.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before\r\ncalling on the next speaker, I should like to ask\r\nsubsequent speakers to bear in mind the number of\r\nspeakers still to make their statements. I remind\r\nMembers of the fact that 15 minutes has been allotted\r\nto each statement to allow us to complete the\r\nprogramme and speakers’ list within the time allotted.\r\nI now take deep pleasure in calling on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila Jagne,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Gambia.\r\nMr. Jagne (Gambia): On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I should like to present our heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the grieving families following the\r\ntragic plane accident yesterday.\r\nLet me at the outset congratulate Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo on his unanimous election to preside over the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\r\nWith his wealth of experience and wisdom we have no\r\ndoubt that our deliberations will always be crowned\r\nwith success. He may rest assured that in carrying out\r\nthe important mandate entrusted to him, he will not\r\nfind the cooperation of the Gambian delegation\r\nwanting. On behalf of my delegation I should also like\r\nto pay a special tribute to his predecessor for a job well\r\ndone.\r\nAs for our indefatigable Secretary-General, I add\r\nmy voice to those of previous speakers in\r\ncongratulating him, and the United Nations, on\r\nwinning the Nobel Peace Prize. In addition to that, my\r\ndelegation commends him for his effective and\r\ninspiring leadership, in turning the United Nations\r\naround in such a way that much of the hope that was\r\nlost has since been restored. Mr. Secretary-General,\r\nyou deserve our respect and admiration.\r\nThe circumstances in which we are meeting this\r\ntime are far different from previous sessions for\r\nreasons well known to all of us. The terrorist attacks on\r\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11\r\nSeptember took the whole world by surprise because of\r\ntheir cataclysmic proportions. Nothing can ever justify\r\nsuch barbaric acts. Unfortunately, like so many\r\ncountries present here today, we too were bereaved\r\nfollowing the attack on the World Trade Center. I\r\nshould like at this juncture to express profound\r\ngratitude to President George W. Bush for his kind\r\nremarks. The Government and people of the Gambia,\r\nas well as the families concerned, are deeply moved by\r\nthe President’s thoughtfulness. All of this shows that\r\nterrorism has no boundaries and, worse still, it has no\r\nrespect for the sanctity of life. It is incumbent upon all\r\nof us therefore not to offer sanctuary to any terrorists\r\nor their sponsors.\r\nIn the Gambia, His Excellency the President\r\nAlhaji Dr. Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, declared three days\r\nof national mourning and requested all mosques and\r\nchurches to pray for the deceased in solidarity with the\r\nfriendly people of the United States and their\r\nGovernment. While we continue to pray and mourn,\r\nindividually and collectively, we in the Gambia\r\nsubscribe unreservedly to Security Council resolutions\r\n1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), of 12 and 28 September\r\n2001, respectively. Similarly, we welcome the adoption\r\nof the Dakar Declaration on terrorism by the\r\nConference of African Heads of State and Government,\r\nheld in Dakar, Senegal, on 17 October 2001.\r\nHaving said that, I would, however, hasten to\r\npoint out that it is one thing to adopt resolutions and\r\ndeclarations but it is quite another to implement them\r\nfully. It goes without saying that the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism is neither easy nor the business\r\nof a select group of countries alone. Certainly not. This\r\ninternational scourge can only be dealt with effectively\r\nthrough concerted international effort. However, it will\r\nserve no useful purpose to request Member States to\r\nreport on measures taken in the fight against terrorism\r\nwhen the requisite means to do so are not available.\r\nThis will be a long and difficult engagement, but at the\r\nsame time it is not an impossible task. In the process,\r\nno country should be excluded. Consequently, as a first\r\nstep, the Security Council should inquire of Member\r\nStates what they need, at the national level, to equip\r\nthem in the fight against terrorism, especially in terms\r\nof training and logistics. In our view, that is the priority\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nof priorities, because no category of countries can be\r\nconsidered safe unless and until all categories of\r\ncountries are seen to be safe.\r\nLet me mention en passant one very important\r\npoint. The Gambia, where I come from, is\r\npredominantly Muslim, but we do not at all subscribe\r\nto the misleading concept that the struggle against\r\nterrorism is one between Islam and Christianity. For\r\nthat reason we in the Gambia are committed to signing\r\nand ratifying all the relevant United Nations\r\nconventions against terrorism.\r\nAllow me now to dwell a little on some domestic\r\nissues. As was widely reported all over the world, the\r\npresidential elections that were held in the Gambia on\r\n18 October 2001 received the unanimous endorsement\r\nof the entire international community as free, fair and\r\ntransparent. All international observers present in the\r\ncountry expressed the same views. The 1996 elections\r\nwere also free, fair and transparent, but we were given\r\na mere pass. In the 2001 elections we passed with\r\nflying colours. As of right, therefore, we expect our\r\nprincipal partners in development, who were still\r\nsceptical in 1996, now to show the way forward by\r\nembracing the Government and people of the Gambia\r\nin a new spirit of solidarity geared towards a fresh and\r\nreinvigorated partnership. We have kept our part of the\r\nbargain as a nation. We have delivered what was\r\nexpected of us — in fact, we did more and better than\r\nexpected. What happened immediately after the\r\nelection results were announced is ample\r\ndemonstration of political maturity. Let me give a\r\ngraphic illustration of what I am talking about by\r\nborrowing a paragraph or two from His Excellency\r\nPresident Jammeh’s victory statement.\r\n“Fellow Gambians, [...] I would want to\r\nenjoin you all after the celebrations to put the\r\ncampaign and all the euphoria and the differences\r\nand misunderstandings of politics behind us and\r\ncome together as one people to work with my\r\nGovernment, supporters and non-supporters alike,\r\nto further develop this country.”\r\nPresident Jammeh then went on to thank the principal\r\nleaders of the opposition for their courage and maturity\r\ndisplayed in extending their congratulations to him in a\r\ntelephone conversation. The President then said:\r\n“The gesture was indeed most welcome and I\r\nwould want to restate my expectation that with\r\nthe elections now behind us, we would put our\r\ndifferences of political ideology aside and work\r\ntogether as members of the same family to pursue\r\nthe development agenda we in this country have\r\nset for ourselves, in the best interest of our\r\nbeloved people.”\r\nThat indeed was the icing on the cake. It can now\r\nbe proclaimed without any fear of contradiction that\r\nthe Gambia, despite all the odds, is consolidating its\r\nposition among the leading democracies in Africa, and\r\nindeed in the whole world.\r\nMr. Ould Deddach (Mauritania), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nElsewhere on the African continent, while we\r\ncannot claim that the same pattern of free and fair\r\nelections and the rule of law prevail, we can note with\r\nsatisfaction that the signs are encouraging, although a\r\nlot more remains to be done. In neighbouring Sierra\r\nLeone we commend the United Nations Mission in\r\nSierra Leone (UNAMSIL) for what has been achieved\r\nso far. As elections are fast approaching it becomes\r\neven more urgent to accelerate the process of\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration.\r\nThe importance of a regional approach to conflict\r\nresolution cannot be overemphasized. We will have to\r\nsound our own trumpet by commending the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) for the\r\npreponderant role that it has played in the quest for a\r\nlasting solution to the problems in the Mano River\r\narea. With regard to another neighbouring country,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, the Gambia, in its capacity as\r\ncoordinator of the Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau,\r\nwould like to launch an appeal to the donor community\r\nto cooperate closely with the Group with a view to\r\nconvening the long overdue round-table donors’\r\nconference. As stated in the Fall report following a\r\nmission to West Africa some time ago, certain\r\ncountries in transition, such as Guinea-Bissau, need\r\nspecial and urgent attention. I am referring to the\r\nimportant report by Assistant Secretary-General\r\nIbrahima Fall. We are not done with that report yet, for\r\nit raises such serious issues as the regional approach to\r\nconflict resolution.\r\nWe are also following very closely the situation\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is\r\ngratifying to note that the Security Council adopted\r\nresolution 1376 (2001) by which it gave the green light\r\nfor the launching of phase III of the deployment of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC). My\r\ndelegation also encourages the parties concerned to\r\npursue the inter-Congolese dialogue with renewed\r\nvigour and to cooperate with the Facilitator. We are\r\nsaddened, however, by the illegal exploitation of\r\nnatural resources and other forms of wealth in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. There is obviously\r\na direct link between such practices and the\r\nprolongation of the conflict. Still, in the Great Lakes\r\nregion, we pay a special tribute to former President\r\nMandela for his laudable efforts to bring peace to\r\nBurundi. Concerning the situation in Angola, my\r\ndelegation continues to believe that UNITA’s ability to\r\nwage war must be further reduced through tighter\r\nsanctions. In this context we note with satisfaction the\r\nextension of the mandate of the Monitoring\r\nMechanism.\r\nTurning to other parts of the continent, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the decision of the Security\r\nCouncil to terminate the sanctions that were imposed\r\non the Sudan. We are also calling on the Council to\r\nmake a bold move and lift the sanctions imposed on\r\nLibya. The international community demanded that the\r\nLibyan authorities hand over the Lockerbie suspects for\r\ntrial in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. The\r\ninternational community must now honour its\r\nobligations and stop moving the goal-posts.\r\nOutside Africa we also continue to express\r\nconcern about a number of conflict situations.\r\nSeemingly, the most intractable of the lot is the\r\nsituation in the Middle East, and, notably, the\r\nPalestinian problem. There can be no lasting peace in\r\nthe Middle East without resolving the Palestinian\r\nquestion. We in the Gambia have always held the view\r\nthat, while recognizing the right of Israel to exist\r\nwithin secure borders, we also believe that the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions on the Arab-Israeli conflict\r\nshould be implemented, culminating in the creation of\r\nan independent Palestinian state.\r\nIn the situation between Kuwait and Iraq, we in\r\nthe Gambia have always maintained that the\r\ninternational community should, as a matter of\r\nurgency, find ways of alleviating the suffering of the\r\nIraqi people. But at the same time, the Iraqi leadership\r\nmust be accountable for the Kuwaiti prisoners of war\r\nand missing persons. The families of the prisoners of\r\nwar and missing persons have also been suffering for\r\ntoo long and, therefore, we call upon the Iraqi\r\nGovernment to respect and comply with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions in order to achieve peace\r\nand stability in the Gulf region.\r\nIt is an irony that long after the end of the cold\r\nwar, the situation in the Korean peninsula remains\r\nbasically the same. We in the Gambia were, however,\r\nvery much encouraged by the visit to North Korea of\r\nPresident Kim Dae Jung of South Korea in June last\r\nyear. It is only through dialogue and the exchange of\r\nsuch high-level visits that the peaceful unification of\r\nthe Korean peninsula will be achieved.\r\nSimilarly, it is our fervent hope that one day the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan and the People’s\r\nRepublic of China will unite but, as the saying goes, let\r\nus put first things first. As clearly stated by my\r\ndelegation during the meeting of the General\r\nCommittee, the Government of the Gambia would like\r\nto reiterate that the exceptional situation of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan needs to be reconsidered\r\nby this body. Only a few days ago, the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan was admitted to the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO). That is no mean achievement\r\nand, therefore, my delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the Government and the 23\r\nmillion people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. We\r\nin the Gambia have no doubt that they will make\r\nconstructive contributions to the work of the WTO. It\r\nwill be recalled that the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nis now the world’s seventeenth largest economy in\r\nterms of gross national product (GNP) and the fifteenth\r\nmost important trading nation. Considering that the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan possesses the world’s\r\nthird largest foreign reserves, in addition to its strategic\r\nposition as the sixteenth largest foreign direct investor,\r\nit does not make much sense to continue to exclude it\r\nfrom the United Nations. Politics aside, the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan has a lot to offer the international\r\ncommunity. For instance, in the crucial area of\r\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT),\r\nthe real revolution of our times, the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan is in the vanguard. We all know that the\r\nissue of ICT is among the top priorities of the United\r\nNations and we therefore look forward to the special\r\nevent on Tuesday, 20 November, when the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will launch the United Nations Information\r\nand Communication Technologies (ICT) Task Force.\r\nHow will we be able to benefit from the expertise of\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan when it is excluded\r\nfrom the work of the United Nations?\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nThe Republic of China on Taiwan is active in\r\nother important areas as well, especially development\r\ncooperation, by providing experts and through\r\ninternational financial institutions, and, likewise, in the\r\nhumanitarian field by providing disaster relief to\r\ncountries in need. The case of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan is unique. It is exceptional and should be\r\ntreated as such, quite apart from observing the\r\nprinciple of universality.\r\nAnother country which has much to offer the\r\ninternational community is Cuba, ranging from\r\nmedicine to sports. After more than three decades, the\r\nsanctions imposed on Cuba should now be lifted. These\r\nsanctions can no longer be justified; in fact, they are\r\ncounterproductive.\r\nPrior to the tragic events of 11 September, we had\r\nalready identified a number of areas for increased\r\ninternational cooperation within the framework of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Foremost among these is the\r\neradication of poverty. It is made a priority of priorities\r\nin the Millennium Declaration, if not the priority. In the\r\nWorld Development Report 2000-2001 entitled\r\n“Attacking poverty”, the President of the World Bank\r\nin his foreword stated that “Poverty amid plenty is the\r\nworld’s greatest challenge.” We are also of the view\r\nthat poverty constitutes a serious threat to international\r\npeace and security, knowing that 1.2 billion people live\r\non less than $1 a day. That is why our leaders\r\nundertook to cut by half the proportion of people living\r\nin extreme poverty by the year 2015. Of the 1.2 billion\r\nwho live on less than $1 a day, 300 million are in\r\nAfrica. Under these circumstances the New African\r\nInitiative is indeed a timely response. We only hope\r\nthat unlike previous blueprints for Africa’s socio-\r\neconomic development, the New Initiative will not be\r\nleft to gather dust. It would appear for the first time,\r\nthat we, the Africans, are in the driver’s seat. That is a\r\nclear demonstration of ownership and commitment.\r\nOur principal partners in development should also\r\ncomplement our efforts by providing the necessary\r\nresources as a matter of urgency. The Economic\r\nCommission for Africa should work closely with the\r\nvarious regional economic groupings to ensure proper\r\nand effective coordination. We are confident that the\r\nmomentum generated by the adoption of the New\r\nAfrican Initiative will be intensified with the\r\nconvening of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development at the summit level in\r\nMonterrey, Mexico, next year. That Conference will\r\nprovide a unique opportunity for the international\r\ncommunity to translate into reality the global solidarity\r\nspelled out in the Millennium Declaration, especially in\r\nsuch vital areas as official development assistance\r\n(ODA), foreign direct investment (FDI) and debt\r\nreduction, or outright cancellation in some cases, and\r\nmarket access — to mention only a few.\r\nSimilarly, the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment (Rio+10), to be held in South Africa next\r\nyear, will also provide a golden opportunity for\r\nstocktaking, notably for a comprehensive review of the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21.\r\nAll efforts geared towards the eradication of\r\npoverty would be incomplete without addressing the\r\nissue of food security. My delegation therefore looks\r\nforward to the convening of the World Food Summit in\r\nJune next year. A related issue is health. We in West\r\nAfrica, particularly we in the Gambia, would like to\r\neradicate malaria as a matter of urgency and, as a first\r\nstep, our leaders have adopted the Rollback Malaria\r\nProgramme. We will need the support and solidarity of\r\nthe entire international community in this endeavour,\r\nespecially within the context of the Global Alliance for\r\nVaccines and Immunization.\r\nWith special reference to the least developed\r\ncountries, it will be recalled that the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries,\r\nheld recently, adopted yet another Programme of\r\nAction for the decade 2001-2010 aimed essentially at\r\nthe eradication of poverty. We hope that the rest of the\r\ndonor community will support that Programme fully by\r\nmaking available the resources necessary for its\r\nimplementation. In any poverty eradication\r\nprogramme, the most vulnerable groups, that is, women\r\nand children, should be given special attention. That is\r\nwhy the Government of the Gambia remains committed\r\nto the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,\r\nincluding the further actions and initiatives that\r\nemanated from the Beijing+5 Conference held last\r\nJune. The same applies to the Nairobi forward-looking\r\nstrategies for the advancement of women and all other\r\ninitiatives that promote the advancement of women and\r\nthe girl child. In fact, His Excellency President Yahya\r\nJammeh has now decided that all girls in the Gambia\r\nfrom grades 1 to 12, in virtually all parts of the\r\ncountry, will no longer pay school fees.\r\nFinally, experience has shown that our collective\r\nsecurity can only be guaranteed if and when all\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nmembers of the comity of nations are equally\r\nguaranteed freedom from want and freedom from fear.\r\nThat can be achieved only through genuine\r\ninternational solidarity. The tendency to look the other\r\nway when another needs a helping hand should be a\r\nthing of the past. Each time in our history when we are\r\nfaced with major difficulties, we suddenly realize how\r\nmuch we need one another. We close our ranks and\r\ntake up the challenges together. We are again at a\r\ncrossroads. That is why we are all here to renew faith\r\nin multilateralism. There is no alternative to the United\r\nNations. We are now strengthened in our conviction\r\nthat our Organization is nowhere near being a “sunset”\r\nOrganization. It is a “sunrise” Organization. But it\r\nshould shine even brighter once the Security Council is\r\nreformed to reflect the realities of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Unless that is done, the Security Council runs\r\nthe serious risk of becoming irrelevant because it is\r\nanchored in the past. We do not want that to happen. It\r\nis too vital an organ to be sidelined, but it must adapt\r\nand adjust. It is time to move on. Let us be forward-\r\nlooking. Whatever the outcome may be, Africa must be\r\nadequately represented.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. János Martonyi, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Hungary.\r\nMr. Martonyi (Hungary) (spoke in French):\r\nFirst, may I congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his\r\nelection to preside over the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I assure him that he has the\r\nHungarian delegation’s full support in the effective\r\nfulfilment of his tasks and high responsibility. At the\r\nsame time, I wish to thank Mr. Harri Holkeri for the\r\nmuch appreciated work that he carried out in his\r\ncapacity as President of the preceding session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nSixty-three days have elapsed since 11\r\nSeptember. More than 80 nations are in mourning\r\ntoday, mourning the absurd deaths of their compatriots,\r\nmen and women from all over the world and\r\nrepresenting different and various traditions, cultures,\r\nbeliefs and ethnic origins. Approximately 6,000 people\r\nperished as a result of heinous terrorist attacks in New\r\nYork, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania, and we\r\nremember the victims in our prayers and extend our\r\ndeep sympathy and compassion to their families and\r\nfriends.\r\nThese attacks were committed against the entire\r\ncivilized world and against fundamental human values.\r\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly very\r\nquickly took firm and clear measures in order to defend\r\nthe universal interests of the international community.\r\nTo this end, an effective global coalition was created in\r\nwhich Hungary, side by side with many other countries,\r\nis proudly participating. Those who perpetrated and\r\nsupported these terrorist attacks are trying to depict\r\ntheir acts, as well as the reaction of legitimate self-\r\ndefence to those acts, as a war of religion. Clearly it is\r\nnothing of the sort. There can be no justification for\r\nthese acts, nor for any other terrorist activities\r\nanywhere else. In fact, international terrorism pursues\r\npolitical objectives and is trying to undermine our\r\nmulti-ethnic and multi-concessional world, to\r\nexacerbate regional conflict, to pit various cultures one\r\nagainst another and to impose on us by force its own\r\norder of hatred and fanaticism. The nature of the\r\nchallenge with which we are confronted is eminently\r\nstrategic: first, because it calls into question the raison\r\nd’être and endangers the very existence of our\r\ncivilization; secondly, because the terrorist network,\r\nwhich is organizing against us, has managed to develop\r\nglobal capacities; and, lastly, because in the war that is\r\ndeclared against us, terrorism abides by no legal order\r\nand follows no rules.\r\nWe can welcome the fact that, on the basis of a\r\nconvergence of interests, cooperation among States has\r\nacquired, in the two months following the terrible\r\nevent, a dimension that is very promising and entirely\r\nnew. But major combat against international terrorism\r\nwill certainly not be short. Of course the military\r\naction launched against the Taliban regime and the\r\nterrorist Al Qaeda organization represent an important\r\nelement, but not the only one, within the framework of\r\ninternational action. Within this struggle, the tasks that\r\nwe have to carry out are complex and multifaceted. We\r\nhave to do our utmost in the political, diplomatic,\r\neducational, legal, and also financial, humanitarian,\r\neconomic and social areas to make sure that we, in the\r\nfinal analysis, emerge victorious from this struggle. We\r\nmust recognize that in this struggle we have to\r\nredouble our efforts to promote the rule of law, to\r\nreject extremism, intolerance, discrimination and\r\nnationalistic tendencies and to intensify the global\r\nwork that has to be accomplished in order to eradicate\r\npoverty and ensure sustainable development. The fight\r\nagainst terrorism is part and parcel of the general\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nframework of this global endeavour within which we\r\nare trying to build a better world.\r\nThe terrorist attacks against the United States will\r\nprobably be remembered as a turning point in our\r\nhistory, and also an opening to a new era. What is\r\ncertain is that from now on humanity will not be able\r\nto continue in the same way as before. Governments\r\nhave to shoulder major responsibility vis-à-vis this\r\nchallenge, which now touches directly upon our\r\neveryday existence. The international community\r\nmanaged to find the most appropriate response by\r\nbringing together a coalition unprecedented in inter-\r\nState relations, the historic importance of which will\r\ncertainly go far beyond our own era. Hungary stands\r\nready, within the limit of its capacity, to take an active\r\npart in that coalition.\r\nIn the present situation, the United Nations is\r\ncalled upon to play a role of primary importance, to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of international action.\r\nThrough the development of 12 anti-terrorist\r\nconventions, the United Nations has already\r\ncontributed very significantly towards the development\r\nof a common framework of international law in the\r\nfight against terrorism. Through the adoption of other\r\nconventions, which are now being prepared, the legal\r\nframework will become even more comprehensive and\r\ngeneral. However, in order to do that, we must make\r\nnew efforts and, given the importance of what is at\r\nstake, and the fact that we have common goals, the\r\ngroups of countries concerned should display a greater\r\ndegree of flexibility. The United Nations should be able\r\nfully to play its role of enhancing the practical\r\nimplementation of international anti-terrorist\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn the wake of the terrorist attacks, a series of\r\nspecific measures were implemented by my country’s\r\nGovernment. At the international level we have\r\nstrengthened our cooperation, both political and legal,\r\nin the anti-terrorist area with our allies at NATO and\r\nour partners within the European Union (EU). We\r\ndecided also to implement Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), and we will forward to the Committee\r\nthat was established under the terms of that resolution a\r\ndetailed report on the national measures undertaken by\r\nHungary to fight terrorism. I should like to recall at\r\nthis stage that Hungary is a party to most of the\r\ninternational, multilateral conventions against\r\nterrorism.\r\nAs regards the two most recently passed United\r\nNations conventions in this area, let me state that my\r\ncountry has just deposited today with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral the instrument of ratification for the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\r\nTerrorist Bombings. I should like to announce that\r\nHungary will sign the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism in the\r\nupcoming weeks. We are determined to become a party\r\nto that Convention as quickly as possible, so as to\r\ncomplement the Hungarian participation in\r\ninternational conventions that are universal in nature\r\nand deal with the fight against terrorism. Furthermore,\r\nmy Government recently submitted to Parliament a\r\ndraft law to strengthen national regulations in the areas\r\nof money-laundering and fighting terrorism.\r\nHungary attaches very special importance to the\r\nsuccess of the international humanitarian action in\r\nAfghanistan. Through the two Hungarian humanitarian\r\norganizations, which traditionally have played a role in\r\nthe region, my Government has started to forward\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the refugees and the Afghan\r\npopulation. Such assistance consists of foodstuffs and\r\nblankets for about 15,000 people.\r\nMy Government is very deeply concerned at the\r\ndanger represented by the proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction and their means of delivery. Our\r\ncommitment in favour of multilateral control over such\r\nweapons remains unchanged and we participate in\r\ninternational efforts aimed at limiting and eliminating\r\nweapons of mass destruction. The tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember and the recent anthrax-related incidents\r\nmake us realize the possible dramatic consequences of\r\nthe absence of a reaction by the community of nations\r\nto the challenge presented by weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, including biological weapons. We think\r\nthat the strengthening of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production and\r\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin\r\nWeapons and on Their Destruction will enable the\r\ninternational community to act even more effectively\r\nagainst the intent to use biological agents for military\r\nobjectives. The ad hoc group asked to work out\r\nmeasures for implementation managed to make notable\r\nprogress in the almost seven years of its history, and is\r\nvery near agreement. We regret that it could not\r\nfinalize its work before the date of the Fifth Review\r\nConference of the Convention. It is important that the\r\nConference should leave aside the divergence of views\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nwith regard to the approach to the modalities of the\r\nlong-term strengthening of the Convention, and that\r\ninstead it should underscore the commitment\r\nundertaken by Member States to promote the integrity\r\nof the system of the prohibition of biological weapons.\r\nIn its capacity as Chair of the Fifth Review\r\nConference, Hungary would like to do its utmost in\r\norder to justify the hopes expressed by Member States\r\nand public opinion that specific results will emerge\r\nfrom the Conference. We would like actively to\r\ncontribute to making sure that efforts aimed at\r\nstrengthening the system of prohibition of biological\r\nweapons will also continue without interruption after\r\nthe Conference.\r\nThe Statute of the International Criminal Court is\r\na political and legal document of capital importance. It\r\ntranslates into fact the historic aspiration we have had\r\nthat those who commit the crimes of genocide, war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity will not be allowed\r\nin future to act with impunity. Therefore, we warmly\r\nwelcome the ratification of the Rome Statute by a\r\nrapidly growing number of countries, to date\r\nnumbering more than 40. Within this context I wish to\r\nannounce here that the Hungarian Parliament, by a\r\nresolution that was adopted almost unanimously,\r\nratified the Statute on 6 November. The deposition of\r\nthe instrument of ratification will take place in the\r\ncourse of this month of November.\r\nHungary is working actively so as to ensure that\r\nthe Court, this very important institution of our era, can\r\nstart working in the near future. We should also make\r\nefforts to ensure that it will be universally accepted as\r\nsoon as possible because only in that way will it be\r\nable to be successful in its work and effective in the\r\narea of maintaining peace and international security\r\nand effectively protecting international humanitarian\r\nlaw and human rights.\r\nOur world has changed and we all have to change\r\nwith it. Unfortunately, when I say that I am not saying\r\nthat earlier challenges have disappeared but rather that,\r\nin addition to the difficulties we already have, we are\r\nfacing a new crisis that compels us to think\r\nstrategically and at the same time be very resolute in\r\nour action. The work that we have to carry out is\r\ntherefore wider and broader and the only choice we\r\nhave is to act on the basis of our human values in the\r\ninterests of our civilization and future security. The\r\nUnited Nations is part and parcel of that endeavour.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration speaks of it with great\r\neloquence and the events of 11 September only\r\nstrengthen the message contained therein by\r\nunderscoring the crucial nature of the times we live in,\r\na crossroads between two centuries and two millennia.\r\nWe are asked to provide answers to the global\r\nquestions that haunt us and that have been continuously\r\nplaguing this world. The success or failure of our\r\nefforts to provide such answers will, without any\r\ndoubt, affect the quality of life of the whole of the\r\ntwenty-first century. It is in this spirit that my\r\ndelegation wishes to provide its contribution to the\r\nsuccess of the deliberations, held under the very special\r\ncircumstances of the present session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Ernst Walch, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Liechtenstein.\r\nMr. Walch (Liechtenstein): Let me first join\r\nprevious speakers in expressing our heartfelt\r\nsympathies to the host country and to the bereaved\r\nfamilies for the loss of their loved ones in yesterday’s\r\ndisaster.\r\nEver since 11 September, the fight against\r\nterrorism in all its forms has rightfully been at the top\r\nof the agenda of the United Nations and of other\r\ninternational organizations. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Liechtenstein, I wish to pledge our full\r\nsupport for international cooperation to combat\r\nterrorism. A quick understanding has emerged that\r\nmultilateralism and international cooperation are the\r\nonly ways to successfully tackle the challenges we are\r\nfacing. Once again, the world has looked to the United\r\nNations for leadership in our common fight, and once\r\nagain the United Nations has delivered. We wish to pay\r\ntribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He has\r\nnavigated this Organization in a most clever, capable\r\nand visionary manner through turbulent times and\r\nassiduously enhanced its standing in the international\r\narena. Right before the beginning of his second term as\r\nSecretary-General the United Nations is a stronger and\r\nmore credible organization than ever. I wish to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General, and indeed the\r\nentire Organization he heads, on being awarded the\r\nNobel Peace Prize. No one could be better placed to be\r\na voice of international legitimacy and to provide\r\nleadership during the times ahead — and this is a\r\nmoment when leadership is most needed.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nBoth the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil have reacted with resolve and determination to\r\nthe attacks of 11 September. The Council took a bold\r\nstep in adopting its ground-breaking resolution 1373\r\n(2001). We are indeed facing a new type of crisis and\r\nthe Security Council has designed a new type of\r\nresponse. The delegation of Liechtenstein looks\r\nforward to working closely with the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee to fully implement the provisions of that\r\nresolution. Given the novelty of the task, we appreciate\r\nthe difficulties and enormous workload the Committee\r\nis facing. We also express our support for the\r\ntransparent manner and the spirit of cooperation and\r\ndialogue which the Committee has displayed thus far in\r\ncarrying out its work. Benchmarking and best practices\r\nare of the utmost importance in this context. High\r\nstandards of enforcement have to be developed and to\r\nbe applied uniformly to all actors, be they\r\nGovernments, banks, intermediaries, fiduciaries or\r\nattorneys. We are committed to implementing\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) as a whole, but will place\r\nparticular emphasis on its central aspects relating to the\r\nfinancing of terrorism. We have all the necessary\r\ninstruments in place to make our contribution to\r\nsuppress and prevent the financing of terrorism.\r\nConsequently, I signed on behalf of Liechtenstein the\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism on 2 October this year. Our common effort\r\ncan only be successful if it is focused on our true goal\r\nof stopping financial flows to terrorists and their\r\norganizations. We must not, however, venture into\r\nother areas of international financing under the guise of\r\nfighting terrorism. In this context I wish to state very\r\nclearly that bank secrecy as practised in Liechtenstein\r\nnever has provided and never will provide protection to\r\nterrorists or their financial transactions.\r\nIf the fight against terrorism is to be a genuinely\r\ncommon effort, it must include all of us. The General\r\nAssembly, as the only all-inclusive organ of the United\r\nNations, must therefore play a significant role in our\r\nefforts. We trust that the General Assembly will assert\r\nits rightful place as the law-making body of the United\r\nNations by adopting a comprehensive convention\r\nagainst terrorism to fill the gaps in the existing\r\nframework of international law dealing with specific\r\naspects of terrorism.\r\nThe fight against terrorism is multifaceted and the\r\nrole of the United Nations must also cover a wide\r\nrange of topics, including what is often referred to as\r\nthe root causes of terrorism. Indeed, isolating the\r\nextremists, exposing the perversity of their agenda, and\r\nthus preventing more misguided and disenfranchised\r\npeople from joining a cause of insanity, is the only way\r\nour fight will be successful in the long term. Poverty,\r\nsocial exclusion and marginalization, and the lack of\r\nbasic education are key areas we must address. These\r\nare, of course, by no means new topics on the agenda\r\nof the United Nations, but we need to do more and we\r\nneed to do better. Informed and educated policy\r\nchanges are not concessions to the evil of terrorism.\r\nSuch thinking would lead to paralysis and inaction. It\r\nis of crucial importance that the spirit of international\r\ncooperation, rather than being selective and short-lived,\r\nshould prevail in our work on these essential issues.\r\nThe United Nations is further challenged on the\r\ncomplex relationship between terrorism and human\r\nrights. The promotion and protection of human rights\r\nmust not fall victim to the fight against terrorism.\r\nHuman rights are not a luxury that we can afford\r\nduring good times and dispense with in times of crisis.\r\nRather, they are the foundation upon which all our\r\nactivities must be based. Curtailing the existing human\r\nrights standards in the name of the fight against\r\nterrorism would mean giving up our most fundamental\r\nvalues — the very values that those who commit\r\nterrorist attacks are out to destroy. This we must not\r\nallow to happen. The World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance was concluded on 8 September. I\r\nhad the honour to attend that event in my capacity as\r\nChairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council\r\nof Europe, which served as the regional preparatory\r\nbody for the Conference. After a most difficult and\r\ncomplex process, the Conference was brought to a\r\nsuccessful end with probably the best achievable\r\noutcome — the resolution of issues of both the past and\r\nthe present, and a global anti-discrimination agenda\r\nwithin which we all can work.\r\nThe difficulties of the Durban Conference are\r\nreflected in the still ongoing debate on remaining\r\ntechnical, but important, details. The necessary\r\npolitical will should be mustered as soon as possible so\r\nthat the message from Durban can reach people\r\nworldwide. The events of 11 September have given\r\nadditional significance to this message, since racism\r\nand intolerance can be both cause and consequence of\r\nterrorism. One of our most difficult new challenges in\r\nour fight against racism is to prevent discrimination\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nagainst people because of their affiliation with certain\r\nethnic groups.\r\nThere are those who interpret the events of 11\r\nSeptember as a fulfilment of a predicted clash of\r\ncivilizations. They are wrong. Those who committed\r\nthe attacks do not represent a civilization or religion;\r\nthey believe only in terror, violence and destruction.\r\nThey are just criminals. Their acts were not an attack\r\non a civilization; they were an attack on, and a crime\r\nagainst, humanity. But, of course, nothing would serve\r\ntheir intentions better than a clash of civilizations. The\r\nUnited Nations is therefore challenged to prevent such\r\na clash. The International Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations serves as a useful reminder of what the\r\nUnited Nations has always stood for.\r\nTerrorism cannot be fought only with military\r\nmeasures and international judicial cooperation. Only\r\nby going beyond these obvious measures can we be\r\nsuccessful in the long term. We must change the\r\ncollective conscience and awareness of all societies\r\nand teach our children the futility and the dangers of\r\nresorting to violence as a means of dealing with\r\nconflicts. Terrorists utilize the most extreme forms of\r\nviolence. Therefore, they must be effectively excluded\r\nfrom society. They must be outlawed. It must be\r\nunacceptable for terrorists to establish themselves as\r\npolitical players by resorting to violence and by\r\nindiscriminately attacking civilians.\r\nThis unified stance against terrorism must, in\r\nturn, be accompanied by our willingness to engage in a\r\npeaceful dialogue with those who advocate legitimate\r\npolitical causes, difficult as that may seem. Only by\r\nensuring that communities and entities are not\r\noppressed, and that they are given room to voice their\r\nconcerns, can we eventually eradicate terrorism. In this\r\ncontext it is important that the international community\r\ndevelop mechanisms that allow for such a dialogue to\r\ntake place, based on an agreed framework and existing\r\nstandards of international law. We must not accept\r\nterrorism as a fact of life, but believe in our collective\r\nability to eradicate it. That goal may seem distant or\r\neven unrealistic, but so did the goal of eradicating\r\nslavery in the nineteenth century and fascism in the\r\ntwentieth century. It is now up to all of us to free\r\nourselves from terrorism, the scourge of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Thérence Sinunguruza,\r\nMinister for External Relations and Cooperation of\r\nBurundi.\r\nMr. Sinunguruza (Burundi) (spoke in French): It\r\nis for me a signal honour to take the floor today before\r\nthe Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, I wish at the outset to express my sincere\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic\r\nof Korea on his well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of this body of the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve that his vast experience, his dynamism and his\r\ncompetence guarantee the success of our work at this\r\nsession. He can count on my delegation to be fully\r\navailable to him. We will spare no effort to facilitate\r\nhis work so that his noble mission can be carried out to\r\nthe fullest.\r\nAllow me next to pay sincere tribute to Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri for the way he acquitted himself in his term of\r\noffice leading the work at our last session. We all\r\nappreciated his many talents as a statesman and\r\nseasoned diplomat, which in large measure contributed\r\nto bringing the work of that session to a successful\r\nconclusion.\r\nI should like, finally, to avail myself of this\r\nfelicitous opportunity to convey the greetings of the\r\nBurundian people to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations, and to express to him\r\nonce again my heartfelt congratulations on his\r\nunanimous re-election to the helm of the Organization\r\nfor a second term of office. At the same time, I address\r\nto him my warmest congratulations on the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize just awarded to him and to the United Nations\r\nitself. This token of renewed confidence is a striking\r\nexpression of recognition of the United Nations\r\nfamily’s tireless efforts in every corner of the world for\r\nthe cause of peace and development. My Government\r\nis particularly obliged to the Secretary-General for his\r\npersonal commitment to helping the people of Burundi\r\nemerge from crisis so that through the ongoing peace\r\nprocess they can resume the path of peace,\r\nreconciliation and development.\r\nAll of us were shocked and horrified by the\r\nmurderous attacks perpetrated here in New York,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11 September\r\n2001. My Government firmly condemned those odious\r\nterrorist acts, characterized by indescribable barbarity.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Burundi, Mr. Pierre\r\nBuyoya, dispatched a message of condolence to\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nPresident George W. Bush immediately after the tragic\r\nevents had been reported.\r\nThe events of 11 September 2001 mark a new\r\nglobal challenge for the United Nations in its resolute\r\nfight against terrorism and for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. The Government of\r\nthe Republic of Burundi fully subscribes to the relevant\r\nresolutions of the United Nations on the fight against\r\nterrorism. Committed to the ideals of peace and\r\nsecurity the world over, it intends to make its own\r\ncontribution to building a world from which\r\ninternational terrorism will be banished. Towards that\r\nend, Burundi endorses the various international\r\nconventions against international terrorism. It has\r\nalready ratified three of them, and this morning we\r\nsigned the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted in\r\n1999. The necessary steps will be taken to sign and\r\nratify the remaining conventions. Burundi hails the\r\nadoption by the Security Council of its resolution 1373\r\n(2001) and stands committed to examining in depth its\r\nscope of application on our own national territory.\r\nIn light of the plethora of sophisticated juridical\r\nprovisions — extant for nearly 30 years now — to fight\r\nagainst this scourge, a profound awareness and far\r\nmore sustained collective action today is imperative.\r\nThe Government of Burundi agrees with the content of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), which\r\nemphasizes:\r\n“... the need to enhance coordination of efforts on\r\nnational, subregional, regional and international\r\nlevels in order to strengthen a global response to\r\nthis serious challenge and threat to international\r\nsecurity” (S/RES/1373 (2001), op. para. 4).\r\nThat global response obviously, and as a matter of\r\npriority, is an imperative for us, the Members of this\r\ninstitution, the United Nations, on which the Charter\r\nexplicitly confers the role of maintaining international\r\npeace and security.\r\nAs to the situation in my own country, Burundi,\r\nthe present session is being held at a time when the\r\npeace process has just completed a particularly\r\ndecisive phase. Indeed the Arusha Peace Accord,\r\nwhich Burundi signed on 28 August 2000, has begun to\r\nbe resolutely implemented. May I be allowed to bring\r\nto the attention of the distinguished representatives\r\ngathered here certain major developments worthy of\r\nbeing emphasized. After a number of consultations\r\nheld among the signatories to the Peace Agreement,\r\nand after the Facilitation and Regional Initiative, the\r\nmatter of the transitional leadership for the next three\r\nyears has been settled. On 1 November 2001, the\r\nsolemn inauguration of the President and Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic and the transitional\r\nGovernment was held.\r\nI wish to make a point of expressing the very\r\nsincere thanks of the Government and people of\r\nBurundi to the heads of State and other eminent\r\npersonalities that elevated those ceremonies by their\r\npresence.\r\nAt this important stage in the peace process, I\r\nshould like to take care of a pleasant duty, namely that\r\nof paying tribute first to the late Mwalimu Julius\r\nNyerere, who was the first to play a mediator’s role in\r\nthe inter-Burundian peace process in an extremely\r\ndelicate setting. Secondly, I wish to make it a point\r\nsolemnly to hail the courage, vision, perseverance and\r\ntact that His Excellency the former President Nelson\r\nMandela displayed throughout the inter-Burundian\r\nnegotiations so as to help the Burundian people regain\r\nthe path to peace, reconciliation and democracy. From\r\nthis lofty tribune I wish to express to him our feelings\r\nof profound gratitude. We feel the same sentiments of\r\nsincere appreciation to the United Nations and all\r\ncountries and personalities that have worked from near\r\nor afar to see to the signing of the Peace Accord,\r\npeople who continue to invest of themselves in order to\r\nsee the Agreement fully implemented. It is thanks to all\r\nthese pooled efforts that some glimmer of hope is\r\nperceptible in the Burundian political skies.\r\nThe new Government has set itself as a priority\r\ntask halting the war, rehabilitating victims and\r\nrestoring the country in socio-economic terms.\r\nNotwithstanding, however, our firm determination to\r\nmove forward, the programme continues to encounter\r\nenormous challenges, challenges such as the\r\npersistence of war and the exacerbation of poverty.\r\nWith regard to the war, we must deplore the fact that\r\narmed groups continue to sow grief and desolation in\r\nvarious parts of the country, pursuing a nameless war, a\r\nwar that is killing innocents in their homes, in the\r\ncamps for displaced persons and along the roads, a war\r\nthat favours pillaging and rape and that has destroyed\r\nsocial and economic infrastructures built at great cost.\r\nWe denounce and condemn in the strongest terms this\r\nnew type of violence, namely the seizing of school\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nchildren by rebel elements to press-gang them into\r\nguerrilla forces or to have them do their dirty deeds.\r\nIn this context the priority of all priorities for my\r\ncountry thus remains the quest for a ceasefire, which\r\nwould make it possible to begin the major reforms\r\nenvisaged during the transitional period.\r\nNotwithstanding numerous initiatives directed by our\r\nGovernment towards the armed groups — the Conseil\r\nnational pour la défense de démocratie-Forces pour la\r\ndéfense de démocratie (CNDD-FDD), and the Forces\r\nnationales de la libération (FNL) — inviting them to\r\nsubscribe to the peace process and join in negotiations,\r\nas yet there is no sign of a firm, formal commitment on\r\ntheir part that would allow us to move forward in that\r\ndirection. Nonetheless we feel that these armed groups\r\nno longer have political claims that they can truly\r\nbrandish, given the fact that the Arusha Accords\r\nenvisage their participation in transitional institutions,\r\ntheir recruitment into defence and security corps and\r\ntheir social and professional reintegration if they so\r\ndesire.\r\nWhile thanking our partners for the variety of\r\ninitiatives already launched to bring the Burundian\r\nrebels into the peace process, I should like once again\r\nto call upon all the countries members of the Regional\r\nInitiative, the Facilitation in the inter-Burundian\r\nnegotiations, the Organization of African Unity, the\r\nUnited Nations, and the rest of the international\r\ncommunity to continue to bring pressure to bear upon\r\nthese armed groups so that they will lay down their\r\narms and rejoin other Burundians around the\r\nnegotiating table without further delay, in conformity\r\nwith Security Council resolution 1375 (2001), adopted\r\non 29 October 2001, and other resolutions of the\r\nCouncil. We particularly ask for the invaluable help of\r\nthe countries in our subregion, all of them co-\r\nsignatories to the Arusha Accords, so that all the\r\nnecessary steps will be taken to stop these armed\r\ngroups from attacking Burundi. Notwithstanding these\r\nvarious initiatives, if the rebels continue obstinately to\r\nrefuse dialogue, my Government will call upon the\r\ninternational community and all parties signatories to\r\nthe Arusha Accords to do all they possibly can to\r\nneutralize and disarm the FDD and FNL and, at the\r\nsame time, the other negative forces allied to them.\r\nThe continuing deterioration in the socio-\r\neconomic situation in my country constitutes yet\r\nanother source of major concern for the new\r\ngovernment team. Indeed, eight years of the worst kind\r\nof fratricidal war, together with three years of\r\nunjustified economic embargo, from July 1996 to\r\nJanuary 1999, have plunged the country into a state of\r\nextreme poverty which will be difficult to overcome.\r\nWhat is more, international cooperation since 1996 has,\r\nas it were, been frozen, thus confronting us with a lack\r\nof foreign exchange and a major erosion of our\r\nmonetary situation. Furthermore, in the year 2000,\r\neconomic activity continued to suffer from the heavy\r\nblows of drought, bringing about negative growth for\r\ntwo consecutive years in an essentially agricultural\r\ncountry.\r\nOver the same crisis period, the situation with\r\nregard to health has significantly deteriorated.\r\nNotwithstanding efforts exerted by my Government,\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases such as those\r\nlinked to malnutrition, continue to rage among our\r\npeople, already weakened by the horrors of war. The\r\nmajor performance indicators for education reflect a\r\nnet decline. Access to drinking water and general\r\nhygiene conditions have seriously deteriorated at a\r\ntime when many of our dwellings and the basic social\r\ninfrastructure, such as schools and health centres, have\r\nbeen destroyed by war.\r\nFaced with a particularly trying situation,\r\nBurundi looks for a great deal from the United Nations\r\nand its agencies, its various bilateral partners,\r\ninternational organizations and non-governmental\r\norganizations to help our economy to recover, in the\r\nname of international solidarity and for the benefit of\r\nour people plunged today into a state of unprecedented\r\npoverty. I thus urgently appeal to my country’s various\r\npartners to make tangible the reality of the promises\r\nmade at the Pledging Conference for Burundi, held in\r\nParis from 11 to 12 December 2000, for the purpose of\r\nrebuilding and helping the recovery of our economy. A\r\nround table following through on these commitments\r\nmade at that Conference is to be organized in Geneva\r\nin December 2001. The Government of Burundi counts\r\non the active participation of our partners, particularly\r\nin making available the aid promised.\r\nOn the international scene the delegation of\r\nBurundi hopes to see the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the Millennium Declaration adopted last\r\nyear by the heads of State and Government of Member\r\nStates of the Organization. It particularly supports the\r\nreforming of the Security Council and welcomes the\r\nfact that this matter already enjoys the broad-ranging\r\nbacking of the Members of the United Nations. It\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nregrets nonetheless that discussions on the modalities\r\nthat the reform is to take are at an impasse, and this,\r\neight years after the establishment of the Working\r\nGroup under General Assembly resolution 48/26,\r\nadopted on 3 December 1993. My delegation,\r\nnotwithstanding all that, remains confident that the\r\nwork of the Working Group concerned will be quickly\r\nconcluded, the results being of the keenest interest in\r\nterms, once again, of galvanizing this major body.\r\nBurundi wishes to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the problems that have grown more and\r\nmore serious and alarming because of the accumulation\r\nand excessive and destabilizing proliferation of small\r\narms and light weapons and the arms race. In this\r\nconnection it is ever more necessary and urgent to\r\ndevelop and effectively implement specific\r\ndisarmament programmes. We welcome the adoption of\r\nthe Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects at the United Nations\r\nConference, held from 9 to 20 July 2001, here in New\r\nYork. Our surest hope is for that Programme to be\r\neffectively implemented to relieve the suffering of\r\npeople in the regions where this kind of weaponry\r\ncontinues to take the lives of thousands of innocent\r\npeople. What is more, the Government of Burundi\r\nremains devoted to the goal of the total elimination of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, whether they be nuclear,\r\nchemical or biological.\r\nTo have peace and security prevail required\r\nadopting a working strategy for conflict prevention,\r\nwith a view to understanding fully the motives and\r\ndynamics of confrontation and to curing this evil at its\r\nroot. It also means resolutely attacking the structural\r\ncauses that drive people to revolt, namely ignorance,\r\nwant, disease, extreme poverty, underdevelopment and\r\nits corollaries, and inequities in the distribution of\r\nwealth. There is a chain directly linking desperate acts\r\nand the fanaticism bred of frustration and humiliation.\r\nThus, the imbalance between the North and the South\r\nis unlikely to promote harmonious equilibrium. Indeed,\r\non the basis of available statistics, more than one third\r\nof mankind lives in absolute poverty. This is liable to\r\ngrow worse if the rich countries continue not to\r\nshoulder their responsibilities in terms of aid for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nImproving the living conditions of people\r\ncontributes, through its induced effects, to reducing\r\nother anachronistic factors growing out of poverty,\r\nsuch as the child labour ban by International Labour\r\nOrganization (ILO) conventions and the spread of the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. My delegation continues to hope\r\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, scheduled for March 2002 in Mexico,\r\nwill adopt strategies to reduce these inequalities\r\nbetween and within countries. It expects from that\r\nConference a definition of the strategic objectives in\r\nterms of consistent policies for integrating developing\r\ncountries into the global economy, whatever their level\r\nof development.\r\nAs to globalization, many indeed are those that\r\ndenounce its perverse effects, as witness the clashes in\r\nSeattle and Genoa. In this context, we are duty-bound\r\nto see to it that globalization becomes a positive force\r\nfor all mankind in the best interests of all. Yet another\r\nissue of concern to my delegation continues to be that\r\nof human dignity, which cannot be conceived as\r\ndivorced from respect for human rights, including that\r\nof self-determination. Towards that end, the delegation\r\nof Burundi continues to hope that the Second\r\nInternational Decade for the Elimination of\r\nColonialism, from 2001 to 2010, proclaimed by the\r\nAssembly by its resolution 55/146 of 8 December\r\n2000, will help to eradicate its last bastions.\r\nIt is impossible to talk about international\r\nconcord without calling to mind the right to justice,\r\ngenuine justice and real fairness in the settlement of\r\ndisputes. On that score my delegation would like yet\r\nagain to reiterate the importance the Government of\r\nBurundi ascribes to the International Criminal Court,\r\nregarding which preliminary steps towards ratification\r\nare being taken. Indeed, my delegation shares the same\r\nconviction as the Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization, Mr. Kofi Annan, when he affirms that we\r\nmust build a world where order and justice reign in\r\nterms of respect for the primacy of law in international\r\nrelations.\r\nThe challenges confronting the international\r\ncommunity are multiple and take many forms. The\r\nefficacy of the Organization will be judged by its\r\nability to keep cohesion intact and to promote people’s\r\nholistic development, so as to fashion a world where all\r\ncan realize their potential and where we all espouse\r\npeace, fraternity and equality. We are all called upon to\r\nstrive towards the realization of that noble cause.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall upon His Excellency Mr. Hasmy Agam, Chairman\r\nof the delegation of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Agam (Malaysia): My delegation would like\r\nto congratulate the distinguished Foreign Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Korea on his election as President of\r\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I have\r\nno doubt that under his able and wise stewardship he\r\nwill be able to guide the proceedings of this Assembly\r\nto a successful conclusion. Our congratulations also go\r\nto the other members of the Bureau, including your\r\ngood self, Sir.\r\nI should also like to join other speakers in\r\nexpressing my delegation’s gratitude to Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri for the excellent manner in which he conducted\r\nand guided the work of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI should also like to congratulate Mr. Kofi Annan\r\non his re-election as Secretary-General for another\r\nfive-year term. We are confident that he will continue\r\nto serve the Organization with the same single-minded\r\ncommitment he has shown in the past. We also\r\ncongratulate him and the United Nations on being\r\nawarded the centennial Nobel Peace Prize. That is due\r\nrecognition of the many contributions that he and the\r\nOrganization have made in the service of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe are gratified that we are finally able to\r\nconvene the general debate after the uncertainties that\r\nwe have had to face in the wake of the horrific events\r\nof 11 September 2001. Malaysia strongly condemned\r\nthe terrorist attacks and shared the anguish of the\r\nAmerican people over the senseless deaths of so many\r\nthousands of innocent people. We once again express\r\nour profound condolences to the United States and\r\nother countries that lost their nationals in that tragedy.\r\nWe ourselves lost a number of our own and understand\r\nthe pain of the bereaved. As an Islamic country, we are\r\nvery much concerned that a group of misguided people,\r\nidentified as Muslims, carried out such terrible acts in\r\nthe name of our sacred religion. They have tarnished\r\nthe name of Islam, which stands for peace, and have\r\ntried to equate their creed of terror with that of our\r\nfaith, thereby doing a great disservice to our great\r\nreligion and our community. Fortunately, their ploy has\r\nnot worked. In this regard we are grateful to President\r\nGeorge W. Bush and other world leaders for\r\ncategorically rejecting the stereotyping and association\r\nof Islam and Muslims with terrorism. In this regard,\r\nevery effort should be made to ensure that people of\r\nthe Islamic faith are not discriminated against simply\r\nbecause of their faith, ethnic background or the country\r\nthey come from.\r\nOn an unrelated matter, my delegation extends its\r\nsincere condolences to the delegations of the United\r\nStates and the Dominican Republic, and those of other\r\nMember States, for the loss of their nationals in the\r\ntragic air crash that occurred yesterday on Long Island.\r\nMalaysia is ready to contribute to the global\r\neffort to combat the scourge of terrorism. In dealing\r\nwith the issue, there is a need for the international\r\ncommunity, through the United Nations, to work out a\r\nsound strategy incorporating all aspects of the problem.\r\nWhile we understand the natural urge for retribution\r\nagainst the people who are believed to be behind the\r\nheinous attacks and their supporters, we do not think\r\nmilitary actions are the best and most effective\r\nsolution, nor politically a wise one. We are concerned\r\nthat military actions may raise more problems than\r\nthey solve. A sound strategy should include, aside from\r\nthe military option, political/diplomatic efforts and\r\nlegal, economic and other measures. It should involve a\r\nlong and sustained campaign in an effort to get at and\r\ndestroy, once and for all, each and every root of the\r\nterrorist organization or organizations behind these\r\nattacks.\r\nA concerted and coordinated effort on the part of\r\nthe international community is the most appropriate\r\nand effective approach. For this purpose there is a need\r\nfor the convening of an international conference at the\r\nhighest level to consider the issue of terrorism in all its\r\naspects and manifestations, including the necessity of\r\nagreeing on the definition of what constitutes\r\nterrorism. That is important so that pure terrorism,\r\nwhich cannot be excused under any pretext, can be\r\ndifferentiated from the legitimate struggles of peoples\r\nunder colonial or alien domination and foreign\r\noccupation for self-determination and national\r\nliberation, as recognized by the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe United Nations and other international declarations.\r\nAgreement on the definition of terrorism is vitally\r\nimportant so as to clear up any ambiguities and\r\nuncertainties that may hamper international\r\ncooperation. Such a conference should also address the\r\nimportant issue of the root causes of, or factors that\r\nspawn, terrorism. Those factors may be political,\r\neconomic or social, but they must be addressed in all\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nseriousness and objectivity so that appropriate\r\nstrategies and practical and effective measures can be\r\nformulated to deal with them.\r\nAs for Afghanistan, there should be an immediate\r\ncessation of the current bombings in order to spare the\r\nhapless people of Afghanistan further harm and\r\nsuffering. They have suffered too long enough — 20\r\nyears too long. They should be allowed to return to\r\ntheir villages and homes to prepare for the cold winter\r\nseason and Ramadan, which are fast approaching. The\r\ncessation of the bombings would also allow for the\r\nreturn of international relief workers so that they can\r\nresume their commendable humanitarian work.\r\nEnormous amounts of international assistance are\r\nrequired. We commend those countries that have\r\nresponded generously and appeal to those that have not\r\ndone so. We ourselves have set up an Afghanistan\r\nRelief Fund with a very positive response from both\r\nthe Government and the public. On the political/\r\ndiplomatic front, the United Nations should make every\r\neffort to bring peace to Afghanistan through a political\r\nsettlement. We hope that the debate that is now going\r\non in the Security Council on this issue will yield\r\nconstructive results.\r\nThe situation in Palestine and the Middle East\r\ncontinues to be a matter of serious concern to the\r\ninternational community. The issue must be urgently\r\naddressed, not only for its own sake but also to prevent\r\nit from being exploited by certain groups of people for\r\ntheir own ends. It is imperative, if enduring peace is to\r\nbe achieved in the Middle East, for the peace process\r\nto be revived on an urgent basis. We believe that the\r\nMitchell report offers a good basis for bringing the\r\nsituation back to the negotiating table. We commend\r\nthe Palestinian Authority for unambiguously accepting\r\nthe report. However, we regret that the Israeli side,\r\nwhile indicating general “acceptance”, rejected major\r\nparts of the report, including the call for the complete\r\ncessation of settlement activity, one of the main causes\r\nof the current cycle of violence in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territory.\r\nThe continued military offensive against the\r\nPalestinians raises questions about the sincerity of the\r\nIsraeli leadership to work for peace. The Israeli\r\nauthorities have tried to cow the Palestinian people by\r\nan overwhelming use of force, using an assortment of\r\nits formidable arsenals. That excessive use of force has\r\nresulted in more than 800 Palestinians being killed and\r\nmore than 20,000 being wounded. Regrettably, the calls\r\nof the international community have fallen on deaf ears\r\nas the Israeli forces continue their offensive against the\r\nPalestinians on the pretext of ending the campaign\r\nagainst terrorism. The aggressive actions by the\r\noccupying Power must cease if peace is to be given a\r\nchance to grow.\r\nThere is no military solution to the problem.\r\nIndeed, the provocative measures taken by Israel will\r\nonly aggravate the situation. We therefore strongly urge\r\nthe Israeli Government to desist from pursuing a\r\nmilitary solution. A just, comprehensive and lasting\r\nsolution is possible only through a negotiated political\r\nsettlement — a process that the international\r\ncommunity and this body must actively pursue. This\r\nmust include the complete withdrawal of Israel from all\r\nArab and Palestinian land occupied since 1967,\r\nincluding the city of Al-Quds al-Sharif and the\r\noccupied Syrian Golan. We also reaffirm our support\r\nfor the establishment of an independent State of\r\nPalestine, with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. Only\r\nthe implementation of all international resolutions on\r\nthe Palestinian issue can guarantee lasting peace\r\nbetween Israel and Palestine. We once again call on\r\nIsrael to comply with Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973) and all other relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. Equally, we look forward to the return of the\r\nSyrian Golan without further delay. We hope to see a\r\nfuture environment that will bring development and\r\nopportunities in a peaceful and stable Middle East.\r\nMalaysia has consistently voiced its opposition to\r\nthe use of sanctions as an instrument of collective\r\npunishment. No one can deny its debilitating effects on\r\nthe general populace of the affected countries. We\r\ntherefore strongly urge the international community, in\r\nparticular the Security Council, to seriously review the\r\nimpact of sanctions on Member States, particularly\r\nthose imposed on Iraq and Libya, which in our view\r\nshould be lifted as soon as possible as they have\r\nalready served their purpose.\r\nThe danger of a nuclear holocaust remains real\r\nand serious. We should strive for the ultimate objective\r\nof a world free of weapons of mass destruction —\r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. We should\r\nmake every effort to strengthen all existing nuclear-\r\nrelated disarmament, arms control and reduction\r\nmeasures. The multilateral search for genuine measures\r\nfor disarmament and non-proliferation, particularly in\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nthe nuclear area, must remain the highest priority on\r\nthe global disarmament agenda.\r\nAfter more than 20 years of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, the United Nations finally recognized its\r\ncatastrophic impact on populations around the world\r\nand convened a special session for an expanded\r\nresponse to the pandemic. It is now up to the\r\ninternational community to take resolute and concerted\r\naction to combat this scourge and to acknowledge that\r\nthe world’s most affected populations are also among\r\nthe poorest and lack the much-needed resources to act\r\nalone. With about 95 per cent of all HIV-infected\r\npeople living in developing countries, it is essential\r\nthat every assistance be given to them to combat the\r\nscourge. We hope that a review conference will be\r\nconvened a few years from now to assess how far we\r\nhave come in our fight against this devastating disease.\r\nRacism constitutes one of the most heinous forms\r\nof human rights violations, not only in itself, but as it\r\nalso gives rise to other egregious forms of systematic\r\nhuman rights violations such as colonialism, slavery\r\nand genocide. These have in turn resulted in poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment, marginalization and social\r\nexclusion for far too many. We are therefore heartened\r\nthat the outcome of the World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance, held in Durban recently, contained\r\nelements that will further our efforts to eradicate\r\nracism, the most prominent of which is the recognition\r\nby the international community that slavery and the\r\nslave trade are crimes against humanity. Unfortunately,\r\nwe view the outcome documents as inadequate as they\r\ndo not sufficiently address the plight of the Palestinian\r\npeople, who are victims of policies based on\r\ndiscrimination and exclusion.\r\nWe look forward to the upcoming special session\r\non children as an affirmation of the centrality of\r\nchildren to our common future and a positive proof of\r\nour commitment to ensuring the survival, protection\r\nand development of all children around the world.\r\nWhile many of the goals set by the World Summit for\r\nChildren have been achieved, an estimated 600 million\r\nchildren are still struggling to survive, eat and learn on\r\nless than $1 a day. Let us also not overlook the plight\r\nof children affected by sanctions, such as the hapless\r\nchildren of Iraq, many of whom do not survive beyond\r\nthe age of five.\r\nMany of us in the developing world had\r\nwelcomed, indeed embraced, globalization almost\r\nunquestioningly as if it were a panacea for all our\r\nproblems, only to be disillusioned over time when we\r\nfound that rather than a holistic process benefiting all\r\nof humanity, it was being pursued more often than not\r\nas a strategy for the benefit of a few. While the world is\r\nricher today, millions of people are still living in\r\nabsolute poverty, suffering from want, sickness and\r\nmalnutrition. Globalization is a complex process, with\r\nas many opportunities as challenges. While the impact\r\nof globalization is profound and pervasive, not all of it\r\nis necessarily positive. As we embrace it there is a need\r\nto ensure that we minimize its negative impact,\r\nparticularly on the developing countries.\r\nIf globalization in its present form is pursued,\r\ncharacterized, inter alia, by weakened national\r\nsovereignty and growing ownership and control of new\r\ntechnologies by powerful nations, it will not be the\r\nuniversal remedy it was thought to be. The Asian\r\nfinancial crisis demonstrated forcefully the downside\r\nof globalization. It demonstrated the inherent\r\ninstability of the world economic system, in which\r\ntrade and economic liberalization have not necessarily\r\nled to faster growth and development for the\r\ndeveloping countries. What is clear is that growth and\r\ndevelopment require an enabling international\r\nenvironment and international support that can promote\r\ngrowth with equity for the benefit of all.\r\nTo enable developing countries to participate in\r\nand benefit equally from globalization, adequate\r\nfunding for development, among other things, is\r\nrequired. It is therefore most disheartening to see the\r\nsteady decline over the years in the volume of official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) to developing\r\ncountries. The continued need for an inflow of ODA\r\nand new and additional financial resources will become\r\neven more critical with the advancement of\r\nglobalization and the shift to the new knowledge-based\r\neconomy. Unless the ODA situation improves, the\r\ndeveloping countries will be further marginalized in a\r\nrapidly globalizing world economy, characterized by\r\nrapid change, high technology and stiff competition.\r\nThe developing countries, particularly the least\r\ndeveloped, must therefore continue to be assisted in a\r\nmore sustained fashion in order to bring about a more\r\nequitable distribution of growth and economic\r\nprosperity. The developing countries, for their part,\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nmust put their house in order by adopting sound\r\neconomic policies.\r\nThe issue of financing for development is\r\nparticularly relevant and vitally important in solving\r\nthe problems of development faced by many countries.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, in Mexico early next year, will provide\r\nthe opportunity for us to achieve international\r\nconsensus on issues pertaining to financing for\r\ndevelopment in all its aspects. We thank the\r\nGovernment of Mexico for its willingness to host that\r\nimportant Conference and look forward to participating\r\nconstructively in Monterrey. We hope that the\r\nConference will be able to address the core problems\r\nrelating to financing for development, including other\r\nsystemic issues such as the reform of the international\r\nfinancial architecture, on which, in spite of a general\r\nrecognition of the need for reform, there has been no\r\nprogress thus far.\r\nAs an innovative source of financing for\r\ndevelopment, the Conference in Monterrey could also\r\nconsider, inter alia, the possibility of establishing an\r\nappropriate system of international taxation for the\r\npurpose of infrastructure-building in the least\r\ndeveloped countries. This international tax, which was\r\nsuggested by my Prime Minister, Mr. Mahathir\r\nMohamad, will be contributed by those countries that\r\nhave benefited from international trade, over and above\r\nthe economic aid given by them to the developing\r\ncountries. Malaysia is quite prepared to contribute to\r\nsuch an infrastructure tax.\r\nThe challenge facing developing countries in\r\nintegrating themselves into the international trading\r\nsystem lies in their ability to fully and actively\r\nparticipate in the multilateral trading system.\r\nRegrettably, many developing countries have not\r\nbenefited from global trade liberalization because of\r\ntheir inability to have access to the markets of\r\ndeveloped countries. Although globalization carries\r\nwith it the notion of free trade, many developed\r\ncountries maintain protectionist regimes and subsidies\r\nas basic instruments of economic policy, even as they\r\ninsist on opening up the markets of the developing\r\ncountries in the name of globalization. It is also\r\ndisappointing to the developing countries that,\r\nstructurally, little has been done in the area of trade to\r\nimprove their ability and capability to compete in the\r\nglobal market. There is, therefore, an urgent need to\r\nfacilitate the integration of the developing countries\r\ninto the global trading system through, inter alia, the\r\nspecial differential measures provided for under the\r\nUruguay Round. A new round, should it be launched,\r\nshould ensure that negotiations effectively address the\r\nparticular concerns and problems of developing\r\ncountries. However, any negotiations will have to\r\nformally recognize that the least developed\r\ncountries — indeed, for that matter, many of the\r\ndeveloping countries — have neither the financial nor\r\nhuman resources to meet their existing obligations, let\r\nalone the outcome of future negotiations. In this regard\r\nwe believe that the role of the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), as\r\none of the few mechanisms concerned with the\r\ndevelopment of the developing countries, is of the\r\nutmost importance. We hope that UNCTAD will\r\ncontinue to play a leading role in helping developing\r\ncountries, particularly in efforts to reach the\r\nMillennium Declaration’s development target of\r\nhalving poverty by the year 2015.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Africa, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration adopted last year, which, among other\r\nthings, pledged to pay special attention to meeting the\r\nspecial needs of Africa. The international community\r\nmust continue to assist African countries in their\r\ndevelopment needs. We should continue to assist our\r\nAfrican brothers in their struggle for lasting peace,\r\npoverty eradication and sustainable development.\r\nMalaysia, for its part, has been able to make a modest\r\ncontribution through the Malaysian Technical\r\nCooperation Programme, launched in 1981. To date,\r\nmany participants from African countries have taken\r\npart in various short-term and medium-term courses in\r\nthe public, administration and technical fields in\r\nMalaysia. We have also developed economic relations\r\nwith some African countries based on the concept of\r\nsmart partnership, involving Governments and the\r\nprivate sector, with the goal of promoting sound and\r\nsustainable economic activities to ensure a win-win\r\nrelationship for all. Within our limited resources,\r\nMalaysia looks forward to further consolidating our\r\ncooperation and solidarity with Africa in the spirit of\r\nSouth-South cooperation.\r\nMalaysia welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\npledge to move the United Nations from a culture of\r\nreaction to a culture of prevention. This culture should\r\nbe the cornerstone of the Organization’s collective\r\nsecurity system for this century. It is a far better and\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nmore cost-effective approach, in financial as well as in\r\nhuman terms, than mounting any operation or activity\r\nafter a conflict has erupted. We are pleased to note that\r\nthe Secretary-General continues to pursue that culture\r\nwith the relevant regional organizations in order to\r\nfurther enhance a comprehensive approach by drawing\r\non regional preventive strategies. We urge the\r\nSecretary-General to continue to consult the relevant\r\nregional or subregional groups in this regard.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to raise an issue that\r\nwas mentioned by my Prime Minister, Mr. Mahathir\r\nMohamad, when he addressed the fifty-fourth session\r\nof the General Assembly. The problem relates to\r\nimmunities granted to nationals of Member States by\r\nvirtue of the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and\r\nImmunities of the United Nations and the 1947\r\nConvention on the Privileges and Immunities of\r\nSpecialized Agencies once they are appointed as\r\nofficials of the United Nations, such as a rapporteur.\r\nWhile Malaysia acknowledges the need for immunities\r\nto be granted to ensure that these officials are able to\r\ncarry out their mandate effectively, it seems that they\r\nare able to hide behind this cloak of immunity for\r\nevery criticism made of their own Government,\r\nincluding words that fall outside their mandate. Surely\r\neven they should be treated as ordinary citizens,\r\ngoverned by the laws of the land, when they are not\r\nofficially “on mission”. My delegation calls for clear\r\nguidelines to govern the conduct of United Nations\r\nofficials, especially when residing in their own\r\ncountries, so that their actions fall strictly within their\r\nmandates and that they will enjoy immunities there\r\nonly at such times as they are officially performing\r\ntheir functions as United Nations officials, and not all\r\nyear round. Surely, also, there should be a better basis\r\nfor the appointment of United Nations officials — a\r\nnominee should be one who is known for his or her\r\nneutral or unbiased views, and not who, in the words of\r\nmy Prime Minister “is well known for his virulent\r\nattacks” — to report on any given matter. Surely on\r\nthis issue the United Nations would be among the first\r\nto agree that while there is a need to protect and ensure\r\nthe freedom and impartiality of its officials, it must\r\nalso, at the same time, protect the rights and interests\r\nof its Member States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Anthony Charles Rolle,\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Rolle (Bahamas): The President has been\r\nelected to chair at what is undoubtedly one of the most\r\nchallenging sessions of the General Assembly in recent\r\ntimes. My delegation congratulates him on his election.\r\nWe pledge our full support to him and express our\r\nconfidence that under his leadership the work of the\r\nAssembly will have a positive impact on our collective\r\nefforts to meet the many challenges facing our world.\r\nMy delegation would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to commend his predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri of Finland, for his leadership as President of\r\nthe fifty-fifth session, the Millennium Assembly.\r\nWe are in times of great tragedy but also of\r\nlaudable triumphs. The Secretary-General and the\r\nUnited Nations have rendered outstanding and\r\ninspiring service to the world’s peoples. Mr. Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we celebrate with you and this Organization\r\nthe well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize awarded to you,\r\neven as we express our appreciation for the exemplary\r\nleadership that you continue to provide to the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to express its sincere sympathy to the\r\nGovernments of the United States and the Dominican\r\nRepublic and to the families of those who lost their\r\nlives in the crash of a United States commercial aircraft\r\nin New York yesterday.\r\nWhile recognizing the many challenges the global\r\ncommunity will face in the twenty-first century, leaders\r\nat last year’s Millennium Assembly nonetheless were\r\noptimistic that peace and prosperity would be\r\nimportant hallmarks of the new century. Their hopes\r\nhave been severely undermined by the indefensible acts\r\nof terrorism perpetrated in the United States on 11\r\nSeptember 2001. The horrific scenes of death and\r\ndestruction in New York, Washington, D.C., and\r\nPennsylvania, so indelibly etched in our minds, have\r\nno doubt changed the world forever. The Government\r\nand the people of the Bahamas mourned with countries\r\nall over the world, including our sister Caribbean\r\ncountries that lost loved ones, and expressed our\r\nsadness at the senseless loss of life and wanton\r\ndestruction of property.\r\nEven as events in Afghanistan unfold, the United\r\nNations, and indeed the world, now face a dilemma:\r\nhow to confront the grave challenge which\r\ninternational terrorism has defiantly issued to the world\r\nand at the same time meet the Charter obligations to\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\npromote human rights and social progress and better\r\nstandards of life in larger freedom. We must be\r\nvisionary and creative in ensuring that the resources\r\nand energies of the United Nations and of the\r\ninternational community are used to implement a\r\nbalanced agenda that will deal effectively and\r\nresolutely with terrorists and terrorism and that will\r\nalso continue to have a positive impact on human\r\nrights, economic and social development and other\r\ncommon objectives.\r\nThe international community has spoken with one\r\nvoice in condemning international terrorism as a major\r\ndestabilizing force in the world. The acts of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 fundamentally shifted security\r\nconcerns regarding terrorists and terrorism to the\r\nworkplace, streets and homes of innocent people,\r\ncreating anxiety, insecurity and uncertainty worldwide.\r\nSignificantly, the terrorist acts have had serious and\r\ndamaging consequences on a rapidly globalizing world\r\neconomy. The economies of both industrialized and\r\ndeveloping countries have been severely disrupted,\r\nwith grave implications for future economic and\r\nfinancial stability. The economic outlook, particularly\r\nfor many developing countries, is indeed grim. The\r\nsmall economies of the countries in the Caribbean have\r\nexperienced massive disruption because of their\r\nvulnerability to external shocks and heavy dependence\r\non tourism, especially from the North American\r\nmarket. There has been significant loss of employment\r\nin the tourism, financial services and related sectors,\r\neven as government revenues have fallen and foreign\r\nreserves are threatened.\r\nThe countries of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) have moved decisively to assess the\r\nimplications of the terrorist attacks on its member\r\nStates. As Chair of the Conference of Heads of\r\nGovernment of CARICOM, the Bahamas was host to a\r\nspecial emergency meeting of the Conference, held on\r\n11 and 12 October 2001, which adopted the Nassau\r\nDeclaration on International Terrorism. That\r\nDeclaration sets out the action that Governments would\r\ntake to mitigate the impact on the region’s tourism,\r\naviation, financial services and agricultural sectors,\r\nwhich are the major contributors to the gross national\r\nproduct, foreign exchange earnings and employment in\r\nthe countries of our region.\r\nCARICOM heads of Government also\r\nunequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and\r\nreaffirmed their commitment to work with the\r\ninternational community in the multifaceted fight\r\nagainst terrorism, in accordance with international law\r\nand conventions. It is therefore our hope that the\r\ninternational community will support the countries of\r\nCARICOM during this difficult and challenging period.\r\nWe in the Bahamas have taken our obligation to\r\ncooperate in the fight against terrorism very seriously.\r\nWe have complied with Security Council resolutions,\r\nincluding resolution 1333 (2000) which calls for the\r\nfreezing of funds and other financial assets of Osama\r\nbin Laden, the Al Qaeda organization and individuals\r\nassociated with it. The International Obligations,\r\nEconomic and Ancillary Measures Order 2001, enacted\r\nin our Parliament in September this year, prohibits any\r\nperson dealing with any property and any financial\r\ninstitution licensed in the Bahamas from transacting\r\nbusiness with Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda or any\r\nindividuals or entities associated with them, who, for\r\nthese purposes, may be designated from time to time.\r\nWe have been able to take such timely action because\r\nof a comprehensive legislative regime enacted in\r\nDecember 2000 which put in place an effective\r\nregulatory regime to ensure that the Bahamas financial\r\nservices sector is not abused by criminals for money-\r\nlaundering or any other financial crimes. It was the\r\nenactment of that legislation that resulted in the\r\nFinancial Action Task Force’s removal of the Bahamas,\r\nin June of this year, from its list of non-cooperative\r\njurisdictions in the fight against money-laundering. As\r\npart of its overall review of the international regime for\r\naction against terrorists and terrorism, in October this\r\nyear my Government signed the United Nations\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism. We are following very closely the\r\ndiscussions on a comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism, in order to determine what further action the\r\nGovernment will need to take in this area. We hope that\r\na comprehensive, practical and implementable\r\ninstrument will be adopted that will take into account\r\nthe existing anti-terrorism regime. In this we see a\r\nclearly delineated role for the United Nations, and\r\nparticularly the Security Council, which is well placed\r\nto articulate a coherent policy for global cooperation in\r\nthe fight against international terrorism.\r\nMeeting our obligations, however, has not been\r\nwithout sacrifice. The Bahamas, like many other\r\nCaribbean countries, has been obliged to divert scarce\r\nresources from other critical development objectives to\r\ninitiate the sweeping security changes required at our\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nairports and seaports and otherwise to mitigate the\r\nimpact of the 11 September events.\r\nFor the Government and people of the Bahamas,\r\nthe ravages of hurricane Michelle have further\r\ncompounded the significant economic setbacks caused\r\nby the 11 September events in the United States. Just\r\nlast week, that hurricane made a direct hit on our\r\narchipelagic State, causing extensive damage to\r\ninfrastructure, agriculture and vegetation in some of\r\nour major islands. The Government is still determining\r\nthe extent of the damage but has already begun the\r\nessential period of reconstruction.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nGlobalization and trade liberalization are, and\r\nmust remain, central issues on the world’s agenda.\r\nGenerally, globalization has presented significant\r\nopportunities and has had a positive impact on many\r\ncountries. However, for others, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping world, the freer flow of capital, technology,\r\nfinance, goods and services across national\r\nboundaries — which is the essence of globalization —\r\nhas not met the stated objectives of improving overall\r\neconomic prosperity, reducing poverty and closing the\r\ntechnological gap. On the contrary, the social costs of\r\nglobalization — poverty, inequality and\r\nunemployment — remain serious challenges for many\r\nof the countries of the developing world. These\r\nchallenges are further compounded by factors including\r\nan onerous debt burden, a limited or inadequate export\r\ninfrastructure to effectively participate in the global\r\ntrading system, and an inability to access the markets\r\nof the developed world. My Government, nevertheless,\r\nis cognizant that the international trading regime of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) provides a\r\nsignificant framework within which countries may\r\nbenefit from globalization and trade liberalization, and\r\nwork towards appropriately addressing the costs and\r\nrisks associated with the global trading system. In July\r\nthis year, the Bahamas submitted its application for\r\naccession to the WTO, for WTO membership is a\r\npriority for my Government and we hope that our\r\napplication will receive the requisite support.\r\nWe are in a period, leading up to late 2002,\r\nduring which the United Nations is defining its\r\neconomic and social development agenda with greater\r\nprecision, through a series of assessments of\r\ninternational action in specific areas. The Bahamas was\r\npleased to have participated in the Organization’s\r\nreview of its work and setting of its agenda for further\r\naction in the areas of racism, racial discrimination and\r\nhuman settlements and the illicit trade in small arms\r\nand light weapons. My Government believes that every\r\neffort should be made to consolidate those areas in\r\nwhich progress was made at the World Conference\r\nagainst Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia\r\nand Related Intolerance that took place in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa, from 31 August to 8 September this year.\r\nGlobal objectives in respect of human settlements\r\nreceived considerable impetus from the special session\r\non human settlements that took place in New York in\r\nJune 2001. The Declaration on Cities and Other Human\r\nSettlements in the New Millennium, adopted by the\r\nConference, should prove invaluable in addressing\r\nchronic problems of inadequate shelter.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects addressed a problem that for the small\r\ncountries of the Caribbean is a particularly serious one.\r\nWe wished the Conference could have been more\r\nforthright in its adoption of measures to better address\r\nthese critical issues but readily accept the Programme\r\nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects as an essential first step. Decisions taken at\r\nthese and other United Nations meetings are indeed\r\ndecisions of the Organization that the Bahamas hopes\r\nwill be implemented as such by all Member States.\r\nFew countries in the world, if any, have been\r\nspared the vagaries of HIV/AIDS. The statistics are\r\ncompelling — more than 30 million people affected.\r\nWith respect to the developing world they are even\r\nmore compelling — more than 95 per cent of those\r\naffected live in the developing world. The Caribbean\r\nregion has not been spared, but we are taking decisive\r\naction. Our Pan-Caribbean Partnership launched in\r\nFebruary this year has the full support and commitment\r\nof heads of Government for effective action against\r\nHIV/AIDS in the wider Caribbean region. The\r\nGovernment of the Bahamas in this regard welcomes\r\nthe contribution of the Government of Canada to the\r\nCaribbean HIV/AIDS programme. The special session\r\non HIV/AIDS held in New York in June 2001 gave\r\nheads of State and Government the opportunity to set\r\nan agenda for slowing and reversing the destructive\r\nimpact of HIV/AIDS throughout the world. It is an\r\nagenda that must be implemented to halt and reverse\r\nthis tragedy that is devastating populations and\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nthreatening to reverse the development gains made in\r\nmany developing countries. The developing world will,\r\nand must, look for help and support to those having the\r\ntechnology, research capacity and resources by which\r\nthey themselves have been able to control the spread of\r\nthis deadly disease.\r\nThe year 2002 will also be an active one, both for\r\nUnited Nations benchmark assessments and\r\nreadjustment of priorities and for addressing significant\r\nissues on the international agenda. The International\r\nConference on Financing for Development will be\r\nconvened in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002. As\r\nplans develop, we hope that all Members of the United\r\nNations will come to appreciate the need to ensure that\r\nthe Conference provides the framework within which\r\ncommitments can be made so that technical assistance\r\ncan be provided to poor countries for basic\r\ninfrastructural development, the standards of people\r\nworldwide who live in endemic poverty can be raised,\r\ndeveloping countries can be assisted to attract foreign\r\ndirect investment, and information technology can be\r\nmore freely transferred to developing countries. My\r\nGovernment, for its part, is of the view that small,\r\ndeveloping, middle-income countries such as the\r\nBahamas, because of their economic and ecological\r\nvulnerabilities, should not be excluded from\r\ndevelopment financing. It is also the view of my\r\nGovernment that the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be convened in South Africa in\r\nSeptember 2002, should be complementary to\r\nundertakings made at the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development. Ten years after the Rio\r\nSummit of 1992, the ever-increasing fury of natural\r\ndisasters, climate change and sea-level rise, and the\r\ndepletion of biological resources and overall\r\nenvironmental degradation, are but some of the issues\r\nbegging reassessment that must be part of the blueprint\r\nfor determined action emanating from South Africa.\r\nLikewise, the Bahamas hopes that the Second World\r\nAssembly on Ageing, to be held in Madrid, Spain, in\r\n2002, and the special session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly on children, postponed to 2002,\r\nshould assess progress but, more importantly, must\r\nemphasize action that will provide guidance for\r\nnational, regional and international policy and planning\r\nin their respective areas.\r\nThe initiatives the United Nations will take up in\r\n2002 to review and assess progress in a significant\r\nnumber of areas should bring clearly into focus the\r\nactions that must be taken by Member States and by the\r\nOrganization to accomplish agreed economic and\r\nsocial objectives. It is the hope of the Bahamas that\r\nthese reviews will be followed by a period of intense\r\nimplementation of decisions that have been agreed, so\r\nthat qualitative and quantitative improvements may be\r\nrealized in all areas. We believe that such\r\nimprovements are essential but must be in concert with\r\nUnited Nations initiatives to meet demands in other\r\ncritical areas, such as conflict resolution, war, and\r\nhumanitarian crises worldwide. They should also be in\r\nconcert with the Organization’s efforts to address\r\neffectively and comprehensively issues such as the\r\nillicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic\r\nsubstances, the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons, alien smuggling and refugee flows, which do\r\nnot respect national boundaries. In all such cases, the\r\ndanger of inaction could have dire consequences,\r\nparticularly for international peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, the current preoccupation with\r\nterrorism has fortunately not paralysed the United\r\nNations. What it has done is to emphasize the need for\r\nan effective and cohesive United Nations, capable of\r\nresponding flexibly to unexpected and contradictory\r\nevents in a timely and effective manner with little or no\r\ndisruption of its programmes in other areas. We believe\r\nthat the United Nations Charter constitutes a viable and\r\nfirm foundation for the Organization to balance and\r\nachieve its objectives, to maintain international peace\r\nand security and promote economic and social\r\nprogress. The Bahamas fully supports the United\r\nNations in all its endeavours.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol, Chairman of the delegation of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Li Hyong Chol (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text\r\nfurnished by the delegation): I congratulate you, Sir,\r\nonce again on your election as President of the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly. I also wish to\r\nexpress high appreciation to Mr. Harri Holkeri, who\r\ncarried out his duties as President of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly in an excellent\r\nmanner. I would like to take this opportunity to extend\r\nwarm congratulations again to Mr. Kofi Annan on his\r\nre-election as Secretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nLast year, heads of State and Government\r\nthroughout the world held the Millennium Summit in\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nthis Hall and committed themselves to building a\r\npeaceful and prosperous world in the new century. That\r\ngave high hope and expectations to all people of the\r\nworld. However, the developments that are now taking\r\nplace on the globe overshadow possible\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Summit\r\ncommitments. The principles of respect for national\r\nsovereignty and equality that constitute a cornerstone\r\nof international relations are being undermined by\r\ncertain forces that consider strength as the means to\r\nachieve everything. As long as there is acquiescence to\r\nacts of arbitrary power that seek to destroy strategic\r\nstability and hold absolute supremacy by establishing a\r\nmissile defence system in defiance of international\r\nopposition, the world will be engulfed in another cold\r\nwar and arms race.\r\nThe problem of the Korean peninsula always\r\ncomes up as one of the major issues in deliberations on\r\nglobal peace and security. That is because of the power\r\npolicy and arbitrary actions directed in most cases\r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We\r\nare exposed to constant threats from huge armed\r\nforces, including nuclear weapons, deployed around the\r\nKorean peninsula on the pretext of an alleged threat\r\nfrom North Korea, and that is the main source of\r\ninstability on the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-\r\nPacific region. That notwithstanding, we have been\r\nable firmly to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the\r\ncountry on our own in the face of the offensive by\r\nhostile forces, and under difficult conditions\r\nresembling an arduous march, unprecedented in our\r\nhistory, thus contributing to the peace and security of\r\nthe region. That is entirely attributable to the\r\noutstanding army-first policies of the respected General\r\nKim Jong Il. The great leader General Kim Jong Il\r\nconducted active diplomacy, including his visit to\r\nChina and Russia and his meeting with the top-level\r\ndelegation of the European Union this year, and thus\r\nmade a great contribution to developing overall\r\ninternational relations and strengthening global peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn particular, the summit meetings and talks\r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\r\nand Russia and the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea and China resulted in the adoption of documents\r\nreflecting shared views on strengthening the leading\r\nrole of the United Nations in resolving major\r\ninternational issues, ensuring strategic balance, and so\r\non. This serves as an historic milestone in establishing\r\na fair, new world, based on the principles of mutual\r\nrespect and cooperation for mutual benefit. We will, as\r\never, firmly defend our sovereignty and the socialist\r\nsystem of our country and advance convincingly along\r\nthe road chosen by ourselves under the army-first\r\nleadership of the respected General Kim Jong Il.\r\nIt is the unanimous desire of all Korean people to\r\nreunify the divided country at the earliest possible date.\r\nLast year, the inter-Korean summit meeting was held\r\nand the North-South Joint Declaration issued for the\r\nfirst time in the history of the national division, thanks\r\nto the idea of national independence and great national\r\nunity of the great leader, Comrade Kim Jong Il. The\r\nJoint Declaration reflects the will and aspirations of the\r\nKorean people to achieve reunification independently\r\nby pooling the efforts of the nation. It enjoys wide\r\nsupport and is welcomed by the international\r\ncommunity. The General Assembly, at its fifty-fifth\r\nsession, unanimously adopted the resolution supporting\r\nthe Joint Declaration. With the publication of the Joint\r\nDeclaration, the enthusiasm for reunification was\r\nmanifested throughout the Korean peninsula and\r\ndialogues and contacts in various fields took place\r\nbetween the North and the South of Korea. It\r\ndemonstrated that the Korean nation could well open\r\nthe door to reunification by itself, if the North and the\r\nSouth make joint efforts with sincere will for\r\nindependent reunification. However, inter-Korean\r\nrelations and the implementation of the 15 June Joint\r\nDeclaration, which were proceeding well and in the\r\nright direction, now face a big obstacle due to the hard-\r\nline, hostile policy and unjust interference of the new\r\nUnited States Administration against the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nThe half-century history of national division and,\r\nin particular, experiences during the past year, clearly\r\nshow that the North and South of Korea should, above\r\nall, adhere to a stance of national independence if they\r\nare to implement the North-South Joint Declaration.\r\nOnly when the North and South collaborate as one\r\nnation will they open up a bright future for the nation,\r\nwithout becoming a victim of outside forces. The most\r\nimportant element in implementing the North-South\r\nJoint Declaration and achieving peace and reunification\r\non the Korean peninsula is to put an end to the hostile\r\npolicy and interference of the United States against the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. It is totally\r\nirrational to say that the United States deploys huge\r\narmed forces in and around the Korean peninsula and\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nconducts large-scale military exercises against us to\r\nadvance peace, self-defensive measures taken by my\r\ncountry to cope with the United States military threat is\r\na threat to peace. Our missile programme is of a purely\r\npeaceful nature and does not pose a threat to any\r\ncountry that respects the sovereignty of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nIt makes no sense for the United States to argue\r\nthat it needs to establish a missile defence system out\r\nof fear of our missiles while itself possessing\r\nthousands of nuclear bombs and missiles that could\r\nextinguish humankind many times over. That argument\r\nonly covers up the United States strategy to gain\r\ndomination of the world, based on superior power.\r\nSince the cold war is over and the North and South of\r\nKorea are proceeding towards reconciliation and\r\ncooperation in accordance with the 15 June Joint\r\nDeclaration, there is neither reason nor any other\r\nground whatsoever for United States troops to remain\r\nin the South of Korea. Withdrawal of United States\r\ntroops from South Korea is an urgent issue whose\r\nsolution should not brook any further delay in the\r\ninterest of ensuring peace and security on the Korean\r\npeninsula and in North-East Asia. Dialogue should be\r\nconducted on a fair and equal basis. Resumption of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea-United States\r\nof America dialogue will only be possible when the\r\npresent United States Administration gets rid of its\r\ncold-war mentality and adopts a stance at least at the\r\nlevel of the one taken by the Clinton Administration in\r\nthe last period of its term of office.\r\nDuring the past two years, we have established\r\nofficial relations with almost all member States of the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) and diplomatic relations with the\r\nEU itself, and countries of other regions as well, on the\r\nbasis of the principles of respect for sovereignty and\r\nequality. We are also ready to develop relations with\r\nthe United States on the principles of equality and\r\nmutual benefit if the United States respects our\r\nsovereignty and freedom of choice, takes an attitude of\r\ngood will towards us on an equal footing, and refrains\r\nfrom obstructing the reunification of Korea.\r\nAnother factor of instability that casts a dark\r\nshadow on the future development of the Korean\r\npeninsula and its surroundings is the orientation of\r\nJapanese moves, that is, the ultra-rightist inclination of\r\nJapan and its undisguised attempt to revive militarism.\r\nMy delegation wishes to draw the attention of all\r\nMember States to this matter at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly held in the first year of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. The Japanese authorities are not willing to\r\nterminate their past crimes against humanity, but try\r\ninstead to justify them, openly visiting the Yasukuni\r\nShrine, where the departed souls of the war criminals\r\nare enshrined, distorting history textbooks for new\r\ngenerations and legalizing the overseas advance of the\r\nJapanese self-defence force.\r\nOn 29 August, Japan test-fired an H-2A large-size\r\ndelivery rocket that could easily be converted into an\r\nintercontinental ballistic missile. That is a clear\r\nindication that the militarism of Japan has become\r\npoliticized and is proceeding to an open and dangerous\r\nstage.\r\nJapan, which has always stigmatized our peaceful\r\nsatellite launch as a missile launch, said openly that its\r\ntest-fire of the rocket was done to cope with North\r\nKorea’s missile, thus invoking military confrontation.\r\nJapan should not misjudge our moratorium on satellite\r\nlaunches and the peaceful character of our missile\r\nprogramme. We strongly urge Japan to look squarely at\r\nreality; put an end to its past inhumane crimes, and\r\nsincerely turn to the road of peace in this new century.\r\nThat will be good for the future of Japan.\r\nThe most important task of Member States today\r\nis to strengthen the central role of the United Nations\r\nwith regard to international issues. It is essential that\r\nMember States honour and implement the United\r\nNations Charter in good faith. The United Nations\r\nCharter enshrines the purposes and principles for\r\ndeveloping friendly international relations on the basis\r\nof sovereign equality. However, certain countries do\r\nnot hesitate to undertake unilateral coercive actions and\r\neven resort to the use of force against sovereign States,\r\nignoring and violating the United Nations Charter.\r\nMember States should reject any attempt that goes\r\nagainst the United Nations Charter and other principles\r\nand norms of international law, and should strive to\r\nestablish a fair, new world structure based on the rule\r\nof law, equality, mutual respect and cooperation for\r\nmutual benefit, with a view to ensuring world security\r\nand stability. If the leading role of the United Nations\r\nin dealing with global issues is to be strengthened, the\r\nUnited Nations should be reformed in a democratic\r\nway. In this regard, we are of the view that it is\r\nessential to strengthen the authority of the General\r\nAssembly. The General Assembly must be empowered\r\nto consider issues relating to world peace and security\r\nand approve major resolutions of the Security Council\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\non these issues. Reform of the Security Council should\r\nbe pursued in the context of strengthening the authority\r\nof the General Assembly. We hold that the Security\r\nCouncil reform should be undertaken in full conformity\r\nwith its intrinsic purpose. The Security Council reform\r\nmust ensure enough representation of the developing\r\ncountries and full fairness in United Nations activities\r\nfor achieving international peace and security. We\r\nplace on record our strong opposition to considering in\r\nany manner the permanent membership of Japan on the\r\nSecurity Council when it has neither put an end to nor\r\nrecognized its past crimes, and while no agreement has\r\nyet been reached on increasing the number of\r\npermanent members.\r\nOne of the major challenges to the United\r\nNations and its Member States today is global poverty,\r\nwhich grows ever more serious. Poverty, which has\r\nresulted from colonialism in the past, continues to be\r\naggravated due to the inequitable international\r\nmonetary systems and neo-colonial policies. It also\r\nbecomes a factor that begets conflicts, diseases and\r\nhunger and hampers the independent and creative life\r\nof peoples and their enjoyment of the right to\r\ndevelopment. If poverty is to be eradicated, a fair and\r\nequitable international economic order should be\r\nestablished and sustainable development ensured. We\r\nwill have to draw due lessons from the demonstrations\r\nin Genoa last July and properly handle the issue of\r\nglobalization. In this regard, it should be underlined\r\nthat the developed countries and the international\r\nfinancial institutions assume big responsibilities. The\r\nUnited Nations should encourage Member States to\r\ndirect their attention to considering more practical\r\nmeasures for eradicating poverty and achieving\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is the consistent and principled position of the\r\nGovernment of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea to oppose support, of whatever kind, to any\r\nforms of terrorism. The large-scale terrorist incident\r\nthat occurred in the United States on 11 September was\r\nvery regrettable and tragic and reminds us of the\r\ngravity of terrorism. The situation in Afghanistan is\r\nnow grave, where instability and unprecedented human\r\nloss and material damage are brought about by the\r\nmilitary operation of the United States. The prevailing\r\nsituation requires that the leading role of the United\r\nNations in preventing terrorism be definitely\r\nstrengthened and the national obligations for the\r\nelimination of terrorism be fully discharged by all\r\nMember States.\r\nYesterday we signed the International Convention\r\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and\r\nacceded to the International Convention against the\r\nTaking of Hostages. That shows that we are making\r\nevery possible effort to eliminate terrorism in the\r\nworld. As already stated, the aim of our opposing\r\nterrorism is to promote global peace and stability,\r\ndefend the sovereignty of the country and nation and\r\nprotect the lives and property of the peoples of the\r\nworld. We are strongly of the view that imposing the\r\nlabel of terrorist on countries that advocate sovereign\r\nequality, while violating their sovereignty and\r\ninflicting immeasurable pain on the people by resorting\r\nto arbitrary armed intervention, sanctions, and so on,\r\nshould in no way be tolerated. There is no justification\r\nin any case for the use of force or resorting to war and\r\ntaking innocent lives, undermining the situation and\r\ndestroying stability in the fight against terrorism.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reaffirm that the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue\r\nto cooperate fully with all Member States to uphold\r\nand implement the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter under the ideas of\r\nindependence, peace and friendship.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Rashid Alimov, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nTajikistan.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): This\r\nsession of the General Assembly is facing the very\r\nimportant task of comparing and coordinating the\r\npositions of the members of the international\r\ncommunity on the most urgent issues of our time, that\r\nis, ensuring strategic stability and equal security for all\r\nStates, strengthening the coordinating role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and the settlement of regional\r\nconflict, fighting poverty and disease, and creating\r\nconditions for sustainable development and prosperity\r\nof all peoples on our planet. It is clear that the search\r\nfor a collective response to the unprecedented\r\nchallenge thrown down to mankind by international\r\nterrorism on 11 September has become a key subject of\r\nthis session.\r\nThe twentieth century proved convincingly that\r\nthe United Nations has indeed become the centre for\r\nharmonizing the actions of nations in maintaining\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\npeace, ensuring collective security, developing\r\ninternational cooperation, and ensuring respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. Thanks to the\r\njoint efforts of its Member States, the Organization has,\r\nin 55 years, become a universal forum capable of\r\ndeveloping joint political approaches of the community\r\nof nations towards resolving the most urgent and\r\ncomplicated problems of world development. The role\r\nof the United Nations as the most representative\r\ninternational forum for discussing the whole range of\r\nproblems faced by mankind, and developing\r\napproaches for international cooperation in dealing\r\nwith such problems, is becoming more significant with\r\neach passing year. In the view of the President of\r\nTajikistan, Emomali Rakhmonov, the task of\r\nstrengthening the central role of the United Nations has\r\nbecome more rather than less urgent.\r\nDuring the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly the Republic of Tajikistan will be celebrating\r\nthe tenth anniversary of its United Nations\r\nmembership. Since the first day of its international\r\nrecognition, Tajikistan has been working closely with\r\nthe United Nations. Cooperation with the United\r\nNations in the first years of its independence helped\r\nTajikistan to stop civil strife, to find an effective\r\nformula for peace and national accord and now to start\r\npost-conflict peace-building.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nWe will never forget that dramatic period and the\r\nselfless assistance and support that we were given by\r\nMember States, the Security Council, and specialized\r\nagencies. Our special gratitude goes to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose contribution to the\r\nsettlement of the inter-Tajik conflict deserves the\r\ngreatest appreciation. We believe that the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize awarded to the United Nations also reflects the\r\nsuccess achieved under its leadership by the\r\ninternational community in the peaceful settlement of\r\nthe internal conflict in Tajikistan and in overcoming its\r\nconsequences. We are convinced that the unique\r\nexperience of peacemaking in Tajikistan deserves in-\r\ndepth consideration and study. Practical lessons learned\r\nfrom the settlement of the inter-Tajik conflict and the\r\nUnited Nations peacemaking activities will enable the\r\ninternational community to find new approaches\r\ntowards resolving conflicts in other hot spots on the\r\nplanet.\r\nThe variety of problems dealt with by the United\r\nNations highlights the unique and universal role played\r\nby the Organization in regulating international affairs.\r\nThat is particularly important in the field of\r\ninternational security. The Republic of Tajikistan calls\r\nfor ensuring strategic stability in the world based on\r\nmaintaining the existing system of agreements and\r\ntreaties on disarmament and a continuing process of\r\narms limitation, on both a unilateral and multilateral\r\nbasis. Tajikistan, for its part, is prepared to make its\r\ncontribution to this process. In cooperation with our\r\nneighbouring States, we are actively working to\r\nimplement the initiative of establishing a nuclear-free\r\nzone in Central Asia. We hope that a treaty to this\r\neffect will shortly be ready for signing by the heads of\r\nState in our region, and expect that all nuclear Powers\r\nwill become its guarantors.\r\nThe appalling acts of terror perpetrated in the\r\nUnited States on 11 September forced the whole world\r\nto confront the issue of international terrorism and take\r\na fresh look at it. In order to solve this problem, it will\r\nbe necessary to analyse the whole set of new\r\nchallenges and threats and develop new approaches\r\ntowards creating a credible and effective system for\r\ncountering them. May I remind Member States that, on\r\nbehalf of the people of Tajikistan, immediately after\r\nthe terrorist acts, President Emomali Rakhmonov\r\nconveyed sincere condolences and sympathy to the\r\nfamilies of all those who had died or suffered. He\r\nexpressed full solidarity with the people of the United\r\nStates and readiness to cooperate closely with their\r\nGovernment and the Governments of other States in\r\neradicating international terrorism.\r\nTajikistan has always condemned terrorism in all\r\nits manifestations and categorically rejects the use of\r\nterrorist acts as a means of achieving political or other\r\ngoals. We reject any attempts to justify acts of terror on\r\npolitical, religious, philosophical, ethnic or racial\r\ngrounds. International cooperation in combating\r\nterrorism and extremism is not an abstract notion for\r\nour country. The Tajik people are very well aware of\r\nthe methods and practices of international terrorism. In\r\nrecent years, Tajikistan has repeatedly been a target of\r\nterrorist activities carried out from outside. In addition\r\nto the huge material losses, such actions always entail\r\nloss of life and enormous human suffering. What is\r\nworse, terrorism attempts not only to derail the peace\r\nprocess in Tajikistan, but also to destabilize the\r\nsituation over a vast region of Asia. Acts of\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\ninternational terrorism constitute a grave threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. In combating\r\nterrorism in any part of our planet, the international\r\ncommunity should be guided by similar criteria and act\r\nin a resolute, sincere and, most important, consistent\r\nmanner. All States must unconditionally and fully\r\nimplement the provisions of United Nations Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), including those which\r\ncall for depriving terrorists and their sponsors of\r\nfinancial or any other support and haven.\r\nWe believe that one of the primary objectives of\r\nthis session of the General Assembly is to consolidate\r\nthe legal framework, under United Nations auspices,\r\nfor the interaction of States in combating international\r\nterrorism. In our view, the early adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on combating international\r\nterrorism and the convention on combating acts of\r\nnuclear terrorism could be of great significance in this\r\nregard. On various occasions, in particular from this\r\nrostrum, the President of Tajikistan has called for\r\nuniting the efforts of the community of nations to\r\ncombat the international terrorist underground. Our\r\ncountry has interacted effectively with other States in\r\ncombating international terrorism on a bilateral and\r\nmultilateral basis, in particular within the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the\r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization and other\r\ninternational organizations. The United Nations, with\r\nits unprecedented experience and authority in\r\ncoordinating the efforts of its Member States, is called\r\nupon to play the key role in establishing a global\r\nsystem to counteract a threat of such magnitude as\r\ninternational terrorism. It will take much effort and\r\ntime. However, the lofty and vitally important goal of\r\neradicating this dreadful phenomenon is worthy of such\r\nendeavour.\r\nThe five weeks that have elapsed since the\r\nbeginning of the military operation in Afghanistan have\r\nproved that the Afghan problem cannot be resolved by\r\nmeans of force alone. There is simply no military\r\nsolution to it, and history has provided convincing\r\nproof of that. At the high-level meeting yesterday of\r\nthe Six plus Two Group, and today at the meeting of\r\nthe Security Council on Afghanistan, the delegation of\r\nTajikistan emphasized that under current circumstances\r\nthe Afghan people have a unique opportunity to return\r\nto peaceful and stable development. This is an\r\nopportunity for Afghanistan to become a full-fledged\r\nmember of the international community and to change\r\nits unfortunate image of an accomplice in international\r\nterrorism and other criminal, destructive, destabilizing\r\nmovements. The Afghan nation is on the threshold of\r\nfundamental change. The most crucial task, and I\r\nwould say a matter of honour for the international\r\ncommunity, is to help the Afghan people to take\r\nadvantage of this opportunity. Everything must be done\r\nto make sure that in the future Afghanistan is no longer\r\na threat to the Afghans themselves, to neighbouring\r\ncountries and to international security overall.\r\nEverything must be done in order to ensure respect for\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms in\r\nAfghanistan, including putting an end to the shameful\r\ndiscrimination against women and girls. Everything\r\nmust be done to restore to the Afghan people hope for a\r\npeaceful future and prosperity. Tajikistan is prepared,\r\nin cooperation with other concerned States, and with a\r\ncentral coordinating role for the United Nations, to\r\nassist Afghanistan, a country with a great history, to\r\nregain a worthy future and to restore its former\r\nattractive image in the eyes of the international\r\ncommunity. We believe that determining the future of\r\nAfghanistan is the exclusive prerogative of the Afghan\r\npeople themselves. One of the indispensable conditions\r\nfor returning Afghanistan to a peaceful life is ending\r\noutside interference and uniting, under United Nations\r\nauspices, the efforts of the international community to\r\naccelerate the process of political settlement of the\r\nAfghan problem and the rehabilitation of the country.\r\nFurthermore, it is essential that all hotbeds of\r\nterrorism, elements of organized crime and the\r\nstructures and — most importantly — the production\r\npotential of the drug business be eliminated in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nIt goes without saying that the territorial integrity\r\nof Afghanistan must be guaranteed. Only the\r\nestablishment of a freely chosen, effective, broad-\r\nbased, politically balanced and multi-ethnic Afghan\r\nadministration can guarantee peace and stability in the\r\ncountry. It also goes without saying that the Taliban\r\nmovement as a political group has no place in a future\r\nAfghan administration since this could be fraught with\r\nthe danger of the recurrence of terrorism and the drug\r\ntrade in Afghanistan.\r\nWe are profoundly concerned about the grave\r\nhumanitarian situation in Afghanistan. The refusal of\r\nthe Taliban regime to fulfil the demands of the anti-\r\nterrorist coalition to hand over the masterminds and\r\norganizers of the acts of terror in the United States has\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nresulted in new sufferings for the Afghan people and an\r\nincrease in the numbers of refugees and displaced\r\npersons. According to the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, among the 22\r\nmillion refugees throughout the world, at least one out\r\nof six is an Afghan. According to the estimates of the\r\nhumanitarian organizations, the drought that has\r\ncontinued for three years in Afghanistan has already\r\nresulted in the incredible impoverishment of the entire\r\npopulation, and military operations and the\r\napproaching winter have placed millions of Afghan\r\npeople on the edge of extinction. The actual reality is\r\nsuch that the coming winter threatens millions of\r\nAfghans with death from starvation. Right after the\r\nbeginning of the United States anti-terrorist operation\r\nin Afghanistan, the Tajikistan Government issued a\r\nspecial decision expressing its readiness to open its\r\nairspace and related infrastructure for providing\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan\r\nwho have been suffering from the Taliban tyranny for a\r\nlong time. We call upon all Member States and\r\nhumanitarian institutions and organizations to give all\r\nthe necessary assistance to the people of Afghanistan\r\nwithout delay. If that is not done, then Afghanistan will\r\nbecome the scene of a horrendous humanitarian\r\ntragedy. It could cause a wave of instability in\r\nneighbouring States and in the region as a whole. We\r\ncannot allow that to happen.\r\nThe policy of drug production and export pursued\r\nby the Taliban regime can be described as a policy\r\nagainst humanity. It is sad that Afghanistan, one of the\r\nfounding Members of the United Nations and one of\r\nthe cradles of world civilization and culture, has now,\r\nthrough the fault of the Taliban regime, become one of\r\nthe world’s largest producers of lethal drugs.\r\nAccording to the United Nations Office for Drug\r\nControl and Crime Prevention, the considerable\r\ndecrease in the poppy crop in Afghanistan this year has\r\nnot resulted in a reduction of illicit heroin trafficking,\r\neither to neighbouring countries or to Europe. Huge\r\namounts of raw opium stored in the Taliban-controlled\r\nterritory were used for heroin trafficking. The quantity\r\nof heroin that has been destroyed in Tajikistan this year\r\nalone is three times as much as last year, and this\r\namounts to tons of this deadly product.\r\nAs a result of the tragic events of 11 September, a\r\nnew situation has emerged in Afghanistan. The United\r\nNations has been unable to continue assistance to the\r\nAfghan farmers and exercise control over drug\r\nproduction and trade. The Taliban movement, for\r\nwhom, under the current circumstances, drug\r\ntrafficking has become one of its major sources of\r\nincome, took advantage of this situation. That has put\r\nan additional burden on neighbouring countries, such\r\nas Tajikistan, that are trying to block drug trafficking\r\nfrom Afghanistan. We understand that the drug threat\r\nemanating from Afghanistan can be eliminated only\r\nthrough a lasting peace settlement in the country and\r\nby establishing a new coalition government that would\r\nensure fulfilment of all its international commitments.\r\nHowever, that will take time. For this reason we\r\nexpress our gratitude to the Office for Drug Control\r\nand Crime Prevention and to all donor States that are\r\nfunding the anti-drug programmes implemented by the\r\nOffice, and call upon them to increase their assistance\r\nto Tajikistan in its noble struggle against illicit flows of\r\ndeadly substances from Afghanistan, a struggle that\r\nserves the interests of millions of people in various\r\ncountries. We in Tajikistan attach great importance to\r\nthis struggle and view it as an important contribution to\r\ncombating international terrorism by depriving it of\r\none of the main sources of its financial support.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and Millennium\r\nAssembly, which have become milestones in the\r\ninternational dialogue, identified globalization as the\r\nmain challenge to the international community. There\r\nis no doubt that globalization, which is an objective\r\neconomic process, provides unprecedented\r\nopportunities for accelerated development. At the same\r\ntime, it is obvious that the benefits of globalization are\r\ndistributed quite unequally, and the balance of benefits\r\nand costs is definitely in favour of the developed\r\nnations. The conclusion is obvious: for various reasons\r\nmany developing countries and economies in transition\r\nrun the serious risk of finding themselves on the\r\nsidelines, away from the mainstream development of\r\ncivilization. Only by applying all available mechanisms\r\nof multilateral international institutions can we stop the\r\nwidening gap in development and incomes between\r\nrich and poor countries that was caused by\r\nglobalization, and prevent an increase in poverty,\r\nunequal access to advanced technologies, cross-border\r\ncrime and the spread of hidden forms of discrimination\r\nin international trade.\r\nAs for Tajikistan, it faces the long-term problem\r\nof rebuilding a country that has been heavily damaged\r\nby civil strife. The Government is undertaking all\r\npossible measures to strengthen civil society, to\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nencourage economic recovery and to create favourable\r\nconditions for healthy and sustainable social and\r\neconomic development. We hope that the participants\r\nin the Consultative Group Meeting for Tajikistan, held\r\nin Tokyo in May 2001, will fulfil their commitments to\r\nTajikistan, which would enable us to channel additional\r\nresources to rehabilitation projects. That would\r\nincrease employment and substantially reduce poverty.\r\nThe problem of combating poverty will remain, in the\r\nshort term, one of the priority tasks for the Government\r\nof Tajikistan. The targeted comprehensive programme\r\nthat is currently being implemented in the country\r\nenvisages, in particular, measures to create new jobs, to\r\nimprove primary education, to ease access to loans and\r\nmicrocredits, and, what is particularly important, to\r\nenhance the development of rural regions. We are\r\ncarefully studying the experience of other countries in\r\ncombating poverty. The progress made by some\r\nStates — in particular in China, our neighbour — is\r\nquite encouraging. However, the high level of external\r\nindebtedness of Tajikistan is a major obstacle in this\r\nregard. It also impedes post-conflict peace-building\r\nand poses a serious threat to social and economic\r\nstability in our country. We are convinced that in order\r\nto support the developing countries and economies in\r\ntransition in combating poverty it is important for the\r\ninternational community to become more dynamic and\r\nflexible in easing the debt burden for our countries.\r\nIn recent years we have witnessed an increasing\r\nnumber of major natural and industrial disasters,\r\nincluding hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and forest\r\nfires. Human casualties and material losses caused by\r\nthem have become a serious destabilizing factor. For\r\ntwo years running, Tajikistan has suffered as a result of\r\na large-scale drought, unprecedented in the twentieth\r\ncentury. One third of our cotton and grain crops was\r\ndestroyed by drought. Cattle farming and animal\r\nhusbandry products have sharply declined. Shortages\r\nof water, including fresh water, have increased. We\r\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General, to the\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies and donor\r\ncountries for their prompt and generous response to the\r\nappeal made by our President in connection with the\r\nunprecedented drought in the spring and summer of\r\nthis year. The concerted collective response of the\r\ninternational community to natural disasters is\r\nevidence of the increasing effectiveness of the\r\navailable international machinery in this regard. The\r\nUnited Nations has played an important role in\r\ndeveloping them. The outcome of the United Nations\r\nInternational Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction\r\nhas shown the need to increasingly use national\r\nopportunities and to enhance international cooperation\r\nin this field.\r\nIn the context of globalization, natural and\r\nindustrial disasters demand an appropriate global\r\nresponse. It is essential that the community of nations\r\nunite its efforts to prevent natural disasters and deal\r\nwith their consequences by training personnel and\r\nexchanging experience and the results of scientific and\r\napplied research. That would also allow coordinated\r\napproaches to such global challenges as the greenhouse\r\neffect, the depletion of the ozone layer, endangered\r\nbiodiversity and desertification. All these issues are\r\ndirectly linked to the problem of protecting the\r\nenvironment, a problem that is global by its very\r\nnature.\r\nAmong the environmental challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century, the problem of maintaining water\r\nequilibrium and access to fresh water is one of the most\r\nurgent. The population of earth is increasing, and the\r\nneed for fresh water is also increasing, while natural\r\nwater resources are not increasing. One out of six\r\npeople on earth does not have access to fresh water\r\ntoday. The danger of the world’s diminishing fresh\r\nwater resources is quite evident: it represents a threat\r\nto the environment and to all life on earth. This\r\ntendency is not becoming less acute, and therefore\r\nTajikistan, which possesses considerable water\r\nresources in Central Asia, greatly appreciates all efforts\r\nto deal with the problem of fresh water resources at all\r\nlevels throughout the world. We are pleased that the\r\ninitiative of the President of Tajikistan, Emomali\r\nRakhmonov, to proclaim 2003 the international year of\r\nfresh water has received wide-ranging support in the\r\ncommunity of nations. We believe that the preparation\r\nand holding of events dedicated to the international\r\nyear of fresh water, at both international and national\r\nlevels, will help us all to find answers to the global\r\nchallenges faced by mankind and to come closer to a\r\nsolution to the strategic problem of providing access to\r\nfresh water to every person on earth.\r\nWith the beginning of the new century, the\r\nnumber of problems faced by mankind has not\r\ndiminished. The entire history of the United Nations\r\nhas demonstrated that the best way to deal with\r\nproblems is through collective action, based on an\r\nagreed platform. We have such a platform: the\r\nMillennium Declaration adopted by our heads of State,\r\n40\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\non a basis of global consensus, in the autumn of 2000.\r\nThe task that lies before us, the United Nations, is to\r\nmobilize energy and resources to achieve our common\r\ngoals in meeting the challenges of globalization. The\r\npeoples of our planet believe in the effectiveness of our\r\nOrganization. We should not fail to meet their hopes\r\nand expectations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Serbini Ali, Chairman of the delegation\r\nof Brunei Darussalam.\r\nMr. Serbini (Brunei Darussalam): On behalf of\r\nHis Majesty’s Government, I should like to express\r\nonce again my warmest congratulations to the\r\nPresident on his election and our appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, President of\r\nthe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. I would\r\nalso like to congratulate the Secretary-General on his\r\nre-election. We are extremely pleased that he is\r\ncontinuing to serve the United Nations. The award of\r\nthis year’s Nobel Peace Prize is a fine tribute to his\r\nwork and to the United Nations agencies and workers\r\nin the field, who have served us all with such\r\ndedication to the principles of the Charter.\r\nSadly, of course, this comes at a time when their\r\nwork is perhaps more crucial than ever before. The\r\natrocities committed in the United States on 11\r\nSeptember have rightly received the absolute\r\ncondemnation of all civilized people. There is no\r\njustification for terrorism. As we have stated both\r\nindividually and in our regional associations, Brunei\r\nDarussalam will continue to do all it can to work\r\nclosely with the United States and all members of the\r\nSecurity Council to play its part in overcoming the\r\ndirect challenge that terrorism poses to the proper\r\nconduct of international affairs.\r\nThe existence of terrorism is, however, a grim\r\nreminder that the United Nations agenda, set over the\r\nlast half of the twentieth century, has yet to be\r\ncompleted. There are many unwelcome legacies from\r\nthe past 50 years. Though none justify acts of terror,\r\nmany offer justification for deep resentment and\r\nprofound despair. Perhaps the most apparent of all at\r\nthis time is the situation in Palestine, where the justice\r\nimplicit in the Security Council’s resolutions on\r\nPalestine is still denied to what is now a third\r\ngeneration of Palestinians. In this respect, we welcome\r\nthe recognition given by many world leaders, including\r\nthe President of the United States and the Prime\r\nMinister of the United Kingdom, to the principle of a\r\nPalestinian State. Brunei Darussalam hopes that all\r\nconcerned and interested parties involved in the Middle\r\nEast peace process will act with urgency in order to\r\nbring this about.\r\nAs we all know, dispelling feelings of past\r\ninjustice is an extremely difficult task. In essence, we\r\nbelieve it must involve new approaches to security. We\r\nbelieve all members of all regional associations have a\r\ncrucial role in this. Brunei Darussalam is trying to do\r\nthis through the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) Regional Forum in an approach that\r\nhas been taking shape over nearly a decade now. This\r\ninvolves all the nations of South-East Asia and our\r\npartners in North America, East Asia, Europe and\r\nOceania. We seek common understandings through\r\nconsultation and various confidence-building measures.\r\nMembers have recognized the complex nature of\r\nmodern conflict. They have accepted that its roots are\r\noften deep and intricately entwined. As elsewhere in\r\nthe world, it can be the result of long-standing\r\nterritorial claims, centuries-old animosities and\r\ninstinctive suspicions or conflicting ideologies. Or it\r\ncan be as basic as local land disputes or simple lack of\r\nbasic resources.\r\nWhatever the cause, however, the members\r\nbelieve the Forum is seeing signs of success. This year,\r\nfor example, it has been able to move things another\r\nstage forward and is now looking into the very\r\nchallenging area of preventive diplomacy. In short, the\r\nmembers see dialogue and consultation not as a series\r\nof meetings but as a process. As such, it may never\r\nend. In fact, in the long run, the process itself may\r\nindeed become the solution.\r\nThat, we think, is the framework within which the\r\nideas expressed at the Millennium Summit can be\r\npursued successfully. In short, we believe that the key\r\nto security today is the capacity to think locally,\r\nregionally and globally at the same time. To us this\r\nmeans that a positive, forward-looking United Nations\r\nis crucial. It is here that all these thoughts can truly\r\ncome together. It is here that all nations can renew and\r\nstrengthen the tolerance and friendship that are the real\r\nbuilding blocks of security.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nguyen Thanh Chau, Chairman of\r\nthe delegation of Viet Nam.\r\n41\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): I am\r\nagain the last speaker of the day, but I am happy\r\nbecause it gives me a little extra time to congratulate\r\nthe President on the effective manner in which he is\r\nconducting the work of the session, which gives us\r\nevery reason to believe that it will be steered to a\r\nfruitful conclusion.\r\nI wish also to extend our heartfelt condolences\r\nand sympathy to the families of the plane crash victims\r\nof yesterday. Let us pray that it had nothing to do with\r\nterrorist acts, as the tragic events of 11 September\r\nalone were more than enough to bring to the fore the\r\nfight against terrorism as one of the top priorities of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community.\r\nCognizant of the distinction between terrorism and the\r\nstruggle to exercise a people’s right to self-\r\ndetermination, Viet Nam persistently condemns\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, which\r\ntakes a heavy toll of innocent lives. We fully support\r\nthe international endeavour and cooperation to ensure\r\nworld peace, stability and security in full conformity\r\nwith the United Nations Charter and with fundamental\r\nprinciples of international law, particularly those\r\nrespecting national independence and sovereignty. No\r\nindividual country can go solo or have double\r\nstandards in this fight. While members of the\r\ninternational community must act in a responsible\r\nmanner by not tolerating, nurturing and/or supporting\r\nterrorists on their soil, they should also bring the\r\nterrorists to justice or extradite them to the country\r\nwhere their crimes were committed, so that they can be\r\nduly punished.\r\nThough combating international terrorism has\r\nbecome the pressing task of the day, it must not\r\novershadow the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nPoverty, the widened development gap, the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic, the deteriorating environment, regional\r\ntensions and conflicts, all point to the potential\r\ninstability of the world today, as mentioned by our\r\nleaders a year ago. The Summit Declaration, in\r\nreflecting the genuine wishes and resolve of the\r\nworld’s peoples, vigorously reconfirmed the values and\r\nprinciples of the Charter, defining the priority\r\nobjectives of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity for the years to come, thus becoming our\r\nplatform, our programme of action for the new\r\nmillennium. To implement the Declaration at the global\r\nlevel, the United Nations last year conducted numerous\r\nactivities, including the organization of a series of\r\nspecial sessions in the economic, social and security\r\nfields. The international organizations in the United\r\nNations system — such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) —\r\nare actively coordinating with nations to incorporate in\r\ntheir national programmes the specific objectives set\r\nforth in the Summit Declaration. This is a significant\r\nstart which should be further promoted, as the most\r\npressing challenge to us all is how to eradicate poverty\r\non a global scale. In this spirit we wish to congratulate\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who started his\r\nsecond term in office with the Nobel Peace Prize. We\r\nare fully convinced that the Secretary-General will\r\ncontinue to contribute to the cause of all nations and\r\npeoples.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of globalization\r\nspearheaded by the information technology revolution,\r\nthe other side of international political and economic\r\nlife has been further exposed. The gap between rich\r\nand poor has widened further, and adverse\r\ncircumstances in international relations have emerged,\r\nfurther underscoring the disadvantage and vulnerability\r\nof the developing countries. The Secretary-General\r\nonce said words to the effect that poverty and the gap\r\nbetween rich and poor are the seeds of instability and\r\nprecarious development, and that today’s main\r\nchallenge is how to ensure that globalization becomes\r\nthe driving force of development instead of leaving a\r\nbillion people in abject poverty. A common concern at\r\npresent, however, is the tendency towards decreasing\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA), particularly the\r\ndecrease in contributions to the development\r\norganizations in the United Nations system, which will\r\nsurely hamper their activities. More than ever before,\r\nthe United Nations, the international community, the\r\ndeveloped countries in particular, should further assist\r\nthe developing countries in the eradication of poverty,\r\ndisease and illiteracy, and facilitate their fuller and\r\nequitable participation in international economic life.\r\nDevelopment requires an environment of peace\r\nand stability. But complex implications arising from\r\nthe conflicts in some parts of the world and the\r\npossible intensification of an arms race, are not\r\nconducive to development at all. Of particular concern\r\nis the escalation of violence in the Middle East. We\r\njoin the community of world peoples calling for an\r\n42\r\nA/56/PV.51\r\nearly end to violence, the resumption of peaceful\r\nnegotiations for a just, long-lasting solution in which\r\nthe inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and the\r\nlegitimate rights of all parties concerned, would be\r\nguaranteed. By the same token, the embargoes imposed\r\nupon Cuba, Iraq and Libya, which cause untold\r\nsuffering to these peoples, should be lifted so as to\r\nenable them to concentrate their energy and efforts on\r\nnational reconstruction and development.\r\nThis year, South-East Asia has witnessed certain\r\ncomplex developments, but peace, stability and\r\ncooperation remain the burning aspiration of our\r\npeoples and continue to be the main tendency. The\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\r\ncountries are determined to build a zone of peace,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity and to coordinate efforts to\r\neffectively cope with regional and global challenges. In\r\nthat context, the success of the 34th Ministerial\r\nMeeting, the eighth ASEAN Regional Forum held in\r\nHanoi last August and the ASEAN Summit held in\r\nBrunei Darussalam in early November, all contributed\r\nto establishing priorities and effective measures for the\r\nfuture of this region. These meetings reaffirmed\r\nASEAN’s determination to further promote solidarity,\r\ncooperation, dialogue and mutual understanding within\r\nASEAN, and between ASEAN countries and their\r\ndialogue partners, especially China, Japan and the\r\nRepublic of Korea, for the peaceful settlement of their\r\ndifferences on the basis of respect for fundamental\r\nprinciples and norms of international law, particularly\r\nthose regarding consensus and non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of others. The Hanoi Declaration on\r\nNarrowing the Development Gap for Closer ASEAN\r\nIntegration and other important documents were\r\nadopted on confidence-building and the promotion of\r\nmutual understanding for peace and stability in South-\r\nEast Asia, as well as in Asia and the Pacific. They\r\nwelcomed the promising progress in the ASEAN-China\r\nconsultation regarding a code of conduct in the Eastern\r\nSea, reaffirming those principles of the 1992 ASEAN\r\nManila Declaration on the settlement of conflicting\r\nclaims of territorial sovereignty in the Eastern Sea. We\r\nsincerely hope that the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community, in line with the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, will deliver active support and assistance\r\nto the implementation of our regional cooperation for\r\npeace, stability and development in the region and\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIn the course of 15 years of rebuilding, Viet Nam\r\nhas recorded great achievements in all fields. The ninth\r\nParty Congress has drawn necessary lessons from our\r\nown experiences, reaffirmed our resolve to continue the\r\ncourse, stepping up industrialization and modernization\r\nprogrammes, and mapping out the socio-economic\r\ndevelopment strategy for the years 2001 to 2010. While\r\ntrying to bring into full play our inner strength, we will\r\ncreate more favourable conditions to attract investment\r\nand expand further effective cooperation with foreign\r\npartners and countries. We will continue to pursue our\r\nforeign policy of independence, openness, international\r\neconomic integration, friendship and trusted\r\npartnership with all countries in the international\r\ncommunity in the endeavour for peace, independence\r\nand development.\r\nThe Millennium Summit and its Declaration\r\nprovided us with a momentum in the new millennium,\r\nwhich should be maintained through the active\r\nimplementation of the guidelines unanimously\r\nendorsed by our leaders. The United Nations and each\r\nMember State should make efforts to achieve those\r\nobjectives.\r\nIn order to contribute effectively to the common\r\ncause, the United Nations should speed up the process\r\nof reform, renovation and democratization. Viet Nam\r\nfully supports the central role of the General Assembly,\r\nthe highest representative body of the whole\r\nmembership, and the reform and expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council in both the non-permanent and\r\npermanent categories. The developing countries should\r\nhave fuller representation and participation in the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making. But it is of the utmost\r\nimportance that the United Nations should design\r\nmeasures to concentrate resources for development and\r\nthe eradication of poverty and for the other major\r\nobjectives included in the Millennium Declaration. It is\r\nthe expectation of the whole membership that the\r\nUnited Nations should become a worthy world body,\r\noperating in a more effective manner in the interests of\r\nall countries and for a just, humanistic and better world\r\nin the new millennium. We believe that the United\r\nNations will surely live up to this expectation and Viet\r\nNam pledges to contribute actively to this common\r\nendeavour.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.\r\n"
