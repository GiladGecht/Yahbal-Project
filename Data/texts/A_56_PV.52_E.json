(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr., President\r\nof the Republic of Palau\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Palau.\r\nMr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr., President of the\r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr.,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Remengesau: Let me begin by\r\nconveying my deepest sympathy and condolences to\r\nthe families and relatives of the victims of American\r\nAirlines flight 587, which crashed in this great city two\r\ndays ago, exactly two months and one day after the 11\r\nSeptember terrorist attack. The people of New York are\r\nonce again being put to the test, and once again they\r\nwill come out of this tragedy more resolved and\r\ndetermined, under the leadership of Mayor Giuliani and\r\nGovernor Pataki. While we pray for the victims and\r\ntheir families, let us also pray that the crash, as tragic\r\nas it was, will prove to be an accident and not an act of\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn the wake of an unfathomable, barbarous act of\r\nterror against a civilian population made up of citizens\r\nfrom nations around the globe, we gather together in\r\nunprecedented unity. We are united in our sorrow over\r\nthe losses arising from 11 September — the loss of\r\nlives, the loss of friends and loved ones, the loss of\r\nlivelihoods and the loss of innocence, for want of a\r\nbetter word. We are united in our condemnation of the\r\nhorrific acts perpetrated by an isolated group of\r\nextremists who have no respect for human life. We are\r\nunited in our resolve that those responsible for the\r\natrocities of 11 September, and those who support\r\nthem, are a cancer in the body of nations — a systemic\r\nblight which extends beyond the individual\r\nperpetrators and which must be utterly eradicated, lest\r\nit return and spread.\r\nAt the same time, we are united in our conviction\r\nthat their evil cannot be allowed to force us to abandon\r\nrespect for human rights and adherence to the rule of\r\nlaw, which are fundamental principles of this\r\nOrganization. We are united in our recognition that, for\r\nall their claims to holiness, those responsible for these\r\ncriminal acts of terror bear no legitimate claim to any\r\ncivilized religion and certainly do not represent the\r\nnoble and honourable beliefs of Islam. We are united in\r\nour understanding that the peoples of Afghanistan are\r\nalso victims of the corruption and ill-fated control of\r\ntheir Government by these criminals and their\r\nsupporters, as well as in our desire to assist in\r\nimproving the quality of life of the people of\r\nAfghanistan. In all these things and more, we are\r\nunited to a degree that would have been unthinkable\r\nbefore 11 September.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nThis new spirit of cooperation reflects the most\r\npositive feature of globalization — the feature which\r\npro-globalization factions do not often put forward and\r\nanti-globalization forces never consider. It is the only\r\nfeature of globalization that Pacific island countries\r\nsuch as Palau can see as being truly and inherently\r\npositive — a feature that the Pacific island countries\r\nhave recognized among themselves for decades. That\r\nfeature is the acknowledgement that, ultimately, there\r\nis only one system in which we exist, and the related\r\nunderstanding that any act or condition within that\r\nsystem affects each of us, although in varying ways and\r\ndegrees. In such a system, problems are best addressed\r\nthrough coalition-building and a consensus-driven\r\napproach, a process of give and take, involving the\r\nwidest possible range of participants. We see proof of\r\nthis as the world continues to cooperate in responding\r\nto the 11 September attacks against humanity.\r\nAs I have said, in this new spirit of cooperation,\r\nthe process of decision-making and the implementation\r\nof those decisions must be as open and participatory as\r\npossible. This is especially true in the light of the need\r\nto weave together military, financial, law enforcement,\r\ntrade, intelligence-gathering and foreign aid issues. In\r\nthese troubled times, it simply makes no sense to\r\nisolate a proven ally in the fight against terrorism. Yet\r\nthat is what is happening. The Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan, which could and should be a very valuable\r\nasset in these and other cooperative actions, is\r\nsignificantly restricted in the role it can play because it\r\nhas been barred from membership in this body. In fact,\r\nit is the only nation in the world which has no voice in\r\nthis Organization.\r\nNot only is the exclusion of Taiwan contrary to\r\nthe fundamental, inclusive principles of the United\r\nNations, but on a more pragmatic level it compromises\r\nsecurity in Asia and the Pacific. Lacking a neutral\r\nforum for the non-violent, diplomatic resolution of any\r\ndisputes it might have with the People’s Republic of\r\nChina, the Republic of China on Taiwan is at a great\r\ndisadvantage in maintaining stable and peaceful\r\nrelations in the region. It is simply counterproductive,\r\nfrom either a practical or a political viewpoint, to\r\nexclude from this body a peaceful, democratically\r\ngoverned, economically vibrant nation which embraces\r\nhuman rights and plays a major role in other\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nSimilarly, it makes no sense, in this new global\r\nsystem, to ignore an entire bloc of nations because of\r\nperceptions left over from an earlier, colonial-era\r\nworld. Yet the Pacific island countries are still being\r\nmarginalized in the various United Nations bodies and\r\nprocesses. It is time to recognize that the Pacific island\r\ncountries are unique entities, island countries with\r\ndistinct traditions, cultures, needs, interests and\r\nconcerns and are not merely the leftovers of\r\ncolonialism. It is time to recognize that they are among\r\nthe youngest nations of the world, with special\r\nrequirements for assistance in assuming their proper\r\nplace in the global arena. Those needs, interests and\r\nconcerns are often overlooked against the larger\r\nbackdrop of the Asia-Pacific Group in the United\r\nNations. It is time to change that; to deal more fully\r\nwith the Pacific island countries as such, rather than as\r\nan afterthought tagged onto Asia.\r\nResolutions have been put forward which could\r\ncorrect the erroneous exclusion of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan, pave the way to providing a properly\r\nexpanded role for the Pacific island countries as such,\r\nand produce greater cooperation and broader support in\r\nall the key works of the United Nations. Now is the\r\ntime for the membership to adopt those resolutions in\r\nrecognition of the need for full participation of all\r\npeoples in the global events unfolding now and sure to\r\ndevelop in the foreseeable future.\r\nMoreover, it is equally important in this new\r\nglobalization and world order that the most important\r\norgan of the United Nations, the Security Council, be\r\nreorganized and restructured to reflect true\r\nrepresentation of this Organization. While we\r\ncommend and applaud the five permanent members of\r\nthe Security Council for their efforts and contributions\r\nto world peace and security, the time has come for this\r\nbody to consider the inclusion of several Member\r\nStates as permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nJapan, among few others, has certainly reached the\r\nlevel and capacity to be one of the permanent members\r\nof the Security Council. In this respect, we applaud the\r\nrecent decision of the Japanese Government to send\r\nsupport forces to the United States-led coalition war\r\nagainst international terrorism.\r\nFinally, if it can be said that any good came from\r\nthe abominations of 11 September, it would be this:\r\ncountries of the world that gave little thought to\r\nengagement and cooperation in a larger, global system\r\nare now fully engaged and working side by side with\r\ncountries to which they were formerly antagonistic or\r\nto which they gave only passing thought, at best. This\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nnew perspective can and should be applied to respond\r\nto another global attack, one that is even more basic\r\nthan terrorism and will remain a threat to humanity\r\nafter the criminals of 11 September are brought to\r\njustice.\r\nThis threat arises from the attack on our own\r\necosystem through desertification, through the\r\nreduction in global biodiversity and through global\r\nwarming and sea-level rise, all resulting from human\r\nactivities. These attacks, infinitely less dramatic than\r\nthose of 11 September, are nonetheless equally\r\nsystemic in nature and equally threatening to us all. It\r\nis time to apply the same new understanding of global\r\ndynamics, so forcefully driven home on 11 September,\r\nto our environment.\r\nWe applaud and are very much encouraged by the\r\ndevelopments of the recently concluded seventh\r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in\r\nMorocco. To that end, I want to repeat my oft-stated\r\ncall for all nations to finalize negotiations on, sign,\r\nratify and implement the Kyoto Protocol as soon as\r\npossible. Just as we must now directly confront the\r\neffects of transnational acts of terror, we must now\r\ndirectly confront the environmental consequences of\r\nour own actions. Delay on either matter is unacceptable\r\nand will only further compromise our well-being.\r\nFor perhaps the first time in its glorious history,\r\nthe phrase “United Nations” literally describes this\r\nOrganization. While we remain shocked, saddened and\r\ndeeply offended by the events giving rise to the new\r\nunity, we must acknowledge and nurture whatever\r\ngood those events can be turned to. We now have the\r\nability to see the clear advantages of close cooperation\r\non matters which affect us all. Let us use the\r\nknowledge, that wisdom gained from pain, and forge\r\neven stronger, institutional reliance on cooperation,\r\nconsensus and coalition-building across the widest\r\npossible constituency as we go forward in this new\r\nglobal system.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Palau for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tommy Remengesau, Jr., President of the\r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. María Eugenia Brizuela de Ávila,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of El Salvador.\r\nMrs. Brizuela de Ávila (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\npreside over the General Assembly at this session and\r\nwish you every success in fulfilling your mandate. Our\r\nappreciation also goes to Mr. Harri Holkeri for his\r\nwork at the last session.\r\nWe wish to convey to our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, our sincerest congratulations on his\r\nunanimous re-election for a second term as leader of\r\nthis Organization in a broad acknowledgement of his\r\nabilities, leadership and firm resolve to promote the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, which have\r\nbeen rightly recognized with the awarding to him and\r\nthe United Nations of the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThe delegation of El Salvador believes that the\r\ndeplorable and irrational terrorist attacks on the people\r\nand Government of the United States, which we\r\nrepudiated and condemned at the time and do so again\r\nin this forum, have made it plain that terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations is a grave threat to peace,\r\nfreedom and democracy. Given the special nature of\r\nthat scourge, it is essential that we unite our wills and\r\npool our efforts to combat and eradicate it.\r\nThese acts of terrorism have affected us all\r\ndirectly, because they represent an assault on\r\ncivilization, which is based on the values and\r\nprinciples embodied in the Charter of the Organization.\r\nIndeed, such acts affect not only international peace\r\nand security, but also the growth and development of\r\nour economies. In view of all this, the countries\r\nrepresented here should not allow minority groups to\r\ncrush our peoples’ democratic spirit or to sow\r\npermanent uncertainty and fear by means of violence\r\nand threats directed against the most fundamental\r\nprinciples of human coexistence.\r\nIt is precisely the norms of human coexistence\r\nthat underpin and sustain peace, freedom and\r\ndevelopment for humanity, regardless of ideology,\r\nculture, race or religion. We concur with many\r\ndelegations that the struggle against terrorism should\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nnot be considered, much less interpreted, as a struggle\r\namong civilizations or nations.\r\nPursuant to the decisions taken by the\r\ninternational community, the Government of El\r\nSalvador is taking the proper steps to fulfil the\r\nprovisions articulated in the pertinent resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly and other\r\nmeasures decided upon at the regional and continental\r\nlevel. It is appropriate to mention that at the Central\r\nAmerican level, the Security Commission has adopted\r\nan ambitious programme of action so that we can work\r\ntogether to combat terrorism.\r\nWith respect to our national situation, on a\r\nnumber of occasions we have reiterated the\r\ncommitment and political resolve of the Government of\r\nEl Salvador to tackle effectively the challenges of\r\nbuilding sustainable human development. We have\r\nmade much progress in the last decade.\r\nHowever, as everyone knows, this year began\r\nwith serious natural disasters. The two earthquakes in\r\nJanuary and February shook the very foundations of\r\nSalvadoran society, since 25 per cent of the population\r\nwas affected, and losses amounted to 13 per cent of the\r\ngross domestic product. The devastating effects of the\r\nearthquakes extended into the economic and social\r\nspheres, obliging us to implement an emergency\r\nprogramme, which meant changing and adapting the\r\nGovernment’s plan to match the new priorities,\r\nredirecting the State’s limited financial resources to\r\nreconstruction. This was compounded by an\r\nunprecedented drop in international coffee prices, our\r\nmajor export commodity. We also suffered a\r\nwidespread drought, affecting agricultural production,\r\nwhich is the unpinning of our economy.\r\nThus we believe that it is essential to reiterate our\r\nspecial recognition of and gratitude to all the countries\r\nand international organizations that provided us with\r\nvaluable assistance during these natural disasters. I\r\nwish to thank in particular the World Food Programme\r\nfor its effective work in relieving the food-supply\r\nproblems of large sectors of the population affected by\r\nthe drought.\r\nIt is of the utmost importance to the Government\r\nof El Salvador to refer on this occasion to something\r\nthat has marked a turning point in the history of our\r\nnation and which, at the same time, represents a\r\nsuccess for United Nations peacekeeping operations:\r\nthe first multidisciplinary mission to resolve an internal\r\nconflict, as was the case in El Salvador.\r\nI wish to highlight, with great satisfaction, that 16\r\nJanuary 2002 will mark 10 years since the historic\r\nsigning of the El Salvador Peace Agreements, which\r\nformally ended the armed conflict that had wreaked\r\nhavoc in our society for 12 years. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral participated actively and played an important\r\nrole as intermediary in the process of negotiation and\r\nin the verification of the parties’ compliance with all\r\nthe commitments they had undertaken.\r\nSince that date, we have engaged in a process that\r\nwe can divide into two phases — first, the transition\r\nfrom war to peace, and second, the transition from\r\npeace to democracy. During the process we have made\r\ngreat efforts to fulfil the commitments of the\r\nAgreements in order to achieve peace, democracy,\r\nrespect for and protection of human rights, national\r\nreconciliation and reunification of Salvadoran society,\r\nand we have achieved qualitative changes in these\r\nareas.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador, as a signatory\r\nparty deeply interested in faithful observance of the\r\nAgreements, has been gratified to see the success\r\nachieved in executing these undertakings, putting into\r\npractice a constructive policy that has enabled us to\r\ndeal with sensitive and complex issues. The members\r\nof the international community, especially the donor\r\ncountries and the United Nations, can attest to this.\r\nIn fulfilling the Peace Agreements, all\r\nSalvadorans shouldered the obligations with the\r\nseriousness and responsibility that were required,\r\nmindful of the solemn significance and the implications\r\nof such fulfilment for the aspirations and expectations\r\nthat the Agreement outlined, both domestic and vis-à-\r\nvis the international community. This is why we are\r\nvery pleased that in fulfilling our obligations we have\r\nnot betrayed the trust of those that showed us solidarity\r\nand supported us throughout the process.\r\nNow more than ever, new possibilities are\r\nopening up for all sectors of the country — with a\r\nvision of being a nation — to face the future with a\r\nsense of shared responsibility, and for us to undertake\r\nthe new challenges involved in continuing to bolster\r\ndemocracy and promoting economic and social\r\ndevelopment. Consequently, we are committed to the\r\nprocess of modernizing and strengthening democratic\r\ninstitutions in conformity with the strategy of\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nsustainable development, whose focus and destiny are\r\nto improve the quality of life of each and every\r\nSalvadoran.\r\nIn a globalized and interdependent world, any\r\nsituation that affects the economy of the industrialized\r\ncountries and those with emerging economies has a\r\nsignificant impact on the conditions in the remainder of\r\nthe countries of the international community. The trend\r\ntowards a slowdown in these economies becomes\r\ndisquieting for our countries because of its adverse\r\neffects on fostering economic progress and maintaining\r\nsocial stability.\r\nIn this regard, it is essential to pay attention to the\r\nproblems besetting the international economic order\r\nand prevent them from spreading and becoming causes\r\nthat generate fresh conflict, especially in the\r\ndeveloping countries. For this reason, we hope that the\r\noutcome of the meeting of the World Trade\r\nOrganization in Doha will be beneficial for the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIt is appropriate to note that during the\r\nparticipation of the President of El Salvador, Francisco\r\nFlores, in the Group of Eight Summit in Genoa, Italy,\r\non 10 June, he voiced the anxiety and concerns that we\r\nfeel about the serious problems that exist and stated our\r\naspirations as developing countries to promote the\r\nprogress of our peoples. On that occasion, President\r\nFlores noted that we do not want handouts or\r\nconcessions based on paternalistic approaches. We\r\nwant to become partners in development and achieve\r\nmutual benefits so that we have the opportunity to\r\ngradually improve our conditions and have better\r\naccess to and derive greater benefit from international\r\nmarkets.\r\nIn El Salvador, we have put into practice a\r\nnumber of measures concerning the free market and\r\npromotion of foreign investment. They have led to\r\ninternationally recognized economic openness, which\r\nin practice has included a process of privatization,\r\nespecially in the communications, energy and finance\r\nsectors and in the area of social security, enhancing our\r\npotential for growth and development.\r\nAt the beginning of this year, as part of a gradual\r\nprocess that will lead finally to the elimination of the\r\nnational currency, the Government of El Salvador\r\nenacted the Monetary Integration Act, establishing the\r\ndollar as the unit of account in the financial system.\r\nThis will facilitate our trading and financial integration\r\nand further improve conditions for national and foreign\r\ninvestment and access to international financial\r\nsources.\r\nIn the area of trade, in addition to having a free-\r\ntrade relationship with our fraternal Central American\r\ncountries, we have extended our ties with Mexico, the\r\nDominican Republic and Chile, establishing free-trade\r\ntreaties with them, while others are in the process of\r\nbeing negotiated with Panama and Canada.\r\nAt the same time, we are making an effort to\r\nstrengthen the process of the Central American\r\nIntegration System (SICA), where we have taken\r\nsignificant steps, including customs activities and a\r\nregional proposal to modernize and transform Central\r\nAmerica. The proposal’s strategic projects for\r\ndevelopment were presented this year to the\r\nConsultative Group in Madrid. The implementation of\r\nthe Puebla-Panama Plan, in which Central America is\r\npartnered with Mexico for its development, is part of\r\nthese efforts.\r\nIn general, we can say that, given the trend\r\ntowards globalization, which marks modern\r\ninternational relations, and despite the difficulties and\r\ncomplexities involved, our country is doing its utmost\r\nto take advantage of the phenomenon. In this regard,\r\nthe least that we can hope is that there will be good\r\nwill and political resolve on the part of the developed\r\ncountries to grant us solidarity and support to enable us\r\nto become effectively incorporated in the process.\r\nIn view of the importance of the commitment\r\nassumed by the heads of State and Government in the\r\nMillennium Declaration of the United Nations, we note\r\nthat the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Mexico, and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development will provide\r\nopportunities to demonstrate the solidarity and\r\ncooperation of the international community,\r\nparticularly on the part of the developed countries, by\r\nthe adoption of appropriate measures conducive to\r\nachieving fair and equitable development, especially in\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nWith respect to other sensitive issues for the\r\ninternational community, the Government of El\r\nSalvador views with concern the continuation or\r\nworsening of certain problems that, if not resolved,\r\nwill be a threat to international peace and security.\r\nThese include the ongoing conflict in the Middle East,\r\nwhich is a source of great concern, especially because\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nduring the past year we have seen unremitting violence,\r\nleading to the irreparable loss of human life and\r\nmaterial and economic damage in the region, and to a\r\nconstant increase in the suffering of the Israeli and\r\nPalestinian peoples.\r\nIn that context, the Government of El Salvador\r\nreiterates its support for all efforts and measures aimed\r\nat achieving a negotiated political solution that takes\r\ninto account the interests of the parties directly\r\ninvolved, in order to achieve a firm and lasting peace.\r\nThe State of Israel’s right to exist and to live within\r\nsecure borders, as well as the inalienable right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to\r\nestablish its own State, are basic preconditions for\r\nachieving peace, which will enable the leaders of the\r\nregion to devote themselves to promoting the progress\r\nand well-being of their peoples.\r\nThe extraordinary situation of the Republic of\r\nChina in Taiwan is a case that the international\r\ncommunity should examine, particularly in the light of\r\nthe most recent changes in the international system.\r\nRegarding the strengthening of the world\r\nOrganization, it is important that this opportunity not\r\nbe lost to address an item of priority interest for all\r\nMember States: Security Council reform. In this\r\nregard, we must emphasize the commitments contained\r\nin the Millennium Declaration so that this reform can\r\nbe carried out. In that regard, we urge the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group established for this purpose to redouble\r\nits efforts so that those commitments will be fulfilled\r\nand so that we can achieve, on the basis of flexible\r\npositions, a general agreement on the issue.\r\nFinally, given the complex and uncertain\r\ninternational situation, we urge all Governments,\r\ngroups and sectors of civil society to reflect on the\r\nimperative importance of working together in a spirit\r\nof human solidarity that will enable us to overcome all\r\ndifferences that separate us in order to achieve great\r\nglobal objectives that could not be achieved on an\r\nindividual basis, with a view to attaining the spiritual\r\nand physical peace to which all nations aspire.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Mr. Ram Sharan Mahat,\r\nMinister for Finance of Nepal.\r\nMr. Mahat (Nepal): At the outset, I wish to\r\nexpress, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government and\r\nthe people of Nepal, and on my own behalf, our\r\nprofound condolences to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States, as well as to the families\r\nwho lost their loved ones in the unfortunate crash of\r\nAmerican Airlines flight 587 on 12 November.\r\nLet me congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\r\nwell-deserved election to steer the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. My felicitations also go to the\r\nother members of the Bureau.\r\nI also congratulate the Secretary-General on his\r\nelection to a second term and on being awarded this\r\nyear’s Nobel Peace Prize, together with the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe are meeting against the backdrop of the 11\r\nSeptember terrorist attacks that took innumerable lives\r\nand caused colossal damage in our host country and\r\nhost city. The Nepalese people express their full\r\nsolidarity with the American people in this hour of\r\ngrief and support the American-led war on terror.\r\nThe horror’s powerful ripples have been felt\r\nbeyond the borders of the United States, around the\r\nworld. They have pushed the already slumping global\r\neconomy into a recession that is sure to unleash misery\r\nand starvation on millions of people and kill thousands\r\nof children in the developing world.\r\nIn the wake of the terrorist onslaught, the United\r\nNations was quick to act. It approved fresh measures,\r\nincluding Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\ncalling on Member States to stem the terrorists’\r\nchannels of communication, freeze their finances, deny\r\nthem refuge and support, strengthen domestic and\r\ninternational law against them and collectively take all\r\nnecessary measures to prevent and defeat them.\r\nA broad coalition of States united around a\r\ncommon goal has launched a global campaign against\r\nterrorism. Itself being a victim of terrorist activities,\r\nwhich have taken nearly 1,800 lives over the past five\r\nyears and have grossly undermined development\r\nefforts, Nepal fully understands the challenges and cost\r\nof defeating this elusive enemy that has no borders, no\r\nterritory and no standing army. Yet with collective\r\nresolve and determination and with preventive and\r\ncurative actions we can sniff out the forces of\r\nterrorism, if we only refrain from political expediency\r\nand moral relativism.\r\nEnforcing all the existing relevant conventions\r\nand resolutions is as crucial as the early conclusion of a\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism in order to\r\nachieve the objective.\r\nThe twenty-first century begins with a new and\r\nuncertain security environment. No sooner had we put\r\nthe wars, and the cold war, of the last century behind us\r\nand had begun to grapple with internal conflicts than\r\nterrorism emerged as a grave threat to international\r\npeace and security. It should be tackled decisively and\r\nwithout delay.\r\nAs we engage in the war on terrorism, we must\r\nnot forget that the edifice of durable peace can be\r\nerected only on the fundamental pillars of the\r\nprevention of conflicts, the peaceful resolution of\r\ndisputes, persistent efforts for disarmament, poverty\r\nreduction and development, and respect for diversity,\r\nfairness and justice. The culture of peace and dialogue\r\nshould advance the process.\r\nWe now live in a global village where all are\r\ninterdependent. A fire in one house may consume the\r\nentire village if left unchecked. That is why concerted\r\nefforts to secure peace and stability are critical in the\r\ntroubled nations of Africa, Asia, Europe and elsewhere\r\nthat have suffered wanton instability and violence that\r\nare pernicious for their national integrity, social\r\nharmony and economic progress.\r\nIn particular, we will have to end the cycle of\r\nviolence and death in the Middle East by finding a\r\ndurable solution to its festering problem. The war on\r\nterror and the restoration of stability will succeed in\r\nAfghanistan if its people are saved from starvation and\r\nunwarranted hardship now and assured of their\r\ncountry’s reconstruction when the struggle is over.\r\nCriminal acts such as those involving the present\r\nanthrax scare in the United States and the use of sarin\r\ngas in the Tokyo subway a few years back are strong\r\ntestimony to the necessity of abolishing biological and\r\nchemical weapons before an appalling catastrophe\r\nbefalls us. More importantly, the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons and the increasing likelihood of their\r\nuse by terrorists, viewed in the context of the\r\nsuccessful 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons, constitute compelling reasons to follow the\r\npath of complete and general nuclear disarmament.\r\nThe inability of the Conference on Disarmament\r\nto agree on its programme of work for the past several\r\nyears raises serious doubts about our commitment to\r\ndisarmament. That forum should be activated without\r\ndelay and should be tasked with negotiating new\r\ndisarmament treaties, including one on nuclear\r\ndisarmament, and to strengthen the existing ones.\r\nIn order for United Nations peace efforts to\r\nbecome instrumental in promoting global peace, Nepal\r\nhas lent them moral backing, has contributed nearly\r\n40,000 troops and has sustained 42 casualties in the\r\nline of duty. Nepal is willing to work for the\r\nimprovement of peacekeeping operations, taking into\r\naccount both the Brahimi Panel report and our\r\ncollective experience.\r\nWhile we are preoccupied with the immediate\r\nsteps against terrorists, we must not overlook or\r\nabandon other equally pressing issues central to\r\ndurable peace, such as the need to remove poverty,\r\ncreate jobs and provide education, drinking water,\r\nhealth and other basic services in poor countries. The\r\nreason is simple: terrorists and anarchists often exploit\r\nthe vulnerabilities of the impoverished, the\r\nunemployed, the excluded and the disaffected to carry\r\nout their sinister designs.\r\nOf course, poor countries have no choice but to\r\nundertake painful reforms to improve their governance\r\nand performance. Decreasing assistance to the poor in\r\nthe face of increasing prosperity in the rich countries\r\ndefies our understanding. Therefore, it is equally\r\nurgent and essential that they receive increased support\r\nfrom their development partners.\r\nFor example, rich countries need to reverse the\r\ndecline in development assistance and meet the aid\r\ntargets, fully fund and expand the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Initiative to cover all least\r\ndeveloped and worst affected countries and facilitate\r\ninvestment in the South. Their trade barriers ought to\r\nbe dismantled and markets opened to spur exports and\r\nhelp to broaden the production capacities of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nAs the advanced nations seek to hammer out a\r\nstimulus package to extricate their economies from the\r\ndark shadow of the present economic downturn, they\r\nmust also be mindful of the much greater needs of\r\npoorer nations at this time of economic hardship.\r\nUndoubtedly, all developing countries face\r\nserious obstacles to their development journey. But\r\nlandlocked developing countries suffer from the\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nadditional impediments of remoteness, transit-transport\r\ndifficulties and lack of access to sea-based resources.\r\nHowever, nowhere are the trauma of deprivation\r\nand dispossession and problems of development more\r\nstaggering than in the least developed countries,\r\nvirtually all of which are in Africa and Asia.\r\nGlobalization has further marginalized them, and the\r\ninformation revolution has hardly touched them. The\r\nUnited Nations special programmes of the past two\r\ndecades have apparently been inadequate and unable to\r\nmake a difference, as many of these countries have\r\nbecome increasingly worse off over the last decade.\r\nNepal is committed to vigorously implementing\r\nthe outcome of the Third United Nations Conference\r\non the Least Developed Countries. We sincerely hope\r\nthat our development partners will leave no stone\r\nunturned in carrying out their commitments, including\r\nthe European Union’s “everything but arms” scheme.\r\nConflicts and chaos, and deprivation and disasters\r\ncontinue to spawn humanitarian problems and to create\r\nsituations in which human rights are compromised.\r\nToday there are 22 million refugees, including 100,000\r\nin Nepal, and many more internally displaced persons\r\naround the globe. Responding to such exigencies is\r\nnaturally a priority, as is the war on terror, but we must\r\nbear in mind that humanitarian assistance cannot\r\nprevent the recurrence of crises until people are\r\nempowered and their vulnerabilities addressed.\r\nI should like to take this occasion to thank the\r\ninternational community for its support in the\r\nmaintenance of refugees in Nepal. We urge it to\r\ncontinue its assistance until the problem is resolved,\r\nleading to their repatriation. To this end, we are\r\nengaged in dialogue with the Government of the\r\nKingdom of Bhutan.\r\nThe need has never been so urgent to protect\r\nrefugees, maintain ecological balance, preserve the\r\nenvironment, promote sustainable development and\r\nensure that this planet remains at least as liveable for\r\nour children as it has been for us. The strengthening of\r\nexisting global treaties on the environment, and\r\nparticularly the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, is\r\nurgently required.\r\nNepal, a least developed and landlocked nation,\r\nhas accorded its topmost priority to poverty reduction,\r\nspending more than 70 per cent of its budget in rural\r\nareas where the poorest people live, and has adopted a\r\nmarket-led development policy with a two-pronged\r\nstrategy.\r\nPolicies and measures have been instituted to\r\nattract foreign investment and to harness people’s\r\ncreative potential by means of economic liberalization,\r\ninvestment incentives, decentralization and the\r\nrationalization of public spending priorities. Of late, we\r\nhave taken steps towards land reform, the\r\nempowerment of women through education,\r\ninheritance rights and political participation, together\r\nwith special developmental programmes to assist weak\r\nand vulnerable people and regions.\r\nYet progress has been slow in coming, with the\r\nattendant serious consequences. Nepal’s per capita\r\ngross national product of $220 is one of the lowest in\r\nthe world; 38 per cent of the population lives below the\r\npoverty line; and the ratio of the Government’s foreign\r\ndebt stock to government revenue is 410 per cent, and\r\nto annual exports, 350 per cent. These statistics are\r\nincredibly disheartening, even among the least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nDespite this, Nepal is left out of the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. I therefore\r\nurge the donor community to include Nepal in the\r\nInitiative to help release our resources from debt-\r\nservicing obligations, which will enable us to\r\nimplement poverty-reduction programmes more\r\neffectively. But this will in no way substitute for the\r\nneed for increased development assistance.\r\nThe United Nations has an elemental role to play\r\nin meeting all these challenges. To prepare it to address\r\nthem, Nepal believes that we should revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and augment cooperation and coordination\r\namong the various United Nations organs. Likewise,\r\nwe deem it imperative to enlarge the Security Council\r\nand to improve its methods of work, including through\r\nthe deepening of its cooperation with troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nVeto power militates against the basic tenets of\r\nequality and democracy; it reflects the realities of a\r\nbygone era. Nepal is convinced of the necessity to do\r\naway with the veto and understands the profound\r\ndifficulty of achieving this goal. Until it has been\r\neliminated, this power ought to be rationalized by\r\ndefining the parameters for its application.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nThe Millennium Declaration has given us a vision\r\nof and benchmarks for a peaceful, decent, just and\r\nviable global society, and it has indicated how the\r\nUnited Nations could be instrumental in achieving\r\nthem. It is our collective obligation to implement them,\r\nsharing the burdens and benefits equally. Nepal\r\nwelcomes the road map for the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe implementation review of various global\r\ncompacts has unmistakably established a shortage of\r\nfinancial resources as the principal reason for lack of\r\nprogress. Nepal hopes that the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development and the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nnext year, will do their best to chalk out a blueprint for\r\nfinancing developmental activities, which is the\r\nforemost concern of the developing world.\r\nAs regional cooperation is an effective vehicle for\r\nbroadening markets and production as well as for\r\nbuilding collective competitiveness, Nepal and other\r\nSouth Asian countries have been working together\r\nunder the umbrella of the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC). I am happy to inform\r\nthe Assembly that Nepal will have the privilege of\r\nhosting its next summit in January 2002, following its\r\npostponement two years ago.\r\nAgain, in the spirit of regional solidarity and of\r\nits abiding commitment to peace and disarmament,\r\nNepal looks forward to the early relocation of the\r\nRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia\r\nand the Pacific to Kathmandu, where it belongs. We\r\nhave, on our part, completed all necessary preparations\r\nfor the effective functioning of the Centre from Nepal.\r\nDemocracy, development and human rights are\r\nintegral to society’s advancement. Therefore, Nepal is\r\nengaged in promoting democracy and freedom, and\r\nhuman rights and justice for all, particularly women,\r\nchildren and vulnerable groups. We cherish these\r\nvalues, which are crucial to preserving human dignity\r\nand to bestowing on human beings the opportunity to\r\nreach their full potential.\r\nIn the aftermath of the agonizing royal massacre\r\nin Nepal early this year, our people’s faith in\r\ndemocracy has been further reinforced, as it ensured a\r\nsmooth succession and stability in the face of a terrible\r\ncrisis. I thank all our friends for their solidarity and\r\nsupport at a time of national tragedy in Nepal.\r\nWe have witnessed unprecedented unity among\r\nnations in fighting major wars in the past, and\r\nterrorism at present. If we show the same kind of\r\nresolve and dedication, we can successfully fight\r\npoverty, deprivation and discrimination. The United\r\nNations should brace itself to face them effectively, and\r\nMember States should assume a greater sense of\r\nresponsibility. Nepal, committed as it is to the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations, will\r\ncontinue to do its best to help it achieve its goals and to\r\nmake a difference in our people’s lives.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in Lao; English text provided by the\r\ndelegation): On behalf of the delegation of the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, allow me to join\r\nprevious speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your\r\nwell-deserved election to preside over the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. It is a tribute to the\r\nimportant contributions your country, the Republic of\r\nKorea, has made throughout the past years to the work\r\nof our Organization.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis outstanding and effective leadership of our\r\nOrganization. The prestigious Nobel Peace Prize\r\nconferred on him is both a recognition of his personal\r\nachievements and an affirmation of the great and\r\nlegitimate mission undertaken by the United Nations.\r\nWe wish him well and much success in his second term\r\nas head of the United Nations during the next five\r\nyears.\r\nThe general debate of the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly was not able to proceed as\r\nplanned, as a result of the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember, which caused thousands of deaths. In the\r\nwake of this tragic event, the Government of the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic condemned the terrorist\r\nacts while reaffirming its consistent policy of\r\ncooperating with the international community in the\r\nfight against terrorism in all its forms. In this respect,\r\nin late October, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\ndecided to become party to five international\r\nconventions on the fight against terrorism.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nThis tragedy has generated a set of ensuing\r\nevents. The Government of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic views the current situation with\r\ngreat concern and considers that it is high time that our\r\nOrganization played a growing role, in conformity with\r\nthe United Nations Charter, in the combat against\r\nterrorism and for the peace and security of the peoples\r\nof the world.\r\nSince its inception, the United Nations has made\r\nan important contribution to the maintenance of world\r\npeace and international security, as well as to\r\ncooperation and development in all areas of human\r\nendeavour. Last year, at the historic Summit, the world\r\nleaders reaffirmed the relevance and importance of our\r\nOrganization in the new, globalized world. At that\r\nsame Summit, we also pledged our commitment to\r\nensuring that the United Nations adapts to new areas\r\nand strengthens its capacity to deal with the challenges\r\nof maintaining world peace and promoting the\r\ndevelopment of all countries.\r\nSeveral issues inherited from the last century\r\nfailed to be addressed. Although the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform has spared\r\nno effort to fully carry out its mandate, the key issues\r\nof the reform of the Council remain unsettled.\r\nTherefore, we reaffirm our position in favour of the\r\nexpansion of both the permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council. Equally, we\r\nsupport the efforts to address the issue of the right of\r\nveto and to find a solution acceptable to all Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East has recently\r\nreached levels of increased violence, causing loss of\r\nlife, destruction, damage to property and deep sorrow\r\nand a desire for revenge among both the Palestinian\r\nand Israeli peoples. The Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic reaffirms its support for the establishment of\r\nan independent Palestinian State and for respect for\r\nIsrael’s right to existence. That would contribute to\r\nguaranteeing long-lasting peace and security in the\r\nMiddle East.\r\nAlmost every year, the General Assembly has\r\noverwhelmingly adopted a resolution on lifting the\r\ncommercial and economic embargo against the\r\nRepublic of Cuba. However, those resolutions have not\r\nbeen effectively implemented. The Government of the\r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic appeals to the\r\nUnited States and Cuba to jointly reach a rapid solution\r\nin the interest of the peoples of the two countries,\r\nwhich would contribute to promoting peace and\r\ndevelopmental cooperation in the region and the world.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula, several events have\r\nmarked the progress made towards the unification of\r\nKorea, such as meetings and exchanges of visits of\r\nleaders at all levels, reunions of families long kept\r\napart and humanitarian assistance. The Lao\r\nGovernment has followed these developments closely\r\nand commends the positive results. Nevertheless, we\r\nare deeply concerned about the situation prevailing in\r\nthe region and hope that under the wise guidance of the\r\nleaders of the two countries, the peaceful unification of\r\nan independent Korea will be achieved so as to meet\r\nthe fervent aspirations of the Korean people and to\r\ncontribute to peace, stability and cooperation in East\r\nAsia and throughout the world.\r\nIn South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific region,\r\nseveral outstanding activities to promote peace and\r\ncooperation have gained prominence in the region and\r\nthroughout the world. In Hanoi, the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum\r\nreaffirmed the importance of preventive diplomacy,\r\nconfidence-building measures and avoiding military\r\nconfrontation. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\n(APEC) meeting in China was a historic rally of unity\r\nin the fight against terrorism and in setting goals for\r\neconomic recovery. The Summit of ASEAN members\r\nplus China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, held in\r\nBrunei early this month, stressed the need to combat\r\nterrorism in all its forms, overcome economic recession\r\nand promote development cooperation.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic notes\r\nwith satisfaction that the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, held in\r\nMay this year, adopted a more realistic plan of action\r\nto enable the least developed countries to emerge\r\ndecisively from abject poverty and be integrated into\r\nthe global economic system. We very much hope that\r\nthe international community will make joint efforts to\r\nachieve the development objectives enunciated in that\r\nplan of action.\r\nFor many years now, the international community\r\nhas recognized that the landlocked developing\r\ncountries are one of the three vulnerable and\r\ndisadvantaged groups of developing countries. Their\r\nvulnerable and disadvantaged condition is attributed to\r\nlack of access to the sea, remoteness from world\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nmarkets and prohibitive transport costs, averaging 14\r\nper cent of export earnings, compared to only 8.8 per\r\ncent for other developing countries.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, in its\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Group of Landlocked\r\nDeveloping Countries, would like to appeal the General\r\nAssembly to endorse the recommendation made by the\r\nfifth Meeting of Governmental Experts from\r\nLandlocked and Transit Developing Countries and the\r\ndonor community to convene in 2003 an international\r\nministerial meeting of landlocked and transit\r\ndeveloping countries and the donor community on\r\ntransport cooperation, with the objective of addressing\r\nthe special problems and needs of the landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries. In this connection, we wish to\r\nwelcome the Government of Kazakhstan’s offer to host\r\nthe meeting.\r\nBy the end of 2000, there were 36.1 million\r\npeople worldwide who had tested HIV-positive, of\r\nwhom 90 per cent live in developing countries. It is our\r\nhope that the international community will take\r\nnecessary drastic measures, including through the\r\nprovision of additional and sustained resources, to\r\nimplement the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, adopted during the last special session of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nAnother issue of global concern is narcotic drugs.\r\nThe production and abuse of drugs have increased and\r\nhave become a cause of crime affecting many social\r\ndimensions. Realizing their own responsibilities,\r\nASEAN Governments and China convened an\r\ninternational conference in October 2000 in Thailand,\r\nwhere a plan of action to make ASEAN a drug-free\r\nzone by 2015 was adopted. Also, a ministerial meeting\r\nbetween four countries — China, Laos, Myanmar and\r\nThailand — was held in August this year with the\r\nobjective of curbing drug production and trade and the\r\nimporting of chemical precursors in the subregion.\r\nIn an effort to achieve the goals established by\r\nthe Political Declaration of the General Assembly\r\nspecial session held in 1998 and to fully eradicate\r\nopium production, the Government of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic has mobilized the people and,\r\ntogether with donors and international organizations,\r\nhas taken various measures through tailoring projects\r\ninvolving crop substitution, preventive education,\r\ndrug-addiction rehabilitation and law enforcement. As\r\na result, in the course of just three years, between 1998\r\nand 2000, opium-cultivated areas have been reduced\r\nfrom 26,000 hectares in 1998 to 17,000 hectares in\r\n2000. The aggregate opium production has also\r\ndeclined from 140 tons to 117 tons for the same period.\r\nMoreover, on 12 October 2001, the Lao Government\r\nlaunched a National Anti-Narcotic Campaign, chaired\r\nby the Prime Minister, with a view to ensuring that\r\nLaos is a drug-free country with a social order and a\r\nbright future for the next generation.\r\nIn general, over the last year, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic has enjoyed firm political\r\nstability and progressive development in all sectors,\r\nespecially in food security. All this was reflected in the\r\nsolemn celebration of the twenty-fifth founding\r\nanniversary of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nand the successful conclusion of the Seventh Congress\r\nof the Lao People’s Revolutionary Party. These historic\r\nevents have profoundly enhanced national patriotism, a\r\nsense of self-reliance, self-resilience and ownership for\r\nthe Lao people. In carrying out our mandated task, we\r\nhave concentrated all our efforts and untapped strength\r\nto achieve the goals of poverty reduction by halving\r\nthe number of families currently living under the\r\npoverty line, stopping slash-and-burn practices, fully\r\neradicating opium production by the year 2005, and\r\ncreating an environment that will enable the country to\r\nquit once and for all the status of least developed\r\ncountry by the year 2020.\r\nThe first year of the twenty-first century has\r\nwitnessed new challenges that pose anxiety and\r\nconcern for all people worldwide. However, the\r\ntwentieth century has created institutional foundations\r\nfor strengthening the legal and cooperative framework,\r\nmodern technology and partial reform of our\r\nOrganization. In addition, dialogue and cooperation\r\nbetween countries in the economic, social and cultural\r\nfields and in other areas as well continue to be a\r\ngeneral trend in the world. In this spirit, I believe that\r\nthe United Nations, a unique and truly universal\r\nOrganization, reaffirmed by world leaders at the\r\nMillennium Summit last year, should play a significant\r\nrole in addressing these new challenges so that we can\r\nturn our world into a peaceful, happy and prosperous\r\none.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Louis Straker, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nMr. Straker (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines):\r\nMr. President, I bring you greetings from the small and\r\nbeautiful country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nPlease accept our congratulations on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. You are assured of my country’s full support\r\nfor a successful session. We would also like to offer\r\nour heartfelt congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan on his election to a second term, and to the\r\nUnited Nations Organization and the Secretary-General\r\nfor the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize received in\r\nhonour of their efforts to ensure a better and more\r\npeaceful world. It is impossible to think of more\r\ndeserving recipients of this award as this coalition of\r\nnations and our beloved Secretary-General strive to\r\nensure that the Organization fulfils its mandate\r\naccording to the Charter.\r\nI commend the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica for the statesmanship and resolve with which\r\nhe continues to deal with the difficulties at hand. I also\r\nsalute the civic leaders of this great city of New York\r\nfor the institutional leadership during this problematic\r\ntime. The city has been visited by tragedy once again\r\nthis week. On behalf of the Government and people of\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, I offer sincere\r\ncondolences to all those touched by this latest disaster,\r\nnot least our neighbours and friends in the Dominican\r\nRepublic.\r\nOur Government stands firm with the\r\ninternational community on Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) against terrorism. We are\r\nworking closely with the Governments of the region,\r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), Latin\r\nAmerica and the United States in an effort to fight the\r\nscourge of terrorism. Our Government has tightened\r\nsecurity and implemented measures intended to close\r\nany possible avenue that criminals and terrorists may\r\nexploit. We will do whatever is necessary to ensure that\r\nbarbarism is defeated. Compliance with resolution\r\n1373 (2001) is difficult and expensive for small States\r\nwith limited means and technical expertise. But we will\r\ncomply.\r\nThe international community has mustered an\r\nimpressive effort to fight the plague of terrorism. In\r\nthis midst of this, however, we must not lose sight of\r\nthe fact that terrorism will not be eradicated by one\r\nvictory in one war. It behooves us as world leaders to\r\nlook deeper into the causes of violence and terror. It is\r\nthe firm belief of my Government that marginalization\r\nof the poor and underprivileged creates a hotbed for\r\nextremism and lawlessness.\r\nWe in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the\r\nwider Caribbean have triumphed over the evils of\r\nslavery and colonialism to emerge with a truly noble\r\ncivilization. We are a people made up of races from the\r\nfour corners of the earth who have melded into one\r\nbeautiful whole. We are democratic in our governance\r\nand tolerant in our attitudes. We are a hard-working,\r\nindustrious people. We are proud. It is not in our nature\r\nto seek alms from the rich. But, Mr. President, it is\r\nself-evident that an economy such as ours, which is\r\nalmost totally dependent on agriculture and tourism,\r\nneeds help if we are to survive and prosper.\r\nThe influence of the multinational Chiquita and\r\nDole banana companies has been working for years to\r\ndestroy the industry of our banana farmers. The World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), of which we are a member,\r\nseems bent on widening the gulf between rich and poor.\r\nWe are not optimistic about the outcome of this week’s\r\neconomic Ministerial Meeting in Doha. A farmer\r\nworking one or two acres of mountain land and eking\r\nout a living cannot compete with the giants who control\r\nthousands of acres in the Central American countries.\r\nMr. President, if you take away that which feeds\r\nus, you must offer something in return. That is why the\r\nupcoming conference in Mexico on financing for\r\ndevelopment is of seminal importance to the small and\r\ndeveloping countries of this world. It is time for the\r\neconomic giants of the world to stop paying lip service\r\nto the idea of financing for development and to put into\r\npractice real and workable means for the poor,\r\nunderprivileged and vulnerable nations to join the\r\nmainstream. We need the commercial barriers erected\r\nby those intent on maintaining their hegemony to be\r\nremoved. We adhere to the adage “Trade, not Aid”. But\r\nthis is not yet a realistic option and, in the present\r\nclimate, will not be for the foreseeable future. We hate\r\nasking for charity. We merely ask that promises be kept\r\nand commitments adhered to. As a small island\r\ndeveloping State, we need relief from the burden of our\r\nforeign debts, high interest rates and other unfair\r\ninternational trade constraints. We need the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions to perform their function in a\r\ndemocratic and just manner.\r\nHIV/AIDS remains rampant worldwide. The\r\nrecent grave disaster in the United States of America\r\nhas pushed other burning issues of the day off the\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nworld agenda, but people have not stopped dying of\r\nAIDS. The 26 million who have been forecast to\r\nsuccumb to the scourge in the next 10 years will still\r\nsuccumb. In the same way that the United States and\r\nthe European Union were able to persuade drug\r\ncompanies to produce drugs to combat anthrax at a\r\nfraction of their normal cost, the same drug companies\r\nshould be persuaded to produce affordable treatment\r\nfor this plague, which is causing a national security\r\nthreat to many poor countries.\r\nThe state of affairs of HIV/AIDS has reached\r\ncircumstances of extreme urgency in our country. The\r\nCaribbean is now only second to sub-Saharan Africa in\r\nhaving the fastest rise in the incidents of HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe are not equipped to handle this crisis. We are not\r\nable to afford the drugs to treat our people. Therefore,\r\nour people are dying — dying in their hundreds and\r\nthousands. This world crisis, unlike terrorism, is one of\r\nwhich we know exactly what is required. Do we have\r\nthe will to provide the necessary means in order to\r\nresolve this problem? The special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly last June on HIV/AIDS ended with a\r\nglobal commitment to combat this disease. Are we\r\nliving up to our commitment?\r\nPrior to 11 September, our Government\r\nimplemented sound fiscal policies that resulted in\r\npositive economic growth for our country. However,\r\nafter that infamous day, the economic outlook turned\r\nextremely bleak. Our burgeoning tourist industry has\r\nsuffered tremendously, with employment taking an\r\nespecially heavy blow. Hotel occupancy dropped to a\r\n15-year low. There seems to be no end to the ripple\r\neffects on the industry. Just as people were beginning\r\nto fly again, we had the tragedy in Queens on Monday.\r\nThis plunges us deeper into economic gloom and the\r\nreal and frightening possibility of recession looms ever\r\ncloser.\r\nFollowing the admission of Tuvalu to the United\r\nNations last year, we were very close to realizing the\r\nprinciple of universality set forth in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. Now, only one remaining country\r\nawaits admission to the United Nations. That country,\r\nas we all know, is the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nThe Republic of China’s impressive record of\r\neconomic and political development is one of the most\r\npersuasive reasons to eliminate the United Nations sole\r\nexception to universality. Fifty years ago, Taiwan was a\r\npoor and underdeveloped society. Fifty years later, the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan has become an affluent\r\nand prosperous country, with a per capita gross national\r\nproduct of around $14,000, annual trade of over $300\r\nbillion and a gross national product of $320 billion.\r\nAlthough the Republic of China is only the one\r\nhundred thirty-eighth largest country in the world in\r\nterms of lands and the forty-sixth largest in terms of\r\npopulation, it is today the world’s seventeenth largest\r\neconomy, the fifteenth largest trading nation, the eighth\r\nlargest investor, the fourth largest holder of foreign\r\nexchange and the third largest exporter of information\r\ntechnology products.\r\nUnder our principle of universality, we cannot\r\ncontinue to exclude a country with such an impressive\r\nrecord of achievements. The time has come to open our\r\ndoors to the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan calls for immediate\r\naction on the part of the United Nations to fill the\r\npower vacuum left by the departure of the ruling\r\nTaliban from the capital, Kabul. We must make sure\r\nthat the new administration is representative of all\r\nfactions and we must further ensure that the suffering\r\nand starving people receive immediate humanitarian\r\naid to ensure their survival through the coming winter\r\nmonths.\r\nFinally, I must reiterate that we are encouraged\r\nby the efforts undertaken by the United Nations to\r\nwork towards a society that ensures security and human\r\ndignity for all in the future. The future looks good if\r\nwe all work together for the betterment of mankind. I\r\nassure the Assembly that my Prime Minister, Mr. Ralph\r\nGonsalves, and the Government and people of Saint\r\nVincent and the Grenadines are fully committed to\r\nsupporting the United Nations in these endeavours, and\r\nmay God direct all of us on this path.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Rodolphe Adada, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Cooperation and Francophonie of the Congo.\r\nMr. Adada (Congo) (spoke in French): The crash\r\nof American Airlines flight 587 two days ago has once\r\nagain cast into mourning the city of New York, which\r\nhas already suffered so much. On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Congo, I offer my most sincere\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families.\r\nI wish at the outset to congratulate you sincerely,\r\nSir, on your outstanding election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. The\r\ntrust that has been placed in you reflects the\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\ninternational community’s recognition of your qualities\r\nas an experienced diplomat and is a tribute to your\r\ncountry, the Republic of Korea, for the decisive role it\r\nplays in maintaining peace and security throughout the\r\nworld. You may rest assured of the full cooperation of\r\nthe delegation of the Congo.\r\nI express our gratitude to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the competence and deftness\r\nwith which he carried out his task.\r\nI also take this opportunity once again to offer\r\nour sincere congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan on his brilliant re-election and on his reception\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize, which is a crown on his\r\npersonal contribution and on that of our Organization.\r\nWe still have in our mind’s eye the terrifying and\r\nunbearable images of the attacks perpetrated against\r\nthe United States on 11 September —acts of pure\r\nbarbarity, blind terrorism that we condemn absolutely,\r\nas we do all other forms of violence, which must be\r\ncurbed and eradicated. In keeping with the commitment\r\nundertaken at the Millennium Summit, we must be\r\nespecially vigilant and determined in the fight against\r\nthat evil, which has no place in the world today. The\r\nCongo fully endorses all the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of\r\nthe response of the international community to\r\nterrorism, in particular Security Council resolutions\r\n1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).\r\nThe African continent, which has suffered for\r\nmany years from violence that has hampered its\r\ndevelopment and integration into the world of today,\r\nhas clearly condemned such acts, which can lead only\r\nto further destitution and poverty. That is why, at a\r\ntime when it is launching new initiatives to help it to\r\nemerge from crisis and promote development, Africa is\r\ndressing its wounds and appealing for various forms of\r\nlocal, regional and international mediation. These\r\ninitiatives have already borne fruit.\r\nWith regard to the conflict in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, which is of particular concern\r\nto my country, we welcome the progress that has been\r\naccomplished in implementing the Lusaka Agreement,\r\nwhich is enabling the United Nations Organization\r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\n(MONUC) to move on to phase III of its deployment.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the Security Council\r\nmeeting with the Political Committee of the Lusaka\r\nAgreement. We invite all the parties to continue to\r\ndemonstrate their goodwill in carrying out the\r\ncommitments they have undertaken. We have great\r\nhopes for the inter-Congolese dialogue, which is\r\nscheduled to take place in South Africa.\r\nAfter years of war and illegal exploitation of its\r\nwealth, that brotherly country needs to return to peace,\r\nnational unity and political stability and to fully\r\nrecover its sovereignty so that it can achieve the\r\nprogress promised by its enormous potential. My\r\ncountry, for its part, has always maintained good-\r\nneighbourly relations with the other side of the Congo\r\nRiver, and we will continue to contribute in every way\r\nwe can to ensure the peace and normalization that are\r\nso greatly desired.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nMr. Kofi Annan and, through him, his Special\r\nRepresentative, Mr. Namanga Ngongi, for the action\r\nthat has been carried out within the framework of\r\nMONUC.\r\nAs for Burundi, we would like to pay tribute to\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela for his mediation, which has\r\nled to the formation of a government of national unity,\r\nto which we wish every success. This process, which\r\nshould contribute to a return to lasting peace and\r\nstability for that country, deserves the full support of\r\nthe international community.\r\nIn Angola, the consistent resort to terrorism and\r\nother acts of sabotage by UNITA, in disregard of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, should lead us to\r\nstrengthen the sanctions against that organization,\r\nwhich is responsible for the continuation of war in the\r\ncountry. The Congo reaffirms its solidarity with the\r\npeople and the Government of Angola, who are sparing\r\nno effort to restore peace and rebuild their country. The\r\ninternational community must provide all necessary\r\nassistance to Angola.\r\nGiven the continuing violence in the Middle East,\r\na return to the Oslo accords is urgently required if the\r\ncurrent deadlock is to be broken. We appeal to the\r\nparties in conflict to show a willingness to move\r\nforward so as to re-establish a dialogue, which remains\r\nthe only way to restore lasting peace in an area of the\r\nworld that has been troubled for far too long. We\r\ntherefore welcome the constructive proposals made by\r\nthe President of the United States of America, His\r\nExcellency George W. Bush, on the coexistence of two\r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, within secure and\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nrecognized borders, as required by Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nSituations such as these are often and almost\r\nsystematically accompanied by the massive\r\ndisplacement of populations, which causes\r\ndestabilization in neighbouring countries and worsens\r\ndomestic problems. Such is the case in my country,\r\nwhich is currently hosting more than 200,000 refugees\r\nmainly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nAngola, Rwanda and, more recently, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic. The situation is a great cause for\r\nconcern in a country that is only just emerging from\r\nwar itself and is thus confronted by many other\r\nchallenges. Given the seriousness of this situation, I\r\nwould like once again to repeat the appeal of my\r\nGovernment for adequate assistance.\r\nAfter the signing, at the end of 1999, of\r\nagreements on the cessation of hostilities, the priority\r\ntasks set out by President Denis Sassou Nguesso were\r\nnational reconciliation and relaunching the democratic\r\nprocess, with a view to ensuring the reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment of the Congo. Today, almost all of these\r\nobjectives are in the process of being achieved.\r\nAt the political level, we organized in\r\nBrazzaville, from 14 March to 17 April 2001, a\r\nnational dialogue from which no one was barred, under\r\nthe auspices of an international mediator, His\r\nExcellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, President of the\r\nGabonese Republic, to whom we would like once again\r\nto express our deep gratitude. That dialogue has been\r\nsanctioned by the signing of the convention for peace\r\nand reconstruction in the Congo, as well as by the\r\nadoption of a preliminary draft of the constitution. This\r\npreliminary draft was approved by the National\r\nTransitional Council — our transitional parliament —\r\non 2 September, and it will be submitted to a\r\nreferendum before the end of this year. In preparation\r\nfor the constitutional referendum and the general\r\nelections, an administrative census has just been\r\ncarried out so as to draw up electoral lists.\r\nI would also like to mention the efforts being\r\nmade by the Government within the context of\r\nstrengthening the consolidation of peace. These\r\ninclude, in particular, the demobilization of over\r\n25,000 militia members; the collection of 10,817\r\nweapons and rounds of ammunition, of which 6,484\r\nhave already been destroyed, with the technical support\r\nof the International Organization for Migration;\r\nassistance for the reintegration of 6,844 former militia\r\nmembers, with the United Nations helping with more\r\nthan 2,190 small-scale projects; and the large-scale\r\nreturn of displaced persons and refugees to their\r\nnormal domicile.\r\nFurthermore, the establishment of a high\r\ncommission responsible for reintegrating former\r\ncombatants, a Committee for the follow-up of the\r\nconvention on peace and reconstruction in the Congo,\r\nand a national committee to eradicate poverty all form\r\npart of this momentum for the consolidation of peace.\r\nOur work will long continue to reflect the painful\r\nbackground against which it is taking place — the\r\nterrorist attacks. We have committed ourselves —\r\nrightly, unanimously and resolutely — to fighting this\r\nscourge. But this means that we must eradicate\r\nanything that might be used as a pretext for acts of\r\nblind destruction. To decrease tension throughout the\r\nworld is to deal with situations that can foster\r\nterrorism. But we should remember that an apparently\r\nlocal crisis can have repercussions very far away —\r\nsometimes even at the global level. In this context,\r\nglobalization must not be seen solely in economic and\r\ncommercial terms. In reality, we are talking about the\r\ndaily existence of individuals, peoples and nations,\r\nclosely linked because of the rupture of borders.\r\nThe eleventh of September just gave us a painful\r\nreminder that the world is one in its suffering, meaning\r\nthat we must also remain as one as we seek better\r\ntimes. That is why we must reduce, as quickly as\r\npossible, the gulf that separates the poorest among us\r\nfrom the wealthiest.\r\nThe socio-economic tensions we see throughout\r\nthe world are also the result of extreme poverty in\r\ndeveloping countries. Over 1 billion men and women\r\nare victims of malnutrition and do not even have access\r\nto drinking water or minimal health services. Unless\r\nwe accelerate growth, poverty will continue to worsen.\r\nWe must all therefore mobilize generally in order to\r\nurgently implement the strategies we ourselves have\r\nadopted here, especially those adopted during the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nWe should welcome the recent United Nations\r\ninitiative to set up a Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS\r\nand to respond to the desire of developing countries to\r\nhave access to new therapies at a lower cost.\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nWith regard to the particular economic situation\r\nin Africa, Congo expects that during this session the\r\ninternational community will support the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. As the\r\nAssembly is aware, the New Partnership — which\r\nharmonizes the concerns of the new African Union in\r\nthe areas of development and economic integration —\r\nis the response that Africa unanimously intends to\r\npresent to the challenges of globalization.\r\nIt is also appropriate now to again look at the\r\nessential instrument in that international struggle,\r\nnamely, the United Nations. The conferences and\r\nspecial session organized by the United Nations this\r\nyear — on the least developed countries, AIDS, human\r\nsettlements, the illicit trade in light weapons in all its\r\naspects, racism and many other issues — once again\r\nproves that our Organization remains a vital and\r\nirreplaceable instrument at the service of humankind. It\r\nis also in this framework that the fight against terrorism\r\nmust take place.\r\nAs we stated during the Millennium Summit last\r\nyear, we must, while relying on the United Nations,\r\nwork more resolutely and methodically to find\r\nsolutions to all those concerns. It is for this reason that\r\nI would like, in conclusion, to reaffirm my country’s\r\ncommitment to the United Nations, which must remain\r\nthe preferred forum for international coordination and\r\ndialogue among civilizations, for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of conflict, and for international economic\r\ncooperation in the service of all.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Mahamat Saleh Annadif, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Chad.\r\nMr. Annadif (Chad) (spoke in French): The\r\nGovernment and the people of Chad were profoundly\r\nshocked and saddened by the horrendous attacks on the\r\nUnited States of America that took place on 11\r\nSeptember 2001 in New York and Washington. I would\r\nlike to take this opportunity to convey once again the\r\nsincere condolences of the Government of Chad to the\r\nleaders of that friendly country and to the families of\r\nthe innocent victims.\r\nThose extremely barbaric attacks demonstrate\r\nhow urgently necessary it is for the international\r\ncommunity to move beyond the intentions expressed in\r\nthe various agreements on terrorism and agree on the\r\nimplementation of a genuine common plan of action to\r\neradicate terrorism totally and to free our world from\r\nthe suffering to which it is subjected as a result of\r\nextremism and fanaticism in all their forms. We must\r\nwork together to preserve peace and understanding\r\namong peoples for the sake of mankind’s future and all\r\nthose who comprise it — Jews, Muslims, Christians\r\nand others.\r\nWhile vigorously stressing that nothing can\r\njustify terrorism, the Republic of Chad would\r\nnonetheless like to share with the Assembly some\r\nthoughts prompted by the serious situation facing the\r\nworld.\r\nTerrorist bases are found on every continent, and\r\nthe struggle against this scourge involves every\r\nreligious community. It is for this reason that we must\r\ndenounce the equation that is being made between\r\nterrorism and a given religion. It is unacceptable for\r\ncertain media to perpetuate that equation in world\r\nopinion, thereby inciting hatred and exclusion. The war\r\nagainst terrorism must therefore be global and\r\nmultidimensional in nature. It must be the subject of\r\ngenuine cooperation among all peace- and justice-\r\nloving States, and it must take place within the most\r\nappropriate international framework, namely, the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis worldwide struggle need not necessarily be\r\nmilitary to be effective. It must go hand in hand with\r\neconomic measures to end the poverty and injustice\r\nevident in our world. We must also act on the political\r\nand diplomatic level to settle crisis situations and to\r\nidentify, try and punish those truly guilty of terrorist\r\nacts and their accomplices.\r\nNot long after the holding of the Millennium\r\nSummit and the Durban Conference against racism,\r\nand just before the high-level International Conference\r\non Financing for Development, scheduled for 2002, we\r\nmust unfortunately once again deplore the injustice,\r\npoverty and suffering endured by the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the world’s peoples. In the course of our\r\nmany international meetings, we have constantly said\r\nthat the world needs more solidarity and that the\r\nwealthier countries must expand their financial efforts\r\nto contribute to the economic and social development\r\nof the neediest peoples. In saying that we are not\r\nasking for charity, but rather for realizing the legitimate\r\nright of those peoples to development. Alas, the real\r\nstate of affairs falls far short of our hopes.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nPoverty continues to grow in the world, and the\r\nfuture of the world’s poor is undermined by the plight\r\nof their children. Hundreds of millions of those\r\nchildren work in inhuman conditions in order to\r\nsurvive. They are left to their miserable fate in the\r\nstreets, subject to violence, drugs and prostitution,\r\nwhose corollary is AIDS. The situation is all the more\r\nappalling given that, despite promises to reduce or\r\ncancel the debt of poor countries, that debt continues to\r\ngrow, its burden hampering economic growth. At the\r\nsame time, some financial speculators can make tens of\r\nbillions of dollars in a single financial market\r\ntransaction — 10, or even 20, times the amount of\r\nrecent years’ generous debt write-offs.\r\nHow can our world continue to profess respect\r\nfor human rights while allowing those in the North and\r\nSouth who benefit from the global system that\r\ngenerates such poverty and all the injustices\r\nexacerbated by globalization? What meaning do human\r\nrights have for people who do not even have access to\r\nthe basic right to feed themselves? Can we therefore\r\ncontinue to dream of a better world knowing that the\r\nrich countries are continuing to cut back their\r\ndevelopment assistance?\r\nIt is therefore inconceivable to us to hope to fight\r\nterrorism without the genuine solidarity of the rich\r\ncountries with the neediest. Yes, in this troubled world\r\nin which the international community is threatened by\r\nmajor conflict, it would not be out of place to reaffirm\r\nour desire to see the emergence of genuine solidarity\r\namong peoples and nations in the form of sound and\r\nmutually advantageous cooperation in order to redress\r\nthese injustices, which are, I stress, the main breeding\r\ngrounds of terrorism.\r\nIn order to address all the challenges posed by\r\nthis difficult world, my country, Chad, knows that it\r\nmust rely above all on its own capacities if it is to\r\noccupy its rightful place in international life and to\r\nmake its modest contribution to the building of a better\r\nworld. That is the underlying message of the\r\nunrelenting struggle waged by President Idriss Deby\r\nsince 1 December 1990 to establish a pluralistic\r\ndemocracy in Chad, the guarantee of sustainable\r\ndevelopment in peace and stability.\r\nI wish to state today that my country recently\r\nreached a decisive stage in the consolidation of that\r\npluralistic democracy through the presidential election\r\nof 20 May. That election, the second of its kind in the\r\nhistory of Chad, involved seven competing candidates\r\nand resulted in the election of Mr. Idriss Deby, the\r\noutgoing President, to a second five-year term. It took\r\nplace in total transparency, as attested by national and\r\ninternational observers. Moreover, the Chadian\r\nGovernment attaches great importance to the\r\nlegislative elections to be held in 2002, with the\r\nassistance of the international community.\r\nOn the economic level, since 1995 Chad has\r\nfollowed a recovery strategy intended to lay the basis\r\nfor sustainable economic and social development.\r\nThorough reforms have been undertaken to improve\r\nand stabilize public finance, to correct external\r\nimbalances and to launch lasting growth. These actions\r\nrequire an effective anti-poverty policy, with respect to\r\nwhich Chad, through me, expresses its gratitude to the\r\ninternational community for its support, in particular at\r\nthe fourth Geneva round table of 1998 on the\r\ndevelopment of Chad and at the sectoral meeting and\r\nthe mid-term review meeting of 2000.\r\nFurthermore, following lengthy and heated\r\ndiscussion, the oil project has been finalized and is\r\noperating well. Chad is now vesting great hope in its\r\neffects and looks forward to using its resources to\r\nfinance its poverty reduction strategy. In that regard, I\r\nwould recall that, for the first time in the history of\r\npetroleum exploitation, legislation has been enacted to\r\nguarantee transparency in revenue management and to\r\nreserve a portion of the profit for local communities in\r\nthe producing region and their future generations.\r\nAlong with these domestic efforts, Chad will\r\ncontinue to work tirelessly for subregional and regional\r\nintegration in Africa. The challenges facing the modern\r\nworld require all nations to pool their means and\r\nefforts in great economic, monetary and cultural\r\ngroupings. Even if the international situation should\r\nbecome favourable and the industrialized countries\r\nshould choose to heed the voice of Africa, we believe\r\nthat it is up to Africans ourselves, first and foremost, to\r\nbuild our continent.\r\nThe launching in July 2001 in Lusaka of the\r\nprocess of establishing the organs of the African Union\r\nopened encouraging prospects for the achievement of\r\nthe legitimate aspirations of the African peoples to\r\npeace, security and well-being in a much fairer world.\r\nThe African peoples are convinced that only a genuine\r\nunion will allow Africa to address its challenges and to\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nextricate itself from the economic stagnation and\r\nviolence that plague it.\r\nCivil war and violence of all sorts, generated by\r\ninjustice and poverty, are found throughout the world\r\nand on every continent. Their proliferation and extent\r\nare deeply worrisome, especially since they are fuelled\r\nand perpetuated by certain countries that place their\r\nown interests above those of the peace and stability of\r\nnations. What can we say about the hesitation of\r\ncertain countries to participate actively or morally in\r\nprevention, management, settlement or peacekeeping\r\noperations? In our opinion, it is equally unthinkable to\r\nseek to combat terrorism while allowing crises that\r\nfeed it to persist.\r\nWith respect to such crises, allow me to refer to\r\ncertain conflicts situations that are of particular\r\nconcern to my country, Chad.\r\nCentral Africa, which in recent years has become\r\na theatre of political and tribal tensions, has ultimately\r\nbecome aware of its situation in the international\r\nlandscape. It has therefore resolutely committed itself\r\non the path to ensuring the creation of improved\r\nsecurity conditions. In that regard, we must commend\r\nthe efforts of the international mediators and those\r\nstatesmen who have personally and effectively\r\ncontributed to defusing a number of hotbeds of tension\r\nin that part of the continent.\r\nHowever, while we may welcome the restoration\r\nof peace in Congo Brazzaville, the same is not yet true\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where,\r\nregrettably, war continues to claim innocent victims.\r\nWe hope that the inter-Congolese dialogue begun in\r\nAddis Ababa will result in a peaceful settlement to that\r\nfratricidal conflict, which has gone on too long.\r\nWe also certainly welcome the stabilization of the\r\nsituation in the Central African Republic, but recent\r\nevents have revealed the precariousness of the\r\nsituation. In this regard, Chad reaffirms through me\r\nthat it will tolerate no destabilization of that fraternal\r\ncountry through its borders and will always do its\r\nutmost to promote understanding and concord among\r\nits Central African brothers. It also calls on the\r\ninternational community to assist that neighbouring\r\ncountry in the restoration of lasting peace.\r\nIn Burundi, although armed confrontations\r\ncontinue to occur, we welcome the establishment of a\r\nunion Government and hail the tireless work done by\r\nPresident Nelson Mandela as facilitator to ensure that\r\nthe current negotiation process leads to national peace\r\nand concord in the country.\r\nAs to Angola, the Government of the Republic of\r\nChad reaffirms its support for the legitimate\r\nGovernment in its efforts to achieve peace and security.\r\nIn West Africa, the agreement on voluntary\r\ndisarmament signed under the auspices of the United\r\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone has yielded tangible\r\nresults and is now the only proper course for resolving\r\nthe crisis in that country. We encourage the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States to continue to work\r\nto restore lasting pace to that subregion.\r\nAs to the Horn of Africa, Chad encourages any\r\ninitiative on the part of the belligerent parties to bring\r\nabout national reconciliation in Somalia on the basis of\r\nthe Arta agreements. Likewise, the Chadian\r\nGovernment welcomes the observance of the ceasefire\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea, and exhorts these two\r\nfraternal countries to build peace along their common\r\nborder. As to the embargo on Libya, Chad unreservedly\r\nsupports its immediate lifting, without conditions and\r\nin full, because it unjustly penalizes the fraternal\r\nLibyan people.\r\nIn the Middle East, it is time for the tragedy of\r\nthe Palestinian people, which has lasted for more than\r\nhalf a century, to be brought to a peaceful, fair and\r\nlasting conclusion. It is more urgent and necessary than\r\never for pressure of all kinds to be brought to bear on\r\nthe State of Israel to induce it to fulfil the terms of the\r\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council on the\r\nPalestinian question, in particular resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973). The credibility of the\r\ninternational community depends on the ability of the\r\nPalestinians to enjoy all their rights, including the right\r\nto an independent and sovereign State.\r\nTurning to another injustice in the world, namely,\r\nthe inhuman embargo imposed on Iraq, my\r\nGovernment calls for its immediate and unconditional\r\nlifting, because it no longer has any justification. As to\r\nthe injustice committed by our Organization vis-à-vis\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, the time has come to\r\nset things right, in order to allow that country, whose\r\nhuman, economic and political weight is unquestioned,\r\nto occupy its legitimate place in the family of nations,\r\nwhich is to say in the United Nations, following its\r\nrecent admission to the World Trade Organization,\r\nwhich we welcome.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nOn this solemn occasion, we cannot fail to refer\r\nto another undemocratic and unjust feature of the\r\nstructures of our Organization. In this regard, I would\r\nlike to recall in the strongest terms that Chad still\r\nadheres to the common African position on the\r\nrestructuring of the United Nations, including the\r\nenlargement and reform of the Security Council, so as\r\nto ensure fair representation for all regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nBefore I conclude, allow me to extend to you, Sir,\r\nthe warm congratulations of the Chadian delegation on\r\nyour well-deserved election to lead the fifty-sixth\r\nregular session of the General Assembly. I am\r\nconvinced that your personal and professional qualities\r\nwill guarantee the successful conduct of our work.\r\nAllow me also to convey the sincere thanks of my\r\ndelegation to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for\r\nthe tact and wisdom with which he conducted the work\r\nof the previous session.\r\nI wish lastly to convey the Republic of Chad’s\r\nsincere congratulations to our brother Kofi Annan,\r\nSecretary-General of this Organization, on the renewed\r\ntrust that the international community has just placed\r\nin him for a second term, and also on the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize that was awarded to him and to the United\r\nNations. The dedication of the Secretary-General to the\r\ncause of peace, progress and development has been\r\nthoroughly demonstrated. We therefore wish to assure\r\nhim of the support and encouragement of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Chad throughout his\r\nnew term in office.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Naji Sabri, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq.\r\nMr. Sabri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I am glad to\r\nextend to you, Sir, my congratulations on your election\r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at this\r\nimportant session. We are fully confident that you will\r\nguide its work to complete success. I am also pleased\r\nto congratulate the Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\non his re-election to a second term of office.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly acquires\r\nspecial importance given that it is being held at a time\r\nwhen the international family is facing increasingly\r\nserious problems. The deterioration of the international\r\npolitical and economic environment has reached an\r\nalarming point, threatening the very core of the\r\nindividual and collective security of the Member States\r\nand the future of humanity as a whole.\r\nInstability in international relations has increased\r\nas a result of the unilateral management of\r\ninternational affairs on the basis of the law of brute\r\nforce. There has been a proliferation of such\r\nphenomena as the unilateral use of force, infringement\r\nof international law and the Charter, political\r\nblackmail, blockades and violation of peoples’ rights to\r\ndetermine their own political, economic and social\r\nchoices. The suffering of the peoples of developing\r\ncountries has increased as a result of the lack of\r\neconomic and social development and the widespread\r\ntendencies among wealthy nations to impose their\r\neconomic hegemony and technical and scientific\r\nblockades under the guise of globalization. Attempts\r\nare increasing to impose certain cultures on the peoples\r\nof the world, heaping scorn on their religious beliefs,\r\ncreeds and political and social choices and preaching\r\nthe clash of civilizations and the launching of new\r\ncrusades.\r\nIt was in these circumstances that the events of 11\r\nSeptember took place in the United States, with all the\r\nensuing suffering and victims. While we have offered\r\nour sincere condolences to the American people and\r\nthe families of the innocent victims of these events,\r\nIraq has expressed its hope that the United States will\r\ndeal with these events in a spirit of wisdom and\r\nresponsibility by undertaking a comprehensive review\r\nof its policies towards other peoples and States with a\r\nview to finding ways to ensure security, stability and\r\npeace for the people of the United States and for all the\r\npeoples of the world.\r\nThe United States, however, has once again\r\nresorted to the logic of brute force; hence its aggression\r\nagainst Afghanistan. Then came the use of biological\r\nmaterials in subversive operations, whose source,\r\naccording to American authorities, is most likely to be\r\nfound in the United States. All this was accompanied\r\nby Western media campaigns intended to kindle\r\nfeelings of rancour, hatred and chauvinism and to stoke\r\nthe fires of war and aggression in the world. This\r\nconfirms that the present world order is extremely\r\nfragile and that the fires of any conflagration anywhere\r\ncould spread to the whole world. Indeed, wide as it is,\r\nthe world could be set on fire by a spark coming from\r\nthe West. The world needs to save itself from falling\r\ninto an abyss, to which it is being pushed by policies\r\nthat have their roots in hubris, arrogance, injustice and\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\naggression. The world needs justice based on fairness;\r\nit should not use force on the basis of power and\r\nadvantage. Perceiving the dangers to which the world\r\nis being exposed, our leader President Saddam Hussein\r\nof the Republic of Iraq has called for acting wisely and\r\nreasonably to spare humanity the scourges of\r\nvengeance, war, rancour and hatred. On 29 October\r\n2001, he launched an initiative calling for the world to\r\ncooperate, on the basis of a global agreement, to rid\r\nitself of the burden and dangers of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, beginning with the huge arsenal of such\r\nweapons stockpiled primarily in the United States and\r\nsecondarily in the Zionist entity. In his initiative,\r\nPresident Saddam Hussein emphasized that,\r\n“When the United States begins to divest itself of\r\nits weapons of mass destruction with the rest of\r\nthe world following suit, the United States will\r\nfind its way to the paths of wisdom. The world\r\nwill treat it with respect and love after sensing the\r\nrespect and love coming from it. The world,\r\nincluding the United States, will then have peace,\r\nrather than stand at the brink of the abyss.”\r\nFrom this rostrum we call for reason, wisdom and\r\nthe rule of law to prevail over impetuosity, recklessness\r\nand the law of brute force. We stress the importance of\r\nproceeding with a comprehensive objective effort to rid\r\nthe world of all weapons of mass destruction and to set\r\nup a just and equitable international order in which all\r\ncan enjoy peace, security and prosperity. It is now clear\r\nthat the current discriminatory theories of non-\r\nproliferation and the mindset of drawing a distinction\r\nbetween safe and unsafe possession of weapons of\r\nmass destruction will not lead to a lessening of the\r\ndangers to the world, but instead to the exact opposite.\r\nIraq has suffered and continues to suffer\r\naggression and terrorism. Its leaders, officials and\r\nnationals have been subjected to numerous terrorist\r\nattempts on their lives. Its towns and villages have\r\nbeen the targets of many acts of terrorism at the hands\r\nof terrorist infiltrators coming from across the border,\r\nwho are sponsored, trained, financed and armed within\r\nthe framework of State terrorism.\r\nThe Iraqi nuclear reactor devoted to peaceful\r\npurposes was the target of a terrorist attack by\r\nwarplanes of the Zionist entity in 1981. Iraq’s towns\r\nand villages and economic, scientific and cultural\r\nfacilities were also systematically targeted and\r\ndestroyed in the course of the aggression launched by\r\nthe United States and the United Kingdom and their\r\nallies in 1991 and in the five large-scale attacks that\r\nfollowed in 1993, 1996, 1998 and 2001. Furthermore,\r\nfor 11 years now Iraq has suffered comprehensive\r\nsanctions that have deprived its people and that have so\r\nfar claimed the lives of 1.6 million civilians, the\r\nmajority of whom are children and the elderly. Both the\r\naggression and the comprehensive sanctions constitute\r\nsystematic State terrorism directed against an entire\r\npeople.\r\nThe daily aggression launched by aircraft of the\r\nUnited States and the United Kingdom against Iraqi\r\ntowns and villages within the so-called no-fly zones\r\nimposed by these two States on the basis of a unilateral\r\nand illegal decision taken in flagrant violation of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law is\r\nalso State terrorism. We must also mention the\r\nexplosions carried out in certain Iraqi border areas by\r\nelements of mercenary infiltrators, who are financed,\r\narmed and harboured by certain States, including the\r\nUnited States, which openly spends tens of millions of\r\ndollars on mercenary bands for the purpose of carrying\r\nout terrorist operations in Iraq under the so-called Iraq\r\nLiberation Act. The term “terrorism” also applies to the\r\nuse by the United States and the United Kingdom of\r\nmore than 300 tons of depleted uranium ammunition\r\nagainst the people of Iraq in 1991. Through the ensuing\r\ntoxic radiological effects, this has led to an increase in\r\nthe number of embryonic deformities, a tenfold\r\nincrease in cancer cases and pollution of the\r\nenvironment of the region for many generations to\r\ncome.\r\nAll these and other acts that violate the principles\r\nof international law are acts of terrorism. In the face of\r\nthese acts of terrorism and aggression, Iraq has made\r\nmany sacrifices in defence of its sovereignty,\r\nindependence, dignity and national choices. The brave\r\npeople of Iraq are more determined today than at any\r\ntime in the past. They take pride in and cherish their\r\nnational leadership, holding fast to their sovereignty,\r\ndignity and national and regional interests, defending\r\ntheir independence and political choices and defying\r\nall the evil intentions that stand behind the aggression\r\nand acts of terrorism directed against them.\r\nThe fact that Iraq is a victim of international\r\nterrorism has made it one of the first countries to call\r\nfor combating terrorism. Iraqi national legislation\r\nprovides for harsher punishment for terrorist acts. Iraq\r\nhas signed and ratified most international conventions\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nin force against terrorism. Iraq believes that, in order to\r\nconfront international terrorism, including State\r\nterrorism, it is necessary to initiate, under the umbrella\r\nof the United Nations, an international effort to reach\r\nagreement on a definition of terrorism and on ways to\r\ncombat it, in accordance with international law and the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIraq is prepared to participate actively in such an\r\ninternational effort to combat terrorism in all its forms,\r\nwhether perpetrated by individuals, groups or States.\r\nHere, it is necessary to emphasize the natural,\r\ninalienable right of all peoples to defend their\r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as\r\nwell as to struggle against all forms of terrorism,\r\nincluding foreign occupation, colonialist control and\r\naggression in all its military and economic forms,\r\nintervention in the internal affairs of States and the\r\ninstigation and financing of ethnic and religious\r\nconflicts among peoples of the world. All these rights\r\nare embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and\r\ninternational law.\r\nIn discussing the question of reforming the\r\ncurrent unsound state of international relations, we\r\nmust point out the need to reform international\r\nmechanisms, foremost among which is the Security\r\nCouncil, to which the Member States of the United\r\nNations have entrusted the primary responsibility of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe practices of the Security Council, especially\r\nin the last 11 years, have made it clear that the Council\r\nis no longer true to its role as specified by the Charter;\r\nthat it has become a tool for implementing the policies\r\nof one single State; and that it now stands as a glaring\r\nmodel practitioner of double standards. Suffice it to\r\ncite, as just one example among many, the fact that the\r\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed by the Council on\r\nIraq constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter and\r\nthe mandate of the Council. This was admitted by the\r\nUnited Nations itself, as stated in the report entitled\r\n“The right to food”, submitted under cover of the\r\nSecretary-General’s note of 23 July 2001, in which the\r\nSpecial Rapporteur of the Commission on Human\r\nRights on the right to food said:\r\n“There can be little doubt that subjecting the Iraqi\r\npeople to a harsh economic embargo since 1991\r\nhas placed the United Nations in a clear violation\r\nof the obligation to respect the right to food of\r\npeople in Iraq.” (A/56/210, para. 56)\r\nLikewise, the expert of the Subcommission on the\r\nPromotion and Protection of Human Rights had this to\r\nsay on the subject in a report dated 21 June 2000:\r\n“The sanctions regime against Iraq is\r\nunequivocally illegal under existing international\r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law. Some\r\nwould go as far as making a charge of genocide.”\r\n(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2000/33, para. 71)\r\nWe therefore call for a comprehensive reform of\r\nthe Security Council that would lead to the expansion\r\nof its membership and to the reform of its methods of\r\nwork, with specific reference to its decision-making\r\nprocess, so as to ensure full respect by the Council for\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter and the\r\nprinciple of democracy in international relations.\r\nIt has also become necessary to establish a\r\nmechanism for judicial review that would rule on the\r\nlegality and constitutionality of Security Council\r\nresolutions in order to ensure that they are consistent\r\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and with international law. We believe\r\nthat Member States should be able to resort to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice to appeal resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council which these States consider as\r\ninvolving infringement on the principles of the Charter\r\nand international law.\r\nThus we will be able to remedy this flagrant\r\ndeviation from all democratic, judicial and legal norms\r\nand principles in the work and mandate of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nPending the completion of the process of\r\nreforming the Security Council and of ensuring that it\r\nplays its role in conformity with the Charter, States\r\nMembers of the United Nations should reconsider their\r\nauthorization to the Council to act on their behalf in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, since\r\nthe Council has abused that authorization. There is no\r\nmore obvious case in this regard than that of the\r\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq. No just-\r\nthinking State can afford to remain a spectator when it\r\nsees the authorization it granted to the Security Council\r\nbeing used to annihilate the people of Iraq.\r\nIt is the legal and moral obligation of all States\r\nthat respect international law and the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations to declare that they are not parties to\r\nthis crime and that they did not authorize the Security\r\nCouncil to kill the children of Iraq in their name. The\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\ncomprehensive sanctions imposed on Iraq have\r\ninflicted enormous damage on the interests of a\r\nconsiderable number of the countries of the world, and\r\nthese countries are called upon to put a stop to these\r\nillegal acts and to restore their trade relations with Iraq,\r\nin implementation of Article 50 of the Charter.\r\nThe organized terrorism to which the people of\r\nPalestine are being subjected by the Zionist entity, the\r\nfounder and primary source of terrorism, can be seen in\r\nthe bombing of towns, villages, camps and Islamic and\r\nChristian houses of worship, as well as in political\r\nassassinations, imposition of collective punishments,\r\noccupation of Muslim holy sites, use of depleted\r\nuranium ammunitions and poison gases, bulldozing of\r\nfarms and confiscation of lands.\r\nThis organized terrorism calls for a reaction on\r\nthe part of the international community that is\r\ncommensurate with the gravity of these genocidal\r\npractices against a whole people. Similarly, the\r\nsystematic destruction to which the Afghan people are\r\nbeing subjected at the hands of the American military\r\nmachine is an illegal unilateral use of force and should\r\ncome to an end. I should like to refer here to the\r\nSecretary-General’s 1999 annual report on the work of\r\nthe Organization, in which he stated that\r\n“enforcement actions without Security Council\r\nauthorization threaten the very core of the\r\ninternational security system founded on the\r\nCharter of the United Nations” (A/54/1, para. 66).\r\nWe demand an end to this interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of Afghanistan. The Afghan people\r\nshould be able to make their own political choices, in\r\nconformity with their national interests and without\r\nany external interference, under whatever pretext.\r\nThe United Nations was founded for the purpose\r\nof achieving security, peace and stability, so that social\r\nand economic progress for all peoples might be\r\npromoted by a number of means, including avoidance\r\nof wars and conflicts. But today two thirds of the\r\npopulation of the world suffer from underdevelopment\r\nand live in misery, while the few live in prosperity.\r\nWhat is required is to reactivate the role of the United\r\nNations in the search for a balanced international\r\neconomic policy that will lead to greater equality\r\namong peoples and States, lessen the intensity of\r\npolitical conflicts and feelings of frustration, engage all\r\nas partners in building the world economy, promote\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, and bring\r\nabout a better life for peoples.\r\nEfforts to reform the international political\r\nenvironment will not meet with success if they are not\r\naccompanied by efforts to reform the economic\r\nenvironment with a view to extending prosperity to all\r\nhumankind. We must remember that the vast resources\r\nwith which God Almighty has favoured our planet\r\nEarth are sufficient to enable us to achieve prosperity,\r\nsecurity and stability for all. What we need is the\r\nconviction that all human beings are equal in terms of\r\ntheir worth, and we must work hard to avert, and put an\r\nend to, all policies and actions that violate this truth\r\nand cause upheavals in international relations.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Farouk Al-Shara, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Shara (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of this session.\r\nWe are confident that the posts you held in your\r\ncountry and the respect you enjoy will facilitate your\r\ntask in leading the deliberations of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives.\r\nI would also like to express our appreciation to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the efforts he\r\nmade last year to lead the work of the previous session\r\nto a successful conclusion. Let me also congratulate\r\nMr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a second term as\r\nSecretary-General of our international Organization\r\nand on winning the Nobel Peace Prize, together with\r\nthe United Nations. I would like to assure him that our\r\ncooperation with him will continue in order to\r\nconsolidate the role of the United Nations in various\r\ndomains.\r\nThe international and regional circumstances\r\nprevailing since the events of last September have cast\r\na dark shadow on our work. The new world order,\r\nwhose emergence was announced after the\r\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union and the Gulf war,\r\nsoon faltered, due to the failure or lack of desire to\r\nadopt the language of dialogue in order to eliminate\r\nhostile climates and the refusal to apply equal\r\nstandards in international relations to resolve regional\r\nconflicts, and due to the adoption of the method of\r\ndaily crisis management, which consists of addressing\r\nonly surface issues, instead of delving deep into the\r\nroot causes and addressing them according to the\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\ncriteria of justice, international legitimacy and human\r\nsolidarity.\r\nThe world watched in disbelief the horrifying\r\nattacks on Washington, D.C., and New York. We in\r\nSyria and in the Arab world did not hesitate to\r\ndenounce those attacks and to condemn them in the\r\nstrongest possible terms. In the aftermath of those\r\nattacks, we also called for international cooperation\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations to uproot\r\nterrorism in all its forms. Likewise, we called for an\r\nagreement on measures to define terrorism in an effort\r\nto guarantee effectiveness in combating it and in\r\naddressing its root causes.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism is not confined to a\r\nparticular society, culture or religion. It has appeared,\r\nand is still appearing, in many countries made up of\r\nnumerous groups with different demands, beliefs and\r\nobjectives. That is why it is a gross injustice and is\r\ntotally unrealistic to link terrorism to Arabs and\r\nMuslims. Suffice it to mention, for example, a number\r\nof infamous terrorist organizations such as Bader-\r\nMeinhoff gang, in Germany, the Red Brigades, in Italy\r\nand Japan, and what has been taking place in Northern\r\nIreland and in Spain, not to mention the various\r\nextremist organizations in the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nThose who link terrorist acts to Islam ignore the\r\nfact that Islam respects all monotheistic religions, calls\r\nfor tolerance among their followers and prohibits the\r\nkilling of innocents or acts of aggression against their\r\nproperties. But the pressing question now is how to\r\neliminate from the minds of American citizens the\r\nfeeling of hatred against Arabs and Muslims, feelings\r\npromoted by tens of thousands of publications, articles\r\nand films for the last 50 years.\r\nSenior officials at the highest level in the\r\nAmerican Administration and in European countries\r\nhave warned against linking terrorism to Arabs and\r\nMuslims and have issued positive statements. But,\r\nregrettably, those statements, though important, cannot\r\nerase the long history of defamation in books and films\r\nthat have distorted the image of Arabs and remain in\r\ncirculation. Moreover, we have recently heard that new\r\nfilms are being made, and books being prepared for\r\npublication, that incite feelings of hatred and link\r\nterrorism to Arabs and Muslims, thereby manipulating\r\nthe tragic events of September.\r\nSyria has always stressed the need to work on all\r\nlevels to combat international terrorism in all its forms\r\nand in a way that is consistent with the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations. Syria\r\nwas the first country to call, in 1985, for the convening\r\nof an international conference under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations to define terrorism and to differentiate\r\nit from the struggle of peoples for national liberation.\r\nIn response to a request by Syria, an item was listed on\r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly, stressing the\r\nimportance of determining the root causes of terrorism\r\nand taking appropriate measures to prevent it, combat\r\nit and address its root causes.\r\nSyria has also called upon all countries to take the\r\nnecessary measures at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels to combat terrorism and implement\r\nthe provisions of international law and relevant\r\ninternational resolutions, with the aim of preventing\r\nthe perpetration of terrorist acts or their financing and\r\ninciting. We would also like to indicate that, since\r\n1952, the Syrian Arab Republic has been one of the\r\nfirst countries to adopt firm national laws and\r\nlegislation to combat terrorism.\r\nInternational terrorism is not a new phenomenon.\r\nSyria and other Arab countries have also been victims\r\nof terrorism. For years we have called upon the\r\ninternational community to condemn all types of\r\nterrorism, especially the State terrorism practised by\r\nIsrael. In this context, I would like to refer to the\r\nvalues of tolerance that have distinguished our region\r\nthroughout history. Our region had never known the\r\nphenomenon of terrorism until after Israel was created\r\non the basis of religion, in 1948, supported by the\r\nefforts of such well-known terrorist organizations as\r\nthe Irgun, Tzioni, the Stern gang, the Lehy and the\r\nHaganah, which were responsible for sowing the seeds\r\nof terrorism and fear in Palestine and outside it.\r\nIsrael has invented new types of terrorist\r\npractices in order to continue its occupation of Arab\r\nterritories. It expelled Palestinians from their homes\r\nand lands and perpetrated numerous massacres,\r\nbeginning with the massacre of Deir Yassin in 1948, to\r\nthat of Beit Reima just a few weeks ago. But despite\r\nthat, it has not been held accountable for these crimes.\r\nThe Palestinian people have, therefore, had no\r\nalternative in their struggle to rid themselves of their\r\nstate of frustration, despair and international disregard\r\nfor their plight but to start one uprising after another as\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\na way to liberate their lands from occupation and to\r\nrestore their dignity like any other people in the world.\r\nWhat is both odd and surprising is that whenever\r\nPalestinian refugees and their organizations residing in\r\nSyria are mentioned, the United States describes them\r\nas terrorist organizations and considers the country that\r\nhosts them as one that sponsors terrorism. It ignores\r\nthe fact that Israel was completely responsible for\r\nuprooting those Palestinians from their homes,\r\nexpelling them from their homeland and denying them,\r\nup until this very moment, their right of return in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 194\r\n(III). Regrettably, there are some countries and certain\r\nmedia outlets that believe those claims and describe\r\nthose Palestinian organizations as terrorist. They do not\r\nstop there, but extend that allegation to Syria as well,\r\ninstead of condemning Israel and expressing\r\nappreciation to Syria for hosting about 500,000\r\nPalestinian refugees and offering them work, security\r\nand a dignified life.\r\nBut in any case the request on the part of Israel\r\nand those who support it to have these Palestinian\r\nrefugees and their organizations expelled from Syria\r\nraises the very important question of where those\r\nrefugees should go. The natural and human answer\r\nsays that they should go back to their country,\r\nPalestine. They are more entitled to go back to their\r\nhomes than the million Russian Jews who were brought\r\nin by Israel during the last 10 years. They are also more\r\nentitled than another 1 million Jews that the head of the\r\nIsraeli Government plans to bring into Israel, although\r\nthey live well and securely in their countries. Although\r\nthe rulers of Israel claim that the Palestinians have no\r\nplace in their towns and villages and that the return of\r\nPalestinians threatens the existence of Israel, the truth\r\nis that the return of Palestinian refugees will alleviate\r\nracism in Israel and will not threaten its existence.\r\nDuring its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 Israel\r\nperpetrated the ugliest of crimes when it shelled and\r\nbesieged Beirut for over 80 days, during which time\r\nthousands of innocent Lebanese civilians were killed,\r\nthe infrastructure of Lebanon was destroyed and many\r\nhorrific massacres were perpetrated. Those massacres\r\nincluded the atrocities at Sabra and Shatila, which the\r\nentire world witnessed and is aware of.\r\nFaced with Israeli arrogance, the failure of the\r\ninternational community to stop Israel from\r\nperpetrating its crimes, and the provision of Israel with\r\nthe latest American warplanes and the most destructive\r\nand sophisticated weapons, the Lebanese people had no\r\nchoice but to stand fast and resist occupation. This\r\nresistance continued until it achieved its most\r\nimportant victory in May 2000, when it forced the\r\nIsraeli occupying forces to abandon most Lebanese\r\nterritories. No one in the world should forget that the\r\nbattles of the Lebanese resistance were fought on the\r\noccupied territories of Lebanon against occupying\r\nIsraeli soldiers and that this resistance did not act\r\nbeyond Lebanese borders and did not hurt Israeli\r\ncivilians during the 20 years of occupation, whereas\r\nthe occupying Israeli forces killed thousands of\r\nLebanese civilians, not to mention their repeated\r\ndestruction of hundreds of houses and much of the\r\nLebanese infrastructure.\r\nAfter all this, how could anyone fail to\r\ndistinguish between terrorism and resistance? Anyone\r\nwishing to target terrorism in our region must target\r\nIsraeli terrorism first and foremost, because what Israel\r\ndoes is the utmost form of terrorism; it is absolutely\r\nbereft of human compassion. There is no alternative\r\nbut to address the root causes of this terrorism once and\r\nfor all and uproot it from our modern life through the\r\nimplementation of international legitimacy in order to\r\nrestore rights, end injustice and occupation and grant\r\nthe Palestinian people the right to self-determination\r\nfreely and wholly.\r\nThese days mark the tenth anniversary of the\r\nconvening of the Madrid Peace Conference, for which\r\nwe made sincere efforts so it would create an opening\r\nfor a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe serious and purposeful negotiations that Syria has\r\nengaged in during recent years have shown two things\r\nto the international community: first, that Israel neither\r\ndesires nor is serious about achieving a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in accordance with United\r\nNations resolutions; secondly, that Syria has the right\r\nto recover its territory in the Golan to the border of 4\r\nJune 1967, without compromise. However, we were\r\nalways faced with Israel’s intransigence, denial of\r\nrights, evasion of the real issues and of the\r\nrequirements of peace. Indeed, Israel has done what its\r\nPrime Minister promised at the time: to make\r\nnegotiations go in circles for 10 years, with all the\r\ndangerous repercussions and tragic results that would\r\nproduce.\r\nThere is talk now about an opportunity for the\r\nresumption of the peace process according to the terms\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nof reference of the Madrid Conference. We believe that\r\nunless the two sponsors of the peace process, the\r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations, make a\r\nserious effort to implement the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions, this opportunity will be wasted again, with\r\nall the dangerous repercussions that will hold for this\r\nimportant and sensitive region of the world.\r\nThe dialogue among civilizations has gained\r\nincreasing importance in the aftermath of the escalation\r\nof hostile attacks on certain cultures, religions and\r\nnationalities. Syria, which is the cradle of early\r\ncivilizations and a source of scientific and intellectual\r\nenlightenment, recognizes the importance of this\r\ndialogue and the necessity of pursuing it in the service\r\nof humanity and future generations. Our region, at its\r\npinnacle, was a lively example of dialogue and\r\ninteraction among civilizations. Within its broad\r\nhorizons, the civilizations of East and West met.\r\nIntellectuals, men of letters, scientists and philosophers\r\nfrom different parts of the world contributed to the\r\nformation of these civilizations. In this context we\r\nhope that the Global Agenda for Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, recently adopted by the General\r\nAssembly, will be implemented. We find in this agenda\r\na horizon that responds to the aspirations of people\r\ntowards enriching the awareness of common human\r\nvalues among all peoples and deepening the spirit of\r\nunderstanding among them.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to convey to you the\r\ngratitude of my country, Syria, and its President,\r\nGovernment and people for the precious trust and the\r\ngreat support that so many countries in the world\r\nexpressed when they elected the Syrian Arab Republic\r\nto the Security Council. I would like to assure you that\r\nSyria shall remain, as it has always been, in the\r\nforefront of those who defend international legitimacy\r\nand the Charter of the United Nations and will make\r\nevery possible effort during its membership on the\r\nSecurity Council to contribute to preserving\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Vilayat Mukhtar ogly Guliyev, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Guliyev (Azerbaijan): This session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is being held at a very difficult time\r\nfor all of us. I congratulate you, Sir, on your unanimous\r\nelection to the position of President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly and I sincerely wish\r\nyou all success in guiding the work of the session and\r\nwould like to assure you of our full support.\r\nMr. Matturi (Sierra Leone), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nUnder the current circumstances, enhancement of\r\nthe United Nations effectiveness becomes increasingly\r\nimportant, and in this regard, I would like to express\r\nour special gratitude to Mr. Harri Holkeri, whose\r\nactivity as President of the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly was an example of the commitment\r\nto the revitalization process of the Organization.\r\nWe regard the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the\r\nUnited Nations and Mr. Kofi Annan as evidence of the\r\ninternational community’s recognition of the special\r\nrole played by the Organization and of the great service\r\nof its Secretary-General. Congratulating our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, I would like to stress that we place special\r\nhope in him and to reiterate our support for his\r\nactivities aimed at achieving those very objectives for\r\nthe sake of which the United Nations was created.\r\nThe Millennium Summit identified challenges in\r\nthe context of global development that can be\r\naddressed only through coordinated efforts by the\r\nentire international community within the United\r\nNations system.\r\nOne year ago, nobody could have foreseen the\r\ntragedy that would befall all of us, a tragedy that has\r\nshown the depth of the abyss before which the world\r\nfinds itself today. The dramatic events that struck the\r\nUnited States make it imperative for us to take a new\r\nlook at the aspects of global development in the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThreats and risks in the context of globalization\r\nacquire new scale and character, and the international\r\ncommunity must change its approaches accordingly.\r\nToday, an attack against one of us is considered as an\r\nattack against all of us. Will this approach become\r\nuniversal?\r\nAzerbaijan suffered from a series of horrific\r\nterrorist attacks that were part and parcel of the conflict\r\nimposed on Azerbaijan by neighbouring Armenia.\r\nUnfortunately, our warnings about the terrorist threat,\r\nas well as our appeals to the international community\r\nto join efforts in the fight against this evil, made from\r\nthis very podium, went unheeded.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nTerrorism is closely linked to aggressive\r\nseparatism and other forms of extremism, as well as to\r\norganized crime, drug and arms trafficking and other\r\nillegal activities that literally flourish in conflict zones\r\nand that provide terrorist and separatist groups with\r\nfinancial resources. Terrorism and separatism get large-\r\nscale outside support from States and private structures\r\nalike. Response to these threats must not be selective.\r\nThey can be eliminated only through adequate and\r\ncomprehensive countermeasures undertaken on the\r\nbasis of the principles and norms of international law\r\nagainst all those who use terror to achieve their goals,\r\nleaving them no hope of escaping unpunished. Nothing\r\ncan justify terrorism. There should be no room for\r\ndouble standards, palliatives or narrow national\r\ninterests.\r\nWe all have witnessed many manifestations of\r\nterrorism that have taken place in different regions of\r\nthe world, under different slogans and covers. This fact\r\nby itself clearly shows that the phenomenon of\r\nterrorism is not associated with any particular religion.\r\nHence, the fight against terrorism should not be a fight\r\nagainst a religion. We must take effective measures to\r\nreverse a dangerous trend of imprudent instigation to\r\nhostility between Islam and Christianity.\r\nThe legal, political, military and other actions\r\ntaken today by the international coalition are not the\r\nonly prerequisites for a successful fight against\r\nterrorism. It is necessary to redouble the efforts aimed\r\nat assisting and enabling the least developed countries\r\nin the process of their social and economic\r\ndevelopment to use the opportunities provided by\r\nglobalization.\r\nUnfortunately, in many regions of the world we\r\nstill see violent conflicts that claim tens of thousands\r\nof lives and undermine the sovereignty, territorial\r\nintegrity and security of States. One such example is\r\nthe conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Masking\r\nits claims to the Azerbaijani territory under the banner\r\nof the struggle for the self-determination of the\r\nArmenian population of the Nagorny-Karabakh region\r\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Republic of Armenia\r\nhas occupied this Azerbaijani territory, as well as seven\r\nadjacent regions of Azerbaijan, and has conducted\r\nethnic cleansing on the occupied territory, which has\r\nresulted in the expulsion of 1 million Azerbaijanis from\r\ntheir homes.\r\nMy country has been waiting for eight years for\r\nthe Security Council to take practical steps to\r\nimplement the following four resolutions concerning\r\nthe Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict: 822 (1993), 853\r\n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993). The Council\r\nadopted these resolutions back in 1993 in order to take\r\nenforcement measures against the aggressor, in\r\naccordance with Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nUntil now, mediation activities of the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE) Minsk Group, which is co-chaired by the\r\nUnited States, France and Russia, and which will be 10\r\nyears old next year, have not produced any results, so\r\nthe tenth anniversary may turn out to be a sad one.\r\nArmenia continues to violate the principles and\r\nnorms of international law enshrined in the United\r\nNations Charter and the OSCE Helsinki Final Act, and\r\nit ignores the provisions of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions and OSCE decisions. Rejecting this\r\ninternational legal basis for the settlement of the\r\nconflict, Armenia negotiates from the position of\r\npower and on the basis of fait accompli, trying to\r\nconsolidate the results of its armed aggression and to\r\nannex a part of Azerbaijan territory.\r\nArmenia states that there is a conflict between\r\ncertain principles of international law, but there is not a\r\nconflict between those principles. The right of self-\r\ndetermination cannot be regarded as a right to forcible\r\nseparation of a part of a State’s territory and must not\r\njustify the violation of the principle of territorial\r\nintegrity of States, in our case, that of the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan. Indeed, the real conflict is between\r\nArmenia and international law, which prevents\r\nArmenia from realizing its claims to the territory of\r\nneighbouring States.\r\nThe international community should not choose\r\nthe easiest course of action and should not recognize\r\nthe right of the powerful. Instead, it must act in\r\naccordance with the established principles and norms\r\nof international law and the decisions of international\r\norganizations.\r\nIt is unacceptable to blame both sides for the\r\ndeadlock in the negotiations, ignoring the differences\r\nbetween the compromises and concessions demanded\r\nof Azerbaijan, on the one hand, and those demanded of\r\nArmenia, on the other. The aggressor and the victim\r\ncannot be held equally responsible.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nThe Republic of Azerbaijan stands ready for a\r\nresolution of the conflict based on the principles of\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the granting of\r\nself-governance to all the people of the Nagorny-\r\nKarabakh region within the Azerbaijani State. The\r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan is prepared to provide safety\r\nand security for this region’s population.\r\nAzerbaijan is interested in a just and peaceful\r\nresolution of the conflict more than anybody else, and\r\nwe will continue to undertake all the necessary steps to\r\nachieve tangible results. But our efforts alone are not\r\nenough. Expeditious settlement of the conflict should\r\nbecome one of the main priorities for the international\r\ncommunity. There is no room for stop-gap measures\r\nand “wait-and-see” positions. The situation demands\r\nfundamental approaches and actions on everyone’s\r\npart. We expect a very significant contribution from the\r\nco-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference at the highest\r\nlevel.\r\nAzerbaijan, which for eight years has been\r\nhosting 1 million refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons, continues to face an acute humanitarian\r\nproblem that will only be resolved completely by\r\ncreating the conditions necessary for them to return to\r\ntheir homes as soon as possible. Crises in the\r\nneighbouring regions have created another problem for\r\nmy country, which now has to deal with a significant\r\nnumber of refugees from other countries. Taking all\r\nthese difficulties into consideration, we deem it\r\nnecessary for the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Baku to\r\ncontinue its functions. Currently, Azerbaijan needs\r\neven greater UNHCR assistance, as well as assistance\r\nfrom other United Nations humanitarian agencies and\r\ndonor countries. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our sincere gratitude and appreciation to all of\r\nthe aforementioned who have given their support and\r\nassistance.\r\nWe believe that in order to enhance the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of United Nations\r\nactivities in the area of the prevention of armed\r\nconflict, it is necessary to better monitor the\r\nimplementation of Security Council decisions. To this\r\nend, we propose, for general consideration, that the\r\nSecurity Council adopt the practice of submitting to the\r\nGeneral Assembly periodic reports on the\r\nimplementation of the Council’s decisions.\r\nWe deem it necessary to strengthen the capability\r\nof United Nations rapid deployment forces. The faster\r\nthe international community can react to the outbreak\r\nor resumption of a conflict, the easier peace and justice\r\nwill be restored.\r\nGlobalization should enable us to promote\r\nsustainable development and the integrity and stability\r\nof public administration systems, eliminate\r\ndiscrimination in economic activity and ensure\r\nprosperity for all peoples. Azerbaijan is contributing to\r\nmoving this process forward. We are sparing no effort\r\nto restore the Great Silk Route, to create a Europe-\r\nCaucasus-Asia transport corridor and to develop\r\ndeposits of hydrocarbons in the Caspian Sea basin and\r\ntransport them to world markets. These projects are of\r\nparamount importance in terms of the free and\r\nsustainable development of States in several regions of\r\nthe world. Furthermore, they will give impetus to\r\ntransregional cooperation and will serve as a factor that\r\ndetermines global development.\r\nThe free exploitation of natural resources and\r\ntheir transportation to world markets is the inalienable\r\nright of a sovereign State. Azerbaijan calls upon all the\r\nCaspian Sea States to refrain from the use or threat of\r\nforce in the Caspian Sea basin. The Caspian Sea must\r\nbe a sea of peace and cooperation. Azerbaijan supports\r\nearly agreement on the delimitation of the Caspian Sea\r\non the basis of principles and norms of international\r\nlaw and established practice in the use of the Caspian\r\nSea.\r\nAs a member of the group of landlocked\r\ncountries, Azerbaijan needs assistance from the\r\ninternational community to develop its transport\r\ninfrastructure in order to integrate it effectively into the\r\nglobal economy.\r\nIn its efforts to implement the concepts\r\nunderlying transregional cooperation, Azerbaijan is\r\ntaking a multi-track approach and working within the\r\nframework of a number of structures. One of them is\r\nGUUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan\r\nand Moldova), an organization consisting of five newly\r\nindependent States whose names form the acronym and\r\nwhose economies are in transition. The States members\r\nof GUUAM, which celebrate the tenth anniversary of\r\ntheir independence this year, have confronted\r\nnumerous challenges and threats during the difficult\r\nperiod of the formation and development of their\r\nstatehood. Such threats have manifested themselves\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nmost clearly during the periods of armed conflict which\r\nbroke out in three of those five member States.\r\nGUUAM stands for the speedy, peaceful settlement of\r\nconflict based on the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law enshrined in the United Nations\r\nCharter, the Helsinki Final Act of the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other\r\nrelevant documents and decisions of the United\r\nNations and OSCE.\r\nCurrently, the GUUAM member States, located in\r\nEurope, the Caucasus and Central Asia, are trying to\r\nachieve greater integration into the world economy\r\nand, to this end, are actively cooperating in creating\r\nmultidirectional transport corridors and in ensuring\r\ntheir safety and security.\r\nWithin the framework of humanitarian\r\ncooperation, we regard as very promising a GUUAM\r\ninitiative aimed at creating a Europe-Caucasus-Asia\r\ncultural corridor, which would promote cooperation in\r\nsuch areas as culture, science and education. Joint\r\nprojects in the area of tourism will also have a\r\nsignificant role to play.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) has actively assisted Azerbaijan in addressing\r\nthe development issues it faces. At the same time, the\r\nGovernment of Azerbaijan is deeply concerned by the\r\ncontinuing decrease in the core resources of UNDP.\r\nDeveloping countries and economies in transition need\r\na strong UNDP that is able to provide effective\r\nassistance in the most complex spheres of\r\ndevelopment. The Government of Azerbaijan calls\r\nupon donor countries to increase the financial base of\r\nofficial development assistance, both multilaterally and\r\nunilaterally. In distributing official development\r\nassistance special attention should be paid to the needs\r\nof African countries, the least developed countries, the\r\nsmall island States and the landlocked States.\r\nAzerbaijan places a great deal of hope in the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held in 2002. As a member of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, Azerbaijan\r\nintends to make a constructive contribution to ensure\r\nthe success of these important events and to promote\r\nthe sustainable development of weak economies.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that we all\r\nbear a tremendous responsibility. Today as never\r\nbefore, we must act wisely and use our power and\r\nresources not to escalate hatred and violence, but to\r\npromote peace and justice, stability and the\r\ndevelopment of our fragile planet.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tuliameni Kalomoh, Vice-Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Information and Broadcasting of\r\nNamibia.\r\nMr. Kalomoh (Namibia): The fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly is no ordinary one. We are\r\nmeeting in the aftermath of the despicable terrorist\r\nattacks on New York, the seat of the United Nations,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. Once again, we\r\nexpress our deep condolences to the Government and\r\nthe people of the United States. Our thoughts go out to\r\nthe families of those who lost their loved ones in those\r\ntragic and horrific events of 11 September. Namibia\r\nreiterates its unreserved condemnation of these and all\r\nother terrorist attacks, wherever they occur.\r\nIn the same vein, we express our condolences to\r\nthe families of those who perished in the American\r\nAirlines accident on 12 November. We also convey our\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the\r\nDominican Republic.\r\nNamibia also expresses its heartfelt sympathy to\r\nthe Government and the people of Algeria as they\r\nmourn the deaths of those killed by the violent storm\r\nand mudslides there. Our thoughts go out to their\r\nfamilies.\r\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo\r\non his unanimous election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session and to assure him of\r\nNamibia’s cooperation during his tenure. I would also\r\nlike to congratulate his predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for the skills he brought to the work\r\nof the General Assembly while presiding over the fifty-\r\nfifth session. Under his able leadership, we have made\r\na firm beginning to the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of the Millennium Summit.\r\nOur Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the\r\nUnited Nations have earned a place among the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize laureates. For this, as well as for his\r\nunanimous, early re-election, Namibia extends warm\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General. This, indeed,\r\nis eloquent testimony to the universal respect and\r\nadmiration he has earned from all Member States. We\r\nwish him well and assure him of our full support\r\nduring his new term of office.\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nToday we face multiple challenges, some of\r\nwhich threaten the future existence of communities and\r\nnations. With the adoption of the historic Millennium\r\nDeclaration, world leaders pledged their determination\r\nto address old as well as new obstacles hampering\r\npeace and security. A solemn commitment has thus\r\nbeen made to enhance social and economic prosperity\r\nfor all people, thereby ensuring a better world.\r\nThrough the United Nations, and with strong\r\npolitical will, no challenge is insurmountable. The\r\nUnited Nations is the only international body capable\r\nof serving the interests of all nations. It is an effective\r\nconsultative and organizational forum for world affairs,\r\nand it can create trust and confidence among nations. It\r\ncan bring peace to war-torn areas and bring relief and\r\ndevelopment to people who need it most. When\r\nsufficiently funded, its programmes and mandates can\r\nhelp developing countries to meet the challenges of\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases threatening our\r\npopulations.\r\nIt is therefore important that we, the Member\r\nStates, reaffirm our commitment to continue to\r\nstrengthen our Organization in order to effectively\r\naddress the challenges of the new millennium. In this\r\ncontext, we reiterate our call for the reform and\r\ndemocratization of the Security Council. The Security\r\nCouncil must be transparent and equitably\r\nrepresentative. Above all, it must be responsive and\r\naccountable to all States Members, on whose behalf it\r\nmaintains international peace and security.\r\nThe outcome of the historic first Conference on\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects, held in July 2001, marked an important\r\nfirst step and set achievable goals to address the\r\nproblems associated with this scourge, at all levels. It\r\nwill now require the combined efforts of the United\r\nNations, Member States and relevant international and\r\nregional organizations to ensure that rapid progress is\r\nmade to stop the proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons, which has wreaked havoc, especially on the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nTerrorism has assumed an increasingly alarming\r\nglobalized character. For some time now, the\r\nMovement of the Non-Aligned Countries has been\r\ncalling for an international conference against\r\nterrorism. The time is now right for Member States to\r\nreach a consensus on such a conference. In this respect,\r\nI wish to point out that Namibia signed, on 10\r\nNovember 2001, the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and we call\r\non others to do likewise.\r\nAt the 1990 World Summit for Children we made\r\na collective commitment to put children first, take care\r\nof and educate them and protect them from harm,\r\nexploitation, war and abuse. Yet too many children in\r\ntoo many parts of the world are still deprived of a\r\npeaceful childhood. Let us seize the occasion of the\r\ntwenty-seventh special session of the General\r\nAssembly, on children, to take effective measures to\r\nmake the world fit for all our children.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached\r\ncatastrophic proportions. The Secretary-General\r\nreminded us that nearly 22 million people have died of\r\nHIV/AIDS and that out of more than 36 million people\r\ninfected worldwide by HIV/AIDS, 25.3 million live in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. Thus, if indeed we are to succeed\r\nin reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015, as world\r\nleaders committed themselves to doing in so many\r\nforums, then Governments, civil society and the private\r\nsector must, in strong partnership, tackle HIV/AIDS. In\r\nthis connection, the establishment of the Global AIDS\r\nand Health Fund to combat the AIDS epidemic and\r\nother communicable diseases is a welcome initiative\r\nwhich calls for generous contributions.\r\nThe World Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,\r\nheld in Durban, South Africa, was the beginning of a\r\nprocess undertaken by the international community to\r\naddress the inhuman and brutal treatment of the victims\r\nof the dehumanizing practice of slavery and\r\ncolonialism, especially the African people. The trans-\r\nAtlantic slave trade and the colonization of the African\r\npeoples remain the darkest and most humiliating\r\nepisode in the history of the African continent. The\r\nhealing process will be enhanced only if and when\r\nthose who committed and benefited from slavery and\r\ncolonialism accept their full responsibility.\r\nNamibia applauds the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), designed to bring\r\nto justice those individuals accused of the most serious\r\ncrimes of concern to the international community.\r\nRecently, the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) adopted the Windhoek Plan of\r\nAction on ICC Ratification and Implementation,\r\ndesigned to promote early ratification of the ICC treaty.\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nNamibia is currently reviewing its national legislation\r\nto prepare for the ratification of the treaty.\r\nThe knowledge-based global economy has\r\nrevolutionized the nature of trade, finance,\r\nemployment, migration, the environment and social\r\nsystems, as well as the concept and application of\r\ngovernance.\r\nNamibia, like other countries of the South,\r\nexpects tangible results from the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nnext year in Mexico. It is in the interest of North-South\r\nand South-South cooperation that additional options be\r\nexplored to mobilize financing for development.\r\nSimilarly, the fourth Ministerial Meeting of the World\r\nTrade Organization, in Doha, Qatar, could pave the\r\nway to an equitable international trading system that is\r\nmutually beneficial to all countries, provided that\r\npolitical will prevails.\r\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development,\r\nto be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, next year\r\nshould galvanize momentum for the full\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21, in particular the\r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibility.\r\nDesertification, land erosion and land degradation\r\nshould be given due and appropriate consideration.\r\nAfrica has recently taken an important step\r\ntowards greater unity and cohesion with the\r\ntransformation of the Organization of African Unity\r\ninto the African Union. This momentous step would\r\nbring about closer integration of the continent and\r\nwould make Africa more competitive in an\r\nincreasingly global market. Furthermore, the heads of\r\nState and Government adopted the New African\r\nInitiative, now the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment, whose primary objective is the\r\neradication of poverty through sustained economic\r\ngrowth and sustainable development. We call on the\r\ninternational community to support and assist African\r\ncountries in the implementation of this New\r\nPartnership.\r\nLet me stress that the initiatives undertaken by\r\nJapan, the People’s Republic of China, the United\r\nStates, under the third Tokyo International Conference\r\non African Development, the China-Africa Forum and\r\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act respectively\r\ncan complement the efforts of African countries for\r\nsustained economic growth.\r\nWe congratulate the people of East Timor on their\r\nstruggle for independence and on conducting\r\nsuccessful elections for their first Constituent\r\nAssembly. We commend the United Nations for its\r\nimportant role in East Timor. We wish the people of\r\nEast Timor every success in the reconstruction and\r\nrehabilitation of their country. We call on the\r\ninternational community to be generous in its support\r\nof the East Timorese people in this most challenging\r\nphase of their nationhood.\r\nThe eleventh of November this year marks 26\r\nyears of the independence of the Republic of Angola.\r\nBut for more than a quarter of a century, the people of\r\nAngola have endured a brutal and devastating war.\r\nThey have suffered horrendous terrorist attacks against\r\ncivilian targets, including most recently attacks on a\r\npassenger train, on school buses, the kidnapping of\r\nschoolchildren, attacks on hospitals and the wanton\r\ndestruction of infrastructure; all at the hands of\r\nUNITA. Tens of thousands of innocent men, women\r\nand children have been killed. Their agricultural fields\r\nare infested with landmines. Angola has acquired the\r\ndubious distinction of having the largest number of\r\namputees and the greatest number of landmines. This is\r\nnot right; it cannot be right. These heinous atrocities\r\ncommitted by UNITA, as well as that group’s\r\nconsistent record of duplicity and always negotiating in\r\nbad faith, compelled SADC, in 1998, to declare\r\nSavimbi, UNITA’s leader, a war criminal.\r\nFor its part, having determined convincingly that\r\nUNITA is responsible for the violations of the Lusaka\r\nProtocol and the resumption of the war, the United\r\nNations Security Council imposed sanctions against\r\nUNITA. While sanctions have been effective in many\r\nimportant respects, more concrete measures need to be\r\ntaken by Member States to strengthen them and make\r\nthem even more effective. African countries have a\r\nbigger and special obligation in this regard. Sanctions\r\nmust be tightened in those areas identified by the\r\nMonitoring Mechanism on Sanctions against UNITA,\r\nsuch as the freezing of UNITA assets and bank\r\naccounts and the closing down of UNITA\r\nrepresentations abroad, which now operate under\r\nmisleading and innocuous sounding appellations but\r\nwhich in fact continue to promote UNITA activities\r\nand advocate its wicked cause. The international\r\ncommunity should respond more decisively to repeated\r\ndefiance of Security Council resolutions by UNITA. By\r\nacting more resolutely against UNITA, the\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\ninternational community will help end the prolonged\r\nsuffering, tears and agony of the people of Angola.\r\nRegarding the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Namibia is encouraged by the progress made in\r\nthe implementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire\r\nAgreement. The ceasefire has been holding so far\r\ndespite some violations and infringements, particularly\r\nin the eastern part of the country. The continued\r\noccupation by forces of aggression has created\r\ndeplorable human suffering and large-scale human\r\nrights violations in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. Namibia, once again wishes to remind the\r\nMembers of the United Nations that a cardinal\r\nprinciple of the Charter of this Organization has been\r\nviolated with impunity, when some of its Members\r\ncommitted an act of naked aggression against the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. It is even more\r\ndeplorable when the aggressor countries are engaged in\r\nthe ruthless exploitation and plundering of the natural\r\nresources of the Congo. We reiterate here that\r\naggression should be rejected and condemned\r\nwhenever and wherever it occurs. There should be no\r\ndouble standards when it comes to the violation of the\r\nprinciples of the Charter with regard to aggression. The\r\ninternational community should also assist the people\r\nof the Congo in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of\r\ntheir country.\r\nNow it is time for the Security Council to\r\nimplement its decisions without further delay and\r\napprove the personnel for phase III of the deployment\r\nof the United Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), taking\r\nfully into account the demands and requirements of\r\nthat peacekeeping operation — the size of the country\r\nand the non-existence of the infrastructure. The United\r\nNations and the international community cannot fail\r\nthe people of the Congo this time around.\r\nWe are gratified by the increased efforts of the\r\nSecurity Council and the serious attention paid by the\r\ninternational community to Sierra Leone, which have\r\nnow started to pay off. The international community\r\nshould remain actively engaged and continue to assist\r\nwith the peace-building and reconstruction of the\r\npeace-loving people of Sierra Leone.\r\nHistory teaches us that no administrative Power\r\nhas relinquished authority as a gesture of good will,\r\nthat no peace process has been problem-free and that\r\nparties to a conflict, naturally, will have differences.\r\nThis notwithstanding, however, no amount of\r\ndifficulties can justify abandonment of the United\r\nNations Settlement Plan for Western Sahara. Any\r\nattempt to legitimize, in whatever form or shape, the\r\npresent situation in Western Sahara is unjustifiable and\r\nis a departure from the United Nations Declaration on\r\ndecolonization and relevant General Assembly and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Ignoring the legitimate\r\naspirations of the brave Sahrawi people will only delay\r\ndurable peace in the region. A departure from the\r\nUnited Nations Settlement Plan will deny the Sahrawi\r\npeople their inalienable right to self-determination and\r\nindependence. Namibia will reject and will dissociate\r\nitself from any plan, informal or otherwise, to deny the\r\nSahrawi people their legitimate right to express\r\nthemselves through a free, fair and impartial\r\nreferendum for self-determination.\r\nNo people can maintain peace and security or\r\nbuild its prosperity on the helplessness and abject\r\nmisery of others, particularly their neighbours. The\r\npeople of Palestine and, indeed, the international\r\ncommunity are crying out for the establishment of the\r\nPalestinian State. They are crying out for peace\r\nbetween Palestine and the State of Israel. It is now time\r\nto heed this call. The legitimate right of the people of\r\nPalestine to self-determination and the establishment of\r\nan independent State of their own cannot be denied and\r\ncannot be compromised. A Palestinian State will be in\r\nthe best interests of Israel, of security and peace, of the\r\nentire Middle East and of the whole world. The basis\r\nfor a just and lasting peace in the Middle East remains\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973).\r\nLet us make sustained and determined collective\r\nefforts to promote peace and development in all corners\r\nof the world, so that our children and grandchildren can\r\nlive in a peaceful world.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Gediminas Šerkšnys, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Lithuania.\r\nMr. Šerkšnys (Lithuania): Let me at the outset\r\nexpress our deepest condolences to the families of the\r\nvictims of Monday’s tragic accident in Queens, New\r\nYork.\r\nI am particularly pleased to see Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo guiding the General Assembly during this session.\r\nI wish to assure him of my delegation’s fullest support\r\nin all his endeavours. I would like also to extend my\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his election to a\r\nsecond term of office as Secretary-General.\r\nIt is also with great satisfaction that we join other\r\nspeakers in congratulating Mr. Kofi Annan on having\r\nbeen awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. We are proud that\r\nthe one hundredth Nobel Prize also honoured the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. As rightly pointed out by\r\nthe Secretary-General, this “challenges us to do more\r\nand to do better”. It is our responsibility to ensure that\r\nthe Organization is at the forefront of efforts to achieve\r\npeace and security in the world.\r\nThis year Lithuania is celebrating the tenth\r\nanniversary of its membership in the United Nations.\r\nOn 17 September 1991, our nation proudly watched as\r\nthe Lithuanian flag was raised for the first time at the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the 10 years that have elapsed, we have seen a\r\nrapid transformation in the world order. The world\r\naround us has shrunk with incredible speed. The\r\nbenefits accruing from globalization have made us\r\nmore dependent upon each other and thus more\r\nvulnerable to complex phenomena that affect the\r\nstability and security of our societies.\r\nTerrorism does not recognize national borders. It\r\nspills over into international terrain, no matter how\r\ningenious the defences are that have been put in place.\r\nOnly through the common efforts of the international\r\ncommunity will it be possible to create successful\r\ndefence mechanisms. Indeed, on 11 September, the\r\nworld grasped the sheer magnitude of the defences that\r\nwill be required.\r\nTerrorism is closely linked to extreme poverty,\r\nmarginalization, human rights violations, ethnic strife,\r\nthe proliferation of arms and drug trafficking. Thus, it\r\nis essential in the long term to devise and carry out an\r\nanti-terrorism policy that is inclusive and spans all\r\nregions and continents.\r\nI wish to express once again from this rostrum my\r\nnation’s strong condemnation of terrorist actions and to\r\nreaffirm our solidarity with the people of the United\r\nStates. We are determined to stand alongside the\r\ninternational community in combating terrorism. In the\r\nimmediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks, Lithuania\r\nsupported the actions taken by the European Union and\r\nthe North Atlantic Alliance, including the decision of\r\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to\r\ninvoke article 5 of the Washington Treaty. My\r\nGovernment has decided to grant permanent diplomatic\r\nclearance for the overflight and landing of United\r\nStates Government aircraft.\r\nAn important step aimed at combating and\r\npreventing terrorism was the adoption of an\r\nunprecedented Security Council resolution: resolution\r\n1373 (2001). Now it is up to Governments to act\r\nwithout delay in following through the detailed\r\nrequirements of the resolution.\r\nThe General Assembly should also make its own\r\ncontribution, first of all, by speeding up its work on the\r\ndraft comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism.\r\nDomestic legal steps to be taken by Member\r\nStates include ratification of the 12 United Nations\r\nmultilateral instruments directly designed for the\r\nsuppression of terrorism. Lithuania has already stepped\r\nup its efforts to accede to the remaining five\r\nConventions.\r\nIn this endeavour, the experience and practice of\r\nother international bodies in the fight against terrorism\r\nshould not be forgotten. For instance, the Council of\r\nEurope has successfully elaborated a number of\r\ntreaties, such as the European Convention on the\r\nSuppression of Terrorism, the European Convention on\r\nExtradition and its Protocols, and so on. The\r\nexperience of this regional organization could also be\r\nused in the field of crime prevention, money-\r\nlaundering and corruption. It is noteworthy that\r\ninstruments of the European treaty system are also\r\nopen to non-member States.\r\nJust last week — meeting in Warsaw at a\r\nconference of heads of State of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope on the common fight against terrorism — 17\r\nleaders from the region, including from my own\r\ncountry, adopted a declaration on cooperation in the\r\ncombat against terrorism and a plan of action against\r\nterrorism. It is aimed at improving cooperation among\r\nintelligence, customs and police services and cracking\r\ndown on money-laundering and drug trafficking.\r\nThe challenges posed by a globalized world are\r\nmultifarious and interrelated. They require diverse and\r\nversatile actions. Therefore, due consideration and\r\nresources should be devoted to the problems of arms\r\ncontrol and disarmament, as well as to poverty\r\neradication and sustainable development.\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nIn this regard, I would like to note the resolution\r\nadopted just a few weeks ago by the First Committee\r\non multilateral cooperation in the area of disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation and on global efforts against\r\nterrorism. It puts a clear focus on multilateral efforts to\r\ncombat international terrorism and fight proliferation.\r\nThe results of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) article XIV Conference have\r\nrekindled the hope that widespread concerns about the\r\ndelayed entry into force of the Treaty will be taken into\r\naccount. We also hope that the implementation of the\r\n13 steps agreed upon at the 2000 Review Conference\r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) will not be put on hold. Likewise,\r\nintensive bilateral consultations between the United\r\nStates and the Russian Federation on a new strategic\r\nframework will, it is hoped, foster a common\r\nunderstanding and provide a basis for deep reductions\r\nin all classes of nuclear weapons, consistent with the\r\ncommitments under article VI of the NPT.\r\nStrengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons\r\nConvention also remains an urgent priority.\r\nThe 2001 Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has yielded\r\na Programme of Action, a strategy and the political\r\nmomentum to deal with the proliferation and misuse of\r\nsmall arms. There needs to be a follow-up process to\r\ntackle their brokering, marking and transportation and\r\nto build upon the measures agreed thus far. In the\r\nmeantime, we believe that the strict implementation of\r\nthe Programme of Action will bring about a real\r\nchange at the end of the day.\r\nHistory has proved that democratic, prosperous\r\nStates provide the most favourable environment for\r\nhuman activities. The United Nations should therefore\r\ncontinue its efforts to promote democratization and\r\nsustainable development. I would also like to\r\nunderscore the need to pay even greater attention to the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights.\r\nToday we face the challenges of a globalized\r\nworld, which are the result of rapidly developing\r\ntechnologies and human negligence. These challenges,\r\nalthough not as evident as open military conflicts, are\r\nno less threatening. A devastated and deteriorating\r\nenvironment could cause conflicts of an unprecedented\r\nscale.\r\nNo effort should be spared to free people from the\r\ndehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.\r\nAssistance, new trade arrangements and debt relief\r\nshould be complemented by firm commitments to\r\npoverty reduction, economic equality and measures to\r\nsupport education; they should be reflected first and\r\nforemost in the national policies of individual States\r\nand, at the same time, on the agendas of international\r\norganizations. In this regard, we commit ourselves to\r\nensuring successful preparation for the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nThe Summit, in Johannesburg, should make\r\nconcrete contributions to the eradication of poverty and\r\nthe promotion of sustainable modes of production and\r\nconsumption. In this regard, the Government of\r\nLithuania, in its domestic policy, aims at economic\r\ndevelopment that does not harm the overall quality of\r\nthe environment. Priority is given to promoting\r\ninvestment aimed at the prevention of pollution,  the\r\nuse of clean fuel and energy sources and the\r\nintroduction of low-waste and other progressive\r\nenvironmental technologies.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment should focus on better mobilization and\r\nmore effective use of financial resources and find ways\r\nfor more efficient cooperation between all development\r\nactors. The meeting will set strategic goals of policy\r\ncoherence in order to integrate into the world economy\r\ncountries with differing levels of economic\r\ndevelopment. The Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nprivate sector should play important roles in the\r\ndevelopment process.\r\nThe events of 11 September have proved how\r\nfragile international security can be. Moreover, in\r\ndefence of our common values — freedom, democracy\r\nand openness — no nation can idly stand by or act\r\nunilaterally. Every nation must pull its own weight in\r\ncontributing to regional and international stability.\r\nStrengthening dialogue and understanding among\r\nnations and civilizations should also remain in the\r\nforefront of our thinking. Better understanding and\r\nidentified common values will foster trust and\r\ntolerance among people, preventing the spread of\r\nfanaticism, violence and terrorism. Lithuania made its\r\ncontribution to these goals by hosting the International\r\nConference on Dialogue among Civilizations in April\r\nthis year.\r\nIt is of crucial importance to Lithuania to\r\nparticipate actively in international organizations and\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nto contribute to peacekeeping efforts. We have\r\ncontinued to provide our civilian police officers to\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations through the\r\nUnited Nations Standby Arrangements System. Our\r\ntroops have been serving in the Balkans since the very\r\nbeginning of the international engagement in that\r\nregion. Just a few days ago, a Lithuanian medical\r\nsquad, a small, but much-needed contribution to the\r\nUnited Nations, was placed under the Standby\r\nArrangements System. Shortly, Lithuania will submit\r\nits application for full-fledged membership in the\r\nUnited Nations Standby Forces High-Readiness\r\nBrigade.\r\nMembership in the European Union and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization will solidify our region’s\r\ninstitutional, economic and security ties. Lithuania is\r\nsparing no effort in preparing for the challenges of a\r\nunified pan-Atlantic family of democracies. The work\r\nof the Vilnius 10 group, initiated a few years ago and\r\nlaunched in Vilnius, is proof of the ability of the\r\nregion’s States to promote transparency, partnership\r\nand common values.\r\nAt the subregional level, Lithuania stresses\r\npractical cooperative efforts to promote democratic and\r\neconomic transformation throughout the region. Over\r\nthe last decade, our engagement with Poland has\r\nbecome a close partnership. Dynamic trilateral Baltic\r\ncooperation has become part of broader Baltic-Nordic\r\ncooperation. Excellent cross-border cooperation with\r\nthe Kaliningrad region has given rise to many dynamic\r\ndevelopments.\r\nJust a couple of days ago, on 8 November,\r\nLithuania assumed the chairmanship of the Committee\r\nof Ministers of the Council of Europe. The Council of\r\nEurope, based on the common values of pluralist\r\ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law, already\r\nhas a history of cooperation with the United Nations\r\nand its agencies, most notably in the field of human\r\nrights. Recent joint efforts by the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\nand the Council of Europe to facilitate recovery of\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe have proved to be of the utmost\r\nsignificance for the people of the region, and have\r\nopened a new chapter of cooperation between these\r\norganizations.\r\nDuring its chairmanship, Lithuania will seek to\r\nstimulate dialogue between the Council of Europe and\r\nthe United Nations and its specialized agencies. We\r\nencourage a regular exchange of views on issues\r\nrelated to the fight against and prevention of terrorism,\r\norganized crime and money-laundering. Intensive\r\ncoordination with regard to setting standards for\r\npluralist democracy and respect for human rights will\r\nalso be promoted.\r\nIn the work of the Council of Europe, the\r\nLithuanian chairmanship will focus mainly on fighting\r\nterrorism, supporting the enlargement process of the\r\nCouncil of Europe, promoting regional cooperation and\r\nensuring the effective functioning of the organization.\r\nWith the aim of building a modern pan-European\r\nsociety, we will keep working to establish a wider\r\nEuropean identity, sharing the best practices of the\r\nCouncil of Europe with other organizations and States,\r\nand strengthening the impact of the Council of Europe.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Alfred Carlot, Chairman of the delegation of the\r\nRepublic of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Carlot (Vanuatu): At the outset, I wish to\r\nextend to Mr. Han Seung-soo greetings from the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of\r\nVanuatu. I wish to convey to him the apologies of my\r\nGovernment for not being able to be represented here\r\nat the ministerial level owing to the fact that our\r\nParliament is currently in session. I should also like to\r\ntake this opportunity to convey my Government’s\r\ncongratulations to him on his election as President of\r\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I also\r\npay tribute to his predecessor, who so ably played a\r\ndecisive role at the helm of the fifty-fifth session.\r\nIn addition, allow me to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his election to a\r\nsecond term at the head of this esteemed world body.\r\nHis assured wisdom and compassion are needed now\r\nmore than ever to lead this Organization.\r\nI have the great honour, in standing before the\r\nAssembly today, to deliver a statement on behalf of my\r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of Vanuatu\r\nat a time so sad that words cannot begin to convey the\r\nscope of our emotions. Let me express the sincere\r\nsympathy and condolences of my Government and the\r\npeople of Vanuatu to the families and friends of the\r\nvictims of the tragedy that struck downtown New York,\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. In light of these\r\nevents, since the 11 September attacks, the General\r\nAssembly has been forced to suspend most of its\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nagenda, including this general debate among heads of\r\nState and Government.\r\nIt is ironic that as the world becomes more\r\ncivilized, we become more vulnerable to such inhuman\r\nacts of terrorism. The impacts of these terrorist\r\nactivities are being felt around the globe, and small\r\nStates such as mine will suffer along with the rest of\r\nthe international community. If any good has come out\r\nof the despicable events of 11 September, it is that\r\nnations the world over are more united than ever in\r\ncondemning and collaborating to eradicate these\r\nterrible acts of terrorism. My Government has taken\r\nsteps to tighten security and is working closely with\r\nother Pacific island States towards building and\r\nstrengthening peace and security in our region.\r\nGlobal peace and security cannot be certain in\r\nthis climate of continued difference of views between\r\nmajor nuclear-weapon States. The lack of progress on\r\nthis is reflected by the stalemate prevailing in the\r\nConference on Disarmament. The agreements reached\r\nduring the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons were not realized; the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has not entered into force; and\r\nglobal military expenditures continue to rise. More\r\ncommitted efforts and innovative strategies are needed\r\nto meet the goals of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nVanuatu believes that the Conference on Disarmament\r\nshould work towards that end.\r\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the\r\nLeast Developed Countries, held in Brussels in May\r\nthis year, was highly successful and produced the\r\nBrussels Declaration and the Programme of Action for\r\nLeast Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010.\r\nWe appreciate the view of the Secretary-General that\r\nthe Declaration reaffirms the collective responsibility\r\nof the international community to uphold the principles\r\nof human dignity, equality and equity and to ensure\r\nthat globalization becomes a positive force for all the\r\nworld’s people. We believe that without the\r\ncoordinated involvement of the whole United Nations\r\nsystem, there will be little the United Nations can\r\nachieve.\r\nThe Government of Vanuatu, like other\r\nGovernments around the world, is committed to\r\nenhancing the status of women. It is well documented\r\nthat women in Vanuatu are disadvantaged in almost all\r\nsectors. In 1995, Vanuatu unanimously ratified the\r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\r\nDiscrimination against Women. Accordingly, the\r\nGovernment of Vanuatu is focusing on the Convention\r\nas the basis for programmes on women’s rights and\r\ndevelopment in Vanuatu.\r\nA lack of resources has hindered Vanuatu’s\r\nprogress in submitting its first two reports. The\r\nGovernment, however, recognizes the importance of\r\nthe reports in terms of building up and monitoring its\r\nown human resources development requirements and is\r\nthus putting greater effort into the production of these\r\nreports. Indeed, no country can afford to waste half of\r\nits human resources.\r\nVanuatu remains steadfast in its commitments and\r\nobligations under the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. Since ratifying the Convention in 1992, the\r\nGovernment of Vanuatu has implemented decisions and\r\nundertaken activities that promote the advancement of\r\nchildren in our society. A National Children’s\r\nCommittee, whose membership is made up of\r\nstakeholders, has been revived and is officially\r\nrecognized as the regulatory body for coordinating and\r\nsupervising children’s rights throughout the nation.\r\nThe electoral assistance provided by the United\r\nNations for Fiji’s national election has greatly\r\nfacilitated the democratic transition in that country. We\r\nwelcome the new focus on supporting institutions and\r\nstimulating local participation. We also welcome other\r\nefforts to deploy the Electoral Assistance Division to\r\ncoordinate the activities of foreign observers in\r\nforthcoming elections, particularly in East Timor and\r\nhopefully in Solomon Islands. We commend the United\r\nNations for its assistance in empowering the citizens of\r\nMember States to enjoy the power of democracy.\r\nWe recognize the efforts of the United Nations in\r\nbridging the gap between human rights norms and their\r\nimplementation. Despite some progress, challenges\r\nremain in ensuring universal respect for human rights.\r\nThe Republic of Vanuatu is a party to nearly all core\r\nhuman rights treaties. We feel there is a continuing\r\nneed for human and institutional capacity-building in\r\ndeveloping countries in order to ensure the\r\nimplementation of human rights conventions and\r\ntreaties they have signed. This is an area where the\r\nUnited Nations should follow a needs-based approach\r\nand make a realistic assessment of the existing\r\nmechanisms.\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nThe East Timorese people, who have already\r\nelected their Constituent Assembly, will democratically\r\nelect their President and soon exercise full sovereignty\r\nover their entire territory; this positive development is\r\na big leap. It affirms the outstanding commitment of\r\nthe Committee of 24 in deliberating on the right of\r\npeoples to self-determination. However, there are those\r\nwho are still waiting to exercise this right. At this\r\nsession’s general debate, I am pleased to note that the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization gives special mention to West Papua. The\r\nSecretary-General intends to enhance our efforts to\r\nassist Indonesia in seeking to establish a democratic\r\nsociety and in addressing the wide range of complex\r\nissues facing that country. The Secretary-General also\r\nunderlined the efforts of the Indonesian authorities to\r\nfurther the promotion of human rights and find\r\npeaceful resolutions to the problems in West Papua,\r\nAceh and Maluku. During the thirty-second Pacific\r\nIslands Forum in Nauru, Forum leaders expressed\r\ncontinuing concern about violence and loss of life in\r\nthe Indonesian province of West Papua. The Forum\r\nalso called on the Indonesian authorities to ensure to\r\nthat the voices of all parties in West Papua be heard in\r\norder to achieve a peaceful resolution. Our leaders\r\nwelcomed the recent presentation of special autonomy\r\nproposals to Indonesia’s national assembly, while\r\nurging all parties to protect and uphold the human\r\nrights of all residents in West Papua.\r\nI am extremely pleased to inform the Assembly\r\nthat the Government of Vanuatu has agreed to host the\r\nSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization seminar in\r\nPort Vila, Vanuatu, in May of next year. We look\r\nforward to that important meeting.\r\nThe Republic of Vanuatu wishes to join others in\r\nexpressing our appreciation to the Secretary-General\r\nfor his comprehensive report on the implementation of\r\nthe recommendations of the Special Committee on\r\nPeacekeeping Operations and of the Panel on United\r\nNations Peace Operations. Vanuatu is a new supporter\r\nof the United Nations peacekeeping role in East Timor\r\nand Bosnia and has contributed civilian police to these\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping initiatives. The Vanuatu\r\nGovernment remains committed to future peacekeeping\r\nengagements. Vanuatu has also monitored the\r\nBougainville peace process alongside the United\r\nNations.\r\nOne of the more pressing issues before us is that\r\nof climate change and sea-level rise. The United\r\nNations has now scheduled a World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, to be held in Johannesburg,\r\nSouth Africa, in September of next year.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum communiqué reflected\r\non climate change in seeking the international\r\ncommunity’s awareness of our low-lying islands in the\r\nPacific and reiterating the priority of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol as a significant step forward for global action\r\nin combating climate change. Although signed by\r\nmany of the industrialized countries, including the\r\nUnited States, the Kyoto Protocol has not yet been\r\nratified by many of them. We are very concerned that\r\nthe United States Senate has actually voted against\r\nratification.\r\nOur Forum leaders noted the concerns expressed\r\nby most members over the United States intention not\r\nto ratify the Kyoto Protocol. We urge the United States\r\nto reconsider its position and to ratify the Kyoto\r\nProtocol as soon as possible.\r\nWhile the incidence of HIV/AIDS is not as high\r\nin the Pacific as in some other regions, it is\r\nnevertheless a major issue for both developing and\r\ndeveloped countries within our region. Vanuatu’s\r\ndelegation is of the firm view that prevention should be\r\nthe mainstay of combating HIV/AIDS in our region.\r\nThe relatively low number of reported HIV/AIDS\r\ncases in a number of our countries should not give rise\r\nto complacency. Once the disease takes hold, care and\r\ntreatment can be extremely expensive. In this respect,\r\nVanuatu welcomes the establishment of a Global Fund\r\nto combat HIV/AIDS, and we wish to express our\r\nappreciation to those Governments, foundations and\r\nprivate companies that have already expressed support.\r\nMeanwhile, strategies and plans for resource\r\nmobilization must keep in mind the competing\r\npriorities of, and the constraints faced by, smaller\r\nStates like Vanuatu.\r\nIn conclusion, the Vanuatu delegation reaffirms\r\nits support and conviction for the crucial role that the\r\nUnited Nations has in ensuring that the world becomes\r\na much safer place in which to live.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Egypt.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nAllow me to read the statement that was to be delivered\r\nby the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Arab\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nRepublic of Egypt, Mr. Ahmed Maher El Sayed, who,\r\nunfortunately, was unable to come to New York to\r\nparticipate in this important debate.\r\n“It gives me pleasure to express through\r\nyou, Sir, to the friendly people of Korea, my most\r\nsincere congratulations on the confidence\r\nbestowed by the General Assembly upon\r\nPresident Han Seung-soo in his election as\r\nPresident of the current session. I would like to\r\nassure him of our full cooperation in ensuring the\r\nsuccess of our work. With my personal\r\nknowledge of his abilities, experience and skills, I\r\nam fully confident that our efforts will be\r\ncrowned with success through the activation of\r\nthe Charter and the strengthening of its\r\ncontribution to the building of a better world.\r\n“We gather here under extremely sensitive\r\ncircumstances born from injustice and violence.\r\nWe must face them resolutely and boldly so as\r\nnot to allow the forces of evil to overcome our\r\naspirations, which cause us to gather here every\r\nyear. Among the circumstances which I would\r\nlike to highlight here today is, first, the continued\r\ndenial of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople, including their right to the establishment\r\nof their independent State on the territories\r\noccupied since June 1967, including East\r\nJerusalem. The second circumstance I wish to\r\nmention is the harrowing events that took place in\r\nthe United States as a result of criminal terrorist\r\nacts that took a heavy toll in innocent lives.\r\nThirdly, peoples continue to suffer from violence,\r\npoverty, underdevelopment and injustice. We are\r\nduty-bound to stand united against these\r\nphenomena, because the oppression of one people\r\nis the oppression of all peoples, the killing of one\r\nsoul is the same as killing the entire world, a\r\nchild who goes to bed hungry spells hunger for\r\nthe whole world and the demolition of a single\r\nhome condemns the whole of humanity to sleep\r\nin the wilderness, deprived of the shelter of\r\nlegitimacy and law.\r\n“The events of 11 September in the United\r\nStates were not the beginning of terrorism. We\r\nhave been suffering from terrorism for many\r\nyears. We stood alone in combating it and\r\novercoming the obstacles placed by some,\r\ndeliberately or unwittingly, in the path of our\r\nstruggle, until it was vanquished. The tragic\r\nevents of 11 September have brought the whole\r\nquestion into the sharp focus of international\r\nconcern. This fact was reflected in a resolute\r\ninternational consensus to deal not only with the\r\nmanifestations of terrorism but also with its root\r\ncauses.\r\n“There is a consensus to address terrorism\r\nwithin the framework of international law, as\r\nrepresented by this great Organization, through\r\nthe use of a whole range of actions. These include\r\nlegislation, laws, security measures and the\r\ndissemination of enlightened thought. There must\r\nalso be a constant search for justice, truth and\r\ndevelopment. For the battle against terrorism to\r\nbe successful, it must extend to all aspects of life,\r\nincluding the political, economic, social, cultural\r\nand security aspects.\r\n“A search for the root causes is not a\r\njustification, rather, a diagnosis. A disease cannot\r\nbe cured by dealing with the symptoms alone;\r\nthere must, rather, be a thorough analysis and a\r\nthorough investigation of the germs that spew\r\nvenom in human hearts, souls and bodies.\r\nDiscovering the pathogen opens the path for\r\neffective treatment.\r\n“No germ is more lethal to the future of\r\nhumanity than that of poverty. We look forward\r\nto the forthcoming United Nations International\r\nConference on Financing for Development to be\r\nheld in Mexico; we hope that it will result in a\r\nnew international consensus on an international\r\neconomic framework serving the interests of all\r\nStates, developed and developing alike. We also\r\nhope that it will create a new spirit of\r\nconstructive partnership among all members of\r\nthe international community. This partnership\r\nshould seek to eliminate the imbalances of\r\nglobalization, to maximize the opportunity for all\r\nto benefit from it and to achieve prosperity and\r\npolitical and economic stability.\r\n“In this context, I would like to highlight\r\nthe new initiative adopted by the African leaders\r\nat their recent summit in Lusaka to combat\r\npoverty and build a brighter future for the peoples\r\nof the continent — namely, the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). This\r\ninitiative reflects a clear vision of the spirit of our\r\ntimes and a recognition by the peoples of Africa\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nof the reality that they bear the primary\r\nresponsibility for determining their future and for\r\neliminating the political, social and economic\r\nobstacles standing before them. We look forward\r\nto the international community providing the\r\nnecessary backing and support for this\r\nconstructive collective action in order to ensure a\r\nsuccessful outcome to the efforts aimed at the\r\ndevelopment, stability and prosperity in Africa.\r\n“At the same time, it is important to prevent\r\nthe spread of another disease: the so-called clash\r\nof civilizations and religions, which could\r\nundermine all of the progress made by humanity\r\nso far towards constructive interaction and\r\ncoexistence. Therefore, we call for the convening\r\nof an international conference to lay the\r\nfoundation for cooperation among all States\r\nagainst terrorism. The conference should define\r\nthe obligations of States, from which there can be\r\nno deviation. It should chart the path towards the\r\ncomplete elimination of this scourge. It is\r\nanathema to the right of all peoples to live in an\r\natmosphere of security, equality and justice that\r\nenables all to build the edifices of prosperity and\r\nprogress.\r\n“We also call for a genuine dialogue among\r\ncivilizations that would turn diversity into a\r\nconstructive force for mutual enrichment and\r\ndeep enlightenment. Such dialogue should allow\r\nus all to avoid surrendering to the forces of\r\nbarbarism, which wish to fabricate a clash or a\r\nconflict where there is none. There is but one\r\nsingle, unified march towards a better world.\r\nDifferences will not disappear in that better\r\nworld; what will disappear are the rejection,\r\nhumiliation and persecution of others on the\r\ngrounds of religion, race or gender.\r\n“That is the true sense of globalization that\r\nwe must uphold. It must be an expression of\r\ninterdependence among the peoples and countries\r\nof the world and of the exchange of human and\r\nsocial experience and economic and technological\r\npotential. Globalization means dealing with the\r\nchanging world in a spirit of understanding that\r\ndoes not attempt to impose or control — a spirit\r\nthat does not claim absolute distinction or attempt\r\nto impose hegemony under any pretext. With this\r\nspirit, an all-encompassing democracy will\r\nemerge in international life. All States, big and\r\nsmall, will make their contribution to global\r\nadvancement through their implementation of the\r\nprinciples adopted by the world after painful\r\nexperience of war and disasters.\r\n“This leads me to address a worrisome\r\nphenomenon that has grown stronger since the\r\ntragic events of 11 September: the attempt to\r\nassociate the charges of terrorism and\r\nbackwardness with Islam and the resultant\r\npersecution of Arabs and Muslims. This attempt\r\ncan spring only from ignorance and blind\r\nprejudice. Islam is a religion based on truth,\r\njustice and respect for human rights, particularly\r\nthe right to life and to be free from poverty,\r\nignorance and disease. In Islam, people have the\r\nduty to interact with others through fair means,\r\nunderstanding and mutual respect.\r\n“I commend those Governments, including\r\nthe United States Government, that have taken\r\nmeasures to put an end to such heinous practices,\r\nwhich recall the dark ages. Nevertheless, we all\r\nneed to do much more to reveal the truth and to\r\ndispel the darkness of ignorance and arrogance.\r\nAll must know that human progress and\r\nknowledge are a river that has flowed ceaselessly\r\nsince the dawn of history. Every civilization has\r\nbeen both a beneficiary and a tributary of the\r\nachievements of other cultures. The Arab Islamic,\r\nChristian and pharaonic civilizations have all\r\nmade contributions that remain with us to this\r\nvery day. Without those contributions, the world\r\nwould not have been able to reach its current\r\nlevel of progress. Had it not been for those\r\ncontributions, the backward forces of darkness\r\nwould never have been reined in.\r\n“I stand before this Assembly at the end of\r\nthe first year of the third millennium, fully 10\r\nyears after the Madrid Conference which\r\nreaffirmed the basis for a settlement in the Middle\r\nEast, and yet the Arab-Israeli conflict and the\r\nquestion of Palestine at its core still await a just\r\nand comprehensive settlement. That is truly hard\r\nto believe.\r\n“It is most regrettable that the Syrian and\r\nPalestinian territories occupied in 1967 and parts\r\nof the territory of Lebanon continue to languish\r\nunder the heavy yoke of Israeli occupation. That\r\noccupation continues to give rise to injustice,\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\ndestruction, frustration and anger. Israel continues\r\nto refuse to comply with the terms of\r\ninternational legitimacy. It continues to defy the\r\nwill of the world. This unjust situation takes us\r\ndirectly back to the dark ages which the United\r\nNations was established to end, and creates\r\nsuffering and agony for a people whose only\r\ncrime is to demand their rights. It also creates an\r\nunhealthy climate exploited by those who wish to\r\nfish in troubled waters in order to propagate\r\ndarkness, misery, chaos and pain.\r\n“The international and regional situations,\r\nin addition to the humanitarian and legal\r\nrequirements and interests of all peoples, can no\r\nlonger tolerate the continued occupation,\r\nusurpation and settlement by Israel of the\r\nterritories of others. They can no longer brook an\r\narmy of hateful occupation using the most\r\nsophisticated and lethal weapons to brutalize\r\nunarmed civilians, demolish their homes and\r\nuproot their trees. All these actions are\r\nundertaken under a false pretext that disguises the\r\nfact that this army is only defending the\r\noccupation of the land of another people — the\r\npeople of Palestine.\r\n“Similarly, the international situation can no\r\nlonger bear the declaration by an occupying\r\nPower that it will not return the land it has seized\r\nand that, if it should return any, it will do so\r\nunder unfair conditions. Equally untenable is its\r\nposition that peace can only mean its hegemony\r\nand control in one form or another. The\r\nannouncement by a Government of its official\r\ndecision to resort to a policy of targeted killings\r\nis also unacceptable.\r\n“Like all nations and peoples, Israel must\r\nunderstand that the world has changed. It must\r\nrealize that it is in its own interest to comply with\r\nthe international will. The only guarantee for the\r\nsecurity of Israel and of the whole region is for\r\nIsrael to put an end to its occupation, policies and\r\npractices and to coexist with the peoples of the\r\nregion on the basis of equality, understanding and\r\nrespect for international legality and the\r\nresolutions of the United Nations. Security cannot\r\nbe achieved with continued occupation. Peace is\r\nincompatible with the doctrines of hegemony and\r\nsuperiority. Free cooperation alone can ensure\r\nprosperity for all.\r\n“Sometimes I feel that, while the Arabs\r\nhave accepted Israel’s existence among them,\r\nIsrael has not yet accepted the existence of a\r\nPalestinian people in the land of their ancestors,\r\nwith the right to live in a sovereign, independent\r\nState with Arab Jerusalem as its capital. No Arab,\r\nMuslim or Christian can abandon their holy sites\r\nin Jerusalem. Those sites are constantly\r\nthreatened by attempts to desecrate or destroy\r\nthem by Israeli extremists, with the support of\r\nthose ostensibly less extreme.\r\n“A political settlement of the question of\r\nPalestine, the core of the Arab-Israeli conflict,\r\nrequires the following.\r\n“First, Israel must demonstrate its clear will\r\nto abandon its continued occupation of Arab\r\nlands as an alleged means to maintain its security.\r\nIsrael needs to understand that its position in the\r\nMiddle East will not improve in any real sense\r\nuntil it evinces the resolve to return to the borders\r\nof 4 June 1967.\r\n“Secondly, Israel must realize that any\r\npeaceful settlement of the question of Palestine\r\nrequires the return of East Jerusalem to\r\nPalestinian sovereignty. Failure to understand this\r\nfact will always be an obstacle to all peaceful\r\nefforts to establish peace in the Middle East.\r\n“Thirdly, any political or security\r\narrangements for the settlement of the Palestinian\r\nquestion must lead to the establishment of a\r\nviable Palestinian State exercising sovereignty\r\nover its land, water and airspace. There must be a\r\njust settlement, based on United Nations\r\nresolutions and the norms of justice and\r\nlegitimacy, of the oldest refugee problem in\r\nmodern history, namely, that of Palestinian\r\nrefugees.\r\n“Fourthly, Egypt does not accept a situation\r\nin which Israel remains the sole nuclear Power in\r\nthe Middle East. The Middle East must be a zone\r\nfree from weapons of mass destruction. The\r\ncountries of the world, particularly the five\r\nnuclear-weapon States, must shoulder their\r\nresponsibilities under international nuclear non-\r\nproliferation instruments.\r\n“When such conditions prevail and are\r\nsupported forcefully and decisively by the\r\n40\r\nA/56/PV.52\r\nworld’s nations — including the friends of\r\nIsrael — because they are just and right, then the\r\npainful chapters of this long-lasting conflict can\r\nfinally be closed. Only then will it be possible to\r\nraise new generations living in peace and\r\ntolerance instead of living in the frustration,\r\nviolence and hatred that are born of illegal, unjust\r\noccupation.\r\n“I cannot fail to refer to the central and\r\nimportant role of the United States of America in\r\nassisting the parties to reach a final and just\r\nsettlement. Egypt looks with satisfaction to the\r\nresumption of the active role of the United States.\r\nIn this regard, Egypt also welcomes the role of\r\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and\r\nthe indispensable role of the United Nations in\r\nthe establishment of a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peace in our region. Egypt will\r\ncontinue to play its role in support of the\r\nbrotherly Palestinian people and on the side of\r\njustice, right and legitimacy.\r\n“Our part of the world, located in the area\r\nfrom West Asia to the southern shores of the\r\nMediterranean, requires peace in order to achieve\r\nthe objective of social, economic and political\r\ndevelopment. To that end, a just settlement must\r\nbe achieved quickly. Undoubtedly, the whole\r\ninternational community will support such a\r\nsettlement, which will also require the\r\npresentation of a major and integrated economic\r\nprogramme that would provide the economic\r\ncapabilities for unleashing the creative potential\r\nof the region, opening the door to constructive\r\ncooperation among all its peoples and nations,\r\nand helping it to overcome the tragedies it has\r\nlived through for more than a century.\r\n“Perhaps time does not allow us to address\r\nall the problems facing the world. Suffice it for\r\nme to reaffirm that Egypt will always eagerly\r\ncontinue its efforts to uphold the noble principles\r\nthat the Charter of this great Organization\r\nenshrines in a manner that serves the purposes\r\nand principles of all peoples. We assure the\r\nAssembly that we will continue our effective\r\nparticipation and enhance our active contribution\r\nto any collective action that guarantees to the\r\nUnited Nations the capacities and tools it needs to\r\nenable it to undertake the great responsibilities\r\nwith which we the Member States have charged\r\nit, as well as to confront the multiple challenges\r\nimposed by the changing nature of our world.”\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n"
