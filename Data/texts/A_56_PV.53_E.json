(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Manasseh\r\nSogavare, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands.\r\nThe Honourable Manasseh Sogavare, Prime\r\nMinister of Solomon Islands, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Manasseh\r\nSogavare, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, and\r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sogavare (Solomon Islands): At the outset,\r\nlet me express my sincere felicitations and those of my\r\nGovernment and the people of the Solomon Islands, on\r\nyour election, Sir, as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. As you know, the\r\nRepublic of Korea and Solomon Islands enjoy very\r\nwarm and cordial relations. My delegation is therefore\r\ndelighted to see you presiding over this Assembly. Our\r\ngratitude also goes to your predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, for the efficient manner in which he conducted\r\nthe work of the previous session. I also congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his well-\r\ndeserved reappointment for another term in office, and\r\non the award, to him and to the United Nations, of the\r\n2001 Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThe horrendous terrorist attack on the United\r\nStates on 11 September was an attack against humanity.\r\nWhat we witnessed on that day was unimaginable. It\r\nbrought pain and loss on an inconceivable scale; there\r\ncan be no justification for it. This morning I visited\r\nground zero to pay my respects to the thousands of\r\ninnocent people buried there and to reaffirm the\r\nsolidarity of Solomon Islands with the Government and\r\nthe people of the United States of America.\r\nTerrorism is an evil phenomenon which must be\r\neradicated. Individuals and organizations perpetrating\r\nsuch evil must be brought to justice. Similarly, States\r\nthat harbour or provide safe haven for terrorist\r\nactivities must play their full part in eradicating this\r\nmenace.\r\nThe war against international terrorism must aim\r\nto have far-reaching solutions, rather than be merely\r\nreactive. Effective international cooperation is critical\r\nto the global implementation of anti-terrorism\r\nmeasures, in order to deny terrorists any weak spots\r\nthat they could exploit to launch their criminal\r\noperations. Solomon Islands is taking steps towards the\r\nratification of the various international conventions\r\nagainst terrorism. Countries such as mine need\r\ntechnical support in law enforcement, surveillance and\r\ninformation-sharing so as to effectively implement\r\nthese instruments. In this regard, I welcome President\r\nBush’s offer to help countries that need assistance in\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nstrengthening and implementing anti-terrorism\r\nstrategies.\r\nWhile the war against terrorism is a matter of\r\nurgency, the United Nations should not underestimate\r\nthe continuing need to address other global issues that\r\nalso threaten human security. Persistent poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment; environmental degradation; internal\r\nconflict and war; the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, as well as of small arms and light\r\nweapons; trade in illicit drugs; the deadly spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS; and violations of human rights are all\r\ncomplex global problems that continue to demand\r\nconcerted global responses.\r\nWith their limited resources and capacity, small\r\nisland developing States like Solomon Islands are\r\nunable to cope with the magnitude of these problems.\r\nPost-cold-war security now rightly embraces human,\r\nenvironmental, economic and political dimensions.\r\nThe inter-ethnic crisis that the Solomon Islands\r\nexperienced between 1998 and 2000, and its\r\ndevastating impact on the country, is a sobering\r\nreminder that peace and development are intrinsically\r\nlinked. One cannot be achieved if the other fails. In\r\nmost situations, including in our case, peace takes\r\nprecedence, as no rebuilding is possible without\r\nsecurity and stability. My Government has worked\r\nresolutely to bring the warring factions to the table.\r\nOur efforts culminated in the signing of the Townsville\r\nPeace Agreement in October 2000 and of the Marau\r\nPeace Agreement earlier this year.\r\nThe Townsville Agreement led to the cessation of\r\nthe conflict. However, progress in the implementation\r\nof the Agreement’s disarmament provisions has been\r\nslow. With a considerable number of high-powered\r\nweapons still to be handed in, the peace process\r\nremains fragile. A review of the Agreement was begun\r\nrecently, but it has been temporarily suspended. We are\r\nconfident that the review process will soon resume in\r\norder to positively consolidate the ongoing peace\r\nprocess.\r\nMr. Ileka (Democratic Republic of the Congo),\r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nAt this juncture, I wish to acknowledge the\r\ncontributions of our development partners towards the\r\npeace process, in particular the Governments of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand\r\nand the countries of the European Union. My\r\nGovernment is also grateful to civil society institutions,\r\nincluding the churches and non-governmental\r\norganizations, for their efforts, especially at the height\r\nof the crisis.\r\nThe challenge is far from over. With a shattered\r\neconomy and a delicate peace process, the task of\r\nrebuilding the country and ensuring lasting peace is\r\nformidable. It requires the patience, cooperation and\r\ncommitment of all Solomon Islanders. My Government\r\nhas adopted a National Peace Plan and Programme of\r\nAction aimed at addressing the root causes of the\r\nconflict through meaningful dialogue and discussion\r\nand by encouraging a more participatory approach in\r\nthe country’s socio-economic and political\r\ndevelopment. The recent ruling by our judiciary\r\naffirming the constitutional legitimacy of my\r\nGovernment has given us additional resolve to\r\nimplement this Plan and Programme of Action. In this\r\nconnection, the understanding and support of the\r\ninternational community, in particular our development\r\npartners, is important.\r\nDevelopment cooperation should strive to reduce\r\nthe vulnerability of societies to violent conflicts. Aid\r\nshould go beyond immediate humanitarian needs. It has\r\nto be linked to peace-building initiatives in order to\r\nmake peace sustainable. Development assistance could,\r\ntherefore, be a means of conflict prevention and an\r\ninstrument for peace-building.\r\nThere is a clear imperative to address the poverty\r\nand inequality that exist among our countries. But there\r\nis also an irrefutable common interest for doing so, as\r\nmany of today’s problems — especially in the least\r\ndeveloped countries — are rooted in underdevelopment\r\nand poverty. The timely implementation of the\r\noutcomes of the Third United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Least Developed Countries is therefore imperative.\r\nWe are fully aware that primary responsibility to put in\r\nplace the necessary reforms for poverty reduction and\r\neconomic growth lies with the least developed\r\ncountries. Education, infrastructure development and\r\nimproving basic health services remain priority issues\r\nfor Solomon Islands.\r\nUndoubtedly, investment of overseas\r\ndevelopment assistance resources to support our efforts\r\ncan accelerate development. Donor countries and\r\nagencies must be more inclined to ensure that they do\r\nnot give with one hand, only to take away with the\r\nother. In a globalizing world, donor partners’ policies\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nin virtually every sector — including trade and\r\ninvestment, financial systems and the environment —\r\nmust help promote development for the poorest. In the\r\nabsence of that, the goal of attaining sustainable\r\ndevelopment and managing globalization in a way that\r\nmaximizes its benefits for all will be difficult to\r\nrealize.\r\nIn the same spirit, I call on the development\r\npartners to consider more practical and realistic\r\nmeasures to deal with the huge amount of debt burden\r\nthat poor countries continue to shoulder. Development\r\npartners must continue to positively consider measures\r\nsuch as writing off debts; for even the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative and the Paris Club\r\ninitiatives to address the problems of highly indebted\r\nand poor developing countries have been cumbersome\r\nand slow.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, which is to be held in Mexico next\r\nMarch, offers a unique opportunity for achieving\r\nconsensus on how to mobilize new and additional\r\nresources for development. Solomon Islands looks\r\nforward to participating actively in the Conference.\r\nAgenda 21 remains a valid blueprint for the\r\nmanagement of the Earth’s environment and the\r\nsustainable development of its resources. The World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\r\nJohannesburg next year, 10 years after Rio, should\r\nreach consensus on ways and means to ensure wider\r\nand effective implementation of Agenda 21 and\r\nsubsequent international programmes, including the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\r\nThe ocean and its bounty continue to be a\r\nprincipal resource for Solomon Islands. Our priorities\r\nconcerning oceans include sustainable fisheries\r\nmanagement, habitat protection and avoidance of\r\nmarine pollution. For us, the success of national\r\ndevelopment planning depends significantly on the\r\ncontinued health of the marine environment.\r\nThe unique circumstances of small island\r\ndeveloping States must be fully understood by the\r\ninternational community as we strive to address the\r\nserious threats of natural disasters, climate change and\r\nsea-level rise. The Kyoto Protocol remains a significant\r\nfirst step on the path to ensuring effective global action\r\nto combat climate change. The international\r\ncommunity must now build on the outcomes of the\r\nseventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the\r\nFramework Convention and work further towards the\r\nresolution of all outstanding negotiating issues.\r\nWe must recall the vision which the United\r\nNations was created to serve, i.e. that each and every\r\nhuman being deserves to live in dignity, be well\r\nnourished, be educated, have access to decent health\r\ncare and decent work, be respected and consulted, and\r\nbe able to develop their talents and creativity. Our\r\nchallenge is to strengthen the United Nations and other\r\ninternational institutions to strive more effectively\r\ntowards that vision. Solomon Islands remains\r\ncommitted to the reform initiatives of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThis session should also continue with efforts to\r\nmake the work of the General Assembly more efficient\r\nand effective. Furthermore, discussions on the reform\r\nof the Security Council have gone on for too long\r\nwithout substantial progress. Greater flexibility is\r\nrequired in order for this process to be completed. The\r\ngoal is to have a more democratic, transparent and\r\neffective Security Council.\r\nIn what is surely one of the bitter ironies of our\r\ntimes, free and democratic Taiwan, home to 23 million\r\npeople and a peace-loving country, has been excluded\r\nnot only from the United Nations and all its specialized\r\nagencies but also from nearly every other\r\nintergovernmental organization in the world. Although\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan willingly abides by\r\ninternational norms, standards and obligations, it is not\r\nable to enjoy the same normal standard privileges and\r\ntreatment accorded to others. This is simply unfair and\r\nunjust. The time has come to reconsider the exclusion\r\nof the Republic of China from the United Nations. The\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan was a founding member\r\nof the Organization. It is a model of economic success\r\nand democratic politics. Taiwan has continued to share\r\nits development experiences with the wider\r\ninternational community when given the opportunity.\r\nIts continuing assistance during humanitarian crises\r\nalso deserves full commendation.\r\nSolomon Islands’ appeal for Taiwan’s\r\nrepresentation and participation in the United Nations\r\nsystem is premised on the principles of justice, dignity\r\nand the right of the people of Taiwan to be heard and\r\nrepresented in the international arena and for them to\r\nbe able to enjoy the same benefits that the rest of us\r\nenjoy. My Government firmly believes that Taiwan’s\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nmembership in the United Nations will effectively\r\nserve to facilitate peaceful dialogue between the two\r\nChinas and provide a solid basis for a lasting\r\nreconciliation between them. Dialogue is the only\r\nmeans to resolve differences, and parity and mutual\r\nrespect must be the foundation upon which both sides\r\ncan build trust and confidence. The United Nations is\r\nthe best forum to nurture that trust and confidence. The\r\nissue of Taiwan’s membership is consistent with the\r\nUnited Nations principle of universality. But, above all,\r\nit must be acknowledged that the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan is fully committed to fulfilling the obligations\r\nof the United Nations Charter.\r\nFinally, next month my country is going to the\r\npolls to elect a new parliament, and thereafter a new\r\nGovernment will be formed. This election manifests\r\nour continuing commitment to constitutional and\r\nparliamentary democracy. It is a critical election, as it\r\nwill confer a new mandate for the next Government to\r\ncontinue with the ever-important responsibilities of\r\nensuring the rule of law, rebuilding the economy and\r\nfurther consolidating the current peace process.\r\nThose are difficult tasks, but we are determined\r\nto write a new page in our young history — a new page\r\nthat should provide for ethnic harmony and co-\r\nexistence, comprehensive and lasting peace, economic\r\nprosperity, and, above all, engender and nurture a\r\nbetter future and hope for our children and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of\r\nSolomon Islands for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of\r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Osmonakun Ibraimov, State\r\nSecretary of the Kyrgyz Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the State Secretary of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Osmonakun Ibraimov, State Secretary of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Osmonakun Ibraimov,\r\nState Secretary of the Kyrgyz Republic, and inviting\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Ibraimov (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): I\r\nwould like at the outset to join in all the\r\ncongratulations that have been extended to the\r\nPresident on his election as President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I would like to assure\r\nhim that our delegation is ready to cooperate fully with\r\nhim and also to wish him, on behalf of the Kyrgyz\r\ndelegation, success in carrying out his duties.\r\nOur delegation would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his re-election to a second term of\r\noffice and also on his winning the Nobel Peace Prize,\r\ntogether with the United Nations, this year. We\r\nconsider that this award was well deserved.\r\nThe work of this session is taking place at an\r\nextremely complex time for the international\r\ncommunity. Today, from this lofty rostrum, on behalf\r\nof the people of Kyrgyzstan, I convey our deepest\r\ncondolences to the people and the Government of the\r\nUnited States in connection with the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember this year, which claimed many victims.\r\nTerrorism has laid down an extremely dangerous\r\nchallenge to all of civilized humanity, democracy and\r\nfreedom. In this context, the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity aimed at combating terrorism, first and\r\nforemost within the framework of the United Nations,\r\nare fully supported by Kyrgyzstan, and our\r\nGovernment is taking all necessary measures to\r\nimplement Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001)\r\nand 1373 (2001). From the very outset, we have\r\nsupported and will continue to support the activities of\r\nthe United States and other countries within the anti-\r\nterrorist coalition, and consider the military operations\r\nto be inevitable and justified actions.\r\nOur position of principle with respect to terrorism\r\nstems from Kyrgyzstan’s position at the epicentre of\r\nthe struggle against international terrorism and against\r\nthe illegal trafficking in drugs and weapons, which are\r\na threat to the stability and security not only of the\r\nCentral Asian region but of the entire civilized world.\r\nOur country has for three years been defending itself\r\nagainst incursions by terrorist bands that have resulted\r\nin the deaths of entirely innocent people. If it had not\r\nbeen for our firm determination to take a stand against\r\nterrorism and keep a firm lock on our borders, then\r\nserious destabilization of the entire region would have\r\nbeen inevitable. We do not wish to exaggerate our role,\r\nbut it is we who have prevented the terrorists from\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\ncrossing our borders into other countries. I would also\r\nlike to note that Kyrgyzstan has also made its territory\r\navailable and the necessary transport vehicles for the\r\ntransit of international humanitarian assistance to\r\nAfghanistan on the Osh-Ishkashim-Faizabad road.\r\nA serious problem for us is that of refugees who\r\nhave come to the territory of our Republic from the\r\nregion of the conflict. Kyrgyzstan already hosts\r\napproximately 2,000 Afghan refugees. Their numbers\r\ncould increase very rapidly. All of this is a very serious\r\nproblem, and finding a solution will require active\r\nassistance from the relevant international\r\norganizations.\r\nOver the last few years we have all seen\r\nAfghanistan become a sanctuary for various\r\ninternational terrorist organizations. After the fall of\r\nKabul yesterday, the inter-Afghan conflict has entered\r\na completely new phase. Moreover, it is now more\r\nurgent than ever to deal with the question of a mutually\r\nacceptable solution to untie the Afghan knot.\r\nKyrgyzstan proceeds from a deep understanding of the\r\nneed for rapidly winding up the military confrontation\r\nin Afghanistan, with the subsequent formation in that\r\nlong-suffering country of a broadly representative,\r\nmulti-ethnic Government, that, first and foremost,\r\nmeets the interests and aspirations of the Afghan\r\npeople.\r\nIn this connection, Kyrgyzstan welcomes\r\nconstructive ideas and proposals aimed at establishing\r\na long-awaited peace in Afghanistan. For our part, we\r\nconsistently express our readiness to cooperate with all\r\nthe countries involved in order to settle the Afghan\r\nconflict. We consider that it is precisely the United\r\nNations, with its experience, capabilities and\r\ninstitutional potential, that should play a key role in\r\nbringing together the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism. In this regard,\r\nKyrgyzstan proposes the creation of a special\r\ncommittee of the United Nations to restore peace and\r\nstability in Afghanistan, which could be a coordinating\r\nbody for all the practical measures to this end.\r\nToday we would like to recall one of the well-\r\nknown initiatives of the President of Kyrgyzstan, Askar\r\nAkayev, to hold a forum for dialogue on security\r\nquestions between the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference. It seems to us that there is now\r\nan urgent need for such a dialogue between these two\r\nauthoritative organizations. In this connection,\r\nKyrgyzstan took the very important initiative to hold\r\non 13-14 December of this year, under the aegis of the\r\nOSCE in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, an\r\ninternational conference on enhancing security and\r\nstability in Central Asia and strengthening\r\ncomprehensive efforts to counter terrorism. We are\r\nnow making active preparations, together with the\r\nsecretariat of the OSCE, for this important measure. In\r\nour view, the participation of the United Nations in that\r\nevent would facilitate a consolidated solution for\r\nworking out joint approaches to combating terrorism.\r\nThis would be an important step in strengthening the\r\ninternational community’s capacity to avert the threat\r\nto security in Central Asia, including by expanding the\r\nassistance to countries in that region in the face of the\r\ngrowing threat. It is encouraging to note that many\r\nStates, including participants in the anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition, are showing serious interest in the Bishkek\r\ninternational conference to combat terrorism.\r\nKyrgyzstan attaches great importance to\r\nquestions of sustainable development. In this regard,\r\nmy delegation greatly appreciates the decision of the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly to hold a\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa. It is a pleasure to note that\r\nKyrgyzstan made a very significant contribution to the\r\npreparation of the Rio + 10 summit on problems of\r\nsustainable development, having organized, together\r\nwith the United Nations Secretariat, in Bishkek, a\r\nregional round table. The results of the round table will\r\ncertainly be reflected in the key documents of the\r\nWorld Summit in Johannesburg.\r\nAs we well know, the United Nations has\r\nproclaimed next year the International Year of\r\nMountains. This is certainly a very important and\r\nproductive initiative on a global level. We, the\r\nmembers of the delegation of Kyrgyz Republic, can\r\nindeed be proud that one of the most important\r\ninitiatives of the International Year of Mountains was\r\ntaken by our President, Askar Akayev.\r\nIt is indeed true that the mountains of the world\r\nare a symbol of the lofty ideals of humankind, but\r\nmountains also pose related ecological, economic and\r\nsocial problems for the people living in those areas.\r\nHigh mountains should not cause these problems for\r\ntheir inhabitants. I fully agree fully with Mrs. Benita\r\nFerrero-Waldner, the Foreign Minister of Austria, that\r\nthe International Year of Mountains should be a year\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nfor new initiatives for exchanging experience and\r\ndrafting new programmes of cooperation.\r\nThe acuity of the ecological problems of\r\nmountainous areas and their connection to economic\r\nproblems led our specialists to examine international\r\nexperience in order to see how to restructure our debts\r\nby seeking debt-relief in exchange for ecological\r\ninitiatives. We feel that this approach provides a unique\r\nopportunity for financing national ecological and\r\nenvironmental projects and economic investment\r\nprogrammes. We should also like to express the hope\r\nthat at the upcoming International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in Mexico, sufficient\r\nattention will be given to the specific problems of\r\nmountainous countries.\r\nWe wish to take this opportunity to welcome the\r\ndecision of Member States to hold an official opening\r\nceremony for the International Year of Mountains in\r\nNew York in December of next year. We also note with\r\ngreat satisfaction that in October 2002, the capital of\r\nKyrgyzstan, Bishkek, will welcome representatives\r\nfrom all over the world for the Bishkek Global\r\nMountain Summit. We are already preparing for this\r\nvery important event, which will take place during the\r\nInternational Year of Mountains. We wish to express\r\nour hope that the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, Mr. Kofi Annan, will be able participate in the\r\nSummit.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express our deep\r\nconviction that the efforts of United Nations Member\r\nStates and the entire world community are aimed at\r\nimplementing the ideals and principles enshrined in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the United Nations\r\nCharter, and that they will lead to the triumph of peace,\r\nfreedom and democracy.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the State Secretary of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Osmonakun Ibraimov, State Secretary of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Lieutenant-General.\r\nMompati S. Merafhe, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nBotswana.\r\nMr. Merafhe (Botswana): Before I deliver my\r\nstatement, please allow me to express the heartfelt\r\ncondolences of my delegation to the Governments of\r\nthe United States of America and the Dominican\r\nRepublic and to the families of the victims of the tragic\r\nair traffic accident in New York on Monday. During\r\nthis time of grief and sadness, our sympathies are with\r\nthose who lost their loved ones.\r\nIt is with great pleasure that I extend to the\r\nPresident and his country, the Republic of Korea, the\r\nwarmest congratulations of my delegation on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We are\r\nconfident that under his able leadership, we will have a\r\nvery productive session. The President can rest assured\r\nof the full cooperation of the delegation of Botswana in\r\nthe discharge of the noble task entrusted to him.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. The skilful\r\nmanner in which he guided our deliberations during the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly speaks for\r\nhis wealth of diplomatic experience and diligence in\r\nhis work.\r\nTo our Secretary-General, may I express the full\r\nsupport and confidence of my delegation as he begins a\r\nsecond term of office. We congratulate him for the\r\nhighly esteemed Nobel Peace Prize for 2001, bestowed\r\njointly on him and the United Nations system. This\r\nspecial award is not only to the Secretary-General,\r\npersonally, but also to the many dedicated men and\r\nwomen who continue to work tirelessly for the United\r\nNations system.\r\nIt is regrettable that even as we are assembled\r\nhere to forge a common future within the same walls\r\nwhere just 12 months ago our leaders proclaimed the\r\narrival of a brave new world full of hope and promise,\r\nour attention should be drawn to acts of international\r\nterrorism not far from where we are meeting.\r\nMy delegation wishes to add its voice to those of\r\nother speakers who have condemned, in the strongest\r\nlanguage possible, the bombings that occurred in New\r\nYork and Washington, resulting in a huge loss of\r\nhuman life. Immediately after learning of these attacks,\r\nmy Government issued a statement in which we\r\ncondemned these terrorist attacks and those who\r\nconceived and perpetrated them. A unified and\r\nconcerted effort is required from the international\r\ncommunity in order to wipe the scourge of\r\ninternational terrorism from the face of the earth, once\r\nand for all.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nAmong other things, we need to reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the full implementation of all\r\nconventions on combating terrorism. My delegation is\r\nconvinced that the international community\r\ncollectively has the resources necessary to win the war\r\nagainst terrorism. This is a challenge of our age.\r\nThe other major challenge that presents\r\nextraordinary danger to humanity is the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, whose devastating impact on our societies\r\nand our economies, particularly in Africa, is well\r\ndocumented.\r\nAccording to recent estimates, of the 36.1 million\r\npeople living with HIV globally, 25.3 million are in\r\nsub-Saharan Africa. Of the 5.3 million people infected\r\nwith the virus during 2000, 3.8 million were in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. Of the 3.0 million people who died of\r\nHIV/AIDS in 2000, 2.4 million were in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. These statistics present an extremely grim\r\npicture of the HIV/AIDS situation in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. As delegates are no doubt aware, my country is\r\none of the worst affected on the continent. Unless we\r\njoin forces to tackle this pandemic, it will continue to\r\nhave a devastating impact on our societies and\r\neconomies. Funding for the HIV/AIDS programmes is\r\ngrossly inadequate and has to be increased in order to\r\nmitigate the impact of the scourge.\r\nIndeed, the twenty-sixth special session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly underscored the\r\nimperative of intensified global action to combat the\r\npandemic. The Global HIV/AIDS and Health Fund\r\ncould not have come at a more opportune time. It is our\r\nsincere hope, therefore, that the donor community will\r\nrespond positively to the financing of the trust fund.\r\nI want to stress the need to strengthen the role of\r\nthe United Nations in this fight. Our efforts for the\r\nprevention and treatment of the disease need to be\r\naugmented and strengthened by concrete measures of\r\nsupport and resources from the international\r\ncommunity if we are to turn the tide of the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe third issue I wish to highlight is that of\r\n“conflict diamonds” versus “development diamonds”.\r\nBotswana deplores the fact that diamond resources in a\r\nnumber of countries in Africa are being plundered by\r\nrebels to purchase weapons that are used to cause\r\nenormous suffering to innocent people.\r\nHowever, I want to underscore the fact that\r\n“conflict diamonds” constitute only 4 per cent or less\r\nof the world trade in diamonds. Legitimate, conflict-\r\nfree diamonds, such as those produced in my country,\r\nare used to generate socio-economic growth and\r\ndevelopment. I am glad that the contribution of\r\nconflict-free diamonds to the economic growth of\r\ncountries such as mine, and indeed of other countries in\r\nSouthern Africa, is being appreciated.\r\nWe have been active participants in the Kimberly\r\nProcess, in which Governments of diamond-producing\r\ncountries of Southern Africa and other interested\r\nGovernments, the diamond industry and civil society\r\norganizations are working together to institute a\r\ncertification scheme designed to eliminate that small\r\npercentage of conflict diamonds from world trade. We\r\nsincerely want to see the suffering inflicted upon the\r\npeople of Angola, Sierra Leone, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Congo and others brought to an end.\r\nRegrettably, many more countries in our\r\ncontinent continue to be torn apart by war and conflict.\r\nWe applaud the efforts of the United Nations and other\r\ninternational players to enhance the capacity of African\r\ncountries to prevent conflict and maintain peace and\r\nstability in the continent. We are convinced that the\r\ndetermination of many in Africa to consolidate\r\ndemocracy will go a long way towards ensuring that\r\nconditions of security and stability are instituted\r\nthroughout the continent. The establishment of the\r\nAfrican Union, which will be launched next year in the\r\nRepublic of South Africa, is the most positive\r\nexpression of a new solidarity, based on an urgent\r\nsearch for collective economic security and political\r\npartnership. Without underestimating the hurdles we\r\nstill face as we move our continent towards integration,\r\nit is our fervent belief that an era of hope has been\r\nushered in on our continent.\r\nThe most talked about undertaking by Africa in\r\nrecent weeks has been the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which is aimed at achieving\r\nsocio-economic development by alleviating poverty as\r\nwell as promoting peace, security, democracy and good\r\ngovernance. Unlike other initiatives that came before\r\nit, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\nchallenges African countries to take primary\r\nresponsibility for their own development by ushering in\r\na political environment guaranteeing peace, security\r\nand stability, respect for human rights, democratic\r\nprinciples and the rule of law.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nThe initiative underscores the need for a policy\r\nframework and, indeed, regulatory structures that will\r\nenhance governance in Africa. I must say, all of these\r\nare achievable objectives, and we as a continent have\r\nunreservedly committed ourselves, our Governments\r\nand peoples, and the required resources to their\r\nattainment. We also believe that the initiative will\r\nusher in a new concept of technical cooperation\r\nbetween Africa and our development partners, and that\r\nthe United Nations will have a critical role to play in\r\nits implementation.\r\nMy delegation attaches importance to the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, scheduled to be held in Mexico in the\r\nspring of 2002, and the forthcoming World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, to be held in South Africa in\r\nSeptember 2002. These Conferences will offer us an\r\nopportunity to examine issues of development in a\r\nholistic and pragmatic manner. Issues of environment,\r\ntrade, domestic policy-making, international\r\ncooperation and partnership with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, as well as the private sector, will have to\r\nfeature prominently at these conferences.\r\nRecent developments in Sierra Leone give us\r\nhope that peace will now be given a chance in that\r\ncountry. The agreement between the Government\r\nand the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which will\r\nsee the latter transformed into a political party, is a\r\nmajor achievement and an important step forward. The\r\nRUF must now translate its promises into action,\r\nbecause this is the only way that the international\r\ncommunity will be able to provide the much needed\r\nsupport for the holding of the envisaged national\r\nelections, which will provide the basis for the\r\nrestoration of peace and stability in Sierra Leone.\r\nThere is a real window of opportunity for peace\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After many\r\nyears of bloody conflict, which has inflicted immense\r\nsuffering on the people of the Congo, the political\r\nplayers and other stakeholders have embarked on a\r\nnational dialogue that should bring peace to the\r\ncountry. I would like to underline the fact that\r\ndedication and perseverance will be required on the\r\npart of those concerned in order for the inter-Congolese\r\ndialogue to be crowned with success. We therefore urge\r\nthe players to see the process of negotiations through,\r\nbecause the alternative is to slide back down into the\r\nsuffering and misery that the Congolese have endured\r\nfor so long. I also wish to call upon the international\r\ncommunity to provide the necessary support and\r\nresources to the Office of the Facilitator, former\r\nPresident Sir Ketumile Masire, to enable the\r\nfacilitation process of the inter-Congolese dialogue to\r\nsucceed.\r\nThe peace process in Burundi is moving in the\r\nright direction after many years of painful war. The\r\ndeal brokered by former President Mandela has\r\nprovided a way out of the stalemate. The resolve of the\r\nparties to remain committed to the peace process is the\r\nonly way forward.\r\nWe continue to be concerned that prospects for\r\npeace in Angola remain distant. At the heart of the\r\nimpasse are UNITA’s continuing acts of destabilization\r\nand sabotage. UNITA must understand that there can\r\nbe no military solution to the crisis in Angola. We\r\ntherefore wish to appeal to UNITA to reconsider its\r\nposition and choose the path of dialogue.\r\nMy delegation is seriously concerned at the\r\nrecent escalation of violence in the Middle East. It is\r\nour sincere hope that the Government of Israel and the\r\nPalestinian Authority will recognize the urgent need to\r\nresume negotiations towards a comprehensive peace\r\nagreement. A lasting solution to this problem is\r\nessential.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm my country’s\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. We are committed to working\r\nwith others to strengthen this Organization in order to\r\nsurmount the challenges that face us all as nations and\r\npeoples across the globe. The United Nations is our\r\nonly hope for a stable and prosperous world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vartan Oskanian, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Armenia.\r\nMr. Oskanian (Armenia): Let me begin, Sir, by\r\ncongratulating President Han Seung-soo on his election\r\nas President of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I would like also to express our appreciation\r\nof and respect for Mr. Harri Holkeri for the\r\nprofessionalism and dedication with which he\r\nconducted the previous session.\r\nSince the acts of terrorism on 11 September, each\r\nof us, as individuals and as leaders responsible for the\r\nfuture of our planet, has been trying to understand what\r\nhappened — why and how. The universal\r\ncondemnation of the arrogance and fascist mentality\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nthat conceives and implements such terror could not\r\nhave been more justified. The immediate determination\r\nthat the perpetrators must be punished and their bases\r\neliminated was necessary and prudent. The awareness\r\nthat this is a long and complex process remains\r\nevident.\r\nScholars and analysts have attempted to explore\r\nand explain that day of terror, its causes and its\r\nramifications. This is a necessary process that, if we\r\nare patient, will begin with more questions than\r\nanswers. Listening will inevitably lead to dialogue, not\r\njust this year, but every year. If we are honest, this\r\ndialogue will reflect the fact that, although we all see\r\nquite plainly that there has been a change, we do not\r\nagree on what that change is or how it affects each of\r\nus.\r\nThere are those who believe that the world has\r\nbeen taken off the path of economic globalization and\r\ndemocratization. There are some who insist that the\r\nnature and course of international relations has\r\nirrevocably changed — that the world order, as it\r\nexisted, has come crashing down. That may be the\r\ninescapable, though illusory, initial reaction. It may\r\nappear that bilateral and multilateral relations have\r\nbeen fundamentally and involuntarily re-tailored.\r\nYet if this perception becomes more than a\r\nnatural temporary reaction — if the terrorists succeed\r\nin intimidating us, and force us to take actions that are\r\nnot in our best interests, causing us to abandon\r\nprinciples and agendas — then the terrorists will have\r\nsucceeded. They will have terrorized their way to\r\nsetting agendas and determining policies. But just as\r\nNew Yorkers have vowed continued allegiance to their\r\ncity and their way of life, the international community,\r\ntoo, must remain true to its structures, traditions and\r\nagenda.\r\nThat is not to say, however, that life has returned\r\nto business as usual, or that it can do so. It certainly\r\ncannot return to thinking as usual. Our allied approach\r\nto the problems and realities that we collectively face\r\nrequires genuine, radical rethinking. The deep\r\ndissatisfaction, injustice, poverty and hopelessness —\r\nwhich do not justify terror but serve to validate it,\r\nlegitimize it and guard it — must be addressed and\r\neradicated, too. These deep-problems must be replaced\r\nby equality, education, social justice, women’s and\r\nchildren’s human rights, civil liberties and democracy.\r\nArmenia readily joined the global struggle to\r\neradicate the terrorism network because the success of\r\nthis effort is as important for us as it is for the coalition\r\nleaders. However, Armenia asks that, in our effort and\r\nexercise of responsibility, to neutralize this enemy, we\r\nbe careful about our own definitions and labels. Just as\r\nit is crucial to ensure solidarity in the united battle\r\nagainst the evil of terrorism, a divergence of\r\ninterpretative opinion or varied agendas should not be\r\nconstrued as lack of solidarity.\r\nJust as the coalition leaders are concerned about\r\nthe effects of terrorism on their countries, peoples,\r\nlifestyles and values, Armenia is concerned about how\r\nthe advent of such terror, and the extended battle\r\nagainst it, will affect our region and our country. The\r\nwar on terrorism has added a further dimension to our\r\ndomestic and foreign policy agenda, not narrowed its\r\nfocus. The economic and political conditions which\r\nmake ours a volatile region have not gone away.\r\nIndeed, they have been exacerbated by the new\r\nalliances and priorities. Worse still, they might be\r\nfurther aggravated if they are ignored and allowed to\r\nlie latent while all attention is focused on the\r\nimmediate danger. In focusing on the hatred of\r\nthousands, we do not want to dismiss the frustration\r\nand needs of millions, many of whom stand at the brink\r\nof war.\r\nThat is why, even as Armenia has offered\r\nunreserved cooperation with the global coalition,\r\nsigned the United Nations and Council of Europe anti-\r\nterrorism conventions, and offered military and\r\nstrategic assistance, we continue to insist that the\r\nfundamental short- and long-term developmental issues\r\nfacing us also be dealt with. We are worried about the\r\nstability of our region, because the basic freedoms\r\nwhich are the hallmarks of modern society and which\r\ndecrease the likelihood of violent social and political\r\nsolutions are not universally guaranteed in our\r\nneighbourhood.\r\nSecurity and peace around the world depend on\r\nstability in each region. If we are committed to world\r\npeace and security, each of us in our own region must\r\ntake on the responsibility to address the outstanding\r\nissues in a new light, guided by new thinking. It\r\nremains for the leaders to abandon the expediency of\r\nrealpolitik for the efficacy of “justpolitik”. This is\r\nnothing that has not been said before, but perhaps in\r\nthis new environment of searching, our call will not fall\r\non deaf ears. Our region has the wealth, the traditions,\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nthe opportunities and the links that can make it flourish\r\nand thrive.\r\nAs far as Armenia’s contribution to peace and\r\nstability in the Caucasus is concerned, there are two\r\nintertwined issues affecting our relations with two of\r\nour neighbours. One is the absence of relations with\r\nTurkey, to the west; the other is the Nagorny Karabakh\r\nconflict, which affects our relations with Azerbaijan.\r\nFor the past 10 years, representatives of my\r\nGovernment have, from this podium, affirmed that\r\nbasic freedoms of thought, belief, conviction, ethics,\r\ntraditions, values and culture also apply to the men,\r\nwomen and children of Nagorny Karabakh. This lies at\r\nthe heart of the conflict over Nagorny Karabakh.\r\nAzerbaijan’s insistence on inventing numbers,\r\nredefining terms, creating history and obfuscating\r\ndiscussion are part of the problem, not the search for a\r\nsolution. In response to the charges made today by my\r\ncolleague from Azerbaijan with regard to Armenia and\r\nNagorny Karabakh, let me say the following. Nagorny\r\nKarabakh has never been a part of independent\r\nAzerbaijan. Whether we consider history or geography,\r\nwhether we adopt a long-term political perspective or\r\nface the reality of the facts on the ground, the men,\r\nwomen and children of Nagorny Karabakh have earned\r\nthe right to live peacefully on their historic lands. For\r\ndecades they have been denied that right. Today, a\r\ndozen years after the re-eruption of the conflict, the\r\nchildren of Karabakh have completed an entire school\r\ncareer free of alien domination and foreign occupation.\r\nJustice for the people of Nagorny Karabakh has\r\nbeen at the core of Armenia’s policies and actions, not\r\njust because we believe it is right, but also because we\r\nbelieve that, in order to achieve lasting peace,\r\neconomic cooperation and political development, this\r\nconflict will have to be resolved fairly and fully.\r\nAzerbaijan’s empty calls for a military solution, which\r\narise from an adherence to old clichés rather than from\r\nnew realities, are not acceptable among neighbours that\r\nare serious about peace.\r\nAs for our relations with Turkey, in this post-\r\n11 September world, when the cold war has truly and\r\nfinally ended, where erstwhile adversaries have found\r\nreasons to put aside ideology and establish\r\npartnerships, perhaps Turkey will put aside\r\npreconditions in the interests of regional and world\r\npeace. Armenia would like to have normal, good-\r\nneighbourly relations with Turkey, and is hopeful that\r\nTurkey will establish diplomatic relations with\r\nArmenia, open the borders and engage in constructive\r\ncooperation.\r\nBut the obvious must be stated. The memory of\r\nthe Armenian genocide continues to haunt and obstruct\r\nTurkey’s relations with Armenia. However, we are\r\nconfident that this issue can be addressed between the\r\ntwo Governments, through dialogue. The events of the\r\npast two months have reminded Armenians that man is\r\nindeed capable of immense, indescribable evil and that\r\nmass violence is not a thing of the past. Yet if we, as\r\nthe victims of genocide, are unwilling to permit our\r\nown tragic past to define our actions in the future, we\r\ncan confidently call on Turkey to do the same, and to\r\njoin us as equal participants in a dialogue between our\r\ntwo peoples.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations\r\nprovides the most overarching and inclusive framework\r\nfor creating the conditions that make States and\r\npeoples prefer peace to war. The United Nations —\r\nacting, where possible, with various multilateral and\r\nregional organizations — should identify and utilize\r\nthe comparative advantage and specificity of each\r\ninstitution and each country as a potential fighter, as a\r\npotential instrument in the war for peace, and even as a\r\npotential victim.\r\nThe United Nations did not need 11 September to\r\nacknowledge economic development and poverty\r\neradication as strategic battlefields in the war against\r\nterrorism. Donor countries can contribute to the\r\nsuccess of this war by providing not only military\r\nforces, but also greater financial and technical\r\nassistance.\r\nSuch assistance must be coordinated. The new\r\nchallenges call for the consolidation of existing\r\nmechanisms of international dialogue, cooperation and\r\nsecurity. The United Nations can make a major\r\ncontribution to this process, especially if it reflects, in a\r\nmore equitable manner, the political and economic\r\nrealities of today’s world. We believe that real reform\r\nof the Security Council lies in the expansion of both\r\ncategories: permanent and non-permanent. We support\r\nthe desire of Germany and Japan to become permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\nArmenia also attaches great significance to the\r\nissue of equitable geographic representation, and hence\r\nit supports increased representation for\r\nunderrepresented regions, especially Asia, Africa,\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. In this regard,\r\nArmenia is equally supportive of India’s quest for\r\npermanent membership in the Security Council. We\r\nbelieve strongly that any increase in non-permanent\r\nmembership should also ensure enhanced\r\nrepresentation for the Group of Eastern European\r\nStates through the allocation of one additional non-\r\npermanent seat.\r\nModern life has caused upheavals in static\r\nsocieties, and the answer lies not in any particular faith\r\nbut in healthy, democratic institutions and legislation\r\nand viable economic systems.\r\nWriter V. S. Naipaul made that assertion, and this\r\nyear he was awarded a Nobel Prize, as was Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan. This choice of recipients provides\r\nmuch food for thought. Neither has been exclusivist;\r\nthey have both been inclusive, as can be seen in their\r\nability to bring their deep-rooted traditions to bear on\r\nthe challenges facing our global society. While Naipaul\r\nthe writer teases and provokes, Annan the diplomat\r\nchallenges and soothes. They both do so with grace and\r\nfrom positions of strength. They can both afford to be\r\nmore extreme in their pronouncements, but they are\r\nnot.\r\nThe message here is that in this year of dialogue\r\namong civilizations, there are successful ways of\r\nmerging the best of the world’s traditions, even while\r\nchallenging the world to move forward towards justice\r\nand democracy for all. Naipaul and Annan do not reject\r\nthe failures of the world, but challenge us to address\r\nthem. We, collectively, could do worse than to follow\r\ntheir example.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call\r\non His Excellency Mr. Koffi Panou, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Republic of\r\nTogo.\r\nMr. Panou (Togo) (spoke in French): The sudden\r\nspeeding up of events that has taken place since the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly and their\r\npotential impact on the future of humankind only\r\nconfirms our impression that our world is experiencing\r\ndevelopments that could, one the one hand, open the\r\ndoor to hopes for peace, stability and progress, or, on\r\nthe other, jeopardize these hopes and imperil prospects\r\nfor a better world.\r\nThe threat is real. We therefore must mobilize our\r\nefforts to an even greater extent to ensure that the\r\nideals of peace, solidarity, justice and tolerance can\r\ntriumph throughout the world.\r\nHatred and intolerance took centre stage on 11\r\nSeptember, when the United States, our host country,\r\nwas the target of terrorist acts of indescribable and\r\nunjustifiable barbarity.\r\nIn the face of the outrage and horror to which\r\nthose events gave rise, the President of the Republic of\r\nTogo immediately condemned these heinous attacks,\r\nwhich he called a veritable declaration of war, and\r\nwhich, regrettably, caused the death of nationals of\r\nnearly 80 countries, including mine.\r\nOnce again, in paying tribute to all of those who\r\nlost their lives in the tragedy of 11 September and in\r\nconveying once again our deep condolences to the\r\nAmerican people, I should like to express the fervent\r\nhope that, thanks to our collective efforts and to a\r\ngreater solidarity in our actions, we will be able to\r\ndefeat evil.\r\nBecause we have on several occasions been the\r\nvictims of terrorist acts, Togo is aware of the\r\nsignificance and seriousness of the consequences of\r\nsuch acts of murderous violence, which are committed\r\nwith complete disregard for respect for human life and\r\nfor human dignity.\r\nThe joint combat against international terrorism,\r\nin all its manifestations and wherever necessary, is a\r\ntask of great importance for the entire international\r\ncommunity, because no one is safe from this scourge.\r\nThis fight should not be understood as a confrontation\r\nbetween civilizations, cultures or religions. Identifying\r\nthe true causes of this scourge and finding appropriate\r\nsolutions to combat it — this is the true challenge that\r\nwe must meet.\r\nIn this context, it is important to do everything\r\nwe can to ensure the broadest possible participation of\r\nStates in the strict application of the 12 international\r\nconventions dealing with specific aspects of terrorism\r\nand to step up negotiations on the comprehensive\r\nconvention on international terrorism.\r\nLikewise, it is essential for all States to cooperate\r\nclosely with the mechanism has been set up by the\r\nSecurity Council pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001) in\r\norder to combat this scourge in an efficient and\r\ncoordination manner. My country is already complying\r\nwith its responsibilities in the context of this process.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nHowever, cooperation in eradicating this scourge\r\nneeds to be strengthened at the regional level as well.\r\nThus our West African subregion notes with\r\nsatisfaction that it has set up functional structures to\r\ncombat terrorism, through the quadripartite agreement\r\nbetween Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria; and the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) Protocol on Mutual Assistance, Protocol\r\non Non-Aggression and Protocol relating to the\r\nMechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management,\r\nResolution, Peacekeeping and Security.\r\nBefore continuing my statement, I should like to\r\njoin my voice to those of previous speakers in\r\nextending to Mr. Han, on behalf of my delegation and\r\non my own behalf, our warmest congratulations on his\r\nelection as President of the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that, thanks to his\r\nexperience and diplomatic skills, the work of this\r\nsession will definitely be successful.\r\nI should like also to extend my warmest\r\ncongratulations to his illustrious predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri, who so ably guided the work of the fifty-fifth\r\nsession.\r\nFinally, I should like to take this opportunity to\r\npay well-deserved tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan. Thanks to\r\nhis skill and his vision, our Organization has regained\r\nits credibility and its primary role in the management\r\nof international affairs. His unanimous re-election to a\r\nsecond term of office, and the fact that he won the\r\nNobel Peace Prize for 2001 together with the United\r\nNations, attest clearly to the great confidence that the\r\nentire international community places in him.\r\nThere cannot be economic progress nor\r\nsustainable development outside an environment of\r\npeace, security and stability. Togo’s foreign policy has\r\nalways been based on the principle of seeking peace,\r\nstability and solidarity between nations.\r\nSince coming to power, the President of our\r\nRepublic, Mr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, has worked to\r\nconsolidate peace. This requires the participation of all\r\ncitizens in political life as well as the construction of a\r\nstate that is truly based on the rule of law, in which all\r\nindividuals can make their contribution and use their\r\nskills in the building of a prosperous nation.\r\nThe President had already begun to democratize\r\npolitical life in Togo by the 1980s. Like any other\r\nhuman endeavour, the promotion of democracy and\r\ngood governance and the consolidation of the rule of\r\nlaw are part of a process that, by necessity, can be\r\nperfected and can evolve and that fits in a given time\r\nand place.\r\nWith various forms of support and aid from our\r\nforeign partners, this process is taking its course and\r\nregistering tangible and real progress. We should like\r\nhere to express our profound thanks to all our\r\ninternational partners who have supported us in our\r\nambition to pursue and achieve political reforms\r\nnecessary to consolidate democracy and rule of law in\r\nTogo.\r\nThe upcoming legislative elections, in March\r\n2002, are organized with the aim of making this\r\nambition more of a reality. In this regard, we are\r\ngrateful to the United Nations for having recently sent\r\nan assessment mission to Togo to make\r\nrecommendations in light of these elections. The long-\r\nawaited upcoming legislative elections, as well as the\r\nproper conduct of the balloting, will, without a doubt,\r\ncontribute to boosting the economy of our country.\r\nFor it is true that progress made in pursuing any\r\nprocess of democratization and establishing the rule of\r\nlaw can be protected only if accompanied by a\r\nsignificant improvement in the living conditions of the\r\npopulations concerned. In other words, to be lasting,\r\nthe advances in promoting civil and political rights and\r\nfundamental liberties should absolutely be underpinned\r\nby the real enjoyment of economic and social rights.\r\nIn such a context, we may well be surprised at the\r\nunjustified continuation of the economic sanctions\r\nimposed on Togo by our main partners in development\r\nfor almost 10 years. What has my country done to\r\ndeserve such a fate? What has the Togolese population\r\ndone to justify its daily suffering? Why apply this\r\npolicy of double standards? Given the way Togo is\r\nbeing treated, are we to see this as an concrete\r\nillustration of the views of the renowned, classic\r\nFrench writer Jean de la Fontaine: “Depending on\r\nwhether you are powerful or weak, the judgement of\r\nthe court will make you white or black”?\r\nThe Togolese people still cannot understand why\r\nTogo — which was one of the first countries in Africa\r\nto be committed to the path of democratization and\r\npolitical reforms and which, in all objectivity, made\r\nprogress in this area — continues to be subjected to\r\nsuch injustice. I would like to make once again an\r\nurgent appeal, on behalf of the Togolese Government\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nand people, for normalization of our cooperative\r\nrelations with our development partners.\r\nPeace, security and stability in Africa are still at\r\nthe heart of our concerns. We note with satisfaction\r\nthat significant progress in settling conflicts has\r\nrecently been made on the continent. I would cite by\r\nway of example the cessation of conflict between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, or the gradual return to normal\r\nconstitutional life in Comores, despite the vicissitudes\r\nof the last few days. All this was made possible thanks\r\nto the efforts of the Organization of African Unity, the\r\nOrganization of la Francophonie and the League of\r\nArab States. These are glimmers of hope and signs of\r\nrelief.\r\nNonetheless, must remains to be done to bring\r\nabout lasting peace and security in certain parts of the\r\ncontinent, notably in the Mano River region, the Horn\r\nof Africa, the Great Lakes Region and Angola.\r\nThe serious crisis endures in the Middle East.\r\nViolence can only beget bitterness and resentment and\r\nperpetuate violence. The hellish cycle of violence that\r\nthe region has known for already more than a year —\r\nin particular, in the occupied Palestinian territories —\r\nhas certainly had an impact on the negotiations being\r\npursued with a view to reaching a just, final and\r\ncomprehensive settlement to the question of Palestine\r\nthat is at the heart of the conflict.\r\nIt is therefore important that the parties in\r\nconflict show greater proof of the necessary political\r\nwill in applying the agreements that have been reached\r\nand work to conclude other arrangements on the basis\r\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions. In this\r\nrespect, Togo welcomes the positive developments that\r\nhave been recently made with respect to the evolution\r\nof the position of certain Member States on the\r\ncreation of a Palestinian State.\r\nHumanity has fully entered the twenty-first\r\ncentury, but the economic and social position of\r\ndeveloping countries remains of concern. In sub-\r\nSaharan Africa and in the least-developed countries in\r\nparticular, we are witnessing an ongoing deterioration\r\nof living conditions and the unprecedented\r\nmarginalization of these countries — a situation that\r\ncan only exacerbate misery and extreme poverty.\r\nDebt burden, the decline in export earnings and\r\nthe lack of sufficient resources for development have\r\ngreatly contributed to making social and economic\r\nconditions worse. Therefore more resources must be\r\nallocated to these areas. In addition to these\r\ninsurmountable difficulties, we now have the\r\npandemics of AIDS and malaria.\r\nAfrica, which is already organizing itself and\r\ntaking matters in hand, expects the international\r\ncommunity to make good on the commitments\r\nundertaken at the Millennium Summit. Against this\r\nbackground, we hope that the major encounters that\r\nwill take place in 2002 — the International Conference\r\non Financing for Development and the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development — will be opportunities to\r\ntake appropriate measures that can genuinely\r\ncontribute to economic growth and poverty reduction.\r\nWe also hope that specific and substantial support will\r\nbe given to Africa in implementing its development\r\nplan, as contained in the New Partnership for\r\nDevelopment in Africa.\r\nAt the start of the millennium, with great changes\r\nunderway in the world, the United Nations still is,\r\nwithout a doubt, the centre for new hopes and\r\nexpectations of humanity. More than ever before, it has\r\nshown itself to be the appropriate framework in which,\r\ntogether, we can and must work to meet the numerous\r\nand complex challenges that humanity faces in the\r\ncontext of an increasingly inexorable process of\r\nglobalization.\r\nWhile continuing to work to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity, promote sustainable economic development\r\nand move towards eradicating the great pandemics, we\r\nalso must confront poverty, injustice, selfishness and\r\nexclusion, which, it seems to me, still are the source of\r\nmany problems that often lead to acts of violence,\r\nterrorism and armed conflict. Thus, and only thus, will\r\nit be possible for us to establish a new international\r\norder of greater justice, solidarity and humanity.\r\nMr. Gatti (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino, I wish to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession and to thank his predecessor for his valuable\r\ncontribution.\r\nI would also like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, who was recently re-elected for a second\r\nterm. Over the past five years, my country has greatly\r\nappreciated his efficiency, charisma and excellent\r\ndiplomatic ability.\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nIn expressing its most sincere satisfaction, the\r\nRepublic of San Marino congratulates the United\r\nNations and its Secretary-General on having been\r\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this\r\nOrganization’s ongoing commitment to peace and\r\nirreplaceable role and of its leader’s outstanding\r\ndiplomatic skills and dedication, which have always\r\ncharacterized his fruitful activity.\r\nQuite understandably, these days the General\r\nAssembly is debating and wondering how and why the\r\nworld could change in just a few hours and how the\r\nprocess of civilization of the international community\r\ncould be so ferociously attacked. We have gathered in\r\nthe most important international forum to define the\r\nrole to be played by each country, individually or\r\nmultilaterally, and to determine how this daunting and\r\ninsidious challenge can be faced by each and everyone\r\nof us. Our discussions should also focus on how to\r\nadjust our national legal systems to better support a\r\nresolute fight against any form of international\r\nterrorism, strengthen our defence systems and promote\r\na common culture of solidarity and firm condemnation\r\nof any violation of and attack on human rights and civil\r\nco-existence, the respect and safeguard of which are\r\ncrucial.\r\nHowever, at a time of enormous difficulties, when\r\nthe wave of hatred and violence seems to be\r\ninexorable, the international community is sending a\r\nstrong signal of hope by showing its determination not\r\nto bend to people who, acting underground, try to\r\nspread terror and turmoil by any possible means. Large\r\nand small countries alike have joined forces to combat\r\nterrorism and have expressed their full solidarity with\r\nthe United States’ outstanding example of democracy\r\nand liberty. To the United States and the families of the\r\nvictims, I wish to express my deepest sympathies and\r\ncondolences.\r\nAlmost all countries have seen the attack on the\r\nUnited States as an attack on each of them. That\r\nexplains why, in the face of such tragedies, many small\r\nnations, too, such as the Republic I represent today,\r\ncannot remain neutral by simply offering solidarity or\r\nmaking statements of principles. Each and every one of\r\nus is called upon to offer a determined and timely\r\ncontribution, however small, to the fight against\r\nterrorism, which my country has always condemned in\r\nall international forums as the main threat to peace.\r\nIn this spirit, San Marino immediately expressed\r\nits willingness to collaborate with the United States of\r\nAmerica and to fully comply with Security Council\r\nresolutions, in particular resolutions 1333 (2000) of 19\r\nDecember 2000 and 1373 (2001) of 28 September\r\n2001. This decision was motivated not only by the fact\r\nthat our Republic has been a Member of this\r\nOrganization for almost a decade, but above all by its\r\ninherent vocation to promote peace and respect for\r\nhuman rights, prompted by the conviction, matured\r\nover 1,700 years of peace and liberty, that any effort in\r\nthis direction helps to create and maintain international\r\nco-existence and mutual respect.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino will spare no effort\r\nin the global fight against terrorism, as it has already\r\ndone to prevent and combat money-laundering. To that\r\nend, it has adopted the necessary legislative\r\ninstruments and effective domestic measures and has\r\nactively participated in the action carried out in this\r\nfield by major international organizations, such as the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, the Council of Europe\r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope.\r\nMy country has successfully integrated many\r\ninternational provisions aimed at countering terrorism\r\nand intends to proceed to the ratification, as soon as\r\npossible, of those instruments that are not yet part of its\r\nlegal system. Indeed, San Marino is well aware of the\r\nimportance and effectiveness of international law,\r\nwhich has been expressly designed to promote\r\ncooperation in this field. In this context, the proposal\r\nsubmitted by India on a comprehensive anti-terrorism\r\nconvention should be taken into consideration as, today\r\nmore than ever, this is a very topical issue that deserves\r\nour greatest attention.\r\nAt the beginning of this new century, mankind\r\ncannot and must not move backwards. That would be\r\nextremely dangerous, as it would challenge the state of\r\ncivilization that mankind has worked so strenuously to\r\nachieve. All free spirits must do their utmost to avert\r\nthis potential defeat and embark on the path of\r\nsolidarity, cooperation and mutual understanding.\r\nI would also like to convey the hope expressed by\r\nthe Government of San Marino and major institutional\r\nbodies for intensified activity by the United Nations, in\r\nthe conviction that a more active role of the\r\nOrganization is needed to face the numerous\r\ninternational challenges that, aside from today’s\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nexceptional circumstances, are still at the top of the\r\nworld political agenda.\r\nOn this occasion, I feel duty-bound to\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General and the President of\r\nthe General Assembly for having implemented, with\r\ngreat determination and courage, a major programme\r\nof reforms aimed at strengthening the United Nations,\r\nwell aware of the fact that only a continuous\r\nmodernization process will enable the Organization to\r\nwork effectively and to keep abreast of future\r\ndevelopments.\r\nIn this regard, San Marino has repeatedly stressed\r\nthe need for a reformed Security Council that, in better\r\nreflecting the new world order, would guarantee a\r\nhigher degree of representativeness, democracy and\r\ntransparency. We believe that such prerogatives can be\r\nensured by simply increasing the number of non-\r\npermanent members. Moreover, San Marino hopes that\r\nthe right of veto may be gradually restricted with a\r\nview to its eventual elimination. Indeed, my country is\r\nconvinced that the exercise of that right, or the mere\r\nthreat of its exercise, still represents a major obstacle\r\nto the proper functioning of the Organization.\r\nEqually important is the ongoing revitalization\r\nprocess of the General Assembly. The progress that has\r\nbeen achieved in terms of greater efficiency makes us\r\nbelieve that the General Assembly will regain its status\r\nas the major decision-making and representative body\r\nof the United Nations. My country hopes that the Ad\r\nHoc Working Group, open to all Member States, will\r\ncarry on this revitalization process.\r\nIn consideration of the pivotal role of the United\r\nNations in fostering international peace and security,\r\nthe Republic of San Marino is of the opinion that this\r\nOrganization is the most appropriate negotiating forum\r\nat the disposal of the community of nations. Besides\r\ncarefully following the Security Council’s efforts to\r\naddress the latest events, my country has paid great\r\nattention to the Council’s ongoing commitment to\r\nsettling the conflicts afflicting Africa. Today more than\r\never, we believe that the immediate implementation of\r\nthat body’s decisions is crucial to restoring peace in a\r\ngeographical area already stricken by poverty,\r\nepidemics and underdevelopment.\r\nSan Marino is also seriously concerned about the\r\nescalation of violence and the increased hostilities in\r\nthe Middle East and hopes that, in that tormented and\r\ncontested land, dialogue and negotiations can be\r\nresumed as the sine qua non of a longed-for world\r\nreconciliation.\r\nAgainst today’s international backdrop, the\r\nphenomenon of globalization also deserves careful\r\nconsideration. I am not referring exclusively to its\r\neconomic and commercial implications, though these\r\nare its most tangible components.\r\nMarket expansion and the progressive abolition\r\nof customs barriers have unquestionably contributed to\r\nexporting job opportunities and, eventually, to\r\neconomic well-being. On the other hand, however, the\r\ngap between the living conditions and standards of the\r\nNorth and the South, of the industrialized countries vis-\r\nà-vis the developing and least developed ones, which\r\nare also burdened by huge foreign debt, has widened\r\ndramatically. That gap must be immediately bridged in\r\norder to guarantee the globalization of opportunities\r\nalong with the globalization of markets.\r\nWe have all witnessed the anti-globalization\r\ndemonstrations in Seattle, Prague and, more recently,\r\nGenoa. Paradoxically, both the participants in the\r\nsummits and the demonstrators were striving for the\r\nsame objectives: poverty eradication, foreign debt\r\nrelief for developing countries and greater\r\nenvironmental protection. I believe that the existence\r\nof common objectives is a first step in the direction of\r\nan open and constructive exchange of views.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino also maintains that\r\npoverty alleviation is one of the major challenges\r\nfacing the international community for the immediate\r\nfuture. Future projects should address not only the lack\r\nof access to consumer goods, but also the lack of\r\neducation, liberty and participation in decision-making.\r\nIn this broader context, poverty is an insurmountable\r\nobstacle to the full enjoyment of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nRecently published data dramatically show that\r\nmore than 1.5 billion people live on less than $2 per\r\nday, and at least two thirds are illiterate; 830 million\r\npeople suffer from severe malnutrition, and 750 million\r\nare homeless, without access to health care. Moreover,\r\nhow can we ignore the fact that hundreds of millions of\r\nchildren are suffering from malnutrition, that 30,000\r\nchildren under five years of age are dying every day\r\nand that more than 500 million of them live on less\r\nthan $1 per day?\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nWell aware of the dramatic situation of many\r\ndeveloping countries, the Republic of San Marino has\r\nfully supported the initiatives sponsored by creditor\r\ncountries and international financial institutions to\r\nreduce or cancel foreign debts of highly indebted\r\nnations. Though not sufficient to mitigate the problem\r\nof poverty or to stop the vicious cycle of misery, these\r\ninitiatives reflect the will of both creditor and debtor\r\ncountries to find jointly a solution for the scourge of\r\npoverty and to share responsibilities.\r\nIt is not utopian to think that, by addressing and\r\nsolving the problems of hunger, poverty and the\r\ndisproportionate social, economic and cultural gaps\r\nbetween a minority living in the North and an\r\noverwhelming, poor and despairing majority living in\r\nthe South, terrorism will also be wiped out in the near\r\nfuture. Indeed, poverty and ideological extremism\r\nserve as fertile soil for terrorism, with its destructive\r\npotential and toll in human lives.\r\nOnce again, the Holy Father has rightly called on\r\nall States and peoples to struggle for justice, since this\r\nis the only way to affirm the pre-eminence of law for\r\nthe international community. Throughout its long and\r\nglorious history of freedom, San Marino has always\r\nfully shared this ideal.\r\nPrompted by these sentiments and determined to\r\nfurther support progressive international détente, for\r\nthe benefit of both nations and individuals, I reiterate\r\nthe hope of the Republic of San Marino that the\r\ninternational community, through the recognized\r\nability of the United Nations system, will be able to\r\ngive new impetus to the principles of dialogue and\r\ncooperation upon which it is based.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Win Aung, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Aung (Myanmar): On behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Union of Myanmar, I wish to extend\r\nour warmest congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on\r\nhis well-deserved election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. His\r\nelection to this high office reflects the trust and\r\nconfidence of all the Member States in his diplomatic\r\nskills and leadership qualities and in his ability to\r\nguide our deliberations to successful conclusions. It is\r\nalso a tribute to his country, the Republic of Korea,\r\nwhich is at the forefront in our common efforts to\r\nachieve the goals of the Organization. In the discharge\r\nof his heavy responsibilities, may I assure him of our\r\nfull support and cooperation.\r\nI also wish to express our deep appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for his able\r\nleadership and valuable contribution during the fifty-\r\nfifth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nour Secretary-General on his re-election to lead the\r\nOrganization for a second term. I also wish to pay\r\ntribute to him for his tireless efforts and far-sighted\r\ninitiatives to strengthen the United Nations. The award\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize to our Secretary-General and\r\nto the Organization is well-deserved recognition in this\r\nregard.\r\nThe international community was greatly shocked\r\nby the recent horrendous terrorist attacks in the United\r\nStates of America. We are profoundly saddened by the\r\nenormous loss of lives and property. We join the\r\ninternational community in extending our deep\r\ncondolences to the people of the United States in\r\ngeneral and the bereaved families in particular.\r\nWherever and by whomever committed, terrorism in\r\nany form or under any circumstances is unjustifiable.\r\nAs a nation that has had bitter experiences with\r\nterrorism, both on its own soil and against its aircraft\r\nand diplomatic service abroad, Myanmar is against\r\nterrorism in all forms and manifestations.\r\nThe challenges of combating terrorism are both\r\ndifficult and complex. Therefore, it is essential that the\r\ninternational community come together under the aegis\r\nof the United Nations to overcome the enormous\r\nchallenge.\r\nIn this regard, I commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor organizing a treaty event at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters from 10 to 16 November 2001. Myanmar\r\nis already a party to 4 of the 12 conventions on\r\nterrorism, and on 12 November we signed the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism and acceded to the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings.\r\nIn the aftermath of the economic crisis of 1997,\r\nAsian countries are still striving to return to a path of\r\nsustained growth. However, the current slowdown in\r\nthe major economies of the world is threatening to\r\nnegate whatever progress they have made. As these\r\neconomies continue with structural reforms to sustain\r\ntheir economic recovery, they are confronted with an\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\ninternational economic and trading environment that is\r\nnot very encouraging.\r\nThis situation is creating difficulties, especially\r\nfor many developing countries and economies in\r\ntransition. Commodity prices are declining due to\r\nweakening world demand. External financing\r\nconditions are also worsening. Factors such as\r\nindebtedness, declining official development assistance\r\nand low levels of domestic and foreign investment\r\ncontinue to undermine the programmes of the most\r\nvulnerable States. It is against this unfavourable\r\nbackdrop that Myanmar is striving to achieve economic\r\ndevelopment of the country.\r\nThere are also hindrances to our efforts to\r\npromote the well-being of our people, such as denial of\r\nofficial development assistance and the application of\r\nunilateral and coercive economic measures. However,\r\nwe are resolute in our efforts to achieve our goals by\r\nrelying on our domestic resources and internal strength\r\nand by putting our comparative advantages to optimum\r\nuse. Our sustained national efforts for development\r\nhave resulted in 8.4 per cent average annual growth\r\nduring the last five-year plan, resulting in a substantial\r\nincrease in per capita income and in better living\r\nstandards for the people.\r\nIn their respective endeavours to bring about\r\neconomic development and social progress, the\r\ndeveloping countries continue to face formidable\r\nchallenges. The debt burden, the declining flow of\r\nofficial development assistance, the lack of market\r\naccess and access to technology, and the decline in\r\nforeign direct investment continue to persist. The\r\nUnited Nations must play a central role in helping\r\nthose countries to help themselves.\r\nIn this regard, we recognize the important role of\r\nUnited Nations funds and programmes in international\r\ncooperation for development. However, their important\r\nrole should not be undermined by practices that are not\r\nin conformity with the principles underpinning the\r\noperation of those funds and programmes. Moreover,\r\nthey should not be used as a platform for exerting\r\npressure on a country that needs and deserves\r\ninternational cooperation in its development efforts.\r\nWhile acknowledging the role of various funds\r\nand programmes, we are particularly appreciative of\r\nthe important role of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP). In United Nations operational\r\nactivities for development, UNDP serves as the\r\nprincipal instrument for capacity-building in\r\ndeveloping countries. Myanmar regrets, however, that\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme is not\r\nallowed to have a country programme for Myanmar.\r\nWhile UNDP continues its useful activities in\r\nMyanmar, it is, however, prohibited from promoting\r\ncapacity-building for reasons other than those for\r\nwhich UNDP was created.\r\nIn the present context of an extremely difficult\r\neconomic and trading environment, the denial of the\r\nright of development to a country in need of\r\ninternational cooperation is a matter that deserves\r\nappropriate redress.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic poses a serious\r\nchallenge to the international community. The response\r\nof the international community and the efforts being\r\nmade at the national, regional and international levels\r\nto counter this global threat are very encouraging.\r\nHowever, the real challenge for us is the high level of\r\nresources needed to combat this disease effectively. It\r\nis therefore most welcome that a global AIDS and\r\nhealth fund has been established. With the\r\ndetermination and will that has been demonstrated in\r\ncurrent efforts, and strengthened with adequate\r\nresources, we are convinced that we will eventually\r\nwin this war on HIV/AIDS. Myanmar fully recognizes\r\nthe nature and gravity of the HIV/AIDS problem, is\r\ntaking the necessary actions at the national level and is\r\nenhancing our cooperation at the regional and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to apprise the\r\nAssembly of the political situation in our country. As\r\nthe Assembly is aware, Myanmar is in the process of\r\nestablishing a multiparty democracy with a sound\r\neconomy. All of the measures that we have taken are\r\ndirected towards that end in a focused manner. This is\r\nthe course of action which we will pursue steadfastly to\r\nits logical end - that is, until democracy is firmly\r\nestablished. We have learned from bitter experience, as\r\nwell as from the lessons of other countries with similar\r\nexperiences, and we are taking great care to ensure that\r\nthe transition to a new system is peaceful, smooth and\r\neffective and that the foundations we are striving to lay\r\nare placed on firm ground.\r\nWe have also been taking effective measures for\r\nnational reconciliation. We have reached arrangements\r\nwith 17 out of 18 armed groups, who are now joining\r\nhands with the Government in national development\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nendeavours. In the same vein, we are also making\r\nnational reconciliation efforts with the political parties.\r\nHere, let me stress what the Secretary-General has so\r\nrightly outlined in his report. Our national\r\nreconciliation efforts are home-grown, and our goal of\r\nbuilding a peaceful and democratic society can be\r\nsuccessfully achieved only by the people of Myanmar.\r\nMyanmar continues to make relentless efforts to\r\ncombat the scourge of narcotic drugs. We have made\r\nconsiderable headway in the suppression of opium and\r\nheroin. The latest figures show that opium production\r\nhas declined by 38 per cent. To achieve this, we tackled\r\nthe problem in a holistic manner. We have strengthened\r\nour legislation; we have enhanced our enforcement\r\ncapacity; and we have combined these measures with a\r\ndevelopment programme to find alternative livelihoods\r\nfor people in remote areas, so that they do not have to\r\nresort to growing opium.\r\nWhile we are taking effective measures against\r\nthe cultivation, production and trafficking of the opium\r\npoppy, we are also taking action against the danger of\r\namphetamine-type stimulants, which are relatively new\r\nbut equally dangerous narcotic drugs. Due to their\r\navailability and affordable price, the widespread use of\r\nthese stimulants among young people has led to an\r\nalarming situation in our subregion. This situation calls\r\nfor renewed efforts at the national level and for\r\nstepped-up cooperation at the subregional level.\r\nTo enhance cooperation at the regional level,\r\nministers from Myanmar, China, Thailand and Laos\r\nmet in Beijing in August and agreed to cooperate\r\nclosely to fight the problem. Our efforts have achieved\r\ntangible results: the seizure of drugs and the arrest of\r\nthe traffickers involved.\r\nMyanmar fully understands how important and\r\nurgent it is to combat this scourge afflicting mankind.\r\nWe have made a firm commitment at the highest\r\npolitical level and are determined to translate these\r\ncommitments into practical and effective measures\r\nwithin the set time-frame.\r\nI wish to inform the Assembly that we have also\r\nenhanced our cooperation with the United Nations\r\nsystem. We continue our cooperation with Mr. Razali\r\nIsmail, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, who\r\ncompleted his fifth visit to the country in August.\r\nAnother visit towards the end of this year has also been\r\nagreed to. Mr. Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, Special\r\nRapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights,\r\nvisited the country twice earlier this year.\r\nDetermined to resolve the issue of forced labour,\r\nMyanmar is fully cooperating with the International\r\nLabour Organization (ILO). In September 2001, an\r\nILO high-level team paid a three-week visit to\r\nMyanmar to objectively assess the practical\r\nimplementation and actual impact of the legislative,\r\nexecutive and administrative measures adopted by the\r\nGovernment to eliminate the practice of forced labour.\r\nThe Government extended its full cooperation to the\r\nteam in arranging its meetings in Myanmar and its fact-\r\nfinding trips to various parts of the country identified\r\nby it. What was most important, we gave the team\r\nunfettered freedom and unlimited access to carry out its\r\nmandate successfully.\r\nLet me now make a few observations concerning\r\nthe work of the Organization. Last year, our heads of\r\nState and Government and leaders gathered in the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall and charted a road-map to\r\nguide our future actions. All our work and energy must\r\nbe directed towards effectively using that road-map to\r\nachieve a peaceful and developed world. Peace and the\r\ndevelopment of nations are the twin objectives of our\r\nOrganization. While globalization has, to a\r\nconsiderable degree, reduced our planet to the village\r\nlevel, the issues we face in achieving peace and\r\ndevelopment are global in scale and complexity. As we\r\nare acutely aware, no one country is capable of\r\nresolving those issues on its own. It is only through\r\nconcerted efforts and genuine partnerships that we will\r\nbe able to address those issues of a global scale.\r\nWe believe that as the only universal forum with\r\nthe most comprehensive mandate, the United Nations\r\nmust play a central role and coordinate our actions in\r\nthose efforts. At the same time, the United Nations\r\nmust be further strengthened and vitalized to be able to\r\ncarry out its global mission effectively and\r\nexpeditiously. That will require the further\r\nstrengthening of its organs and institutions. For our\r\npart, we must provide the Organization with the\r\nresources and the level of support needed to implement\r\nits mandate. It is also vitally important to give real\r\neffect to our pledges through concrete actions if our\r\nOrganization is to be successful in building a world of\r\npeace and development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Kolawolé A. Idji,\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and African Integration of\r\nthe Republic of Benin.\r\nMr. Idji (Benin) (spoke in French): I would first\r\nof all like to express my outrage at the unacceptable\r\nconditions that terrorism has imposed on us at the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly of our\r\nOrganization. New York has traditionally been a\r\nwelcoming and cosmopolitan city. But now, during the\r\nAssembly’s fifty-sixth session, it and our Organization\r\nhave been forced to take on the appearance of a\r\nbesieged fortress.\r\nNo one knows what the terrorists have planned,\r\nnor who their next victims will be. We are all on the\r\nsame side in the face of their diabolical enterprise —\r\non the side of this battered city; on the side of the\r\nAmerican people and their Government; and on the\r\nside of all the innocent victims brought down so\r\ncruelly and coldly in Pennsylvania, Washington and\r\nNew York on that tragic day of 11 September 2001. We\r\nreiterate our profound condolences and sympathy to all\r\nthe bereaved families and to their countries and\r\nGovernments. At the same time, we reaffirm our\r\nunreserved condemnation of terrorism. Terrorism\r\nviolates the principles of all religions. It blemishes all\r\nthe causes on whose behalf it claims to act, even the\r\nmost just among them. It is for that reason that it must\r\nbe combated by all of us without reservation.\r\nThe worldwide awakening aroused by the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001 must cause us all — great\r\nand small, rich or poor — to join in an extraordinary\r\neffort to fight those who have decided to sacrifice us\r\nwithout having ever consulted us about either their\r\nobjectives or war tactics. But it should also be said that\r\nas wholly repugnant as terrorist practices are, they\r\ncannot be eradicated definitively unless the fertile soil\r\nthat feeds the situations that serve as their pretexts is\r\nremoved. The strict respect for human rights and the\r\nrights of peoples that are so rightly enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations should today guide our\r\npolitical practices more than ever before. It is urgent\r\nfor the United Nations to take its proper place in\r\ninternational relations and for it to play the role\r\nincumbent upon it. In that regard, the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council is an urgent and imperative necessity.\r\nPoverty, injustice, exclusion and marginalization\r\nalways result in creating total despair, thereby causing\r\nextremism to flourish. And we know how easily\r\nextremists sacrifice their own lives and those of others.\r\nIt is the duty of all of us, and particularly of the most\r\npowerful among us, to provide the necessary support to\r\neradicate poverty, marginalization, exclusion and\r\ninjustice, and to bear that in mind at all times in the\r\njust, legitimate and resolute struggle against all forms\r\nof terrorism.\r\nThe current tragic events that I have just recalled\r\nheighten our concerns and give greater weight to the\r\nresponsibilities of the President of the General\r\nAssembly. But his personal talents and experience in\r\nworld affairs bolster our conviction that he will\r\nsuccessfully steer the ship of our Organization into port\r\nin these particularly difficult circumstances. For some\r\nyears now, his country and mine have enjoyed friendly\r\nand fruitful relations. He can count on the cooperation\r\nand support of the delegation of Benin in the execution\r\nof his noble mission.\r\nI would also like to pay well-deserved tribute to\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, who guided the United\r\nNations into the new millennium with great spirit. He\r\npresided over the Millennium Assembly with\r\ncompetence and discipline, and we extend to him our\r\ncongratulations and gratitude.\r\nMy congratulations go also to my brother,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, on his well-deserved re-election to the\r\npost of Secretary-General of the United Nations and on\r\nthe Nobel Peace Prize for 2001, awarded to him and\r\nthe Organization he leads with such competence and\r\ndedication. The United Nations has gained a great deal\r\nof credibility thanks in particular to the efforts of\r\nMr. Kofi Annan and his team in the Secretariat. Never\r\nhas there been a more well-deserved prize, and we take\r\npride in it. Indeed, it is all of Africa that is honoured.\r\nOn behalf of the Benin delegation and myself, I would\r\nlike to repeat our warm congratulations and\r\nencouragement.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to address the\r\ninternational community and each Member of the\r\nAssembly to convey the thanks of my country for their\r\nmassive participation at the Fourth International\r\nConference of New or Restored Democracies, held in\r\nCotonou from 4 to 6 December 2000. Indeed, the\r\nCotonou Conference saw record attendance, with 106\r\nStates, 20 international organizations and 51 non-\r\ngovernmental organizations represented, not to mention\r\nacademics and other researchers interested in\r\ndiscovering Benin’s experience of democracy. Benin\r\nwas honoured by the effective participation of three\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nheads of State. The Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations and the Administrator of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme made a point of attending\r\npersonally in Cotonou. We welcome this gracious and\r\ngenerous gesture on their part, and express our\r\ngratitude to all bilateral and multilateral partners, those\r\nfrom the new or restored democracies as well as those\r\nfrom the older democracies who contributed to\r\nfinancing this Conference.\r\nTo judge by its title, “Peace, Security, Democracy\r\nand Development”, the Cotonou Conference was an\r\nimportant stage in the progress of our century towards\r\na consolidation and expansion of democracy. It marked\r\na remarkable advance by its future-oriented approach\r\nand the importance of the document that crowned its\r\nwork, entitled “Cotonou Declaration”. This Declaration\r\nlays out brave and bold measures designed to build\r\ndemocracy and allow to it survive in peace, security\r\nand respect for diverse cultures. There can be no\r\ndemocracy unless it is adapted to the soil in which it is\r\nplanted, even if the values of democracy are universal.\r\nThe Cotonou Conference was also an opportunity\r\nto appreciate how genuine the march towards\r\ndemocracy in Africa is. All peoples want liberty, but\r\nthe institutional and financial capacity to establish it is\r\nweak in many cases, particularly in developing\r\ncountries. That is why my country hopes for more\r\nsubstantial assistance for the strengthening of the\r\ninstitutional capacities of our countries, because\r\ndemocracy can function only if the leaders and their\r\npeoples feel they are equal stakeholders. It is also\r\nessential that within the United Nations system, the\r\nstructure recommended by the Cotonou Conference,\r\nwhile following up the International Conference for\r\nNew or Restored Democracies, be established with a\r\nview to increasing coordination among the different\r\ninitiatives and activities undertaken or contemplated by\r\nthe agencies, programmes and various institutions of\r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nIndeed, the Fourth International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies strove to highlight the\r\nlink that exists between democracy and development.\r\nThe Conference clearly indicated that if democracy is a\r\nforce for stability, poverty is a major factor for\r\ndestabilization and a source of conflicts and war. The\r\ndecisions of the Fourth International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies should not be allowed to\r\nremain dead letters. We must organize cooperation and\r\nsolidarity among all the democracies of the world.\r\nIn the course of the Millennium Summit, which\r\ntook place in this very Hall from 6 to 8 September\r\n2000, major decisions were taken. Among them, pride\r\nof place belonged to those relating to questions of\r\ndevelopment, the elimination of poverty and the\r\nparticular needs of the least advanced countries. The\r\nMillennium Declaration provides, in paragraph 15 of\r\nchapter III:\r\n“We also undertake to address the special\r\nneeds of the least developed countries. In this\r\ncontext, we welcome the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries to\r\nbe held in May 2001 and will endeavour to ensure\r\nits success.” (resolution 55/2, para. 15)\r\nThat Conference was held in Brussels from 14 to\r\n20 May 2001 and produced a Programme of Action\r\nthat was the fruit of very arduous negotiation.\r\nHowever, questions remain. Will the poor countries\r\nsomeday know prosperity? Will they someday be able\r\nto satisfy their basic needs? How will they finance their\r\ndevelopment? Public development assistance is in\r\ndecline. Investment in poor countries remains weak,\r\nand the burden of debt is becoming heavier. What is to\r\nbe done?\r\nWith regard to the question of debt, we think\r\nparticularly bold solutions are required. For the\r\ncreditor countries, it must be recognized these\r\nsolutions are neither simple nor easy. Some of these\r\ncountries have already adopted exemplary and bold\r\nmeasures; others must follow suit. At stake are their\r\nown interests: at stake is the interest of world peace.\r\nThis demand represents to us the symbol of\r\nsolidarity and shared responsibility. That is why the\r\nBenin delegation recommends the urgent establishment\r\nof an effective and highly visible follow-up mechanism\r\nof the Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries.\r\nIn the context of the search for peace and the\r\npromotion of international cooperation, many\r\ndisarmament organizations and other related bodies\r\nwere created to reaffirm that questions of peace and\r\nsecurity and questions of development were\r\ninterdependent and inseparable. The creation of the\r\nZone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic\r\nmeets this need. Its goal is to protect the coastal States\r\nof the southern part of the Atlantic Ocean from the\r\ndangers of nuclear weapons and to create there a zone\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nof peace and strengthening of cooperation for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSince the third ministerial meeting, held in\r\nBrasilia, my country had offered to host the sixth\r\nmeeting, scheduled for the year 2000, but because of\r\nthe organization of the Fourth International Conference\r\nof New or Restored Democracies, this meeting could\r\nnot take place. My country is looking forward to the\r\nearly meeting of this sixth meeting. That is why I\r\nwould like to announce here Benin’s offer to organize\r\nthe sixth ministerial meeting of the States of the Zone\r\nof Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic in the\r\nsecond half of 2003.\r\nA particularly important instrument of South-\r\nSouth cooperation, the Zone of Peace and Cooperation\r\nof the South Atlantic should lay the foundations in\r\nCotonou for its effective and regular functioning within\r\nthe new context of international relations. All of you\r\nhere are welcome to Benin, a marketplace and meeting\r\nplace, a land of democracy and peace.\r\nIt is more urgent than ever to establish such peace\r\nin the Middle East by recognizing as a matter of\r\nurgency on the part of us all the imperative necessity of\r\nthe Palestinian State — side by side, of course, with\r\nthe State of Israel — in peace with all its neighbours\r\nwithin secure and recognized frontiers. This is the\r\nsame peace that Angola and all Africa long for.\r\nMr. Gounaris (Greece), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe must ban all forms of the illicit traffic in\r\npetroleum, diamonds and weapons. These types of\r\nillegal traffic cause and sustain wars, and the\r\ntraffickers are genuine terrorists.\r\nFrom 31 August to 8 September 2001, the\r\nRepublic of South Africa hosted in Durban the World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance. That great\r\ninternational forum, held under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, brought to light the desire for\r\nrehabilitation, justice and fulfilment of the obligations\r\nof memory and acknowledgement, which humanity’s\r\nrecent history has left in the subconscious of certain\r\npeoples. The difficult debates on the thorny questions\r\nraised during the Conference reflect the extent of the\r\ndifficulties in this undertaking that we all fervently\r\ncalled for.\r\nA collective spirit of openness, the impressive\r\nabilities of the host country, the Republic of South\r\nAfrica, and particularly the receptiveness and ability of\r\nmy sister, Ms. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, enabled us to\r\nreach agreement on two encouraging documents: the\r\nfinal Programme of Action and the final Declaration. In\r\nour view, these documents represent the international\r\ncommunity’s renewed commitment to fighting and\r\neradicating the seeds of racism and racial\r\ndiscrimination. The foundation has been laid. Now,\r\naction must follow to make the two Durban documents\r\na reality of everyday life. This does not mean\r\nreopening old wounds; rather, we must all now attend\r\nto healing the wounds of the past.\r\nThe tragic events whose effects we are still living\r\nthrough obliged us to postpone the General Assembly’s\r\nspecial session in follow-up to the World Summit for\r\nChildren. My country hopes that a new date can be\r\ndecided on during this session so that we can assess the\r\nsituation of children in the world 10 years after the\r\nWorld Summit, because much remains to be done to\r\nimprove the lot of children.\r\nAllow me to recall that Benin, having ratified on\r\n3 August 1990 the United Nations Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child, is among the first 22 States of the\r\nworld consenting to be legally bound by this\r\ninstrument. Benin has also ratified the African Charter\r\non the Rights and Welfare of the Child. Articles 12, 13\r\nand 26 of Benin’s Constitution guarantee the right to\r\neducation and the protection of families, mothers and\r\nchildren. Benin’s intentions in this area are also\r\napparent in the creation of a Ministry of the Family,\r\nSocial Protection and Solidarity, which will be devoted\r\nessentially to the implementation of a cohesive and\r\naggressive policy to protect the family, particularly\r\nchildren.\r\nEncouraging results have been achieved at the\r\nnational level, but much remains to be done. We are\r\ndoing admirable work in this area in partnership with\r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and several estimable non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, such as Terre des\r\nHommes, and several other partners of good will.\r\nThose who know Benin can testify to this.\r\nThese collaborative efforts have not stopped\r\ncertain misinformed or ill-intentioned circles in search\r\nof scandals from using the Etireno affair to deceive\r\npeople into believing that the enslavement and selling\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nof children take place in Benin. But neither malicious\r\nintentions nor misinformation nor this sort of\r\nintellectual terrorism will prevent us from making\r\nprogress in terms of democracy, the protection of\r\nwomen and the protection of children from the abuse\r\nthey still suffer in all the countries of the world,\r\nparticularly in poor, underdeveloped countries.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration gave special\r\nattention to Africa under the heading “Meeting the\r\nspecial needs of Africa”. One year later, the countries\r\nof Africa are still waiting for action to begin to be\r\ntaken on those promises. However, Africans are no\r\nlonger willing to wait and have taken their fate into\r\ntheir own hands by creating the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development. The partnership is a\r\nconsequence of the newly restored confidence of\r\nAfricans in their own abilities. It is aimed at placing\r\nthe historic initiative in the hands of Africans\r\nthemselves, without in any way renouncing\r\ninternational cooperation. An important step has thus\r\nbeen taken with this new African joint initiative.\r\nAfricans finally have hope that their continent\r\nwill cease to be the continent of disease, poverty,\r\nmisery and bloody conflicts and that a real partnership\r\ncan be created between us and the rest of the world. It\r\nis our wish that this hope will become reality.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Timothy Harris, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Education of Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis.\r\nMr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to convey to Mr. Han Seung-soo\r\nheartfelt congratulations, on behalf of my delegation\r\nand the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis, on his\r\naccession to the honourable post of President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to congratulate his predecessor\r\non a job well done, especially during such an\r\nexhausting period for the United Nations. The success\r\nof the United Nations is built on the hard work of its\r\nMembers, and both the President and his predecessor\r\nhave shown dedication to the positive functioning of\r\nthis esteemed institution.\r\nIn the last decade, world leaders have been\r\nworking tirelessly in different forums to redefine and\r\naddress the myriad challenges that characterize the so-\r\ncalled new order. This has placed a great premium on\r\nthe United Nations, which has provided an able\r\nplatform for exchanges of ideas, practical dialogue and\r\nconflict resolution. My delegation is satisfied that\r\nmarked progress has been made in identifying many of\r\nthe critical issues. The United Nations deserves high\r\npraise, and we commend Member States for their\r\nwillingness to use the diplomatic and political\r\nresources of the Organization in the conduct of their\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe involvement of the United Nations in recent\r\ntimes is a fitting backdrop for the decision that the\r\ncoming year will be designated the Year of Dialogue\r\namong Civilizations. This is most timely, and it serves\r\nas a revalidation of our belief that dialogue is a critical\r\ningredient in promoting partnership and improved\r\nunderstanding among Governments and peoples.\r\nDialogue is the foundation of solid democracies,\r\nstrong people-centred institutions, civil societies and\r\nsustainable human development. Dialogue is still that\r\nvery important catalyst which often staves off war and\r\nconflict, enabling consensus and confidence-building\r\nin an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. Thus, it is\r\nquite obvious why the Government of Saint Kitts and\r\nNevis supports this idea.\r\nIn a certain sense, a new world order dawned on\r\n11 September 2001, when terrorism, in a most\r\noutrageous form, reared its ugly head in the cities of\r\nWashington and New York, in the United States of\r\nAmerica, with the loss of thousands of innocent lives.\r\nDialogue among members of the international\r\ncommunity rapidly spawned an anti-terrorism coalition\r\nof countries, thereby defining the protagonists in this\r\nunfolding new order. My country stands solidly with\r\nthis coalition, especially in pursuing the generally\r\nagreed strategies to contain terrorism. Despite the\r\nhorrendous act of 11 September and subsequent\r\nbioterrorism, life goes on, adjusted to a new reality.\r\nAnother opportunity where dialogue may prove\r\nuseful in advancing human security will come when\r\nGovernments meet at the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico next\r\nyear. Saint Kitts and Nevis regards this as an important\r\noccasion to promote the interests of all nations. But, we\r\nare especially hopeful that this Conference will\r\nembrace the aspirations and promote better\r\nappreciation for the needs, vulnerabilities and special\r\ncircumstances of small economies in small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nMy Prime Minister has repeatedly urged the\r\ninternational community to take a more unbiased look\r\nat the peculiar situation of small, vulnerable\r\neconomies. This is not an appeal for international\r\ncharity, but a signal to promote the kind of realism\r\nthrough which a Marshall Plan of commitment can be\r\ndevised to energize small, vulnerable economies so that\r\nthey can effectively participate in a globalized\r\neconomy.\r\nDialogue is important in building real\r\nparticipatory democracies. But democracy among\r\nnations is as crucial as democracy within nations.\r\nWhen the people we serve feel that our actions as\r\nleaders do not reflect their dreams, goals and\r\naspirations, they may use their democratic right to\r\neffect change. We have a duty, therefore, to give loud\r\nvoices to their silent legitimate hopes. We must place\r\nadded value on the hopes and expectations of our\r\npeople in order to legitimize the concepts of\r\nrepresentative democracy.\r\nIt is within this context that I urge this body to\r\nredouble its efforts in finding a solution to the\r\nunfortunate stalemate that beleaguers relations between\r\nthe Chinese people across the Taiwan Straits. My\r\nGovernment remains convinced that both sides of the\r\nTaiwan Straits should become fully engaged in this\r\npeaceful and non-coercive process without the\r\ndistraction of preconditions. It would lead to the\r\nsuccessful resolution of what appears to be a very\r\ncontentious issue. At the same time, we encourage the\r\nUnited Nations to be vigilant and ready to assist where\r\npossible or when required. Prior to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of their dispute, it is imperative that we\r\nestablish a mechanism by which the international\r\ncommunity can benefit more appropriately from the\r\nproven expertise, technical know-how and skills of the\r\n23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan.\r\nWe call on the United Nations to assist in the\r\nresolution of the question of full inclusion of Cuba into\r\nthe affairs of the western hemisphere. Also, we urge\r\nthe people of Cuba, as we celebrate the Year of\r\nDialogue among Civilizations, to embrace the\r\nchallenge of ensuring that they can participate fully in\r\nthe community of nations.\r\nParticipatory democracy among nations must be\r\nerected on the twin pillars of mutual respect and trust.\r\nBut trust wanes in the face of unilateral actions such as\r\nthreats made by the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) countries to\r\nblacklist and impose sanctions on sovereign Caribbean\r\nGovernments, consequent upon the OECD countries’\r\nmisunderstanding of fiscal initiatives taken by\r\nsovereign Caribbean Governments as a way to\r\nunderpin sustainable economic development.\r\nAs we celebrate the Year of Dialogue among\r\nCivilizations, we urge Member States to resist the lure\r\nof national paternalism and unilateral action as a means\r\nof problem-solving. In a matter so crucial to the\r\neconomic future of Caribbean countries, it is\r\ninconceivable that conclusions could have been\r\nreached and decisions arrived at without the courtesy\r\nof dialogue with the very countries against whom such\r\nscathing indictments had been made. However, most\r\nrecently, wiser counsel has prevailed and, in a spirit of\r\ndialogue and partnership, significant progress has been\r\nmade by means of a compromise agreement. The\r\nCaribbean Community hails this agreement on offshore\r\nfiscal initiatives as a step in the right direction. Such is\r\nthe power of dialogue among civilizations.\r\nWe imagine that the mechanisms of globalization,\r\nif timely and equitably applied, can be productive,\r\ninclusive, and improve lives. It must be emphasized\r\nthat, although small States may justifiably harbour\r\nsome apprehension about globalization, we do not\r\noppose it. On the contrary, we welcome the\r\nopportunities to empower our citizens so that they may\r\ncompete successfully in a global marketplace, mindful\r\nthat empowerment and the ability to compete\r\nsuccessfully, however, require appropriate skill-sets,\r\nacademic resources and material tools. In order for\r\nsmall States to benefit fully from the new economic\r\norder, the global agenda must become a humane\r\nagenda, sufficiently responsive to facilitate equitable\r\nand affordable access to modern technology — that is\r\nto say, technology that is appropriate and responsive to\r\nthe basic needs of poor communities and small States.\r\nWithout realism and a holistic approach in\r\nexamining the social and economic conditions within\r\nsmall States, there is a potential for serious dislocation\r\nwhen these States attempt to operate within the global\r\nmarketplace. As responsible Member States, we have a\r\ngenuine obligation to work towards improving the lives\r\nof the disenfranchised. This, I am sure, is the main\r\nreason we are here today. Therefore, we must continue\r\nto right this important chapter in the development of\r\nhuman security. We must also remain cognizant that, as\r\nmembers of the global village, we have to discard old\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nsuspicions and embrace new partnerships, dialogue and\r\ndiversity as necessary components of our\r\ninterdependence.\r\nPartnership and understanding will prove\r\nessential in our efforts to tackle common problems\r\nsuch as drug trafficking and the pandemic of\r\nHIV/AIDS. The special session on HIV/AIDS came at\r\nan important juncture, and we urge Member States to\r\nsupport the decisions that were taken. In small States,\r\nlike Saint Kitts and Nevis, the pandemic of HIV/AIDS\r\npresents one of the most devastating challenges to the\r\ndevelopment of human security, because such a disease\r\nthreatens to unravel the delicately woven balance of\r\nsocial growth and economic potential.\r\nOur people are at great risk, and the prospect of\r\nlosing decades of development and talented people to\r\nthis illness is amazingly real. On top of losing their\r\nyoung and most productive people, Governments are\r\nexpected in turn to reallocate significant amounts of\r\nalready meagre resources from critical development\r\nprograms to provide costly care and treatment. We\r\nsalute the United States Government, the World Bank,\r\nand others for their recent and important initiatives to\r\nhelp fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the Caribbean\r\nand we urge others to adopt similar initiatives.\r\nWe see what an important role dialogue is playing\r\nin the hemispheric approach at the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS) through the Multilateral\r\nEvaluation Mechanism. This allows member\r\nGovernments to collaborate in the fight against drug\r\ntrafficking, in supply and demand initiatives and in the\r\nimplementation of national or shared strategies. We\r\nbelieve this approach is useful, because it makes\r\ncommon approaches more frequent, discourages\r\nunilateral actions and allows member States to share\r\nexperiences on interdiction, the epidemiology of drug\r\nabuse and other trends. The fight against drug\r\ntrafficking, you will agree, is a transnational one. We\r\ncannot point fingers or apportion blame. We need to\r\ntake action.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the approach of\r\nthe OAS, which permits us in the Caribbean to work in\r\na multilateral framework to find common solutions.\r\nEqually, such a mechanism focuses attention on the\r\nroot problems and encourages hemispheric partnership.\r\nWe hope that these kinds of approaches will become\r\nintegral components of problem solving at the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn closing, the past year was particularly eventful.\r\nWe began with the Millennium Summit and concluded\r\nwith the HIV/AIDS special session. In between, we\r\ninteracted on many contentious issues. It is my hope\r\nthat during the new year we can move forward with\r\nrenewed vigour, building on the hard work that our\r\npredecessors left in our charge, and paving the way for\r\na brighter future for those to whom we will pass the\r\nbaton. Once again, we salute the President on behalf of\r\nthe people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Monie Captan, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nMr. Captan (Liberia): I am honoured to\r\nparticipate in this historic session on behalf of His\r\nExcellency Dr. Charles Ghankay Taylor, President of\r\nthe Republic of Liberia, and to share with the\r\nAssembly his contribution to this debate.\r\nI am pleased to congratulate the President on his\r\non your election as President of the fifty-sixth General\r\nAssembly. We wish to assure His Excellency of the full\r\ncooperation of the Liberian delegation.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to acknowledge\r\nthe outgoing President, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland,\r\nfor the very able manner in which he conducted the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly.\r\nBy the same token, I would like to congratulate\r\nour distinguished Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\non his re-election as Secretary-General and for the\r\ndistinguished recognition he received in being awarded\r\nthe Nobel Peace Prize, which, without a doubt, is a\r\nresult of his vision, commitment and the efficient\r\nmanner in which he has led and continues to lead our\r\norganization.\r\nOn 11 September 2001, not very far from this\r\nplace, which is dedicated to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the world was\r\nconfronted with a kind of terrorism that now renders all\r\nof us vulnerable. This terrorism is not confined to any\r\none group of people, nor is it confined to any one\r\ngeographical location, or to any particular ethnic or\r\nreligious group. Because of its transnational nature, the\r\nworld must come together and, in a coordinated and\r\ncollective manner, construct new models in answer to\r\nthis scourge. We must act without delay, and without\r\nunnecessary debate. We must act with determination\r\nand urgency.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nThe problem of terrorism today requires that our\r\nOrganization, the United Nations, should take the lead\r\nin coordinating and consolidating international efforts\r\nto tackle the new challenges that it raises. The United\r\nNations should serve as a catalyst for these efforts, and\r\nnot another bureaucratic web of inaction and prolonged\r\ndebate. The United Nations — the institution that\r\nhumanity has charged with the responsibility for global\r\npeace and security — is today the subject of terrorist\r\nthreats. We must match our words with deeds; we must\r\nrespond to this scourge.\r\nMy Government reiterates its condemnation, in\r\nthe strongest terms, of the barbaric and heinous acts of\r\nterrorism perpetrated against the United States, leading\r\nto unimaginable and enormous loss of lives and\r\nmassive destruction in New York, Washington, D.C.,\r\nand Pennsylvania. My Government has made concrete\r\noffers to the United States Government and the\r\ninternational coalition, and has taken strong measures\r\nin keeping with Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001).\r\nI wish now to proceed to issue of reform of the\r\nUnited Nations. I believe, like the rest of you, that\r\nreform implies change towards a more positive\r\ncondition. And I presume that when we speak of the\r\nUnited Nations, we speak of nations that have come\r\ntogether with a common interest to achieve a common\r\nobjective. In essence, when we speak of reform, we\r\nmust accept that the conditions under which our\r\nnations have come together — with a common interest\r\nto achieve a common objective — are no longer\r\npalatable and require change. The questions that many\r\nof us continue to debate regard what changes we want,\r\nand how to achieve those changes.\r\nHowever, I must interject a fundamental question\r\nas to whether the conditions, practices and traditions\r\nexist for a positive change, assuming we mean positive\r\nfor the collective good. In bringing about any positive\r\nchange for the collective good, a level playing field\r\nmust exist, in which the interest of the whole will\r\nfreely manifest itself in the change. A level playing\r\nfield should show the following characteristics:\r\ntransparency; freedom; fairness; and democratic\r\npractices.\r\nIn terms of transparency, we must assume a\r\ncondition in which the operation of and decision-\r\nmaking process within the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies are open. The Security Council\r\nshould not deliberate in secrecy, as was the case during\r\nthe pre-World War II years, in which secret diplomacy\r\nand alliance formations characterized the period.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn terms of freedom, we must assume that\r\nMembers of the United Nations can take decisions in\r\nthe absence of threats, coercion, fear and retribution.\r\nIn terms of fairness, we must assume that\r\ndecisions cannot be taken in contradiction to universal\r\nmoral imperatives, or to the detriment of the statehood\r\nof a Member. Sanctions with adverse socio-economic\r\nand humanitarian consequences should not constitute\r\npolitical tools available to a few Members.\r\nIn terms of democratic practices, we must assume\r\nthat decision-making will be reflective of the will of\r\nthe majority and not of a few; that all Members will\r\nhave an equal say and equal participation.\r\nUnfortunately, the contrary of these preconditions\r\nconstitutes the status quo today with regard to the\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations. How can we assume\r\nthe possibility of reform in the absence of a level\r\nplaying field?\r\nReform can be meaningful only in the context of\r\nthe alteration of the spirit of the Charter. That, as I\r\nhave suggested, would assume the presence of a level\r\nplaying field. However, we must all admit that the\r\nconcept of reform has gained currency only because of\r\nan attempt to admit emerging Powers into the elite\r\ngroup of permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nSuch an attempt has provoked an outcry against the\r\nprivilege of the few, and the challenge is how to admit\r\nthese emerging Powers without disrupting the existing\r\nallocation of privilege. Privilege is never surrendered.\r\nIt is shared only when the political structures compel\r\ninclusion.\r\nReform will not occur within the United Nations\r\nuntil structural changes take place in the distribution of\r\npower and more non-traditional Powers emerge. It\r\nwould therefore be an exercise in futility to expect\r\nconcrete reforms in the United Nations without\r\nstructural changes. And what we assume to be reform\r\nis essentially an adjustment occasioned by structural\r\npressures. This adjustment would be limited to\r\naccommodating the newly emerging Powers, while\r\nappeasing the less powerful States through\r\nparticipation without power. The conferral of the right\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nof veto will mark this distinction. A permanent seat\r\nwill no longer be synonymous with the right of veto.\r\nFor the less powerful, the struggle will not be\r\nabout power, but participation by affiliation, a sort of\r\nstatus club. Prestige is a preoccupation of the national\r\ncharacter, which, despite its superficiality, will be\r\npursued by States seeking to distinguish themselves\r\nfrom the crowd. Hence, the focus of the less powerful\r\nwill be to join the club, and not the pursuit of the more\r\nimportant goal of integration, which is the only answer\r\nfor the conversion of the less powerful into emerging\r\nPowers that would compel adjustment through\r\nstructural pressures. Debate is not the mechanism of\r\nchange.\r\nIndividual less powerful States can hope to\r\nemerge as powerful States only through a process of\r\nintegration within regional groupings where power in\r\nits entire composite is integrated into a common power\r\ncapability. This would require integration of economic,\r\nmilitary, technological, human, political and social\r\nresources into an integrated regional capacity. Only\r\nwhen this objective is achieved will the structure of the\r\ninternational political system yield to adjustment.\r\nAfrica cannot, with all of its potential, continue to\r\nstand by and accept being condemned to perpetually\r\noccupy the position of the least developed continent.\r\nThe African culture, heritage and value systems stand\r\nthe risk of being lost in the sea of normative ethics\r\nbased on Western values. Africa should not miss the\r\nopportunity of the new African Union to achieve\r\nmeaningful integration and cooperation within the\r\ncontext of building a powerful African capability that\r\nwill allow Africans a say in our common world. This\r\nwill require a new pragmatism, commitment, vision,\r\ncooperation and sacrifice on the part of African\r\nleaders. The United Nations can work for Africa; we\r\nshould learn from the successes of the power brokers\r\nwho have made the United Nations an important\r\ninstrument of their foreign policy.\r\nLiberia is a small country in West Africa that\r\nsuffered seven years of civil war from 1990 to 1997.\r\nDuring the years of the civil war most institutions were\r\ndestroyed, and a major brain drain resulted, as many\r\nLiberian professionals travelled abroad to better\r\nconditions. The war also resulted in the destruction of\r\nbasic infrastructure, including power-generating plants,\r\nwater plants, schools, hospitals, airports, bridges and\r\nprivate property. Over 666,000 Liberians ended up as\r\nrefugees and over a million as internally displaced\r\npersons. More alarming was the failure of the\r\ninternational community to assist in the reintegration of\r\nover 60,000 former combatants who remained\r\nunemployed and idle.\r\nIn 1997 a constitutionally elected Government\r\nwas inaugurated facing the challenges of restoring a\r\nnation that had been destroyed by war. Four years later,\r\nthe infant Government still faces an unsympathetic\r\ninternational community; it has received no official\r\ndevelopment assistance, and donor assistance for\r\nUnited Nations agencies and the non-governmental\r\norganizations operating in Liberia has declined over the\r\npast four years. The current unemployment rate is 85\r\nper cent, while 80 per cent of the population lives\r\nbelow the poverty line. According to the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the illiteracy rate is estimated\r\nat 80 per cent. Half of all school-age children do not\r\nattend school. Infant mortality stands at 134 out of\r\n1,000 live births.\r\nDisability prevalence in the population is 16.4 per\r\ncent, of which 12.7 per cent is war-related. The World\r\nHealth Organization rate for a post-war country is\r\nbetween 7 per cent and 10 per cent. The prevailing\r\ncauses of disabilities are alarming, with 91.5 per cent\r\nacquired due to trauma and diseases. About 21 per cent\r\nof urban dwellers and 80 per cent of rural dwellers\r\nhave no access to safe drinking water. Access to\r\nadequate sanitation is unavailable to approximately 70\r\nper cent of the population. An estimated 8 per cent of\r\nthe population is reportedly infected with HIV.\r\nSince 1999, dissidents have waged war in Lofa\r\nCounty against the constitutionally elected Government\r\nin Liberia, further exacerbating the already vulnerable\r\nhumanitarian situation in the country. Death,\r\ndestruction, displacement of populations and an\r\nincrease in Liberian refugees have contributed to what\r\nthe United Nations agencies call a humanitarian crisis\r\nin Liberia.\r\nThe Liberian Government’s capacity to defend its\r\nterritorial integrity has been impaired by a United\r\nNations arms embargo, despite the right to self-\r\ndefence, as expressed in Article 51 of the United\r\nNations Charter. The Security Council has taken no\r\nmeasures to prevent the ongoing killing of innocent\r\nLiberians, especially women and children, who are the\r\ntargets of atrocities committed in Lofa county by armed\r\ndissidents.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nThis country, a victim of war, poverty and\r\ndisease, is today also the victim of a regime of punitive\r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council in its\r\nresolution 1343 (2001). The representative of the\r\nUnited Nations Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs told the Security Council on 5\r\nNovember 2001 that the humanitarian situation in\r\nLiberia today is “abysmal”. (S/PV.4405, p. 32) Since\r\nthe imposition of sanctions by the Security Council,\r\nand despite the claim by the Council that the sanctions\r\nwould not have any adverse effects on ordinary people,\r\nsocio-economic indicators show that the living\r\nconditions of the Liberian people have declined\r\ndramatically. Available statistics show a direct\r\ncorrelation between the imposition of sanctions and the\r\ndecline in the living standards of the Liberian people.\r\nThe Security Council has imposed a global travel\r\nban on more than 100 Liberians, without any\r\nrationalization. My Government has requested the\r\nSecurity Council to make known its criteria for the\r\ninclusion of persons subject to the travel ban. This\r\nminimal element of transparency and justice has been\r\ndenied the Liberian Government. Among those\r\nsubjected to the travel ban are the sick, invalids,\r\nbusinessmen, wives and ex-wives. What a frightening,\r\nalarming and dangerous precedent the Security Council\r\nhas set. Liberia speaks not for itself, as it has already\r\nbeen victimized, but for the rest of you here, who may\r\nfind similar treatment meted out against yourselves\r\ntomorrow.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nI await impatiently for a tomorrow when there\r\nwill be redress from the injustice my country suffers,\r\nwhen all of you here will no longer be obliged to\r\nenforce unjust sanctions. Today, I am impatient to hear\r\nthe General Assembly voice its opposition to the\r\nsuffering imposed upon Liberian children, women and\r\nelderly persons. I impatiently wait for each and every\r\nmember of the Security Council to respect the human\r\nrights of my people. I am impatient for the day when\r\nthe United Nations will no longer be an instrument that\r\nis used to cause the suffering of innocent people. The\r\nGovernment of Liberia calls upon the Security Council\r\nto lift all sanctions imposed upon it and to bring to an\r\nend the suffering of the Liberian people.\r\nAt the twenty-sixth session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly, in 1971, a major decision was taken\r\nthat to date has had far reaching implications. On 25\r\nOctober of that year, after two decades of debate, by\r\nvirtue of General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI)\r\nadopted by a vote of 76 in favour, 36 against and 17\r\nabstentions) the Republic of China was expelled from\r\nthe world body. By that decision, a founding Member\r\nand its population — at that time of 14 million\r\npeople — were effectively prevented from associating\r\nwith the rest of the world. Nothing in the Charter\r\njustified such a decision, yet a precedent was set that is\r\nstill unsurpassed. Nevertheless, it is the conviction of\r\nthe Liberian Government that the now 23 million\r\npeace-loving people of the Republic of China should be\r\nallowed representation and participation in our world\r\nbody. It is also the hope of the Liberian people that the\r\ngreat Chinese people will one day be peacefully\r\nreunited under the principles of democracy and human\r\nrights.\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to allay the anxieties of\r\nall those who are preoccupied with the existing\r\nsituation between the members of the Mano River\r\nUnion. The leaders of the three Mano River Union\r\nStates have resolved to put all of their differences aside\r\nand not to return to the destructive process of\r\napportioning blame. We are a single people bound by\r\nblood, culture and language. We are bound by a\r\ncommon destiny that links us inextricably to one\r\nanother and is capable of withstanding ephemeral\r\ndifferences. I wholly agree with President Conté of\r\nGuinea when he described our quarrel as a family\r\nmatter. Our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters,\r\nand mothers and fathers have commenced the process\r\nof reconciliation and confidence-building in Freetown,\r\nConakry and Monrovia. So far, a number of significant\r\ndecisions have been taken at the level of ministers for\r\nforeign affairs and the Joint Security Committee. We\r\nask for the Assembly’s support in that process.\r\nI would be remiss if I failed to acknowledge the\r\ntrue fraternal solidarity and support of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States, which has stood\r\nthe test of all of our challenges and difficulties and\r\nremains focused on the objective of peace. We too will\r\nremain focused on the objective of peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHer Excellency The Honourable Lilian Patel, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nMalawi.\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nMs. Patel (Malawi): At the outset, I would like to\r\nconvey the condolences of the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Malawi to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica, as well as to the people and Government of\r\nthe Dominican Republic and other countries whose\r\nnationals died in the plane crash that occurred in\r\nQueens, here in New York, on 12 November 2001.\r\nSimilarly, I also wish to convey my condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Algeria, following the\r\nrecent flood disaster in which many lives were lost and\r\nmuch property was damaged.\r\nOn behalf of the Malawi delegation, I feel deeply\r\nhonoured to join my fellow representatives in\r\ncongratulating Mr. Han Seung-soo on his assumption\r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly. My\r\ndelegation looks forward to working closely with him\r\nover the coming months in the pursuit of sustainable\r\nsolutions to the major global concerns and challenges\r\nthat continue to confront humankind and in the\r\npromotion of international peace, security and\r\nunderstanding.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to express\r\nMalawi’s deep appreciation of and thanks to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, for his\r\nexceptional skills, expertise and unswerving\r\ncommitment. We have noted with appreciation how his\r\ntireless efforts and tenacity have resulted in progress\r\non most of the items of the agenda during his\r\npresidency.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nour Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the United\r\nNations as a whole, for being jointly awarded the\r\nNobel Peace Prize for the year 2001. This demonstrates\r\nthe world’s recognition of the great strides the\r\nOrganization and the Secretary-General have made in\r\ncarrying forward the mandate of the United Nations.\r\nThis achievement is a rare feat that we should be proud\r\nof, and it should serve to encourage all of us to do\r\nmore for the good of humanity.\r\nI would also like to reiterate the congratulations\r\nof the Government of Malawi to Mr. Kofi Annan on his\r\nappointment to the post of Secretary-General for a\r\nsecond term of office.\r\nIt is appalling and extremely unfortunate that at a\r\ntime when we thought we were making progress in\r\nhuman development, some people among us conducted\r\nheinous and abhorrent acts of terrorism. The terrorist\r\nattacks in this country on 11 September serve to remind\r\nus that the global village we are living in is under\r\nthreat from people who do not value human life and\r\ndemocratic values. The Government of Malawi\r\nbelieves that no cause or rationale can justify terrorism\r\nas a means of achieving individual or group goals, as\r\nsuch acts result in indiscriminate destruction of human\r\nlife and property. Clearly, it is evident that no nation\r\nwill be spared the far-reaching, devastating impact of\r\nthe attacks of 11 September.\r\nThe Government of Malawi unreservedly\r\ncondemns those acts and pledges its support and\r\ncooperation in the fight against such unjustifiable\r\ncriminal acts. It is our sincere hope that all those\r\nresponsible for the terrorist attacks on the United States\r\nof America and, indeed, elsewhere in the world, will\r\nspeedily be brought to justice. As we all share\r\nsympathy with the victims of the recent terrorist\r\nattacks, let us also demonstrate our unanimous resolve\r\nto deal with this problem in a decisive and conclusive\r\nmanner by ratifying or acceding to all conventions\r\naimed at combating terrorism. That will send a strong\r\nmessage to all parts of the world about our common\r\npurpose to remove this evil from our midst.\r\nIt is common knowledge that terrorist groups and\r\nindividuals or entities operate in sophisticated\r\nnetworks throughout the world. No country, therefore,\r\ncan decisively deal with this problem alone. It is\r\nimperative that we all pool our resources to resolutely\r\ndeal with the cancer of terrorism. Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) forms a sound and clear basis\r\non which our cooperation should be anchored. It is\r\nabundantly clear that, if this resolution can be seriously\r\nimplemented, it may effectively frustrate and check\r\nterrorist activities.\r\nIt will be recalled that the strategic priority of the\r\nMillennium Summit held last year was to find ways of\r\nreshaping and reorienting the focus of the United\r\nNations that would inspire a renewed and shared sense\r\nof universal mission, thereby enabling it to make a real,\r\nquantifiable difference in the lives of “We, the peoples”\r\nin the new millennium.\r\nAnd yet, regrettably, one year after that watershed\r\nevent, the commitments of the Millennium Summit\r\nalready seem to be anything but what they are —\r\ncommitments — and to be mere platitudes on the part\r\nof the developed countries. The Summit’s much-\r\ntrumpeted visions, goals and collective social\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nobjectives already appear to have been consigned to the\r\nsame fate of non-fulfilment that has befallen similar,\r\nprevious commitments of the rich nations.\r\nIt is saddening that, at the height of a global\r\nintegration drive, a shockingly large number of\r\ncountries remains outside the globalization loop, while\r\na handful of economically powerful countries of the\r\nNorth controls the pace and terms of participation in\r\nthe global economy, not least the skewed distribution\r\nof its benefits. It is equally disheartening to note, in\r\nparticular, that the African continent is nowhere near\r\nattaining even half as much of the benefit that it has\r\nstrenuously striven for in the global economy. Now\r\nmore than ever, our continent is fast sliding deeper and\r\ndeeper into a plight of deteriorating mass poverty.\r\nThis situation is aggravated by mounting external\r\ndebt, crumbling public infrastructure, marginally\r\nfunctional social services, severe environmental\r\ndegradation, rising illiteracy and the rapid depletion of\r\nhuman resources and the skilled labour force as a result\r\nof endless armed conflicts and the devastation caused\r\nby epidemics, such as those of HIV/AIDS, malaria,\r\ntuberculosis and other transmissible infections. These\r\nare some of the many issues that we have discussed\r\ntime and again in this Assembly and other forums, and\r\nyet we seem to be getting nowhere.\r\nClearly, Africa is under the threat of imminent\r\nvirtual exclusion from the mainstream global\r\neconomy — more so if the underlying spirit, ideals,\r\ngoals and commitments of the Millennium Summit are\r\nnot faithfully upheld to ensure the concrete and\r\neffective integration of the developing countries into\r\nthe global economic framework on terms that reflect a\r\nshared future of promise of equality, equity, prosperity\r\nfor all and a just world.\r\nIn spite of all these apprehensions, my delegation\r\nis still encouraged by the wide global consensus on a\r\nrange of major issues of critical concern to the least\r\ndeveloped countries of Africa. The positive\r\nconclusions reached during the special session on\r\nHIV/AIDS and the world Conferences that took place\r\nthis year — the Third United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Least Developed Countries, the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects and the World\r\nConference against Racism and Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance — reflect a newly\r\nemerging global recognition that there is an urgent\r\nneed to begin concretely addressing the issues that will\r\naggressively advance the economic and social progress\r\nof the less developed nations. The declarations and\r\nprogrammes of action agreed at those Conferences\r\nmust be the centrepiece of any genuine international\r\ncrusade to reduce social and economic disparities and\r\ninequalities between the North and the South. Indeed,\r\nthe persistence of these inequalities and injustices, in\r\nour view, is the root cause of the political, economic\r\nand social turmoil currently tearing apart the African\r\ncountries and some parts of the world. Malawi would\r\nlike to reaffirm its steadfast commitment to the\r\ndeclarations of commitment, actions and programmes\r\nagreed at these Conferences.\r\nWhat the developing countries need is a chance\r\nfor a fresh start, which can come about only through a\r\ncomprehensive package of total debt forgiveness that\r\ncuts across the existing initiatives for debt relief,\r\nincluding the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative. We also need increased\r\ntechnical assistance, enhanced official development\r\nassistance and much greater flows of capital resources\r\nand foreign direct investment from developed\r\ncountries.\r\nWe would also like to insist on the genuine\r\ncommitment of the North to the full integration of our\r\neconomies into globalized markets through the removal\r\nof technical obstacles placed in the way of our exports.\r\nThe United Nations ought to play a leading role in\r\nbreaking down the walls of protectionism and to\r\nsustain the search for measures that can help the poor\r\nnations wriggle out of their poverty and vulnerability.\r\nThis is in line with the spirit of the resolutions and\r\ndecisions taken at last year’s World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nI take this opportunity to pay special tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the numerous\r\ninitiatives that he has undertaken to prevent violent\r\nconflicts in Africa and other troubled regions of the\r\nworld. The recent release to the Security Council of his\r\nspecial report on conflict prevention, which addresses\r\nin depth the many issues that arose from the Brahimi\r\nreport, is one practical demonstration of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s overpowering resolve to ensure that the\r\ninternational community addresses political disputes\r\nand tensions before they degenerate into all-out armed\r\nconfrontations and violent conflicts. These pose a\r\nmajor challenge and real threat to international peace\r\nand security.\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nIn the same vein, to effectively tame violent\r\nconflicts, the United Nations needs to deal decisively\r\nwith the problem of the illicit trade and trafficking in\r\nsmall arms and light weapons. Their easy availability,\r\ntransfer and proliferation remain at the centre of the\r\nintractability of violent conflicts, rising insecurity and\r\ninstability in some parts of Africa.\r\nMy delegation is most thankful for the success,\r\nalbeit measured, achieved during the recent United\r\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. In spite of a\r\nspirited bid by others to water down the agreed global\r\nconsensus and programme of action, Africa takes heart\r\nin the holding of the Conference itself as a good\r\nstarting point for putting in place effective measures to\r\ncurb the immeasurable damage caused by these deadly\r\nweapons.\r\nMany evils such as slavery, the slave trade,\r\ncolonialism, apartheid, genocide, the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, poverty and starvation have afflicted the\r\ncontinent of Africa and its people. These evils have\r\nbeen entrenched to such an extent that even the\r\ninternational media only look forward to reporting on\r\nthe tragedies befalling the continent. However, despite\r\nthese ills, Africa deserves a special place in the\r\neconomic, political and social spheres of the world. It\r\nis in cognizance of this fact that our leaders, in their\r\nquest for a prosperous and dynamic Africa, resolved to\r\ntransform the Organization of African Unity into the\r\nAfrican Union.\r\nThe birth of the Union has ushered in the New\r\nAfrican Initiative, now renamed the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development, which seeks to pull Africa\r\nout of stagnation and put the continent on a new\r\nfooting for economic recovery and prosperity as well\r\nas for the promotion of human rights and good\r\ngovernance. As a developing region with very limited\r\nfinancial resources, we shall rely on our cooperating\r\npartners in order to ensure that our dream for a new\r\nAfrica is realized. Therefore, I wish to appeal for\r\nglobal support for this noble initiative being espoused\r\nby our leaders so that the people of the African\r\ncontinent may see real social, economic and political\r\ntransformation for the betterment of their lives.\r\nMalawi recently assumed the one-year rotating\r\nchairmanship of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC). While SADC member States take\r\npride in the relative peace and stability that prevail in\r\nmuch of the subregion, we still have serious concerns\r\nabout the persistent general economic slowdown and\r\nthe deterioration of human development in the\r\nsubregion. SADC is experiencing an unfair share of\r\nproblems and challenges which require the\r\ninternational community’s enhanced generous\r\nassistance and good will.\r\nIt is common knowledge that SADC is reeling\r\nunder the pressures of the untold devastation caused by\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is unravelling decades\r\nof hard-earned economic gains. The subregion\r\naccounts for 75 per cent of the world’s total number —\r\nthat is, 36 million — of people living with deadly\r\nHIV/AIDS. SADC’s modest average economic growth\r\nrate of 3.2 per cent becomes a cause for serious\r\nconcern when compared with its staggering population\r\ngrowth rate of nearly the same level.\r\nApart from causing untold human suffering, the\r\ncontinuing civil wars in Angola and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo — two of the subregion’s\r\npotential economic powerhouses — have hamstrung\r\nevery genuine endeavour by SADC to promote itself as\r\na prime destination for foreign capital and investment.\r\nTherefore, we call upon the United Nations to step up\r\nits efforts to bring pressure to bear on the belligerents\r\nin Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nso that the ongoing peace initiatives can yield the rich\r\nrewards of an early and decisive settlement. We also\r\ncall upon the international community to continue\r\nrendering vital support and cooperation to the peace\r\nfacilitator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\r\nensure that the inter-Congolese dialogue bears fruit and\r\nserves to consolidate the gains achieved so far by the\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation and the Lusaka\r\npeace process.\r\nSADC would also like to see much more pressure\r\nexerted on Jonas Savimbi in order to force UNITA to\r\nreturn to the 1994 Lusaka peace framework. Only the\r\nintensification of the United Nations sanctions against\r\nUNITA and the punishment of those violating the\r\nembargo would genuinely achieve that goal.\r\nThe attainment of durable peace and stability in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola and\r\nthe removal of tensions in the rest of the subregion\r\nwould put SADC on a stronger footing for economic\r\nrecovery and a firmer foundation for sustainable peace,\r\nsecurity and tangible economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nTime and again, Malawi has spoken in favour of\r\nreadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to\r\nUnited Nations membership, which would grant to that\r\ncountry a well-deserved opportunity for active\r\nengagement in international affairs. Malawi finds it\r\ngrossly unjust that the hard-working and peace-loving\r\npeople of Taiwan should suffer diplomatic isolation so\r\nunnecessarily. Therefore, Malawi would like to appeal\r\nto the entire United Nations membership to look\r\nbeyond narrow political considerations and face up to\r\nthe geopolitical and economic realities that obtain on\r\nboth sides of the Taiwan Straits. The diplomatic\r\nisolation of Taiwan remains both a curiosity and a\r\ncontradiction in terms. First, almost every country\r\ndeals with Taiwan in terms of trade and other forms of\r\nbilateral cooperation. Secondly, the isolation of Taiwan\r\nviolates its people’s inalienable right to free association\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations Charter.\r\nLastly, let me reaffirm Malawi’s trust and\r\nconfidence in the leadership role of the United Nations\r\nin making our world a better place in which to live. I\r\nwould also like to reaffirm Malawi’s unwavering\r\ncommitment to its obligations and responsibilities as a\r\nmember of the international community of nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Jigmi Yoser Thinley, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Bhutan.\r\nMr. Thinley (Bhutan): I congratulate the\r\nPresident on his assumption of the difficult role of\r\nguiding the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.\r\nThis session is being held during one of the saddest\r\nmoments in the history of our Organization. Let me\r\nassure the President of the full support of my\r\ndelegation in the discharge of his most important\r\nfunctions.\r\nThe twenty-first century will forever be\r\nremembered for the fiery hell that engulfed the world\r\non that dark day of a cloudless sky on 11 September.\r\nThe horrific images of passenger aircraft flying to their\r\ndoom to cause great death, grief and despair to\r\ncountless people will always be a scar on our\r\nindividual and collective memory. Surely, failure to\r\nbring to justice those guilty of that crime, and those\r\nwho follow the same path, would mean our collective\r\nsubmission to an endless reign of terror and to fearful\r\ndarkness.\r\nIt is the wish of the Government and the people\r\nof Bhutan that I should, once again, express our\r\nsolidarity with the Government and the people of the\r\nUnited States and convey our heartfelt sympathy to\r\nthose who have suffered the irreparable loss of their\r\nloved and dear ones. We admire the way in which the\r\npeople of this great nation have come together to rise to\r\nthe challenges that the tragic events have left in their\r\nwake. We pay tribute to the brave and the selfless who\r\nlaid down their own lives as they fought to save those\r\nof others. Our hearts and minds are with the city of\r\nNew York, which has not only been a gracious host to\r\nthe United Nations, but is unparalleled in its generosity\r\nin giving shelter, livelihood, hope and joy to people of\r\nall races and creeds. Indeed, it came as no surprise that\r\nthe scale of the tragedy made itself felt not only in the\r\ndevastatingly high number of victims, but in the fact\r\nthat people from more than 80 countries were counted\r\namong the dead.\r\nA small part of everyone died that day, for\r\nreasons that can never be explained or justified. Indeed,\r\nhuman society has been left to ponder its claim to\r\nbeing civilized.\r\nUntil the tragedy of 11 September, the threat of\r\nterrorism was not fully appreciated. Those who had not\r\nfelt its demonic wrath tolerated it as just another\r\nmanifestation of social or political discontent. The\r\ncurrent environment throughout the globalized world\r\nhas harshly and most cruelly removed such\r\nmisconceptions. People all over the world are losing\r\ntheir freedom, willingly or without choice, in a\r\nmultitude of ways. And there is a pervasive sense of\r\nfear. Freedom is a heavy price to pay for anything.\r\nCivilized society ought to provide more liberty, not be\r\ncowed into affording less.\r\nThe disease that is the cause must be stamped out.\r\nA determined and coordinated approach by all\r\ncountries is the indispensable key. To this end, the\r\nUnited Nations must play the central role. It must\r\ninspire, unite and act. It must be behind all individual\r\ncountry, group and global efforts. In this context, the\r\nimportant initiative taken by the Security Council in\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) is to be welcomed. However,\r\nwe must remember that its impact will be determined\r\nnot so much by the letter as by the spirit with which it\r\nis accepted and implemented by all Member States.\r\nFor its part, Bhutan will make every effort to\r\nfulfil its duty as a Member State and a nation that is\r\nfully committed to the eradication of terrorism. Today,\r\nI signed the International Convention for the\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, and in due\r\ncourse our legislature will clear the way for accession\r\nto the other conventions relating to international\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe reign of terrorists in Afghanistan is coming\r\nto an end. It is our hope that the healing of the deep\r\nand painful wounds suffered interminably by the\r\nhelpless and innocent victims will begin immediately.\r\nWe also hope that, in the coming years, they will be\r\nable to find the environment of peace and security that\r\nhas eluded them for too long. Unfortunately, the period\r\nof renewal and reconstruction at the individual,\r\ncommunity and national levels will be long and\r\narduous for a country that has been reduced to rubble\r\nby war and its ravaging companions. We appeal to the\r\ninternational community to give sustained support to\r\nAfghanistan in a way that is sympathetic and\r\nresponsive to its immediate and long-term needs, while\r\nrespecting fully the dignity of its proud people.\r\nEven as we call for sustained and adequate\r\nassistance to Afghanistan, we must acknowledge that\r\nthe world is still reeling from the aftershocks of the\r\nattacks of 11 September. The cumulative impact on a\r\nworld economy that was already following a downward\r\ntrend has yet to be seen. There are other disturbing\r\nuncertainties. Clearly, there is a need to better define\r\nand understand the scope and limits of the war on\r\nterrorism so that the fears of the broader clash that is\r\nbeing spoken of are calmed. How do we create a\r\nclimate that can prevent the further diversion of\r\nresources to defence? Will the onslaught be protracted\r\nand consumptive in terms of our combined energy and\r\nresources? Amid such doubts and concerns, it is natural\r\nthat we should worry about how the international\r\ncommunity might be able to deliver on the hopes that\r\nwere raised by the Millennium Declaration a year ago.\r\nOur capacity to fight HIV/AIDS and poverty becomes\r\nquestionable, especially within the time frame we have\r\nset for ourselves.\r\nAgainst such a backdrop, the growing challenge\r\nwill be how to share and give in difficult times. How\r\ndoes one give beyond the bounds of disposable\r\nsurplus? As the representative of a developing country,\r\nI say this without wishing to undermine the greater\r\nimportance of raising domestic revenues and devoting\r\nthem to meeting the targets set. In this context, the\r\ndefining moment will be offered at the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nnext year in Mexico.\r\nNow more than ever it is necessary to reform the\r\nSecurity Council. We cannot continue to procrastinate\r\non this vital issue. The Council has to be a truly\r\nrepresentative body if it is to be relevant, respected and\r\neffective. That is not possible when vast continents and\r\nsignificant populations in the world are left out of\r\ncrucial decision-making processes on international\r\npeace and security. Without fair representation, the\r\nCouncil will risk emasculation — faltering on making\r\ndecisions that are implemented feebly.\r\nThe serious humanitarian, political and economic\r\nconsequences of the terrorist acts demand unity of\r\nthought and action on the part of all nations. Terrorism\r\nmust be rooted out. Yet, as in the conduct of our\r\neveryday life, there is a need for balance and\r\nmoderation. Just as the reasons for soul-searching and\r\ndoubt in ourselves as civilized beings are compelling, it\r\nis my earnest hope that the success of this session will\r\nbe marked by the profundity of collective wisdom and\r\ncommitment to restore lasting security, peace and\r\nnormality.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ravan Farhâdi, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Farhâdi (Afghanistan): At the outset, on\r\nbehalf of the Government of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan, and on my own behalf, I wish to express\r\nmy profound condolences to the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America and the American nation, as\r\nwell as the families that lost their loved ones in the\r\nunfortunate crash of American Airlines flight 857\r\nyesterday.\r\nMy delegation is very much delighted at Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo’s assumption of the presidency of the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly and remains\r\nassured that his able conduct will lead the work of this\r\nsession to its desired end.\r\nMy delegation is also very pleased at Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan’s meritorious winning of the\r\nNoble Peace Prize this year, I wish to warmly\r\ncongratulate him and his fellow recipient of the prize,\r\nthe United Nations itself.\r\nI am very thankful to all delegations that have\r\nmentioned the name and the case of Afghanistan and\r\nthe need for international help to reach Afghanistan.\r\nThe appalling events of 11 September and the\r\nsomewhat lesser-known event of 9 September — the\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nassassination by suicidal killers of the great Afghan\r\nleader Ahmad Shah Massoud — have changed the\r\nworld. The United Nations, the international\r\ncommunity and the world at large are focusing on a\r\nnew war, the war on terrorism. My Government and the\r\npeople of Afghanistan denounced the terrorist attacks\r\nagainst the United States and continue to denounce\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We\r\nourselves have been captives and hostages of terrorism\r\nlonger than most. In fact, during 23 years of war in\r\nAfghanistan, Muslim Afghans have not engaged in any\r\nterrorist acts. Islam is an integral part of life in\r\nAfghanistan and teaches justice and respect for human\r\nlife and glorifies the dignity of human beings.\r\nI quote from the Holy Koran: “We have bestowed\r\ndignity on the children of Adam”. (The Holy Koran,\r\nXVII:70)\r\nIslam, in the tradition of the Abrahamic faiths,\r\nplaces great emphasis on peace, compassion and the\r\nvalue of human life. Thus, Islam should be recognized\r\nfor the principles upon which it was created and not\r\nacts resulting from irresponsible interpretations, which\r\nare far from genuine Islam. These irresponsible\r\ninterpretations are based on primitive and sectarian\r\nthinking, especially the retrogressive policies against\r\nwomen, which have no place in Islam.\r\nWith the strong, broad global coalition on their\r\nside, today the people of Afghanistan have been\r\nvindicated in their righteous struggle against terrorism\r\nand extremism — a struggle pursued single-handedly\r\nbut valiantly over the past seven years against the\r\nterrorist forces of the Taliban mercenaries and their\r\ncross-border and international allies, chief among them\r\nsince 1996 being Osama bin Laden’s Al Qaeda terrorist\r\norganization.\r\nIn this most trying time, when the people of\r\nAfghanistan are being liberated from the rule of the\r\nTaliban, and when Taliban forces are fleeing strategic\r\ncities across our land, including the capital, Kabul, it is\r\nevident that the civilian inhabitants of these cities and\r\nthe people of Afghanistan as a whole, having offered\r\ntheir support to the liberating forces of the Islamic\r\nState of Afghanistan’s United Front, are deserving in\r\nthe fullest measure of a Government to which their\r\nwelfare can be soundly entrusted.\r\nOn Tuesday, 13 November, in a series of events\r\nrapidly taking shape in and around Kabul, the Taliban\r\nmercenaries and their terrorist allies were thought to be\r\nholding ground, but abandoned the city in a hasty\r\nmanner, causing a power vacuum.\r\nWith the capital, Kabul, on the verge of chaos and\r\nmayhem, the Government forces were left with no\r\noption but to dispatch a limited police force to the city.\r\nThe decision to police the city preceded eyewitness\r\nreports of the looting of National Bank assets and the\r\nplundering of the city’s main currency market and a\r\nnumber of aid agencies by the retreating Taliban forces.\r\nWe deeply regret any ill treatment of individuals\r\nthat may have occurred in isolated cases. We have\r\nordered our security authorities not only to refrain from\r\nbut to actively investigate any such acts that may have\r\nbeen committed and to prevent such incidents from\r\ntaking place in the future. Let me reiterate that our\r\ndesire for peace for all people in our land remains firm\r\nand that we will not, now or later, condone any lawless\r\nacts aimed at disrupting the crucial process of\r\ninstituting a broad-based, multi-ethnic and fully\r\nrepresentative Government in Afghanistan, as called\r\nfor by the United Nations and the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan hails the new\r\ndevelopments as a victory not only for the people of\r\nAfghanistan but also for the international community in\r\nour shared campaign against terrorism.\r\nLet me assure the Assembly that the recent\r\ngaining of ground by the forces of the Islamic State of\r\nAfghanistan’s United Front in Kabul in no way reflects\r\nan intention on the part of the Government of the\r\nIslamic State of Afghanistan to monopolize power.\r\nRather, it is our sincere hope that the people of\r\nAfghanistan will decide democratically in the near\r\nfuture what form of political system they desire. In this\r\ncontext, we steadfastly support United Nations\r\nresolutions on Afghanistan, and thereby the\r\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General’s\r\nspecial envoys to Afghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi and Ambassador Francesc Vendrell, and will\r\ndo our utmost for the implementation of the process.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan fully honours its\r\nagreement made in Rome with the representatives of\r\nthe Rome process, led by the former King of\r\nAfghanistan, Mohammed Zahir Shah, and remains\r\ncommitted to its implementation.\r\nToday Afghanistan finds itself in a major\r\nhumanitarian crisis — a crisis such as the world has not\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nwitnessed in recent times. With winter approaching our\r\npeople are facing famine. Our people will die because\r\nthey do not have enough food to sustain them through\r\nthe winter. Many aid agencies began leaving\r\nAfghanistan after it became evident that the bombing\r\ncampaign would begin.\r\nOver the past several years, tens of thousands of\r\ncivilians have either fled the country or have been\r\ninternally displaced. The people of Afghanistan are not\r\nasking for a favour. They desire first and foremost to\r\nreturn to the position they were in before 1978 — a\r\nlevel playing field where they can govern themselves\r\nand grow. Twenty million landmines, a ruined and\r\nalmost non-existent infrastructure and a very high\r\nilliteracy rate do not make for a level playing field.\r\nEven a fraction of the benefits bestowed on the\r\ninternational community by Afghan sacrifices can\r\nreconstruct our nation.\r\nToday we are charged with finding a solution for\r\nAfghanistan, even as problems continue to increase and\r\nchange on a day-to-day basis. But we must now, not\r\nlater, think about the people of Afghanistan and about\r\ngiving them peace after so many years of war.\r\nA broad-based Government, inter alia, through\r\nthe Loya Jirga — Grand Assembly — must be\r\nestablished. All ethnic groups must be equitably and\r\nadequately represented and given voice in this broad-\r\nbased Government. The Hazaras, Pashtuns, Tajiks,\r\nUzbeks, Aimaks, Turkmen, Baluchis and all other\r\nethnic groups of Afghanistan must have fair\r\nrepresentation in this broad-based Government.\r\nAll these groups make up what Afghanistan is\r\ntoday, and Afghanistan is not complete without any of\r\nthese groups. For centuries, all of these groups have\r\nlived peacefully among themselves without bloodshed,\r\nand each one has contributed to Afghanistan and has\r\nsacrificed tremendously in the resistance against\r\nrepeated foreign occupations. For centuries, all these\r\ngroups, as a united people, resisted foreign hegemonic\r\nforces. History has shown that Afghanistan is not for\r\nforeign occupation or conquest.\r\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan’s United Front\r\nwants the rule of law based on Islamic tenets,\r\npluralistic democracy, fundamental human rights,\r\npeace, unification and meaningful reconstruction. At\r\nour core we wish to uphold human rights for all\r\npeoples of our land — men and women. We desire to\r\nabide by United Nations resolutions, the rule of law\r\nand recognized international norms and principles. We\r\nhighly appreciate the efforts being made by the United\r\nNations aimed at finding a solution for Afghanistan\r\nand support all United Nations endeavours and\r\nmeasures to combat international terrorism.\r\nThe future Government of Afghanistan must not\r\nbe subjected any more to the unilateralism that has\r\nblanketed it for so long. The nation of Afghanistan\r\nmust have, as any nation must have, the respect of and\r\nsincere cooperation with its neighbours. The future\r\nGovernment of Afghanistan must not be reduced to a\r\n“sphere of influence”; it must be recognized as a\r\nsovereign nation in the truest sense. Self-determination\r\nfor Afghanistan means that no country of the world\r\nshould have a veto concerning what the Afghans decide\r\nfor themselves.\r\nRecognition of the principles of mutual respect,\r\nnon-interference and full sovereignty of Afghanistan\r\nwill naturally be followed by economic and\r\ncommercial cooperation. Hence, a sovereign\r\nAfghanistan will deploy all efforts to broaden its\r\nrelations with all of its neighbours, including Pakistan.\r\nSuch measures as opening up to Pakistan and opening\r\nup key transit routes, from north to south and from east\r\nto west, ought to be implemented. Afghanistan has to\r\nbroaden its economic relations with all neighbouring\r\ncountries. The crossroads at the heart of Asia is\r\nsituated in Afghanistan, and our country’s economic\r\nand international development rests largely in utilizing\r\nthis resource in a progressive and open manner.\r\nI need not remind Members today that a stable\r\nAfghanistan means a stable Pakistan and a stable\r\nCentral Asia. An ignored and ruined Afghanistan\r\nwould be a calamity for the entire region and the whole\r\nworld.\r\nThe people of Afghanistan must decide what\r\nform of Government they desire. No one ethnic group\r\nmust dominate and no neighbour of Afghanistan has\r\nthe right to incite, overtly or covertly, one ethnic group\r\nagainst others. It is time for the people of Afghanistan\r\nto think about their future and to come together. They\r\nmust all work together for their country as they have\r\nworked for centuries before. It is my aspiration and the\r\naspiration of every Afghan that normalcy will be\r\nrestored and that we will live in peace.\r\nWe, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and we, the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community, have\r\na duty to rebuild Afghanistan. There must be an\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nextensive and comprehensive United Nations-led\r\nreconstruction plan for Afghanistan. The international\r\ncommunity must take the reconstruction of Afghanistan\r\nas seriously as it takes the war on terrorism. I submit\r\nthat reconstruction and a people’s hope will do more to\r\neradicate evils such as terrorism and the seeds of\r\nterrorism than war can perhaps ever do.\r\nRehabilitation must begin with addressing\r\nhumanitarian problems, including the pressing crisis of\r\ninternally displaced persons and refugees. The longer-\r\nterm Afghan reconstruction programme must be\r\ncomprehensive; under such a programme, facilities of\r\nall kinds — roads, bridges, hospitals and schools and\r\nuniversities for boys and girls — must be\r\nreconstructed. Girls were purposely made illiterate by\r\nthe Taliban mercenaries. A massive education effort\r\nmust be undertaken so that our young people can learn\r\nskills and grow up to be a new generation for our\r\ncountry. The 20 million landmines must be cleared so\r\nthat the people can cultivate their land and not have to\r\nrely only on poppies to make a living.\r\nIn the Afghan reconstruction programme there\r\nmust be a programme for orphans and widows. The\r\nAfghan reconstruction programme must directly help\r\nthe war-stricken and war-devastated land and people of\r\nAfghanistan. Afghans of the diaspora, from all over the\r\nworld, must come and take part in the Afghan\r\nreconstruction programme and help build their country.\r\nI believe that, with the help of almighty God, we\r\ncan rebuild Afghanistan and that Afghanistan can once\r\nagain live in peace with its neighbours and can\r\ncontribute to the prosperity of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn conclusion, I appeal to the United Nations and\r\nto the international community to adopt a new vision\r\nfor Afghanistan, a vision that will leave behind the\r\ndeath and destruction that has seized its people for so\r\nmany years, a vision that embraces tolerance and unity,\r\na vision that will rebuild the spirit of Afghanistan and\r\ngive hope for peace to each and every person of our\r\nland. The change must come from each person who\r\ncalls himself a Muslim and an Afghan; it must also\r\ncome from each country that calls itself a friend of\r\nAfghanistan. Our friends and neighbours must grant us\r\nthe goodwill to govern ourselves and to be our own\r\npeople.\r\nThe Acting President: I can only wish the best\r\nfor the representative of Afghanistan, for his people\r\nand for his country at this very critical moment in\r\nworld history.\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Ahmed Abdi Hashi, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nSomalia.\r\nMr. Hashi (Somalia): I seize this opportunity to\r\nextend, on behalf of my Government, my warm\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. I am confident that, with his experience and\r\nprofound dedication, he will successfully guide the\r\nproceedings of this session. I also avail myself of this\r\nopportunity to thank his predecessor, His Excellency\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for his excellent stewardship of the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly. May I also\r\nextend our warmest congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, on his\r\nelection to a second term and on the award of the\r\nNobel Peace Prize to him and to the United Nations.\r\nLast year, at the Millennium Summit held here in\r\nNew York, the President of Somalia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdikassim Salad Hassan, stood before the\r\nAssembly after Somalia’s absence from the\r\ninternational arena for about a decade. That was a\r\nmoment of historic significance for my country, which\r\ncontinues to strive to emerge from the abyss of conflict\r\nand to reassert its position as an active Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. I reiterate our deep gratitude to the\r\ninternational community for welcoming us back into\r\nthe fold.\r\nIn the last century, humanity witnessed great and\r\nlaudable achievements in the political, scientific,\r\ntechnological and economic fields. Yet, despite those\r\naccomplishments, we continue to face challenges that\r\nneed to be fully addressed. Conflicts are abundant;\r\npoverty is rampant; the economic divide between North\r\nand South continues to widen; and the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS remains unabated in the world. Nations\r\naround the globe are reeling from the attendant\r\nconsequences and call for urgent and immediate action.\r\nThe events of 11 September shocked the\r\nconscience of all decent human beings. We in Somalia\r\nrelate to the pain and suffering of the people of the\r\nUnited States in a very profound and special way. The\r\nSomali people have been subjected to a reign of terror\r\nperpetrated by the warlords. We in Somalia, therefore,\r\nknow very well what it means to lose loved ones. Let\r\nme say that those who committed the heinous and\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\natrocious crimes of 11 September have nothing in\r\ncommon with Islam or with the Islamic faith. Islam\r\npreaches peace within one’s spiritual self and with\r\none’s neighbours; it preaches tolerance and\r\ncompassion.\r\nAllow me to reiterate our heartfelt and sincere\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims and to the\r\npeople and the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica on their tragic loss. We continue to share their\r\ngrief and pain.\r\nThe inhuman terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nbrought to the forefront new challenges to international\r\npeace and security. Our fight against terrorism must be\r\nbased on collective action by the international\r\ncommunity and on the principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. The immediate and\r\nstrong response by the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, including the adoption of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), reflects our collective\r\napproach in the fight against terrorism. The\r\nGovernment of Somalia fully supports Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and is firmly\r\ncommitted to translate its provisions into action.\r\nHaving said that, I must observe that terrorists\r\nwill exploit situations of injustice and imbalance as\r\nwell as conflicts in fragile and unstable States. The\r\ninternational community is under a moral obligation to\r\ncome to the aid of those States in the form of post-\r\nconflict peace-building and national reconstruction so\r\nthat they do not become vulnerable to the evil forces of\r\nterrorism. In that context, we welcome the statement\r\nmade before the Assembly by His Excellency President\r\nGeorge W. Bush, in which he expressed the readiness\r\nof the United States Government to extend assistance\r\nto those countries that lack adequate resources to\r\ncombat terrorism. A case in point is the situation in my\r\ncountry, where there was a political vacuum and no\r\nGovernment for a decade.\r\nMr. Gounaris (Greece), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe present Somali Government has been in\r\noffice for about a year and a few months. It is a\r\nGovernment that inherited destroyed institutions and\r\ndevastated infrastructure. There are two options before\r\nthe international community in dealing with the\r\nsituation in Somalia: watch the country slide back into\r\nanarchy and chaos or fully support the struggling\r\nSomali State by providing the necessary resources to\r\nenable it to play a meaningful role in the fight against\r\nterrorism. The Somali Government needs urgent and\r\nadequate assistance from the international community\r\nto be able to comply with resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nLet me at this juncture address the persistent\r\nreports in the media and elsewhere alleging, among\r\nother things, the existence of terrorist camps in\r\nSomalia. First, I should firmly state that the Somali\r\nGovernment hosts no terrorists nor does it offer bases\r\nor training camps for them. My Government has not\r\noffered and will not offer them any sanctuary. We will\r\narrest and hand over immediately any known terrorist\r\nwho comes to our shores. Secondly, we want to\r\nchallenge the veracity of these reports. It is also\r\nimportant to evaluate objectively the integrity of the\r\nsources of this kind of information.\r\nWe are a transparent and open society and are\r\nmore than willing to cooperate fully with the United\r\nNations and with States in this regard. The Somali\r\nGovernment is ready to invite the media and other\r\ninterested parties to visit our country to verify the facts\r\non the ground. First, we need to see the evidence and\r\nestablish the facts first. It is a fundamental principle of\r\nlaw and natural justice that every person is presumed\r\ninnocent until proven guilty. This principle, in our\r\nopinion, is equally applicable to States.\r\nIn view of my Government’s serious concern\r\nabout these accusations, we propose setting up an\r\ninternational committee of inquiry under the auspices\r\nof the United Nations Security Council to investigate\r\nthese allegations. We also propose that the committee\r\nidentify Somalia’s needs in regard to the\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001). We are fully prepared to cooperate with the\r\nproposed committee, if established, in the fulfilment of\r\nits mandate.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Somali Government\r\nhas been in office for approximately a year and three\r\nmonths. During this time, the Government has faced\r\ndaunting challenges, primarily in enhancing security in\r\nthe capital and others areas. We have succeeded in\r\ndemobilizing 25,000 militia personnel. We have\r\nestablished police stations and deployed 3,000 police\r\nofficers in the capital. A judiciary system has been put\r\nin place, courts are functioning, and the Government is\r\ncollecting taxes for the first time in a decade.\r\nThe Somali Government continues to search for a\r\nlasting peace in Somalia through dialogue with those\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\noutside the Arta process. This is in conformity with the\r\nTransitional National Charter and resolutions adopted\r\nby regional, subregional and international\r\norganizations, as well as the presidential statements of\r\nthe Security Council on Somalia.\r\nIn this regard, let me also refer to the numerous\r\nimportant initiatives that have been launched to\r\npromote national reconciliation and peace in Somalia.\r\nWe extend our profound thanks and appreciation to all\r\nthose countries that have contributed to the search for\r\npeace in Somalia.\r\nLet me, in this regard, pay special tribute to\r\nPresident of the Republic of Djibouti, Mr. Ismail Omar\r\nGuelleh, and Government of Djibouti for their\r\nsignificant, continuous and positive contribution to the\r\nnational reconciliation process. I would also like to\r\nthank Mr. Omer Al-Bashir, President of the Sudan and\r\nthe current chairman of the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), for his consistent\r\nsupport for Somalia and the search for a lasting peace\r\nin my country. The United Nations, the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity, the League of Arab States and IGAD\r\ncontinue to play a positive role in this regard, for which\r\nwe thank them.\r\nFinally, I want to express, on behalf of my\r\nPresident, our thanks to President Daniel arap Moi for\r\nhis recent efforts in bringing peace to Somalia.\r\nPresident Moi’s latest initiative was the recent meeting\r\nheld in Nairobi last month. The meeting brought\r\ntogether the President of Somalia and some of the\r\nopposition groups. A joint communiqué was signed,\r\nstipulating the principles upon which future talks could\r\nbe based. We expect a broader-based meeting to be\r\nheld soon.\r\nIn conclusion, let me once again emphasize that\r\nSomalia is a struggling country working toward\r\nachieving peace. This country needs massive assistance\r\nfor the reconstruction and rehabilitation of its\r\ninfrastructure and institutions. We urgently need the\r\nassistance and goodwill of the international\r\ncommunity. It is my sincere hope that the international\r\ncommunity will respond positively and in a timely\r\nmanner to our appeal for urgent and immediate\r\nassistance.\r\nThe Acting President: We have just heard the\r\nlast speaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nTwo representatives have requested the floor to\r\nexercise the right of reply. May I remind Members that\r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nI call on the representative of Turkey.\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey): Today, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia, Mr. Vartan\r\nOskanian, deploring once again the absence of\r\ndiplomatic relations with neighbouring Turkey, called\r\non Turkey to join in a dialogue, while claiming that\r\nArmenia is not willing to permit its tragic past to\r\ndefine its actions in the future.\r\nUnfortunately, what Mr. Oskanian implied today\r\ntells us otherwise. Armenia is still willing to usurp an\r\nindeed tragic past. Yet the last thing we at this\r\nAssembly needed today was the fomenting of hatred.\r\nWhile we do not negate the suffering nor forget the\r\ntragedy that befell all the peoples of Anatolia and the\r\nCaucasus, we deplore the language Mr. Oskanian chose\r\nto employ today. Armenia is haunted by a distorted\r\nversion of history reflected in its founding documents.\r\nIt continues to occupy Nagorny-Karabakh and other\r\nAzerbaijani territory.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAt any rate, Mr. Oskanian’s judgements on\r\nTurkey are based on falsifications of history. They\r\nrefuse to this day to see our suffering and fail to\r\nacknowledge the responsibility of the senseless radical\r\nand revolutionary Armenian leadership of the day for\r\nthe tragic events which took place. The Armenian\r\nGovernment knows very well the requirements of an\r\nhonest dialogue and improved relations. Today those\r\nelements were absent in the statement made by\r\nMr. Oskanian.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Armenia.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): The issue of the\r\nArmenian genocide is not something that needs to be\r\nproven. When 2 million people suddenly, in a matter of\r\nweeks, disappear from their historic homeland of 3,000\r\nyears, that can only be the result of a planned and well-\r\nexecuted genocide. When hundreds of Armenian\r\nintellectuals living in Istanbul, including the Armenian\r\nmembers of the Turkish Parliament, are executed\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nwithout trial in one day, that can only be the result of\r\ngenocide. This is absolutely clear. It is clear not only to\r\nus but also to a large number of States that have\r\nofficially recognized and condemned the crime of\r\ngenocide committed against the Armenian people.\r\nThere is one piece of evidence in favour of our\r\nposition that is more than relevant in the United\r\nNations, and these are the words of Raphael Lemkin,\r\nthe coiner of the term “genocide” and one of the\r\nauthors of the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide. He once said\r\nthat the international community needed that\r\nConvention in order to prevent a recurrence of what\r\nhappened to the Armenians during the World War I and\r\nto Jews during the World War II.\r\nAs for the issue of occupying other countries’\r\nterritories, we believe that the country which itself has\r\ncommitted the crime of aggression and still occupies\r\nnearly half of Cyprus has no right to use the turn\r\n“occupation” in the United Nations or to use it when\r\nspeaking about other countries.\r\nTurkey has been using the issue of the Armenian\r\ngenocide to sabotage all our efforts to normalize our\r\nrelations with Turkey and to establish good-\r\nneighbourly relations between our peoples. Just an\r\nhour ago my Foreign Minister repeated his call and\r\nconfirmed our readiness to engage in a constructive\r\ndialogue with Turkey without any preconditions. We\r\nhope that this time these calls will not go unanswered.\r\nThe Acting President: Turkey has again asked to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. The second\r\nintervention, according to the rules, should be limited\r\nto five minutes.\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey): I understand; we can go\r\nalong these lines with my Armenian colleague, but I\r\nwill restrain myself to what Professor Bernard Lewis\r\nwrote in Ha’aretz on 23 January 1998,\r\n“The Armenians want to benefit from both\r\nworlds. On the one hand, they speak with pride of\r\ntheir struggle against Ottoman despotism, while\r\non the other hand they compare their tragedy with\r\nthe Jewish holocaust.”\r\nThat is exactly what is taking place right now.\r\nMr. Boghos-Nubar, a prominent Armenian leader,\r\nhimself said that during World War One Armenians had\r\nbeen, since the beginning of the war, de facto\r\nbelligerents. Continuing, he said that they fought\r\nalongside the Allies on all fronts.\r\nWhat I would like to underline here is that Turkey\r\nhas never denied the suffering of the gifted Armenian\r\nrace, but the Armenians want us to honour only their\r\ndead, while we say that the deaths of both Armenians\r\nand Turks, and of other people, should be honoured. I\r\nwill limit myself to this.\r\nThe Acting President: Armenia has again asked\r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I would like only to\r\ndraw the attention of my Turkish colleague to the fact\r\nthat it is not the Armenian side that made the\r\ncomparison between the Armenian genocide and the\r\nJewish holocaust. As far as I can remember, I was\r\nquoting Mr. Raphael Lemkin, the coiner of the term\r\n“genocide”, who was a well-recognized authority on\r\nthe issue. As for the suffering of the Turkish side, I\r\nthink there can be absolutely no comparison between\r\nthe suffering of the executioner and his victims.\r\nThe Acting President: I now see that Cyprus has\r\nasked to exercise its right of reply.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): At the outset, Sir, let\r\nme say that I am very happy that you are presiding over\r\nthis Assembly. I could not sit by and listen to my\r\ncountry’s name being mentioned as a victim of\r\noccupation and not take the floor. It is indeed\r\noccupation. General Assembly resolution 37/253 was\r\nadopted in this very Hall. This resolution calls for the\r\nwithdrawal of the occupation troops from the Republic\r\nof Cyprus and calls on all Member States to respect the\r\nsovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and\r\nunity of Cyprus. It also calls upon all Member States to\r\nhelp the Republic of Cyprus so that it may exercise its\r\nsovereign right over the whole territory of the\r\nRepublic.\r\nOf course, Turkey has not done that. What is\r\nworse is that Turkey itself voted for General Assembly\r\nresolution 3212 (XXIX). This very resolution was\r\nendorsed by Security Council 365 (1974), which called\r\nfor the withdrawal of foreign troops. With the audacity\r\nthat characterizes Turkey, Turkish troops are still in\r\nCyprus.\r\nThe Acting President: I am informed that,\r\naccording to the rules of procedure, the delegation of\r\nArmenia has already made two replies. There are no\r\nmore possibilities.\r\n39\r\nA/56/PV.53\r\nI call on the representative of Armenia on a point\r\nof order.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): According to the rules\r\nof procedure a delegation can exercise its right of reply\r\ntwice. My delegation had earlier requested the floor to\r\nexercise its right of reply with regard to the statement\r\nof another delegation, that of the Foreign Minister of\r\nAzerbaijan, which has nothing to do with the debate\r\nthat was just under way between the Armenian and\r\nTurkish delegations. So, I would like to request the\r\nfloor to exercise my right of reply to the statement of\r\nthe Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan. With your\r\npermission, I will continue.\r\nThe Acting President: The rules of procedure\r\nsay that the number of interventions in exercise of the\r\nright of reply for any delegation at a given meeting\r\nshould be limited to two per item. I am a new\r\nPresident, as you know, so I will have to be guided\r\nhere. We will pause for a minute.\r\nI have now been guided by my very good\r\ncolleagues. When we refer to “item” here, we are\r\ntalking about the general debate. Therefore, you have\r\nexhausted the two times you can take the floor today.\r\nHowever, I am informed that you can take the floor\r\ntomorrow if you wish.\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat, as announced in the Journal today, on Thursday,\r\n15 November 2001, at 8.30 a.m., the General\r\nCommittee will meet in Conference Room 4 to\r\nconsider a request by India, which has been circulated\r\nin document A/56/614.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.\r\n"
