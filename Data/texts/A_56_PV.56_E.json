(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda of the fifty-sixth regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly, organization of\r\nwork and allocation of items\r\nFourth report of the General Committee\r\n(A/56/250/Add.3)\r\nThe President: In its report, the General\r\nCommittee decided to recommend to the General\r\nAssembly that sub-item (f) of agenda item 21,\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”, also be allocated to the\r\nSixth Committee, for the sole purpose of considering\r\nthe question of the granting of observer status to the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union in the General Assembly.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto also allocate to the Sixth Committee sub-item (f) of\r\nagenda item 21, “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union”, for the\r\nsole purpose of considering the question of the granting\r\nof observer status to the Inter-Parliamentary Union in\r\nthe General Assembly?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Philippe Antonio, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Haiti.\r\nMr. Antonio (Haiti) (spoke in French): On behalf\r\nof the President of the Republic of Haiti and of the\r\nHaitian delegation, I should like at the outset to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. You may rest assured of the full support of the\r\nHaitian delegation as you carry out your functions.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, on the efficacy and\r\ntalent he displayed in conducting the work of the\r\nMillennium Assembly.\r\nAllow me furthermore to offer my warmest\r\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and\r\nto the Organization on their receiving the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize. Above and beyond any other consideration, this\r\nreflects recognition of the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Organization to promote peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI also take this opportunity to convey, on behalf\r\nof the people and Government of Haiti, our sincere\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families, and in particular\r\nto the Government and brotherly people of the\r\nDominican Republic, following the tragic aeroplane\r\naccident in Queens, New York, on 12 November.\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Haiti firmly\r\ncondemns the hateful acts carried out on 11 September\r\nin Manhattan, New York, Washington, D.C., and\r\nPennsylvania, which claimed thousands of victims. On\r\nthis occasion, the Government offers its solidarity to\r\nthe American people and Government and its support\r\nin the fight against terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations, wherever it may occur and whomever\r\nits perpetrators, victims and promoters may be. These\r\ninhuman and blind acts, while eliciting grief and\r\ndespair, attack the very underpinnings of the\r\ndemocratic system and do violence to international\r\npeace and security, freedom, human rights and the\r\nsearch for well-being and prosperity.\r\nThe international community already has at its\r\ndisposal 10 conventions, complemented by two\r\nprotocols, addressing terrorism in its various\r\nmanifestations, not to mention two additional\r\ninitiatives under consideration on the issue. The\r\ninternational legal instruments were recently\r\nstrengthened by Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), which provides the major guidelines for our\r\ncommon struggle. We all stand to gain by adhering to\r\ninternational legality. In that vein, the Haitian\r\nGovernment, notwithstanding its meagre resources, is\r\ncommitted to taking the measures necessary to ratify\r\nand implement these relevant legal instruments.\r\nThese legal instruments are indispensable to our\r\ncommon struggle against this scourge, to be sure, but it\r\nis also of the utmost importance that we begin to\r\nconsider the social, economic, political and other\r\nfactors that might spawn terrorism. The international\r\ncommunity, under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nand the banner of tolerance and solidarity, must build a\r\ngrand coalition against poverty, ignorance, want,\r\nhunger, social exclusion and marginalization. That task\r\nis more urgent now than ever.\r\nIt is time for the members of the international\r\ncommunity to reach a consensus on Security Council\r\nreform. It is necessary to increase the number of the\r\nCouncil’s permanent members on the basis of better\r\ngeographic distribution. We must undertake an in-depth\r\nre-evaluation of the right of veto, the current form of\r\nwhich is barely relevant to international relations and\r\nthe exigencies of the democratic imperative. We must\r\nalso institutionalize transparency in the Council’s\r\nworking methods and procedures. The achievement of\r\nthese goals will make the Organization more effective\r\nand strengthen its legitimacy and authority.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti urges States and peoples in\r\nconflict, especially in the Middle East, to embrace\r\ndialogue in order to find lasting peace.\r\nToday, in a world led by financial markets, trade\r\nexchanges and investments of unprecedented scope, a\r\nnumber of developing countries are being marginalized\r\nfrom world economic developments. We must\r\nrefashion cooperation for development if we wish to\r\nreverse their slide into marginalization and extreme\r\npoverty. We must, in partnership with the international\r\ncommunity and all the actors concerned, revise our\r\nstrategies and propose a common approach that will\r\ntackle the problem of inequality during the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThus, we are afforded the opportunity to\r\nimplement all the commitments undertaken by our\r\nheads of State and Government during the Millennium\r\nSummit. More than 147 heads of State and Government\r\nsolemnly committed themselves to deliver humanity\r\nfrom want, and to make the right to development a\r\nreality for all. It is incumbent on us to translate these\r\ncommitments into concrete deeds.\r\nThe benefits of trade for development are\r\nrecognized, but it is perhaps still necessary to ask\r\nourselves if in the context of globalization the least\r\ndeveloped countries do not find themselves in a\r\ndilemma. How can we seriously speak of free trade\r\nwith countries that, for the most part, have little to\r\ntrade. It is also necessary to increase their production\r\nand export capacities.\r\nIt is essential that these countries have access to\r\nmarkets where they can sell their products. There is the\r\n“Everything but arms” initiative of the European\r\nCommission, which we welcome, and we invite our\r\ndeveloping country partners to do the same.\r\nThe Haitian Government welcomes the holding of\r\nthe Conference on Financing for Development, which\r\nwill take place during the first quarter of 2002 in\r\nMonterrey, Mexico. That Conference gives us the\r\nopportunity to formulate recommendations on the\r\nreorientation of cooperation for development, in\r\nparticular concrete measures in the area of debt\r\nmanagement, technological cooperation, trade,\r\ninvestment and the international financial system. The\r\nHaitian Government also welcomes the organizing of\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development, which\r\nwill take place next September in Johannesburg, and\r\ninvites its partners to accept this concept of\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\npartnership, in which the interlocutors hold dialogues\r\nas equals in a framework of mutual respect.\r\nMy Government reaffirms its faith in a\r\ndemocratic future for Haiti, and, out of conviction, will\r\ndo everything necessary to consolidate and strengthen\r\nthe rule of law. Democracy will thus remain one of the\r\npillars of the Haitian Government’s policies.\r\nHaiti is now undergoing a crisis situation, which\r\nis the result of an electoral controversy. In fact, after\r\nthe elections of 21 May 2000 for the reconstitution of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies, more than two thirds of the\r\nSenate and all of our local offices, the electoral\r\nobserver mission of the Organization of American\r\nStates (OAS), while acknowledging in a report that the\r\nelections took place in an acceptable and credible way,\r\nstill uncovered certain irregularities in the way that the\r\nabsolute majority required for the election of the eight\r\ncandidates to the Senate had been calculated. What\r\nfollowed was the suspension of international\r\nassistance, the resumption of which is still conditional\r\non resolving the post-electoral crisis.\r\nAs soon as he was elected, and even before his\r\ninauguration, Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide\r\ncommitted himself to the path of dialogue, convinced\r\nthat opposition is necessary for the proper functioning\r\nof institutions. It was in this context that President\r\nAristide’s eight-point letter of December 2000 was sent\r\nto the then President of the United States, Mr. William\r\nJefferson Clinton. In fact, in his search for a negotiated\r\nsolution, President Aristide encouraged initiatives on\r\nthe part of sectors of civil society.\r\nIn addition, during the participation of the Haitian\r\ndelegation at the Quebec Summit, where the member\r\nStates of the OAS took note of the efforts made by the\r\nGovernment, our head of State reiterated once again his\r\ndetermination to find a negotiated solution to the crisis\r\nin Haiti.\r\nOnce again, in Costa Rica, during the twenty-first\r\nsession of the OAS General Assembly in June 2001,\r\nPresident Aristide, in a letter to the President of the\r\nAssembly made proposals that were incorporated into a\r\nresolution adopted by the 34 members of the\r\norganization as recommendations for crisis resolution.\r\nSince then, the head of State and the Government of\r\nHaiti have done everything possible to effectively\r\nimplement these recommendations.\r\nThe Haitian Government and the political\r\norganization Fanmi Lavalas, with a mediation role\r\nplayed the OAS general secretariat, have begun\r\nnegotiations with Democratic Convergence, a political\r\nopposition group, with a view to reaching an agreement\r\nin the framework of the commitments made in Costa\r\nRica.\r\nDuring those negotiations, various proposals have\r\nbeen put forward, particularly: the resignation of the\r\nseven senators concerned in the OAS report; the\r\nshortening by two years of the term of office of all\r\ndeputies; the shortening of the term of office of the\r\nsenators elected on 21 May 2000; the putting together\r\nof a future provisional electoral council; the holding in\r\nNovember 2002 of early elections for all of the\r\nmembers of parliament involved in the points that I\r\nhave just mentioned; and the holding of elections\r\nduring the first quarter of 2003 for the local offices\r\nwhose terms will expire in November 2003.\r\nPresident Aristide, the Government and the\r\nFanmi Lavalas party have demonstrated much\r\nflexibility in the framework of negotiations.\r\nUnfortunately, the Convergence remains intransigent\r\nand challenges the wording of the two last points, on\r\nthe holding of elections. The Convergence is frozen in\r\nits position, called “option zero”, which consists in\r\nsimply annulling the elections of 21 May 2000. Thus,\r\nthe impasse still exists; international assistance is still\r\nsuspended.\r\nMeanwhile, poverty rages in Haiti. The AIDS\r\npandemic, having claimed 260,000 victims, means a\r\nloss in terms of the life expectancy of our population,\r\nwhich had been painstakingly increased. Maternal and\r\ninfant mortality is clearly progressing. The figure of\r\n500 out of 100,000 dying in childbirth and the infant\r\nmortality rate, which has risen to 61 out of every 1,000\r\nbirths, remain very alarming. Given that children,\r\nwomen and men — an entire population — are dying\r\nfor lack of means, of financial resources, would it be an\r\nexaggeration to speak of another form of economic\r\nterrorism that none dare reveal?\r\nCan one justify the link between a contested\r\nmethod of tallying votes and the freeze on financing\r\ngiven to my country in the form of loans — loans on\r\nwhich we continue, despite everything, to pay\r\ninterest — especially since we know that the legislative\r\nand local elections of 21 May 2000 were held to fill\r\n7,500 vacant posts, that 29,000 candidates took part in\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nthese elections, and that voter participation of 60 per\r\ncent was the highest since 1990?\r\nThe Republic of Haiti remains confident of its\r\ndestiny. It appeals to the international community so\r\nthat its members will understand that the survival of\r\nthe people cannot be tied only to political manoeuvres.\r\nThe Haitian Government is committed to a process of\r\nstrengthening institutions and remains open to dialogue\r\nand all proposals that do not undermine the dignity of\r\nthe Haitian people. Against this background, we\r\nwelcome with satisfaction the letter of the Black\r\nCaucus of the United States Congress, of 9 November\r\n2001, addressed to the current President of the United\r\nStates, Mr. George W. Bush, which denounces the\r\ninflexible policies vis-à-vis Haiti that make economic\r\ncooperation dependent on unblocking the political\r\nprocess.\r\nThe Government is ready to do everything in its\r\npower to resolve the post-election crisis and put the\r\ncountry back on the path of development, but this\r\ncannot be done without the cooperation of the\r\ninternational community. To this end, it invites this\r\ncommunity to join it in its daily struggle for survival,\r\nreconciliation and peace.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Igor Ivanov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRussian Federation.\r\nMr. Ivanov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): This session of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place in the shadow of an unprecedented\r\nchallenge to humanity posed by international terrorism.\r\nWe all must seriously analyse how this could have\r\nhappened. However, it has already become perfectly\r\nclear today that the period of globalization and the\r\nthreats and challenges to international and regional\r\nsecurity that it brings with it make it urgent for of all of\r\nus to take fundamentally new approaches to\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nWe face a tough dilemma, whose solution will\r\ntruly be of paramount importance. Either we work\r\ntogether to responsibly construct a genuinely just and\r\ndemocratic world order that can guarantee equal\r\nsecurity and sustainable development for all States in\r\nthe world, or we show ourselves to be unable to\r\ncounter real threats to global stability and security.\r\nThe most important task of the international\r\ncommunity today is to create a global system to\r\ncounteract new threats and challenges, first and\r\nforemost among which is international terrorism. This\r\ntopic was the focus of negotiations between the\r\nPresident of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir V.\r\nPutin, and the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, Mr. George W. Bush, which recently took\r\nplace in Washington, D.C. and Crawford, Texas.\r\nA universal anti-terrorist coalition has been\r\nformed. The Russian Federation is a responsible\r\nparticipant in this coalition. The creation of this\r\ncoalition has involved the United Nations playing a\r\nvery important role in consolidating and coordinating\r\nactivities. It is precisely the United Nations that has the\r\nnecessary universal character and authority to organize\r\na response to the threats and challenges that confront\r\nmankind today.\r\nThe broad decisions taken by the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly create a solid\r\npolitical and legal framework for efforts to neutralize\r\nthe threat of terrorism. It is now important for these\r\ndecisions to be implemented by all States.\r\nIf necessary, the use of the most decisive means\r\nagainst terrorists may be permissible, including the use\r\nof military force. The Charter grants that right. At the\r\nsame time, this threat cannot be overcome by force\r\nalone. A comprehensive approach to eradicating\r\nterrorism would imply the use of the whole range of\r\npolitical, economic, financial and humanitarian\r\nmeasures.\r\nThe consolidation of the international legal\r\nframework for combating terrorism is now on our\r\nagenda. It is extremely important to rapidly complete\r\nand adopt the comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism and a convention for the\r\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\nIt would be of great importance to establish\r\nwithin the United Nations a mechanism to monitor the\r\nfulfilment by States of their treaty obligations\r\nconcerning the suppression of terrorism.\r\nWe consider promising the idea to establish,\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations, a centre for\r\ncoordinating assistance to States to resolve crises\r\ncaused by terrorist acts. Such a structure could focus on\r\nproviding consultative and material and technical\r\nsupport in managing the consequences of terrorist acts.\r\nThe Russian Federation also proposes studying\r\nthe possibility of including in international law the\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nprinciple of the responsibility of States for their failure\r\nto take measures against terrorists in their territory or\r\nunder their jurisdiction.\r\nOf key importance in the success of the\r\ncomprehensive fight against international terrorism is\r\nthe maintenance and strengthening of strategic stability\r\nat both global and regional levels and strengthening the\r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe focus of the international community should\r\ncontinue to be on the interdependence and merging of\r\ninternational terrorism, drug trafficking and\r\ntransnational organized crime. The Russian Federation\r\nfavours the rapid entry into force of the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism and the United Nations Convention Against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime and its additional\r\nprotocols.\r\nIt is perfectly clear that the fight against terrorism\r\nis not aimed at any particular religion, civilization or\r\nculture. This was clearly demonstrated by the\r\ndiscussions on the dialogue among civilizations during\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly. We also\r\nhope that a practical contribution in this area can be\r\nmade by the implementation of the initiative put\r\nforward by Islamic religious leaders from the Russian\r\nFederation to organize an international conference\r\nentitled “Islam against terrorism” in Moscow.\r\nTerrorism is rooted in the gap between affluence\r\nand poverty, both within States and in the international\r\narena. Thus, the task now, as never before, is to ensure\r\nsustainable development throughout the world and to\r\nensure that the social aspects of the globalization\r\nprocess are addressed.\r\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies\r\ncan do a lot to ensure effective rejection of extremism\r\nof all forms. We suggest that thought should be given\r\nto organizing, under the aegis of the United Nations, a\r\nworld forum that would discuss what contribution civil\r\nsociety and, particularly, the mass media could make to\r\ncombating terrorism.\r\nInternational experience has shown that\r\nsuccessful prevention and settlement of regional\r\nconflicts are an integral part of the counter-terrorist\r\nefforts of the international community. This is yet\r\nanother compelling argument in favour of further\r\ndeveloping and ensuring greater effectiveness of\r\nUnited Nations preventive and peacekeeping activities.\r\nIn particular, the Russian Federation advocates the\r\ndevelopment within the United Nations of a\r\ncomprehensive strategy aimed at reliably blocking\r\nchannels for outside fuelling of the conflicts.\r\nWe need to ensure that there is regional\r\ncooperation in fighting these new threats. An example\r\nof such successful cooperation is that of the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, under the\r\nauspices of which a CIS anti-terrorist centre has been\r\nset up and is working effectively.\r\nToday, the moment of truth has arrived for each\r\nof us. The Russian Federation is in favour of the\r\ninternational community taking decisions that can\r\nprovide for strategic stability and equal security for all\r\nStates, sustainable development and prosperity for all\r\nthe peoples of the planet and peace and tranquillity for\r\neach family and each individual.\r\nThese noble aims can only be achieved jointly, by\r\nworking cooperatively and uniting the efforts of the\r\nentire international community. The United Nations has\r\na vital role to play in this regard. Our Organization\r\nwas, and indeed remains, the most important\r\ninstrument available to the international community,\r\nwhose effective and responsible use will allow us to\r\ncreate a new democratic and just world order for the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Patrice Trovoada, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation and Community of Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe.\r\nMr. Trovoada (Sao Tome and Principe) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; interpretation from French text provided\r\nby the delegation): Mr. President, allow me to\r\ncongratulate you on behalf of the State of Sao Tome\r\nand myself on your election to the presidency of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, which\r\ntestifies to the international community’s esteem for\r\nand recognition of the Republic of Korea and you\r\npersonally. Please accept our wishes for every success\r\nas you carry out your mandate. Let me also express our\r\nthanks to your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for the\r\nexemplary way he led the work of our last session.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-General, both on his\r\nresounding re-election and on the well-deserved and\r\njust awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to him and the\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nUnited Nations, reflecting their major contributions to\r\nthe cause of peace and development.\r\nThis session is being held at a particularly\r\nimportant juncture in the history of international\r\nrelations, when the entire international community is\r\nmobilizing to confront the devastating phenomenon of\r\ninternational terrorism, the scope and magnitude of\r\nwhich were evident in the 11 September attacks on\r\nNew York and Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich took the lives of thousands of innocent people.\r\nAt that time, Sao Tome and Principe expressed its total\r\nindignation at the criminal and monstrous acts\r\ncommitted against the American people, as well as its\r\nfull solidarity with the American authorities and the\r\nfamilies of the victims. We share the opinion that those\r\nresponsible for these barbaric acts must be\r\napprehended and punished, and that terrorist\r\norganizations supporting them must be dismantled by\r\nall necessary means.\r\nWe reaffirm our full readiness to cooperate\r\nactively at both the regional and international levels in\r\nthe fight against terrorism, which is one of the major\r\nevils threatening world peace and security today. We\r\nhail all initiatives taken to contain the military action,\r\njustly launched against those who sow terror as well as\r\nthose who shelter them in their territories, so as to\r\navoid having innocent victims among the civilian\r\npopulation. We welcome the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to adopt a juridical instrument to make the\r\nfight against terrorism more effective in the context of\r\na global strategy.\r\nNo one can doubt that this act of criminal,\r\nunacceptable and unjustified aggression, condemned\r\nthroughout the world, requires a new dynamic in the\r\nfight against it, particularly within the United Nations.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that important measures have\r\nbeen taken in that regard, notably by the Security\r\nCouncil in resolution 1373 (2001), of 28 September.\r\nYet the manifestation of extreme violence in these\r\nrecent attacks alerts us to the need to understand in a\r\ndifferent and comprehensive way the great problems\r\nfaced by mankind throughout the world, without losing\r\nsight of the merciless fight that must be waged against\r\ninternational terrorism in all its manifestations.\r\nDespite the considerable scientific and\r\ntechnological progress recorded throughout history,\r\nwhich has permitted high levels of development,\r\nstriking imbalances persist in a number of areas with\r\nregard to social and economic development, both\r\nwithin and among the countries, regions and subregions\r\nof the world. Witness particularly the situation\r\nprevailing in sub-Saharan Africa. A look at the\r\nstatistics of economic and social conditions in the\r\ncountries of that region is enough to reveal the urgent\r\nneed to develop a front that, acting concertedly and\r\ncollectively, can fight to eradicate their absolute\r\npoverty.\r\nFaced with this scenario — rich countries on the\r\none hand and poor countries on the other — one might\r\nwonder whether the political will exists to reverse this\r\nsituation, which is dominated by selfishness and the\r\ninterests of individuals, groups and States. Only thus\r\ncan one explain the lack of cooperation, indifference\r\nand, indeed, the lack of sensitivity shown by the\r\nindustries of developed countries in the face of real\r\nscourges that devastate thousands of people, making\r\nthe countries of the South even more vulnerable. For\r\nexample, I am thinking of the HIV/AIDS pandemic as\r\nwell as other epidemics, such as hepatitis B and\r\nmalaria.\r\nThe efforts of international organizations —\r\nnotably the United Nations and its system, as well as\r\ncertain non-governmental organizations — to help\r\nmankind cope with this painful situation must be\r\nvisible.\r\nMoreover, beyond the economic data reflecting\r\nthe growth of poverty in Africa, the situation of our\r\ncontinent is worsened by the persistence of armed\r\nconflicts, particularly the crises in the Great Lakes\r\nregion, the Horn of Africa and Angola, to cite only a\r\nfew examples of the fratricidal war that afflicts us.\r\nAs to the situation in Angola, we reaffirm our\r\nurgent desire to see an end to the war in that fraternal\r\ncountry. We condemn the terrorist acts that have\r\nclaimed countless lives, particularly among the civilian\r\npopulation, and we call for a renewed application of\r\nthe terms of the Lusaka Protocol for conflict resolution.\r\nIn the context of conflict resolution, we welcome\r\nthe efforts of the international community to find a\r\nsolution to the East Timor question, as well as progress\r\nmade in the process of emancipation of the Maubere\r\npeople under the aegis of the United Nations. It is our\r\ngreat hope to see this brotherly people admitted to the\r\nUnited Nations as a full-fledged Member and to see a\r\nstrengthened Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nWe note with concern the escalation of violence\r\nin the Middle East. In our view, it is essential that\r\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority resume the\r\nnegotiations on the peace process, the only way to find\r\na just and peaceful solution that takes into account both\r\nthe right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\r\nand the guarantee of security for the State of Israel.\r\nUnfortunately, Sao Tome and Principe is still on\r\nthe list of poor, least advanced or underdeveloped\r\ncountries, despite the efforts of its people and the\r\ndetermination of its leaders to place it on the track of\r\ndevelopment. Today, my country is unquestionably a\r\nplace of freedom and democracy where fundamental\r\nindividual human rights are respected. The recent\r\npresidential elections, held in July this year, which\r\nbrought Mr. Fradique de Menezes to the highest office\r\nof the State of Sao Tome, are irrefutable proof of\r\ndemocratic stability in our country. Nevertheless, the\r\nconstraints arising from the inequalities that prevail in\r\nthe new international economic order keep us from\r\nattaining a state of well-being and from creating more\r\ndignified living conditions for our people.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit last year, the\r\nheads of State and Government adopted in this Hall a\r\nvery important text called the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration. I take pleasure in citing a\r\nportion of it:\r\n(spoke in French)\r\n“we have a duty therefore to all the world’s\r\npeople, especially the most vulnerable and, in\r\nparticular, the children of the world, to whom the\r\nfuture belongs”. (resolution 55/2, para. 2)\r\n(spoke in Portuguese; interpretation from French text\r\nprovided by the delegation)\r\nThis Declaration takes on particular importance\r\nin the case of our country, where the future and well-\r\nbeing of children seem badly compromised, bearing in\r\nmind the atmosphere of terror, the horrors of war and\r\nthe abuses of exploitation, famine and poverty. We\r\nmust act now to protect our children. We must fight by\r\nevery available means to ensure full respect for their\r\nfundamental rights. This is why we welcome with\r\nmuch satisfaction the Second World Conference\r\nagainst Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children,\r\nscheduled for next month, and the world summit on the\r\nfuture of children, to be held in May 2002.\r\nSao Tome and Principe considers globalization to\r\nbe a phenomenon of interdependence, a unique\r\nopportunity to bring peoples together, not a political\r\nideal driven by the dominant economic Powers. Thus\r\nwe enthusiastically welcome the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development and share the certainty that this\r\nplan — based on our needs and the aspirations of our\r\npeople for the future, and designed to find practical\r\nsolutions to the economic and social problems\r\nthroughout Africa — will be favourably received by\r\nour partners, notably those of the G-7/G-8, for\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe environment is a fundamental issue for the\r\nsurvival of mankind, and it must continue to be the\r\nfocus of special attention by the United Nations. We\r\ntherefore stress the importance of the outcome of the\r\nrecent seventh Conference of the Parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\r\nheld at Marrakesh. Every effort must be made to create\r\nand disseminate technology that can minimize the\r\nenvironmental impact of human activities and to\r\nmobilize the resources needed to implement the\r\npolicies and strategies adopted in a range of\r\ninternational forums.\r\nToday more than ever before, it is obvious that\r\nwe need to change the working methods of the organs\r\nof the United Nations so that they can better respond to\r\nthe demands of the day. As a universal organization,\r\nthe United Nations must be open to all States. Here we\r\nare talking about international law, the sovereign\r\nconduct of relations with other States, and active\r\nparticipation, in a spirit of solidarity, in development\r\nefforts through cooperation and international trade\r\nrelationships. That certainly applies to the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan. We believe in the right to disagree,\r\nespecially when disagreement is democratically\r\nexpressed by people. We also believe that dialogue is\r\nthe only way to ease tension wherever it is most acute.\r\nThe United Nations, which has always aimed to\r\nsupport the development efforts of all countries,\r\nespecially the poorest, must play a key role in the quest\r\nfor solutions to the major problems facing the world. It\r\nmust do so through fostering determination and\r\nadopting appropriate measures to create a fairer, more\r\nhuman world: a better world.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nAddress by Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo,\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Philippines\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\nMrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Philippines, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations Her Excellency Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-\r\nArroyo, President of the Republic of the Philippines,\r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Macapagal-Arroyo: Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating Your Excellency, Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\non your election as President of the General Assembly.\r\nI am especially gratified to be addressing the Assembly\r\nwhen a distinguished Asian is again at its helm.\r\nI congratulate as well His Excellency Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan on the Nobel Prize that he, together with the\r\nUnited Nations, has received. That prize constitutes\r\nrecognition by the international community of the\r\nindispensable role of the United Nations and of the\r\nnecessary work it has done on the Secretary-General’s\r\nwatch towards world peace and justice.\r\nAt the most elemental level, we feel most deeply\r\nthe sad and tragic impact of the recent inhuman acts of\r\nterrorism: the lost lives, the orphaned children, the\r\nwidowed spouses, the parents struck with the\r\nunimaginable grief of outliving their children and,\r\nworse yet, of watching them die. As we watched the\r\nhorror unfold, we felt as though it were happening to\r\nus — as indeed it was, for the United Nations is in a\r\nsense one family. The blow that was struck at this\r\ninternational city of New York was felt as directly by\r\nthe rest of the world. As people the world over stopped\r\nto watch in horror as the twin towers came down, the\r\nworld’s economies ground to a virtual halt.\r\nBusiness activity stopped, investments were\r\nwithdrawn, markets shrank, tourism dried up, more\r\njobs were lost, living standards dropped even further,\r\ndestitution spread and the very conditions that favour\r\nterrorism spread and deepened. Our misgivings about a\r\nworld slowdown deepened into certainty about a\r\nrecession that will be felt most deeply by those least\r\nable to endure it: not just classes but whole countries.\r\nThe average growth rate in the gross domestic product\r\nof developing countries could fall from last year’s 5.5\r\nper cent to 2.9 per cent. For most poor countries, that\r\nwill translate to sub-zero growth.\r\nThe face of terrorism that this city saw over a\r\nmonth ago is a familiar one to Asians. It has taken a\r\nterrible toll in terms of the lives of our people and the\r\neconomies of the region. It has destroyed our credit and\r\nhas deterred investment. It has caused Asian\r\nGovernments profound embarrassment at being caught\r\nflat-footed and unable to offer their citizens the most\r\nbasic security. In the south-western part of the\r\nPhilippines, it has taxed our resources and our patience\r\nto the limit, for terrorism is the argument of those who\r\nare not really interested in reasoning but only in getting\r\nwhatever they want on their terms alone.\r\nWe know terrorism. We are fighting it in the\r\nsouth-western Philippines. The perpetrators of the first\r\nattack on the World Trade Center were apprehended by\r\nour police. Rather than dismembering our country and\r\ndispossessing our people of their homes, we have been\r\nnegotiating with secessionist groups. But we have\r\nthrown the full weight of the law, including the use of\r\nforce, at those who have resorted to terrorism. We\r\nknow the enemy, and we know that these are not people\r\nyou talk to; these are people you fight. As the\r\nSecretary-General has pointed out, there are those who\r\nwill hate and who will kill even if every injustice is\r\nended. You must fight them in the field, when they take\r\nto the field and hunt them in cities when they hide\r\ninside.\r\nIt was in the light of that experience in the south-\r\nwestern Philippines that we immediately condemned\r\nthe terrorist attacks on the United States, for we\r\nrecognized them immediately as desperate and\r\ndespicable acts by that violent minority which seeks to\r\nenslave the world with fear. And indeed, they have\r\ngiven the world good reason to be afraid. The attack on\r\nthe World Trade Center, which aimed to take the lives\r\nof the 50,000 people who worked inside it, shows us an\r\nenemy without pity, without compunction and prepared\r\nto use any means to achieve the greatest destruction.\r\nThe Philippines did not need to join the war on\r\nterrorism: it was in that war already, in the south-\r\nwestern part of our islands. The Philippines could not\r\nhave done otherwise than to renew its commitment to\r\nfight terrorism in a wider field in the wake of 11\r\nSeptember. We know that this is an enemy that must be\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nfought everywhere so that it cannot again strike at will\r\nanywhere it pleases.\r\nThis is a fight between tolerance and bigotry,\r\nbetween reason and fanaticism, between law and\r\nanarchy, between justice and murder pretending to be\r\njust. In this fight, there is no side to choose but the one\r\nwhere the civilized nations of the world — long-time\r\nallies and former enemies — have chosen to stand\r\nunited, not least here in this Hall.\r\nThe Secretary-General has declared that the 11\r\nSeptember attacks struck at everything our\r\nOrganization stands for: peace, freedom, tolerance,\r\nhuman rights, and the very idea of a united human\r\nfamily.\r\nI do not know if the future belongs to our side,\r\nbut I am convinced that there will be no future if our\r\nside does not prevail in this fight — at least, no future\r\nthat any of us would care to live in. In fact, it would\r\nnot be a future in which most of us would be allowed\r\nto live. It would be a future where happiness was\r\nsuspect, delight was blasphemy, beauty was a cause for\r\nshame and independent thought a capital crime.\r\nBut while terrorism cannot be placated, and no\r\nterrorist should be appeased, there is no doubt in our\r\nminds, either, that we must address the concerns that\r\nthey pretend are the inspiration for their terrible deeds.\r\nIf the world can show that it will carry on, that it\r\nwill persevere in creating a stronger, more just, more\r\nbenevolent and more genuine international community\r\nacross all lines of religion and race, then terrorism will\r\nhave failed.\r\nNo, terrorism will not stop, but it will have failed.\r\nTo stop terrorism, the terrorists themselves will have to\r\nbe stopped. What we can do, however, is to strip them\r\nof their moral pretensions and take upon ourselves the\r\ncauses that they have perverted.\r\nNo nation will indefinitely endure the yawning\r\ngap between rich and poor — a gap that is only\r\ngrowing bigger, not just within, but across the\r\ncountries of the world. It is this growing disparity\r\nbetween the ever fewer rich and the ever-increasing\r\npoor that has given terrorism the freedom of movement\r\nand impunity from accountability that it has enjoyed.\r\nPoverty can be reduced partly by national\r\neconomic growth. But, more than that, societies have to\r\nadopt deliberate policies to ensure that the income\r\nlevels of the poor rise faster than those of the rich.\r\nRecent developments in the global economy have\r\ndisplayed the perils of overdependence on external\r\nmarkets. We must expand domestic demand and\r\nincrease the purchasing power of the masses of our\r\npeople.\r\nThis is largely the responsibility of each nation.\r\nWe in the Philippines are addressing the affront of\r\nmass poverty through housing, education, lower\r\nmedical costs, more efficient power, transportation and\r\ncommunications, infrastructure in the countryside,\r\ncredit to small farmers and micro-industries,\r\nproductivity, protection of the environment, and\r\ndevelopment of the areas farthest from our centre of\r\npolitical power and economic activity.\r\nThe international community also has a\r\nresponsibility in the elimination of poverty.\r\nCommitments to devote a certain percentage of gross\r\ndomestic product to official development assistance\r\nhave a place. But the most effective, and least costly,\r\nanti-poverty measure on a global scale is for developed\r\ncountries to open their markets wider to the products of\r\nthe developing countries, including in particular those\r\nproducts turned out by poor people in the poor\r\ncountries — agricultural commodities, textiles,\r\nclothing and footwear, as well as electrical and\r\nelectronic appliances and components.\r\nThe global trading system cannot allow\r\ndeveloped countries to subsidize heavily their\r\nagricultural exports while the developing countries are\r\nwithout the means to help their own farmers.\r\nThe recent Ministerial Meeting of the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) decided to launch a new\r\nround of multilateral trade negotiations. To ensure that\r\nthe WTO does not lose credibility at this crucial time,\r\nour top priority is to ensure that the Doha round is truly\r\na development round.\r\nThe effort to conquer poverty must embrace all\r\ncultures, all ethnic groups and all religious\r\ncommunities. Nations must allow all to preserve their\r\nown cultures.\r\nWe must make political autonomy accessible to\r\nregions that want it. At the same time, no one must be\r\nallowed to resort to terrorism to further political aims.\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nRespect for culture and religion, resources for\r\ndevelopment, openness to political autonomy within\r\nthe sovereignty of the nation and rejection of terrorism\r\nare the foundations of the Philippine approach to our\r\nethnic diversity and to the uplifting of our Muslim and\r\ntribal minorities.\r\nThe vision of nations where poverty is rapidly\r\nreduced cannot be attained in places where women and\r\ngirls are mistreated and their rights trampled upon. As\r\na woman head of State, woman head of Government\r\nand woman Commander-in-Chief of the world’s\r\nfourteenth largest nation, I say: we cannot conquer\r\npoverty without liberating women and girls where they\r\nare oppressed. The gender gap is a part of the\r\ndevelopment gap and must be addressed with equal\r\nvigour.\r\nThe fight against terrorism, the struggle to\r\neliminate poverty, the work on behalf of social and\r\ninternational justice, the strengthening of the rule of\r\nlaw, the promotion of tolerance and mutual respect, the\r\npractice of humanitarian compassion, the liberation of\r\nwomen, the never-ending quest for peace — these have\r\nlong been on the United Nations agenda. We in the\r\nPhilippines have been doing this in our region, in\r\ncooperation with our neighbours.\r\nThe heightened virulence of terrorism, the\r\nrenewed sense of insecurity among the world’s peoples\r\nand the alarming slowdown in the global economy\r\nhave intensified the urgency and importance of our\r\nwork. Together, let us get on with the job. It is serious.\r\nIt is essential. It is urgent.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof the Philippines for the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Philippines, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Nicolae Dudau, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Moldova.\r\nMr. Dudau (Republic of Moldova) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Allow me at the outset, Sir, to convey to you\r\nour warmest congratulations on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I am certain that your competence and\r\nactive cooperation with United Nations Member States\r\nwill pave the way for a successful and fruitful session.\r\nAllow me also to join previous speakers in\r\nexpressing our deep gratitude to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri, for his outstanding work and for the\r\nprofessional manner in which he presided over the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the Assembly.\r\nI should also like once again, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Moldova, to reiterate\r\nour warmest congratulations to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan on having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\r\nwhich was so well deserved, and for his re-election to\r\nanother term of office. His tireless efforts in redefining\r\nthe role of the United Nations in this changing world\r\nare certainly deeply appreciated and supported by my\r\nGovernment.\r\nThe barbaric terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nhave radically changed the international security\r\nenvironment. Terrorism has become the most serious\r\nand immediate threat to the security and stability of our\r\nStates. A challenge was laid down, not only to the\r\nUnited States of America, but to the entire world\r\ncommunity. We fully agree with the statement made by\r\nthe President of the United States, Mr. George Bush, in\r\nhis statement before this Assembly at the 44th plenary\r\nmeeting, that “that threat cannot be ignored” and that\r\n“civilization itself — the civilization we share — is\r\nthreatened”.\r\nThe fight against international terrorism has\r\nclearly become a priority for the United Nations. Today\r\nwe see a strong international coalition emerging which,\r\nin the short term, is determined to bring to justice the\r\nperpetrators of terrorist acts and, in the long term, to\r\neliminate this evil from the face of the earth.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova, which immediately\r\naligned itself with the ranks of this coalition, strongly\r\ncondemned the indiscriminate large-scale terrorist\r\nattacks that took place in New York, Washington, D.C.,\r\nand Pennsylvania. Moldova has also unreservedly\r\nsupported the actions undertaken by the United States\r\nin its legitimate self-defence and in accordance with\r\nthe United Nations Charter and Security Council\r\nresolution 1368 (2001). Likewise, we support the\r\nglobal and multidimensional approach adopted by the\r\nUnited States in its war against terrorism.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has demonstrated its\r\npolitical will to combat terrorist activities through\r\nconcerted efforts with other countries in the framework\r\nof various regional and subregional organizations.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nOur Government has strengthened its counter-\r\nterrorism legislation in order to comply with relevant\r\nregional and United Nations conventions and with the\r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nOur country is also taking measures in order to speed\r\nup accession to most of the remaining specialized\r\nUnited Nations counter-terrorism conventions. This\r\nmorning, I signed on behalf of my country the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have shown\r\nthat the international community must take further\r\nsteps to resolve the longstanding international\r\nproblems on which terrorism and violence feed. We\r\nmust urgently address the conflicts around the world\r\nand eliminate their root causes and factors that can\r\nnurture the development of terrorism.\r\nI feel obliged to add my voice to those who see\r\nthe phenomenon of separatism as a root cause of\r\nconflicts and a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. In a globalized and interdependent world,\r\nseparatism affects the bases of multicultural societies\r\nand poses grave danger to the sovereignty and integrity\r\nof States. Like international terrorism, separatism\r\nemphasizes what divides rather than what unites us. As\r\na country affected by separatism for many years, we\r\nhave constantly noted this phenomenon and the\r\nconnections it sometimes has with other serious\r\ncriminal activities, including sometimes terrorism. This\r\nis why, in our opinion, this issue, among others, must\r\nbe taken into account by the United Nations Member\r\nStates in their efforts to elaborate and implement a\r\ncomprehensive and efficient counter-terrorism strategy.\r\nThe fact that I am focusing on the issues of\r\nconflict settlement and separatism is not accidental.\r\nOver the years, my delegation has informed the\r\nAssembly of the efforts being made to resolve the\r\nconflict in the Transdniestrian region of the Republic\r\nof Moldova. However, I am obliged to note with regret\r\nthe lack of any noticeable positive developments\r\ntowards a comprehensive settlement. Despite the\r\nreasonable compromises on the part of the\r\nconstitutional authorities in my country, the separatist\r\nregime continues to completely oppose any proposals\r\nto grant special status to the region as a constituent part\r\nof the Republic of Moldova. Moreover, the leaders of\r\nthat region have given a unilateral interpretation to\r\npolitical documents worked out with the active\r\nmediation of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine and the\r\nRussian Federation.\r\nAnother matter of continuing concern is the fact\r\nthat in recent years the illegal production of different\r\ntypes of armaments has been noted in this region.\r\nThese armaments have reached other conflict zones\r\nthrough third countries, supporting terrorists, criminal\r\ngroups and secessionist movements.\r\nWe should like to state once again that a complete\r\nand unconditional withdrawal of troops, munitions and\r\narmaments, as stipulated in the Istanbul OSCE Summit\r\ndocuments, would undoubtedly facilitate the peaceful\r\nand lasting settlement of this conflict.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to emphasize that\r\nmy Government encourages the recent efforts of the\r\nRussian Federation to cut back on its weapons\r\ndeployed in the Transdniestrian region of the Republic\r\nof Moldova, in accordance with the Treaty on\r\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe. Given the\r\nconsiderable progress that has been already made, we\r\ncertainly hope that the process of destruction and\r\nremoval of the weaponry will be completed before the\r\nBucharest OSCE ministerial meeting this December. I\r\nwould like also to express our gratitude to those\r\nMembers of the United Nations that have contributed\r\nfinancially to the OSCE voluntary fund established in\r\naccordance with the Istanbul decisions.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in international\r\npeace and security remains an essential part of its\r\nglobal responsibilities. The Republic of Moldova\r\nreiterates its conviction that the best strategy for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security is to\r\neliminate the root causes of conflicts. In this regard, we\r\nfully support the Secretary-General’s efforts to move\r\ninto a culture of conflict prevention.\r\nThe submission of periodic regional reports to the\r\nSecurity Council on disputes of various types that may\r\npotentially threaten international peace and security is\r\nanother important and necessary measure. The unequal\r\nattention given by the international system to different\r\nconflicts is still a matter of great concern. In order to\r\nbe successful, preventive strategies must reach all\r\nregions in crisis.\r\nThe credibility of the United Nations is called\r\ninto question whenever decisions mandating action in a\r\nparticular crisis are not matched by timely deployment\r\nof peacekeeping forces. Experience in recent years has\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nshown that the United Nations capacity to meet an\r\nexpanding and increasingly complex range of\r\npeacekeeping demands needs significant improvement.\r\nWe are pleased to note that action has been taken to\r\nimplement a number of practical measures proposed by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his second report on the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the Brahimi\r\nreport on peace operations.\r\nMoldova has already established the legislation\r\nand institutional framework for its future participation\r\nin the peacekeeping operations. I should also like to\r\nexpress the readiness of the Republic of Moldova to\r\nparticipate in the stand-by system, for which the\r\ninstitutional and technical preparations are currently in\r\ntheir concluding stage.\r\nAs we seek to enhance the United Nations\r\ncapacity in conflict prevention and peacekeeping, we\r\nmust also strengthen international cooperation for the\r\npromotion of sustainable development and the\r\nelimination of poverty worldwide. Development and\r\npoverty elimination are issues of tremendous\r\nimportance to many Member States, including my own.\r\nOur economic development has been gravely affected\r\nby the illegal actions of separatists, as well by the\r\nnegative consequences of globalization. These issues\r\nhave been considered very important by our leaders at\r\nthe Millennium Summit.\r\nSince the beginning of this year the world\r\neconomy has experienced a certain slowdown. In the\r\naftermath of the incidents of 11 September, this\r\ntendency has been exacerbated. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration recognized that the problems of both\r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\r\ntransition have become even more acute, even tragic in\r\nrecent months, as a result of globalization. We hope\r\nthat developed countries will increase their support for\r\nus in dealing with our problems by granting greater\r\nassistance for development. Debt cancellation would\r\nplay a significant role in allowing us to free up\r\nfinancial resources and redirect them towards\r\nstimulating our economies.\r\nIn meeting the challenges of globalization, the\r\nUnited Nations plays an indispensable role in\r\ninternational cooperation. We welcome its greater\r\nparticipation in development issues and in facing the\r\ntasks set out in the Millennium Declaration. These\r\ngoals cannot be reached without significant financial\r\nsupport. The International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment to be held next year offer a unique\r\nopportunity to find the resources required to meet those\r\ngoals. We hope that the outcome of these two\r\nsignificant international events will be successful in\r\nthis regard.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova remains open to all\r\nforms of cooperation and is willing to contribute, as\r\nmuch as possible, to reaching the common goals of\r\nsustainable development and economic stability. We\r\nconsider that a comprehensive approach, based on the\r\nexperience of other States and on the specific cultural\r\ncharacter of a given country or region, will help us\r\nidentify and apply the best strategy for sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to remain relevant\r\nand credible, it must maintain a strong commitment to\r\nthe continuing programme of reform and renewal. The\r\nreforms that have been undertaken and implemented in\r\nrecent years have already done much to strengthen and\r\nrevitalize the Organization. However, much remains to\r\nbe done and, in particular, we need to intensify our\r\nefforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Republic of Moldova believes\r\nthat this reform should be guided by principles of\r\nequitable geographic representation, democracy,\r\neffectiveness, efficiency and transparency. It is on this\r\nbasis that we will be able to modernize the Security\r\nCouncil and bring it into line with the substantial\r\nincrease in the general membership of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn this context I would like once again to reiterate\r\nthe position of my country with respect to the\r\nenlargement of the Security Council in both permanent\r\nand non-permanent categories: the Eastern European\r\nGroup should be given one additional non-permanent\r\nmembership seat.\r\nOur country welcomes the process of\r\nrevitalization and improvement of the General\r\nAssembly and, at the same time, supports efforts to\r\nrestore the central role of the Assembly as a main\r\nrepresentative body for debate at the United Nations.\r\nThis year the Republic of Moldova is celebrating\r\nthe tenth anniversary of its independence. During these\r\n10 years as a Member State of the United Nations, we\r\nhave fully shared the common values of the\r\nOrganization. We have achieved many significant\r\nresults in our internal development; much remains to\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nbe done, however. We have nonetheless laid down the\r\nfoundations of a democratic society. This was not an\r\neasy task, but we have made progress. The most\r\nimportant achievement has been that we have laid\r\ndown the foundations of a democratic society, with\r\nbasic human rights and the rights of national minorities\r\nbeing respected. The main achievement has been the\r\nconsolidation of the Republic of Moldova as a peace-\r\nloving independent European country.\r\nThe dramatic change of the situation in the\r\ninternational arena in the aftermath of the tragic events\r\nof 11 September calls for a new vision and a\r\nredefinition of the specific mechanisms for realizing\r\nthe fundamental objectives of the Organization, which\r\nspring essentially from the founding philosophy of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. In this respect, the\r\nOrganization should draw conclusions from its own\r\npast and, relying on permanent support from its\r\nMember States, accomplish new tasks in the light of\r\nthe imperatives of the time. I join in expressing the\r\nhope that the proceedings of the General Assembly —\r\nwhich are absolutely necessary for the international\r\ncommunity in the twenty-first century — will also\r\nmake it possible to ensure that this process moves in a\r\npositive direction.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mahmoud Hammoud, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Lebanon.\r\nMr. Hammoud (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nMr. President, allow me first to congratulate you on\r\nyour election as President of the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, which is meeting under critical\r\nand exceptional circumstances. We wish you every\r\nsuccess in your arduous endeavours. I also wish to\r\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri. In addition,\r\non this occasion, I would like to pay tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for the efforts he has\r\nmade throughout the year. We hope that he will be able\r\nto enhance the prospects for peace, stability, and\r\ndevelopment in the world during his second term of\r\noffice.\r\nThe whole world was shocked by the enormity of\r\nthe tragedy that struck the United States of America on\r\n11 September — the barbaric terrorist acts against New\r\nYork City and Washington, D.C. These acts exacted a\r\nhigh toll among innocent civilians and plunged the\r\npeoples and countries of the world into an atmosphere\r\nof gloom and anxiety. We once again extend our\r\ncondolences to the families who lost their loved ones;\r\nsome of them were Lebanese, or American of Lebanese\r\ndescent. We share their deep sense of grief and sorrow.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to reiterate\r\nLebanon’s condemnation of these terrorist attacks.\r\nLebanon stands ready to cooperate seriously, positively\r\nand responsibly with the United States and the United\r\nNations in the fight against terrorism, in accordance\r\nwith the rules of international law and with the\r\nprerogatives of national sovereignty.\r\nFor a long time, Lebanon has suffered from\r\nIsraeli occupation and Israel’s terrorist practices. We\r\nresisted this occupation until it ultimately ended with\r\nIsrael’s withdrawal from most of our national\r\nterritories. It is perfectly normal in this context to\r\nstress the need for distinguishing between terrorism,\r\nwhich we strongly condemn, and peoples’ legitimate\r\nright to struggle for the liberation of their territories\r\nfrom foreign occupation on the basis of the United\r\nNations Charter and General Assembly resolutions. As\r\nregards Lebanon, we have to refer to the April\r\nUnderstanding of 1996, an agreement which was\r\nreached under the auspices of the United States and\r\nFrance after Israel had carried out the Qana Massacre\r\nthat same year, in addition to the Taif Agreement that\r\nhad laid down the tenets of our national reconciliation.\r\nA series of Security Council presidential statements\r\nhave given the Council’s blessing to the Agreement.\r\nBoth the Taif Agreement and the April Understanding\r\nrecognized the legitimacy of resistance against the\r\nIsraeli occupation.\r\nLet me recall here that had Israel not invaded\r\nLebanon on 14 March 1978, there would have been no\r\nLebanese Resistance — which, of course, is the subject\r\nof our pride — to counter this invasion.\r\nHad Security Council resolution 425 (1978)\r\nadopted on 19 March been implemented without delay,\r\nas stipulated in its provisions, the Resistance would not\r\nhave been born.\r\nHad it not been for widening the scope of the\r\nIsraeli invasion of Lebanese territory and the\r\nsubsequent occupation of Beirut in 1982, the\r\nResistance would not have escalated.\r\nHad it not been for Israel’s persistence in\r\noccupying what it called “the security zone”, no one\r\nwould have had to resist it and ultimately force it to\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nwithdraw in May 2000 from most of the territories that\r\nit had occupied.\r\nHad Israel not occupied the Palestinian territories,\r\nthere would have been no need for a courageous\r\nuprising against occupation.\r\nIt must be pointed out that Lebanon is determined\r\nto fight terrorism. We have acceded to 10 out of the 12\r\nconventions relevant to the question of international\r\nterrorism. We stand ready to respond positively to any\r\ninternational initiative, including the convening of an\r\ninternational conference for this purpose, to arrive at a\r\nstandard definition of terrorism. It would be wise not to\r\nlink terrorism to a particular race or religion,\r\nparticularly to Arabs and Muslims, if we want to avoid\r\nsetting world civilizations and religions on a collision\r\ncourse. We can thus avoid falling into the trap designed\r\nby those who are pushing the world towards collision,\r\nconflict and strife.\r\nSide by side with its Arab brothers, Lebanon is\r\ndetermined to exert additional efforts to combat\r\nterrorism and eradicate its various root causes. In 1998,\r\nArab States successfully negotiated and concluded the\r\nArab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, a\r\nConvention with clear-cut purposes and objectives.\r\nThe events of 11 September have demonstrated\r\nthat humanity has not yet reached its ultimate\r\nevolutionary stage. They also prove that unbridled\r\nglobal rejectionist movements and terrorist groups that\r\nknow no boundaries and accept no restrictions are\r\ncapable of undermining our confidence in everything\r\nwe have achieved so far. They are working to establish\r\nwhat can be referred to as a “new world disorder” and\r\nglobal instability.\r\nUnder the circumstances, and given prevailing\r\nfears, a thorough look at what is happening in the\r\nMiddle East conflict zone would clearly reveal the\r\ndifficulty of realizing the objectives of peace and\r\ndevelopment promoted by the United Nations. In recent\r\nmonths, the world has witnessed continued Israeli\r\noccupation of Palestinian territories, unjust and\r\narbitrary Israeli practices, desecration of holy sites,\r\nblockades, killings, assassinations and displacements.\r\nSuch acts continue with no international deterrence or\r\ncontrol.\r\nIntransigent Israeli policies, deviation from the\r\nMadrid principles and terms of reference, and stripping\r\nthe peace process of its political content in favour of\r\nso-called Israeli security considerations indicate that\r\nprojected solutions to the Middle East crisis are\r\ndivided among many conflicting rationales. There is\r\nthe rationale of a partial solution and that of a\r\ncomprehensive solution; the rationale of basing a\r\nsolution on force and that of basing it on what is right,\r\njust and grounded in United Nations resolutions; the\r\nrationale of achieving security at the expense of peace\r\nand that of making peace the foundation of security.\r\nIn the aftermath of 11 September, attention has\r\nfocused on the need to step up the effort to find a\r\npolitical solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, a solution\r\nthat should allow the Palestinian people to establish an\r\nindependent Palestinian State on their national soil. It\r\nis our duty to recall that a just and comprehensive\r\npeace necessitates that we simultaneously address all\r\naspects of the Middle East conflict. The Lebanese and\r\nSyrian tracks must not be separated from the track of\r\nthe overall settlement. That track is stalled, and\r\nreviving it will require the devotion of additional\r\nefforts. The liberation of Lebanese territories from\r\nIsraeli occupation must be completed. Israel must\r\nwithdraw from the entire occupied Syrian Golan\r\nHeights to the line of 4 June 1967. The question of\r\nPalestinian refugees, their legitimate right to return,\r\nand Lebanon’s right to oppose their resettlement on its\r\nterritories must not be ignored. This opposition is\r\ngrounded in the principles of fairness, justice and\r\nsovereignty.\r\nIn the light of the above, we believe that a\r\ncomprehensive peace built on justice and on the\r\nresolutions conferring international legitimacy is the\r\nsole guarantee of the sustainability of any desirable\r\nsolution.\r\nThere are two fundamental questions in Lebanon\r\nthat are of direct concern to the United Nations: one is\r\nthe mandate of the international forces in southern\r\nLebanon and the other is the destiny of Palestinian\r\nrefugees in Lebanon.\r\nIn paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution\r\n1365 (2001), which was adopted on 31 July, the\r\nSecurity Council requested the Secretary-General to\r\nsubmit a comprehensive report on the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL),\r\ntaking into account its possible reconfiguration into an\r\nobserver mission in the light of the developments on\r\nthe ground, following appropriate consultations with\r\nthe Government of Lebanon.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nDue to the gravity of the situation, and in\r\nanticipation of the Secretary-General’s report, it is\r\nimportant for me to stress from this rostrum that both\r\nlogic and the realities on the ground call for\r\nmaintaining Unifier’s existing mandate without\r\namending it or reconfiguring the mission into an\r\nobserver force. On the contrary, we believe that\r\nUNIFIL’s role must be strengthened, particularly as it\r\nhas not yet fulfilled the entire mandate entrusted to it\r\nby the international community in Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978), which was adopted on 19 March\r\n1978. That mandate cannot be implemented by an\r\nobserver force due to the following questions that are\r\nstill pending.\r\nThe first pending question is the verification of\r\nthe Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territories. It\r\nis a known fact that the United Nations did not verify\r\nthe Israeli withdrawal from all Lebanese territories. It\r\nonly verified the withdrawal of Israeli forces to a de\r\nfacto withdrawal line, which became known as the blue\r\nline. That line is not in conformity with Lebanon’s\r\ninternationally recognized borders, a fact recognized in\r\nsubsequent reports of the Secretary-General.\r\nTherefore, the Shab’a farms, on the slopes of\r\nMount Hermon, remained under Israeli occupation,\r\ntogether with three additional points along the line of\r\nwithdrawal drawn by the United Nations. At the time,\r\nLebanon expressed its reservations on these points.\r\nThese territories are Lebanese lands and Lebanon\r\nreserves its natural right to restore them and to extend\r\nits sovereignty to them. Lebanon would like to stress\r\nhere that it will stand up for every inch of its national\r\nsoil and for all its rights to its water resources, in\r\naccordance with international law. In that regard, we\r\nmust draw attention to the fact that Israel continues to\r\nviolate Lebanese sovereignty on a daily basis. In his\r\nreport issued in July of this year, the Secretary-General\r\ndescribed these violations as provocative. Furthermore,\r\nIsrael continues to increase the frequency of its threats\r\nagainst Lebanon and Syria.\r\nThe second pending question concerns the\r\nrestoration of international peace and security. In his\r\nreports to the Security Council between May 2000 and\r\nJuly 2001, the Secretary-General recognized that\r\nUNIFIL had not fully implemented the task entrusted\r\nto it. He repeatedly said that there is a third task the\r\ninternational forces have yet to undertake, and on\r\nwhich UNIFIL will have to concentrate. That task is\r\nthe restoration of international peace and security in\r\nthe region. How can we speak of a third task yet to be\r\ncompleted by UNIFIL under Security Council\r\nresolution 425 (1978) and at the same time discuss the\r\npossibility of reconfiguring UNIFIL into an observer\r\nmission?\r\nIn that respect, we are duty-bound to recall that\r\nthe security of the region is indivisible. We would be\r\ndeceiving ourselves if we were to believe that peace\r\nand security can be restored to the region outside the\r\ncontext of a comprehensive overall solution to all\r\naspects of the conflict on all its tracks. Such an\r\nundertaking requires an all-inclusive effort, not only by\r\nUNIFIL but also by the entire United Nations, which\r\nshould be responsible for the enforcement of its\r\nresolutions, particularly resolution 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973) and 425 (1978).\r\nFrom this rostrum, I call on the United Nations\r\nSecretariat and the Security Council to preserve\r\nUNIFIL’s existing mandate. The timing is of particular\r\nimportance, given the serious circumstances prevailing\r\nin our region and in the world. We must also recall that\r\nin May of this year the Security Council adopted a\r\nstatement in which members acknowledged Lebanon’s\r\nconcerns and apprehensions, including those relating to\r\nthe future.\r\nLebanon is tirelessly seeking to achieve a total\r\nIsraeli withdrawal from its territories. At the same\r\ntime, it attaches great importance to the release of the\r\nLebanese people kidnapped by Israel during its\r\noccupation of our land and thereafter detained in Israeli\r\njails. They remain incarcerated in Israeli prisons as\r\nhostages, in contravention of international laws and\r\ninstruments, particularly the Geneva Convention of\r\n1949 and the subsequent Protocols thereto.\r\nThe 130,000 landmines that were left behind by\r\nthe Israeli occupation are still killing, maiming and\r\nharming scores of civilians in Lebanon. They curtail\r\ntheir freedom of movement and obstruct their work. We\r\nconsider this to be a continued — albeit indirect —\r\nform of occupation of Lebanese territories by Israel. In\r\nthe light of this situation, the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community should make a greater effort\r\nto compel Israel to hand over all maps and records\r\ndisclosing the locations of the mines, which have to be\r\ncleared as soon a possible.\r\nHowever, with respect to the hundreds of\r\nthousands of Palestinian refugees who have been\r\nprovisionally hosted on Lebanese land ever since their\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nexpulsion from their homes in Palestine — and for\r\nwhose final status the United Nations bears essential\r\nresponsibility — we reiterate our demand for a just\r\nsolution to their cause, on the basis of the\r\nimplementation of their right to return and of our\r\nrefusal to resettle them in Lebanon.\r\nIn this regard, it behoves us to remember that the\r\nresettlement of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon\r\nwould constitute a time bomb that would jeopardize the\r\npeace, security and stability in the Middle East; such\r\nrefugees will relentlessly seek to return to their\r\nhomeland and Lebanon is unable to integrate them,\r\ngiven the precariousness of its own internal\r\nequilibrium and the fact that provisions of its national\r\npact do not allow for any form of resettlement.\r\nFurthermore, Lebanon appeals for greater\r\ninternational attention to enable us to provide urgently\r\nneeded assistance that could help return our liberated\r\nlands to normalcy, restore economic balance and\r\nprovide opportunities for growth after long years of\r\noccupation and destruction.\r\nThis is an era of responsibility and accountability\r\nfor the world, but accountability cannot be selective,\r\nnor can it be based on double standards. During the\r\nlong years of occupation of the Lebanese territories,\r\nIsraeli bombardment and the destruction that ensued\r\nkilled thousands and injured and disabled thousands\r\nmore. Our infrastructure, vital facilities, houses,\r\nschools, farms and bridges were destroyed and our\r\ngrowth and development were hindered. Lebanon must\r\ntherefore be adequately compensated. Lebanon will\r\nspare no effort in appealing to the relevant international\r\npolitical and judicial organs to request that Israel make\r\nreparations for the damage resulting from its acts of\r\naggression.\r\nIt may be useful to recall here that Israel did not\r\nwithdraw from most of the Lebanese territories of its\r\nown accord; neither did it withdraw in compliance with\r\nthe decision of an international authority or in response\r\nto a political requirement that remained on the table for\r\nover 22 years. Rather, it withdrew under pressure from\r\nthe Lebanese resistance, which was embraced by the\r\nLebanese State. It withdrew because of the\r\nsteadfastness of the Lebanese people. Its withdrawal\r\nwas not a voluntary démarche for peace, as some\r\nwould have it. The withdrawal was a measure taken to\r\navoid peace, and instead to seek alleged security at the\r\nexpense of the requirements of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace.\r\nLebanon is a democratic Arab country, open to\r\nthe world, with a civilization that goes back thousands\r\nof years. Thanks to our diverse social composition, our\r\nexperience is informed by coexistence and consensus.\r\nIt is a unique experience, rarely paralleled in our world\r\ntoday. We call on the Assembly to mobilize the forces\r\nof peace and justice in order to redress the historical\r\ninjustice inflicted upon the Palestinian people. The\r\nAssembly must bring about a just and comprehensive\r\nsolution to one of the most complex and dangerous\r\nregional conflicts in the Middle East. It is a conflict\r\nthat has depleted the resources of its people, hindered\r\nits progress and stunted its contributions to the world.\r\nThis solution will unfetter its creative capabilities and\r\nenable it to develop a global partnership free from fear,\r\ninjustice and terror.\r\nMy country is proud to be hosting the next Arab\r\nSummit, to be convened in Beirut in March next year.\r\nPreparations are already under way to receive the Arab\r\nmonarchs and presidents. We will also be hosting the\r\nNinth Summit of the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie in the fall of 2002, under the heading,\r\n“Dialogue among cultures”. Lebanon is a founding\r\nmember of the League of Arab States, the United\r\nNations and the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie. Lebanon, which participated in drafting\r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is capable\r\nof proving that it can reassert its active presence and\r\nagain take a pioneering role at the regional and\r\ninternational levels. We come from a time-honoured\r\ncivilization, and are blessed by unique and\r\ndistinguished experience of coexistence. We will put\r\nthis to the service of the noble objectives of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Sahr Matturi, Deputy Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nMr. Matturi (Sierra Leone): My delegation\r\nextends to you, Sir, its warmest congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of this body at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. Given your impressive credentials, we are\r\nconfident that under your guidance we will conclude\r\nour deliberations successfully. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our appreciation to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, who\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nadmirably conducted the affairs of the epoch-making\r\nMillennium Assembly last year.\r\nLet me also warmly congratulate our\r\nindefatigable Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, on\r\nhis reappointment to a second term of office and on his\r\naward, with the United Nations, of the 2001 Nobel\r\nPrize for Peace. As citizens of the West African\r\nsubregion, we in Sierra Leone are proud of his\r\nstewardship. Sierra Leone is indeed indebted to him,\r\nthe staff of the Secretariat and the United Nations\r\nfamily for their invaluable support of our effort to\r\nsecure peace and stability in my country.\r\nForty years ago, on 29 September to be exact,\r\nSierra Leone was admitted as the one hundredth\r\nMember of the United Nations. During the period that\r\nfollowed, we made our own modest contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\r\nhave faithfully adhered to the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter. We have practised, and continue to\r\npractise, tolerance and good-neighbourliness. Our faith\r\nin the Organization remains as strong as it was 40 years\r\nago.\r\nAt the same time, the United Nations and its\r\nagencies have done a lot for the people of Sierra\r\nLeone. As President Kabbah told the Millennium\r\nSummit last year, in the course of its membership,\r\nSierra Leone has tested the capacity of the United\r\nNations to respond to major challenges, especially in\r\nthe areas of peacekeeping, through the United Nations\r\nMission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and of\r\nhumanitarian law, through the proposed special court to\r\ntry those who bear the greatest responsibility for\r\nserious violations of Sierra Leonean law, war crimes\r\nand crimes against humanity committed in Sierra\r\nLeone. In conveying our sincere thanks to the\r\nOrganization and the rest of the international\r\ncommunity for their support, my delegation expresses\r\nthe hope that Sierra Leone and the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to work closely for peace, security and\r\nsustainable development in the coming years.\r\nSadly, this session of the General Assembly is\r\ntaking place in the aftermath of the despicable acts of\r\nterrorism inflicted on our host country on 11 September\r\n2001 — acts that claimed the lives of thousands of\r\nAmericans and of the nationals of 86 other countries.\r\nAs we share their grief and renew our heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims and the\r\nGovernment of the United States, we Sierra Leoneans\r\nare reminded of that ominous day in January 1999\r\nwhen over 5,000 innocent civilians were brutally killed\r\nduring the rebel onslaught on our capital city. Hundreds\r\nof others, including children and young girls, were\r\nabducted or raped or had limbs deliberately amputated.\r\nTerrorism in all its forms and manifestations is\r\ndeplorable and must be eradicated. My delegation\r\nwould like to assure this Assembly that we shall do\r\neverything within our power and available resources to\r\nsupport the current multilateral counter-terrorism effort\r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nThe new emerging coalition to counteract the\r\nscourge of terrorism is absolutely necessary. However,\r\nthe Sierra Leone delegation strongly believes that we\r\nshould also strengthen existing coalitions or build new\r\nones against those forces that continue to kill millions\r\nof children and adults throughout the world every\r\nsingle day. We know these forces. We know their\r\nvicious and destructive powers. Hunger, poverty,\r\nmalnutrition, malaria, HIV/AIDS, brutality and\r\nintolerance — these are but a few of them.\r\nSierra Leone calls upon this Assembly and the\r\nentire international community to use the current\r\ninternational solidarity against terrorism to translate the\r\nAgenda for Peace, the Agenda for Development, the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Declaration and Plan of\r\nAction of the World Summit for Children and similar\r\nstrategies and goals into a series of new coalitions: a\r\nnew coalition against childhood diseases; a new\r\ncoalition against poverty and human\r\nunderdevelopment; a new coalition against the scourge\r\nof HIV/AIDS and malaria; and a brand new coalition\r\nagainst the accumulation of nuclear weapons and other\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nThere has been a marked improvement in the\r\nsituation in Sierra Leone. The serious humanitarian\r\ncrisis still prevails, but is gradually subsiding.\r\nThousands of ex-combatants have been disarmed and\r\ndemobilized. Government authority and civil\r\nadministrative services are gradually being established\r\nin areas previously occupied by rebels. Our\r\nrestructured army is now truly professional, thanks to\r\nthe intensive training programme directed by the\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom.\r\nBy all accounts, we can say that the overall\r\nsecurity and safety situation is one of great expectation.\r\nIn the coming months, the people of Sierra Leone will\r\nonce again start to enjoy to the fullest extent their basic\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nright to life — a life free from brutal armed rebellion\r\nsuch as that provoked and abetted by external forces\r\nand fuelled by blood diamonds for 10 long years. In\r\nthis connection, my delegation would like to express\r\nour sincere gratitude to the United Nations and its\r\nagencies, the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), UNAMSIL troop-contributing\r\ncountries, the United Kingdom and other friendly\r\nnations for their individual and collective contributions\r\nto the peace process in Sierra Leone.\r\nAllow me from this rostrum to express the\r\ncondolences of the Government and people of Sierra\r\nLeone for those brave and dedicated ambassadors of\r\npeace from the United Kingdom, Zambia, the Ukraine\r\nand Bulgaria who lost their lives in the recent\r\nhelicopter accidents in my country.\r\nDespite our optimism for peace and stability in\r\nSierra Leone, past experience of adventurous attempts\r\nby the rebels to renege on their obligations under peace\r\nagreements have taught us a lesson: We have to remain\r\nconstantly vigilant. The safety and security of the\r\npeople will remain high on our national agenda, as will\r\nthe process of consolidating the peace through\r\nsustainable development. This is why we would like\r\nthe United Nations, especially the Security Council, to\r\ncontinue to generate the necessary international support\r\nfor our post-conflict and peace-building effort.\r\nIn this connection, we would like to draw the\r\nattention of the international community and those who\r\nassist us in the implementation of our disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration programme to the fact\r\nthat the disarmament and demobilization of ex-\r\ncombatants will soon come to a successful end.\r\nHowever, the process of reintegration remains crucial.\r\nWe could lose the gains we have made in the peace\r\nprocess if we allow the reintegration of ex-combatants\r\nto collapse for lack of adequate funding. As President\r\nKabbah pointed out recently, we also have tens of\r\nthousands of young people who have never seen,\r\ntouched or used an AK-47 rifle or a rocket-propelled\r\ngrenade. They, too, are waiting to be integrated into the\r\nmainstream of our economic and social sectors.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to\r\nappeal to the international community, as a matter of\r\nurgency, to help us remove some of the root causes of\r\nconflict by increasing support for our reintegration and\r\nintegration programmes for the benefit of youths. We\r\nshould no longer allow the legitimate social and\r\neconomic needs or grievances of these young people to\r\nbe exploited by ruthless warlords whose sole objective\r\nis to drain our precious mineral resources for their own\r\nselfish ends.\r\nSpeaking of diamonds, I would like to inform this\r\nAssembly that our diamond certification system,\r\nestablished under Security Council resolution 1306\r\n(2000), has so far been a major success. First, there has\r\nbeen a substantial increase in revenue from legitimate\r\ndiamonds since the system was established just over a\r\nyear ago. Secondly, it has also helped to reduce the\r\nincidence of an old problem that preceded the\r\nphenomenon of conflict or blood diamonds — namely,\r\nsmuggling. My Government is in the process of\r\nupdating the status of the certification system in its\r\nthird report to the Security Council through the\r\nCommittee that is monitoring the implementation of\r\nresolution 1306 (2000).\r\nThe sacrifices we have made for peace in Sierra\r\nLeone are not for Sierra Leoneans alone; they are also\r\nin the interest of peace and stability in the Mano River\r\nUnion triangle in particular and the West African\r\nsubregion as a whole. The recent rapprochement at the\r\nministerial level, followed by meetings of the Joint\r\nSecurity Committee and the initiative launched by the\r\nMano River Union Women Peace Network in the three\r\ncountries — Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone — augur\r\nwell for the proposed Mano River Union summit\r\nmeeting. Meanwhile, I can assure the Assembly that\r\nPresident Kabbah remains committed to his\r\ndetermination to help restore adherence to the principle\r\nof good-neighbourliness in the Union. This should lead\r\nto a revitalization of economic cooperation\r\nprogrammes among the three countries. We must admit\r\nthat conflict and tension in the Union have had a\r\nnegative impact on the ability of ECOWAS to\r\nconcentrate on the principal objective for which it was\r\ncreated, namely, economic cooperation and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Balzan (Malta), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe are aware that primary responsibility for\r\nalleviating poverty, stimulating economic growth and\r\nreducing conflicts and their often disastrous\r\nconsequences lies in the hands of the developing\r\ncountries themselves. We are also aware that\r\ndevelopment requires sound fiscal policies and rational\r\nmanagement of both our human and natural resources.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nHowever, the international consensus is that\r\nsustainable development also requires greater\r\ncooperation between developing and developed\r\ncountries in such areas as trade, debt relief and external\r\nfinancing. In this regard, Sierra Leone, one of the least\r\ndeveloped countries in the world, eagerly looks\r\nforward to the results of the forthcoming Conference\r\non Financing for Development and the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development.\r\nThere are many pressing and unresolved\r\nproblems on the international peace and security\r\nagenda of the United Nations. One of them is the\r\nsituation in Palestine. It remains the core issue in the\r\nsearch for peace in the Middle East. In our view, it also\r\nbreeds tension, and directly fans the flames of war in\r\nother parts of the world. In the current state of affairs it\r\nis no longer enough to speak about the right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination. They have a\r\nright to an independent State of their own. In short, the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State is\r\nwell overdue. In terms of international peace and\r\nsecurity, we cannot afford any further delay.\r\nSierra Leone is obviously not a nuclear Power.\r\nHowever, as a member of the human family, we are\r\nconcerned about the threat or use of nuclear weapons.\r\nIndeed, we believe that these weapons pose the greatest\r\nthreat to human survival. Therefore, we shall continue\r\nto support universal adherence to regional and\r\ninternational disarmament and non-proliferation\r\ninstruments. For instance, Sierra Leone recently\r\nratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty,\r\nwhich we strongly believe is central to the question of\r\nthe vertical, or qualitative, proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons.\r\nWe are also seriously concerned about the\r\nproliferation of conventional arms, including those that\r\nhave brought untold suffering to the people of Sierra\r\nLeone during the past 10 years.\r\nLast July, at the United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nAll Its Aspects, we pleaded in vain for action to\r\nprevent the transfer of these weapons to non-State\r\nentities such as terrorists and rebels who commit\r\natrocities against innocent civilians. The recent\r\nterrorist attacks and the awareness that biological\r\nweapons in the hands of such non-State entities pose a\r\nthreat to us all should, in the view of my delegation,\r\nprod those Member States that were unable to support\r\nour plea last July to seriously reconsider their position\r\non this important issue of arms transfers to non-State\r\nentities. We also need their full support in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action adopted at\r\nthat important Conference.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is convinced that\r\nthe international community has at its disposal the\r\ninstruments, institutions, strategies, targets and road\r\nmaps for counteracting and eradicating terrorism, HIV/\r\nAIDS, malaria, hunger, malnutrition and other deadly\r\nforces, through closer multilateral cooperation.\r\nLet the fifty-sixth session of this Assembly,\r\nwhich was interrupted by the common enemy of\r\nterrorism, go down in history as the new multilateral\r\ncooperation session, one that should inspire all nations,\r\nlarge and small, nuclear and non-nuclear, to deal\r\nresolutely with the other common enemies of the\r\nhuman race.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on\r\nMr. Anastase Gasana, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nRwanda.\r\nMr. Gasana (Rwanda) (spoke in French): It is a\r\ngreat honour for me, on behalf of the Rwandan\r\ndelegation, to join previous speakers in extending from\r\nthis rostrum of the United Nations our sincere and\r\nwarm congratulations to Mr. Han Seung-soo on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at the\r\nfifty-sixth session. I should also like to take this\r\nopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to his\r\npredecessor for the farsightedness with which he led\r\nthe work of the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI also wish, on behalf of my Government, to\r\nextend my warm congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on\r\nhis re-election as Secretary-General of our\r\nOrganization. His remarkable efforts in strengthening\r\nthe role of the United Nations and his numerous\r\ninitiatives to resolve conflicts have been eloquently\r\nattested to by his election to a second term of office,\r\nand even more by the Nobel Peace Prize that has just\r\nbeen awarded to him.\r\nThis session began in a very tragic climate in the\r\nwake of the cowardly and ignoble acts orchestrated by\r\nenemies of international peace and security. Those\r\nterrorist acts led to the deaths of thousands of innocent\r\nvictims in the cities of New York and Washington. This\r\nwas a very heavy blow to the Government and the\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\npeople of the United States and also a challenge to the\r\nUnited Nations and to the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Government of Rwanda learned of these\r\nignoble acts with indignation and consternation, and\r\nhas presented its condolences to the American\r\nGovernment and the families directly affected. The\r\nRwandan Government reiterates its condemnation of\r\nterrorism and remains open to all initiatives designed\r\nto combat all forms of terrorism. It is in this spirit that\r\nmy country unreservedly supports all the resolutions\r\nadopted against terrorism, in particular resolution 1373\r\n(2001) of 28 September, and we reaffirm our\r\ndetermination to implement them.\r\nThe acts of 11 September 2001 are a challenge to\r\nthe United Nations and to each of its Member States.\r\nSince the United Nations is the crucible of international\r\npeace and security, and since terrorist groups take\r\ninnocent human lives, it is up to every Member State,\r\nevery truly human organization and every person who\r\ncherishes peace and justice to fight as vigorously as\r\npossible against such a terrorist group, no matter what\r\nits pretext, no matter how powerful it may be. When\r\nwe say no matter how powerful, we know what we are\r\nsaying, having been victims ourselves.\r\nWe were victims of the terror not of just any\r\norganization, but of a State that in reality became a\r\nnon-State, but with all the State machinery available to\r\nit to fight the very people whose protection was its\r\nmost fundamental duty. Rwanda and its people lived\r\nunder the terror of a murderous, terrorist and genocidal\r\nState for three months. This reign of terror by a State,\r\nas the Assembly well knows, took more than 1 million\r\nhuman lives in 1994. The instruments of this blind,\r\nmerciless terror, whose overwhelming result was\r\ngenocide, are well known: the organization of\r\nparamilitary militias commonly known as the\r\nInterahamwe, and the former Rwandese Armed Forces,\r\nknown as the ex-FAR. From this rostrum we call for\r\nthese two organizations, which for a decade have been\r\nveritable killing machines, to be duly listed as terrorist\r\ngroups to be fought and pursued throughout the world.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which\r\nsince 1994 has been harbouring these forces of evil,\r\nhas fed them, has provided them with arms and\r\nmunitions and has allied itself with them, must respond\r\nto the Security Council’s repeated appeals to stop all\r\nsupport for the negative forces on its territories,\r\nincluding the Interahamwe and ex-Far, which planned\r\nand carried out genocide in Rwanda.\r\nWith regard to peace in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo and throughout the Great Lakes region in\r\nAfrica, my country is determined to implement the\r\nLusaka Agreement, which, with respect to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, has two important\r\ncomponents: the inter-Congolese dialogue, which\r\nshould lead to a political solution to the Congolese\r\ncrisis, and the disarmament and withdrawal of negative\r\nforces, which should lead to peace on the Rwandan,\r\nUgandan and Burundi borders of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nWe wish to note with great satisfaction, the\r\nactions of the sisterly Republic of South Africa, which,\r\ngiven the failure of inter-Congolese dialogue in Addis\r\nAbaba — because of, among other things, lack of\r\nfinancial resources — generously offered food and\r\nlodging to over 300 Congolese delegates going to that\r\ngreatly anticipated inter-Congolese forum. We wish\r\nalso to congratulate the Rassemblement congolais pour\r\nla démocratie (RCD)-Goma and the Mouvement pour\r\nla libération du Congo (MLC)-Gbadolite on their fine\r\ninitiative to create a special force to carry out the\r\ndisarmament and disengagement of negative forces\r\nunder their control on the territory of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, and on having invited the\r\nKinshasa Government to join this initiative.\r\nRegarding human rights, we would like to\r\nreaffirm our attachment to the rule of law in\r\ninternational relations. We are determined to strengthen\r\nthe rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms. The Government of Rwanda\r\nwelcomed with great interest the report on human\r\nrights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is\r\nregrettable, however, that the Special Rapporteur,\r\nMr. Roberto Garretón, was not present when the report\r\nwas submitted on 8 November 2001. Because of his\r\nabsence, no real debate between the parties concerned\r\nand the Rapporteur was possible. Once again, my\r\ndelegation finds this highly regrettable.\r\nThe report on human rights in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo contains numerous gratuitous\r\nallegations, including one on the alleged annexation of\r\nthat country. We would like to recall here that the\r\nregular Rwandan army did not cross borders into the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in order to annex\r\nthe country, as the report claims, but, as we have\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nexplained and demonstrated a number of times, to\r\nensure the security of our territory and our population.\r\nWe acted in the context “of the inherent right of\r\nindividual ... self-defence” of a country, as we are\r\nauthorized to do under Chapter VII, Article 51 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nIndeed, security in the north of Rwanda has been\r\nand continues to be constantly disrupted by the ex-FAR\r\nand the Interahamwe militia that committed the\r\ngenocide in 1994 and that are using Congolese territory\r\nas their rear base in order to repeat their gruesome\r\ndeeds. These armed groups are infiltrating Rwanda and\r\nkilling thousands of innocent people. We hope that\r\nphase III of the United Nations Organization Mission\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC),\r\nin close cooperation with the initiative of the RCD\r\nGoma-MLC Gbadolite, will lead to the complete\r\ndisarmament of these groups and to stability and peace\r\nin the Great Lakes region.\r\nWe are pleased to note the establishment of a\r\nTransitional Government in Burundi. We believe that\r\nthis is a major step towards the reconciliation to which\r\nour brothers, the people of Burundi, aspire. Today the\r\nGreat Lakes region is seeking solutions to the conflicts\r\nthat undermine it. May the example of Burundi, under\r\nthe inspiration of President Nelson Mandela, bear fruit\r\nin the general interest and for the benefit of the people\r\nof Burundi and Africa as a whole.\r\nAlso regarding Africa, we feel that a definitive\r\nsolution to the problem of Western Sahara should also\r\nbe found.\r\nWe would like to see peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe question of Palestinian refugees, which is several\r\ndecades old, needs to be re-examined. Indeed, the\r\nexistence of an independent Palestinian State,\r\nalongside an independent Israeli State assured of its\r\nexistence as such is necessary for peace in the Middle\r\nEast. The friends of the Israelis and the Palestinians\r\nwithin the United Nations, including us, ought rather at\r\nthis stage to work on cultivating and strengthening\r\nrelations of friendship and cooperation between these\r\ntwo fraternal States — the Israeli State and the\r\nPalestinian State. We are anxious to start work on this\r\nnoble task.\r\nAside from Africa and the Middle East, we are\r\npleased to note the significant progress made on the\r\nKorean peninsula, where both Koreas have shown\r\nencouraging signs of reaching a final settlement of a\r\nconflict arose in the context of the cold war.\r\nThis fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\r\nis the first after the Millennium Summit, and thus\r\nshould follow it up and lay the new foundation for the\r\nfuture of mankind. The Summit stressed, among the\r\nvalues that underpin international relations and respect\r\nfor the fundamental principles of the Charter, the role\r\nthat the United Nations ought to play and\r\nrecommended the creation of a propitious climate for\r\nthe development of the least developed countries that\r\nwere not yet on the path towards globalization.\r\nThroughout this general debate poverty and the\r\nproblem of debt have been stressed as major obstacles\r\nto development and thus to entry into the era of\r\nglobalization. Globalization, with its advantages for\r\nsome and problems for others, does not seem to be able\r\nto resolve the problem of the gap between the rich and\r\npoor countries. To the contrary, the gap between them\r\ncontinues to grow. The marginalization of poor\r\ncountries in international trade and the debt burden\r\nhave severely hampered their efforts for development\r\nand have exacerbated their poverty. This is why the\r\nUnited Nations needs to define policies for the\r\ndevelopment of all and adopt international measures to\r\nsupport poor countries in the field of investment. Such\r\nmeasures should also be aimed at cancelling debt and\r\nensuring adequate integration of these countries into\r\nthe world economy.\r\nIn this context, we call on the United Nations to\r\nreconsider the report submitted to the Security Council\r\nby the Independent Inquiry led by Mr. Carlsson, former\r\nPrime Minister of Sweden, on which there has been no\r\nfollow-up to date. As a Member of the United Nations,\r\nwe believe that the Organization to which we belong\r\nshould undertake a follow-up to this report that defines\r\nwell the need for economic and social reconstruction in\r\npost-genocide Rwanda.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Enele Sopoaga, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Sopoaga (Tuvalu): I am honoured to address\r\nthe General Assembly. Speaking on behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of Tuvalu, I extend\r\nTuvalu’s greetings to the Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession and our congratulations to the President and the\r\nVice-Presidents of the Assembly on their election. I\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nalso pledge Tuvalu’s full support and cooperation\r\nduring their term of office.\r\nAs we come to the end of this general debate, we\r\nare still overshadowed by the loss of many innocent\r\nlives and property as the result of the barbaric terrorist\r\nattack on America in September. We are further\r\nsaddened by the losses earlier this week resulting from\r\nthe plane accident in our host state, New York, and our\r\nhost country, America. Tuvalu therefore joins others in\r\nreiterating to the people and Government of America\r\nour strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks and our\r\npledge of strong solidarity with the United States of\r\nAmerica.\r\nLet me also convey Tuvalu’s deepest sorrow and\r\nsympathy to the families of the victims of the plane\r\ncrash, and offer our prayers to the people and\r\nGovernment of America, and equally to the people and\r\nGovernment of the Dominican Republic. We wholly\r\nshare their bereavement and grief.\r\nAs the newest Member of the United Nations,\r\nhaving joined on the eve of the historic Millennium\r\nSummit last year, Tuvalu is more than ever aware of its\r\nresponsibilities to the United Nations and what the\r\nOrganization stands for. In June this year, Tuvalu\r\nestablished its Permanent Mission here in New York.\r\nAlthough this has been costly, Tuvalu believes the cost\r\nis offset by what the United Nations stands for. Our\r\npresence in the General Assembly reflects a basic\r\nbelief we hold true: that the United Nations, through its\r\nenfranchising activities, can help Tuvalu and other\r\ncountries like us by being an advocate with regard to\r\nthe issues that concern us most.\r\nTuvalu is proud that the Nobel Peace Prize for\r\n2001 was awarded to our Secretary-General and the\r\nUnited Nations itself. This award is a telling\r\nrecognition of the vast contributions the United\r\nNations has made in so many fields and on so many\r\nfronts: to peace around the world; to the protection of\r\nthe individual, no matter his or her origin or\r\ncircumstances; and to the upholding of the basic United\r\nNations principle that every human being should have\r\nevery opportunity to lead a better and more fulfilling\r\nlife. We congratulate the Secretary-General and the\r\nOrganization for this recognition.\r\nThere is no doubt in Tuvalu that peace and\r\nstability are indispensable to the well-being of\r\nfreedom-loving people everywhere. The world cannot\r\nignore threats to peace and stability, no matter what\r\ntheir causes may be, be they economic, social or\r\nenvironmental. The terrorist attacks in the United\r\nStates of America and what has happened around the\r\nworld since 11 September have made those of us here\r\nin this great Hall today feel very anxious. However, the\r\nvery cause of this anxiety points clearly to the proper\r\nrole of the United Nations. The General Assembly\r\nmust be a strong advocate of what the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in his new road map, calls a new “culture of\r\nprevention”.\r\nIn our view, pursuit of this new culture is worthy\r\nand must take advantage of the new spirit of\r\ncooperation that is now emerging to facilitate the\r\nelimination of the causes of terrorism and threats to\r\npeace and stability. In this regard, it is imperative to\r\naddress problems in an open and representative\r\ndialogue based on consensus and mutual respect and\r\nunderstanding.\r\nThe consensus-building approach that we in the\r\nPacific region often call the “Pacific way” may well\r\nprove useful in our collective venture for universal\r\ncooperation. Tuvalu is committed to its obligation to\r\nadhere to the United Nations resolutions to eliminate\r\nterrorism, and thus is taking steps to accede to the 12\r\nUnited Nations and international conventions on\r\nterrorism. But to honour such obligations in practice is\r\neasier said than done. We need technical and financial\r\nsupport from the international community to build up\r\nour legislative, surveillance and enforcement tools if\r\nwe are to have any hope of meeting these obligations\r\nbeyond our present capabilities.\r\nAlso, we must not lose sight of the need for\r\nstrong coalitions to deal with other pressing global\r\nissues, including conflicts and wars; the challenges of\r\nglobalization; poverty and underdevelopment; and the\r\neffects of environmental degradation and climate\r\nchange.\r\nUniversal cooperation against threats to peace\r\nand stability cannot, however, be fully achieved as long\r\nas the United Nations lacks the will to recognize fair\r\nand just representation within it of a democratic and\r\neconomically developed State with a population of 23\r\nmillion. The Republic of China on Taiwan is also\r\nsuffering in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist\r\nattacks, having lost innocent lives as well as property.\r\nLike us, they suffer from the onslaught of natural\r\ndisasters; epidemics and diseases, including the HIV/\r\nAIDS pandemic; and other threats of instability.\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nYet in all these crises, and despite their enormous\r\ncontribution to the world economy and international\r\ndevelopment — including technological\r\nadvancement — as well as their consistent\r\ndemonstration of international responsibility, the\r\npeople of the Republic of China on Taiwan have been\r\nleft to fend for themselves, denied the right to proper\r\nrepresentation and collaboration, not only in the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies, such as the World\r\nHealth Organization, but in nearly every other\r\nintergovernmental body. The voice with which they\r\ncould share their plight and thereby benefit from world\r\ncooperation is silenced. However, the irony is that for\r\nmore than 50 years, no authority other than the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan itself has had full\r\nsovereign control over Taiwan, its population and the\r\nrunning of its affairs. To visit the country, for example,\r\none must have immigration papers issued by its own\r\nauthorities.\r\nWhile we welcome the wise decision of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization last week to admit the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, it is Tuvalu’s strong\r\nview that the United Nations must take the lead and\r\nseriously reconsider United Nations membership for\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, beyond the politics\r\nof exclusion and on the basis of the reality of things.\r\nIn Tuvalu and many other countries in the Pacific,\r\nwe know that our economic vulnerability is fertile\r\nground for forces of terror that can threaten the security\r\nand survival not only of the islands, but also of the\r\nregion and the world. We are worried about the\r\ngrowing global interdependence and what that may\r\nbring to our shores. We need to improve our ability to\r\nshare and disseminate information on transnational\r\ncrimes, particularly those involving drug trafficking,\r\nmoney laundering, bogus investments, and other\r\ndangerous and dubious schemes that often arrive in the\r\nPacific islands under the pretext of being legitimate.\r\nWe believe that, if we are left on our own, these\r\nthreats will continue to expose Tuvalu and other Pacific\r\nisland countries to forces outside our control. It is vital,\r\ntherefore, that individual Pacific island Governments\r\nbe given the back-up that is needed to boost their\r\nability to tackle security threats and fight crime. The\r\nexisting regional security arrangements under the\r\nPacific Islands Forum and its sister regional agencies\r\nin the Pacific can, indeed, play a vital role. However,\r\nthey need to be further strengthened to enable them to\r\ncomplement national security efforts more effectively.\r\nFurther solidifying of cooperation between our regional\r\norganizations and the United Nations, moreover, is\r\nfundamental to the success of national and regional\r\nefforts vital for regional and global security.\r\nI should like to add here that Tuvalu highly\r\ncommends the role played by the United Nations and\r\nother international organizations and major countries in\r\nhelping restore peace in the Pacific following the\r\nrecent turbulence in the region.\r\nTuvalu is not in a good position to take advantage\r\nof the opportunities offered by trade liberalization.\r\nLike many island countries, Tuvalu currently lacks the\r\nknow-how, trained people and adequate infrastructure\r\nto reap the benefits that are enjoyed here. If there is\r\nbenefit for Tuvalu in a free trade world — and we\r\nbelieve there is — then surely Tuvalu must have in\r\nplace the means that would allow us to reap that\r\nbenefit.\r\nIn more ways than one, small island developing\r\nStates such as Tuvalu are at the sharp end, the cutting\r\nedge, of development. For us, overseas development\r\naid is indispensable to the development and sustenance\r\nof basic services necessary for security and survival.\r\nOur priorities continue to be education, health services\r\nand fresh water.\r\nWhile we commend with great appreciation the\r\ngenerosity of our development partners, particularly\r\nour traditional partners, it has to be noted that Tuvalu\r\nand other small island developing States, like the\r\nlandlocked and least developed countries and other\r\ndeveloping countries, will for some time continue to\r\nrely on external financing through official development\r\nassistance to address their unique development needs.\r\nIn our view, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, both of which will be held\r\nnext year, must also capitalize on the premises laid out\r\nunder the reviewed Barbados Programme of Action for\r\nthe Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States, the outcome of the United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries and the\r\nSecretary-General’s road map towards the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration as the key tools to address the unique\r\ncircumstances and vulnerabilities of small island\r\ndeveloping States. Ultimately, this must lead to more\r\neffective delivery of assistance that is flexible and\r\nmore responsive to the sustainable development needs\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nof small island developing States and of developing\r\ncountries in general.\r\nWith limited exploitable resources, Tuvalu, like\r\nmany other small island developing States, relies\r\nheavily on the surrounding seas for its food security\r\nand economic development. The proper protection of\r\nthe oceans from hazardous pollution is therefore vital,\r\nand the sustainable management and exploitation of\r\nfisheries and other marine resources is extremely\r\nimportant to our sustainable development and survival.\r\nBuilding local capacity to conserve, manage and\r\nharvest marine resources in a sustainable manner is\r\ncrucial and should therefore be supported.\r\nAs has already been said in this debate, the\r\nbiggest long-term threat to the people of Tuvalu is\r\nposed by the effects of climate change, in particular\r\nrising sea levels. Recent reports released by the\r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have\r\nconfirmed beyond doubt the correlation between\r\naccelerated atmospheric warming and sea-level rise. In\r\nTuvalu too it is our strong belief that the weather is\r\ngrowing more severe, hotter and drier, and that there\r\nhave been unusually high seas eroding foreshores and\r\nintruding into freshwater lenses. We believe that the\r\ncumulative effect of carbon dioxide emissions in\r\nindustrial and other countries into the atmosphere has,\r\nin sum, created a future that is very uncertain in\r\nTuvalu.\r\nIt may not be known in this Hall but unique\r\nwithin the United Nations membership are the\r\nMaldives, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu.\r\nThose four countries are the only Member States that\r\nconsist entirely of low-lying coral atolls and reef\r\nislands. In the event of further rising sea levels, where\r\nare we to hide? Eventually asking countries to take us\r\nin as environmental refugees is not what Tuvalu is after\r\nin the long run. What we prefer is that our great-\r\ngrandchildren should grow up the way I did and the\r\nway my wife and our brothers and sisters did in our\r\nisland communities, learning the traditions, customs\r\nand culture of Tuvalu, and living our way of life.\r\nTuvalu is not alone in sharing that view. Tens of\r\nmillions of people who live on islands or in coastal\r\ncommunities face the gloomy onslaught of rising sea\r\nlevels. Such vulnerable geography is everywhere. How\r\nironic it would be if decades from now the last Member\r\nto enter the United Nations, Tuvalu, were the first\r\nMember State to withdraw because it had disappeared\r\nwithout a trace.\r\nIn the shrinking world we live in, environmental\r\npollution has never known artificial boundaries. The\r\npresence of higher than normal levels of greenhouse\r\ngases in the atmosphere is a legacy of development in\r\nindustrial countries spanning the past 200 years. I hope\r\nthat industrial countries realize that nature is now\r\nimposing a penalty for that development.\r\nUnfortunately, it is Tuvalu and others with little or\r\nnothing to do with the causes which are now forced to\r\npay.\r\nWhile we are heartened by the positive outcome\r\nof the seventh Conference of the Parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\r\nheld at Marrakesh, and while we are looking forward to\r\nthe full implementation of that Convention and of the\r\nKyoto Protocol commitments, we would also hope that\r\ngoodwill will prevail beyond instruments and\r\nconventions to assist those most affected to adapt to the\r\nimmediate and long-term effects of climate change.\r\nThis is not the time to shrink from environmental\r\nand survival responsibility. Like the international war\r\nbeing waged against terrorism, a global solution to the\r\nthreat posed by climate change and sea-level rise will\r\nsave Tuvalu and many other small island States from\r\ndisappearing. Our collective resolve to remove causes\r\nof terrorism and threats to peace and security, including\r\npoverty and underdevelopment, HIV/AIDS and\r\nenvironmental degradation, will ensure a truly peaceful\r\nand secure village for all of humanity.\r\nMay God bless the United Nations; may God\r\nbless its peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Amraiya Naidu, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Fiji.\r\nMr. Naidu (Fiji): Fiji mourns the recent losses\r\nand world-changing tragedies which the United States\r\nof America has endured. We remember the many lives\r\nlost in that adversity, and we express the hope that\r\npeace and goodwill may prevail. Now is the time to\r\nmake haste to galvanize collaborative efforts by\r\ndeveloped and developing nations in the global fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nWe congratulate His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo and the Government of the Republic of Korea on\r\nAmbassador Han’s assumption of the presidency of the\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. We pledge\r\ncomplete support during his term of office, fully aware\r\nthat the qualities that have marked his eminent and\r\ndistinguished career promise a resounding conclusion\r\nto the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\r\ndespite its difficult start.\r\nFitting tribute is also due to his predecessor,\r\nMr. Harri Holkeri of Finland. His leadership over the\r\nprevious year successfully concluded a truly hectic and\r\nfull schedule of business, including some difficult\r\nissues and special sessions during the period of the\r\nfifty-fifth session. He leaves an indelible mark in the\r\nannals of the United Nations.\r\nMy Government congratulates His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan on his appointment as Secretary-\r\nGeneral for a second term; this signifies the trust and\r\nconfidence that the United Nations places in him. He\r\nhas aptly been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which\r\nhe shares with the United Nations. Fiji welcomes the\r\nroad map he has outlined for the Organization, which,\r\nunder his creative and competent leadership, will\r\ndeliver the reforms needed to launch the Organization\r\ninto the twenty-first century.\r\nIn the wake of the political crisis that triggered\r\ninstability in Fiji in 2000, my Government set itself\r\ntwo immediate tasks: to restore constitutional\r\ndemocracy and to stabilize our fragile economy. Those\r\ngoals are being achieved. Moreover, my Government is\r\ncontinuing to pursue strong economic performance\r\nthrough increased investment and development.\r\nI am honoured to inform the Assembly that, only\r\n18 months after its political crisis, Fiji successfully\r\nconcluded the general elections and formed a\r\nmultiparty Government in September 2001. My\r\nGovernment is confident that, with the support of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community, Fiji’s\r\nforward-looking policies will steer it ahead on a path of\r\ndemocratic rule and sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFiji acknowledges the support rendered to us by\r\nthe United Nations and by Member States in the\r\ndeployment of the United Nations electoral observation\r\nteam during our elections. The team discharged its\r\nduties professionally and impartially. We are confident\r\nthat it will provide the Assembly with a positive\r\nappraisal of the conduct of the elections as free and\r\nfair — conduct to which we have been well\r\naccustomed throughout our electoral history.\r\nI should like to convey my Government’s deep\r\ngratitude to those Member States that supported Fiji\r\nand to those that sponsored resolution 55/280, which\r\nenabled the participation of the United Nations\r\nobserver team.\r\nOur leaders are committed, under the Millennium\r\nDeclaration of 2000, to the principles of human dignity,\r\nequality and equity, especially with respect to those\r\nwho are most vulnerable, in particular the children,\r\nwho are our future. It is a timely and constructive\r\ncommitment that creates the necessary global\r\nframework for addressing the plight of the poor and the\r\nvulnerable in the face of the accelerating impact of\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization.\r\nPoverty is at the root of many problems. As the\r\nmost powerful destabilizing force, it threatens\r\ndemocracy and good governance. It is thus our most\r\ninsidious enemy. Successive Human Development\r\nReports amply document abysmal accounts of poverty\r\nand poverty indicators. A total of 1.2 billion people\r\nlive on less than $1 a day, more than a billion people in\r\ndeveloping countries lack access to safe water, and\r\nmore than 2.4 billion people lack adequate sanitation.\r\nWe are talking not millions, but billions.\r\nPoverty reduction is therefore our greatest\r\nchallenge today. The Millennium Declaration set a\r\ntarget to halve global extreme poverty by 2015. This\r\ngoal must be the cornerstone of all development\r\nefforts. It demands an ongoing commitment and\r\neffective measures on the part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn this connection, my Government has created a\r\nnew Ministry for Poverty Alleviation, which is a key\r\npolicy factor in our triennial Strategic Development\r\nPlan. We recognize that economic, social and political\r\nstability are inextricably tied to reducing the gap\r\nbetween rich and poor. That equation must also\r\nrecognize the unique vulnerabilities that beset the\r\nfragile economies of developing countries such as Fiji.\r\nComplementary legislation is also being\r\ndeveloped in the Social Justice Bill to translate into\r\npolicy the constitutional provision for social equity.\r\nPrimarily, the Bill will regulate affirmative action\r\npolicies for disadvantaged groups in the areas and in\r\nthe manner prescribed in the Fiji Constitution. This is a\r\ncritical step in Fiji’s efforts towards national unity and\r\nnation-building and its efforts to address issues of\r\nsocial, ethnic and economic development and harmony.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nToday, in our journey in this world, we are\r\nmeeting with unprecedented challenges and\r\nuncertainties, ranging from widespread global conflict\r\nto escalating terrorist activities and economic\r\nmarginalization. The Assembly and the United Nations\r\nsystem must devise appropriate, creative responses to\r\nthese difficult questions, in ways that are compatible\r\nwith the goals of world peace and security, as\r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter.\r\nCurrent organizational reform plans present\r\nconstructive and necessary platforms for meeting these\r\nspecific challenges. An amicable agreement on the\r\nexpansion of the permanent or non-permanent\r\nmembership of the Security Council could well present\r\nus with new and fresh avenues for solutions. My\r\ndelegation reiterates our full support for an expansion\r\nof both membership categories of the Security Council.\r\nWe congratulate the Security Council on the support\r\nthat its landmark resolution 1325 (2000) received, a\r\nresolution whose implementation will allow for\r\nincreased involvement on the part of women in the\r\nprocess of achieving peace and security.\r\nFiji has excelled in its efforts to achieve the\r\npeacekeeping goals of the United Nations Charter. We\r\nremain fully committed to this goal and to the Brahimi\r\nrecommendations for reform. Our military is serving in\r\nvarious United Nations missions, including in Lebanon,\r\nEast Timor and Kuwait. Our police officers are serving\r\nin Bosnia and Kosovo. It is gratifying to see positive\r\nconclusions to several peacekeeping mandates and their\r\nimpending withdrawal or downsizing. We would\r\ncaution, however, against any exit without strategy, in\r\norder to give credence to the huge investment of\r\ngoodwill and resources by the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community, and to avoid a situation of\r\ndouble jeopardy for the people trapped in armed\r\nconflict.\r\nIn this regard, we support new measures to\r\nstrengthen the protective regime of the Convention on\r\nthe Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel.\r\nIts scope needs to include United Nations and\r\nhumanitarian personnel on the ground, who need real\r\nprotection and security while working to ensure the\r\nsafety of, and caring for, civilians.\r\nFiji has consistently advocated decolonization\r\nand self-determination since joining the United\r\nNations. We note the delay in the implementation of\r\nthe Declaration on the Granting of Independence to\r\nColonial Countries and Peoples. Fiji supports the\r\nongoing work of the Committee of 24 and recognizes\r\nthe political and diplomatic constraints involved.\r\nEarly on in this Second Decade for the\r\nEradication of Colonialism, the 17 Non-Self-Governing\r\nTerritories, mostly small island Territories in the\r\nCaribbean and Pacific regions, need our focused\r\nattention, so that their legitimate aspirations for self-\r\ndetermination can be recognized.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment on the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic demands that we exercise greater\r\nvigilance and focus sincerely on safeguarding our\r\ndevelopment gains and on our future goals. We in the\r\nPacific are seeking to maintain our low infection rate\r\ntrend, as we stand to lose the most if we fail to abide\r\nby that Declaration. Only collaboration and solidarity\r\nat the international, regional and national levels can\r\nsave humanity from this invasive scourge.\r\nDespite the recent political disturbances in Fiji,\r\nrespect for the rule of law and for international human\r\nrights standards has been maintained. The continued\r\nexistence and independence of the Fiji Human Rights\r\nCommission is testimony to our commitment to human\r\nrights.\r\nFiji, along with several of its Pacific Island\r\nneighbours, is for the first time facing the dilemmas\r\nposed by refugees and asylum seekers. International\r\nhuman trafficking has brought them to our shores,\r\ndespite the vast distances between our lands.\r\nInternational refugees are the direct result of violations\r\nand breaches of human rights. As a State party to the\r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and to its\r\nProtocol, Fiji pleads with Member States to respect the\r\nrights of refugees and to support the work of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees. At the very\r\nleast, Member States are obligated to protect the rights\r\nof their citizens in their own homeland.\r\nFiji co-sponsored the resolution on Korean peace,\r\nsecurity and reunification during the fifty-fifth session\r\nof the General Assembly. We are elated to see peace\r\nand reunification initiatives in the Korean peninsula.\r\nLikewise, the small island developing States are\r\nseeking continually to enhance our international\r\nparticipation. Strengthening future relations between\r\nthe United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum is a\r\nmutually beneficial avenue. This will allow for our\r\neffective participation in the United Nations system. It\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nalso affords the United Nations with a unique and\r\nauthentic Pacific perspective and voice. Cooperation\r\nbetween the Pacific Islands Forum and the United\r\nNations is a welcome addition to this session’s agenda\r\nand promises greater returns, with the support of\r\nMember States.\r\nOur Pacific Islands Forum leaders will meet in\r\nFiji in 2002. It is therefore opportune to renew our\r\ninvitation to Mr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, to\r\nvisit the Pacific Islands Forum region. Recent political\r\nevents in the Pacific and the successful domestic,\r\nregional and international initiatives to address these\r\nconcerns can only be positively reinforced by such a\r\nhigh-level, goodwill visit by the Secretary-General, to\r\ntake place early, rather than later, in his second term of\r\noffice.\r\nOur global development agenda demands of the\r\nUnited Nations an increased facilitating role in the\r\ncoordination of economic, financial, trade and social\r\nissues. At the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development in March 2002, stakeholders will\r\ndeliberate on enhancing coherence and coordination\r\nbetween development and social objectives. Fiji hopes\r\nthat the Conference will inspire the international\r\ncommunity and financial institutions, including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, to support and devise new\r\nstandards and indicators, such as the vulnerability\r\nindex, to effectively address poverty and other\r\ndisparities.\r\nGrowing imbalances and marginalization in the\r\nworld economy are a threat to humanity, in particular\r\nto Fiji and other small island developing States (SIDS).\r\nSustainable development depends on a given level of\r\nresources to propel our fragile economies forward.\r\nMoreover, these resources are needed to sustain long-\r\nterm, sound, economic and environmentally friendly\r\ndevelopment. The critical role of the international\r\ncommunity is to assist us in nation-building and\r\nefficient resource utilization so that we can fulfil our\r\nsocial obligations.\r\nFiji has long expounded to the international\r\ncommunity how vulnerable and heavily dependent our\r\neconomies are on the vagaries and whims of the global\r\neconomy. Our small size, extremely remote distance\r\nfrom the international markets and increasing\r\nsusceptibility to natural disasters do not lend\r\nthemselves well to economies of scale of production, to\r\nbuilding export-based trade or to gaining competitive\r\naccess to foreign markets for our products. Clearly, our\r\nability to benefit fully from globalization is doomed\r\nfrom the start, further aggravating the divide between\r\nthe rich and poor. It is my Government’s aspiration that\r\nthe scope of equitable and tangible benefits from\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization is still to be fully\r\nrealized if we are to meaningfully tackle global and\r\nhuman poverty.\r\nAs a member of the World Trade Organization,\r\nFiji is concerned at the fast erosion of trade preferences\r\nin the world trade in agricultural products, sugar being\r\na mainstay of our economy. Increasingly, we fear that\r\nsmall island States like my own, which depend\r\npredominantly on agricultural export commodities, will\r\nbe seriously affected without adequate market\r\nsafeguards. We are forced to question the efficacy of a\r\nmultilateral trade framework as a fair mechanism in\r\npromoting the interests of SIDS like Fiji.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the current work on\r\nfinancing for development and preparations for the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. Targeted\r\nassistance and official development assistance\r\nprogrammes to enable us to fully implement and\r\nstrengthen investment and productivity must\r\nnecessarily complement our efforts through regional or\r\nmultilateral trading agreements. We are optimistic that\r\nnext year’s high-level conferences will flag our\r\nconcerns in line with the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction and the development goals that are set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Mr. Patrick\r\nAlbert Lewis, Chairman of the delegation of Antigua\r\nand Barbuda.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): Antigua and\r\nBarbuda is pleased that this is the United Nations Year\r\nof Dialogue among Civilizations. However, we can\r\nhave meaningful dialogue only if the dominant\r\ncountries reach out with genuine understanding when\r\nothers speak. We can have dialogue only if the basic\r\nprinciples of the United Nations are made the core of\r\nreality. We cannot have dialogue if multilateralism\r\nremains selective or if the principle of rotation\r\ncontinues to be based on demographics, military might\r\nand economic principles. The people of my country\r\nrepresent an integral part of human civilization and we\r\nwish to contribute our voice and our ideas to the debate\r\non the future of the journey of humankind on this\r\nplanet.\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September in the host\r\ncountry of the United Nations have presented a\r\nchallenge to world civilization. The Parliament of\r\nAntigua and Barbuda on Thursday, 18 October, passed\r\nstrong anti-terrorism legislation. Also, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, meeting in special emergency session in\r\nthe Bahamas on 11 and 12 October, recognized\r\nterrorism as a global problem requiring a resolute\r\nglobal response. The heads of Government stated:\r\n“We are conscious that the unprecedented\r\nand barbaric terrorist assaults of 11 September\r\nwill require of us extraordinary vigilance and\r\ncoordination in the future, to ensure that our\r\nterritories, our institutions and our citizens are\r\nnot used in any manner to facilitate the activities\r\nof terrorists or to undermine our national and\r\nregional security.”\r\nWe share the agony of the United States, for we\r\ntoo had nationals who perished in the 11 September\r\natrocity. We fully support Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), which makes it obligatory for all States to\r\nimpose far-reaching measures to combat the scourge of\r\nterrorism. We support the work of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee. International terrorism is in\r\nreality an act of war against the world’s peace-loving\r\npeoples. It is imperative that all countries of the world\r\naddress in a more meaningful manner the underlying\r\nsocial, economic and political problems that cause\r\nhuman misery and perpetuate injustice. We must act to\r\nensure that the entire global society lives in an\r\nenvironment of freedom and is free from fear. The fight\r\nagainst terrorism will be a long and arduous one, but it\r\nis one in which we must thoroughly and completely\r\nengage ourselves.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda has now ratified the Rome\r\nStatute for the International Criminal Court. The\r\ncitizens of my country believe that in the prospect of an\r\ninternational criminal court lies the promise of\r\nuniversal justice, since the Court will have the power to\r\nindict individuals. Antigua and Barbuda is certainly\r\ndisappointed that crimes pertaining to drug trafficking\r\nand terrorism have been put on the back burner at the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, but we are prepared to\r\ncontinue our dialogue to bring them under the ambit of\r\nthe Court when it becomes active. The cancer of drug\r\ntrafficking will continue to threaten human civilization\r\nuntil we fashion a truly global response to its menace.\r\nThe battles in Seattle, Windsor and Quebec are an\r\nintegral part of world civilization’s struggle to\r\nhumanize globalization. Interestingly, we find\r\nourselves agreeing with the statement made by the\r\nManaging Director of the International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) in his address to members of the Deutsche\r\nBundestag on 2 April 2001 in Berlin. Mr. Köhler\r\ndeclared that it is political and economic madness for\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) countries to spend $360 billion a\r\nyear on agricultural subsidies, while poverty rages in\r\ndeveloping countries, especially in the rural and\r\nfarming regions. He went on to say that it is high time\r\nfor industrial countries to honour their commitment to\r\nprovide 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for\r\nofficial development assistance.\r\nAt the United Nations Millennium Summit, my\r\nown Prime Minister, Lester Bird, castigated the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment for its unilaterally devised set of\r\nstandards for international taxation to be imposed on\r\nother jurisdictions and for demanding that States\r\nchange their domestic laws to suit OECD purposes.\r\nThe rule of law has become the rule of the jungle,\r\nwhere rules do not apply, and only might is right. In\r\nreality, the OECD Harmful Tax Competition project\r\nhas nothing to do with money laundering, but has more\r\nto do with the fact that OECD believes that its member\r\nStates would lose capital to other States with more\r\ncompetitive tax regimes.\r\nGlobalization has left States like my own with a\r\nfeeling of exclusion, a feeling of being cast aside and\r\npushed outside, from where we observe the gains of the\r\ndominant. It is a feeling of not being able to participate\r\nin the determination of our own destiny. The “green\r\nroom” process evident at World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) ministerial meetings has done nothing but\r\nincrease our apprehension. We call for serious reform\r\nof the global political and economic architecture to be\r\nundertaken, both at the United Nations and at the\r\nWorld Trade Organization. The multilateral trading\r\nsystem needs to be transparent. It needs to be fair and\r\nequitable, and all countries should be able to share in\r\nits benefits.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, as a small island State, is\r\nextremely vulnerable to natural disasters. The most\r\nprevalent threat is that of hurricanes, three of which\r\nrecently impacted our sister States of Belize, Cuba and\r\nthe Bahamas. A single hurricane can set back the\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\ndevelopment of a small island State by 10 years.\r\nBetween 1995 and 2000, our beloved twin island State\r\nwas hit by seven hurricanes.\r\nWe call on the international community to\r\nacknowledge in a meaningful way the vulnerability of\r\nsmall States like Antigua and Barbuda. We point to our\r\nlack of capacity in financial and human resources to\r\nbounce back from natural disasters and from external\r\nshocks to its economy caused by economic recession in\r\nthe major economies of the world, which also happen\r\nto be our main trading partners. It is therefore\r\nimperative that we be able to continue to access\r\nconcessionary financing through the World Bank. Our\r\nsocial and economic development needs, including\r\ninfrastructure, seem not to register in the boardrooms\r\nof the international financial institutions.\r\nCountries like Antigua and Barbuda are viewed\r\nas middle income because of the per capita income\r\ncriterion, but this is a flawed measurement and should\r\nbe abandoned. Financing for development should take\r\ninto account a mix of factors and should be linked to\r\nthe vulnerability index on which the United Nations\r\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has\r\ndone important work.\r\nNo account is taken of the considerable\r\ntransaction costs faced by small States because of their\r\nremoteness and the disproportionate burden they bear\r\nin order to effectively participate in world trade. No\r\naccount is taken of the openness of our economy to\r\ngoods and services from all over the world, without\r\ncorresponding market access for our own limited range\r\nof goods to the markets of Europe and North America.\r\nAn inhospitable stranger known as “non-tariff barriers”\r\ncontinues to slam the door in our face.\r\nIn these circumstances, we cannot overemphasize\r\nhow important it is for the IMF and the World Bank to\r\napply special and differential treatment to measuring\r\nthe fiscal and economic performance of small island\r\nStates. Our limited capacity to raise revenue and our\r\nnecessity to spend at a disproportionate level in order\r\nto maintain a decent standard of living for our people\r\nshould lead the IMF to have special and differential\r\nprogrammes of assistance for small island States.\r\nThese programmes should not merely prescribe the\r\ntraditional formula of large-scale public sector\r\ndismissals and reduction of public sector investment\r\nprogrammes. Instead, innovative ways should be found\r\nto provide long-term financing at repayment periods\r\nand rates of interest that would allow small States to\r\nmaintain democracy, human rights, low crime rates and\r\neconomic growth.\r\nMy country welcomes the successful conclusion\r\nof the Marrakesh meeting on climate change, where the\r\nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention\r\non Climate Change finalized the operational details of\r\nthe Kyoto Protocol, thereby opening the way to\r\nwidespread ratification by Governments and the\r\nProtocol’s early entry into force. This was the result of\r\nseveral years of tough negotiation in which Antigua\r\nand Barbuda was very active and took a leadership\r\nposition. What we now have in place are the\r\ninstitutions and detailed procedures of the Kyoto\r\nProtocol, and the next step is to test their effectiveness\r\nin overseeing the five per cent cut in greenhouse gas\r\nemissions by developed countries over the next decade.\r\nThe agreements reached in Marrakesh also made\r\nimportant progress on strengthening the flow of\r\nfinancial and technological support to developing\r\ncountries so that they can move towards a sustainable\r\nenergy future. They also send a clear signal to\r\nbusiness, local governments and the general public that\r\nclimate-friendly products, services and activities will\r\nbe rewarded by consumers and national policies alike.\r\nThe meeting also adopted the Marrakesh\r\nMinisterial Declaration as an input into next\r\nSeptember’s World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Johannesburg. The\r\nDeclaration emphasizes the contribution that action on\r\nclimate change can make to sustainable development\r\nand calls for capacity building, technology innovation\r\nand cooperation with the Biodiversity and\r\nDesertification Conventions. With the Summit a little\r\nless than a year away, small island developing States\r\nsuch as my own, which are among the most vulnerable\r\nto the adverse effects of climate change, continue to\r\nurge the speedy ratification of the Protocol.\r\nThat will require a global coalition among States\r\nto ensure that it enters into force and becomes legally\r\nbinding after it has been ratified by at least 55 parties\r\nto the Convention, including the industrialized\r\ncountries that represent at least 55 per cent of the total\r\n1990 carbon dioxide emissions from this group. While\r\nit remains true that those with the highest per capita\r\nlevels of greenhouse gas emissions should take the\r\nlead, it is incumbent upon all countries to work\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\ntogether to ensure that there is full compliance with\r\ncommitments contained in the Protocol.\r\nThere is a deep concern in our countries, a\r\nconcern that takes on paramount proportions and that is\r\ncentred around the transhipment of nuclear waste\r\nthrough the waters of the Caribbean Sea, and which\r\nrepresents a blatant disregard of our sovereignty. The\r\ncountries of the Caribbean have insisted that it be\r\nstopped, but to no avail; and our populations live in\r\nconstant fear of an accident. We call on those who\r\nengage in this deadly traffic to respect the rights of\r\ntransit States such as Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nThe most populous democracy in the world,\r\nIndia, spoke on the first day of the general debate and\r\nhighlighted concerns that we find it necessary to\r\nreiterate. There needs to be a more determined\r\nmovement towards the liquidation of the external debts\r\nof low income and highly indebted countries. There\r\nshould be poverty alleviation programmes designed for\r\ncountries facing financial crises, and there should be\r\nstabilization of international prices of primary\r\ncommodity exports.\r\nThe measures that we have outlined here are\r\nessential to building a just and equitable international\r\norder. Anything less would simply be the imposition of\r\nthe will of the powerful upon the pusillanimous. All\r\nsocieties are measured by the way they treat their most\r\nvulnerable members, and the international community\r\nof nations is no different. I call on all representatives\r\nhere assembled to heed the plea of the victims and to\r\nconstruct an international order that can lift human\r\ncivilization to achieve the highest ideals of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Raynard Gideon, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of the Marshall Islands.\r\nMr. Gideon (Marshall Islands): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of the\r\nMarshall Islands allow me to offer cordial\r\ncongratulations to the President on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession, and to offer the Marshall Islands unreserved\r\ncooperation in our deliberations at this session.\r\nI must also express my sincere gratitude to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri, whose outstanding\r\nleadership was instrumental in making the fifty-fifth\r\nsession, coined the Millennium Assembly, highly\r\nsuccessful.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands also pays\r\ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan on his re-election to a second\r\nterm as Secretary-General, as well as on winning the\r\nprestigious Nobel Peace Prize, which is a very well-\r\ndeserved and timely recognition of the Organization\r\nand of the Secretary-General’s wisdom and dedication\r\nto the service of mankind.\r\nIt is with a heavy heart and deep sorrow that the\r\nGovernment of President Kessai Note and the people of\r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands reiterate to the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States of\r\nAmerica their deepest sympathy and condolences for\r\nthe suffering and pain caused by the terrorist attacks of\r\n11 September. Similarly, we wish to convey our\r\nheartfelt sympathy and condolences to the other great\r\nnations that were directly affected by that tragic and\r\ninhuman act. They were not alone in their daily trials\r\nand tribulations; the Republic of the Marshall Islands\r\nwas with them. Furthermore, we extend our solidarity\r\nand condolences to the Government and people of the\r\nDominican Republic, who suffered losses in the recent\r\ncrash of American Airlines flight 587.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns\r\nall acts of terrorism. I am pleased to inform the\r\nAssembly of the ratification by the Government of the\r\nMarshall Islands of six conventions and treaties related\r\nto terrorism. They are the Convention on the Physical\r\nProtection of Nuclear Material, the Convention on the\r\nPrevention and Punishment of Crimes against\r\nInternationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic\r\nAgents, the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, the Convention for\r\nthe Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the\r\nConvention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for\r\nthe Purpose of Detection, and the International\r\nConvention against the Taking of Hostages.\r\nThe marked worldwide increase in behaviours\r\nabhorrent to human dignity, freedom and basic rights of\r\ninnocent people encouraged the early ratification of the\r\nRome Statute by the Marshall Islands, which calls for\r\nthe establishment of an International Criminal Court.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands welcomes an\r\nearly establishment of the Court and the\r\nimplementation of its mandate.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands remains\r\nfully committed to the principles enshrined in the\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nhuman rights bill. The Government is currently in the\r\nprocess of ratifying the following conventions: the\r\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman\r\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the\r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Racial Discrimination; the United Nations\r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and\r\nCultural Rights; and the International Covenant on\r\nCivil and Political Rights. We are committed to accede\r\nto them in a timely manner.\r\nGiven the unique conditions under which we seek\r\nour livelihood, our Government has been readily\r\nsupportive of new scientific breakthroughs and\r\ninnovations for the betterment of the world. However,\r\nwe feel there are certain scientific initiatives that run\r\ncounter to human decency. In this regard, we fully\r\nassociate ourselves with the call by the Governments of\r\nGermany and of France for a universal convention\r\nbanning human cloning for reproductive purposes. We\r\nbelieve that such a scientific endeavour would directly\r\nviolate the Universal Declaration on the Human\r\nGenome and Human Rights, drawn up by the United\r\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization and endorsed by the General Assembly in\r\nresolution 53/152. Article 11 of that Declaration\r\nspecifies that\r\n“Practices which are contrary to human dignity,\r\nsuch as reproductive cloning of human beings,\r\nshall not be permitted.”\r\nAs in the past, the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands will continue to voice in the strongest terms\r\npossible and in the best form at its disposal, its\r\nconcerns and fears over issues relating to climate\r\nchange and rising sea levels. The Assembly is aware\r\nthat several Pacific island countries are represented in\r\nthis Organization. Like other small island countries, the\r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands is plagued by a unique\r\nset of problems. Our coastal zones have become highly\r\nvulnerable to erosion, our groundwater systems are\r\naffected by high levels of saltwater intrusion, and\r\nincreasing salinity is having a direct impact on our\r\nsubsistence cropping. Such vulnerabilities, together\r\nwith prolonged drought, constitute a deadly peril for\r\nour health and survival.\r\nWe welcome the successful outcome of the sixth\r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change,\r\nwhich recently concluded in Marrakesh. The Kyoto\r\nProtocol is the best available solution to address our\r\nenvironmental concerns. We should be able to look\r\nback in the coming days and commend ourselves for\r\nthe mission that is to be accomplished. We owe it to\r\nour children and to our children’s children.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, adopted by heads of\r\nState or Government during the Millennium Assembly,\r\nshould serve as our guiding framework and road map\r\nfor achieving sustainable development, eradicating\r\npoverty, combating HIV/AIDS, preventing illegal\r\ntrafficking in small arms and safeguarding the\r\nenvironment.\r\nImmediately following the Millennium Assembly,\r\nPresident Kessai H. Note convened a broad-based\r\neconomic and social summit, the outcome of which\r\nwas the development of a national planning vision — a\r\nguiding framework for a long-term national\r\ndevelopment programme. I commend Member States\r\nfor their generous support and assistance for this\r\ninitiative.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands is of the view that the United Nations must\r\nmove forward proactively in its reform process. We\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his reform\r\nprogramme. However, much more needs to be done.\r\nWe encourage the Fifth Committee and United Nations\r\nfunds and programmes to support and cooperate in the\r\nreform process.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands fully supports the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories, based on equity, to include developed and\r\ndeveloping countries so as to respond to the realities\r\nand challenges of our contemporary world. We note\r\nthat certain issues need to be agreed on. We should\r\nmove forward with broad-based agreement and revisit\r\nour differences.\r\nNow that this Organization has 189 Member\r\nStates, 14 of them being from the Pacific region, the\r\nreconfiguration of our electoral groupings should be an\r\nadditional matter to be placed on the table. It may be a\r\ncomplex issue, but through our collective efforts and\r\ninspiration, the goal can be achieved, and it should be\r\nconsidered without further delay.\r\nThe exclusion from this body and its related\r\nagencies of the Republic of China on Taiwan is a\r\nmajor, serious hindrance to the Government of the\r\n32\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan in its pursuit of its\r\nfundamental rights to participate in international\r\ndialogue and regional organizations and activities. The\r\ntime has come once again to reconsider the exclusion\r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan from this\r\nprestigious body. There is so much that the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan could do, in cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations system, in the areas of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, technology, health, peace and prosperity.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands pledges its commitment to the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nGod bless the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Claude Morel, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Seychelles.\r\nMr. Morel (Seychelles): My delegation would\r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Han on his dynamic\r\nstewardship of the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly at this session. Our felicitations also go to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and the United\r\nNations on being honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThe brutal and tragic events that took place in\r\nNew York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania on 11\r\nSeptember were the result of acts against not only the\r\nUnited States, but the international community at large.\r\nIn his message of condolence to President George\r\nW. Bush, the President of the Republic of Seychelles,\r\nMr. France Albert René, condemned the terrorist\r\nattacks in the strongest terms, stating\r\n“Our global village cannot tolerate such acts that\r\ndisrespect the value of human life and jeopardize\r\nworld peace and stability.”\r\nThe subsequent military action in Afghanistan\r\nwas understood, in principle, by the Seychelles\r\nGovernment as being in accordance with Article 51 of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Our Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, in an interview with the local media,\r\nreferred to this military action as “self-defence”, and\r\nexpressed the wish that only the terrorist networks and\r\ntheir clearly identified allies would be targeted, as part\r\nof a carefully proportioned action plan, sparing civilian\r\npopulations and avoiding any kind of linkage between\r\nreligious faiths and ideologically based deviation.\r\nThe Seychelles Government agrees with the\r\nfollowing principles. Terrorism is a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. There is no political or\r\nreligious justification for such violence. We vigorously\r\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nFurther to the events of 11 September, Seychelles\r\nrecognizes the right of the United States Government\r\nto react under guiding principles of international law\r\nand to bring the perpetrators to justice. But there is also\r\na need to acknowledge the root causes of terrorism,\r\nincluding extreme poverty, despair and injustice, and to\r\nstrongly advocate concerted efforts and collective\r\ncommitment throughout the world to eradicate poverty\r\nand underdevelopment. Based on those principles and\r\nconcerns, the position of my Government does not\r\ndiverge from the views and recommendations\r\nexpressed by the international community.\r\nWe appreciate the authority of the United Nations\r\nin providing global legitimacy for a universal response\r\nagainst terrorism. The war on terrorism must be fought\r\non many fronts. The elaboration of a broad, long-term\r\nstrategy for combating international terrorism,\r\nincluding military, political, diplomatic, legal and\r\neconomic means, is of paramount importance.\r\nSeychelles welcomes Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001, which outlines\r\nclear steps and measures that all United Nations\r\nMember States must now implement in order to\r\nprevent and suppress terrorist activities. My country is\r\nfully committed to implementing the provisions of the\r\nresolution, despite being handicapped by the\r\nconstraints linked to lack of capacities and resources.\r\nSeychelles is a party to six of the 12 existing\r\nUnited Nations conventions and protocols on terrorism.\r\nMy Government is taking steps to accede to the\r\nremaining six. Furthermore, we have also decided to\r\naccede to the 1999 Organization of African Unity\r\nAlgiers Convention on the Prevention and Combating\r\nof Terrorism.\r\nSeychelles fully supports the ongoing\r\nnegotiations to elaborate a comprehensive convention\r\non international terrorism. We commend the personal\r\nintervention of Secretary-General Annan in trying to\r\nbridge differences and achieve consensus. It is our\r\nhope that, despite the complex and sensitive nature of\r\nthe issues being addressed, the international\r\ncommunity will arrive at an agreement very soon.\r\nBearing in mind the unprecedented international\r\nmobilization against terrorism and the magnitude of the\r\n33\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\npresent situation, we consider that the larger,\r\ninfluential Members of the United Nations, particularly\r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council, should\r\nmanifest their strong political will and backing in\r\nresolving regional conflicts in all parts of the globe.\r\nAbove all, they must intensify their efforts to achieve a\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East. Let us not\r\nunderestimate the fact that regional conflicts are often\r\nbreeding grounds for terrorism.\r\nIt was mentioned earlier that terrorism is rooted\r\nin poverty. The United Nations must engage its full\r\npotential to vigorously pursue its development agenda.\r\nThis should comprise, inter alia, the drive for the\r\nalleviation of poverty and achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the quest for equitable distribution of the\r\nbenefits of globalization, and the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Summit goals, as well as the success of\r\nnext year’s International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nAs a small island State whose economy depends\r\nmainly on tourism and related industries, Seychelles’\r\nvulnerability is obviously at issue should the ongoing\r\nmilitary campaign in Afghanistan persist. As a peaceful\r\ncommunity enjoying stability and social harmony,\r\nSeychelles, without questioning its strong moral\r\nsupport for the cause of international security, also\r\nencourages a dialogue giving the voices of reason and\r\ncompassion a chance to be heard, especially with\r\nregard to the needs of the Afghan people, who have\r\nlived three decades of war, resulting in the suffering of\r\nvery large numbers of refugees and displaced persons.\r\nFinally, my country would like to lay stress on the\r\nurgency for the United Nations to rethink the world\r\norder, not just in terms of geopolitical balance, but in\r\nterms of a new ethic. International terrorism cannot be\r\nfought by way of offensive weapons, either traditional\r\nor sophisticated. To agree on a common value system\r\nis, in the middle and long terms, a more profitable\r\norientation for the whole of humanity.\r\nThis being said, my country renews its adhesion\r\nto the international coalition of nations that are united\r\nin the war on international terrorism and in the quest\r\nfor worldwide peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Sonatane Tua Taumoepeau Tupou,\r\nChairman of the delegation of Tonga.\r\nMr. Tupou (Tonga): In congratulating Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo upon his assumption of high office, I must\r\nalso praise his predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of\r\nFinland, for an outstanding tenure as the President who\r\nushered in the new millennium. If the Millennium\r\nSummit and its Declaration could be considered the\r\nhallmark of Mr. Holkeri’s presidency, then Mr. Han’s\r\nalready has one of equally impressive terms with the\r\nOrganization and its Secretary-General being awarded\r\nthe Nobel Peace Prize. Therefore, the re-election of\r\nMr. Kofi Annan for a second term as Secretary-General\r\nis sure testament not only to his own personal\r\ndedication, creative leadership and unwavering sense\r\nof spirit, but also to the vision and faith of the\r\nOrganization’s Member States.\r\nI take this occasion to offer Tonga’s solace to all\r\naffected delegations, and in particular the delegations\r\nof the Dominican Republic and the United States, for\r\nwhom the tragedy that befell their communities on 12\r\nNovember has such a profound bearing.\r\nLike other Member States, Tonga takes this\r\noccasion to express our sympathy and condolences to\r\nthe President and people of the United States for the\r\nsuffering and loss of life incurred during the attacks of\r\n11 September. In doing so, Tonga condemns in the\r\nstrongest possible terms these acts of terror, which\r\nremain without moral or lawful justification.\r\nThe events of 11 September have focused our\r\nOrganization’s attention on terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations and, more importantly, on the need\r\nto address this issue comprehensively. As such, Tonga\r\ncommends the timely and decisive action taken by the\r\nSecurity Council with respect to the events of 11\r\nSeptember. In doing so, we fully support the work of\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee and its mandated\r\nefforts to combat terrorism.\r\nIt has been stated that terrorism offends the core\r\nvalues of our Organization, and that is true. The irony\r\nis that, inasmuch as the events of 11 September were\r\nan affront to one’s sense of humanity, it is this very\r\nhumanity that has risen to prevail over extreme\r\nadversity. If last year’s catchphrase during the\r\nMillennium Summit was “We, the peoples”, that call is\r\nall the more pertinent this year in our collective efforts\r\nto combat terrorism.\r\nAs part of its contribution to these efforts, Tonga\r\nis taking steps to carefully study and consider the\r\nUnited Nations conventions on terrorism that it is not\r\n34\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nparty to. However, merely becoming parties to\r\nconventions will not be sufficient. Concrete steps will\r\nbe needed if small countries like ours are to fully and\r\nmeaningfully take part in these efforts.\r\nFor example, Tonga’s efforts to develop,\r\nimplement and maintain counter-terrorism measures\r\nwill require sustained financial and expert technical\r\nassistance on a solid foundation of a network of\r\ninformation exchange between relevant law\r\nenforcement and aviation agencies. In this regard, our\r\nefforts in combating terrorism will be but a microcosm\r\nfor addressing a wider plethora of development issues.\r\nAs much as the Millennium Declaration\r\nconcerned new commitments, or renewed commitments\r\nin some instances, Tonga commends the report of the\r\nSecretary-General for its innovation and detailed\r\ndescription as to how implementation of the\r\nDeclaration might be taken forward.\r\nWe look towards the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development as a further opportunity to\r\npursue a wide range of crucial thematic issues which\r\nare particularly critical to the development aspirations\r\nof developing countries. The balance required for\r\nforging consensus on these thematic issues is as\r\nimportant as the balance between official development\r\nassistance and the mobilization of limited domestic\r\nresources.\r\nWhile the Declaration of the recently concluded\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\r\nConference in Doha might give rise to optimism, Tonga\r\nseeks a simplified, streamlined and expeditious\r\naccession process for small island developing States\r\nlike ours who wish to join the WTO. In this regard, we\r\ncongratulate the People’s Republic of China upon its\r\nentry into the organization. A more flexible approach\r\nand time frame within which to meet obligations are\r\nneeded to enable countries like Tonga to adopt\r\nmeasures so as to fully participate in the WTO system\r\nand to fulfil the obligations of the WTO agreements\r\nwhile minimizing any adverse impacts upon our\r\npopulace. Such an accession process can be achieved\r\nonly with continuing technical and financial assistance.\r\nWe further look towards the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development as a complementary step in\r\nthe development path towards the reinvigoration of\r\ntargeted commitments to sustainable development —\r\nespecially those concerning small island developing\r\nStates — as contained in Agenda 21. We continue to\r\ncall on the international community for refocused\r\ncommitment to and implementation of the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action. Tonga’s preparations for this\r\nSummit, through its national assessment report, will\r\ninclude identifying areas for specific and priority\r\ncapacity-building needs as well as avenues by which to\r\ntake greater advantage of financial and technological\r\nsupport.\r\nWhile Tonga recognizes the merit of the\r\neconomic vulnerability index as a measure for\r\neconomic impacts, its application should encompass all\r\nsmall island developing States and not serve as a means\r\nto draw superficial differences between them. After all,\r\nthe economic vulnerability index is an accurate\r\nreflection of the true realities of small island\r\ndeveloping States, and if those realities are not fully\r\naddressed, we shall continue to perch precariously on\r\nthe edge of the precipice. Therefore, we continue to\r\nsupport the development of an appropriate\r\nenvironmental vulnerability index, and we commend\r\nthe work of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience\r\nCommission in this regard. We believe that such an\r\nindex will provide accurate indicators of factors to\r\nwhich small islands are vulnerable, such as natural\r\ndisasters, sea-level rise and climate change. Tonga\r\ntherefore welcomes the consensus reached at\r\nMarrakech at the seventh session of the Conference of\r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change and the further\r\nopportunities for progress that it presents.\r\nAs a developing ocean State, we continue to seek\r\nour fair share of the harvest from the ocean which\r\nbounds us on all sides. We welcome in particular the\r\npreparations for making effective the Convention on\r\nthe Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory\r\nFish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.\r\nWe urge the distant water fishing nations in our region\r\nwith a real interest in fisheries to make every effort to\r\nbecome party to a convention that is the hallmark of\r\nour commitment to the conservation and sustainable\r\nmanagement of a critically important resource. Tonga\r\ncontinues to value the work and decisions this year at\r\nthe eleventh Meeting of States Parties to the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the\r\nInternational Seabed Authority and the United Nations\r\nOpen-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans\r\nand the Law of the Sea — UNICPOLOS.\r\nWe continue to view information and\r\ncommunication technologies as the way to go, and we\r\n35\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nare making our own efforts to bridge the digital divide\r\nto take full advantage of the digital revolution.\r\nMaximizing such efforts will require complementary\r\nefforts in tandem with the international community and\r\nthe United Nations. We urge continued support for the\r\nSmall Islands Developing States Network, SIDSnet,\r\nand efforts to strengthen its capacity to support and\r\nassist small island developing States.\r\nTonga welcomes the adoption of the Declaration\r\nof Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the establishment of\r\nthe global fund to combat this scourge. We look\r\nforward to the implementation of the Declaration and\r\ncommend those Member States who have pledged their\r\nfinancial support to the fund.\r\nWe continue to support the effort to reform the\r\nSecurity Council. In this regard, as was presented by a\r\ndelegation during the debate on Security Council\r\nreform, we could support either proposal for an\r\nexpansion of the number of permanent seats: by two,\r\nwith an expansion of the number of non-permanent\r\nseats by three, or, alternatively, by three, with the\r\nnumber of non-permanent seats increased by four.\r\nWhile cognizant that issues pertaining to the veto and\r\nits exercise in such an expansion would continue to\r\ndemand handling with the utmost sensitivity and care,\r\nwe urge that where there are issues of convergence,\r\nsteps should be taken to consolidate such convergence,\r\nand where unresolved issues remain, that these be the\r\nfocus of continuing dialogue and discussion.\r\nFinally, with respect to pertinent regional issues\r\nin the Pacific, Tonga endorses the views expressed in\r\nthe Nauru communiqué, now contained in document\r\nA/56/388, which was the outcome of the annual\r\nmeeting of Pacific Island Forum leaders at Nauru in\r\nAugust this year.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Mr. Clifford\r\nSibusiso Mamba, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nSwaziland.\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland): It is an honour and\r\nprivilege for me to deliver this statement on behalf of\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III. I wish to convey the\r\ngreetings and warm wishes of His Majesty, Her\r\nMajesty The Queen Mother, Ndlovukazi, the\r\nGovernment and the entire Swazi nation to all our\r\nfriends and fellow Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland offers her warmest\r\ncongratulations to the President on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. We are confident that with his proven abilities\r\nand leadership, he will guide us to success in our\r\ndeliberations at this time of crisis in global affairs.\r\nAllow me to express our appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Harri Holkeri, of\r\nFinland, who, by his astute and judicious leadership,\r\nbrought to a successful conclusion the work of the\r\nfifty-fifth session.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would further like to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nleading our Organization so effectively through his\r\ntenure thus far. We will continue to depend on his\r\nhighly developed sense of diplomacy and his\r\nundoubted commitment to achieve global peace,\r\nstability and equitable development. The recent award\r\nof the Nobel Peace Prize to both the Secretary-General\r\nand the United Nations attests to the aforementioned\r\nattributes.\r\nWe are also grateful for the continuing dedication\r\nand hard work of the staff of the United Nations, whose\r\nefforts are needed all the more in these challenging\r\ntimes. In this regard, we call upon all our fellow\r\nMembers to demonstrate their support for the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff by honouring their\r\nfinancial obligations, so that our Organization can have\r\nsufficient resources with which to meet the widening\r\nscope of its activities.\r\nWe are meeting one year after the historic\r\ngathering of world leaders, when the international\r\ncommunity sought to redefine and articulate a common\r\nvision for the future of all its citizens. The goals to be\r\nachieved were clearly set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration as an outcome of the Millennium Summit.\r\nToday we have the opportunity — indeed, the\r\nresponsibility — to evaluate just how far we have come\r\nin that mission which we set for ourselves through this\r\nOrganization. We need to address honestly our\r\nshortcomings in commitment and action and to further\r\ndevise practical and realistic strategies that will result\r\nin measurable progress in areas identified for urgent\r\naction.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland therefore believes\r\nthat the promotion of sustainable international peace\r\nand security must be one of the main priorities of the\r\nUnited Nations, because it is clear that our collective\r\naim of raising the living standard of our peoples is\r\n36\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\npossible only in conditions of global stability and with\r\nnations living harmoniously alongside one another.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joined the rest of the\r\nworld in condemnation of the tragic terrorist attacks of\r\n11 September, to which the international community\r\nmust respond because such acts are an assault on\r\nhuman decency and humanity. These acts cannot be\r\njustified under any circumstances. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland repudiates such acts and aligns itself with all\r\npeace-loving people around the world not only in\r\ncondemning such acts, but also in calling for their\r\ncomplete eradication. To that end, the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland will do all in its power to prevent acts of\r\nterrorism and to ensure that the support and financing\r\nof terrorism cannot take root on Swazi soil. We once\r\nmore offer our sympathy and prayers to the families\r\nand friends of those who lost their lives in the tragedy.\r\nFuture global stability is threatened by the spread\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, as well as the\r\nunabated proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons. Vigorous and urgent efforts are needed to\r\neliminate these weapons. In this regard, we welcome\r\nthe successful conclusion of the United Nations\r\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, as well as of\r\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. We\r\ndeem their outcomes timely and necessary.\r\nWhile much has been done through the process of\r\nreform effected by the Secretary-General, it is also\r\nrecognized that there has been very little progress made\r\nso far by the Open-ended Working Group to address\r\nthe most important aspect of the reform: the\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council. More intensified\r\nefforts should be made to bring to a conclusion the\r\ndeliberations on this issue, and we look forward to the\r\nleadership of the President of the General Assembly in\r\nadvancing negotiations towards a lasting solution. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland is still committed to the process\r\nof the reform for the expansion of the Security Council\r\nin both categories of its membership. In that regard, we\r\ncontinue to support the African position in favour of\r\ntwo permanent seats and three non-permanent seats\r\nbeing allocated to the African continent.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\r\nUnited Nations, in conjunction with regional\r\norganizations, must take on a more proactive role in\r\npreventive diplomacy to head off potentially explosive\r\nsituations. We need an effective early warning\r\ncapability to deal with emerging conflicts and much\r\ncloser collaboration between the Security Council and\r\nthe Office of the Secretary-General in our efforts to\r\nmeet security challenges wherever they may occur.\r\nAt this time, our Organization is understandably\r\nfocused on global security. The crisis in the peace\r\nprocess between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is\r\na component of the overall challenge and continues to\r\npose a significant threat to security in both the Middle\r\nEast and the wider world at large. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland believes that the only solution to the\r\ncontinuing instability in that region is through peaceful\r\ndialogue and a return to the spirit of compromise and\r\nunderstanding that has characterized the relationship\r\nbetween the two sides in the past. We commend the\r\nefforts of all who are trying to bring lasting,\r\nsustainable peace to the Middle East, and we offer our\r\nencouragement and support for the achievement of this\r\ngoal.\r\nOn the African continent, security challenges\r\ncontinue to cause suffering and restrict the\r\ndevelopment of many millions of our people. While\r\nthis is undeniable, it is also clear that Africa itself is\r\ntaking on the responsibility to find solutions to the\r\ncrises affecting a number of its nations. The peace\r\nprocesses in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea and Angola\r\nall have benefited from the involvement of our regional\r\nand subregional groupings and from the efforts of\r\ndedicated African men and women. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland supports unequivocally these efforts, and we\r\njoin our fellow African Member States in calling for\r\ncontinued and enhanced support from the United\r\nNations and individual countries and for commitments\r\nin word to be followed up by action.\r\nIn developmental terms, there is a new wind\r\nblowing through all the African countries, bringing\r\nfresh hope to our peoples for improved standards of\r\nliving and the removal of the burdens of the past. A\r\nseries of historic agreements by all African countries\r\nindicates a new era of optimism for the continent, as\r\nwell as the start of a new relationship with the rest of\r\nthe world. The continent will no longer tolerate the\r\nnotion of unconstitutional Governments, and we have\r\nall confirmed our belief that transparency and\r\naccountability are the watchwords of governance that\r\nplaces people at the centre of development.\r\n37\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nWe also believe that trade with the rest of the\r\nworld is the lifeblood of our developing economies,\r\nencouraging the creation of businesses and inward and\r\nlocal investment and increasing employment. We\r\ntherefore commend those countries and trading blocs\r\nthat recognize the importance to Africa of freeing up\r\ntheir markets for our goods and services and encourage\r\nothers to follow suit.\r\nThe birth of the African Union is a signal to the\r\nrest of the world that Africa means business and is\r\nready to back up its words with action. The New\r\nAfrican Initiative proposes a partnership that is based\r\non support for an Africa that recognizes and accepts its\r\nresponsibilities from a world that understands our\r\npriorities for development. We commend the initiative\r\nto those who are in a position to help Africa emerge\r\nfrom the disappointments of the past into a prosperous\r\nand secure future.\r\nWe are on the edge of a global recession, and its\r\neffects will be felt hardest among those of us in the\r\ndeveloping world. After a decade of encouraging talk\r\nof the benefits of globalization, we are discovering the\r\nhard truth: that we are nowhere near the stage of being\r\nable to gain advantage from a world of liberalized\r\ntrade. This must now surely be plain for anyone to see.\r\nGlobalization in its unfettered form is likely to do\r\nmore harm than good to the small, vulnerable\r\neconomies unless measures are put in place to protect\r\nthem in the short to medium term. There must be\r\nagreed ground rules to regulate the conduct of free\r\ntrade in goods and services to ensure an equitable\r\nexchange between unequal partners.\r\nConsidering the intrinsic link between peace,\r\nsecurity and development, the United Nations has an\r\neven bigger responsibility to increase its efforts to\r\nsecure resources to finance development, especially for\r\nthose of us most at risk in these times of economic\r\nuncertainty. We believe it is the responsibility of the\r\nwider international community to continue to provide\r\nresources to assist developing countries to fight their\r\nway out of poverty.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to develop\r\nconfidently and peacefully, according to the wishes of\r\nits people. Our review of the Constitution was\r\ncompleted earlier this year, and the recommendations\r\nof the people will now be drafted into a legal document\r\nfor final approval by the Swazi nation next year. This\r\nvital nation-building process will result in a\r\nConstitution that is based entirely on the wishes of the\r\npeople themselves, and we are confident that it will\r\nserve the best interests of the Kingdom for many\r\ngenerations to come.\r\nPoverty alleviation remains the top priority for\r\nthe Kingdom, and we continue to make great efforts to\r\nachieve this aim through a series of economic\r\nmeasures, such as investment attraction, increased\r\ntrade and the stimulation of local entrepreneurship. We\r\nare embarking on an ambitious programme to\r\nmaximize the potential of our tourism and industry\r\nsectors, and in this we need the support of the\r\ninternational financial institutions, as well as the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\r\nDespite our best efforts, and in common with all\r\ndeveloping countries, the Kingdom is finding progress\r\ndifficult to achieve in the face of huge obstacles, with\r\nthe greatest undoubtedly being the threat to our future\r\nposed by the HIV/AIDS crisis. During the United\r\nNations special session on HIV/AIDS held here in\r\nJune, we made clear the scale of the disaster facing our\r\nnation. There is no doubt that the spread of HIV among\r\nthe population represents our greatest development\r\nchallenge, and we are working hard in a combined,\r\nnational effort to overcome the devastating effects of\r\nthe pandemic.\r\nHowever, we cannot do this alone. We need\r\nsubstantial support to implement our strategy of\r\neducation, prevention, care and counselling. Finances,\r\ndrugs, expertise and guidance are all urgently required.\r\nThe very survival of our nation is at stake, and we\r\nappeal once more to the United Nations and to the\r\ninternational community at large not to abandon us at\r\nthis moment of supreme necessity.\r\nIt could be said that there has been an\r\ninauspicious start to the twenty-first century, with the\r\nglobalization of terrorism and the reality of a global\r\neconomic recession at the forefront of our minds. This\r\nplaces all the more responsibility on the United Nations\r\nto harness the resources and commitment of the\r\ncitizens of the world for the benefit of humankind. In\r\nthis regard, there is a compelling need to include all\r\npeoples of the world, as envisaged by our founding\r\nfathers and as enshrined in the principle of universality.\r\nAcknowledging the importance of this principle,\r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland raises once more the\r\nquestion of the inclusion of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan in the activities of the United Nations and its\r\n38\r\nA/56/PV.56\r\nassociated agencies. We appeal on behalf of the 23\r\nmillion people of the Republic of China on Taiwan for\r\ntheir right to representation in the United Nations\r\nOrganization. The Government and people of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan have shown themselves\r\nto be wholly committed to observing the principles and\r\nspirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nand of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn addition to the peaceful democratic transition\r\nthat took place last year, the recent admission of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade\r\nOrganization attests to the significant contribution the\r\nRepublic of China has made and will continue to make\r\nto international trade. The Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan has shown time and again its willingness to\r\nparticipate in efforts to bring about true global peace,\r\ndevelopment and security, and its commitment to\r\nutilize its resources for the benefit of mankind.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland has been at the\r\nforefront of efforts to support the readmittance of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the United Nations.\r\nOur position on this important issue remains\r\nunchanged. We therefore appeal to our fellow Members\r\nto support the establishment of a working group to\r\nexamine in detail the exceptional international situation\r\nrelating to the Republic of China on Taiwan, with a\r\nview to ensuring that its 23 million people can\r\ncontribute actively to the international community\r\nthrough participation in the United Nations and its\r\nrelated agencies.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, we the Member\r\nStates of the United Nations agreed to seize the\r\nopportunity to forge a new era of optimism for the\r\nworld, based on equality, peace and prosperity. That\r\nopportunity is fading fast, and we need to redouble our\r\nefforts and determination to make that vision a reality.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland renews its commitment to\r\nthe Charter and aims of the United Nations and offers\r\nto its fellow Members assurances of continued support\r\nfor all activities that will help the world to achieve a\r\nbetter future for all its peoples.\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: On Wednesday, 21 November\r\n2001, in the morning, the General Assembly will take\r\nup sub-item (d) of agenda item 16, “Elections to fill\r\nvacancies in subsidiary organs and other elections:\r\nElection of the Executive Director of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme” as the second item\r\nfor that morning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
