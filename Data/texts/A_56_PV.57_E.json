(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Gints Jegermanis, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nLatvia.\r\nMr. Jegermanis (Latvia): It is my honour to\r\naddress the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.\r\nSince the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism has become a clear priority on the\r\ninternational agenda. The United Nations is playing a\r\nkey role in coordinating joint measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism. My country reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to be vigorous in handling this matter.\r\nWe must act on all levels — global, regional and\r\nnational — if we are to succeed in combating\r\nterrorism. Today, the need for international cooperation\r\nhas assumed new dimensions. To achieve sustainable\r\nresults in eliminating terrorism, joint international\r\naction is mandatory.\r\nLatvia strongly welcomes and supports Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).\r\nLatvia is convinced that full and unconditional\r\nimplementation of Council resolution 1373 (2001) is\r\nimperative for success in the suppression of terrorism.\r\nThe financing of terrorism has to be prevented and\r\neliminated. All action or inaction by States or\r\nindividuals that allows the practice of terrorism has to\r\nbe stopped. Cooperation and information exchange\r\namong States concerning terrorist activities has to be\r\nstrengthened. Latvia welcomes the establishment of the\r\nSecurity Council Committee to monitor the\r\nimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nLatvia supports efforts undertaken by other\r\ninternational organizations acting on the regional level.\r\nAs an aspiring member of the Euro-Atlantic\r\ncommunity, Latvia plays its part in the common\r\nactivities carried out by the European Union and the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. In order to\r\nharmonize regional measures to prevent acts of\r\nterrorism, an action plan for Central and Eastern\r\nEuropean countries was adopted at the recent Warsaw\r\nconference on combating terrorism. Another important\r\nEuropean framework for combating terrorism is the\r\nCouncil of Europe, which has already formulated a\r\nwide range of legal instruments intended to fight\r\nterrorism.\r\nMy country fully shares the position of the\r\nEuropean Union that we must redouble our efforts to\r\nfight international terrorism. That includes both our\r\ncommitment as members of the international\r\ncommunity and the “homework” we have to do as\r\nindividual States.\r\nA high-level task force has been established in\r\nLatvia to coordinate national efforts against terrorism,\r\nincluding implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001). Latvia has\r\ninitiated the national legislative process of ratifying the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, and it is foreseen that we will\r\nsign the Convention by the end of this year.\r\nThe Latvian Government has approved an action\r\nplan for combating terrorism. This is a set of measures\r\naimed at strengthening my country’s ability to prevent\r\nits territory, banking system and other assets from\r\nbeing used by terrorists. There should be no place\r\nwhere terrorists can hide from justice. Latvia has\r\nalready formulated legislation in the area of preventing\r\nmoney laundering. Banks and other operators are\r\nobliged to report on suspicious transfers. The\r\nGovernment has submitted to the parliament a package\r\nof further amendments to the banking law and the law\r\non the prevention of the laundering of proceeds derived\r\nfrom criminal activity.\r\nAs it defends the world from terrorism, the\r\ninternational community has to do its utmost to spare\r\nthe innocent people of Afghanistan further suffering.\r\nLatvia fully supports the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and other\r\nparties in their efforts to bring about a fully inclusive\r\npolitical system in Afghanistan. My country welcomes\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1378 (2001). The Latvian\r\nGovernment has also taken the decision to provide\r\nhumanitarian aid to the Afghan people through the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees.\r\nWe believe that the priorities that existed before\r\n11 September are all the more valid today. A year ago,\r\nheads of State or Government adopted the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which renewed the spirit of the United\r\nNations and which clearly demonstrated that the world\r\nand its peoples need this Organization. Latvia attaches\r\ngreat importance to the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, especially in relation to issues\r\nof human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rights of\r\nthe child and conflict prevention. We consider that the\r\nfollow-up process to the Millennium Summit should be\r\nan integral part of the work of the United Nations.\r\nInternational relations in the twenty-first century have\r\nto be based on values and principles set out in the\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly\r\ndemonstrated that the commitment that was put into the\r\nMillennium Declaration was genuine. The results of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s special sessions on human\r\nsettlements and on HIV/AIDS, the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects and the Durban\r\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance\r\nhave set a number of goals at the State, regional and\r\nglobal levels. The process has started, and Latvia is\r\nactively participating in pursuit of the common goals.\r\nThe United Nations is the only global\r\nOrganization charged with the fundamental task of\r\nsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war\r\nand with the maintenance of lasting peace and\r\ninternational security. One of its most important tasks,\r\ntherefore, involves peacekeeping operations.\r\nMy country has actively participated in United\r\nNations-mandated peacekeeping operations since 1996.\r\nThis year Latvia is continuing to provide support to\r\nstabilize the situation in the Balkans and is\r\nparticipating, with troops and personnel, in all United\r\nNations-mandated, NATO-led operations in the\r\nBalkans, as well as in other operations and endeavours\r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE).\r\nLatvia, which attaches great importance to\r\npeacekeeping operations, voluntarily increased its\r\ncontribution to the United Nations peacekeeping\r\nbudget starting in 2001.\r\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt has been one of the priorities of the United\r\nNations for a decade. My country signed the Rome\r\nStatute in 1999, and the Government will present to\r\nParliament the ratification bill of the Statute and drafts\r\nof the necessary amendments to our national legislation\r\nas soon as possible. Latvia also hopes to be among the\r\nfirst 60 States to ratify the Statute.\r\nThis is an important session of the General\r\nAssembly for Latvia and for its people. This year\r\nmarks a decade since Latvia joined the United Nations\r\nas a free and independent country. The United Nations\r\nwas the first international organization that Latvia\r\njoined, after 50 years of occupation. The United\r\nNations has a special meaning for Latvia. Latvia’s\r\njoining the United Nations demonstrates the\r\ncommitment of my country to rejoin the international\r\ncommunity and to take an active part in international\r\nevents and processes.\r\nIn these 10 years, Latvia has made great headway\r\nin its development, and this growth encompasses a\r\nvariety of realms. Latvia’s foreign policy is rooted in\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nthe observance of international law, the development of\r\nhuman rights and democracy and the protection of\r\nuniversally accepted human values. The top priorities\r\nof Latvian foreign policy continue to be joining the\r\nEuropean Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization. These are not goals in themselves, but,\r\nrather, means to ensure sustainable development. Our\r\nforeign policy priorities also include good-neighbourly\r\nrelations, bilateral cooperation and active participation\r\nin international organizations.\r\nI have the honour to announce that Latvia is\r\nchanging its status from that of aid recipient to that of\r\ndonor country, in order to provide its support to others\r\nthrough both financial assistance and the sharing of\r\nexperiences. Latvia has begun to elaborate its concept\r\nof a donor country. We are looking forward to the\r\nimplementation of this concept and are assisting those\r\nwho are in urgent need of our help.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to congratulate the\r\nUnited Nations and its Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\r\non having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in\r\nrecognition of the work that has been carried out. I am\r\nconvinced that we, as Member States, will continue to\r\nspare no effort in safeguarding the principles and ideals\r\nfor which the United Nations stands.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. John Dauth, Chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Australia.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): Sir, let me begin, like\r\nothers, by congratulating you on having been elected\r\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Let me also very warmly commend you on\r\nyour commitment to making the most efficient use of\r\nthe Assembly’s time, including — if I may say — by\r\nbeginning meetings punctually. I also want to join other\r\nspeakers in congratulating the Secretary-General, Kofi\r\nAnnan, and the United Nations more generally on their\r\nheartily deserved receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September in\r\nWashington, D.C., and here in New York City were not\r\njust attacks on the United States. Australia, along with\r\nmore than 80 other nations, lost innocent civilians. We\r\nare united in our grief for the victims and their\r\nfamilies. Australia condemns these attacks and\r\nreaffirms unequivocally that terrorism is never justified\r\nand must never be tolerated.\r\nAustralia has joined the international coalition\r\nagainst terrorism. We have invoked our mutual security\r\npact for the first time with the United States, and we\r\nare contributing military forces to the campaign against\r\nthose responsible for the 11 September attacks.\r\nThe international community is obliged to close\r\nranks against terrorism. We must starve terrorists of\r\ntheir support — financial, political and moral. We must\r\ndeny terrorists safe haven. We must bring terrorists to\r\naccount.\r\nAustralia commends Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) of 28 September, which targets\r\ncomprehensively the terrorist menace. We will work\r\nclosely with the Committee on Counter-Terrorism of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nAustralia has introduced new measures to prevent\r\nand suppress the financing of terrorism and is already\r\nparty to all but one of the 12 international counter-\r\nterrorism instruments.\r\nA comprehensive convention against terrorism is\r\npotentially a very important symbol of global\r\ncommitment on this issue. As the Assembly is aware,\r\nAustralia has taken a leading role in the negotiations,\r\nreflecting our strong commitment to strengthening the\r\ninternational legal framework. While we are\r\nencouraged by the progress this past month, we join the\r\nSecretary-General in urging the parties to conclude the\r\nconvention without delay.\r\nThe events of 11 September underline how\r\nimportant it is that we maintain and strengthen\r\ninternational non-proliferation regimes governing\r\nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons. If we want\r\nto prevent the spread of ballistic missiles and\r\nassociated technology — and if we want to strengthen\r\nmechanisms relating to conventional weapons — then\r\nwe also need a stronger commitment to other arms\r\ncontrol and disarmament instruments as well.\r\nLet me turn now to East Timor. We all have a\r\ndeep interest in a stable, secure, viable and democratic\r\nEast Timor. East Timor is no longer an emergency, but,\r\ninstead, an emerging nation.\r\nHowever, much more needs to be done. East\r\nTimor remains vulnerable, and the role of the United\r\nNations is not complete. We need, after independence,\r\nan integrated United Nations mission of civilians,\r\npolice and peacekeepers, under a single Security\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nCouncil mandate funded from United Nations assessed\r\ncontributions.\r\nAustralia therefore welcomes the Security\r\nCouncil President’s statement of 31 October endorsing\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendations for a United\r\nNations successor mission in East Timor. We look\r\nforward to working with others over the coming\r\nmonths to set a solid and sensible mandate for a\r\nsuccessor mission.\r\nCooperative relations between East Timor and\r\nIndonesia are key to East Timor’s longer-term security\r\nand to that of the region as a whole. We very much\r\nwelcome steps by both sides to resolve outstanding\r\nissues.\r\nWe welcome progress by the Indonesian\r\nGovernment to resolve the situation in refugee camps\r\nin West Timor, and we urge continued efforts to ensure\r\nsecurity and to facilitate the safe return of refugees.\r\nJustice and reconciliation are important to East\r\nTimor’s longer-term stability and prosperity. Australia\r\nwelcomes steps by President Megawati Soekarnoputri\r\nto expand the jurisdiction of the ad hoc human rights\r\ncourt and her Government’s commitment to bring to\r\njustice those who have perpetrated human rights crimes\r\nin East Timor. That commitment was reconfirmed in a\r\nmost welcome way in the Assembly yesterday by the\r\nForeign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Hassan Wirajuda.\r\nAustralia will continue to support East Timor\r\ngenerously. We have an agreement to share resources\r\nfrom the Timor Sea. We are helping to reduce poverty\r\nin East Timor and we are building East Timorese\r\ncapacity to govern peacefully and democratically. We\r\nurge others to support East Timor. This is our chance,\r\ncollectively in the international community, to ensure\r\nthat the United Nations historic mission in East Timor\r\nis remembered as a success.\r\nLet me talk about what we in Australia call\r\n“people-smuggling”. Australia has a proud history as a\r\nmajor country of migration. We are, as a result of over\r\na century of planned and managed legal migration, a\r\ntolerant multicultural society. We will continue as a\r\ncountry of migration and we will continue to take more\r\nthan our fair share of refugees.\r\nRegrettably, Australia is also increasingly a\r\nfavoured target for illegal migration, assisted by\r\nindividuals and criminal syndicates engaged in the\r\npernicious crime of people-smuggling. Many other\r\ncountries — as either transit or destination countries —\r\nare also affected by this problem. As with other\r\ntransnational crimes, combating the phenomenon of\r\npeople-smuggling requires not just national, but also\r\nconcerted regional and multilateral action.\r\nPeople-smugglers are primarily organized crime\r\nsyndicates. They exploit their victims. They find their\r\nclients among people who have experienced conflict or\r\npersecution, economic downturn or extreme\r\nenvironmental breakdown. They target those desperate\r\nfor a better life. The loss recently of more than 350\r\nlives, when a people-smuggling boat headed for\r\nAustralia sank, is a tragic reminder of the human costs\r\ninvolved and of the callousness of people-smugglers.\r\nIrregular migration, facilitated by people-\r\nsmuggling, undermines the integrity of the\r\ninternational protection system. All countries share an\r\ninterest in protecting and strengthening the\r\ninternational protection system. To do so, we must\r\ntackle the problem of people-smuggling. A year ago, at\r\nthe Millennium Summit, leaders committed us to fight\r\npeople-smuggling and other transnational crimes. We\r\nshould redouble our efforts to do so. We need\r\ncoordinated, comprehensive approaches and concerted\r\ninternational action to address all its aspects. Root\r\ncauses in source countries need to be addressed. The\r\nhumanitarian and other needs of displaced persons in\r\ncountries of first asylum need to be addressed. Transit\r\ncountries and countries of destination need to\r\ncooperate more effectively.\r\nAustralia is working closely with its neighbours\r\nin the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen our capacity to\r\nprevent and deter people-smuggling and to bring\r\nperpetrators to justice. This will continue to be a high\r\npriority for my Government. We will also continue to\r\ncontribute to broader international efforts to deal with\r\nthe causes of irregular migration. These efforts, which\r\nhave the protection needs of refugees at their core, will\r\ncontinue while we work with others in our region and\r\ninternationally to combat illegal migration and people-\r\nsmuggling.\r\nAfghans fleeing the devastation of their homeland\r\npose a particular challenge to the international\r\ncommunity. A renewed focus and a more coordinated\r\nresponse are needed. Australia supports the efforts of\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees and those of the countries of first asylum\r\nto protect refugees in South-West Asia. We have\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nadvocated, consistently and strongly, a comprehensive\r\nresponse to the Afghan situation and substantially\r\nincreased our assistance to displaced and vulnerable\r\nAfghans in South-West Asia.\r\nThe international community faces grave new\r\nchallenges that threaten global peace and prosperity. At\r\nthe same time, as the Secretary-General said in his\r\nstatement, the challenges that faced us before 11\r\nSeptember — poverty, disease, development — have\r\nnot diminished. The need for international cooperation\r\nhas never been greater. It is therefore tremendously\r\nimportant that agreement was reached in Doha to\r\nlaunch the development round of world trade\r\nliberalization. Free trade, including in agriculture,\r\noffers benefits for all countries and is crucial for\r\ndeveloping countries to overcome poverty.\r\nFinally, I want to say that Australia stands ready\r\nto support international efforts to combat international\r\nterrorism and the spread of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Australia stands ready to ensure that recent\r\nUnited Nations successes — such as in East Timor —\r\nhelp create vibrant and sustainable democracies in\r\nwhich people can be assured of their future and that of\r\ntheir children. Australia stands ready to contribute to\r\nsustained international action against people-smuggling\r\nat source, in transit and at destination. Australia urges\r\nthat this fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\r\nmakes substantial progress towards those same goals.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Said Abdella, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Abdella (Eritrea) (spoke in Arabic): Please\r\nallow me to extend to you, Sir, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Eritrea, warm congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-sixth session. I am confident that, under your\r\nwise and able leadership, our deliberations will come\r\nto a fruitful conclusion. The Eritrean delegation assures\r\nyou of its full cooperation and support.\r\nMay I also extend to your predecessor, Mr. Harri\r\nHolkeri of Finland, our deep appreciation for the\r\nskilful and wise manner in which he conducted the\r\ndeliberations of the fifty-fifth session.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to extend\r\nheartfelt congratulations, on behalf of the people and\r\nGovernment of the State of Eritrea, to Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nupon his well-deserved election for a second term. I am\r\ncertain that our Organization will benefit immensely\r\nduring his second term, as it did during his first, from\r\nhis vision, wisdom, competent leadership and selfless\r\ndedication. I also wish to congratulate him and the\r\nUnited Nations on their well-deserved awarding of the\r\n2001 Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nAllow me to express, on behalf of the people and\r\nGovernment of the State of Eritrea, profound sorrow\r\nand to extend sincere condolences to the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America in this\r\ntheir time of grief following the hateful attacks of 11\r\nSeptember. We also wish to extend our heartfelt\r\nsympathy and condolences for the victims of the\r\npainful aeroplane crash of 12 November.\r\nThe Government of Eritrea condemns the\r\nbarbaric act committed against innocent civilians by a\r\nfew craven terrorists. From the outset, we declared\r\nsolidarity with the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States against those heinous acts.\r\nTerrorism violates the most basic of human\r\nrights: the right to life. Therefore, we must all unite in\r\nthe protection of all our citizens against these\r\ndastardly, desperate acts perpetrated by individuals or\r\norganized terrorist networks. There should be no\r\nimpunity for such criminals.\r\nHumankind entered the new millennium with\r\noptimism and hope — and for good reason. It had\r\nrecognized, through bitter experience, the folly of war\r\nand conflict and the virtue of peace, good-\r\nneighbourliness and cooperative relations. It had had\r\nthe opportunity to review past achievements and errors\r\nand to identify sources of strength and weakness. It had\r\nevolved lofty norms, values and principles. It had\r\nestablished refined procedures and created effective\r\nmechanisms to guarantee their implementation.\r\nUnfortunately, however, humankind had not yet\r\nmustered the necessary determination or the collective\r\nwill to translate that vision into reality. It is evident\r\nthat it has not yet learned the ways of comprehensive\r\npeace. The full blooming of a culture of peace and\r\ndevelopment remains so near and yet so distant.\r\nConsequently, two years into the new millennium,\r\nwe continue to witness with dismay immense poverty\r\nand want in the midst of massive wealth in the world,\r\ndeprivation in spite of the enormous advances in\r\nscience and technology, wilful violations of human\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nrights and manifestations of mutual hatred and\r\nhostility.\r\nThe statistics are dismal. Yet, we must not be\r\nunduly alarmed, if only because it is too early to be\r\ndiscouraged by unfulfilled and unkept promises. On the\r\ncontrary, we must decide to confront the challenges,\r\nincluding the depressing disparity between the rich and\r\nthe poor, and issues of war and peace and violations of\r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe must collectively address the new forces that\r\nare being unleashed by science and technology,\r\nincluding globalization. Globalization can serve as an\r\neffective instrument for establishing an equitable and\r\njust relationship between the rich and the poor and for\r\npromoting sustainable development to the mutual\r\nbenefit of all. However, this can be achieved only if a\r\ncooperative mechanism is established immediately,\r\nduring this critically early stage of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, before we are overtaken by the speed of the\r\ntechnology and information revolution. It is equally\r\nimportant that the capacities of the poor nations be\r\nincreased without delay in order to ensure their\r\neffective participation in the global economy.\r\nIt must also be acknowledged that peace, security\r\nand stability are closely linked to development. It need\r\nnot be emphasized that there is no development without\r\npeace, and no peace without security. To this end, all\r\nefforts must also include development concerns.\r\nThe world continues to be plagued by wars and\r\nconflicts that have spilled over from the previous\r\ncentury, in spite of the international community’s\r\nefforts and full commitment to peace, security and\r\nstability.\r\nThe African continent has perhaps fared the worst\r\nin the last few years, as it has been beleaguered by\r\nrepeated economic catastrophes, political disruptions\r\nand inter-State and intra-State conflicts.\r\nIt is a source of deep concern to us that\r\nglobalization has had a severely negative impact on\r\nAfrican economies. It has deepened their\r\nmarginalization and kept them from benefiting from\r\nthe global economy. Africa suffers more than any other\r\nregion from extreme poverty and, indeed, from\r\nrecurrent famine. Plagues like malaria, tuberculosis,\r\nHIV/AIDS, diarrhoea and a host of other debilitating\r\nand fatal tropical diseases have, in many cases, reached\r\nbiblical proportions. The decimation of populations has\r\nhad horrendous consequences on many already weak\r\neconomies.\r\nIn addition to economic crises and poverty,\r\nconflicts, wars and civil strife have prominently\r\nafflicted Africa during the past decade and a half. In\r\n1999, close to 20 conflicts were wreaking havoc on the\r\ncontinent. It was in acknowledgement of the gravity of\r\nthe matter that the Organization of African Unity\r\nSummit, held in Algiers in 1999, decided to declare\r\n2000 as the year for ending conflicts and giving\r\nmomentum to peace.\r\nIt was an auspicious year. There were\r\nencouraging signs in the Sudan, Somalia and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and a\r\ncomprehensive peace agreement was signed between\r\nEritrea and Ethiopia. Yet much remains to be done. It is\r\nencouraging to note that Africans are making great and\r\nsustained efforts to resolve the conflicts in Sierra\r\nLeone, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, the Great Lakes region,\r\nSomalia and the Sudan at the regional level.\r\nIn the same vein, a just and durable solution to\r\nthe problem in the Middle East must be found through\r\nthe creation of a fully independent Palestinian State.\r\nThe international community must be involved\r\nmore meaningfully in assisting the peoples of these\r\ncountries. Yet, the primary responsibility for resolving\r\nconflict, achieving national reconciliation and\r\nestablishing peace, security and stability lies with the\r\npeoples and leaders of these countries. It must also be\r\nemphasized that, while any regional assistance\r\nrendered is to be appreciated, it must be predicated\r\nupon the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the\r\nassisted countries. Such assistance should be based on\r\nlofty principles and aimed at serving the interests and\r\nwell-being of the countries in question.\r\nThe Horn of Africa has been a zone of conflict\r\nfor the past four decades. Peace, security, stability and\r\ndevelopment are the collective responsibility of the\r\nStates of the region. It behoves them to earnestly\r\npromote, protect and consolidate cooperative relations\r\non the basis of mutual respect for each other’s\r\nsovereignty, unity and territorial integrity, renunciation\r\nof the threat or use of force, peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, good-neighbourly relations and peaceful\r\ncoexistence.\r\nSince its independence in 1993, the State of\r\nEritrea has espoused national security and development\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\npolicies and programmes based on the premise that our\r\nsecurity and development interests are closely linked to\r\nregional security and prosperity. To this end, it actively\r\nengaged itself in the revitalization of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\r\nand the propagation of IGAD’s new mission. IGAD is\r\nnow fully engaged in peacemaking and conflict\r\nresolution and coordinating cooperative efforts among\r\nits member States. In this context, my delegation\r\nwishes to extend special thanks to President Daniel\r\narap Moi of Kenya and President Ismail Omar Guelleh\r\nof Djibouti for their dedicated, unbiased and untiring\r\nefforts to bring peace to the Sudan and Somalia\r\nrespectively.\r\nThe search for durable peace, security and\r\nstability must be the collective commitment of all\r\nmember States of IGAD and it must be anchored solely\r\nin the welfare and best interests of the peoples\r\nconcerned. Peace in Somalia is vital, and it should not\r\nbe held hostage by any Government under the pretext\r\nof preserving its national security. History and the\r\nSomali people will make them responsible if they\r\nbecome an obstacle or try to hinder peacemaking\r\nefforts in the region.\r\nThe world welcomed the signing of the\r\nAgreement on Cessation of Hostilities, a\r\ncomprehensive peace Agreement between Eritrea and\r\nEthiopia. It has expressed the hope that the\r\nimplementation of the Agreement will proceed\r\nsmoothly and will lead to a durable peace.\r\nBoth countries owe it to their people and to the\r\nentire international community to establish a durable\r\npeace as soon as possible. We face the challenge of\r\nmeeting the hopes and great expectations of our people\r\nand of the international community. Eritrea solemnly\r\nreiterates not only its abiding commitment to the peace\r\nAgreement and its speedy implementation, but also its\r\nundertaking to fully cooperate with all its partners in\r\nthe peace process.\r\nThe peace process has made significant progress.\r\nHowever, I should like to inform the Assembly that key\r\nprovisions of the peace Agreement remain\r\nunimplemented because the Government of Ethiopia\r\nhas failed to comply with its obligations. It has, to date,\r\nobstructed the establishment of the temporary security\r\nzone and the establishment of a direct air route\r\nbetween the capitals of the two countries. Moreover, it\r\nhas refused to submit operationally useful information\r\non its minefields in the temporary security zone and to\r\nrelease civilian detainees and war prisoners.\r\nIt has also resumed the deportation of Eritreans\r\nand Ethiopians of Eritrean origin, in blatant violation\r\nof the comprehensive peace Agreement between the\r\ntwo countries. The last round of deportation occurred\r\non 25 June 2001 and was strongly condemned by the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea\r\n(UNMEE) and the International Committee of the Red\r\nCross.\r\nUnder these circumstances, it is surprising that\r\nEthiopia has recently accused Eritrea of placing its\r\narmy on high alert and of deploying its troops along the\r\ncommon border. This baseless accusation, refuted by\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Representative in\r\nEritrea and Ethiopia, is designed to hide Ethiopia’s\r\nplans and intentions to sabotage the peace process by\r\nprovoking hostilities.\r\nThe Government of Eritrea has consistently\r\nundertaken, in good faith, to comply fully with the\r\nprovisions of the Algiers Agreement, in spite of the\r\nintransigence of the Government of Ethiopia and its\r\nviolation of it.\r\nThe Government of Eritrea wishes to extend\r\nsincere appreciation to, and applauds the effort of, the\r\npeace partners, particularly the United Nations, the\r\nEuropean Union, the Organization of African Unity\r\nand the Governments of the United States and Algeria.\r\nIt also extends its profound thanks to the friends of\r\nUNMEE for their immense contribution to the peace\r\nprocess. At the same time, it urges the international\r\ncommunity to exert extra effort to persuade the\r\nEthiopian Government to fulfil its legal obligations\r\nunder the Algiers peace Agreement and the United\r\nNations Charter without delay.\r\nEritrea has always been consistent in its\r\ncondemnation of terrorism, irrespective of the\r\nperpetrators or victims. It has itself become the victim\r\nof terrorist attacks by elements organized, financed,\r\ntrained and armed by the Ethiopian Government. These\r\nterrorists are often joined by Ethiopian troops and\r\nmilitias in their heinous crimes against innocent\r\ncivilians. We urge the international community to\r\ncondemn these barbarous acts and to demand that the\r\nEthiopian Government cease its activities and hostile\r\nacts as soon as possible.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nIn conclusion, despite its regrettable experience\r\nwith the United Nations in the early days, Eritrea is\r\nfully convinced that the Organization has played a\r\ncrucial role in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security and has contributed immensely to the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights, as well as to\r\neconomic development and social progress.\r\nEritrea is fully and unequivocally committed to\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. To this end, we\r\nbelieve that the United Nations must proceed with a\r\nprocess of change and reform that will reinforce the\r\nprinciple of equality among all its Members and\r\nguarantee its impartiality and neutrality. Hence, we\r\nfully endorse the position of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement on membership of the Security Council and\r\nthe question of a periodic review of its structure and\r\nfunctions. We are confident that much will be achieved\r\nunder the visionary leadership of Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nduring his second term of office.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Antonieta Rosa Gomes, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and International Cooperation of the Republic\r\nof Guinea-Bissau.\r\nMrs. Gomes (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in\r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation):\r\nAllow me, on behalf of the Government of Guinea-\r\nBissau and its delegation, to express sincere\r\ncondolences to the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States and to the people and Government of the\r\nDominican Republic for the tragic event of 12\r\nNovember in New York , resulting in great loss of life.\r\nAllow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, which will certainly\r\nbe crowned with success thanks to your experienced\r\ndiplomatic skills and deep understanding of this\r\nuniversal Organization.\r\nThe delegation of Guinea-Bissau, which I have\r\nthe honour of heading, would like to assure you at this\r\ntime of its full cooperation in carrying out your noble\r\nmandate. I also extend my warm congratulations to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, on the\r\nconstructive way in which he led the work of the last\r\nsession.\r\nIn addition, I would like to reaffirm my\r\nGovernment’s confidence in and regard for the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his clear\r\nleadership of the United Nations and his incessant\r\nsearch for peaceful and realistic solutions to the\r\nvarious conflicts and problems that affect humanity.\r\nThe Nobel Peace Prize, awarded in October to\r\nour Secretary-General and to the United Nations, which\r\nhe so ably leads, proves not only his commitment to the\r\nattainment of peace and security, but also his important\r\nrole of working in the interests of humanity. For this\r\nreason, I extend to him my most sincere\r\ncongratulations and wishes for success in the second\r\nterm of office to which he was elected, and encourage\r\nhim to continue his efforts to reform and adapt the\r\nOrganization to the needs of our time, in the service of\r\npeace, progress and international cooperation.\r\nIn this vein, I urge the widening and deepening of\r\nthe reforms already undertaken and appeal once again\r\nfor a reform of the Security Council to increase the\r\nnumber of both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembers and to bring the right of veto into line with\r\nthe needs of today.\r\nThis first General Assembly session of the\r\ntwenty-first century represents, as was stated in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, a historic challenge for the\r\nbuilding of new international relations. At the\r\nMillennium Summit, our dignitaries worked hard to\r\nenvision the role that the Organization must play in the\r\ntwenty-first century. They solemnly reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment to the noble ideals of the United Nations,\r\nas well as their conviction that the role of the United\r\nNations is indispensable in the service of peace,\r\nprogress and international cooperation, and in support\r\nof the primacy of law. During that event, our heads of\r\nState and Government also discussed new perspectives\r\nfrom which to confront the great challenges of\r\nglobalization for the promotion of a new international\r\nhuman order.\r\nIn this context, the year 2001 was marked by\r\nimportant international conferences: the recent World\r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,\r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, which took place\r\nin Durban, and whose final Declaration not only\r\ndefines slavery as a “crime against humanity” but also\r\nlaunches an appeal for appropriate and efficient\r\nmeasures to reverse the consequences of slavery. It also\r\nrecognizes that those “historical injustices” contribute\r\nto poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social\r\nexclusion, economic disparities and the insecurity of\r\nmany peoples, especially in developing countries.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nDespite those prospects for a new historical\r\nperspective, this session takes place at a moment of\r\ndeep disquiet for our countries and peoples. In fact, the\r\nwave of attacks perpetrated on 11 September this year\r\nagainst the Pentagon in Washington and the World\r\nTrade Center in New York, just a few kilometres from\r\nthe Assembly, is reason for great concern for my\r\nGovernment and the President of the Republic,\r\nMr. Kumba Yalá, who promptly and strongly\r\ncondemned the cowardly terrorist acts perpetrated\r\nagainst the United States of America. Today I reaffirm\r\nbefore the Assembly our unreserved condemnation of\r\nterrorism in all its forms, wherever or whenever it\r\noccurs and whatever its origins, since it constitutes a\r\nthreat to security, peaceful relations between States,\r\ndemocratic institutions and the fulfilment of human\r\nrights.\r\nToday more than ever before, it is necessary to\r\nadopt a broad strategy for the entire international\r\ncommunity to combat terrorism. In that context,\r\nGuinea-Bissau appeals for greater international\r\ncooperation on the issue of terrorism, specifically,\r\nthrough the ratification of already existing regional and\r\ninternational instruments and the approval, within the\r\ncontext of the United Nations, of a comprehensive\r\nconvention that covers all aspects of terrorism, from a\r\nuniversally accepted definition to its suppression.\r\nIt is in precisely this regard that my country,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, became a party to the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity Convention on the Prevention and\r\nCombating of Terrorism, adopted in 1999 at Algiers,\r\nand to the Dakar Declaration on this same scourge,\r\nissued last October. We are determined to accelerate\r\nthe ratification and implementation processes of all the\r\nagreements that seek to fight terrorism.\r\nThe beginning of the twenty-first century, which\r\ncoincides with the threshold of the new millennium, is\r\nmarked by areas of tension and armed conflict that\r\nthreaten peace and security and fuel the proliferation of\r\nand illicit traffic in small arms. In this context, the\r\nsubregional and regional organizations, with the\r\nsupport of the international community, through the\r\nUnited Nations, are fully engaged in the search for\r\npolitical solutions to conflicts. From Sierra Leone to\r\nAngola, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\r\nBurundi, from Somalia to Kosovo, from East Timor to\r\nthe Middle East, the ghosts of conflict still hover as we\r\nseek to find solutions to existing conflicts.\r\nAt present in Sierra Leone, a country of our\r\nsubregion, the Lomé Agreement, concluded under the\r\nauspices of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates (ECOWAS), and the subsequent success of the\r\nUnited Nations-supported programme for disarming the\r\nparties involved in the conflict, allow us to hope for a\r\nlegitimate peace.\r\nIn Angola, a member of the Community of\r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries, cruel and destabilizing\r\nacts continue to take place, causing enormous pain to\r\nour Angolan brothers, who have endured the nightmare\r\nof four decades of war. I would like to express our\r\nsolidarity with the Angolan people and Government,\r\nand appeal for dialogue as part of the solution to that\r\nconflict.\r\nIn East Timor, with the elections for the\r\nConstituent Assembly already held, an important step\r\nwas taken in the transition to the independence that\r\nwill be proclaimed in May next year, and towards its\r\nacceptance as a fully fledged member of global society.\r\nWe hope that the international community will\r\ncontinue to offer its valuable assistance to our Maubere\r\nbrothers, who can finally aspire to rebuild their country\r\nin peace.\r\nIn the Middle East, the conflict between Israel\r\nand Palestine is at the crux of the situation. It is in that\r\ncontext that we appeal to the parties, in accordance\r\nwith the Mitchell plan, to implement the accords\r\nwithout delay and reaffirm the fundamental principles\r\nestablished at Madrid and Oslo, as well as the\r\nsubsequent agreements. This requires the parties to\r\nabstain from all actions that endanger the peace process\r\nand all activity that is contrary to international law.\r\nFinally, the embargoes imposed upon certain\r\ncountries, such as Cuba, continue to be a source of\r\nconcern because of their very negative repercussions\r\non the vulnerable populations of those countries, above\r\nall women and children. The populations involved\r\nappeal for dialogue with a view to a definitive solution\r\nto those issues.\r\nThe sombre scene characterized by areas of\r\nconflict and tension in the world, particularly in Africa,\r\nplaces on us a moral obligation to continue to act with\r\neven greater determination and courage to end those\r\nconflicts and the sources of those tensions. Along these\r\nlines, allow me to congratulate the Secretary-General,\r\nKofi Annan, on his last report on the causes of conflict\r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\ndevelopment in Africa, a document of great interest for\r\nthe African continent.\r\nThe global economic situation — particularly\r\nafter the events of 11 September — and its negative\r\nimpact, felt especially in the least developed countries,\r\nis also an issue of concern for my Government. The\r\nsolutions to the specific problems on the international\r\nagenda require not only concerted action, but also both\r\nbilateral and multilateral contacts, which Guinea-\r\nBissau has always supported. My Government believes\r\nin concerted and combined efforts with a view to\r\nfostering economic growth and full employment in a\r\nfairer global economy. Bearing in mind that a majority\r\nof African countries have agriculture as their economic\r\nbase, we appeal to our development partners, such as\r\nthe European Union, the United States and Japan,\r\namong others, to open their markets to the flow of\r\nagricultural products from our countries.\r\nBy virtue of its important mission to generate an\r\nauthentic North-South dialogue, the United Nations is\r\nour universal conscience, whose highest priority is to\r\nmeet the needs of developing countries. The\r\nprogrammes of action originating from the series of\r\nmajor conferences of the last decade and from other\r\nimportant meetings which took place this year are of\r\nspecial importance in that they contribute to identifying\r\nneeds, formulating objectives and defining strategies\r\nfor the realization of sustainable development rooted in\r\nsustainable economic growth, social justice and the\r\nprotection of the environment. We are now waiting for\r\nthose results to be translated into concrete benefits,\r\nthus opening the way for a better global economic\r\nsituation.\r\nAs all Members know, Guinea-Bissau continues\r\nto live with the effects of the absurd and disastrous\r\narmed conflict of 1998 and 1999, which, apart from the\r\nirreparable loss of human lives, caused deep trauma to\r\nour entire society and destroyed or damaged the\r\ncountry’s existing basic infrastructure. In addition, the\r\nmarked decline in foreign aid and the slump in export\r\nprices of cashew nuts, our main export commodity,\r\nconstitute the basic reason for our lack of resources and\r\nfor the increase in poverty. This runs counter to the\r\ninterests of our citizens and makes them more\r\nvulnerable.\r\nHowever, an unshakeable will to rebuild the\r\ncountry has led my Government, together with some\r\ndevelopment partners, to redouble its efforts to define a\r\nstrategy for sustainable development and to take\r\nmeasures in the realm of human rights and\r\nreconciliation. The programme for the reconstruction\r\nand rehabilitation of infrastructure and for national\r\nreconciliation, the multi-year convergence programmes\r\nfor stability, growth and solidarity elaborated in the\r\nframework of the West African Economic and\r\nMonetary Union, the programmes of demobilization,\r\nreintegration and social reinsertion of combatants, the\r\nfight against poverty, the fight against AIDS and other\r\nprogrammes are clear examples of the will and\r\ncommitment of the Government to create a new reality\r\nfor society and a new action programme intended to\r\neffect change in that society. The President of the\r\nRepublic, Mr. Kumba Yalá, is the main mentor and\r\nguarantor of those programmes by virtue of the sacred\r\nresponsibility given to him, the highest ranking\r\nofficial, by the voters of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThe programme of action requires not only\r\ninternal but also external efforts. That is why the\r\nGovernment is strengthening its cooperation with other\r\ncountries at the subregional, regional and international\r\nlevels. Despite all its efforts, Guinea-Bissau continues\r\nto need the valuable assistance of its development\r\npartners and of the international community to face the\r\ndifficult economic and social challenges that lie ahead.\r\nIn that regard, we appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to bolster its support for Guinea-Bissau and\r\nto make donors aware of the importance of\r\nparticipating actively in next year’s round table on\r\nassistance to my country.\r\nThe celebration this year of the United Nations\r\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations and of the\r\nInternational Year of Mobilization against Racism,\r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\r\nIntolerance, which coincides with the fifty-third\r\nanniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights, is a cause for satisfaction for my Government.\r\nThis is reflected in the creation of a inter-ministerial\r\ncommittee on human rights tasked with overseeing\r\nrespect for human rights in our country and promoting\r\neducation and awareness programmes on human rights\r\nissues.\r\nSince his landslide election to the presidency of\r\nthe nation, the President of the Republic, Mr. Kumba\r\nYalá, has increased his contacts at various levels, with\r\nfriendship visits to Guinea, the Gambia, Senegal,\r\nNigeria, Morocco, Sierra Leone and other countries\r\nwith the aim of strengthening cooperation and\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\ncontributing to peaceful solutions within the\r\nsubregional framework.\r\nIt is in that same spirit that the authorities of my\r\ncountry have maintained vigilance in the area of the\r\nborder with Senegal, with the objective of guaranteeing\r\nthe security and tranquillity of our populations in that\r\nnorthern zone.\r\nIn this first year of the new millennium and of the\r\ntwenty-first century, despite certain echoes of\r\noptimism, poverty and underdevelopment unfortunately\r\npersist and have been aggravated in many areas of the\r\nworld, particularly in the least developed countries,\r\namong which is Guinea-Bissau. The developing\r\ncountries, in particular the least developed among\r\nthem, continue to be marginalized in the world\r\neconomy and to be victims of extreme poverty, due\r\nmainly to decreased official development assistance, to\r\nthe lack of productive human resources, to the\r\nweakness of domestic and foreign investments, to the\r\nslump in commodity prices, to the problems of debt, to\r\nHIV/AIDS and also, obviously, to armed conflicts.\r\nTo overcome this situation it is imperative to\r\nensure the integration of developing countries into the\r\nworld economy and to oppose the marginalization of\r\nthose countries, ensuring sustainable, accelerated and\r\ndurable economic development as well as the\r\nelimination of poverty, inequality and misery. In that\r\ncontext, we are pleased at the results of the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries, which took place in May this year at\r\nBrussels. We are certain that the results of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to take place at Monterrey, Mexico, in\r\nMarch 2002, will be translated into concrete action that\r\ncan reverse those negative trends.\r\nCooperation frameworks include the Lomé\r\nConvention of the European Union and the African,\r\nCaribbean and Pacific countries; the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development; the\r\nUnited States African Growth and Opportunity Act;\r\nand the Genoa decision of the Group of 8 on the\r\ncreation of a fund for the fight against contagious\r\ndiseases and AIDS on the African continent. We look\r\nforward to the latter group’s next summit on African\r\nproblems.\r\nBecause of the particularly difficult economic\r\nsituation it faces, Africa continues to look for realistic\r\nsolutions for the continent and is giving clear proof of\r\nits determination to improve the economies of the\r\ncountries of the continent. Beyond the programmes of\r\nstructural adjustment and other development\r\nprogrammes that have been adopted for the continent,\r\nthe New African Initiative, resulting from the merger\r\nof the plans presented by the heads of State of Senegal\r\nand of South Africa, has come at an opportune time. It\r\nis an African plan for Africans that provides developed\r\ncountries a historic opportunity to forge a genuine\r\npartnership based on mutually beneficial self-interest.\r\nThe Initiative, adopted unanimously at the most recent\r\nsummit of the Organization of African Unity, held at\r\nLusaka, should be implemented with the utmost speed.\r\nWe appeal to the entire international community, and to\r\nour development partners in particular, to support the\r\nInitiative, which encompasses the relaunching of our\r\neconomies, debt reduction and the fight against AIDS.\r\nIt is regrettable that the response of our\r\ndevelopment partners has not always been\r\ncommensurate with the degree of sacrifice that has\r\nbeen endured or with the dimensions of the problems\r\nthat have been identified. That is a paradox. It is also a\r\nparadox that the decisions of major international\r\nconferences should not be reflected in practical,\r\nconcrete measures to implement those decisions.\r\nThe new collective challenge is to bring to light\r\nthe image of a world of equality, dignity, equity and\r\ninternational solidarity, all translated into economic\r\nand social cooperation and genuine social adjustment\r\nwith the human being as its central point of reference.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Estonia.\r\nMr. Ilves (Estonia): First of all, allow me to\r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan and all of\r\nmy colleagues on having received the Nobel Peace\r\nPrize. There is no doubt that without the United\r\nNations, our world would be much less secure, with far\r\nfewer prospects for resolving conflicts. I would also\r\nlike to commend the efforts that have been made\r\nduring the last few years to reform this Organization so\r\nthat it can better deal with the new challenges it has to\r\nface. In addition, please allow me, Sir, to congratulate\r\nyou on having been elected President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nAfter the terrorist attacks of 11 September, it\r\nbecame apparent that, when we are all confronted with\r\na common threat, many existing disputes and\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\ndifferences become insignificant. The United Nations\r\nMember States together have condemned the terrorist\r\nacts. It is of the utmost importance to maintain that\r\nunity and persistently to reinforce it with concrete\r\nactions. Terrorism is the ultimate challenge to our\r\ncommon values, and our struggle against that threat has\r\nonly begun.\r\nThe destruction and elimination of terrorist\r\nnetworks is a time-consuming task for which there are\r\nno instant solutions. The United Nations does,\r\nhowever, have effective measures at its disposal for\r\nfighting terrorism: the international conventions that\r\nthe United Nations has adopted over the years and the\r\nsanctions that can be applied to hamper terrorist\r\nactivities. The ratification of those conventions and the\r\nenforcement of those sanctions by every United\r\nNations Member State is, at this moment, one of those\r\ntruly important tasks that it behoves all Members to\r\ncarry out. I am glad to be able to confirm that Estonia\r\nhas either already ratified, or is the middle of the\r\nparliamentary procedures for ratifying, all of the\r\nappropriate United Nations conventions. Estonia has\r\ntaken all necessary steps to apply Security Council\r\nresolutions 1333 (2000) and 1373 (2001).\r\nEstonia has improved and intensified cooperation\r\nand the exchange of information with its neighbours\r\nand partners. We have expressed our solidarity and\r\nunreserved support to the United States in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. We have aligned ourselves with the\r\nEuropean Union’s 21 September anti-terrorist summit’s\r\nfinal document and action plan. With our neighbours\r\nLatvia and Lithuania, we have also formulated\r\ncommon measures for preventing possible terrorist\r\nattacks and for applying coordinated tactics in case we\r\nbecome the victims of terrorist activities. We have\r\nintensified international border controls and police\r\ncooperation.\r\nMany programmes that had been adopted earlier\r\nare now proving to be extremely useful in the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism. The Financial Action Task Force on\r\nMoney Laundering, for example, has given a high\r\nrating to Estonia’s anti-money-laundering legislation.\r\nA recent audit shows that Estonian banks have no\r\ncontractual relations with any organization or\r\nindividual alleged to be connected with international\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe international political atmosphere in\r\nEstonia’s immediate vicinity, the Baltic Sea region, is, I\r\nam glad to report, peaceful, which is conducive to\r\nstable development and good-neighbourly cooperation.\r\nUp to now, Estonians have hardly had to deal with the\r\ndirect results of terrorism. But this fall’s terrorist\r\nattacks were aimed directly at international peace and\r\nstability. This means that now we, too, keenly sense the\r\ndanger that faces us all. This places the United Nations,\r\nas the world Organization, at the centre of the ongoing\r\nstruggle.\r\nThe reform processes launched during the last\r\nfew years to reorganize and reform the United Nations\r\nare also appropriate for dealing with current problems.\r\nNow, however, we must ask ourselves if there is some\r\nway that we can speed up and intensify these reforms\r\nso as to better deal with the urgency of the prevailing\r\nsituation. In our new situation, I would bring forth\r\nthree well-worn and proven principles that apply not\r\nonly specifically to the United Nations, but to other\r\naspects of international cooperation as well.\r\nFirst, we must once again ask ourselves how\r\nexactly each of us can make the most fruitful\r\ncontribution. Secondly, what can we do to increase the\r\nefficiency of the Organization? And thirdly, I would\r\nlike to stress the principle of openness.\r\nFirst of all, let us deal with the matter of every\r\nMember’s individual contribution. The United Nations\r\nbrings together Member States with a wide range of\r\nresources and capabilities. Even the most successful\r\nnation’s reserves and capacities, however, have a limit.\r\nTherefore, it is only natural that every Member State\r\ncarefully evaluate how it can be the most useful. It is\r\nequally important for Members to realistically assess\r\nhow high a level of development they have achieved,\r\nand, when appropriate, to refrain from accepting aid in\r\nfavour of those who need it the most.\r\nThis is the flip side of development. As one rises\r\nout of poverty and underdevelopment, one should also\r\ngrow up and become more responsible, acknowledging\r\nthat obligations rise along with living standards. Last\r\nyear, for example, Estonia decided to relinquish its\r\nright to pay reduced contributions to the peacekeeping\r\nbudget. For Estonia, to give up the rights to such a\r\ndiscount was not a step taken lightly — it was a\r\ndecision based on the Government’s realization that\r\nwith our rapid development, we had acquired new\r\nresponsibilities. The United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) had, after all, found that Estonia\r\nhad developed to the point where the UNDP could\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nterminate the activities of its mission in Estonia in\r\nDecember 2000.\r\nOf course, we miss working together with such a\r\nuseful cooperative agency as the UNDP representation\r\nin Estonia. Yet we realize quite well that there are\r\nmany regions in the world which badly need their\r\nassistance, while for Estonia the presence of the UNDP\r\nmission is no longer essential. In other words,\r\nmaintaining the representation would be irresponsible\r\non our part, as it would use resources for which there is\r\na greater need elsewhere. This means that Estonia’s\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and its agencies\r\nhas qualitatively advanced to a higher level. This has\r\nbeen clearly demonstrated by the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations Building project in Estonia. The\r\nintention is to have the representation of various United\r\nNations agencies all under one roof. The fact that the\r\nUnited Nations is gaining importance in the eyes of the\r\nEstonian public is evidenced by, inter alia, the fact that\r\nthe Estonian United Nations Association has been\r\nsteadily increasing its activities.\r\nDuring the last few years, Estonia has clearly\r\nprogressed from an aid recipient to an aid provider.\r\nThis transformation has been confirmed by, among\r\nothers, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) Development Assistance\r\nCommittee, which, in its 2000 yearbook, lists Estonia\r\nfor the first time as a donor nation. Therefore, those\r\nwho assisted Estonia during its now completed\r\ntransition phase can clearly see now that their aid has\r\nborne fruit. We, in turn, are willing to share the\r\nexperience that we have gained in the course of the last\r\n10 years. As a matter of fact, we have already\r\nestablished cooperative efforts of this nature with\r\nseveral countries.\r\nI spoke earlier about how every Member State has\r\nan obligation to evaluate how it can best help the\r\nUnited Nations in its endeavours. Of equal importance\r\nare the ongoing efforts to increase the effectiveness of\r\nthe Organization as a whole. In this light, I would\r\nemphasize two aspects: reform of the Security Council\r\nand the Brahimi report on improving United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nWe must ensure that our cooperative efforts for\r\nsolving the urgent problems confronting us do not\r\nbecome entangled in the deficiencies of the structure or\r\nthe working order of the Security Council. We all know\r\nvery well what these deficiencies are, and therefore our\r\ncommon goal is quite clear: to increase the\r\nrepresentativeness, transparency and efficiency of the\r\nSecurity Council. The enlivened discussions and the\r\nshift towards greater openness in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council give us hope. We supported the\r\nstrenuous efforts of Harri Holkeri, the General\r\nAssembly’s previous President, to intensify the\r\nactivities of the Working Group dealing with reform.\r\nWe share the view that it is time to move from\r\ndiscussions on to the negotiating phase.\r\nEstonia supports the enlargement of the Security\r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories of membership, just as we support reform of\r\nthe Security Council’s decision-making process. In the\r\nconfrontational context of the cold war, the veto in the\r\nSecurity Council was a means for the great Powers to\r\nprotect their interests. Even then it was avoided, and\r\nany light-handed use of the veto resulted in\r\ncondemnation by the international community. Now,\r\nhowever, the sense of trust among the Security Council\r\nmembers has grown immensely, and a limitation of the\r\nuse of the veto would be an appropriate reflection of\r\nthis improved atmosphere.\r\nThe composition of the Council, which still\r\nreflects the power relationships that prevailed in 1945,\r\nis another issue that cries out for resolution. From the\r\ninception of the United Nations that year until just a\r\ndecade ago, the people of my country were afforded\r\nonly rare glimpses of the goings-on at the United\r\nNations through fissures in the iron curtain. When we\r\nfinally established our independence in 1991, we\r\nemerged into the international arena only to discover\r\nthat the Security Council, judging by its composition,\r\nwas still stuck back in the year 1945. This strikes\r\nEstonia as being anachronistic, if not wrong-headed.\r\nThe guarantors and greatest contributors to stability in\r\nthe world have, in the course of half a century, changed\r\nfundamentally. We need not fear opening a discussion\r\non whether the moral and legal reasoning underlying\r\nSecurity Council membership in the wake of the\r\nSecond World War is still appropriate in the post-cold-\r\nwar era — or this post-11 September era. Nothing\r\nunderscores the need to come back to this question\r\nmore than the challenge that we are currently facing.\r\nParticipation in the United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations is an inseparable part of Estonia’s national\r\nsecurity policy. We therefore fully support the\r\nendeavours outlined in the Brahimi report concerning\r\nthe reformation of United Nations peacekeeping.\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nEstonia is in full agreement with the report’s\r\ncomprehensive and long-term approach to the\r\nprevention and solution of conflicts. Although we often\r\ntalk about the need for limiting expenditures, in this\r\ncase it is clear that in order to increase efficiency,\r\nmeans must be found for increasing the budget of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. We are\r\npleased to say, as I mentioned earlier, that we have\r\ncontributed to this effort to increase those\r\nexpenditures.\r\nLet me proceed to my third theme, namely,\r\nopenness. Openness and transparency are essential for\r\nmany reasons. Terrorist attacks have been directed at\r\neveryday interpersonal relations and at our usual means\r\nof communication, such as the postal system and air\r\ntravel. Therefore, we need to make concerted efforts to\r\nensure that the movement of people and ideas will not\r\nsuffer from the threat of terrorism. Terrorism itself is\r\nfed primarily by misinformation, disinformation and\r\nmisperceptions. Here too, openness is important; it is\r\nessential to communicate our intentions and ideas both\r\nto those who support us as well as to those who doubt\r\nus.\r\nOpenness is also essential in more conventional\r\nsituations, for example, in the traditional political\r\ndecision-making process, be it in the international or\r\ndomestic arena. Here, Estonia can share experiences in\r\nthe sphere of information technology. Last year, the\r\nEstonian Government began to hold its cabinet\r\nmeetings electronically. All information concerning\r\ngovernment activities now moves through electronic\r\nchannels — through the Internet. In addition to\r\nspeeding up decision-making and providing monetary\r\nsavings, information now becomes available to the\r\ngeneral public through the Internet, much faster and\r\nmore efficiently. More and more Estonians are making\r\nuse of the opportunities offered by the public sector —\r\nthe services of the revenue office, local governments\r\nand federal agencies — through the Internet. Having\r\nnow connected all Estonian public schools to the\r\nInternet, the Government also plans to bring all public\r\nlibraries online. This last summer, the Estonian State\r\nChancellery launched a unique new project by opening\r\na direct democracy portal called “Today I Decide”.\r\nThis portal allows everyone to present ideas, initiatives\r\nand proposals, as well as to comment upon proposed\r\nlegislation. New ideas that have been proposed by\r\nportal users are passed on to the appropriate\r\ngovernment offices and agencies for action. Many of\r\nyou may be interested in finding out more about the\r\ninitiatives I have described, and we are more than\r\nhappy to share our experiences with you.\r\nFinally, I would like to stress the fact that the\r\ngrave events that have affected all of us in the last few\r\nmonths will not prevent us from moving ahead. Our\r\ndecisiveness and sense of unity have only been\r\nreinforced by what has happened. We must not discard\r\nor forget all the common projects initiated before 11\r\nSeptember. In many parts of the world, nothing has\r\nchanged for those who suffer from poverty, hunger and\r\npersecution. Thinking about our projects for the future,\r\nI am especially pleased that the United Nations special\r\nsession on children, which was postponed owing to the\r\nterrorist attacks, will nevertheless take place in May\r\nnext year. The goal of this upcoming special session, to\r\ncreate better conditions and opportunities for children\r\neverywhere, continues to be of the utmost importance\r\nto us. It is precisely for initiatives of this kind, which\r\nendeavour to achieve a better future for mankind, that\r\nthe United Nations Organization has earned the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize.\r\nIn conclusion, please allow me to express my\r\npersonal condolences and the condolences of all\r\nEstonians to the families of those who perished in the\r\nair tragedy that occurred just a few days ago in the\r\nborough of Queens.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Peter Chkheidze,\r\nChairman of the delegation of Georgia.\r\nMr. Chkheidze (Georgia): Let me congratulate\r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the demanding job of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth\r\nsession. It is a fitting recognition of Korea’s role in the\r\ninternational community and of your extensive\r\nexperience and able leadership.\r\nI would also like to extend our congratulations to\r\nMr. Kofi Annan and the United Nations for the much\r\ndeserved award of the Nobel Peace Prize. It should\r\nserve as an added source of inspiration for him in his\r\nsecond term as Secretary-General and for all of us here.\r\nThe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly\r\nruns parallel to dramatic events for the development of\r\nmankind. On behalf of the Government and the people\r\nof Georgia, I wish once again to express my sincere\r\ncondolences and compassion to the American people\r\nfor the tragic events of 11 September.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nOminous threats we had been talking about for so\r\nlong have become real. Georgia, a country that over the\r\npast decade has suffered terribly from different\r\nmanifestations of terrorism, is an active participant in\r\nthe campaign against terror. The time is ripe for\r\nincreased cooperation from all States and peoples of\r\ngood will in this fight against terror.\r\nI am referring not only to cooperation in the\r\nmilitary field. Overcoming this evil requires close\r\ncooperation in development, the protection of human\r\nrights, eradicating poverty and in many other fields.\r\nToday’s realities are a lesson to mankind on the\r\nconsequences and cost of indifference and a lack of\r\nattention to what is happening all around the world.\r\nThe United Nations is certainly a unique\r\nOrganization, where we, the Member States, can shape\r\ncommon strategies to combat many of the ills and\r\nproblems of the day. These strategies and action plans\r\nare worked into various United Nations resolutions,\r\ndecisions and declarations.\r\nThe United Nations Millennium Declaration is a\r\ngreat achievement in this regard. It is virtually a pledge\r\non the part of nations to a common fight against the\r\nmanifold challenges we face today. Without any further\r\ndelay, Georgia, its people and all the peoples of the\r\nworld need a clear demonstration of readiness to\r\nimplement the commitments made in the Declaration.\r\nWe are hopeful that the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nentitled “Road map towards the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration” (A/56/326).\r\nwill become a guide for Governments around the\r\nworld.\r\nStrengthening the capacity of the United Nations\r\nin the area of conflict settlement is crucial to the\r\ncreation of a new world order based on common values\r\nand principles. The world order of the twenty-first\r\ncentury is clearly incompatible with the widespread\r\nviolations of human rights, and this could lead to a\r\ndestabilization of the international system.\r\nThe reforms should also encompass United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Georgia supports the\r\nmeasures to enhance the effectiveness of United\r\nNations preventive mechanisms. In the same context,\r\nthe early deployment of peacekeeping contingents\r\nshould be more coherent and systematic in order to\r\nquell conflicts in their early stages. The launching of a\r\npeacekeeping operation or a change in its mandate\r\nrequires the consent of all sides involved. We are\r\ninclined to think that this approach requires revision.\r\nThe cause of peace should rank as a higher priority for\r\nthe United Nations than the consent of any side\r\ninvolved in the conflict.\r\nIn the words of the Secretary-General,\r\n“the international community must remain\r\nprepared to engage politically, and if necessary\r\nmilitarily, to contain menace and ultimately\r\nresolve conflicts that have got out of hand. This\r\nwill require a better functioning of the collective\r\nsecurity system than exists at the moment. It will\r\nrequire, above all, a greater willingness to\r\nintervene to prevent gross violations of human\r\nrights.”\r\nInternal conflicts spawned by separatism are no\r\nless dangerous to international security than the\r\nconfrontations of the cold-war period or conflicts of\r\ninternational character. The reformed United Nations\r\nmust be more concrete and decisive in terms of\r\nemploying the compulsory measures provided for in\r\nChapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\r\nGeorgia fully shares the view that there is a need\r\nto improve the United Nations rapid response system.\r\nWe support the timely creation of a United Nations\r\nrapid deployment force, whose utilization in the early\r\nstage of peacekeeping operations would contribute to\r\nthe prevention of many conflicts.\r\nI would like in particular to note the work of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nother structures under the United Nations umbrella in\r\nGeorgia. Their assistance is many-faceted, and these\r\nstructures in particular are making a great contribution\r\nto the process of Georgia’s democratic transformation.\r\nHowever, a new agenda for cooperation is also\r\nrequired.\r\nI wish to underscore the joint initiative of the\r\nUnited Nations and the International Monetary Fund\r\nwith regard to creating a programme for the eradication\r\nof poverty. Georgia is one of the most active\r\nparticipants in this programme. An interesting part of\r\nits effort is the elaboration of a programme of\r\nemploying internally displaced persons in small\r\nbusinesses. All of these processes are taking place\r\nunder very difficult conditions and in an environment\r\nof numerous problems.\r\nOver the past two years the perspectives of rapid\r\ndevelopment in Georgia have been countered by the\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nabsence of progress in the peace process in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia. It is time to put an end to the spiritual and\r\nphysical suffering of the people of Georgian, Abkhaz\r\nand other nationalities who have been forced from their\r\nhomes and lands by the tragedy of war. Most\r\nimportantly, we cannot instil hatred and enmity in the\r\ncoming generations. The value of peace in the region is\r\ntoo high to be sacrificed to the political and\r\ncommercial ambitions of a single group.\r\nThe time has come to react duly to the ethnic\r\ncleansing carried out in Abkhazia, Georgia. The\r\nseparatists, with the help of outside forces, expelled\r\nabout 300,000 people from their places of residence.\r\nThe inalienable right of people to live in their\r\nhomeland is still being flagrantly trampled.\r\nOn numerous occasions Georgia has expressed its\r\ndeep concern about the presence of uncontrolled\r\nregions within the territories of the sovereign State,\r\nruled by de facto separatist regimes. The\r\nencouragement of these regimes is totally unacceptable\r\nand fraught with dangerous consequences. The tragic\r\ndowning of a United Nations helicopter over Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia, is one such heartbreaking example. I wish to\r\ntake this opportunity to once again express our deep\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims, who paid\r\nthe ultimate price for upholding the noble principles of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI would like to use this important rostrum to bring\r\nto the Assembly’s attention the danger of large-scale\r\nprovocation that Georgia is facing today. I am referring\r\nto the violation of Georgia’s airspace and the bombing\r\nof our territory. Such attacks have taken place before as\r\nwell, but, despite our protests, no adequate reaction\r\nwas forthcoming. Georgia views these acts as an\r\ninfringement of our sovereignty and an attempt by\r\nsome forces to subvert the peace process.\r\nAll of this is taking place at a time when the\r\nUnited States, together with the international\r\ncommunity, is mobilized against the most evil enemy\r\nof humankind: international terrorism. Georgia clearly\r\nvisualizes its place in this fight, and President\r\nShevardnadze has repeatedly expressed readiness for\r\ncooperation. But it is unacceptable that some States use\r\nthis noble cause of fighting terrorism as a disguise in\r\norder to reassert influence in the post-Soviet context.\r\nThe Government of Georgia reiterates its\r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict\r\nin Abkhazia, Georgia. We believe that the use of force\r\nruns contrary to our political interests, in particular the\r\ninterests of our multi-ethnic population, including the\r\nAbkhazians. At the same time, it is becoming\r\nincreasingly difficult for the Government of Georgia to\r\ndissuade those people who have lost their faith in a\r\npeaceful resolution of the conflict from using other\r\nmeans.\r\nWe are offering a special programme for\r\nresolving the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, to all our\r\npolitical partners, the Security Council and the\r\nEuropean bodies. This programme has to be\r\nimplemented without delay, notwithstanding changes it\r\nmay undergo or substantial concessions it may require\r\nfrom the parties involved in order to reach agreement\r\nand to put the programme into action.\r\nFor two years the document on the distribution of\r\nconstitutional competencies between Tbilisi and\r\nSukhumi, drafted by the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, has been kept within the confines of\r\nthe Group of Friends of the Secretary-General on\r\nGeorgia. This document has to constitute the basis for\r\nmeaningful negotiations on the scope of autonomy for\r\nAbkhazia.\r\nThe Government of Georgia is ready to grant\r\nAbkhazia the widest form of autonomy practised\r\naround the world today. Considerable international\r\nsupport is needed to restore confidence between the\r\nparties, as indicated in the Declaration of the Yalta\r\nmeeting that took place with the assistance of brotherly\r\nUkraine.\r\nLet me stress again that we attach great\r\nimportance, and we are anxious to begin discussing,\r\nthe economic rehabilitation strategy for the region. We\r\nalso look forward to carrying out projects beneficial to\r\nall and to preserving the unique Abkhaz people.\r\nWe need working relations with Russia that are\r\nboth cordial and at the same time equitable. Russia is a\r\ncountry with which we have cultural and friendly ties\r\nthat are centuries old. We can only value its special\r\nrole as the regional leader, member of the international\r\nanti-terrorist coalition, permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council and the facilitator of the peace\r\nprocess in Abkhazia, Georgia. We expect that all this\r\nwill be utilized in the best interests of all the people of\r\nGeorgia. The continuation of misunderstanding and\r\nconfrontation is unacceptable.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nWe must exert every effort to put an end to the\r\nuse of separatist regimes by certain countries as a way\r\nof exerting pressure on neighbouring nations.\r\nWe support the dialogue among civilizations as a\r\nmeans of achieving better understanding between all\r\nthe peoples of the world. We would be honoured to\r\nhost a forum dedicated to this issue. As a country on\r\nthe crossroads between Europe and Asia, Georgia, with\r\nits ancient and multifaceted culture, is an appropriate\r\nplace for such a meeting.\r\nIn closing, let me stress again that it is dialogue\r\nand cooperation that should determine the fate of\r\nmankind. For that purpose we need a United Nations\r\nwith broad, coherent and determined capabilities.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe general debate. Before making my own concluding\r\nremarks, I shall call on those representatives who wish\r\nto speak in the exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind Members that statements in the\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the\r\nsecond intervention, and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Itoki (Democratic Republic of the Congo)\r\n(spoke in French): This morning the General Assembly\r\nheard a new and regrettable tirade by the representative\r\nof the bloody Government in place in Kigali. In fact,\r\nwhat needs to be known is that under the presidency of\r\nself-proclaimed President Paul Kagame and his Akazu,\r\nRwanda has become an aggressive, terrorist and\r\nhoodlum State. At a time when there are promising\r\nprospects for a return to lasting peace in the entire\r\nGreat Lakes region — in particular with the conclusion\r\nof the second phase of the disengagement and\r\nredeployment of forces in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo — and when the Security Council has just\r\nendorsed the start of phase III of the deployment of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)\r\naccording to the concept of operations set out by the\r\nSecretary-General, the faction in power in Rwanda\r\ncontinues to distinguish itself by its retrograde and\r\nbarbaric attitude.\r\nRwanda remains the only country that has not\r\nbegun any sort of withdrawal of its forces. Namibia has\r\ncompletely withdrawn its forces from the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. Angola has already withdrawn\r\n80 per cent of its forces. Uganda and Zimbabwe have\r\nbegun the process of gradually withdrawing some of\r\ntheir units. On the other hand, and in defiance of the\r\ninternational community, Rwanda has considerably\r\nstrengthened its presence in the provinces of Kivu and\r\nManiema in order to continue to pursue a policy of\r\nterror against the Congolese civilian population in\r\nthose provinces under occupation.\r\nI would like to inform the Assembly that two\r\ndays ago in the province of East Kasai, the occupation\r\nforces opened fire indiscriminately against the\r\npopulation in a military barrage that killed and\r\nwounded numerous students, teachers and innocent\r\nbystanders.\r\nRwanda continues to try to hoodwink the\r\ninternational community under the guise of so-called\r\nsecurity concerns arising from the activities of\r\nRwandan citizens who are either part of the former\r\nregular army or members of the Interahamwe militia,\r\nwhose memory evokes such sadness.\r\nWe should point out the real reason for the\r\nvarious invasions carried out by Rwanda during more\r\nthan four years. All those invasions resulted in\r\nsenseless large-scale massacres of men, women and\r\nchildren. We can no longer count the number of\r\nextrajudicial killings, summary executions, instances of\r\ndeportation of entire populations, hostage-taking,\r\nsystematic rape, the burying alive of women, grave\r\nviolations of human rights and international\r\nhumanitarian law and the criminal and deliberate\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS. I shall stop there.\r\nHorror has become a familiar feeling for the\r\npeople of my country because of the will of the single\r\nman I mentioned and his Akazu. Mr. Paul Kagame is\r\nthe only obstacle to the return of peace to the Great\r\nLakes region. We dare to repeat that the hatred this\r\nman has for most of his own fellow citizens does not\r\npermit him to see that it has long been high time to\r\nestablish and strengthen peace, justice and democracy\r\nin our region, for the benefit of our peoples.\r\nThe representative of the bloody Government in\r\nKigali had the audacity to insult the intelligence of\r\nmembers of the General Assembly by asking the\r\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nto take part in an undertaking to murder Congolese\r\ncitizens by participating in the joint special force of the\r\nRassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie-\r\nMouvement de Libération de Congo (RCD-MLC),\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nwhich has set itself the task of tracking and crushing all\r\nopposition to the occupation.\r\nI wish to recall for the benefit of the\r\nrepresentative of Rwanda the provisions of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1376 (2001) of 9 November 2001.\r\nParagraph 11 of that resolution condemned the\r\nestablishment of that joint special force in Kindu and\r\nstressed that the disarmament of that Congolese city\r\nshould take place on a voluntary basis and in a neutral\r\nenvironment. Paragraph 12 (iv) of the resolution called\r\non Rwanda in particular to create the appropriate\r\nconditions to facilitate the voluntary disarmament,\r\ndemobilization, repatriation, resettlement and\r\nreintegration of the armed groups concerned by\r\nassuring the protection of the personal safety of the\r\nmembers of those groups, their civil rights and their\r\neconomic reintegration, including with the assistance\r\nof the donor community. One could not be clearer than\r\nthat.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to ask the\r\nrepresentative of Rwanda to faithfully convey to his\r\nmasters my demand that the city of Kisangani\r\nimmediately be demilitarized in accordance with all the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions pertaining to the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and that the\r\nRwandan mercenaries we know as the Rwandan\r\nPatriotic Front be unconditionally withdrawn. Let those\r\nevil individuals exercise their patriotism in their own\r\ncountry.\r\nThe truth is that Rwanda is in Congo for purely\r\neconomic reasons. In order to achieve its aims, Rwanda\r\nis currently trying to carry out an Anschluss of the\r\neastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. Indeed, the Rwandan authorities envision a\r\npossible annexation of the eastern territories of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo as a way of\r\nenabling Rwanda to keep part of its population outside\r\nRwanda proper while at the same time asserting the\r\nsupremacy of one ethnic group over all the other tribes\r\nof the region. As we have denounced unceasingly here\r\nat the United Nations, the objective of the Rwandan\r\nauthorities is the dismemberment of Africa in order to\r\nestablish monoethnic micro-States, gain economic and\r\nethnic dominance and control major commodity\r\nresources along a swath running from the northern\r\nmining province of Katanga, south of Sudan, and\r\npassing through the forests of the province of\r\nManiema, the Ruzizi Valley, in the province of South\r\nKivu, North Kivu and the Eastern Province. Those\r\nareas contain great quantities of natural resources and\r\nsuch strategic minerals as gold, diamonds, oil and\r\nniobium and coltan.\r\nIt must be well understood that our entire\r\npopulation has suffered far too much from this\r\nsenseless and useless war. Our entire population aspires\r\nto a peace that will make it possible for it to renew the\r\nrelations of friendship, confidence and peaceful\r\ncoexistence it previously enjoyed.\r\nThe United Nations and Africa, through the\r\nLusaka Agreement, offer a possible way out of this war\r\nof aggression. We must succeed on the political track,\r\nthrough the inter-Congolese dialogue, as well as on the\r\nmilitary track, through the programme of disarmament,\r\ndemobilization, reintegration and repatriation or\r\nresettlement and the orderly withdrawal of all foreign\r\nforces. All the belligerent parties, with the obvious\r\nexception of Rwanda, are committed to the path of\r\npeace. The community of nations would do well to help\r\nRwanda, perhaps by peaceful means, perhaps through\r\nthe application of appropriate sanctions, to get more\r\ninvolved in the process, so that all together, hand in\r\nhand, we can restore peace in our long-suffering region\r\nand create propitious conditions to enable present and\r\nfuture generations to flourish.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): Ethiopia has only one\r\nstrategic enemy. Eritrea is not that enemy; the enemy I\r\nam referring to is poverty and backwardness. We\r\ntherefore want to use all our resources, both human and\r\nmaterial, to fight poverty. However, we cannot do so if\r\nwe have a neighbour whose leadership is unable — as\r\nit has been to date — to move from being just a\r\nguerrilla movement to building a State, with all the\r\nresponsibilities that that involves. The leadership in\r\nEritrea, which is mired in a serious internal crisis, is\r\nresorting once again to actions that may lead us to\r\nunnecessary conflict. It wants to cover up its internal\r\nproblems by externalizing them. But as far as Ethiopia\r\nis concerned, we are determined not to give them that\r\nchance.\r\nThe Foreign Minister of the Eritrean Government\r\nsaid earlier that Ethiopia had failed to comply with the\r\nAlgiers peace Agreement between the two countries. I\r\nshould like to make just one or two points concerning\r\nthe Algiers Agreement, which brought about the\r\nceasefire in that unnecessary conflict. Last March,\r\nEthiopia signed what is referred to as a status-of-forces\r\nagreement with the United Nations. As I speak, Eritrea\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nhas still not done likewise. Ethiopia has allowed free\r\nmovement for the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia\r\nand Eritrea (UNMEE), but Eritrea has not. The most\r\nrecent UNMEE statement confirms that fact.\r\nThey talk about prisoners of war; it was only last\r\nweek that, through the International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross, scores of Eritrean prisoners of war were\r\nreleased. They talk about the temporary security zone;\r\nalthough it has been established, it is not functional,\r\nand they put the blame on Ethiopia. There is a saying\r\nin some parts of Ethiopia that the mother gets the\r\nblame for the father’s actions. I am not, of course,\r\ntrying to say that we are the mother — that is just a\r\nsaying. But in our societies, women and mothers are\r\nalways blamed for the faults of men and husbands.\r\nThe Agreement has not been functional, as it\r\nshould have been, because, under its terms, Eritrea was\r\nallowed to have a reasonable number of police and\r\nmilitia. The militia, by the way, are groups of peasants\r\nand farmers who are armed in order simply to protect\r\ntheir villages; they are not supposed to be armed to the\r\nteeth with mechanized vehicles and all sorts of heavy\r\nweapons. Hence, Ethiopia has said — we informed the\r\nSecurity Council today — that regular forces\r\nnumbering in the thousands are in the temporary\r\nsecurity zone, which was established under the\r\nAgreement to separate the forces. Today our two forces\r\nare not separated. We are face to face along several\r\nareas of the front, so I do not understand how we can\r\nstill call it a temporary security zone. It is not\r\nfunctional, as it should be, because the other side,\r\nwhich has been allowed to maintain its police force and\r\nmilitia, have used that pretext to bring in regular\r\nforces.\r\nI would like to provide another example. The\r\nunfortunate policies of the leadership of that State have\r\ncontinued to put the people of that country and the\r\nregion in a very dangerous situation by continuing to\r\narm and to conscript people, whereas, to date, on our\r\nside, we have demobilized over 64,000 troops. We have\r\nnot, in fact, heard about or seen anything from the\r\nother side. All we know is that they are increasing their\r\nforces, so that almost 10 per cent of their population of\r\n3.5 million is now under arms. What is the purpose of\r\nthat? It is certainly not a group of armed men going on\r\na picnic.\r\nThe Foreign Minister talked about a direct air\r\nroute between Addis Ababa and Asmara being\r\nsabotaged or subvented by Ethiopia’s refusal to put it\r\ninto operation. At one time we proposed — and the\r\nUnited Nations accepted — the idea of providing\r\nalternatives to the route that was initially suggested.\r\nThat route was the one used by our airlines when the\r\ntwo countries were one, and it passed over heavily\r\npopulated towns. One of those towns, Mekelle, was\r\nbombed in the early part of the conflict in 1998, and\r\nmore than 50 schoolchildren were killed. That is why\r\nwe do not want that direct route to be used. We\r\nsuggested — and the United Nations accepted — the\r\nidea of changing the flight path to anywhere east or\r\nwest of the original route. At one time the United\r\nNations came up with a detour that would have added\r\nless than two minutes; it was rejected by the other side.\r\nSo we are saying, here in the Assembly, that Ethiopia\r\nwill accept all routes except one, whereas they are\r\nsaying that they will reject all routes except one. I\r\nleave that issue to the judgement of the Assembly.\r\nAnother issue that was mentioned was the\r\nquestion of Ethiopia’s having failed to submit\r\noperationally useful information on minefields. We\r\nwere actually the first to submit the information on\r\nminefields. We submitted all that we have. What more\r\ncould be asked of someone who says, “We do not have\r\nany more information”? We cannot give something that\r\nwe do not have. The United Nations has accepted that,\r\nfor its own good reasons. Of course, for propaganda\r\npurposes, the other party to this unfortunate conflict\r\nwants to go after it. But there is no more minefield\r\ninformation that we have or can submit, and the United\r\nNations has accepted that.\r\nFinally, I just want to say that the war was\r\nimposed on us. Of course, they denied that, until the\r\nOrganization of African Unity organized a fact-finding\r\nmission and the former United States Assistant\r\nSecretary of State for African Affairs, in a report to\r\nCongress, stated who started it. But more devastatingly,\r\ntheir own former Defence Minister last week\r\nconfirmed that it was by order of their President that\r\nEthiopia was invaded.\r\nSo I would say that Ethiopia, like before, wants\r\npeace in order to concentrate on alleviating poverty.\r\nWe were doing precisely that before we were invaded\r\nand during the conflict and have done so since its end.\r\nIn fact, as one example, this year alone we registered\r\n8.5 per cent growth in our gross domestic product. The\r\nWorld Bank and International Monetary Fund figure\r\nfor that same period is 8 per cent.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nWe desire to continue along this route. It is\r\nEthiopia’s hope that we will be allowed to do so and\r\nthat the other party — in this case, the Eritrean\r\nleadership — will heed our advice that we concentrate\r\non working to alleviate the poverty that in fact marks\r\nboth countries, and that we work for our peoples and\r\non the peace process and not pay mere lip service to it.\r\nMr. Zackheos (Cyprus): I am taking the floor in\r\nexercise of my right of reply to the statement delivered\r\non 12 November 2001 by the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Turkey, Mr. İsmail Cem,\r\nwho, regrettably, did not hesitate to engage once more\r\nin the well-known rhetoric, replete with threats and\r\nmisrepresentations, concerning the situation in Cyprus.\r\nMr. Cem expressed the well-known exceptions to the\r\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union, referred to\r\nthe so-called realities on the island and misrepresented\r\nthe position of President Clerides with regard to the\r\nproposal made by the Turkish Cypriot leader,\r\nMr. Denktash, for face-to-face negotiations.\r\nLet me make a few things clear. First, the\r\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union is a process\r\nthat involves the European Union and the Republic of\r\nCyprus. I remind Mr. Cem that the European Union has\r\nclearly established that no third party has a right to\r\nveto Cyprus’ accession, which will be based on the\r\nmerits of its case. The European Commission, the\r\nEuropean Union member States and the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council have made it abundantly clear that\r\nthere is no legal obstacle to the membership of Cyprus\r\nto the European Union. Membership does not\r\nconstitute union with another State and thus does not\r\nviolate the provisions of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee,\r\nas claimed by Turkey.\r\nSecondly, the so-called realities are those\r\nstemming from a clear violation of international law by\r\nthe Republic of Turkey with its invasion, subsequent\r\noccupation and policy of ethnic cleansing inflicted on\r\nthe Greek Cypriot population, along with an array of\r\nhuman rights violations that have been clearly\r\ndocumented and led the European Court of Human\r\nRights to issue its landmark decision of 10 May 2001\r\nin the case of Cyprus v. Turkey, finding Turkey in\r\nviolation of articles 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 13 of the\r\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights and articles 1\r\nand 2 of its Protocol No. 1. The so-called realities of\r\nwhich Mr. Cem speaks are nothing more than the faits\r\naccomplis created by Turkey in Cyprus through the use\r\nof force and based on the forceful separation of the two\r\ncommunities of the island in pursuit of secessionist\r\naims.\r\nThirdly, with regard to the letters exchanged\r\nbetween President Clerides and Mr. Denktash, I wish to\r\ninform the Assembly that President Clerides responded\r\nimmediately, on 8 November 2001, explaining that a\r\ntête-à-tête meeting in Nicosia would be a good idea\r\nimmediately after the acceptance by both sides of the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General’s invitation to talks.\r\nLet me recall that, on 5 September, Mr. Denktash\r\nrefused the invitation of the Secretary-General to\r\nresume the process which he had abandoned a year\r\nearlier. The Security Council expressed its\r\ndisappointment on 26 September this year at the\r\nunjustified rejection of the invitation by the Turkish\r\nside. President Clerides wrote to Mr. Denktash that\r\nthey should not be abandoning the mission of good\r\noffices of the Secretary-General and the process in\r\nwhich he and his Special Representative are involved.\r\nFollowing a response from Mr. Denktash on 12\r\nNovember, in which he indicated that his aim was not\r\nto abandon the mission of good offices, President\r\nClerides expressed his readiness to have direct talks in\r\nthe presence of the representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in order to keep the Secretary-General\r\ninformed of what is being discussed and what progress\r\nis being made, so that the Secretary-General would in\r\nturn report to the Security Council. We are not yet\r\naware of any response from Mr. Denktash, but we\r\nexpress the hope that he will now display the necessary\r\npolitical will and seriously engage in negotiations in\r\ngood faith to find a just and lasting settlement to the\r\nCyprus problem within the parameters set by the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nMr. Tekle (Eritrea): I shall respect the dignity of\r\nthe General Assembly by refraining from the purple\r\nlanguage employed by the Permanent Representative of\r\nEthiopia. I also have no intention of engaging in issues\r\nthat are not germane to the statement of the Foreign\r\nMinister of Eritrea. I am not here on a propaganda\r\ncampaign and I shall be brief and focus on only two or\r\nthree issues, if only because I addressed yesterday, in\r\nanother exercise of the right of reply, most of the issues\r\nraised by the Permanent Representative of Ethiopia.\r\nAlso, I shall not engage in a discussion of the internal\r\nproblems of a country, if only because this is in the\r\npublic domain. The newspapers and the web sites will\r\ntell you what has been going on in Ethiopia over the\r\nlast six or seven months. One should take the mote out\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nof one’s eye before talking about the chaff in someone\r\nelse’s.\r\nWe heard that the United Nations Mission in\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) has been happy with\r\nthe information given to it by Ethiopia with respect to\r\nlandmines. Now I shall read what the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General said in regard\r\nto that when asked about it in one of his interviews:\r\n“We are pressuring everybody to give us\r\nlandmine information. Eritrea has given us\r\nrecords for mines. Ethiopia has given us several\r\nhundred maps. We have never hidden the fact that\r\nwe have been persuading Ethiopia to continue to\r\ncooperate with us in order that we can get all the\r\nrecords, all the maps, all the information they\r\nhave so we know where these mines are, so\r\npeople can live there safely.”\r\nNow the Ethiopian Government does not want to\r\ngive the necessary information on landmines for a\r\nsimple reason: it does not want the people who have\r\nbeen displaced by this aggression to go back to their\r\nvillages and their farms.\r\nThe issues of the police and militia and of\r\ndemobilization were also handled by my delegation\r\nyesterday. The second issue concerns the direct air\r\nroute between Addis Ababa and Asmara that had been\r\nrequested by UNMEE. UNMEE proposed an air route.\r\nWe accepted it; Ethiopia rejected it. Ethiopia claims\r\nthat it has offered alternative routes.\r\nFirst, contrary to what had been asserted, these\r\nalternative routes are not deviations of an insignificant\r\nquantity. They are deviations of 10 to 15 minutes, and\r\n8 minutes in one direction. This information was given\r\nto the Security Council by the Eritrean delegation this\r\nmorning.\r\nSecondly, what the Ethiopian Government is\r\nproposing are the routes that these planes had taken to\r\nattack the Port of Massawa, kill people, bomb the\r\nelectricity supply and Asmara itself, using a route from\r\nwhich they hit civilian centres and the airport, where\r\none of the pilots, Colonel Bezabeh Petros, was\r\ncaptured.\r\nThe President: Ethiopia has again requested to\r\nexercise the right of reply. I call on the representative\r\nof Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): We have already made\r\nour points. What we want is to fight poverty. We do not\r\nwant to engage in polemics here. We do not want to\r\ndignify the other party by doing so. We would like to\r\nleave it to you and the Assembly here to judge.\r\nThe President: The general debate at the fifty-\r\nsixth session of the General Assembly has come to an\r\nend. Before closing it, I would like to make some\r\nconcluding remarks.\r\nThe general debate of this session has been held\r\nin a most extraordinary setting, unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of the United Nations, in the aftermath of the\r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September. As I said in my\r\nopening remarks a week ago, in view of the seriousness\r\nof the circumstances, I think this general debate bears\r\nfor all of us a special meaning and a heightened sense\r\nof responsibility. Thus I am particularly pleased and\r\nheartened to see a very successful conclusion to the\r\ndebate.\r\nWe had the honour of hearing statements by a\r\ntotal of 188 speakers. Among them were 31 heads of\r\nState, 11 heads of Government, 9 Deputy Prime\r\nMinisters and 96 Foreign Ministers. I would like to\r\nextend my deep appreciation to all of them for\r\nhonouring this Assembly by their participation as well\r\nas active and constructive contribution to the debate. I\r\nam also grateful for their cooperation in efficiently\r\nconducting the meetings under such unusual\r\narrangements as the extended meeting hours and the\r\nlimited time for statements.\r\nThe issues we have addressed during the last\r\nweek were of great importance and urgency,\r\nparticularly in light of the current international\r\nsituation. Secretary-General Kofi Annan began by\r\ngiving us an excellent outline of his priorities for the\r\ncoming years, along with a review of the fundamental\r\nguiding principles of the United Nations.\r\nAlmost without exception, speakers during the\r\ngeneral debate highlighted the need for concerted\r\ncommon action to combat terrorism. A majority\r\nwelcomed the swift response of the United Nations to\r\nthe 11 September terrorist attacks and expressed\r\nsupport for General Assembly resolution 56/1, as well\r\nas Security Council resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373\r\n(2001). A number of delegations also underscored their\r\nsupport for the current military campaign in\r\nAfghanistan. Many expressed the view that a broad-\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nbased post-Taliban Government should be established,\r\nrepresenting all the Afghan people.\r\nAmid widespread emphasis on the need for\r\neffective multilateral cooperation to address the\r\nimmediate threats posed by terrorism, the importance\r\nof directly linking the wider goals of the United\r\nNations with the fight against terrorism was also\r\nrecognized. In this regard, it has often been stressed\r\nthat terrorism can be eliminated only if the conditions\r\ncreating a fertile breeding ground for it, such as\r\npoverty and social and economic marginalization, are\r\nremoved. Some speakers also pointed out that a lack of\r\ndemocracy and persistent violations of human rights\r\ncould lead to the emergence of terrorist movements,\r\nwhile others saw a link between acts of terrorism and\r\nthe lack of progress in resolving long-standing\r\ndisputes, particularly with regard to the Middle East\r\nconflict. As for the role of the United Nations in\r\ncounter-terrorist activities, several specific ideas have\r\nbeen presented, including one to establish a centre for\r\ncoordinating assistance to States in resolving crises\r\ncaused by terrorist acts.\r\nThe question of the definition of terrorism was\r\nalso a major theme. There was general agreement that\r\nacts of terrorism could never be justified, regardless of\r\nthe cause, motive or perpetrator. However, some\r\ndelegations made the point that any definition must\r\ndistinguish between acts of terrorism and acts in the\r\nexercise of the legitimate right to self-determination\r\nand defence against foreign occupation. In this regard,\r\nI would like to remind Member States that at the end of\r\nthe plenary debate on measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism in early October, I requested the\r\nSixth Committee to expedite its work with a view to\r\nconcluding the pending conventions on international\r\nterrorism. I would like to appeal once again to all those\r\nconcerned to exercise flexibility and strengthen\r\ncooperation so that we do not lose the momentum\r\ncreated thus far.\r\nThe broad consensus on addressing terrorism\r\nwent hand in hand with recognition of the need to deal\r\nin parallel with the many concerns that were on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda before the events of 11\r\nSeptember and that are often at the root of conflict and\r\nsocial disintegration. These include the fight against\r\npoverty, underdevelopment, inequality, disease, and\r\nother economic and social problems.\r\nIt was widely agreed that the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, adopted by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment one year ago, provides a valuable\r\nblueprint for tackling global issues and that the\r\ninternational community needs to proceed\r\nexpeditiously with its implementation. A number of\r\ndelegations welcomed the Secretary-General’s road\r\nmap in particular as providing useful guidance in\r\nimplementing the Declaration.\r\nMany speakers drew attention to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as a focal point of multilateralism,\r\nespecially in the aftermath of the attacks of 11\r\nSeptember, and as a forum for cooperation in pursuing\r\nthe objectives of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nEmphasis was placed on the central position of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the need for continuing reform\r\nof the Organization in order to enable it to deal\r\nsuccessfully with both old and new challenges.\r\nOn the economic and social side, concern was\r\nexpressed that the current global economic downturn\r\nmade the achievement of the poverty reduction goal\r\nmore difficult. In addition to a resumption of economic\r\ngrowth, meeting this objective would require the\r\nmobilization of new resources for economic and social\r\ndevelopment. The need to deal more effectively with\r\nglobalization was highlighted, along with the\r\nimportance of humanizing this trend, encompassing,\r\ninter alia, the United Nations role in international\r\ncooperation in response to globalization.\r\nAs the impact of the economic slowdown is felt\r\nmost acutely by developing countries, especially the\r\nleast developed counties, it is therefore even more\r\nurgent to address issues relevant to this problem. These\r\ninclude the continuing lack of full access to markets of\r\ndeveloped countries for products from the developing\r\ncountries, especially agricultural and textile, and other\r\ntrade barriers; insufficient and declining volumes of\r\nofficial development assistance; unsatisfactory levels\r\nof foreign direct investment; and unsustainable debt\r\nlevels.\r\nMany speakers saw in the just-concluded\r\nministerial meeting in Doha an opportunity to tackle\r\nimbalances in the international trade system. It is\r\nparticularly noteworthy that the World Trade\r\nOrganization member States agreed to name the new\r\nround of multilateral trade negotiations the Doha\r\nDevelopment Round. I believe that the new trade round\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.57\r\nwill be able to provide powerful impetus to global\r\neconomic growth.\r\nLikewise, high expectations were expressed with\r\nregard to two conferences scheduled for 2002: the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. Both are expected to provide strong\r\nsupport for implementing the goals of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe threat of HIV/AIDS was also a focus of\r\nconcern. A number of delegations welcomed the\r\nachievements of the General Assembly special session\r\non HIV/AIDS of June 2001 and commended the\r\nSecretary-General for his initiative to establish a\r\nGlobal Fund for HIV/AIDS and other diseases. All\r\nrelevant actors were called upon to contribute to this\r\nfund so as to support developing countries in their fight\r\nagainst the pandemic.\r\nConcerning the role of information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICT) in an era of\r\nglobalization, it was widely acknowledged that these\r\ntechnologies offer new opportunities for many\r\ndeveloping countries, but that, at the same time, greater\r\nefforts are needed to deal with the digital divide. In this\r\nregard, the United Nations ICT Task Force should be a\r\ncatalyst in harnessing the potential of information and\r\ncommunication technologies for development.\r\nSeveral speakers welcomed the adoption, by the\r\nthirty-seventh summit of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment as an expression of leadership for\r\nAfrica’s development, and a number of countries\r\npledged their support for its implementation.\r\nThe general debate has also witnessed renewed\r\ncommitment to gender equality and the implementation\r\nof Beijing and Beijing+5, as well as the Convention on\r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen. Several delegations highlighted national\r\naction to ensure equality of opportunity for women and\r\nmen, while others called for programmes and measures\r\nfor the empowerment of women, including in the\r\nreconstruction of Afghanistan.\r\nFinally, let me remind the Assembly that my\r\nintention in these remarks was to offer a brief personal\r\nobservation on the general debate, recognizing that a\r\nmore thorough presentation would not be in keeping\r\nwith my duties. I regret that it is not possible for me to\r\nreflect in these short remarks the rich ideas, profound\r\ninsights and far-reaching vision that have been\r\npresented by some of the best minds of our world.\r\nI would like to emphasize, therefore, that we\r\nshare the responsibility to maintain and nurture the\r\nspirit of commitment and cooperation at the high\r\npolitical level that has been demonstrated in the general\r\ndebate. We should direct our future work in the plenary\r\nand the Main Committees in such a way as to best\r\nreflect the concerns, hopes and aspirations expressed\r\nby all delegations over the past week. I trust that our\r\ncollective commitment will ensure that this task is\r\nsuccessfully completed.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy gratitude to the representatives of all Member\r\nStates who have expressed support for my presidency,\r\nalong with their kind words addressed to me and to my\r\ncountry.\r\nLast but not least, I wish to thank once again, on\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, the United States\r\nGovernment and our host city, New York, for their\r\nhospitality and security arrangements during the\r\ngeneral debate. My heartfelt thanks also go to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral Chen Jian and his able team, and all United\r\nNations security personnel, as well as the entire staff of\r\nthe Secretariat, for their untiring devotion and\r\noutstanding professionalism.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 9?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.\r\n"
