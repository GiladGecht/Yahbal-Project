(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 97 (continued)\r\nSustainable development and international economic\r\ncooperation\r\n(c) High-level dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership\r\nMr. Manalo (Philippines): At the outset, please\r\naccept my delegation’s congratulations on your\r\nelection, as well as the assurances of our fullest\r\ncooperation in ensuring the success of this high-level\r\ndialogue and of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAllow me also, Mr. President, to take this\r\nopportunity on behalf of my government to extend to\r\nthe city of New York and the people and Government\r\nof the United States of America our deepest\r\ncondolences on the barbaric terrorist attacks of last\r\nweek. We stand with the United States and the\r\ninternational community in condemning last week’s\r\noutrage. We also wish to associate ourselves with the\r\nstatement of Iran on behalf of the Group of 77 earlier\r\nthis morning.\r\nThis dialogue takes place at a crucial time. As the\r\nmechanism for the follow-up to the Agenda for\r\nDevelopment, we have the opportunity to assess how\r\nthe agreed outcome has withstood the test of time, in\r\nparticular how our objectives have fared in their\r\nimplementation. As a result of the lessons learned, we\r\ncan also look forward to applying our experience in\r\norder to work towards successful outcomes at the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. In this respect, our theme for this\r\ndialogue “Responding to globalization: facilitating the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy in the twenty-first century” also, indeed,\r\nencompasses the objectives of both the financing for\r\ndevelopment and the World Summit for Social\r\nDevelopment (WSSD) processes.\r\nDuring our meeting, we must keep foremost in\r\nour minds the idea that the objective of development is\r\nnot only economic growth, but also concrete and\r\nsustainable improvements in the quality of the lives of\r\nthe majority of humanity over time, in both absolute\r\nand relative terms. Our goal at this high-level dialogue\r\nand the task of this organization, insofar as\r\ndevelopment is concerned, is to provide the political\r\nimpetus for the fulfilment of the developmental\r\ncommitments, particularly those enshrined in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. My delegation also looks\r\nforward to this dialogue as being an input to both the\r\nfinancing for development and WSSD preparatory\r\nprocesses.\r\nTowards this end, my delegation wishes to make\r\nthe following points:\r\nFirst, we must continue to foster a holistic and\r\nsustainable approach to development, taking into\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\naccount individual peculiarities and circumstances. We\r\nmust develop a new consensus model of development\r\nthat takes into account the views, needs and priorities\r\nof all partners in development, particularly the\r\nrecipient developing countries, who are, after all, the\r\nobject of development. This new consensus model of\r\ndevelopment is what many hope will emerge as one of\r\nthe major outcomes of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development.\r\nSecondly, my delegation believes that it is each\r\ncountry’s primary responsibility to pursue its unique\r\ndevelopment process. At the same time, we recognize\r\nthat, in many cases, the indigenous capacity of\r\ndeveloping countries to pursue development efforts,\r\nincluding competing in the global economy, may be\r\ninsufficient because the international environment and\r\ncommunity play a significant role in influencing the\r\npace and direction of development, especially in this\r\nage of globalization.\r\nThe international community should, therefore,\r\ntaking into account the diversity among nations and\r\nspecific country circumstances, promote an\r\ninternational environment conducive to development\r\nand the integration of developing countries in the\r\nglobal economy. This effort should also be geared to\r\nmaximizing the sustainability of development efforts,\r\nboth with respect to maintaining long-term economic\r\ngrowth, as well as in managing the resulting impact on\r\nthe environment and the social infrastructure.\r\nAchieving this would also contribute to ensuring and\r\nmaintaining international peace and security. We\r\nshould also avoid, as one development expert has\r\nnoted, “overdetermining development” by setting forth\r\nan abundance of prescriptions that, in the final\r\nanalysis, say that everything development brings is a\r\nnecessary input to achieving it.\r\nThirdly, the participation of developing countries\r\nin international economic decision-making processes\r\nshould be enhanced.\r\nFinally, we must ensure that as we discuss the\r\nbridging of the digital divide, we do not neglect the\r\nimportance of strengthening domestic economic\r\nfundamentals, which in most developing countries are\r\nlinked to external economic developments and factors.\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): I\r\nwould like to begin by warmly congratulating you on\r\nyour election as President of the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I am convinced that under your\r\nguidance the work of this second high-level dialogue\r\non strengthening international economic cooperation\r\nfor development through partnership will be a great\r\nsuccess.\r\nAllow me to reiterate Tunisia’s condolences to\r\nthe American people and Government following the\r\nterrorist attacks that occurred last week. My delegation\r\nalso fully endorses the statement made this morning by\r\nthe Chairman of the Group of 77. My delegation is\r\npleased that this second high-level dialogue is being\r\nheld and we are also pleased with the judicious\r\nselection of the items included on our agenda, which\r\nare at the core of the concerns of the international\r\ncommunity. Coming in the wake of the Millennium\r\nSummit and on the eve of important events, such as the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, which will include a 10-year review of\r\nthe implementation of the recommendations of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Environment and\r\nDevelopment and is scheduled to be held in South\r\nAfrica in 2002, this dialogue takes on a particular\r\nimportance. It will provide an excellent opportunity to\r\ndiscuss the strategy for the millennium, a strategy\r\ndesigned to create a climate that will be favourable to\r\nthe development and integration of developing\r\ncountries in the globalized economy, to eliminating\r\npoverty and cutting in half the percentage of people in\r\nthe world whose income is less than one dollar a day\r\nby the year 2015, and to promoting access to the\r\nmarkets of the North of the products of the countries in\r\nthe South — an order which, in short, will establish a\r\nmore just, more humane and more equitable world\r\neconomy, where the benefits of globalization will be\r\ndistributed equally and equitably.\r\nThe world has entered a new millennium and yet\r\nit has still not been able to solve the inexorable\r\nproblems of poverty and underdevelopment. The\r\nrealization of economic well-being for all is one of the\r\nprimary objectives of the United Nations, and one that\r\nis far from being achieved. We note with bitterness the\r\npersistence of many signs of lack of respect for the\r\ndignity of man.\r\nAlso, in many countries, and especially in Africa,\r\npeople continue to suffer from a number of scourges,\r\nsuch as epidemics, malnutrition, armed conflict and\r\ncivil wars — scourges which appeal to the human\r\nconscience and demand the establishment of a true\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\npartnership between or among all nations based on\r\nshared development and solidarity.\r\nIn the face of this situation, Tunisia’s President\r\nhas, since 1989, spoken here on the need to reflect on\r\nan international contract for peace and progress to\r\nbuild a better future for the international community.\r\nWe are, in fact, convinced that progress in the area of a\r\nsustainable development will not be accomplished\r\nunless there is a partnership between the North and the\r\nSouth based on the principle of shared but\r\ndifferentiated responsibility.\r\nIt augurs well that the Millennium Summit\r\ndeclared solidarity a basic, fundamental  value among\r\nthe values that should govern international relations in\r\nthe twenty-first century. Leaders of the entire world\r\nhave also stressed the urgency of taking action to fight\r\npoverty. This is the framework for the proposal made\r\nby President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to create a world\r\nsolidarity fund to help eliminate poverty and promote\r\nsocial and human development in the poorest areas of\r\nthe world. This proposed world solidarity fund is an\r\ninstrument which will complement or add to the\r\nvarious existing mechanisms and should be financed by\r\nvoluntary contributions and grants.\r\nTunisia has launched this initiative on the basis of\r\na national experience which proved effective and\r\nwhich made it possible to reduce poverty, which is\r\nestimated today at around 6 per cent, through\r\nsolidarity. We are pleased to see that the General\r\nAssembly has greeted this initiative favourably in its\r\nresolution 55/210, and we invite all Member States of\r\nthe United Nations and international institutions to\r\ncontribute to making this project a reality on the\r\noccasion of this fifty-sixth session so that we may\r\nfurther solidarity and peace in the world.\r\nWe cannot have development without\r\ndevelopment financing. Tunisia therefore attaches great\r\nimportance to the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development which is scheduled to take\r\nplace in Monterrey, Mexico, 18 to 22 March 2002. We\r\ntrust that this conference will provide an opportunity\r\nfor discussing the various aspects of financing for\r\ndevelopment and that important decisions and\r\nconclusions will be adopted that will take into account\r\nthe concerns of developing countries. Among these\r\nconcerns are those relating to reversing decline in\r\nofficial development assistance, foreign debt, and\r\ncapital fluctuations and the volatility in direct private\r\ninvestments. This conference should also make it\r\npossible to put in place a new international financial\r\ninfrastructure that will provide for ways to prevent,\r\nmanage and settle financial crises.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his annual report,\r\nA/56/1, stressed that information and communications\r\ntechnologies are a good way of drawing the potential\r\nbenefits from globalization. We note, however, that\r\ndeveloping countries have not been able to profit fully\r\nfrom the fast-paced progress in these areas in recent\r\nyears. The global nature of this new environment and\r\nthe unequal pace of its development — sometimes\r\nreferred to as the digital divide — make it essential that\r\nwe set up an international dialogue and implement\r\nglobal approaches to facilitate adaptation to this new\r\nreality and to improve the involvement of developing\r\ncountries in the global information network.\r\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General is\r\nlaunching a United Nations study group on information\r\nand communications technologies as a result of the\r\nhigh-level debate in the Economic and Social Council\r\nin July 2001. The main task of this group will be to\r\nexploit the various possibilities provided by\r\ninformation and communications technologies.\r\nWe believe that efforts to close the digital divide\r\nwill be intensified on the eve of worldwide summits\r\nwhich are to be organized by the United Nations\r\nsystem, in close cooperation with the International\r\nCommunication Union (ITU), in Geneva in 2003 and in\r\nTunis is 2005. The choice of Tunisia to host the second\r\nphase of this summit shows the desire of the\r\ninternational community to reduce the technology gap\r\nbetween the North and the South and to foster\r\ndevelopment, peace and justice — which is the mission\r\nof the United Nations in all regions of the world.\r\nAfrica is assuredly a continent that deserves\r\nspecial attention on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. The Millennium Summit clearly stressed\r\nthis need and invited the United Nations system to play\r\nthe role of a catalyst in mobilizing resources for the\r\ndevelopment of this continent and its integration into\r\nthe global economy. African countries have made\r\nenormous sacrifices to undertake the structural reforms\r\nof their economies and to guarantee the success of their\r\ndevelopment plans on the basis of their own resources.\r\nHowever, political, economic and social challenges\r\nfacing the continent are such that it has been\r\nimpossible for it to ensure its own development\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nwithout the cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity, especially of the United Nations.\r\nWe would like, therefore, to reiterate our appeal\r\nfor increased mobilization in favour of the\r\ndevelopment of Africa and for the establishment of a\r\ntrue international partnership. We stress the need to\r\nproceed with complete or partial cancellation of the\r\nAfrican debt and converting it for financing\r\ndevelopment projects and projects to fight poverty and\r\nprotect the environment. We believe that it is vital that\r\nthe international community adopt specific measures to\r\npromote trade and commerce and to ensure that Africa\r\nwill profit from advances in new technologies and in\r\ninformation and communications, as well as from the\r\ninvestment and capital flows.\r\nWe are convinced that our discussions in plenary\r\nas well as at roundtables and in informal working\r\ngroups, with the participation of non-governmental\r\nplayers, will enable us to arrive at important decisions\r\nwhich will be on a level with the commitments made at\r\nthe Millennium Summit and will meet the aspirations\r\nof our peoples for progress and for prosperity.\r\nMr. Motomura (Japan): Please accept our warm\r\ncongratulations, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly.\r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of\r\nJapan, I extend my profound sympathy and\r\ncondolences to those who suffered losses in the recent\r\nterrorist attacks, as well as to all the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America. Japan\r\ndeplores the heinous acts of terrorism that were\r\nperpetrated against the United States on 11 September.\r\nThese acts must be considered not only as assaults\r\nagainst the United States, but as crimes against\r\nhumanity.\r\nToday I would like to comment on three issues\r\nthat are related to the strengthening of international\r\neconomic cooperation for development through\r\npartnership and the integration of developing countries\r\ninto the world economy.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to point out that the role\r\nof information and communication technologies (ICT)\r\nin helping the international community to cope with\r\nglobalization is indispensable. ICT has the potential to\r\nincrease productivity and to create and sustain\r\neconomic growth and employment. In the light of this\r\npotential, it is important to ensure that everyone can\r\nbenefit from ICT. In this regard, I recall that you, Sir,\r\nmentioned in your initial address as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that\r\n“the General Assembly can make useful\r\ncontributions by calling global attention to the\r\nneed for bridging the digital divide.” (A/56/PV.1)\r\nI fully support your view on this matter.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to refer to the\r\nannouncement made by the Government of Japan in\r\nJuly 2000 of the worldwide “Comprehensive\r\nCooperation Package to Address the International\r\nDigital Divide”, for which it will make available a total\r\nof $15 billion over five years. Since then, Japan has\r\ndispatched dialogue missions to countries such as the\r\nPhilippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia,\r\nSingapore, Viet Nam, Malaysia, South Africa and\r\nTunisia. Japan has also participated actively in the\r\nDigital Opportunity Task Force. The objective of these\r\nefforts is to eliminate the digital divide by ensuring that\r\ndeveloping countries do not fall behind in their\r\ndevelopment efforts, and that everyone benefits from\r\nthe potential of ICT. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to say that Japan looks forward to the\r\nsuccess of the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety, to be organized by the International\r\nTelecommunication Union (ITU).\r\nMr. Baialinov (Kyrgyzstan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe second issue I would like to comment on is\r\nthat of financing, both public and private, for\r\ndevelopment. As we are all aware, official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) plays an important role\r\nin the public financing of development. Japan has been\r\nthe top donor of official development assistance for\r\nalmost a decade, having provided a total ODA of more\r\nthan $100 billion during that time. At present, however,\r\nthe Government of Japan is reviewing its overall\r\neconomic policies, including its ODA, under Prime\r\nMinister Koizumi’s “structural reforms without\r\nsanctuaries” policy. The reason why Japan has\r\nprovided approximately a quarter of the total ODA\r\nextended worldwide for almost the past decade, despite\r\nits severe economic and financial situation, is that it\r\nfully recognizes the importance of ODA in the\r\neconomic development of developing countries. Under\r\nthese circumstances, Japan is resolved to ensure that\r\nODA projects are implemented in an efficient and\r\neffective manner.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nWith respect to our response to globalization,\r\nODA has a number of important roles to play. One of\r\nthem is the humanitarian role of a social safety net. It is\r\nimportant to assist those countries having trouble in\r\nweathering the storms of globalization on their own.\r\nODA can also prime the pump for attracting\r\nprivate funds through infrastructure building. Let me\r\ngive some figures. In 2000, total ODA to developing\r\ncountries throughout the world amounted to $50\r\nbillion, while foreign direct investment (FDI) in\r\ndeveloping countries amounted to $240 billion. Thus,\r\neven this tremendous amount of ODA accounted for\r\nonly 18 percent of total FDI. Accordingly, an important\r\ngoal is to increase FDI in the developing world. ODA,\r\nwhich is less available than private funding, could\r\nsupport those measures taken by developing countries\r\nto attract foreign direct investment.\r\nIn connection with FDI, I would like to mention\r\nhere the importance of coping with a chain reaction in\r\nwhich a financial crisis in one country could affect the\r\ninternational financial system as a whole, as we\r\nobserved in the case of the Asian monetary crisis\r\nseveral years ago. In order to cope with that crisis,\r\nJapan adopted an approximately $30 billion financing\r\nscheme, called the “New Miyazawa Initiative,” under\r\nwhich some Asian countries were able to avoid\r\nexcessive dependence on short-term capital and build a\r\nlong-standing and stable financing mechanism.\r\nBilateral swap arrangements under the Chiang Mai\r\nInitiative have also been agreed upon to achieve the\r\nsame objective.\r\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, I would\r\nlike to stress the principle of “ownership and\r\npartnership”, which Japan introduced at the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conferences on African Development. It\r\nis imperative for developing countries themselves to\r\ntake appropriate measures to cope with the\r\nglobalization process. At the same time, from the\r\nperspective of partnership, developed countries, United\r\nNations agencies and international organizations, as\r\nwell as other developing countries, are required to\r\nrespond to the efforts made by the developing countries\r\nconcerned. In particular, it is important to further\r\ndeepen the dialogue with the private sector as a partner\r\nfor development because private companies are leading\r\nthe information technology revolution, and they are the\r\nsources of foreign direct investment.\r\nWhile it is my sincere hope that today’s gathering\r\nwill provide the United Nations with new perspectives\r\nin the field of development, in March 2002 we will\r\nhave an opportunity to discuss in greater depth the\r\nactions we should take in response to globalization, at\r\nthe High-level Event on Financing for Development.\r\nIn concluding my remarks, let me express the\r\nhope that our actions today will lead to a greater\r\nunderstanding of the tasks that lie before each\r\nstakeholder and also lead to productive discussions in\r\nMexico.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): As this is the first time I\r\nhave spoken in the plenary this session, let me express\r\nour outrage at, and condemnation of, the monstrous act\r\nof terrorism perpetrated recently on the host country,\r\nand express our sympathy and condolences to the\r\nbereaved, and deep regret over the immense material\r\ndamage that has been caused. We are encouraged to see\r\nthat the phenomenon of terrorism is being perceived as\r\na challenge to the international community as a whole,\r\nwhich is to show the determination to eradicate it from\r\nall parts of the world. This objective of the global\r\ncommunity is closely linked with socio-economic\r\nstability and advancement, a subject that concerns us\r\ntoday.\r\nTalking at this juncture, we have to be mindful of\r\nthe context of the protests against skewed\r\nglobalization, which have become a feature since\r\nSeattle in 1999, and indeed a serial phenomenon, seen\r\nin Melbourne, Prague, Seoul, Nice, Barcelona,\r\nWashington, Quebec City, Gothenburg and Genoa.\r\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss that phenomenon\r\nas foolish protesters or as a travelling circus of\r\nprofessional rioters and anarchists. It is true that on\r\nsuch occasions such elements see an opportunity for\r\nunfortunate, irresponsible and provocative behaviour,\r\nwhich then tends to receive media attention. Hopefully,\r\na remedy can be found for that. However, we should be\r\nmore mindful of the mood of disquiet and concern at\r\nthe direction of globalization that that phenomenon\r\nrepresents.\r\nTake some of the figures that have been cited.\r\nLast year, campaigners for debt relief for the world’s\r\npoorest countries gathered 24 million names, the\r\nlargest petition in history. Just two years ago, 25\r\nprotesters turned up at the World Bank/International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) annual meeting in Washington.\r\nLast year, the figure was 30,000. At the end of this\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nmonth, for the truncated World Bank/IMF meeting —\r\nnow cancelled — activists were predicting the presence\r\nof more than 50,000. A survey this summer in Le\r\nMonde showed that 56 per cent of people in France\r\nthought that multinational corporations had been the\r\nbeneficiaries of globalization; only 1 per cent thought\r\nthat consumers and citizens had benefited.\r\nThere are many areas of concern, such as\r\ndomination of the profit motive, the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment, the lopsided advantage to those well\r\nplaced to exploit the forces of globalization, the neglect\r\nof what should be the predominant poverty agenda and\r\nthe lifting of lives of the poor, the erosion of\r\nconfidence in the democracy and priorities of\r\ninternational institutions, the political influence of\r\nmoney, the anxiety of job insecurity, the sense of\r\ngrowing inequality, the commercialization of public\r\nspaces, supra-national authorities overshadowing\r\nnational and local Governments, and a sense of\r\npowerlessness. There are many other concerns that feed\r\ninto that mood of anxiety. There is a sense that the\r\nglobal order has become dysfunctional and iniquitous.\r\nThat sense is exacerbated by the knowledge that in a\r\nglobalizing world — with its resources of expanding\r\ntrade, burgeoning investments, a foreign direct\r\ninvestment average of around $100 billion in the late\r\n1980s and $900 billion a decade later, the movement of\r\ncapital and the resources of science and technology —\r\nit should be more possible than ever before to put\r\ntogether a positive programme of change so that\r\nglobalization is seen as a tide that lifts all boats, and\r\nnot a process dividing the world into winners and\r\nlosers, advantaged and deprived, corporate benefit and\r\nindividual loss.\r\nWe should make no mistake about the fact that\r\nglobalization and global capitalism are battling today\r\nto win the argument. We in the United Nations have the\r\nresponsibility of conducting creative, constructive and\r\npurposeful deliberations to rectify the perceived\r\nshortcomings and to consider how that argument can be\r\nwon. The high-level dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational cooperation for development is taking\r\nplace at a time of renewed uncertainty about global\r\neconomic prospects on account of the significant\r\nslowdown in major economies and the resultant decline\r\nin world output and trade. This dialogue was envisaged\r\nas a forum to discuss issues concerning the\r\ninternational economic environment, and thereby to\r\npromote convergence of perceptions and advance\r\nmultilateral cooperation for development in a spirit of\r\npartnership based on mutual interests and shared\r\nbenefits. We are confident that during this dialogue\r\nthere will be stimulating and fruitful discussions on the\r\ntheme “Responding to globalization: facilitating the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy in the twenty-first century”, and on the two\r\nsub-themes.\r\nThe era of globalization and liberalization in\r\nwhich we live today promised to mankind\r\nunprecedented prosperity. It was hoped that the free\r\nflow of capital, goods and services would bring about\r\nsustained and equitable growth in all nations. This,\r\nhowever, has not happened. The benefits have accrued\r\nunevenly, resulting in a world where there is prosperity\r\nin a smaller part and poverty in the larger part, where\r\ndisparities in income and wealth between nations and\r\nwithin nations are widening.\r\nThe figures attesting to that are common\r\nknowledge. Today, 66 countries are worse off than they\r\nwere a decade ago. The Economist, in its issue of 16\r\nJune 2001, points out that there are more rich people\r\nthan ever before, including some 7 million millionaires\r\nand over 400 billionaires, while at the same time,\r\ncurrently 2.8 billion people live on less $2 a day, and\r\n1.2 billion on less than $1 a day. The average income in\r\nthe richest 20 countries is in a different world from the\r\naverage in the poorest 20. Clearly, we all need to work\r\ncollectively to reverse this trend of increasing\r\ndisparities and to ensure that globalization works for\r\nall — all nations and all segments of society.\r\nGlobalization done right — that is, supportive of\r\nthe social and economic development objectives of\r\ndeveloping countries — is what we need to ensure. We\r\nhave to make certain — the choice is not between\r\nglobalization and isolation — by coming to a common\r\nunderstanding on the terms on which equitable\r\nglobalization would progress. We must ask ourselves,\r\nif it is so self-evident that globalization is a beneficial\r\nprocess, why that is not being universally recognized.\r\nThe anxieties relate to disparities, unequal returns and\r\na sense of vulnerability. We believe that our responses\r\ncould lie in accepting the obligation of making the\r\nprocess universally acceptable by ensuring that it is\r\nuniversally beneficial. We need to look at ways and\r\nmeans by which developing countries can beneficially\r\nintegrate into the world economy.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nA number of developing countries have\r\nexperienced low growth rates in the past two decades.\r\nIt used to be thought that poor performance was due to\r\nweakness in domestic policies. But that explanation is\r\nless convincing because policies have in fact converged\r\nover the last decade. A large number of developing\r\ncountries experiencing poor growth have been engaged\r\nin structural adjustment programmes.\r\nThe domestic reform agenda is familiar to us.\r\nDespite this, performance has fallen short of what was\r\nhoped for. Part of the explanation may be inadequate\r\nimplementation at the national level, which may need\r\nto be addressed. There are, however, external\r\nconstraints that can be addressed only jointly with the\r\nworld community. This makes international dialogue\r\nmore imperative than ever; it should embrace a range\r\nof issues, from strengthening the financial architecture\r\nto creating an enabling international environment\r\nthrough concerted action on trade, debt, private capital\r\nflows, official development assistance and the\r\napplication of science and technology, including\r\ninformation and communication technologies.\r\nIn the coming period, three key events will offer\r\nus the opportunity to address the concerns of the\r\ndeveloping countries and to move towards an equitable\r\nand inclusive world economy: the Ministerial meeting\r\nof the World Trade Organization, to be held in Doha in\r\nNovember; the Financing for Development Conference,\r\nto be held in Monterrey next March and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\r\nJohannesburg next September. At these meetings we\r\nmust demonstrate the political will to achieve the goals\r\nof sustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all. We believe that our approach to\r\nthe issues that require attention should be as follows.\r\nIn trade issues, we need to address outstanding\r\nimplementation issues, including the implementation of\r\nspecial and differential clauses in favour of the\r\ndeveloping countries in various World Trade\r\nOrganization agreements. Protectionist measures and\r\ncontinued barriers in areas of priority to developing\r\ncountries, such as agriculture, textiles and clothing,\r\nshould be dismantled. The World Bank has pointed out\r\nthat in agriculture alone the trade benefit from the\r\nremoval of subsidies is envisaged to be $350 billion\r\nper annum.\r\nWe also need to examine ways and means by\r\nwhich private capital flows and foreign direct\r\ninvestment, which are becoming increasingly important\r\nas vehicles of external financial support, can be used\r\nfor increasing productive capacity and infrastructure\r\ndevelopment in developing countries. In the case of\r\nshort-term capital flows, we should seek to establish\r\nappropriate mechanisms to contain the sudden capital\r\nflights that can cause a breakdown in domestic\r\neconomies.\r\nSince private capital flows cannot be considered\r\nas a substitute for official development assistance\r\n(ODA), the developed countries should, in a time-\r\nbound manner, reverse the long decline in ODA, which\r\nhas fallen to 0.22 per cent of their GDP, and work up\r\nquickly to the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per\r\ncent. It is crucial to stress the centrality of the core\r\nsocial agenda, essential for healthy growth, as stated in\r\nthe Millennium Summit Declaration.\r\nThere is a need to build on the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Initiative, and push for wider, deeper\r\nand faster debt relief measures that would free\r\nresources from repayment cycles for use in national\r\npoverty eradication and development programmes.\r\nThis relief should be linked to market access measures\r\nto ensure sustainability.\r\nDecision-making structures through which\r\ngovernance is exercised internationally must be made\r\nbroader and equitable by accommodating greater\r\nparticipation by, and a real voice for, developing\r\ncountries. The international financial structure needs\r\nstrengthening, as does the multilateral trade regime.\r\nGreater consistency and coherence must be achieved\r\namong macroeconomics, trade, aid and financial\r\npolicies to ensure support for our common aim of\r\nexpanding the benefits of globalization.\r\nWe need to find new and innovative resources for\r\ndevelopment priorities to supplement the traditional\r\nfunds so as to achieve the international development\r\ngoals within the agreed time frame. In this context, we\r\nnote the renewed interest in the Tobin tax.\r\nThe international community must regenerate\r\ncommitment at the highest political level for the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21 by identifying\r\nconstraints and reaffirming its commitment to make\r\navailable to the developing countries new and\r\nadditional financial resources and to transfer to them\r\nenvironmentally sound technologies.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nGlobalization has been driven by new information\r\nand communication technologies. While ICT can play\r\nan important role in promoting development, there are\r\nconstraints to accessing knowledge, particularly by\r\ncitizens and institutions of developing countries. We\r\nbelieve that the ICT Task Force can play an invaluable\r\nrole in bridging the digital divide, fostering digital\r\nopportunity and firmly putting ICT at the service of\r\ndevelopment for all. We must, however, guard against\r\ncriminal networks; taking advantage of the most\r\nadvanced technologies.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to emphasize that\r\nthe United Nations, with its universal membership and\r\nability to undertake a holistic treatment, is uniquely\r\nplaced to play an important role in the debate on\r\nglobalization. We have had a most creative and\r\nconstructive interaction with the Fund and the Bank.\r\nWe further believe that we are at a moment in\r\ninternational economic discourse when significant\r\nshared ground has already been created. We are not\r\ntalking past each other, but to and with each other. We\r\nneed to build on this so that, with collective political\r\nresolve, we can consign poverty and hunger to the past\r\nand look forward to an equitable future for all\r\nhumanity.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): May I first take\r\nthis opportunity to express the profound sympathy and\r\ncondolences of the Government and people of Ghana to\r\nthe Government and people of the United States over\r\nthe death and damage caused by the terrorist acts. We\r\nare acutely aware that such actions are not only attacks\r\non our values as a civilized community but are also\r\nactions whose economic ramifications affect all\r\ncountries, especially in this era of globalization.\r\nMy delegation considers this session of the high-\r\nlevel dialogue, which is being held in a period of a\r\nglobal economic slowdown, as timely, since it provides\r\nan opportunity to draw the necessary lessons from it\r\nand define a bolder vision to match the possibilities of\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe recurrence of financial crises and economic\r\nslowdown in the midst of the market expansion driving\r\nglobalization, and the persisting levels of poverty in the\r\nface of the unlimited potential of globalization to\r\nexpand the wealth of nations, are an indication of our\r\nfailure as a world community to harness the\r\nopportunities of globalization to their fullest.\r\nMany people around the world today who should\r\nbe part of the global markets are simply existing on its\r\nmargins because they live on less than $2 a day. Many\r\nwho should contribute value to those markets are either\r\nexcluded from the value chain because they do not\r\nhave the requisite skills or are at the periphery of\r\nproductive activity which now requires new skills.\r\nOpportunities for educating a skilled labour force\r\nthrough knowledge networks and for raising the quality\r\nof life through technology-supported advances in\r\neducation, health, nutrition, crop yields and\r\nentrepreneurial activity are being squandered, as the\r\nstatistics continue to show. As a result, globalization,\r\nwhich is a process of integration of economies, culture,\r\ntechnology and governance, threatens to deepen the\r\nfissures of societies by increasing income gaps within\r\nand among nations.\r\nAddressing the challenges of globalization would\r\nrequire measures that create opportunity for all\r\ncountries and all people to participate in its processes,\r\nincluding the empowerment fostered by its easily\r\naccessed knowledge networks. Developing countries\r\nhave a particular responsibility in this regard to build\r\non their economic reform efforts of past decades to\r\nensure a sound, stable macroeconomic environment\r\ncapable of stimulating greater savings, preventing\r\ncapital flight and attracting private sector investments,\r\nboth local and foreign.\r\nEqually, we must promote conditions of\r\ngovernance based on institutions and laws to enable\r\nour citizens to thrive on their creative abilities and to\r\nreap the benefits of stability and law and order. The\r\neffective development of our human resources,\r\nparticularly through the design of forward-looking\r\ncurricula to ride the crest of innovation, must take first\r\npriority in our development efforts. These efforts must\r\ntake advantage of the work of the Information and\r\nCommunication Technology Task Force.\r\nPolitical and economic processes which promote\r\nmarket expansion at the regional level and stability are\r\nalso crucial in this respect. In this connection, the\r\nintensified efforts to achieve integration, particularly in\r\nAfrica, need to be pursued and supported to ensure\r\ntheir realization in the shortest possible time. The New\r\nAfrican Initiative, which was adopted by African\r\nleaders in Lusaka, Zambia, in July, asserts that the\r\nadvantages of effectively managed integration present\r\nthe best prospects for future economic prosperity and\r\npoverty reduction. The New African Initiative, which is\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nanchored in the fundamental principles of African\r\nownership, leadership and accountability, also\r\nrecognizes the importance of enhanced partnerships at\r\nthe international level to enable Africa to achieve the\r\nobjectives which it has set for itself.\r\nTo accept the primary responsibility for our own\r\neconomic development does not therefore mean that\r\ndeveloping countries on their own can achieve\r\nbeneficial integration into the global economy.\r\nDecisions, actions and inaction of the so-called\r\nsystemically significant economies, especially the\r\ndeveloped countries, affect in a significant manner the\r\nability of many developing countries to participate\r\neffectively in the global economy. Indeed, it is well\r\nunderstood that the most effective engagement with\r\nglobalization must be global in scope. It was in this\r\nlight that world leaders in their Millennium\r\nDeclaration, only a year ago, called for policies and\r\nmeasures which correspond to the needs of developing\r\ncountries and economies in transition.\r\nThe mix of policies necessary to sustain a\r\nsupportive external economic environment conducive\r\nto accelerated development in developing countries\r\nremains essentially the same as those contained in the\r\nDeclaration on International Economic Cooperation.\r\nNot surprisingly, the thrust of the Millennium Summit\r\nwas the recognition of the failure to achieve the\r\nobjectives which are contained in the Declaration and\r\nthe International Development Strategy for the last\r\ndecade and a determination to reverse past\r\nperformance.\r\nAn essential component of any new strategy to\r\nintegrate developing countries into the global economy\r\nmust include the strengthening of the international\r\nmonetary and financial system through greater\r\ntransparency on the part of all participants — private,\r\npublic and multilateral — in the world economy;\r\nincreased participation in decision-making in both\r\nformal and informal processes by developing countries,\r\nincluding through regional mechanisms; and\r\nmultilateral surveillance to cover all economies,\r\nincluding the major economies.\r\nThe international financial organizations will\r\nneed to go beyond promoting macroeconomic\r\ndiscipline and liberalization to support institution-\r\nbuilding in such areas as markets, law enforcement and\r\npublic governance to enable institutional convergence\r\nbetween developed and developing countries. The\r\ninternational financial institutions, as well as the\r\nUnited Nations, should, in the context of the\r\ndevelopment of markets, provide support for local\r\nprivate-sector activity through the establishment of\r\nmuch-needed long-term funds.\r\nTogether with the resources that could be\r\nleveraged through innovative public-private\r\npartnerships involving the International Finance\r\nCorporation and the multilateral and bilateral guarantee\r\nand insurance agencies, these resources would\r\nrepresent a considerable proportion of the investment\r\nneeds of the developing countries bypassed by present\r\ncapital flows. Whether this will be done depends on the\r\npolitical will of the richest nations. It is clear, though,\r\nthat unless they act, the supportive actions of the\r\ninternational community will continue to be too little,\r\ntoo late. That has been the case with respect to the\r\ncurrent measures on debt relief and international trade,\r\ntwo of the areas critical to any efforts towards\r\nintegration of developing countries into the global\r\neconomy.\r\nWe believe that debt relief policies, within the\r\ncontext of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers,\r\nshould reflect recognition of the need for those\r\ncountries to achieve growth rates of 7-8 per cent per\r\nannum. The narrow definition of indices and the long\r\ndrawn-out process of improving the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative end up being a self-\r\ndefeating exercise.\r\nIt is clear that, if debt relief is to have an\r\nenduring impact, the developed countries will need to\r\ntake decisive steps to address the concerns of\r\ndeveloping countries over the implementation of the\r\nUruguay Round undertakings, particularly the\r\nAgreement on Textiles and Clothing, the Agreement on\r\nAgriculture, the provisions concerning special and\r\ndifferential treatment, the provisions on technical and\r\nother assistance by developed countries, as well as\r\nthose issues relating to the built-in agenda. The World\r\nTrade Organization needs to be transformed to reflect\r\nthe development dimension of trade and to ensure\r\ncoherence in global policies in trade, finance and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe need to treat core policy areas as a package is\r\nnot limited to external debt and international trade. It\r\nextends to systemic issues and foreign capital flows,\r\nincluding official development assistance. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance can be made to play a more\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\npivotal role, either in the development of infrastructure,\r\nlong-term funding for the private sector or enhancing\r\nthe role of the United Nations towards the achievement\r\nof the international development goals. This can be\r\ndone if official development assistance is made to\r\nrespond to national programmes instead of to the\r\nproject approach. Taking into account the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the implementation of the\r\ndevelopment goals, it is time also to consider assessing\r\ncontributions to United Nations operational activity.\r\nIn a few weeks, the Preparatory Committee for\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment will meet to begin work on the outcome\r\ndocument. The objective of that Conference holds the\r\nkey to the successful integration of developing\r\ncountries into the global economy. An outcome that\r\nresults in partnerships to create the conditions for the\r\nmobilization of resources for the sustained growth and\r\nsustainable development of developing countries would\r\nmake globalization a positive force for all.\r\nWe must use this forum as an opportunity to send\r\nthat signal to those who would negotiate the outcome\r\ndocument. We must expect nothing less than a global\r\nconsensus which reflects both the imperative of\r\nincreasing the wealth of all nations and recognition of\r\nthe need for global solidarity in a global village.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): Like previous speakers, I\r\nwould like to begin by reiterating our expression of\r\nsympathy to the people and Government of the United\r\nStates in view of last week’s terrorist attacks. The news\r\nof the attacks has caused commotion and outrage in\r\nBrazil. We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of\r\nlife and by the suffering of thousands of innocent\r\nvictims and their families. Brazil condemns in the\r\nstrongest terms all forms of terrorism. We will continue\r\nto support the joint cooperative efforts of the\r\ninternational community, including here in the General\r\nAssembly, to eradicate these intolerable practices,\r\nwhich are utterly inconsistent with the building of an\r\ninternational order based on the principles of justice.\r\nThe concept of globalization can be interpreted in\r\nmany ways. Its consequences have been different for\r\ndifferent groups and nations. There are those who\r\nbelieve that globalization is bringing about a period of\r\nunprecedented economic growth, allowing more\r\ncountries to benefit from financial flows and the\r\ntransfer of knowledge and technology. At the other\r\nextreme of the debate, it is argued that the process\r\nunleashed by globalization has been leading us to\r\neconomic crises, increased social disparities, high\r\nlevels of unemployment and the prevalence of market\r\ncompetition over social goals. Another fundamental\r\nquestion concerns the degree of freedom of States in\r\nthe face of this new challenge and the reason why some\r\ncountries are more able to adjust to this process than\r\nothers.\r\nNobody disputes that many countries face a\r\ndramatic situation today. One third of the world’s\r\npopulation lives on less than $2 a day, and\r\nglobalization has not been able to meet the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries. Therefore, there is an urgent\r\nneed to promote and strengthen international\r\ncooperation.\r\nHow should we deal with this enormous\r\nchallenge? I believe the theme of this dialogue points\r\nin the right direction, that is, towards facilitating the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the global\r\neconomy in the twenty-first century. Actually, what we\r\nneed is not less, but more globalization — a genuine,\r\nmore inclusive and more equitable globalization. The\r\nway out is not to stop the process, but to bring in more\r\ncountries and more people. Our common efforts should\r\nbe geared to offering opportunities for those who are\r\non the fringe of globalization and do not have the\r\nconditions to benefit from it.\r\nAs Brazil stated during the preparations for the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, the key word in this process must be\r\nintegration. This long anticipated conference represents\r\none of our most important efforts to address\r\nfundamental aspects of globalization. We hope that it\r\nwill address the complexities derived from the variety\r\nof actors involved in this process and bring together all\r\nstakeholders. I mean developed and developing\r\ncountries, multilateral institutions, the private sector\r\nand civil society. We hope that the Conference will\r\nallow for the evaluation of all matters essential to\r\ndevelopment, such as trade, systemic issues, capital\r\nmovements and debt. We also hope that it will\r\ncontribute to the implementation of all development\r\ngoals set forth in the major conferences of the 1990s\r\nand the Millennium Declaration.\r\nLet me now give some examples to explain the\r\nkind of globalization of which we are most in need. I\r\nwill concentrate on three areas: trade, the international\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nfinancial system and information and communication\r\ntechnologies (ICTs).\r\nAs far as trade is concerned, we need to move\r\nfrom the rhetoric to the practice of liberalization.\r\nExport sectors of interest to developing countries are\r\nstill far from being subject to the same rules that apply\r\nto other sectors. Regrettably, protectionism persists. A\r\nnumber of tariff and non-tariff barriers severely hinder\r\nthe exports of developing countries, among them tariff\r\npeaks and tariff escalation, quotas and the abusive\r\nutilization of antidumping measures. These policies\r\nhave been used against agricultural goods, steel\r\nproducts and textiles, to mention just a few export\r\nitems. Even worse, subsidies to the agricultural sector\r\nin developed countries amount to more than $1 billion\r\na day.\r\nOver the last decade, Brazil has opened up its\r\nmarket but has not met reciprocity. If free trade is a\r\ncharacteristic of globalization, then indeed there must\r\nbe more globalization, which, in this case, means a fair\r\nworld trading system that provides developing\r\ncountries with better opportunities. Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan stated last July at the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil high-level event that the international\r\ncommunity should restore the momentum of open\r\nmarkets by launching a new round of trade\r\nnegotiations, which must be a true development round,\r\nin the sense that it would give genuine priority to the\r\nconcerns and interests of developing countries.\r\nAnother important area is that of the international\r\nfinancial system. The financial crises of the mid- and\r\nlate 1990s increased awareness regarding the adoption\r\nof sound macroeconomic policies. Brazil has\r\nimplemented these policies, which, among other\r\npositive results, have contributed to economic stability\r\nand the present flow of foreign direct investment to my\r\ncountry.\r\nNevertheless, for these domestic policies to\r\nsucceed, they must go hand in hand with an\r\ninternational enabling environment. Unfortunately, the\r\nrisks of instability continue to hover over the\r\ninternational financial system. Since all countries may\r\nbe affected, all of them should have a say in the\r\ninternational decision-making process. However, there\r\nis nowadays a participation deficit. Globalization\r\nconsists not only in the emergence of certain new\r\ntrends, but also in the need to establish appropriate\r\nframeworks for them, so that we can avoid a lack of\r\ngovernance and make it possible for everybody to\r\nbenefit. Again, what we need is more globalization, but\r\none that involves consistent and participatory\r\ngovernance of the international financial system.\r\nFinally, let me make a few comments on ICT.\r\nMuch has been said about its leapfrog effect on\r\ndevelopment. As this year’s Human Development\r\nReport shows, technology is, as never before, a\r\nfundamental tool for development and economic\r\ngrowth. ICTs allow for significant progress in areas\r\nsuch as education, health, culture, trade, agriculture,\r\nindustry, tourism, job creation and even government\r\ntransparency.\r\nIn these areas, Brazil has carried out many\r\ninitiatives, at both the domestic and the international\r\nlevels. The Brazilian Government has implemented an\r\nInformation Society Programme, which aims at\r\nexpansion of economic activities based on intensive\r\nuse of ICT and the increase in the number of Internet\r\nusers in the country.\r\nBrazil has also taken part in international fora,\r\nsuch as the United Nations Task Force, and followed\r\nclosely the developments in the DOT Force. Last June,\r\nin Rio de Janeiro, Brazil organized a meeting on ICT\r\nfor development in order to discuss this issue with\r\nother developing countries members of Economic and\r\nSocial Council and following the activities of the DOT\r\nForce. The declaration that emanated from that meeting\r\nemphasized the importance that developing countries\r\neffectively participate in international decision-making\r\nprocesses concerning information and communication\r\ntechnologies taking into account their economic,\r\npolitical, environmental, cultural and social impact.\r\nAs a matter of fact, information and\r\ncommunication technologies are a central feature in the\r\nglobalization process. It has been said that, with the\r\nadvent of ICT, many decisions can be made at the push\r\nof a button. More people should be given an\r\nopportunity to press the button of globalization. In this\r\ncase, globalization means providing developing\r\ncountries with more access to knowledge and\r\ntechnology.\r\nOne of the commonplaces used with reference to\r\nglobalization is that there is nobody in charge.\r\nHowever, the conclusion to be drawn from the three\r\nexamples that I gave is that there are institutions\r\ndealing with globalization. What we need is more\r\nintegration and more participation of developing\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\ncountries, both in the formulation and in the\r\nimplementation of international policies.\r\nGlobalization is a reality, not an ideology. It does\r\nnot create by itself foundations for hope for a better\r\nfuture for the poor. Hope now has to be recreated by\r\ndeeds. Achieving concrete progress on concrete issues\r\nis the only way to restore hope — a fundamental\r\ningredient in our still divided society, which is still\r\ndivided in unacceptable ways. Effective and clear signs\r\nthat globalization could be the foundation for more\r\nequitable development are urgently needed.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): It is with a heavy heart\r\nthat we participate in this high-level dialogue on\r\nstrengthening international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership, in the light of the\r\nrecent tragic events afflicting our host country and our\r\nhost city. On behalf of my Government and of my\r\ndelegation, I express Malaysia’s utter shock and\r\nrevulsion at and strong condemnation of the recent\r\nheinous terrorist attacks, and offer our most profound\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the\r\nUnited States and to other countries that have lost\r\nnationals as a result of those attacks. We will have\r\nanother occasion to address this matter more\r\nsubstantively.\r\nI wish to congratulate Ambassador Han on his\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession, and to assure him of our fullest cooperation.\r\nThe themes for our deliberations are particularly\r\nrelevant in the context of our times, which are\r\ncharacterized by globalization, interdependence and\r\nrevolution in the sphere of information and\r\ncommunications technology (ICT), among other areas.\r\nWe hope that this dialogue will help promote broader\r\nand deeper understanding of these issues and their\r\ninter-linkages, and that it will provide a greater impetus\r\nfor the promotion of international economic\r\ncooperation that will facilitate the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the world economy.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\nmade this morning by the Chairman of the Group of\r\n77, which highlighted comprehensively the concerns of\r\nthe developing countries in responding to the\r\nchallenges posed by globalization and in integrating\r\ntheir economies with the global economy. I wish,\r\nhowever, to make additional remarks on a few of the\r\nissues already raised by the Chairman of the Group of\r\n77, from the perspective of Malaysia.\r\nOne of the chief features of the current global\r\neconomic situation is the disadvantaged position of the\r\nSouth vis-à-vis the North in spite of the much-\r\ntrumpeted spirit of cooperation, complementarity and\r\nintegration with the global economy. Whatever changes\r\nhave taken place at the global level have not\r\nfundamentally changed the basic relationship between\r\nthe developed and the developing countries, which\r\ncontinues to be characterized by the dominance of the\r\nwealthy North and the marginalization of the poor\r\nSouth.\r\nThe adverse position of the developing countries\r\nhas been further worsened by the impact of\r\nglobalization. Under globalization, with its increasing\r\nand more institutionalized linkages with, and\r\ndependence on, the developed North, the developing\r\ncountries have become even more vulnerable to\r\nexternal factors. Nevertheless, globalization was\r\nembraced by the developing countries, first, because\r\nthe process was perceived to be unstoppable and,\r\nsecondly, in the hope and expectation that it would\r\nbenefit the South. We are beginning to realize that\r\nglobalization is not a universal remedy. It has its\r\nnegative aspects, which must be seriously addressed if\r\nevery State is to partake of the process in a meaningful\r\nway. This is important so as to ensure that the process\r\nbenefits all States, not just a select and privileged few.\r\nThe Asian financial crisis was a telling reminder\r\nthat playing by the rules of globalization, such as\r\nliberalizing the economy, does not automatically\r\ntranslate into more trade or faster growth and\r\ndevelopment for the developing countries. Nor does it\r\nensure for those countries the protection of their hard-\r\nearned prosperity. Liberalization has its attendant risks,\r\nas Asian countries bitterly learned during the financial\r\ncrisis. With that painful experience, there should be a\r\nbetter appreciation of the problems faced by the\r\ndeveloping countries in integrating their economies\r\nwith the global economy and of the need for\r\nappropriate measures to be taken to reduce the risks.\r\nClearly, the answer for the developing countries\r\nlies not in rejecting globalization, which is here to stay,\r\nbut in adjusting to the process in a way that avoids, or\r\nat least minimizes, the risks. If the process is properly\r\nmanaged, there is no reason why globalization cannot\r\nresult in a more equitable world order where wealth\r\ncan be more evenly distributed between the rich and\r\nthe poor. However, a partnership between them must\r\nfirst be forged.\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nTo that end, it is necessary for the international\r\ncommunity seriously to address a number of\r\nfundamental systemic issues so as to bring about a\r\nmore level playing field. That process should begin\r\nwith a revamping of the international financial\r\narchitecture aimed at making it more transparent,\r\naccountable and participatory, so as to enable the\r\ndeveloping countries, which constitute two-thirds of\r\nthe world, to participate more effectively in the\r\ndecision making processes at the International\r\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, among other institutions. Only in that\r\nway will the critical needs of developing countries be\r\nbrought to the fore, thus facilitating their integration\r\ninto the global economy. As an integral part of that\r\nprocess, there is a critical need to improve the\r\ninfrastructure in many developing countries, especially\r\nin the least developed among them. It is clear that the\r\nadvancement of those countries would be a major fillip\r\nfor the globalization process. Hence the importance of\r\nassisting them in the building of their infrastructure.\r\nThe Prime Minister of Malaysia, The Honourable\r\nMahathir Mohamad, has on several occasions spoken\r\nabout the need to focus on this issue at the international\r\nlevel and about the desirability of creating a dedicated\r\npool of international financing for the development of\r\ninfrastructure in the poor developing countries.\r\nOne of the most important dimensions of\r\nglobalization, one which needs to be seriously\r\naddressed, is the revolution in information and\r\ncommunications technology. The world of today is\r\nfirmly into the information age, where economics and\r\nevery other aspect of human endeavour will hinge on\r\nthe production, accumulation and application of\r\nknowledge. It is well acknowledged that ICT can play\r\nan important part in accelerating growth, eradicating\r\npoverty and promoting sustainable development in both\r\nthe developing countries and the transition economies,\r\nwhile facilitating their integration into the global\r\neconomy. Recognizing that ICT can become a powerful\r\nand effective tool for development, and in order to\r\nexploit the opportunities presented by the advances in\r\ninformation technology, the Malaysian Government has\r\nembarked on an ambitious programme for the full\r\nutilization of ICT in the country’s development. It has\r\ndeveloped an information technology hub called the\r\nmultimedia super-corridor, measuring 15 by 50\r\nkilometres and stretching from the capital city of Kuala\r\nLumpur to the new international airport. The corridor\r\noffers a conducive environment for companies wishing\r\nto develop innovative information technology and\r\nmultimedia products and services and to harness the\r\nfull potential of multimedia. The development of the\r\ncorridor is testimony to the Government’s\r\ndetermination to catapult Malaysia into the knowledge\r\neconomy in spite of the financial costs involved.\r\nUnfortunately, while the development of ICT\r\nholds out prospects for accelerated growth in a few of\r\nthe developing countries, that may not be so in many\r\nothers. This is because of the increasingly fierce\r\ncompetition for investment funds for ICT projects;\r\ntherefore, the multimedia super-corridor model in\r\nMalaysia may not be easily duplicated in other\r\ndeveloping countries. It is likely that, for a\r\nconsiderable period of time in the future, the digital\r\ndivide will continue to pose challenges for many\r\ndeveloping countries in their efforts to integrate\r\nthemselves into the global economy. That is to be\r\nexpected due to the great disparities between the\r\ndeveloped and the developing countries in the\r\nutilization of ICT. Less than 5 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation is engaged in activities related to ICT.\r\nWhile vast numbers of computers in the developed\r\nworld are Internet-connected, many countries in Asia\r\nand Africa are still grappling with severe shortages of\r\ntelephone lines, not to mention the problems of lack of\r\nelectricity and a high level of illiteracy. Unless these\r\nand related problems are tackled satisfactorily, it is\r\nlikely that the information and knowledge gaps\r\nbetween developed and developing countries will\r\ncontinue to widen and be made worse by globalization.\r\nWhat is urgently needed is nothing less than a\r\nparadigm shift. The thrust of globalization needs to be\r\nreoriented, from one that is driven by the rich and\r\ndeveloped countries to one of partnership between\r\nthem and the developing countries, taking into\r\ncognizance the concerns and interests of the latter. Its\r\nredefinition must take place through a multilateral and\r\ndemocratic process, with the informed participation of\r\nall countries.\r\nIn this regard, the United Nations has an\r\nimportant role to play. It should assume its rightful and\r\nintended role as the institutional and policy apex, based\r\non dialogue and collaborative efforts. We fully agreed\r\nwith the Secretary-General when he said last year that\r\n“we must not let the new information technologies\r\nbecome another resource that divides rich and poor\r\nnations”. We share his view that concrete and efficient\r\nactions are needed, at both the national and\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\ninternational levels, to spread information technology\r\nand its benefits to the developing world so as to ensure\r\nthat poor countries can join the knowledge-based\r\nglobal economy.\r\nIt is in this context that Malaysia welcomes and\r\nfully supports the establishment of a United Nations\r\nICT Task Force. We have always believed that\r\neffective development requires a careful balancing of\r\nthe roles of Governments and the other stakeholders,\r\nincluding the private sector, across a broad range of\r\npolicies and actions. Through both good and difficult\r\ntimes, Malaysia has always emphasized a strong\r\npublic-private partnership. This policy has enabled us\r\nto reach a higher level of international competitiveness\r\nand to participate more actively in the emerging global\r\ninformation economy.\r\nIt is our hope that the ICT Task Force will be able\r\nto bring together a broad-based coalition of multilateral\r\ninstitutions, the private sector, foundations and trusts,\r\nas well as bilateral donors, in order to mobilize\r\nresources to enable developing countries to benefit\r\nfrom the advancement of ICT. The United Nations ICT\r\nTask Force should be effectively used to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations system in promoting access\r\nto digital opportunities and to bridge the existing\r\ndigital divide.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Let me join other speakers\r\nin expressing the strongest condemnation of the\r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September. I also want to express\r\nmy condolences to the people and the Government of\r\nthe United States, and I would like to restate Norway’s\r\nfull commitment to combating terrorism.\r\nThe challenge of poverty must be met in a world\r\nwhere the speed of integration is high in all fields and\r\nwhere mutual dependence between countries and\r\nregions is becoming ever stronger. Global integration\r\ntouches many areas such as trade and technology, as\r\nwell as the environment and the social and cultural\r\nfields.\r\nThe most imminent challenge ahead of us is not\r\nto allow the poorest countries to continue to miss out\r\non the positive political, economic and technological\r\nopportunities offered by global integration. This would\r\nbe unfortunate for industrialized countries and\r\ndeveloping countries alike, as both would be unable to\r\ntake advantage of the opportunities for increased trade,\r\ninvestment and cultural exchange.\r\nOne of the most important issues facing us today\r\nis financing for development. The United Nations\r\nCentre for Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has\r\nestimated that for the year 2000 foreign direct\r\ninvestment to developing countries amounted to about\r\n$240 billion. This is more than five times the total\r\nvolume of official development assistance (ODA) from\r\nthe countries of the Organisation for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development (OECD) for the same\r\nyear, roughly estimated at between $53 billion and $54\r\nbillion, which is still low compared to what it was a\r\ndecade ago, and is definitely too low compared to the\r\nneed and the estimated targets. The new UNCTAD\r\nestimates which indicate a possible substantial decline\r\nin foreign direct investment further underline the need\r\nfor increased ODA. In fact, foreign direct investment\r\ntends to benefit the poorest countries only to a very\r\nlimited degree.\r\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the\r\ncountries with large numbers of extremely poor people\r\nare located, there is also a long-term negative trend in\r\ninvestments. Unless more resources are provided to\r\ndevelop human resources and increase the low\r\ninvestment rates, these countries will continue to be\r\nlocked into their poverty traps.\r\nOne of the main problems in many poor countries\r\nis that domestic savings are not channelled into\r\nproductive investments at home. This deprives the\r\nprivate sector of investment capital and the public\r\nsector of much-needed tax revenues. The reason is, of\r\ncourse, that investments in some countries are also\r\nseen as very risky by the countries’ own citizens. This\r\nis especially evident in Africa. In 1990 up to 40 per\r\ncent of all African private financial assets were\r\ninvested outside the continent. Reforms that can bring\r\nthese and other resources back to Africa are much\r\nneeded.\r\nThis is the purpose, for instance, of the proposal\r\nfor a multilateral set of investment rules under the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). Such rules require\r\nthat all countries accept binding WTO commitments,\r\nwhich would contribute to a more predictable\r\nenvironment for investors. In this context, the principle\r\nof equal treatment of foreign and domestic investors is\r\nimportant, and so are simple and transparent national\r\nrules, as well as a gradual reduction in protectionist\r\narrangements affecting investments. At the same time,\r\nsuch rules must allow developing countries to develop\r\ntheir own industries.\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nThere is little doubt that countries that have\r\nactively integrated into international trade and have put\r\nin place more liberal conditions for investments have,\r\nin general, seen a larger degree of poverty reduction\r\nand, on average, more positive effects on the welfare of\r\ntheir citizens than countries that have failed to\r\nimplement such policies. On the other hand, we have\r\nalso witnessed cases of premature liberalization of\r\ninvestment regimes in situations with an absence of\r\nadequate national regulatory frameworks and\r\ninstitutions, which can create considerable instabilities\r\nand eventually even have negative effects on the world\r\neconomy in general.\r\nIn this respect, sound macroeconomic policies\r\nand a well-functioning financial sector under active\r\nand qualified public supervision are indispensable\r\nfactors in securing economic stability and dealing with\r\nsuch serious economic crises. But better global\r\ncooperation and regulatory mechanisms must also be\r\nput in place, and the existing ones must be made more\r\nefficient.\r\nMore open world trade with better market access\r\nfor developing countries and increased direct\r\ninvestment is, in our view, more important for poverty\r\nreduction than development assistance, although the\r\npoorest countries, which depend on a narrow and price-\r\nsensitive range of export goods, cannot do without\r\nsubstantial aid. Protectionism in developed countries\r\ncosts developing countries at least $100 billion a\r\nyear — about twice the amount they receive in official\r\ndevelopment assistance from OECD countries.\r\nThis demonstrates that one of the most important\r\ncontributions developed countries can make to\r\nsupporting poverty reduction is to open their markets to\r\nproducts from poor developing countries. Technical\r\nbarriers to trade, in terms of standards, technical\r\nregulations and various health and safety requirements,\r\nrepresent a considerable obstacle for exporters from\r\ndeveloping countries. Protecting consumer safety\r\nwithout excluding exports from developing countries is\r\na great challenge for all of us. As regards tariffs,\r\ndeveloped countries could both walk the extra mile in\r\nthe international trade negotiations and unilaterally\r\nreduce or abolish tariffs on products from developing\r\ncountries through our Generalized System of\r\nPreferences. In this context, I would also like to\r\nmention the initiative taken by Norway and the\r\nEuropean Union to abolish all tariffs on goods from the\r\nleast developed countries, the “Everything but arms”\r\ninitiative.\r\nThere is also a need to emphasize the potential\r\nthat exists for developing countries to reduce their own\r\ntrade restrictions within the framework of the WTO. In\r\nthis respect, the next WTO round should explore and\r\ntake action on the special problems of developing\r\ncountries in order to develop as fair a set of rules as\r\npossible. There is, of course, also a need for assistance\r\nto developing countries so as to increase their capacity\r\nboth to take part in international trade negotiations and\r\nto develop national institutions and infrastructure that\r\nencourage more trade and product diversification. The\r\ndeveloped countries can contribute to this both through\r\nthe Integrated Framework for Trade-Related and\r\nTechnical Assistance and through their bilateral\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nThe provision of global public goods is both\r\ninadequate and vulnerable in the current situation. The\r\ncountries that benefit most from global integration\r\nhave a responsibility to assist the more marginalized\r\ncountries in achieving economic development, which\r\nwill enable them to contribute towards conserving\r\ncommon natural resources and fighting global crime, as\r\nwell as securing a well-functioning economic system.\r\nIn general, there is a need for more\r\ninstitutionalized cooperation on a global scale, with\r\nregard to both the environmental and the economic\r\nchallenges facing us. These efforts will complement\r\nsolutions that have been negotiated bilaterally or\r\nregionally. Where such global arrangements are already\r\nin place, it is important to provide assistance to poor\r\ncountries so that they can make better use of them.\r\nInevitably, financial and economic crises will\r\ncontinue to occur in the future. It is very important to\r\nprevent such crises from aggravating the situation of\r\nthe very poor. It will therefore be necessary to establish\r\neconomic and social safety nets that will secure\r\nfundamental needs in crisis situations. Thus, in\r\nconnection with economic restructuring, it is important\r\nto ensure that cuts in public spending do not involve\r\nreductions in programmes of special importance for\r\npoverty reduction.\r\nThe struggle for a better environment and more\r\ninclusive trade and investment regimes is bound to be a\r\nlong one. We must continue to promote the positive\r\naspects of global integration and, equally, intensify our\r\nefforts to limit its negative consequences. In this\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nrespect, Norway in principle favours a more binding\r\ninternational framework in terms of institutions that\r\nhave the responsibility for following up agreements, as\r\nwell as the mandate and the power to enforce them.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy delegation would like first of all to congratulate\r\nMr. Han on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session. We are convinced\r\nthat under his leadership our discussions on various\r\nissues over the next few months will lead to a very\r\npositive outcome.\r\nI should also like to join in the universal\r\nrepudiation of the atrocious terrorist acts perpetrated in\r\nthis city, in Washington, D.C. and in Pennsylvania on\r\n11 September, and to express to the people and the\r\nGovernment of the United States our heartfelt\r\ncondolences and solidarity.\r\nWhile fully supporting the comments made by\r\nIran on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the\r\ndelegation of Colombia would like to comment briefly\r\non several points that we believe should be taken into\r\naccount in this dialogue on the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the global economy in the\r\nnew century.\r\nThe dialogue that we are holding today — which,\r\nunfortunately, could not be held at a high level because\r\nof the events of last week — should, first and foremost,\r\nbe yet another contribution to the preparatory process\r\nfor the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, scheduled to take place in March 2002\r\nin Monterrey, Mexico.\r\nOne of the main concerns of developing\r\ncountries, especially middle-income countries such as\r\nColombia, is how to achieve and maintain over time\r\nour economic growth goals and our development\r\ngoals in a demanding international environment\r\ncharacterized by the phenomenon of globalization and\r\ninterdependence.\r\nIn Colombia we have tried to take advantage of\r\nthe opportunities offered by globalization, modernizing\r\nour institutions and opening our economy. We have a\r\nhard-working and vigorous private sector; our State is\r\nincreasingly decentralized; and civil society is\r\nparticipating more than ever before in all areas of\r\nnational life. For a number of different reasons,\r\nhowever, we have also felt the negative impact of\r\nglobalization, which, by its very nature, overwhelms\r\nand excludes many of us.\r\nWe therefore believe that one of the most\r\nimportant objectives to keep in mind throughout our\r\ndiscussion should be finding formulas to ensure that\r\nthe hard-won accomplishments and progress of some\r\ncountries are not drastically affected by international\r\neconomic and financial crises such as those\r\nexperienced in recent years.\r\nAlthough it is true that all countries are\r\nresponsible for their own development, it is no less true\r\nthat today’s interdependence makes us more vulnerable\r\nto the actions of others, especially those countries that\r\nare large enough to destabilize the global or regional\r\neconomy. Furthermore, globalization has also\r\nexacerbated some of the problems of modern society,\r\nincluding those of illicit drugs, organized crime,\r\nmoney-laundering and terrorism.\r\nOur Government is committed to working\r\nsteadfastly to deal with such phenomena. Colombian\r\nsociety has made considerable sacrifices and\r\nundertaken significant efforts in this respect. Thus, we\r\nhave the moral authority to invoke the principles of\r\nshared responsibility, reciprocity and equity, and we\r\ncount on the support and participation of all\r\nGovernments, international financial institutions and\r\nUnited Nations agencies in order to tackle these\r\nglobal problems together. In that context, economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership has\r\nan important role to play and should be strengthened in\r\nall those areas.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations should combat\r\nthe harmful effects of globalization and foster\r\ninternational cooperation so that the positive impact of\r\nglobalization can be extended to more regions, nations\r\nand peoples. Together with multilateral financial\r\ninstitutions, the United Nations should build a new\r\nframework to prevent and overcome economic crises\r\nand risks. We need a stable, orderly, transparent,\r\ncoordinated and predictable financial system under\r\nwhich we can all improve our early warning capacity,\r\neffectively control volatility in capital movements and\r\nensure sufficient liquidity to adequately support\r\ncountries most affected by crises. Another priority is to\r\ncreate social protection safety nets that can be used in\r\ntimes of financial crises.\r\nDeveloping countries will be able better to\r\nintegrate ourselves into the global economy when these\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nconditions are met: when our participation in\r\ninternational financial institutions — the World Bank\r\nand the International Monetary Fund — is more\r\nequitable; when we are able to take part in the\r\ndecisions that affect us directly; when the international\r\ntrade system is truly free, open, rules-based, secure,\r\njust, non-discriminatory and transparent; and when\r\ndevelopment is its basic priority.\r\nAnother aspect of great importance in this debate\r\nis human and technological development. Globalization\r\nand the technological revolution have sped up the pace\r\nat which the world works. It is obvious that those who\r\npossess and have access to technology today — and in\r\nparticular to information and communications\r\ntechnologies — have clear competitive advantages that\r\nenhance their development process and participation in\r\nthe global economy. The integration of developing\r\ncountries into the global economy depends to a great\r\nextent to access to technology and technological\r\ninnovations. Until our countries overcome this\r\nproblem, and until the digital divide is reduced, we will\r\nbe competing under very difficult and disadvantaged\r\nconditions. It is therefore essential to join forces and\r\nchannel the necessary resources of economic\r\ncooperation in this area to foster the creation of new\r\nproducts and processes through research and\r\ndevelopment; to encourage the use of ecologically\r\nsound technologies for producers and consumers; and\r\nto promote human development programmes to\r\nimprove the quality of education at all levels.\r\nFinally, we believe that the development goals\r\noutlined by the international community in recent years\r\nare the key objectives of our work, namely, the\r\neradication of poverty, the reduction of infant and\r\nmaternal mortality, universal education, access to\r\nreproductive health services, gender equality and\r\nsustainable development, among others. Those goals\r\nwill be feasible only if we observe the guiding values\r\nand principles underlying international relations today.\r\nSolidarity, tolerance, shared responsibility, equality,\r\nrespect for nature and, above all, freedom must prevail\r\nso that globalization benefits all of us equally.\r\nMrs. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan): Allow me also\r\nto join previous speakers in conveying our deepest\r\nsympathy and condolences to the people of the United\r\nStates of America on the tragic events that took place\r\non 11 September this year. We firmly condemn the\r\nbarbaric acts of terrorism that have taken the lives of\r\nthousands of innocent people. Those responsible for\r\norganizing these inhuman terrorist attacks against\r\ndemocracy and the free world should be punished for\r\ntheir crimes.\r\nGlobalization involves a new level of interaction\r\nand interdependence among States. However, along\r\nwith obvious benefits, globalization entails a danger of\r\nlopsided distribution of those benefits. The widening\r\ngap between developed and developing countries is a\r\nburning issue. In fact, that gap is getting bigger.\r\nDebates are under way as to the forms of involvement\r\nof both groups of countries in the process of\r\nglobalization, particularly from the point of view of\r\nsolving the problems faced by developing countries. In\r\nour view, it is very important to strengthen normative,\r\nlegislative and organizational frameworks in order to\r\nensure the stability and predictability of the world\r\neconomy.\r\nThe process of shaping the international trade\r\nsystem has made an unprecedented contribution to\r\ninternational economic growth. At the same time,\r\ndespite the progress achieved in the development of\r\ninternational trading relations, direct and indirect tariff\r\nbarriers continue to be maintained. Those barriers\r\naffect a considerable number of goods, some of which\r\nare important export items for developing countries. In\r\nthat connection, there is — in our view — a need for\r\nfurther multilateral efforts. This should be done under\r\nUnited Nations auspices and include the continuation\r\nof dialogue between participants in trade relations and\r\nthe United Nations agencies, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nso as to ensure further liberalization in the sphere of\r\ninternational trade and increase technical assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nToday, the situation with regard to the future of\r\nthe World Trade Organization provides a good example\r\nof the differences in appraising the globalization\r\nphenomenon. Kazakhstan is actively preparing to join\r\nthe Organization. Steps are being taken to bring our\r\nnational legislation in the foreign trade sphere into line\r\nwith WTO principles and rules. The WTO, uniting\r\nsome 140 States, must now be thoroughly reformed in\r\norder to really liberalize and democratize trade\r\nrelations. It should not be a controlling and selectively\r\ndiscriminating body of world trade policy.\r\nThe Bretton Woods institutions also have to be\r\nreformed. We believe that the most important goals of\r\nthe reform of the Bretton Woods institutions are to\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nensure their openness, democratization, competence\r\nand adequacy, and to improve cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations. We share the criticism of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) with regard to its\r\narm-twisting policy when loans are conditioned on\r\nmany political factors that have nothing to do with the\r\nactual economic situation. In the context of the role of\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions in the world economy, I\r\nwould like to mention the issue of integrating the\r\neconomies in transition into the world economy. The\r\nrole and importance of that group of countries,\r\nincluding Kazakhstan, in the world economy and\r\npolitics is growing.\r\nIn the second half of 1999, Kazakhstan’s\r\neconomy began to recover from the recession caused\r\nby the weak world commodity markets that emerged in\r\nAugust 1998. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth\r\naccelerated to 11 per cent in the year 2000 and the first\r\nthree months of 2001 because of growing domestic\r\nconsumption, strong exports and the economic\r\nrecovery in Russia. Today, in circumstances of\r\nincreased competition in world energy markets,\r\nKazakhstan is paying priority attention to the\r\nconstruction of oil and gas pipelines. The northern\r\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium project has been\r\nsuccessfully completed. Kazakhstan will be able to\r\ndouble, at a minimum, both its oil production and its\r\nexport deliveries to foreign markets. We also pin many\r\nof our hopes on the development of hydrocarbon\r\nresources on the Caspian Sea shelf. For that reason, we\r\nbelieve that the issue of the legal status of that sea is of\r\nfundamental importance.\r\nKazakhstan highly appreciates United Nations\r\nefforts to promote the integration of economies in\r\ntransition into the world economy and counts on\r\ncontinued cooperation with the United Nations in the\r\nsphere of consultative services and technical\r\nassistance. We appreciate United Nations support for\r\nstrengthening economic cooperation in the Central\r\nAsian region, which is vital to expanding trade,\r\nattracting investment, promoting competitive enterprise\r\nand improving employment and income prospects. The\r\nremoteness and small size of the majority of the\r\ndomestic markets in the region underscores the\r\nparticular importance of developing regional markets\r\nand promoting inter-regional trade and development.\r\nWe believe that, through trade and specialization,\r\nthe economic pie will grow to the mutual benefit of all\r\ncountries. Growing prosperity will offer new\r\nopportunities to the people of the region. Foreign\r\ninvestors will be attracted by an improved investment\r\nclimate and better business prospects. Economic\r\ncooperation will also contribute to regional stability,\r\nwhich will in turn enhance the trade and investment\r\nenvironment. Ultimately, economic cooperation,\r\ntogether with national development programmes, will\r\nserve the greater goal of achieving sustainable\r\neconomic growth and raising living standards in the\r\nregion. Countries in the region recognize the\r\nimportance of reducing policy and regulatory\r\nimpediments to the cross-border movement of goods\r\nand services. They also see the need to address\r\ntransportation, telecommunications and other\r\ninfrastructure weaknesses that limit the development of\r\nregional markets and inter-regional trade.\r\nKazakhstan continues to give priority attention to\r\nthe development of the transit transportation system in\r\nCentral Asian States and neighbouring developing\r\ncountries. We think it is important to actively pursue\r\nthe improvement of existing programmes and the\r\ndevelopment of new programmes designed to raise the\r\nefficiency of the present transit system in Central Asia.\r\nOur landlocked country and the region as a whole\r\nshould have secure, multiple points of access to the\r\nworld market. It is a matter of strengthening our\r\nsovereignty and independence.\r\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for\r\nEurope (ECE) and the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) have\r\ndevised a joint special programme for the economies of\r\nCentral Asia, encompassing all priority issues facing\r\nthe region, namely, the development of transit capacity\r\nand multiple pipeline systems, the management of\r\nenergy and water resources, environmental protection\r\nand technological growth. Such a comprehensive\r\napproach promotes better regional cooperation in\r\nCentral Asia and the integration of its considerable\r\npotential into the world economy. It serves common\r\ninterests. We urge the international donor community\r\nto actively contribute to the programme and to promote\r\nthe economic and democratic growth of Kazakhstan\r\nand other newly independent States in Central Asia.\r\nGlobalization emphasizes the integrated nature of\r\ncontemporary world processes. We are convinced that,\r\nin the conditions of a mutually interdependent world,\r\nno problem can be approached solely from the\r\nstandpoint of the interests of any one State. In view of\r\nthe importance of these processes, we support\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\ninternational efforts aimed at ensuring progress, well-\r\nbeing and security for all, and we welcome the leading\r\nrole of the United Nations in solving the problems we\r\nare considering.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, our\r\ndelegation wishes to express its deepest condolences to\r\nthe United States delegation, to the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America and to the\r\nfamilies of the innocent victims of the unprecedented\r\nacts of terrorism in New York and Washington, D.C.\r\nWe share their pain and grieve deeply with them.\r\nGlobalization is a complex and multifaceted\r\nprocess that has political, financial, economic,\r\ntechnological, humanitarian, cultural, educational and\r\nother dimensions. Developing countries and countries\r\nwith economies in transition are interested in the\r\nprospects offered by this phenomenon, which, along\r\nwith the visible positive aspects and opportunities for\r\nfaster development of their economies, also contain\r\nsome risks of their marginalization, as well as other\r\npossible risks.\r\nToday, there is no clear-cut vision of how that\r\nprocess will go. There is an understanding that\r\nglobalization should lead to the free transboundary\r\nmovement of financial and economic resources. Along\r\nwith the necessity of strengthening the banking systems\r\nof developing countries and countries with economies\r\nin transition and developing their stock markets,\r\nglobalization also requires unification of the\r\nappropriate aspects of national laws, inter alia through\r\nthe elaboration and conclusion of multilateral\r\nagreements. The adoption of such agreements would\r\nfacilitate smoother integration of the developing\r\ncountries and countries with economies in transition\r\ninto the globalizing world economy. We believe that\r\ninternational organizations, including those of the\r\nUnited Nations system, are the most appropriate place\r\nto address those issues. In that context, we welcome\r\nthe work of the World Intellectual Property\r\nOrganization (WIPO) on the preparation of two major\r\nInternet treaties, which are expected to enter into force\r\nbefore December 2001, and on the adjustment of the\r\ninternational legislative framework to facilitate\r\ne-commerce.\r\nGlobalization is not an overwhelming, ever-\r\nspreading, unmanageable process. It has many streams\r\nand aspects that can, and should, be managed in order\r\nto facilitate the positive development of globalization.\r\nThese streams of globalization can change their\r\noriginal direction, or even be reversed, when they\r\nencounter obstacles, such as military conflicts,\r\ninternational terrorism, and large-scale natural and\r\nman-made calamities, thereby leaving certain countries\r\ncut off from the mainstream of globalization.\r\nDespite the Armenian aggression and its severe\r\nconsequences, the Republic of Azerbaijan strives to\r\ncontribute to the positive development of globalization\r\nby actively participating in global, intra-regional and\r\nregional cooperation initiatives. Azerbaijan is a\r\nmember of a number of regional organizations and\r\ninitiatives, such as the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation (BSEC), the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO), the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States (CIS), the Georgia, Uzbekistan,\r\nUkraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova Group (GUUAM),\r\nthe  Eurasian transportation corridor TRASECA, and\r\nso on.\r\nFor reliable and safe transportation of the\r\nincreasing amount of oil recovered from the national\r\nsector of the Caspian Sea, my country uses alternative\r\nroutes of export pipelines. The sponsor group for the\r\nconstruction of the main export pipeline was\r\nestablished in October 2000.\r\nIt is well known that information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICTs) are the driving\r\nforce of globalization. The lack of modern ICT is one\r\nof the obstacles confronting many countries with\r\ndeveloping economies and economies in transition\r\nattempting to effectively integrate into the globalizing\r\nworld economy. The digital gap between them and\r\ndeveloped countries is widening, which hampers the\r\nprocess of globalization and leads to the\r\nmarginalization of the developing countries. To bridge\r\nthat gap developing countries and countries with\r\neconomies in transition need ICT transfers and\r\ntechnical and other forms of assistance from the\r\ndeveloped countries and relevant international\r\norganizations. In this respect, it is vitally important that\r\ndeveloped partners increase their contributions to\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) in order to\r\nreach 0.7 per cent of their respective gross national\r\nproducts and reverse the declining flows of ODA to the\r\ncountries of the South.\r\nOur delegation believes that the process of\r\nglobalization has to contribute to the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of countries, to the integrity and stability\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nof their systems of governance, to the elimination of\r\ndiscrimination in economic relations and to\r\nenhancement of the welfare of their peoples.\r\nIn October 2000, the sponsor group for the\r\nconstruction of the main Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan export\r\npipeline was established. That pipeline would\r\ncomplement two other already operational oil\r\npipelines. Additionally, the Government is conducting\r\nconsultations on the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-\r\nErzurum gas pipeline, for the export of large volumes\r\nof recovered natural gas.\r\nLike all other members of the group of\r\nlandlocked developing countries, Azerbaijan suffers\r\nfrom the lack of territorial access to the open sea,\r\nremoteness from major international markets and\r\nhigher transportation costs that inhibit the development\r\nof international trade. In order to solve these problems,\r\nthe Government, in cooperation with the European\r\nCommission, conducted in September 1998 in Baku the\r\nhigh-level International Conference on the Restoration\r\nof the Historic Silk Route, during which the Basic\r\nMultilateral Agreement on International Transport for\r\nDevelopment of the Europe-Caucasus-Asia Corridor\r\nwas signed. This Corridor has connected the\r\nparticipating countries of both continents. The\r\nInternational Secretariat of the Great Silk Route has\r\nalready started functioning in Baku. There are also\r\nideas on the creation of a Europe-Caucasus-Asia\r\ncultural corridor, which will be thoroughly discussed\r\nduring the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization seminar on culture and tourism\r\nto be held in Baku at the end of this year.\r\nThe implementation of these projects will\r\ncontribute to the economic development of the\r\nparticipating countries, strengthen economic\r\ncooperation between countries of the two continents\r\nand facilitate the realization of other related projects.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to mention that we are\r\napproaching three major international events: the\r\nMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization in\r\nDoha, Qatar; the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico; and\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa. The outcomes of these\r\nevents will have a direct impact on the development of\r\nglobalization, determining for years ahead its further\r\nspread and evolution. I would like to express our\r\ndelegation’s confidence that the concerted efforts of all\r\npartners from the North and the South will allow us to\r\ncope with the emerging global challenges and threats in\r\nthis century and to further progress and prosperity on\r\nour planet.\r\nMr. Pradham (Bhutan): Since this is the first\r\ntime my delegation is taking the floor at the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, allow me to express\r\nthe deepest and heartfelt condolences of His Majesty\r\nthe King, the Government and the people of Bhutan to\r\nthe Government and the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica on the valuable lives lost and the tremendous\r\ndamage done to property by the heinous acts of\r\nterrorism launched on 11 September in New York and\r\nWashington, D.C. Bhutan vehemently condemns these\r\ninhuman acts and declared a day of mourning the next\r\nday. In Bhutan, we held a national prayer event at\r\nwhich our King, members of the royal family, cabinet\r\nministers, officials and representatives of civil society,\r\nincluding United States citizens in the country,\r\ngathered together in a prayer session for all those who\r\nlost their lives or their near and dear ones.\r\nFor those of us who represent our countries here\r\nin New York, this is also our city. We are equally\r\naffected by this crime and we have all lost and suffered\r\nin some way or the other.\r\nBhutan has always strongly denounced the use of\r\nterrorism for the achievement of political or other\r\ngoals. In its wake, terrorism brings death, the injury of\r\nthe innocent and a disruption of normality within\r\nsocieties, and gives rise to cries for counteraction and\r\nrevenge. In other words, hatred and violence simply\r\nbreed hatred and violence. Terrorism has to be rooted\r\nout wherever it surfaces. Otherwise, our efforts here in\r\nthe international community to better the lot of human\r\nsociety by wiping out poverty, fighting against diseases\r\nlike HIV/AIDS and bringing the benefits of\r\ndevelopment through globalization will remain a path\r\nfull of obstacles.\r\nIn these most difficult of times, we are happy to\r\nsee a person of Mr. Han’s high calibre, wisdom and\r\nexperience presiding over the work of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation warmly congratulates him on\r\nhis unanimous election and will cooperate with him in\r\nevery way possible. The Republic of Korea represents\r\na people that are one of today’s greatest examples of\r\nhow poverty and underdevelopment can be overcome\r\ndespite heavy odds.\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland, on the\r\nachievements of the last session and the great personal\r\nefforts he made to make the work of the General\r\nAssembly more efficient.\r\nWhile discussing the issue of integrating the\r\ndeveloping countries into the global economy, we have\r\nto ensure that the process is equitable and beneficial to\r\nthem. We have to take the right and sequential steps\r\nthat are essential to attaining such an objective.\r\nDeveloping countries themselves are at different stages\r\nof development or are differently endowed with natural\r\nresources or other economic advantages. In this context\r\nwe have the least developed, the landlocked and the\r\nsmall island developing countries, and the economies\r\nin transition. Among the developing nations, there are\r\nthose that face the debilitating impact of HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria and intense and widespread poverty, and some\r\nof them must confront recurring natural disasters,\r\nincluding man-made calamities.\r\nFrom all our work thus far, the fundamental\r\nconclusion that we have come to is that, if the\r\ninternational community is at all to achieve the targets\r\nand objectives that it has set, it must address the\r\nquestion of resources. Overcoming the disadvantages\r\nof geography; eliminating degrading and abject\r\npoverty; winning the war against HIV/AIDS and other\r\nserious diseases; and bringing basic health care and\r\neducation to those who do not have them are the issues\r\nwhich need to be tackled with the highest priority. In\r\nmost cases, without resources from the international\r\ncommunity, these will be goals that may remain in the\r\nrealm of the impossible.\r\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the\r\ninequities arising from the digital divide, our priorities\r\nshould be clear. We must bear in mind the difference\r\nbetween what are means to an end and not confuse\r\nmeans as ends in themselves. We must be aware of the\r\nundue proliferation of activities, especially in view of\r\nthe resource constraints in the United Nations. Finally,\r\nmy delegation hopes that our work on the agenda item\r\nbeing considered will be truly meaningful in taking the\r\ndeveloping countries, on the basis of justice and equity,\r\ninto the global economy of the twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Wibisono (Indonesia): Before I begin, let me\r\nexpress the sincere sympathy and condolences of my\r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of\r\nIndonesia to the victims of the tragedy that struck this\r\ncity and nation on 11 September, as well as to their\r\nfamilies and friends. They are in our thoughts and\r\nprayers. We must also express our deep admiration and\r\nrespect for the valiant efforts of the police, firefighters,\r\nemergency workers and all engaged in the tremendous\r\ntask of rescue and recovery.\r\nIn the aftermath of the horrendous terror attack\r\nand the tremendous loss suffered by our host city, New\r\nYork, and our host country, it is now crystal-clear what\r\nconfrontation and international terrorism can lead to.\r\nSuch heinous acts cannot be tolerated. They also partly\r\nreflect a severe breakdown in communication and\r\ndialogue. We have witnessed over the past week in\r\nNew York and Washington, I believe, the enormous\r\ncost of such a breakdown. Thus, we are convinced that\r\nthere can be no alternative to coming together to\r\ncombat terrorism and to engage in sincere and genuine\r\ndialogue among all Member States. We must generate\r\ninclusive dialogue and solidarity in the face of terror,\r\nand we must seriously address the causes that continue\r\nto foment it. I strongly believe that part and parcel of a\r\ncomprehensive approach must be to seek ways and\r\nmeans of stamping out poverty, imbalances and\r\ninequality as best we can, since these often represent\r\nthe virulent breeding grounds that produce extreme and\r\nfanatical reactions resulting in devastating\r\nconsequences. It is for those reasons that we must\r\nresolve to strengthen communication and dialogue\r\namong all Member States.\r\nBefore addressing the issue before us, let me\r\ncongratulate Ambassador Han Seung-Soo on his well-\r\ndeserved election to preside over the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-sixth session. Let me also associate myself\r\nwith the statement of the Chairman of the Group of 77\r\nand China.\r\nThree years ago this month, the General\r\nAssembly held its first high-level renewal of the\r\ndialogue on strengthening international economic\r\ncooperation for development. The outcome of the two-\r\nday deliberations at that time produced several\r\nimportant conclusions. We must build upon them rather\r\nthan repeating them. To single out a few of the\r\nconclusions of that meeting, globalization was\r\nconsidered an irreversible process, and therefore had to\r\nbe carefully managed. The outcome also emphasized\r\nthat action was necessary on a global scale involving\r\nthe world’s leading economies and multilateral\r\ninstitutions. Inclusiveness and participation were\r\nimperative to promote a global civic ethic to shape the\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nrules that would ensure that globalization benefited all,\r\nincluding those currently marginalized. Therefore, the\r\ndialogue must explore ways to ensure complementarity\r\nand the creation of synergy among the various forms of\r\ncooperation at the bilateral, regional, inter-regional and\r\nmultilateral levels, involving not only Governments but\r\nalso all relevant parts of the United Nations system and\r\nother stakeholders. I hope and trust that our discussions\r\nover these couple of days will build upon those\r\nconclusions and will move forward.\r\nThe purpose of the overall theme of this year’s\r\nrenewal of the dialogue is to respond to globalization\r\nand to facilitate the integration of developing countries\r\ninto the world economy. The dialogue should be seen\r\nas part and parcel of the broader intergovernmental\r\nprocess of major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits, especially the Millennium Summit, and of the\r\nregular work of intergovernmental bodies, especially\r\nthat of the Second and Third Committees of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and that of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.\r\nAll countries, developed and developing alike,\r\nare seeking how best to increase the integration of their\r\neconomies into the global economy and to glean\r\nbenefits from it. But the process is heavily laden with\r\nrisks as well as opportunities. Free-market forces have\r\nincreasingly become the arbiter of economic policy-\r\nmaking at the global and national levels. Competitive\r\nmarkets have replaced international cooperation as the\r\ndriving force of growth and development. In\r\nconsequence, we have widening economic gaps and a\r\ndigital divide, which result in poverty,\r\nunderdevelopment and instability. Effectively\r\naddressing these worsening phenomena is our critical\r\ncollective responsibility, and we must start through\r\ngenuine dialogue.\r\nDespite important initiatives undertaken by the\r\ninternational community, such as the major United\r\nNations conferences of the early 1990s and the\r\nlaunching of an Agenda for Development, multilateral\r\ncooperation for development has continued to retreat.\r\nTherefore, we strongly believe that there can be no\r\nviable alternative to the renewal of the dialogue so as\r\nto revitalize international cooperation for development\r\nthrough a constructive North-South dialogue. The key\r\ndevelopment issues for such negotiations include trade,\r\nfinance, debt and technology, including information\r\nand communications technology (ICT), which should\r\nbe negotiated on the basis of mutuality of interests and\r\nbenefits, shared responsibility and genuine\r\ninterdependence.\r\nAs to the two sub-themes for this dialogue, on\r\ngenerating new public and private financing resources\r\nand on facilitating access to ICT for developing\r\ncountries, we strongly supported their selection for our\r\ndeliberations at this high-level meeting. We did so\r\nsince we consider them pivotal both to effectively\r\npromoting development and to enhancing the\r\nintegration of the developing countries into the global\r\neconomy. What action we must take on these themes is\r\nnow an imperative question.\r\nAs to the financing issue, we must seek ways and\r\nmeans to mobilize the private sector both at the\r\ndomestic level and in the international arena. We must\r\ncall for international assistance to help us adopt policy\r\nmeasures and strategies that make our countries\r\nattractive and conducive to private financial flows and\r\ninvestment. With regard to ICT, we must ensure that\r\nthe United Nations ICT Task Force will explore, by\r\nevery means at its disposal, significantly improving\r\naccessibility and connectivity for people, including the\r\nrural poor, and especially small and medium\r\nenterprises. To do so, we must ensure that the requisite\r\ninfrastructure, such as telephone wires, telephone\r\nsystems and community centre Internet access, are in\r\nplace.\r\nThis second high-level dialogue should also\r\nbenefit from the Millennium Summit. The Summit\r\nforged agreement on and prioritized a number of\r\nfundamental values seen as essential to international\r\neconomic relations as we journey into the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Those values are also of importance for\r\nfacilitating the integration of the developing countries\r\ninto the globalized world economy. Prime among such\r\nvalues is that of shared responsibility. That is, as\r\nstressed by the Millennium Declaration, responsibility\r\nfor managing worldwide economic and social\r\ndevelopment must be shared among the nations of the\r\nworld and should be exercised multilaterally. One of\r\nthe key objectives identified to translate that shared\r\nvalue into action and to promote the core issues of\r\ndevelopment was the need for good governance both at\r\nthe national and the international levels.\r\nWhile the developing countries recognize their\r\nprimary responsibility for promoting their own\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development, they\r\nare also very much aware that in an era of globalization\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nthey cannot go it alone. They need international\r\nassistance and a conducive external environment\r\nsupportive of development. That must be achieved\r\nthrough genuine dialogue and international cooperation\r\non the basis of mutual interests and benefits, shared\r\nresponsibilities and partnership. That is a winning\r\nrecipe. In addition, Governments recognize that they\r\ncannot deliver without the cooperation of key actors in\r\nthe global economy, such as the private sector and civil\r\nsociety. This, too, is the essence of shared\r\nresponsibility, better global understanding and\r\ninternational economic cooperation.\r\nIn meeting the challenge of globalization and in\r\nseeking to revitalize the spirit of renewal of the\r\ndialogue, we see no better framework than that of the\r\nUnited Nations, an organization whose unique\r\ncharacteristics of universality, neutrality and\r\nmultilateralism are best suited for benefiting and\r\nfacilitating all mankind. We are therefore committed to\r\ncontinue strengthening the Organization’s role for the\r\npromotion of international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment and as humankind’s best hope for\r\nrealizing our universal aspirations for peace,\r\ncooperation and development. The United Nations can\r\ndo that by promoting a broad vision of human\r\ndevelopment, particularly in the primary areas of\r\ngreater policy coordination and by helping to build\r\nhuman and institutional capacity, including the\r\nmobilization of information and communications\r\ntechnologies. By doing so, the integration of the\r\ndeveloping countries into the new global economy and\r\ntheir sharing in both its benefits and responsibilities\r\nshould be facilitated. Only in this way do I see the\r\npossibility of halting and reversing the widening\r\neconomic gap and the digital divide, and thereby\r\npromoting development, eradicating poverty and\r\nincreasing stability for all.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus shares the view\r\nof those who have spoken in this Hall who believe that\r\nthe recent events in New York and Washington are a\r\nuniversal tragedy and a challenge to the international\r\ncommunity of nations. We express our deep\r\ncondolences to the American people and to the loved\r\nones of those who suffered as a result of these terrorist\r\nattacks. Today, when terrorism has become global, we\r\nneed to pool our efforts to eradicate this evil at the\r\nnational and international levels.\r\nIn terms of addressing issues of strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development\r\nbased on partnership, let me express the satisfaction of\r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Belarus that we have\r\nconvened today’s meeting. We view this event as an\r\nimportant additional impetus in considering economic\r\nissues on the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Moreover, in our view, this high-\r\nlevel dialogue should provide considerable input in\r\npreparing the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nMinisterial Conference, to be held in November in\r\nQatar; the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Mexico; and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, to be held in\r\nSouth Africa in 2002.\r\nToday it has already become axiomatic to say that\r\nthe achievement of the development goals that have\r\nbeen agreed in the final documents of major\r\nconferences and high-level meetings within the United\r\nNations is unthinkable without forging a new\r\nconsensus on the foundations and principles of\r\ninternational economic cooperation. An early\r\nestablishment of this kind of consensus is not just an\r\nabstract imperative. It is vital for the more than one\r\nfifth of the Earth’s population who continue to live in\r\nabject poverty, primarily in the developing nations.\r\nAt this juncture, I believe that we can, with a\r\ncertain degree of satisfaction, note that there is a\r\ngradual movement within the international community\r\nin this direction. In this regard, our delegation would\r\nlike to offer a positive assessment of the current status\r\nof the negotiating process in preparing for the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, which has already become a successful\r\nexample of establishing true partnership relationships\r\nbetween the Governments, the United Nations system\r\nand bodies, the Bretton Woods institutions, the private\r\nsector and civil society. The Republic of Belarus hopes\r\nthat this process will continue to maintain its positive\r\ndynamic and will lead to practical results in addressing\r\nthe most urgent issues involving key issues of\r\nmobilizing additional financial resources for\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn this context, as a singular example of the scope\r\nand importance of the issues before us, I would like to\r\nmention the assessment contained in the report of the\r\nCedelio Group, according to which simply meeting the\r\nobligations in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade\r\ntalks could provide the additional benefit to developing\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\ncountries of about US$ 130 billion annually. Clearly,\r\neven partially addressing this issue for developing\r\ncountries could ensure mobilizing an additional US$ 50\r\nbillion per year, which, according to assessments of\r\nthat same Group, is essential for financing\r\ndevelopment goals for 2015. Our delegation hopes that\r\nthe international community will be able to at least\r\nbegin practical discussion of these problems during the\r\nupcoming WTO ministerial conference in Doha. Many\r\nalready pin hopes on this as a “development round”.\r\nIn this context, I would particularly like to note\r\nthat the Republic of Belarus has already undertaken a\r\nnumber of specific steps to meet the interests of\r\ndeveloping countries within the framework of access to\r\nmarkets, and today more than 100 developing nations\r\nenjoy preferential regimes in trade with our country.\r\nExpanding the framework of the use of\r\ninformation and communication technologies has\r\nbecome one of the key factors in effectively achieving\r\ndevelopment goals and in the effective integration of\r\nnations into the global economic system. In this\r\ncontext, the delegation of the Republic of Belarus\r\nwelcomes the establishment of an Information and\r\nCommunication Technologies Task Force, which is\r\nextremely promising in terms of its place within the\r\nUnited Nations system and is an encouraging attempt\r\nto establish a mechanism for practical partnership\r\nbetween Governments, organs of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the private sector. We hope that this Task\r\nForce, acting in strict compliance with the mandate of\r\nthe ministerial declaration of the 2000 high-level\r\nmeeting of the Economic and Social Council is equal to\r\nthe tasks set before it in order to reverse and end the\r\ndangerous process of a widening so-called digital\r\ndivide, the costs of which are particularly felt by the\r\ndeveloping nations.\r\nI believe that no one would doubt that tangible\r\nprogress in this area could bring developing countries\r\ncloser in real terms to achieving their goals in their\r\nsustainable development.\r\nMr. Adam (Israel): At the outset, through you,\r\nSir, my delegation wishes to congratulate the President\r\nof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly on\r\nhis election and to thank the Secretariat for preparing\r\nthis important dialogue.\r\nIsrael is pleased to be participating in this high-\r\nlevel dialogue on strengthening international economic\r\ncooperation for development. As we enter the twenty-\r\nfirst century, we confront a world with tremendous\r\npossibility, but also a world fraught with danger. The\r\nworld has drawn closer in many ways, thanks to the\r\nemergence of global networks for finance and\r\ninformation, as well as the technological innovations\r\nthat have made them possible. But as we also know,\r\nthis world also presents us with new threats and\r\ngrowing challenges.\r\nAt this high-level dialogue we have gathered to\r\naddress one such challenge, that of integrating\r\ndeveloping countries into these global frameworks and\r\nbridging the digital divide. In both respects, Israel\r\npossesses a great deal of know-how and expertise,\r\nwhich it has been sharing with countries around the\r\nworld for more than 40 years.\r\nWhile dealing with its own digital divide, Israel\r\nrecently reached out to share its experience with the\r\nUnited Nations Information and Communication\r\nTechnologies Task Force in the Department of\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs, and is looking forward to\r\nfruitful cooperation in this regard. Israel shares the\r\nview that the Task Force should be provided with\r\nadequate financial resources and commends the work is\r\nhas done so far.\r\nThrough the Centre for International Cooperation,\r\nalso known as MASHAV, Israel has shared the\r\nknowledge and development experience it has acquired\r\nover 53 years of statehood, with over 175,000 trainees\r\nfrom 140 countries around the world.\r\nAs our own development expertise has grown,\r\nand as our partnership with the private sector and civil\r\nsociety in Israel has expanded, the range of courses\r\noffered by MASHAV has also grown, covering areas as\r\ndiverse as irrigation, desert agriculture, water\r\nmanagement, early childhood education, community\r\ndevelopment, emergency and disaster medicine and\r\nmany others. In recent years, Israel has also shared the\r\nexpertise developed in its cutting-edge technology\r\nsector.\r\nIn the wake of the Third United Nations\r\nConference on Least Developed Countries, MASHAV\r\nhas been able to implement a multinational\r\ndevelopment effort focused on improving agricultural\r\npractices and stabilizing the supply of food in Africa.\r\nThe vicious cycle of war and displacement has\r\njeopardized the supply of basic provisions of life in\r\nnumerous regions of the continent. In the last two\r\ndecades, MASHAV has established a number of\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nprojects in Africa designed to demonstrate new\r\ntechnologies for diversifying crop production,\r\nprimarily through the more efficient use of water and\r\nirrigation systems. With the cooperation of the United\r\nNations, these projects can be expanded and thereby\r\nbring subsistence communities out of the precarious\r\nstate in which they are now entrenched.\r\nAlthough the available tools for development\r\nhave expanded over the past 50 years, Israel remains\r\ncommitted to the same principles that have enabled us\r\nto achieve a rapid rate of sustainable development over\r\nmany years. By maintaining our focus on bottom-up\r\nsolutions, human capacity-building and cooperative\r\narrangements with other organizations, Israel will\r\nremain committed to helping other emerging nations\r\ndevelop their resources and successfully integrate\r\nthemselves with the rest of the world.\r\nIn this regard, we congratulate both the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and certain United Nations funds and agencies\r\nfor launching new and innovative programmes, as well\r\nas task forces composed of public and private\r\npartnerships, which are essential for ensuring that\r\nglobalization serves to promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIf ever an event could demonstrate the urgent\r\nneed to alleviate poverty and provide greater economic\r\nopportunity for a greater number of people, it was the\r\ntragedy we all experienced here in New York less than\r\n10 days ago. Once the time for mourning has passed\r\nand the long process of healing begun, the world will\r\nface, amid numerous other challenges, the need to work\r\nfor the alleviation of conditions that drive individuals\r\nto commit extraordinary acts of evil.\r\nI should like to express, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Israel, our most profound\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States of America and to the\r\nfriends and families of the victims of those horrendous\r\nand tragic terrorist acts.\r\nIn this regard, it should be remembered that the\r\nAgenda for Development, as adopted by the General\r\nAssembly, has a broader objective than mere economic\r\nadvancement, important as that is. The Agenda is\r\nmeant to foster greater understanding of emerging\r\nglobal issues and to promote the international\r\ncooperation necessary to address them. While it would\r\nbe a far more gratifying task to direct our energies\r\nexclusively to providing greater economic opportunity\r\nfor all, the challenge of combating terrorism has been\r\nthrust upon us in the most catastrophic way imaginable.\r\nThis is a battle which we no longer have the luxury of\r\navoiding.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French): I\r\nshould like first of all, on behalf of my country, to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Han on his election to preside over the\r\nGeneral Assembly and assure him of the full\r\ncooperation of my delegation. I would also like to\r\ncongratulate the other members of the Bureau, whose\r\nvaluable assistance and steadfast contribution will help\r\nto make our deliberations a success.\r\nAs our meeting is taking place in the shadow of\r\nthe sad events that have plunged into mourning not\r\nonly our host country, but also many other States\r\nMembers of the United Nations, I should like to convey\r\nto them the compassion of the Government of Burkina\r\nFaso.\r\nIt is not merely for reasons of tradition that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has decided to hold another high-\r\nlevel dialogue on the strengthening of international\r\neconomic cooperation for development through\r\npartnership. The holding of this second dialogue has\r\nproved necessary in particular because development is\r\nnow the major concern and preoccupation of States in\r\nan environment that is essentially dominated by\r\nglobalization. This is borne out by the general theme of\r\nthis debate, which focuses on the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the global economy of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nIn this regard, much has been said and a number\r\nof commitments have been undertaken. One after the\r\nother, the multilateral institutions, including the World\r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund and the regional\r\ndevelopment banks, have adopted development policies\r\naimed at promoting the integration of developing\r\ncountries into the world economy. It now remains to\r\naccelerate this process.\r\nWhile the developed countries — in particular the\r\nmembers of the G-8, at their annual summit\r\nmeetings — are placing increasing emphasis on\r\ndevelopment issues, the decisions that they take in this\r\nregard should not remain mere wishful thinking but\r\nshould have clear and quantifiable targets capable of\r\nfreeing the world from poverty.\r\nIn this regard, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, scheduled to take place\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nnext year in Mexico, should provide an opportunity to\r\nconsider the best means of mobilizing the necessary\r\nresources to complement development efforts in the\r\ndisadvantaged countries. Financing for development\r\nwill enable the development partners to reform and\r\nimprove the effectiveness of official development\r\nassistance and create favourable conditions for\r\nincreasing private investment in developing countries.\r\nIn this regard, it is vital for the donors to\r\nundertake to coordinate their efforts; direct their\r\nprogrammes to the poorest countries; de-link\r\nassistance; and harmonize and simplify the procedures\r\nand mechanisms that limit the effectiveness of\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nFor its part, the Government of Burkina Faso is\r\nworking to bring about robust long-term economic\r\ngrowth. To that end, it has set a mean growth-rate\r\ntarget of 7 per cent to 8 per cent per year for 2000-\r\n2004, based essentially on the activities of the private\r\nsector. This will require the establishment of a\r\nfavourable environment for private investment,\r\nparticularly through the pursuit of a policy of\r\nliberalizing the economy and stepping up reforms\r\naimed at creating a safe and stable legal framework for\r\nprivate investment.\r\nAs is well known, new information- and\r\ncommunications-related technology is one of the\r\nfoundations of globalization. This subject cannot be\r\ndiscussed without acknowledging the paradox that the\r\nrate at which the development gap between developed\r\nand developing nations is widening is keeping pace\r\nwith the very technical and technological progress that\r\nis supposed to bring nations and peoples together and\r\ncreate wealth for all.\r\nToday, in the developing countries, and in Africa\r\nin particular, information technology remains a\r\nluxury — indeed, a prestigious commodity reserved for\r\nthe affluent. Our public administration and our private\r\nsector lack the means to acquire the necessary\r\ntechnological tools and to train competent personnel to\r\nmeet the development challenges.\r\nSo how is a country like Burkina Faso, along with\r\nall the other neglected countries, to benefit from the\r\npositive effects of these new technologies and to\r\nreduce the gap between them and the developed\r\ncountries? Part of the answer could come from the new\r\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT)\r\nTask Force, whose creation was recommended by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. We very much hope that\r\nit will allow consideration of new formulas for\r\npartnership in this area that could help solve\r\ndevelopment problems.\r\nIn pursuing its own modest efforts, Burkina Faso\r\nproduced in 1999 a plan for developing a national\r\ninformation and communication infrastructure for the\r\nperiod 2000 to 2004, in order to provide radio and\r\ntelevision coverage of the entire national territory and\r\nestablish an Internet network, which would eventually\r\nserve all the provinces.\r\nPromoting the integration of developing nations\r\ninto the global economy and increasing developing\r\nnations’ involvement in the global information network\r\nare the two key objectives of the international\r\ncommunity in assisting developing countries. I greatly\r\nhope that these meetings will help strengthen the\r\ndialogue among all the development actors and\r\npartners.\r\nIn this regard, the United Nations should use the\r\nimpetus from the Millennium Summit to channel\r\nefforts to promote the integration of developing\r\ncountries into the global economy.\r\nWe must also encourage the good cooperation and\r\ndialogue which have existed for some time between the\r\nUnited Nations institutions and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, for ultimately the efforts of the multilateral\r\norganizations will be successful only if they are\r\nsupported by the political commitment of the member\r\nStates, particularly the donor countries.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the invaluable\r\nassistance of friendly countries to Burkina Faso in its\r\nfight against poverty.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Croatia): At the outset I would\r\nlike to convey on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Croatia our heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the families and friends of all the\r\ninnocent victims who died in last week’s terrorist\r\nattacks. These tragic events serve as a painful reminder\r\nto us all of the imperative need for the international\r\ncommunity to take realistic and comprehensive steps\r\ntowards suppressing and eliminating terrorism of every\r\nkind. My delegation therefore welcomes the timeliness\r\nof the President’s announcement today that priority\r\nwill be given to the General Assembly’s substantial\r\nconsideration of this issue by holding the plenary\r\ndebate as soon as 1 October.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nMy delegation welcomes the high-level dialogue\r\non strengthening international cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership and the opportunity\r\nto address the General Assembly on this important\r\nagenda item concerning ways to facilitate the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy in the face of globalization in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The dynamic nature of the international\r\neconomy continues to impinge upon the living\r\nconditions of people all over the world. The fact that\r\nthe disparity between the rich and the poor is still\r\ngrowing should be a primary cause for international\r\nconcern. With the first anniversary of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration upon us, a Declaration embracing the\r\nhistoric promises made by world leaders, especially in\r\nthe area of development and poverty eradication, it is\r\ntimely for us to revisit and re-examine the notion of a\r\ncomprehensive strategy for sustainable development\r\nthrough international economic integration and\r\npartnership.\r\nMany of us have very specific ideas about the\r\neffects of globalization. The problem is that many of\r\nthese ideas are widely divergent. Despite all the\r\nconnotations that can be read into globalization, with\r\nthe benefit of hindsight, it is clear that globalization is\r\nunavoidable. Indeed, its impact on issues with which\r\nthe United Nations has grappled since its inception —\r\nnamely, poverty and development — has been very\r\nmixed. In our endeavours to manage globalization, we\r\nall agree that the overriding task for us now is to\r\npromote a broader and deeper understanding of the\r\nglobal and transboundary nature of this issue, as well\r\nas to enhance international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment as one of the primary instruments to\r\ntackle its consequences. However, the means to achieve\r\nthis must be reviewed in the context of both current\r\nand evolving challenges. Indeed, these challenges\r\ncould easily be exacerbated by the recent, totally\r\nunpredicted events which we witnessed last week, and\r\nwhich could create new instability in the world\r\neconomy, with serious implications for developing\r\ncountries. The character of the current situation, now\r\nmore than ever, warrants a more detailed and intensive\r\ndebate on the agenda before us.\r\nIn response to globalization, addressing the\r\nquestion of integrating developing countries into the\r\nworld economy has inevitably brought about stronger\r\ninterlinkages between the work of various bodies in the\r\nUnited Nations. Although much has been achieved at\r\nthe United Nations in the last decade in the direction of\r\ncoping with and shaping globalization, deepened\r\ncooperation with other international and regional\r\norganizations needs to be enhanced in a non-\r\nhierarchical way.\r\nGiven the evolving regional perspectives in this\r\ndebate, and given innovative regional mechanisms and\r\nnewly created regional institutions, as well as the\r\nstrengthening of existing ones, we should not overlook\r\nthe vital role those mechanisms and institutions have to\r\nplay. Globalization has contributed to the choice of\r\npolitical priorities of many countries with economies in\r\ntransition, by making accession to the various regional\r\norganizations dealing with economic, trade, security\r\nand political issues a top priority, in the knowledge that\r\nthe contrary would ultimately lead to marginalization.\r\nNeedless to say, the fragility of Western economic\r\nforecasts, highlighted by developments over the last six\r\nmonths, will adversely affect the prospects for\r\neconomic growth in the Central and Eastern European\r\neconomies. Furthermore, from the integration\r\nperspective, a slowdown in Western European markets\r\nposes serious risks for the prospects of European Union\r\nenlargement for the region as a whole.\r\nNotwithstanding this, the institutional capacities\r\nand universal nature of the United Nations ultimately\r\nlend themselves to the United Nations having a pivotal\r\nrole in building the necessary international consensus\r\nfor reforms needed for a strengthened and stable\r\ninternational financial system. In particular, allow me\r\nto highlight the importance my delegation attaches to\r\nhammering out a more prominent role for the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in the field of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and economic cooperation.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia will continue to support\r\nand promote reforms, which encompass dialogue\r\nbetween the Economic and Social Council, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO), and improving their outreach to civil society,\r\nincluding the private sector. This will call for an\r\nenormous effort in order to consolidate further a global\r\nagenda for a strengthened and stable international\r\nfinancial system that is responsive to the priorities of\r\ngrowth and development in an equitable social and\r\neconomic manner.\r\nMoreover, the functional Commissions of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council that deal with economic,\r\nsocial and environmental issues should be important\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nactors in promoting policy coherence and enhancing\r\nthe integration of developing countries in emerging\r\nglobal information networks through the promotion of\r\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT).\r\nThe recent establishment of an ICT Task Force is\r\nwelcome. Through this body, the United Nations has a\r\nunique opportunity to play a catalytic role in the\r\npromotion of public awareness of ICT for\r\ndevelopment, which it should take up without further\r\ndelay.\r\nThrough these joint efforts of global cooperation,\r\nexchange and integration and by creating new\r\nopportunities for partnerships in the fields of trade,\r\ninvestment, finance, knowledge and technology, the\r\nnegative effects of globalization can be curbed and\r\ntransformed into a positive force for all people. At the\r\nsame time, we must not forget that, fundamentally, the\r\nultimate policy choices lie within States, however\r\ndifficult those choices may be.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to the findings of\r\nthe joint panel discussions and roundtables during this\r\nhigh-level dialogue. It is the hope of my delegation that\r\nthe final outcome will provide substantial inputs that\r\nwill not only build on existing achievements to date but\r\nalso yield important practical and action-oriented ideas\r\nthat can be comprehensively utilized in our ongoing\r\nprocess of financing for development and in the work\r\nof the Economic and Social Council in its endeavours\r\nto bridge the digital divide.\r\nMr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme to begin by congratulating the President on being\r\nelected to preside over our discussions, since this is the\r\nfirst time I have spoken at this session, and to say that\r\nyou can count on the cooperation of my delegation to\r\nhelp ensure the success of your tenure.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress the profound sadness of the Government and\r\npeople of my country after the terrorist acts that\r\noccurred in the United States of America this past 11\r\nSeptember. We feel particular solidarity with the\r\nfamilies of the victims and with the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America. We join\r\nother peace- and freedom-loving nations in confronting\r\nthis brutal threat that affects all humanity.\r\nThe Argentinian delegation is participating in this\r\nhigh-level dialogue with particular interest because we\r\nfeel that it provides an excellent opportunity to share\r\nour country’s position on the current challenges that\r\nglobalization presents to our developing world. We\r\nsupport this and other initiatives being taken because\r\nwe hope that the United Nations can play a decisive\r\nrole in economic and social areas in the coming years\r\nby helping developing countries integrate into the\r\nworld economy and by enabling them to overcome the\r\ncurrent conditions of delayed development and poverty\r\nand to further their economic and human development.\r\nMy country has been endeavouring to achieve\r\nsustained economic growth and to overcome the period\r\nof recession that began in our country three years ago.\r\nThis period has been the result of various domestic and\r\ninternational factors, including, of course, the impact\r\nof the successive international financial crises that\r\naffected several national economies during the decade\r\nof the 90s.\r\nWe are fully aware that the main responsibility\r\nfor our development falls to us alone and to our ability\r\nto create the conditions of political stability, the rule of\r\nlaw and sufficiently responsible and sober management\r\nof public finances, which would limit unproductive\r\ngovernment spending, particularly in the civil service,\r\nfight administrative corruption and further the\r\ncampaign against tax evasion. These policies have been\r\ncarried out consistently in Argentina in recent years,\r\nculminating in the recent measure of a zero deficit law,\r\nwhich prevents the State from further borrowing or\r\nfrom spending more than its revenues in order to\r\neliminate any doubt about the sustainability of our\r\nfiscal policies with respect to the markets.\r\nAs is obvious, the implementation of this policy\r\nrequires an extraordinary effort from the Argentinean\r\npublic. However, we are thoroughly convinced that this\r\nis the necessary foundation for returning to the road to\r\ngrowth and creating a climate conducive to attracting\r\ninvestment.\r\nIt is obvious, however, that, within the framework\r\nof globalization we are experiencing, national efforts\r\nare not enough if countries face difficulties in trade,\r\nwhich is a vital component for the global integration of\r\ndeveloping countries and which naturally plays a\r\ndecisive role in those countries’ development.\r\nThe persistence of barriers to the access to the\r\nmarkets of developed countries, in the form of the\r\ntariffs, quotas and subsidies for domestic production\r\nand exports that exist in those countries, have\r\nsystematically frustrated the trade opportunities of the\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\ndeveloping world and aggravated the economic\r\ndifficulties affecting the lives of the population.\r\nAs was recently stated by the leaders of the\r\nCairns Group, an association of countries with the\r\nprincipal goal of reducing agricultural protectionism,\r\nthe total assistance to producers in the most developed\r\ncountries has increased, and we find ourselves in a\r\nsituation similar to that of 1986, as some markets\r\ncontinue to be highly protected. These distortions in\r\ntrade and in production are clearly discriminatory since\r\nthey create asymmetrical trade rules that especially\r\nhurt countries that cannot compete with the national\r\ntreasuries of the rich countries.\r\nThe liberalization of international markets for the\r\ncompetitive products of the developing countries and,\r\nin my country’s case, the liberalization of agricultural\r\nmarkets are not merely an issue of a purely trade\r\ncharacter, but a central part of our overall development\r\nstrategy.\r\nIn the discussions that will take place in the\r\nFourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization at Doha, Qatar, next November this\r\nproblem should not be neglected, and we will focus our\r\naction there on the convening of a multilateral round\r\nthat will necessarily include examination of the\r\nagricultural issue, with a specific agenda. That will be\r\nour condition for accepting the initiation of a new\r\nround of trade negotiations within the framework of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization.\r\nThe United Nations has rapidly reacted to these\r\nchallenges in the economic and social domains. Proof\r\nof this is the convening of an international conference\r\non financing for development, to be held next March in\r\nMonterey, Mexico. Both the work of the Preparatory\r\nCommittee and the excellent report by the high-level\r\ngroup headed by the former President of Mexico,\r\nMr. Ernesto Zedillo, have taken note of this problem in\r\ntrade. They also take note of the need that the new\r\nround of trade negotiations be a “round in favour of\r\ndevelopment”, for the benefit of developing countries\r\nand in the interest of the most developed countries. As\r\nthat report affirms, “In the global village, someone\r\nelse’s poverty very soon becomes one’s own problem:\r\nof lack of markets for one’s products, illegal\r\nimmigration, pollution, contagious disease and\r\ninsecurity ...”\r\nOur country has been working to expand its\r\nmarkets and, as has occurred in other regions,\r\nArgentina first concentrated its efforts on its relations\r\nwith neighbouring countries, to which we are tied by\r\nshared history and affinities that go beyond the area of\r\ntrade. Through Mercosur, expanded to include Bolivia\r\nand Chile, we continue our task of creating an\r\nintegrated regional bloc, designed as an open type of\r\nregionalism and ready to promote the area’s trade and\r\neconomic integration with other regions. Mercosur\r\nhopes to move towards an integration of the entire\r\nhemisphere in the coming years, within the framework\r\nof a free trade zone in all the Americas, which should\r\nbe completed by 2005. We have recently also initiated\r\nthe so-called “four + one” negotiations among the\r\nCommon Market of the South (Mercosur) and the\r\nUnited States with the same purpose of expanding trade\r\nliberalization and the openness of our respective\r\nmarkets.\r\nIt is along those lines that we view our integration\r\ninto the world economy in the twenty-first century. But\r\neven if we are able to achieve significant advances in\r\ndomestic policy reform, in the liberalization of trade\r\nand in direct investment flows to developing countries,\r\ninternational cooperation for development will\r\ncontinue to be essential for countries that do not have\r\nsufficient flows of private investment or that must cope\r\nwith humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters\r\nrequiring urgent attention. The role played by loans\r\nfrom multilateral banks and official development\r\nassistance is essential to those countries.\r\nWe also wish to express the hope that we will\r\nattain the goal of having official development\r\nassistance reach 0.7 per cent of industrialized\r\ncountries’ gross domestic product. We trust that the\r\nMonterrey conference will make it possible to hold an\r\nextensive debate on these issues vital to development\r\nand the eradication of poverty.\r\nFinally, we would like to express our keen\r\ninterest in the full participation of developing countries\r\nin the extraordinary benefits of the revolution in\r\ninformation and communications technologies. We\r\nneed not go into detail about the impact that that\r\nprocess has on economic growth and the promotion of\r\ntrade and in increasing investment. Nevertheless, there\r\nis a great risk that the so-called digital divide will\r\nfurther marginalize the developing world away from\r\nbeing able to take advantage of this new opportunity.\r\nWe hope that, once the current difficulties are\r\novercome, the Secretary-General will be able to\r\n30\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nannounce the launching of a public-private task force\r\nthat will, while working in close coordination with\r\nexisting initiatives such as the one being promoted by\r\nthe Group of 8, guide the efforts that will make\r\nuniversal access to information and communications\r\ntechnologies a reality. Our country, which is carrying\r\nout projects at the national level to expand and promote\r\nthe use of the Internet in the area of education, would\r\nlike to participate in that task force in order to\r\ncontribute and exchange experiences.\r\nFinally, I wish to express my appreciation for the\r\nopportunity given to us to discuss effectively the ways\r\nto respond adequately to the current challenges of\r\nglobalization. We place our hopes in the decisive role\r\nto be played by the United Nations in that process.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): As\r\nthis is the first time that I take the floor during this\r\nsession, I would like to say that Egypt condemns the\r\ncriminal terrorist acts that took place in Washington,\r\nNew York and Pennsylvania. We express the deepest\r\ncondolences of the people and Government of Egypt to\r\nthe American people and the American Government.\r\nIn a world of increased globalization and\r\ninterdependence, partnerships constitute an essential\r\nmechanism for promoting development. They are not a\r\nluxury or a choice that countries may or may not\r\nconsider. This is particularly true with regard to the\r\nprocess of integrating developing countries into the\r\ninternational economic order in a healthy and orderly\r\nmanner. However, in order for these partnerships to\r\nproduce their intended results all resources and efforts\r\nneed to be mobilized to create a set of national and\r\ninternational conditions that are crucial for the\r\nsuccessful implementation of such partnerships.\r\nLooking at the issue from a wider perspective,\r\npartnerships entail the collaboration and coordination\r\nof all efforts at the national and international levels. In\r\nour view, partnerships include many actors at the\r\nnational level, namely, the State and its national\r\ninstitutions, the private sector and civil society. On the\r\ninternational level partnerships include donor\r\ncountries, multilateral economic institutions, and\r\ninternational civil society, in addition to the\r\ninternational private sector, particularly large\r\ntransnational corporations.\r\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the primary\r\nresponsibility for formulating development strategies\r\nand policies in developing countries is a national one.\r\nIn this regard, the challenges and potential\r\nopportunities provided by globalization dictate the\r\nneed for forging partnerships on the national level.\r\nThis is achieved through improved governance\r\nstructures, capacity-building and raising the standards\r\nand modes of operation of domestic institutions, in\r\naddition to increasing and improving coordination\r\nbetween various national actors in the area of\r\ndevelopment. That also requires popular participation\r\nthrough activation of the principles of democracy,\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. In many cases, the\r\nachievement of these standards and goals requires\r\nimmense human and material resources that are beyond\r\navailable national means.\r\nIn that regard, partnerships between Governments\r\nand the private sector play a vital role in closing the\r\nexisting financial gap and in releasing the immense\r\nenergy and creativity of the private sector in promoting\r\nthe development process. Civil society also plays a\r\ncrucial role in this regard by mobilizing additional\r\nresources and distributing the fruits of development in\r\na more equitable manner, in addition to the strong\r\nsupervisory role it plays in preserving the gains from\r\ndevelopment, and by expanding the margin of popular\r\nparticipation in strengthening development efforts.\r\nIt is not possible for any national effort to achieve\r\neconomic growth and development within the context\r\nof a real constructive spirit of national partnership\r\nwithout the existence of an enabling healthy\r\nenvironment at the international level that promotes\r\ndevelopment. An international environment that\r\nassigns due priority to correcting existing imbalances\r\nwithin the international economic system is crucial.\r\nThese imbalances could be, inter alia, the result of the\r\nnegative impact of policy decisions by large developed\r\neconomies on smaller and weaker ones, or the result of\r\nthe lagging institutional development of multilateral\r\neconomic institutions that have not been able to adjust\r\nto international economic and political developments\r\nwith appropriate speed. Hence, there is a need to\r\naddress such imbalances to make policy decisions more\r\nresponsive to the development circumstances of\r\ndeveloping countries, and to take into account the\r\ninterests of all members of the international\r\ncommunity, and not only the narrow interests of a few\r\nnumber of countries or a minority of large economic\r\nentities.\r\nIn the light of all this, we see an urgent need for\r\nthe United Nations and the international community to\r\n31\r\nA/56/PV.5\r\nend once and for all the impotent dialogue that\r\nattempts to distort the evolution of a comprehensive\r\ninternational vision for development. This dialogue\r\nattempts to concentrate only on the national or\r\ninternational dimensions and efforts to deal with the\r\ndilemma of economic development in this age of rapid\r\nglobalization. As we recognize the primary national\r\nresponsibility of countries to formulate their\r\ndevelopment strategies and policies, we also do not\r\naccept the distorted view that reduces the international\r\ndimension to a superficial supportive role in\r\nstrengthening development efforts.\r\nTrue partnerships require sincere and constructive\r\nengagement to correct imbalances at the national and\r\ninternational levels. It also means that the international\r\ncommunity should overcome existing views with\r\nregard to the roles assigned to the donor countries, the\r\ninternational private sector and multilateral economic\r\ninstitutions, and should start formulating a more\r\npositive and engaging role that is more responsive to\r\nthe development needs and circumstances of\r\ndeveloping countries. These revised roles should be\r\nhonest in recognizing both the responsibilities and\r\nduties of all parties at both the national and\r\ninternational levels, within a true spirit of partnership\r\nthat takes into consideration the right of all peoples of\r\nthe world to develop and prosper.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\n"
