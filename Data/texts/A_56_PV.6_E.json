(Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 97 (continued)\r\nSustainable development and international economic\r\ncooperation\r\n(c) High-level dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): Allow me at the\r\noutset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly. I am confident\r\nthat, under your most able leadership, this session of\r\nthe General Assembly will successfully achieve its\r\nobjectives. My congratulations also go to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Harry Holkeri, for his dedicated and\r\nskilful leadership.\r\nMy delegation wishes to associate itself with the\r\nstatement delivered yesterday by the Chairman of the\r\nGroup of 77. The current process of globalization and\r\ntechnological advancement remains highly selective\r\nand excludes the vast majority of the global population\r\nfrom its prospective benefits. A situation in which the\r\nincome of the top 20 per cent of the global population\r\nis nearly 80 times greater than that of the 20 per cent at\r\nthe bottom is not only morally difficult to accept, but\r\nalso impossible to sustain. Further marginalization of\r\nthe most weak and vulnerable is becoming a global\r\nchallenge. Representatives who spoke yesterday\r\ntouched upon the manifold responses that ought to be\r\ntaken to address this global challenge. I would like to\r\nconfine my brief remarks to the two sub-themes of our\r\ndiscussion.\r\nWith regard to the sub-theme 1, Promotion of the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy and generating new public and private\r\nresources to complement development efforts, many\r\ndelegations yesterday justly emphasized the importance\r\nof the efforts by developing countries themselves. It\r\nmust be pointed out, however, that international\r\neconomic cooperation in trade, finance and technology\r\ncould and in fact should create adequate conditions for\r\nenabling the developing countries to reap the benefits\r\nof globalization.\r\nInternational trade plays an important role in the\r\neconomic and social advancement of developing\r\ncountries. Therefore, the elimination of physical and\r\nnon-physical trade barriers would be a major step\r\ntowards addressing the challenges faced by the\r\ndeveloping countries. The current multilateral trade\r\nagreements require tariffs to be assessed on an equal\r\nmost-favoured-nation basis. In these circumstances\r\nadequate measures should be taken to level the uneven\r\nplaying field between industrialized and developing\r\ncountries, taking duly into account the needs of the\r\nmost vulnerable among them, particularly the least\r\ndeveloped, landlocked and small island developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe current trade regime overlooks the very\r\nimportant fact that greatly varying international\r\ntransport costs create extreme vulnerabilities for\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nlandlocked developing countries. These countries are\r\npaying three times as much as industrialized States and\r\ntwice as much as fellow developing countries to\r\ntransport their export items to the world markets.\r\nTherefore, it is difficult, or even impossible, to talk\r\nabout benefits of international trade and globalization\r\nfor this particular group of countries. Most landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries depend heavily on a few export-\r\nbased sectors for their economic and social growth.\r\nTherefore, my delegation believes that the special\r\ncircumstances and needs of these countries should be\r\nadequately addressed at multilateral trade forums,\r\nparticularly at the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nMinisterial Meeting in Doha, and at the new round of\r\ntrade negotiations, if and when they commence.\r\nThe issue of the technological marginalization of\r\nmost of the developing world is being justly raised\r\nduring this discussion of ours. We believe that this\r\nproblem, like many other problems, cannot be\r\nadequately addressed when one third of the world’s\r\npopulation has to survive on the equivalent of $1 per\r\nday. Adequate sources of financing are needed. Under\r\nthese circumstances, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development should address all aspects of\r\ndevelopment and development financing, especially for\r\nthe most vulnerable and weakest developing countries.\r\nThe ability to benefit from globalization depends\r\nnot only on the improved capacity to benefit from\r\ninternational trade, but also on the ability to make use\r\nof complex information and communication technology\r\n(ICT). ICT is becoming an essential tool for economic\r\ndevelopment in our age; it underlies power, knowledge\r\nand creativity. As developing countries, especially the\r\nmost vulnerable among them, become ever more\r\nmarginalized from globalization and are being left\r\nbehind the advances of information technology, their\r\ndevelopmental opportunities vanish and they face\r\nfurther marginalization with all the ensuing\r\nconsequences. Therefore, it is vital that the United\r\nNations make its own contribution to addressing this\r\ngrowing challenge.\r\nMy delegation therefore welcomes the\r\nestablishment of the ICT Task Force as a significant\r\nfirst step towards bridging the digital divide. A major\r\ntask now is to commence the activities of the Task\r\nForce, as was rightly pointed out by the Chairman of\r\nthe Group of 77 yesterday in his statement.\r\nMy delegation believes that, perhaps, a special\r\nbrainstorming meeting on ICT for development might\r\nbe useful. Such a meeting could provide a major\r\nimpetus to the commencement of the activities of the\r\nTask Force and could bring together Governments,\r\nmultilateral institutions, the donor community, the\r\nprivate sector and civil society. It could discuss\r\nconcrete ways and means of assisting developing\r\ncountries to acquire the technological infrastructure of\r\nthe new economy and the capacity to utilize it\r\neffectively. It could also focus on such priority issues\r\nas improving the quality of education in developing\r\ncountries so as to enable them to utilize to the fullest\r\nextent the technology, developing informational\r\ninfrastructure and broadly introducing ICT to the vast\r\nrural population in developing countries. It is evident\r\nthat rural people will remain on the margins of\r\ndevelopment if their specific informational needs and\r\nremoteness from the centres of progress of\r\ntechnological development are not addressed.\r\nDiscriminatory globalization is fraught with the\r\npossibility of creating a world that is made up, on the\r\none hand, of a highly connected, and thus productive,\r\nextremely affluent minority and, on the other, a vast\r\nmajority that is excluded not only from its benefits but\r\nalso from contributing in turn to technological\r\nadvancement and globalization. The international\r\ncommunity, through its sustained and cooperative\r\nefforts, should prevent and reverse the process of\r\nfurther marginalization of the weakest and most\r\nvulnerable. My delegation expresses the hope that this\r\nhigh-level dialogue on strengthening international\r\neconomic cooperation for development through\r\npartnership will be able to contribute to these efforts.\r\nMr. Ahsan (Bangladesh): Since I am taking the\r\nfloor for the first time since your assumption, Sir, of\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, allow me to congratulate you on behalf of\r\nthe Government of the People’s Republic of\r\nBangladesh. We are confident that under your able\r\nguidance we will be able to reach fruitful conclusions\r\nin our work during this session.\r\nI speak today with a heavy heart as I recall the\r\nmassive loss of innocent human lives and destruction\r\nof property in the United States of America caused by\r\nthe dastardly acts of terrorists. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Bangladesh, I reiterate\r\nour total condemnation of this mindless violence and\r\nexpress our solidarity with the Government and the\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\npeople of the United States at this hour. We offer our\r\ndeep condolences for the victims and sympathy to the\r\nbereaved families. Bangladesh reiterates its support for\r\nany international effort to combat terrorism in all its\r\nmanifestations.\r\nI deem it an honour and privilege to be able to\r\nspeak on this important occasion. I take this\r\nopportunity to commend the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in organizing this second high-level dialogue\r\nunder the general theme of strengthening international\r\neconomic cooperation for development through\r\npartnership. The basis and rationale for holding such a\r\ndialogue, for reiterating our commitment to achieving\r\nthe common goal of economic development, is\r\nreflected in General Assembly resolution 55/193. That\r\nresolution identified the need to provide a platform for\r\nthe exchange of ideas at a high level in order to give\r\nimpetus to the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nWe commend the statement delivered yesterday\r\nby the Chairman of the Group of 77 and subscribe to\r\nthe views expressed on behalf of the Group. I intend to\r\naddress a couple of issues that we consider to be\r\nimportant.\r\nThe world is changing at an unthinkable pace due\r\nto the forces of globalization. The process throws up\r\nopportunities as well as challenges. Globalization has\r\nalso transformed the social and economic\r\nconsiderations of countries around the world. Given its\r\npervasive effects, we have to ensure that the process of\r\nglobalization does not undermine social justice and that\r\nit works better, in the interests of everyone. That is\r\nwhy we need to make it broad-based and participatory.\r\nAs the twin forces of globalization and trade\r\nliberalization proceed, the developing countries in\r\ngeneral, and the least developed countries in particular,\r\nfind themselves increasingly marginalized. That is\r\nevident in their gradually declining share in world\r\ntrade, investment and output. In today’s globalized\r\nworld, the rationale for international cooperation is\r\nobvious, because those countries need a supportive\r\nexternal environment for the success of their economic\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nIn recognition of that imperative, and to reap the\r\nbenefits of globalization, a series of major United\r\nNations conferences were held in the area of\r\nsustainable development, with the adoption of a\r\nnumber of programmes of action. Over the past few\r\nyears, their implementation has been followed up\r\nthrough their respective review and appraisal\r\nconferences. Despite the best intentions of the\r\ninternational community, the developing countries,\r\nparticularly the least developed countries, have not\r\nbeen able to progress very far. Poverty remains\r\npervasive; opportunities remain meagre for the poor;\r\nand a vast sector of women continue to be\r\ndisadvantaged. We want full and faithful\r\nimplementation of the programmes of action adopted at\r\nthose conferences. We believe there is need for an\r\neffective mechanism for the implementation of these\r\nprogrammes of action, a mechanism pioneered by the\r\nUnited Nations for coordinated follow-up at the global\r\nand regional levels.\r\nMore than other developing countries, the least\r\ndeveloped countries have had to face the challenges of\r\nglobalization from a very weak socio-economic base.\r\nThe Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, held in May this year, provided\r\nan opportunity to deal comprehensively with the\r\nproblems and prospects of least developed countries\r\nafter more than a decade. The Programme of Action for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-\r\n2010 and the accompanying Brussels Declaration, and\r\nin particular the seven commitments, cover a wide\r\nrange of issues for follow-up at the national,\r\nsubregional, regional and global levels.\r\nInternational cooperation presupposes the sharing\r\nof resources and expertise in order to face the\r\nchallenges of globalization. Apart from individual\r\ncountries, regional organizations and international\r\nbodies have a vital role in operationalizing that\r\ncooperation. The idea of partnership was clearly\r\nreflected in the outcome of the Third Conference.\r\nAnother area requiring such cooperation was\r\nevident in the aftermath of the recent financial crises:\r\nimproving the coherence of the international financial\r\nsystem through participatory management and greater\r\ntransparency, thus ensuring increased participation of\r\ndeveloping countries. The much-needed reform should\r\nencompass a mechanism for the management of\r\nfinancial crises and should provide early warning of\r\nimpending crises.\r\nWe welcome the holding of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held\r\nin March next year in Mexico. We consider that this\r\nwill be a milestone event in international development\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\ncooperation following the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries. We\r\nbelieve that the event will provide an opportunity to\r\naddress related national, international and systemic\r\nissues, including mobilization of domestic resources,\r\ndebt relief and trade benefits for developing countries.\r\nWe are hopeful that it will be possible to reach\r\nagreement on concrete guidelines and measures for the\r\nmobilization of resources from the domestic sector,\r\nespecially through effective public finance policy, and\r\nin the external sector as well, through increased trade,\r\nofficial development assistance, flows of foreign direct\r\ninvestment and transfer of technology.\r\nWe attach great importance to the issue of\r\nprotectionism in trade measures, in particular in the\r\nagriculture sector of developed countries, because of its\r\nadverse impact on developing economies. This has\r\nprevented developing countries from benefiting fully\r\nfrom trade. We believe that the fourth World Trade\r\nOrganization Ministerial Conference, to be held in\r\nQatar in November, will present yet another\r\nopportunity to rectify current imbalances in the\r\nmultilateral trading system. In that connection, I wish\r\nto flag some of the specific areas where well-designed\r\npolicies and rules may be helpful for greater integration\r\nof the developing countries into the global economy.\r\nThese include, first, market initiatives in favour of\r\ndeveloping countries, including greater access for their\r\ngoods; secondly, easier movement of labour; thirdly,\r\nprogressive removal of all trade barriers and\r\nrestrictions; fourthly, increased foreign capital flows in\r\nterms of both official development assistance and\r\nforeign direct investment; fifthly, effective measures to\r\nreduce the debt burden; and finally, increased flow of\r\ntechnical skills and knowledge.\r\nThe tremendous advancement of the information\r\nand communications technology sector offers a great\r\nopportunity for rapid dissemination of information and\r\ntechnical know-how. We are fully appreciative of the\r\nvital role it has to play in the global economy of the\r\ntwenty-first century. In that context, we welcome the\r\nrecommendations adopted at the Group of 8 summit in\r\nOkinawa with respect to reaping the full benefits of the\r\ndigital revolution and to helping developing countries\r\nbridge the digital divide. It is heartening to know that\r\nthe recently formed Digital Opportunity Task Force is\r\nfully functional.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing the hope\r\nthat this high-level event will be able to make a\r\npositive contribution to our efforts to achieve the goal\r\nof economic development, by making concrete\r\nrecommendations. In our endeavours, special focus\r\nmust be maintained on the acute economic problems\r\nfaced by the least developed countries. More should be\r\ndone to help them combat the negative effects of\r\nglobalization and to integrate them into the global\r\neconomy.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): This\r\nsecond high-level dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development\r\nthrough partnership, which is addressing issues of far-\r\nreaching significance for developing countries, is for\r\nobvious reasons taking place under extremely trying\r\nand tragic circumstances. Given those circumstances,\r\nthis dialogue is doubly important. First of all, it is\r\nfocusing on its substantive agenda: the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the world economy and into\r\nthe global information network. And secondly, this\r\ndialogue is important because it symbolizes the firm\r\ndetermination of the international community, and of\r\nthe United Nations in particular, to move forward with\r\nits essential task. The terrible events with which we are\r\nall familiar must not divert us from our goal.\r\nThose points made, I cannot continue without\r\nfirst, on behalf of the people and Government of the\r\nRepublic of Paraguay, reiterating our deepest feelings\r\nof condolence and solidarity to the people and\r\nGovernment of the United States of America, and in\r\nparticular to the families of the victims of the recent\r\ntragedy. Undoubtedly, the international community\r\nmust exhaust all possible efforts in order to carry out a\r\njoint action to eradicate this evil, which is terrorism.\r\nWe must collectively acknowledge that\r\nglobalization is an undeniable reality that is\r\nintensifying daily and becoming increasingly evident in\r\nits various manifestations. The real point of discussion\r\nis how to channel this process and direct it in a way\r\nthat may yield benefits for all of mankind equitably,\r\nwhile not allowing it to serve the interests of a few, nor\r\nallowing it to widen the already existing gap between\r\nthe rich and the poor. We must approach globalization\r\nfrom a positive perspective because it makes available\r\nto us great progress in technology, communication,\r\ntransportation and trade, to mention just some of\r\naspects. However, the benefits of this phenomenon\r\nmust be shared by all in a spirit of solidarity and social\r\njustice.\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nThis is why consideration of the particular items\r\non our agenda must be a shared endeavour based on\r\ncooperation and partnership. Integrating the developing\r\ncountries into the global economy and seeking new\r\nsources of financing will prove successful only through\r\na collective effort that includes all the major actors —\r\nthe United Nations institutions, the World Trade\r\nOrganization, the Bretton Woods institutions, the\r\nprivate sector and civil society — while at the same\r\ntime ensuring the participation of countries with\r\nvarying levels of development.\r\nIn this context, we emphasize the importance of\r\nthe process of financing for development, which will\r\nculminate with the holding of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development next year in\r\nMonterrey, Mexico. We must, with our fullest effort,\r\ntake advantage of this opportunity to examine the\r\nproblems involving development resources, and not\r\nallow that to become an additional burden to the\r\nexternal debt of developing countries.\r\nWe can also emphasize the discussions on\r\nfinancing for development being carried out under the\r\nauspices of the Bretton Woods institutions, which are\r\nessential players in the process of integrating the\r\ndeveloping world, as well as the fourth World Trade\r\nOrganization Ministerial Conference to be held in\r\nDoha, Qatar in November 2001.\r\nIn this context, bearing in mind the essential role\r\nof trade in development in our countries, we\r\nunderscore the importance of continuing the trade\r\nliberalization process, particularly with regard to\r\nagricultural products, so as to offset existing\r\ndisadvantages in the current trade regime, in order to\r\ncreate a just, transparent and predictable system,\r\nparticularly through the complete elimination of all\r\ntrade barriers, tariff and non-tariff barriers, that most\r\nhurt our countries.\r\nDeveloping countries must have just access to\r\nmarkets, so that they can participate on an equal\r\nfooting in the multilateral trade system. In this regard,\r\nwe must acknowledge that certain developing countries\r\nhave major disadvantages and situations that further\r\nimpede their development because of specific factors\r\nand that any cooperation arrangement must take this\r\nreality into account. The landlocked developing\r\ncountries, the least developed countries and the small-\r\nisland-developing countries all face a greater risk of\r\nbeing marginalized and of not gaining the access to the\r\nglobalization benefits that the other developing\r\ncountries have. It would be a mistake to lump all\r\ndeveloping countries into one group without\r\nrecognizing that there are clear-cut differences in their\r\nrespective situations and levels of development, as well\r\nas real capabilities for joining international processes.\r\nInformation and communication technology is\r\nboth a cause and a component of globalization. Fairly\r\nand equitably oriented, it can be an important\r\ninstrument for our countries, promoting human-\r\nresource training, strengthening both legal and\r\nfinancial institutional frameworks and facilitating\r\ntrade, among other things. Having technology means\r\nhaving an advantage and development. That is why the\r\ndeveloped countries have the obligation and the moral\r\nresponsibility to ensure that new technologies be\r\nwithin the reach of all, in order to avoid exacerbating\r\nthe inherent disadvantages of many developing\r\ncountries. Technology can offset the obvious inequities\r\nonly through the participation and the cooperation of\r\nall, in a spirit of human solidarity. We welcome the\r\ncreation of the Information and Communication\r\nTechnologies Task Force, and we underscore the need\r\nfor it to receive the resources necessary to carry out its\r\nimportant work. We also highlight the work of the\r\nCommission on Science and Technology for\r\nDevelopment.\r\nFinally, we reiterate the importance of being ever\r\nmindful of the most disadvantaged developing\r\ncountries, considering that technology is an essential\r\ntool for their future development, which will offer all\r\nthe tools necessary for us to achieve social justice in\r\nour respective countries.\r\nMr. Al-Haddad (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Yemen, it is\r\na pleasure for me to congratulate the President on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-sixth session of\r\nthe General Assembly and on the work of the high-\r\nlevel dialogue on strengthening international economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership.\r\nWe also wish to take this opportunity through\r\nyou, Sir, to express our gratitude and appreciation to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Holkeri, for his constructive\r\nefforts throughout the last session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAllow us at the outset to express our most sincere\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims of the\r\nterrorist operation, of which the United States, New\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nYork, Washington and Pennsylvania have been the\r\nvictims. It was a shock for us, as well as for the entire\r\ninternational community. In view of the seriousness of\r\nwhat occurred, we wish to repeat once again that\r\nterrorism in all its forms is action condemned by all\r\nreligions. We wish to express firm condemnation of\r\nterrorism at this important session of the General\r\nAssembly and stress the need for establishing an\r\ninternational coalition to end terrorism.\r\nThis second stage of the important dialogue on\r\nthe strengthening of international economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership is\r\ndevoted to the issue of globalization and to facilitating\r\nthe integration of developing countries into the\r\ninternational economy of the twenty-first century. We\r\nare following up a dialogue that began earlier this year\r\nand taking part in round-table meetings. Further\r\nimpetus should be given to this process so as to ensure\r\nthat important conclusions and decisions are taken at a\r\nglobal level as a result of this important dialogue.\r\nGlobalization, which is a characteristic of the\r\nmodern era, is having an enormous impact on rapid and\r\ndiversified progress, especially in the area of trade,\r\ntechnology and growth. The objectives of\r\nglobalization, however, have been confined to the\r\nmarket, and social and human interests have tended to\r\nbe ignored. The main actors in this process are\r\noperating within the major multinational companies\r\nand some developed countries, and this has created\r\nobstacles for the countries of the third world, which are\r\nsuffering under the burden of foreign debt and deep\r\nfinancial crises. Indeed, it has worsened the situation\r\nfor those countries, creating impediments and further\r\nmarginalizing them.\r\nIn this context, international action should be\r\ntaken, in a spirit of solidarity and shared responsibility,\r\nto deal with the crises in the developing countries and\r\nfacilitate their integration into the world economy in an\r\nequitable and just manner. To this end, several steps\r\nneed to be taken. The economic bases of the\r\ndeveloping countries need to be strengthened to enable\r\nthem to overcome their economic problems;\r\ninfrastructure and human resource capacity must be\r\nenhanced; the problem of low prices for exports from\r\ndeveloping countries must be addressed; and relations\r\nbetween developed and developing countries —\r\nincluding on the issue of the debt — must be improved.\r\nFurthermore, access to the international market for the\r\nagricultural and industrialized products of developing\r\ncountries should be facilitated; this is vital.\r\nThere are other important aspects contributing to\r\nthe weakness of the economies of developing countries\r\nthat need to be addressed, including their lack of\r\nnegotiating strength, given the current context of\r\ninternational relationships. We believe that this is a\r\nvery important consideration. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration, made by heads of State or Government,\r\nemphasized the need to adopt a new methodology\r\nwithin international relations based on the justice,\r\nequity and common interests.\r\nThe developing countries are heavily indebted,\r\nand greatly depend upon international development\r\nactivity, external bilateral assistance and multilateral\r\naid. Short-term direct investment in the development\r\nprocess strips developing countries of their negotiating\r\npower and does not allow them to qualify for\r\nintegration in the global economy as an equal partner.\r\nIndeed, it leads to further marginalization.\r\nMany developing countries, including the\r\nRepublic of Yemen, have taken appropriate measures\r\nfor the required adjustments, such as free markets and\r\neconomic reforms that would push their economies\r\nforward and help them to integrate into the global\r\neconomy. However, these measures, which are being\r\ntaken in cooperation with international financial and\r\ntrade institutions, have not yet led to integration into\r\nthe global economy.\r\nWhat we are witnessing now is that free trade and\r\nthe removal of trade barriers have allowed world trade\r\nto break down the foundations of national economies.\r\nThe expansion of world trade, which has led to\r\nincreased production and growth of capital and short-\r\nterm investment, was accompanied by harmful effects\r\non domestic products in developing countries, due to\r\ntheir inability to compete with quality products.\r\nFurthermore, the capabilities of developing countries in\r\nthe field of technology and information and in the\r\ninterlinkage of production, distribution and marketing\r\ncannot be compared to those of the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThis should lead us to work to resolve the\r\nproblem of international trade relations at a multilateral\r\nlevel. I am referring here to the World Trade\r\nOrganization and the General Agreement on Tariffs and\r\nTrade, and to particular issues such as intellectual\r\nproperty, services and the criteria for economic and\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nagricultural investment and so forth. The interests of\r\nthe developing countries must be considered in dealing\r\nwith all these issues; developing countries should be\r\nrecognized as true partners and allowed to assume\r\ninternational economic responsibility.\r\nAny attempt to integrate the developing countries\r\ninto the world economy and the globalized world,\r\nbased on partnership, must consider such countries as\r\nparticipants in the international decision-making\r\nprocess. This process, which has been globalized, tends\r\nto ignore the interests of the developing countries,\r\nbecause economic, social and even cultural decisions\r\nare made at the national level, while the objective of\r\nglobalization is pursued through the vision of\r\ninternational financial organizations, which finance\r\nactivities on a large scale. Thus, national Governments\r\nare pressured into relinquishing their national\r\nsovereignty in the management of national\r\ndevelopment policies and required to adapt to new\r\nconcepts and trends that come from the outside.\r\nWe have great hopes that the high-level dialogue,\r\nand the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be convened next year, will enable us\r\nto achieve global world economic prosperity and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Galuška (Czech Republic): As this is the\r\nfirst time I have taken the floor at this session as the\r\nrepresentative of my country, I should like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on behalf of my Government, on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-sixth session, and to pledge our\r\nfull support to you in your important and demanding\r\nwork.\r\nThe Czech Republic has aligned itself with the\r\nEuropean Union (EU) statement on the topic under\r\ndiscussion. We unequivocally share the views on all\r\nissues expressed in the EU statement made by the\r\nBelgian presidency yesterday. The Czech delegation\r\nwould now like to further elaborate on three points that\r\nin our view are crucial: the development dimension of\r\ninternational economic cooperation; countries’\r\nresponsibility for their development; and regional\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe issue of international economic cooperation\r\nfor development has been a major concern of the\r\ninternational community over the decades. But the\r\nmost recent events and initiatives have created a truly\r\nnew opportunity for strengthening cooperation and\r\nfacilitating the integration of developing countries into\r\nthe world economy. The turning point was the adoption\r\nof the Millennium Declaration, in which the heads of\r\nState and heads of Government agreed upon ambitious\r\ndevelopment goals. The third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, and\r\nparticularly the preparatory process for the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, have also been important forums for\r\ntackling major existing challenges in economic\r\ncooperation for development.\r\nThe Czech Republic attaches great importance to\r\nthe development goals of the United Nations. To\r\nachieve the majority of these specific complex\r\ndevelopment goals by 2015 will require numerous\r\nbroadly based actions by various players, be they\r\nnational Governments, international organizations,\r\ncivil society organizations or private-sector entities.\r\nOur perception is that the United Nations should play a\r\ncentral role in building coalitions for the full\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. That is\r\nwhy we strongly support all initiatives that have led to\r\nconsultations and cooperation between the United\r\nNations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), particularly within the\r\npreparatory process of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the question of\r\nfinancing for development will be considered at the\r\nnext joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund\r\n(IMF) meeting of the Development Committee and that\r\na possible development dimension of a new round of\r\ntrade negotiations is now the subject of intensive\r\nconsultations. We also welcome the significant\r\noutreach to the business sector and civil society which\r\nhas taken place within the preparatory process on\r\nfinancing for development and the Global Partnership\r\nInitiative. We believe that all these processes will\r\nestablish close collaboration and a better-coordinated\r\napproach in the implementation of the follow-up to the\r\nMillennium Declaration and, moreover, that they will\r\nstrengthen the focus on development in international\r\neconomic cooperation and perhaps make the\r\ninternational economic architecture more development-\r\noriented.\r\nThe development dimension of international\r\neconomic cooperation has enormous implications for\r\nthe integration of developing countries and countries in\r\ntransition into the global economy. However, an\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nenabling international environment is not enough. It\r\ncan have a supportive and catalytic impact, but each\r\ndeveloping country and country in transition bears the\r\nprimary responsibility for its own development and\r\nintegration into the world economy.\r\nThe countries themselves must be the driving\r\nforce in their integration. They need to develop\r\nconsistent, country-driven poverty-reduction and\r\ndevelopment strategies which would set development\r\ngoals at the country level and establish a basis for\r\nsound and coherent macroeconomic financial and trade\r\npolicies, while embracing economic as well as social\r\nfactors of development.\r\nIn this context, let me point out that the Poverty\r\nReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which is currently\r\nbeing introduced by the IMF in the least developed\r\ncountries, is an exceptionally important instrument, as\r\nit introduces a new approach to development by\r\nprioritizing consistent, country-driven development\r\nstrategies and coherent policies, with a supporting role\r\nto be played by international development partners.\r\nTherefore, we believe that this kind of development\r\nstrategy should be widely applied in developing and in\r\ntransition countries.\r\nMy last point relates to regional cooperation. In\r\nthis connection, I welcome document HLD/CRP.3,\r\nwhich provides us with valuable data about new trends\r\nand regional perspectives on globalization. It also\r\nprovides evidence of how immensely important\r\nregional cooperation is. It is a very suitable format for\r\nboth trade relationships and for foreign direct\r\ninvestment. In our view, the potential of regional\r\ncooperation has not been fully recognized yet,\r\nparticularly in financial and monetary matters.\r\nThe Czech delegation is convinced that\r\nappropriate and more focused attention should be given\r\nto regional cooperation and integration, as well as to\r\nthe extremely pressing issues of globalization and\r\ninterdependence.\r\nMr. El Atrash (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): This being the first time that I have taken\r\nthe floor since your assumption of the presidency of\r\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, it is a\r\npleasure for me first and foremost warmly to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, and to wish you every success in\r\nyour task.\r\nLet me take this opportunity also to express to\r\nyour predecessor our full appreciation and gratitude for\r\nhis outstanding efforts and wise leadership during the\r\nprevious session of the General Assembly.\r\nI am particularly pleased also to thank you, Sir,\r\nfor your efforts in guiding this high-level dialogue on\r\nstrengthening international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership.\r\nThis meeting is being held just a few days after\r\nthe horrible terrorist acts that struck New York City;\r\nWashington, D.C.; and Pennsylvania, killing thousands\r\nof innocent victims. I wish to take this opportunity to\r\nconvey our most heartfelt sympathy and condolences to\r\nthe people of the United States and to the families of\r\nthe victims. This heinous terrorist act is not condoned\r\nby divine religious or civil laws; it is the work of\r\ncriminals, and given that my country has been one of\r\nthose most affected by terrorism, we wish in this\r\nrespect to reiterate the need to combat terrorism in all\r\nits forms through action that is adopted and guided by\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe welcome with satisfaction the meeting that\r\nthe United Nations will be holding at the beginning of\r\nOctober aimed at fighting terrorism, and we hope that\r\nits objectives will be attained.\r\nWe are very aware of the importance of this\r\ndialogue, because it represents a comprehensive global\r\nassessment and review of all of the efforts made to\r\ndate. In this regard, it is vital to stress the importance\r\nof integrating the developing countries in the\r\ninternational economy and to strengthen international\r\neconomic cooperation, because this is one of the most\r\ncomplex issues confronting us at the beginning of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nGlobalization is leading to crises and facing\r\nmajor opposition, for reasons that we believe are quite\r\nclear. With the opening of markets, freedom of trade\r\nhas generated unprecedented wealth in certain areas of\r\nthe world, but the distribution of this wealth has not\r\nbeen equitable. Globalization has not benefited the\r\npoor, so the promise of a better life in developing\r\ncountries has been generally hard to fulfil.\r\nThis is the danger that globalization holds for the\r\npoor countries: not only the worsening and domination\r\nof their markets but also the abandonment of these\r\ncountries and the neglect of any improvement to their\r\neconomic situation.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nIt is very important to discuss poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. The challenge presented by poverty\r\nis urgent and vital. It seems that any progress in this\r\narea is extremely slow in coming. As to the current\r\neconomic trends, dozens of countries, representing two\r\nthirds of the world’s population, still live in conditions\r\nof underdevelopment. They cannot make economic\r\nprogress, participate in the international economy or\r\nbenefit from modern technology in order to modernize\r\ntheir trade institutions and markets.\r\nWe in the developing countries and markets,\r\nparticularly in Africa — where less than 1 per cent of\r\nthe population has access to Internet, compared to 45\r\nper cent in North America — favour the current high-\r\nlevel dialogue, which would enable the developing\r\ncountries to be integrated into the world economy and\r\nthe global information network, thus strengthening the\r\ncapacities of private and public institutions. The\r\ndialogue could enable us to achieve progress in the\r\ndevelopment of the global economy, taking into\r\naccount the specific nature and possibilities of the\r\ndeveloping countries. It could enable us to create a new\r\nworld order that should promote trade and development\r\nand prosperity for all, especially developing countries.\r\nIf we really wish to improve the prevailing\r\nsituation, and if we wish globalization to become a\r\ndynamic and positive force that is available to people,\r\nthe international community has to introduce radical\r\nchanges at the national and global levels, changes that\r\nshould pay special attention to Africa because Africa is\r\nthe continent most at risk of failure in achieving these\r\nobjectives.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China has been aware of\r\nthese realities for a long time and it is for this reason\r\nthat this group, last year in Havana, adopted a bold and\r\nambitious declaration and programme of action to\r\nestablish a new humanitarian world order that would\r\nfacilitate the integration of the developing countries\r\ninto a world economy. The declaration’s programme\r\nwould allow us to achieve our common objectives: a\r\nmore just and equitable future and the end of\r\nunderdevelopment and poverty. It would also promote\r\ndevelopment on an equal footing.\r\nThis is the role that embodies our desires and\r\nobjectives and that we should play at the threshold of\r\nthe new millennium. We are fully aware that the\r\nworking plan adopted by the Group of 77 and China\r\nlast year and the synergy of world politics to achieve\r\nour common constructive goals, as personified by the\r\nMillennium Declaration of the United Nations last\r\nSeptember, can become a positive factor for all peoples\r\nof the world. In order to achieve an effective form of\r\npartnership, the developing countries need to\r\nstrengthen international economic cooperation for\r\ndevelopment through partnership.\r\nIn order to be able to achieve this goal, it is a\r\npleasure for me to say that my country is carrying out\r\npractical and real measures towards development on\r\nthe national and global levels. My country is\r\nimplementing the Havana programme and the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration of last September.\r\nHowever, whatever happens, without a real worldwide\r\neffort, we cannot build true globalization. The northern\r\ncountries need to enthusiastically and sincerely practice\r\nwhat they have been preaching and promising for\r\nseveral years and try to alter the situation for the poor\r\nwho have been marginalized for long decades. It is\r\nhigh time to approve and implement new measures in\r\norder to alter the sad reality we are witnessing. If\r\ndeveloped countries are truly committed to using trade\r\nto promote development, they need to formulate\r\nserious and specific measures and strengthen them. Let\r\nus recall here the upcoming international meetings: the\r\nministerial-level meeting in Doha of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development to be held\r\nin Johannesburg. All these events and conferences\r\ncould be an opportunity to discuss the possibility of\r\nspeeding up the process of globalization and\r\npartnership. Such a partnership would be more global\r\nin character and would try to take up extremely\r\nimportant measures to break down existing barriers, to\r\ndiscuss debt alleviation for the poor countries, to help\r\nthe developing countries and to commit to honouring\r\nthe principle of sustainable development. Thus, on all\r\nfronts, we observe the importance of pushing forward\r\nwith a dialogue on the promotion of economic world\r\ncooperation for development through partnership, and\r\nof enriching and broadening international dialogue in\r\nthis area.\r\nAllow me to conclude by saying that my country\r\nwill make every effort to strengthen international\r\neconomic cooperation for development through\r\npartnership and that we will be an active partner within\r\nthe United Nations family in the various efforts carried\r\nout by this family. We are committed to building on the\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nbasis of partnership on all levels. We are committed to\r\nachieving all the objectives contained in the Havana\r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Declaration. We wish\r\nevery success for this dialogue so that it can attain its\r\nexpected objectives.\r\nMr. Singhara Na Ayudhaya (Thailand): Before I\r\nbegin, please allow me to join my colleagues in\r\nexpressing on behalf of the Government and people of\r\nThailand our sincere sympathy and deepest\r\ncondolences to the President, the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States of America, especially to\r\nthose who have lost their loved ones in the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September.\r\nI would like to extend my congratulations to the\r\nPresident on his election as President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. I am\r\nconfident that his leadership and vast experience will\r\nundoubtedly guide us to the session’s successful\r\nconclusion, especially at a time when we are facing an\r\nextremely difficult situation. You can rest assured of\r\nmy delegation’s full cooperation towards the success of\r\nthis meeting.\r\nI wish to associate my delegation with the\r\nstatement delivered by the distinguished representative\r\nof Iran, the chairman of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nGlobalization is seen today as a process that\r\nintegrates and democratizes the world’s culture,\r\neconomy, and infrastructure. However, it should not be\r\nseen as an inevitable force that is beyond our control.\r\nRather, globalization should be seen as a result of\r\ninteractions among its key components, such as\r\nliberalization, multilateral trade and financial\r\ninstitutions and the policies and decisions of different\r\ncountries, as well as cooperation among and within the\r\nvarious groupings. More importantly, globalization is\r\ndriven by the rapid proliferation of information and\r\ncommunication technology.\r\nOne of the main challenges we are facing today is\r\nhow best to handle this ongoing process so that it will\r\nfully benefit all of us, especially those developing\r\ncountries that have limited or no capability to cope\r\nwith the new reality. In order to maximize the benefits\r\nof globalization, countries are required to have sound\r\ndomestic policies and to improve their domestic\r\ncapacities, including financial and structural reforms,\r\nto keep pace with the globalized world. Indeed, some\r\nof us are doing our best in this reform effort.\r\nFurthermore, there is also a need to create an enabling\r\ninternational environment. A level playing field alone\r\nis not adequate to address the growing disparity or the\r\never-larger gap between the developed and developing\r\ncountries. Developing countries need to be assisted in\r\ntheir capacity-building so that they can fully reap the\r\nbenefits of globalization in such areas as trade,\r\ninvestment, finance and technology. Genuine\r\ninternational economic cooperation and genuine efforts\r\nin good faith are needed in this regard.\r\nThailand recognizes that developing countries can\r\ngenerate economic growth through economic\r\nliberalization. However, liberalization must be done in\r\na progressive manner or step by step in accordance\r\nwith the degree of readiness. Liberalization has to be\r\nflexible and take place with due respect to national\r\npolicy objectives and the level of development of each\r\ncountry. This step-by-step participation is possible and\r\nallowed for under both the International Monetary\r\nFund and the World Trade Organization agreements.\r\nAlthough globalization is a potentially dynamic\r\nforce for growth and development for developing\r\ncountries, it can also be a serious threat to vulnerable\r\neconomies with limited capacity. The recent financial\r\ncrisis in Asia has vividly illustrated that developing\r\ncountries that have previously enjoyed rapid economic\r\ngrowth are still not well equipped with crisis\r\nmanagement and are vulnerable to world economic\r\nfluctuation. In light of this, Thailand supports a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the international financial\r\narchitecture that can provide a better mechanism for\r\ncrisis management and make it more conducive to trade\r\nand development for developing countries.\r\nRegional and subregional arrangements can\r\neffectively assist developing countries in their efforts\r\nto become integrated into the world economy. Hence,\r\nthe countries of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations are fully committed and working closely\r\ntowards economic integration within the region. The\r\nGreater Mekong subregion, which includes Cambodia,\r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar,\r\nThailand, Viet Nam and Yunnan Province of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China, is another subregion in\r\nwhich countries are working together closely to\r\naccelerate their development in the framework of the\r\nDecade of the Greater Mekong Subregion Development\r\nCooperation. In the larger picture, Thailand also fully\r\nsupports the strengthening of South-South cooperation\r\nin the integration of countries of the South into the\r\nworld economy.\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nAt the international level, Thailand also has high\r\nhopes for the success of the International Conference\r\non Financing for Development to be convened in\r\nMonterrey, Mexico, between 18 and 22 March 2002.\r\nThe main purposes of this International Conference are\r\nto address national, international and systemic issues\r\nrelating to financing for development in a holistic\r\nmanner in the context of globalization and\r\ninterdependence; and to address the mobilization of\r\nfinancial resources to reach the goals set by the major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits organized\r\nduring the 1990s, including the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. In this regard, Thailand wishes to stress\r\nthat its agenda – which covers six areas, such as\r\nforeign direct investment and other private flows,\r\ntrade, official development assistance and systemic\r\nissues – is very important to and will impact on the\r\ndevelopment and integration of the developing\r\ncountries into the world economy.\r\nTurning to the second agenda item of this\r\nmeeting, Thailand believes that information and\r\ncommunication technology plays a vital role in and is\r\npart and parcel of the globalization process.\r\nInformation networks also enhance the efficiency and\r\nquality of life by reducing the physical and time\r\nbarriers. In order to induce people to use information\r\ntechnology, developing countries need to create a\r\nsufficient level of telecommunication service that is\r\nboth reliable and inexpensive, with priority given to the\r\nconstruction of better telecommunication and\r\nnetworking infrastructure.\r\nThailand recognizes that liberalization in the area\r\nof telecommunications is an effective way to achieve\r\nhigher quality information systems. However, such a\r\nprocess must take place in a progressive manner with\r\ndue respect for national policy objectives and level of\r\ndevelopment. The liberalization process should also\r\nfocus on consumer protection, fair competition, fair\r\npricing, service licensing and stipulation of penalty.\r\nThailand believes that developing countries\r\nshould be concerned not only with the number of\r\ntelecommunication network connections, but also with\r\nthe number of people who gain access to these\r\nconnections and the level of their knowledge to make\r\nfull use of the information and communication\r\ntechnologies. Therefore, communications links should\r\nbe promoted simultaneously with computer training\r\nand human capacity-building in order to ensure\r\nmaximum usage of the available technology.\r\nThailand also recognizes that e-government,\r\nwhich involves the digitalization of information and\r\nthe provision of on-line transaction of public services,\r\nis an important impetus for many developing countries\r\nin the development of national communication\r\ninfrastructure. It can significantly help accelerate the\r\nintegration of a country into the global network. We are\r\nthus working towards the enhancement of our capacity\r\nin this direction. However, I do believe that many\r\ndeveloping countries – indeed, including us – will still\r\nneed some kind of overseas technical assistance in this\r\narea.\r\nThailand thus shares the wide concern that\r\ndeveloping countries are increasingly becoming\r\nmarginalized by not being able to keep up with the\r\ndynamism of technological changes, especially as\r\naccess to global networks, new information technology\r\nand advanced services become the main driving forces\r\nof integration into the world economy. Therefore, there\r\nmust be international cooperation on the transfer of\r\ninformation and communication technology, as well as\r\nassistance in human-capacity building in this area. Also\r\nneeded are research and development initiatives that\r\nwill help equip developing countries with the needed\r\ntechnological knowledge in order to prevent the further\r\nwidening of the existing digital divide. In this regard,\r\nThailand fully supports the role of the United Nations\r\nin promoting development in the context of\r\nglobalization and interdependence, especially in the\r\ndimension of technology, and the work of the United\r\nNations Information and Communication Technology\r\nTask Force that was recently set up. For our part, we\r\nwill render our full cooperation towards the success of\r\nthis Task Force and beyond.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): Let me first express our\r\ndeep sympathy and condolences to the United States\r\nGovernment and the American people at the\r\nincalculable loss of life and damage to property in the\r\nhorrible terrorist attacks on United States landmarks on\r\n11 September 2001. Our hearts go out to those who lost\r\ntheir loved ones in the tragedy.\r\nI would like to begin by congratulating you,\r\nMr. President, on your well deserved election to lead\r\nthe world’s foremost representative body. My\r\ndelegation has full confidence in your ability to steer\r\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nThe high-level dialogue on twin issues of widely\r\nshared interest is timely and topical. It provides us a\r\nwelcome opportunity to put our heads and experiences\r\ntogether to hammer out a global strategy to make\r\nglobalization and information technology work for all\r\ncountries and for every man and woman around the\r\nplanet.\r\nGlobalization has failed the poor, as has the\r\ninformation revolution. Here is a stark example.\r\nAccording to the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme Administrator, some 66 countries are now\r\npoorer than they were a decade ago. The gap between\r\nthe rich and poor has widened tremendously. Clearly, it\r\nhas coincided with the ascendancy of both\r\nglobalization and the information revolution.\r\nThis regression has thrown us off the moral perch\r\nthat we take for granted as caring and civilized human\r\nbeings, and has stricken our conscience and diminished\r\nour humanity. We all have been collectively indicted —\r\nthose who fell, and those who let them fall off the cliff.\r\nOpponents of globalization are gaining strength.\r\nThey have a point: globalization is not really global.\r\nAnd the information revolution has come in handy for\r\nexpanding their network. Opposition to the information\r\nrevolution may begin to build if it remains exclusive as\r\nwell. Conscious and coherent efforts, therefore, are\r\nessential to make these mutually reinforcing forces\r\ninclusive before developing countries are compelled to\r\ngive up in sheer frustration and desperation.\r\nPromoting the integration of developing countries\r\ninto the global economy and into the global\r\ninformation network basically entails similar\r\nsignificant measures: building capacity, enhancing\r\naccess and ensuring fairness and justice.\r\nDeveloping countries must have the capacity to\r\nengage in trade, which is generated through the\r\nremoval of supply-side constraints. They can increase\r\ntheir exports only if they have products and services to\r\nsell, and increase their imports only if their people\r\nhave incomes to spend. The production of tradable\r\ngoods and services and creation of incomes require\r\ntechnology and also investment in primary, secondary\r\nand tertiary sectors that create jobs and economic\r\nopportunities for people.\r\nTo attract foreign and domestic investment, poor\r\ncountries need economic and social infrastructure —\r\nroads, power, communications, markets, quality\r\neducation, health services and an appropriate legal and\r\ninstitutional framework. Most developing countries\r\ncannot create the necessary infrastructure without\r\noutside help.\r\nEssentially, the integration of the developing\r\nworld into the global economy necessitates\r\ncomprehensive and integrated national development.\r\nTo get the ball rolling, developing countries will need a\r\nsubstantially enhanced, a front-loaded official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) package, deeper and\r\nwider debt relief and strengthened institutional\r\ncapacities that can create impetus for investment and\r\ntrade. But over the last several years, there has been a\r\nnet decline in ODA flows, particularly to the least\r\ndeveloped countries. Nepal appreciates those countries\r\nthat have met the ODA targets and those that are trying\r\nto do so.\r\nThe Zedillo Panel has estimated that an additional\r\n$50 billion will be needed annually to meet the\r\ndevelopment goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the bulk of which will have to come from\r\nthe North. Far-reaching steps become imperative to\r\nraise such resources. Therefore, the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Meeting in Qatar later\r\nthis year should launch a genuine development round\r\nof negotiations to build the capacity of developing\r\ncountries to trade as an integral part of national\r\ndevelopment schemes. The Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development next year should be used as an\r\nopportunity to cement global partnership for the\r\nprogress of developing countries, with particular focus\r\non the least developed countries in Africa and\r\nelsewhere.\r\nIt is absolutely crucial for developing countries to\r\nenjoy unfettered access to markets up North, as the\r\ndeveloped countries do in the South, to sustain their\r\ntrade and development. We applaud the fact that the\r\nEuropean Union has taken a bold first step through the\r\n“Everything but arms” scheme for least developed\r\ncountries, and urge others to follow suit. Letting the\r\nleast developed countries join the WTO is also\r\nnecessary for their integration into global trade.\r\nLandlocked developing countries, lacking direct\r\naccess to sea and having to incur high transit-transport\r\ncosts, need additional help to overcome these serious\r\nbottlenecks hindering their development and to\r\npromote integration into the global economy.\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nThen comes the question of fairness and justice,\r\nbased on predictable rules of the game. The developing\r\ncountries have always complained about the new\r\ntrading regime not providing a level playing field.\r\nProtectionism is the bane of free trade, but it is still\r\nprevalent, and all the more so in rich counties. For\r\ninstance, the huge subsidies for agriculture, textile and\r\nsome other labour-intensive sectors and the tariff and\r\nnon-tariff walls in the North critically jeopardize the\r\ndeveloping world’s capacity to compete in rich-country\r\nmarkets. Intellectual property rights must be\r\njudiciously used so that the traditional modes of\r\nproduction in poor countries are not jeopardized.\r\nSimilarly, to be integrated into the emergent\r\nglobal information network, developing countries will\r\nneed to have improved national capacities to process\r\nand use information. People must have jobs and\r\nincomes to be able to afford the necessary hardware\r\nand software, roads to transport them to potential users,\r\nadvanced and reliable telecommunications facilities to\r\nwhich they can connect, education, which is essential if\r\nthey are to profit from information, a commercially\r\nviable market and so on. This cannot be viewed in\r\nisolation from a larger national development picture.\r\nAccess to information is equally important to\r\nintegrating the world in an information network.\r\nWithout the availability of information on the network\r\nfrom government, civil society and the private sector,\r\nsuch innovative concepts as e-government,\r\ne-commerce, e-education, tele-medicine, e-research,\r\nand so on cannot be possible. Developing countries\r\nrequire know-how and support from outside to put such\r\nsystems in place and, from within, the evolution of a\r\nculture of transparency and openness and willingness\r\nto share information.\r\nFor developing countries to take substantial\r\nadvantage of the global information network, they must\r\nhave room to participate in it meaningfully, particularly\r\nin terms of managing information. Control of global\r\ninformation by a few giants, which are further\r\nconsolidating, hardly helps to create a conducive\r\nclimate for the South to join and effectively engage in\r\nthe network.\r\nThe Information and Communications\r\nTechnology (ICT) Working Group established by the\r\nUnited Nations and the Digital Opportunity Task Force\r\nof the Group of 8 are preludes to emerging partnerships\r\nto bridge the digital divide. They should seriously look\r\ninto these critical problems and work out modalities for\r\nforging deeper partnerships within and among\r\ncountries so that developing countries can be integrated\r\ninto the global information network. The 2002\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and other relevant forums should also\r\nlook into the financing and technical cooperation\r\naspects of this issue.\r\nIn essence, we are talking about a transformation\r\nin our collective attitudes, economies, societies and\r\npolitical relations to give globalization a human face.\r\nThis calls for vision, statesmanship and political will to\r\nwork for shared well-being and shared progress. On\r\none level, it is an act of humanity and compassion for\r\nadvanced countries to help their less privileged\r\ncounterparts to attain sustainable development. But\r\nmore important, it will be in the enlightened self-\r\ninterest of the rich to help their poor brethren so that\r\nthey do not have to spend their fortune keeping aliens\r\naway from their borders and keeping criminals at bay.\r\nPoverty is not the destiny of the South. It is a\r\nproduct of complex social and economic phenomena\r\nsteeped in history. No country, by choice, wants to\r\nremain poor, but not all countries or civilizations have\r\ngrown simultaneously. That is the principal basis for\r\nwider and deeper cooperation across the globe for the\r\ncommon good.\r\nDeveloping countries seek partnership to help\r\ntrigger growth in their countries, to create jobs, to\r\nimprove education and health services and to alleviate\r\npoverty. They want to learn how to fish rather than\r\nsimply being given the fish itself. Those are goals the\r\nMillennium Declaration set for us, and here we should\r\nnot fail our heads of State or Government.\r\nEvery crisis spawns opportunity and reinforces\r\nresolve. The world is now in an economic slump.\r\nPerhaps we can convert it into an opportunity of sorts\r\nby putting together a global economic stimulus\r\npackage capable of making globalization and\r\ninformation technology work for every man and\r\nwoman around the world.\r\nMr. Clodumar (Nauru): I have the honour to\r\nspeak at this important meeting on behalf of the States\r\nmembers of the Pacific Islands Forum represented at\r\nthe United Nations. Our group believes that this\r\ndialogue is timely, and that it is especially relevant at\r\nthis unique time as we prepare for next year’s global\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nmeetings on financing for development and on\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe all generally agree that the process of\r\nglobalization has created significant new opportunities\r\nfor developing countries to be integrated into the world\r\ntrading, financial and information systems. At the same\r\ntime, however, it was known that globalization was\r\nlikely to pose substantial new challenges for countries\r\nthrough, for instance, the high transitional costs arising\r\nfrom market liberalization. As we have found in our\r\nown region, the new opportunities cannot and will not\r\nbe fully realized unless there is a concomitant creation\r\nof constructive mechanisms for the financing and\r\ntransfer of the requisite knowledge and technology.\r\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, globalization remains\r\nan enigma. The larger “tiger” economies have indeed\r\nbenefited, but the gap between the faster-growing and\r\nslower-growing economies in the region has widened\r\nin nearly all respects. The fear is that the latter risk\r\nbeing further marginalized, the small Pacific island\r\neconomies in particular, whose long-term development\r\nprospects have shown little improvement.\r\nWhat, then, are the policy options available to the\r\ndeveloping world? The reports of the regional\r\ncommissions compiled in conference room paper 3\r\noutline some general guidelines in dealing with\r\nglobalization, but it is generally understood that there\r\nare no easy answers yet. Whatever global, regional or\r\nnational strategies are born of meetings such as ours\r\ntoday, it is becoming increasingly obvious that\r\nGovernments need to devise better policy responses\r\nthat take more realistic account of their own unique\r\ncircumstances. This applies particularly to the Pacific\r\nsubregion, where there is growing recognition of the\r\nneed to develop and strengthen the interface among\r\neconomic, environmental and social policies, including\r\nthe challenges imposed by the greater vulnerability that\r\nglobalization has brought to our countries.\r\nThe 1994 Barbados Programme of Action for the\r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\r\nStates drew the world’s attention to the problems\r\nfacing small island States; if anything, those problems\r\nhave increased in both intensity and urgency. Because\r\nof small country size and remoteness, an overemphasis\r\non public-sector-led development strategies and gaps in\r\ntechnological capabilities, the Pacific islands in\r\nparticular face special difficulties in making the\r\nglobalization transition. Adjustment to the external\r\ntrade regime and the sequencing of changes in our\r\neconomies will therefore take time and careful\r\nplanning. To that end, clear signals about the direction\r\nof domestic trade and regulatory policies are needed to\r\nguide the process and to attract new investment. For\r\nour part, we are learning the importance of subregional\r\ncooperation and solidarity in allowing for relative\r\nefficiency and economies of scale, which has perhaps\r\nbeen one of the bright spots in our experience so far.\r\nWhile the world works to develop and implement\r\neffective strategies to address development and\r\nglobalization, we must keep in mind the need to apply\r\nthe general principles of country ownership,\r\nparticipation, partnership and a holistic approach to\r\ndiagnosis and policy development to the special\r\ncharacteristics of marginalized economies. Much of\r\nthis vernacular has been adopted by development\r\nagencies, but Governments and the private sector need\r\nto commit to such a model also, through both advocacy\r\nand the provision of technical assistance. For the small\r\neconomies of the Pacific region, specific issues might\r\ninclude: taking appropriate account of the special\r\ncircumstances of small island developing States and\r\nensuring that any graduation from least developed\r\ncountry status is not premature; ensuring the provision\r\nof policy advice and technical assistance with regard to\r\ntrade and investment; sharpening of advocacy roles and\r\npursuing commitments from the United Nations system\r\nand others to include vulnerability as an additional\r\ncriterion in determining treatment of small States on\r\nissues such as graduation, aid flows, development\r\nstrategies and investment; and, very important,\r\nsupporting private sector development, especially in\r\nterms of education and training, creating improved\r\nregulatory frameworks and infrastructure development,\r\nand in terms of the policies and investments needed to\r\nexploit the opportunities that information and\r\ncommunications technology (ICT) can bring.\r\nIn this respect, our Group acknowledges the\r\npledge made by the Japanese Government at the\r\nMillennium Summit of a $15 billion commitment to the\r\ntask of bridging the digital divide. We keenly await\r\nconfirmation of the mechanisms for our countries to\r\neffectively participate in such fruitful and constructive\r\noffers.\r\nSustainable development is important to us, but\r\nwe are discovering that the emerging tools to promote\r\nit are equally important. The opportunities that\r\ninformation technology and electronic commerce can\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nbring to small isolated States suggest that these\r\ntechnologies can be a major source of help both in our\r\ndevelopment and in our integration into the global\r\neconomy.\r\nBut we need assistance in understanding and\r\nusing these new tools. We also need assistance in the\r\ndissemination of these technologies throughout our\r\nvarious sectors, both public and private, and, most\r\nimportantly, within our educational institutions. The\r\ndigital divide must be bridged in a constructive\r\nmanner.\r\nFinally, while the ongoing process of\r\nglobalization may be beyond our control, ultimately the\r\ndegree of our subregion’s future integration will\r\ndepend on our efforts and resolve. But to assist the\r\nsmall economies of the Pacific in pursuing the twin\r\ngoals of global integration and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the international community must offer\r\nboth encouragement and support in our endeavours,\r\nand in doing so help make globalization a positive\r\nforce for all.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nIn the first place, I would like to associate myself with\r\nthe remarks of Ambassador Bagher Asadi made\r\nyesterday morning on behalf of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina. I have asked to speak to insist on one single\r\npoint: the importance of giving real content to the word\r\n“partnership”.\r\nIn effect, the diverse subjects that appear in the\r\ntitle of this exceptional one-and-a-half day debate are\r\nthe bread and butter of our everyday activities.\r\nDialogue, international cooperation and partnership for\r\ndevelopment are all concepts at the very core of what\r\nthe United Nations is and should be about. They have\r\nthe potential of furthering the welfare of humanity,\r\nstrengthening the United Nations and fostering fruitful\r\nand productive relations between all nations. However,\r\nthey also have the potential to divide, weaken and\r\ncontribute to moving backwards in the development\r\nprocess.\r\nThere are different interpretations of what these\r\nconcepts mean. In addition, each time we meet to\r\naddress these topics there is, behind the courteous and\r\nsometimes rhetorical phrases, a certain amount of\r\nfinger-pointing. Basically, the developed countries tend\r\nto make the developing countries responsible for their\r\nown plight, putting the emphasis on ill-conceived\r\npublic policies, weak institutions, high levels of\r\ncorruption and a lack of leadership. Developing\r\ncountries, for their part, tend to blame the international\r\nenvironment, emphasizing lack of access to markets,\r\nlack of access to technologies and lack of access to\r\nfinancing, as well as public policies that tend to\r\nmarginalize poor sectors and countries, depriving them\r\nof the fruits of economic growth. The main point is that\r\nboth arguments are valid, depending on the vantage\r\npoint of the interlocutor. At the very least, there are\r\nelements of truth in these opposing and somewhat\r\nstylized visions.\r\nThat is why the real significance of our meetings\r\nperhaps is not limited to what Louise Fréchette asked\r\nof us yesterday morning: to explore specific ideas to\r\nfurther the agenda of cooperation. There are, of course,\r\ncountless ideas already on the table regarding the main\r\naspects that form part of that agenda. These will feed\r\ninto, among others, our own International Conference\r\non Financing for Development; the upcoming\r\nMinisterial Meeting of the World Trade Organization to\r\nbe held in Doha; the commitments already made at\r\nvarious United Nations global conferences; the\r\nguidelines in the Millennium Declaration; and the steps\r\nto be taken by the Information and Communication\r\nTechnologies Task Force designed to narrow the digital\r\ndivide. Hopefully, we will be able to add the issue of\r\ninternational migrations to this list of topics.\r\nBut the effect of all commitments — those\r\nalready made and those yet to be adopted — could be\r\ngreatly maximized if they were applied in a true spirit\r\nof partnership, where domestic efforts made overcome\r\nthe main obstacles to development are complemented\r\nand enriched by a renewed effort in the realm of\r\ninternational cooperation. In other words, we must\r\ncomplement specific proposals with a change in\r\nattitude, where all — rich and poor countries alike —\r\nassume our individual and collective responsibilities to\r\nachieve development and reduce poverty.\r\nWe therefore trust that this will be the spirit in\r\nwhich we continue this dialogue within the framework\r\nboth of the United Nations and of other multilateral\r\nforums. Along those lines, we trust that regional\r\ncooperation will be enhanced as part of that global\r\neffort. It is the least that the peoples of the globe can\r\nexpect of us.\r\nMr. Shihab (Maldives): As I take the floor for\r\nthe first time this session, I would like to join earlier\r\nspeakers in extending to you, Sir, very warm\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\ncongratulations on your election as the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session. I would\r\nalso like to assure you of my delegation’s full support.\r\nAllow me also to extend my country’s heartfelt\r\nsympathy and condolences to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States on the tremendous loss of\r\nlife caused by the brutal and cowardly acts of\r\ninternational terrorism on 11 September 2001. My\r\ncountry stands ready to actively assist and provide its\r\nfull cooperation in any way that it can in the\r\ninternational action to rid the world of the scourge of\r\nterrorism.\r\nNo one doubts today that globalization is a reality\r\nand not a choice. Over the past two decades, the\r\nprocess of globalization has become pervasive,\r\naffecting all countries and segments of society. While it\r\nhas brought unprecedented opportunities for economic\r\nadvancement, it has, at the same time, posed severe\r\nchallenges, particularly to the developing countries.\r\nThe benefits of globalization have not been shared\r\nequally among all countries or within countries\r\nthemselves. Indeed, while the volume of world trade\r\nand cross-border international investment has\r\nsignificantly increased, so has abject poverty.\r\nIt is readily apparent that the entire process of\r\nglobal economic integration has been asymmetrical.\r\nAfter more than two decades of economic reform\r\naimed at greater integration into the global economy,\r\nmost developing countries, especially the least\r\ndeveloped countries, still find themselves marginalized\r\nin terms of economic growth, industrial output and\r\ntrade, and run the risk of further marginalization. While\r\nlinkages between developing countries have expanded\r\nsignificantly in recent years, the majority of the flows\r\nof the benefits of economic integration have tended to\r\nbe concentrated in only a few of the larger developing\r\ncountries.\r\nThe intensified circuits of trade, capital flows,\r\nforeign investment, technology transfers and the\r\nactivities of transnational enterprises have largely\r\nbypassed the poorest and the least developed countries.\r\nIndeed, estimates show that, although they have 10 per\r\ncent of the world’s population, the least developed\r\ncountries account for only 0.4 per cent of world trade.\r\nThe developed countries account for a disproportionate\r\nshare of the world’s flow of foreign direct investment,\r\naccounting for over 90 per cent, while the rest of the\r\nworld — with almost 70 per cent of its population — is\r\nable to attract less than 10 per cent of such\r\ninvestments. While global foreign direct investment to\r\nthe least developed countries may have grown slightly\r\nover the years, their share still stands as low as 0.5 per\r\ncent. At the same time, official development assistance\r\nto the least developed countries has declined\r\nconsiderably.\r\nAs we deliberate upon the theme of strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development\r\nthrough partnership, my country believes that we\r\nshould pay particular heed to the specific needs and\r\nvulnerabilities of small island developing countries\r\nsuch as Maldives. The small island developing States\r\nare striving to come to grips with the challenges and\r\nopportunities offered by globalization through the\r\nliberalization of world trade, increased access to\r\nmarkets, international technology transfers and greater\r\ncapital flow across national borders. The small island\r\ndeveloping States are among not only the world’s\r\npoorest nations but also the most vulnerable. Their\r\nmarkets are small; their labour — both in terms of\r\nquantity and quality — is limited; and their economies\r\nare narrowly based, as they are often compelled to be\r\ndependent on one or two products, which tend to be\r\nsusceptible to external forces beyond their control.\r\nIf they are to reap the benefits of greater\r\nintegration into the world economy, the small island\r\ndeveloping States need to be able to diversify their\r\nmarkets, increase the skills of their labour force and\r\nstrengthen their social and economic infrastructure.\r\nThey need to increase their share of the global flow of\r\nforeign direct investment. The least developed\r\ncountries, especially the smaller island States among\r\nthem, therefore need more time and a sympathetic\r\nunderstanding of their particular problems by the wider\r\ninternational community, so that they are not\r\nmarginalized further.\r\nOver the past two decades, Maldives has achieved\r\nmuch progress and made important strides in its social\r\nand economic development. Our successes have been\r\nlargely dependent on political stability and prudent\r\npolicies, aided by the generous economic assistance\r\nextended to us, as a least developed country, by the\r\ninternational community. However, it appears that the\r\ninternational community is about to penalize us for the\r\nsuccesses that we have achieved. I refer to the\r\nimpending graduation of my country from the list of\r\nleast developed countries.\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nAs this Assembly is aware, there have been\r\nattempts in the recent past to graduate small island\r\ndeveloping States from the list of the least developed\r\ncountries on the grounds that statistically they fulfil the\r\nrequired criteria for such graduation. A closer and\r\nmore careful look at these cases, however, has justified\r\nthe continued retention of these States in the least\r\ndeveloped country category, since the realities on the\r\nground in such island States are too severe to be\r\nignored; abstract indicators alone cannot be relied\r\nupon.\r\nAt times like these, when the entire global\r\neconomy is faced with tremendous uncertainty, the\r\nimpact on structurally weak economies such as that of\r\nMaldives can be too overwhelming for them to cope on\r\ntheir own without the continued assistance of the\r\ninternational community. We believe that the\r\ninternational community has a primary obligation to\r\nassist these countries in their efforts to integrate into\r\nthe world economy. The fulfilment of the unequivocal\r\ncommitments of the international community to\r\nencourage and to promote foreign direct investment\r\nflows into the least developed countries, to honour\r\nofficial development assistance targets and to help the\r\nleast developed countries to build their institutional\r\ncapacity to enhance their access to the world market is\r\nextremely critical for the least developed countries if\r\nthey are to avoid further isolation.\r\nMy country believes that the blueprint for\r\neffectively tackling the problems faced by the least\r\ndeveloped countries is fully contained in the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted at the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.\r\nThe full and immediate implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action, therefore, remains crucial if the\r\nleast developed countries are to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment in their efforts to integrate into the world\r\neconomy.\r\nMy country believes that the developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed countries,\r\nshould fully benefit from the numerous opportunities\r\ncreated by the advent of the digital revolution.\r\nBridging the digital divide, therefore, should remain an\r\nurgent priority of the entire international community.\r\nMy country also believes that the active involvement of\r\nthe private sector and an innovative partnership with\r\nmajor international institutions in this process could\r\nprove to be a productive avenue that the international\r\ncommunity may wish to explore further.\r\nWe are also eagerly looking forward to the High-\r\nlevel International and Intergovernmental Event on\r\nFinancing for Development, to be held in Mexico early\r\nnext year. We hope that this event will provide the\r\ninternational community with an opportunity to agree\r\non new, innovative and additional ideas and strategies\r\nto mobilize funds for development.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): First of all, Sir, allow me to\r\ncongratulate you on your election as President of this\r\nimportant session. I am particularly pleased to see a\r\nfellow Asian presiding over the Assembly at the dawn\r\nof the new millennium. I am confident that with your\r\nbroad knowledge and experience and your able\r\nguidance, this session will bring forth fruitful results\r\nand inject a new dynamism into the work of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nI should like also to pay tribute to the outgoing\r\nPresident, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his vision and for his\r\nboundless energy in the cause of a better and more\r\neffective United Nations. Let me assure you also, Sir,\r\nof my delegation’s full support as you discharge your\r\ndaunting responsibilities.\r\nMy delegation would like to offer our deepest\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the Government and the\r\npeople of the United States for the tragic loss of life\r\nand property due to the horrendous and unspeakable\r\nacts of terrorism that took place on 11 September.\r\nThe delegation of the Union of Myanmar fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement made by the\r\nChairman of the Group of 77 and China, Ambassador\r\nAsadi, on this dialogue.\r\nA new partnership is needed for the international\r\ncommunity, particularly at this time of rapid\r\nglobalization. The nature of partnership in the twenty-\r\nfirst century has changed from relations between\r\nnations to a more complex relationship between\r\nsovereign entities, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, multinational corporations\r\nand academic institutions. This relationship has been\r\nfurther cemented by developments in communications\r\nand information technology. Time and space have\r\nbecome increasingly blurred as the people of the world\r\nincreasingly go on line. New forms of economic\r\nopportunities have emerged, such as electronic\r\ncommerce or mobile commerce, bringing new\r\nprosperity and a higher standard of living for many.\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nHowever, the majority of the people in the\r\ndeveloping countries have yet to benefit from the\r\nprocess of globalization. There is also a downside to\r\nglobalization, such as transnational crime, the\r\ntrafficking of women and children, the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, money\r\nlaundering, and so on  This, together with the growing\r\ndigital divide, has created frustration in the developing\r\ncountries, which face the danger of further\r\nmarginalization.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, it is time to reassess the\r\nentire system of international relations and to forge a\r\nnew partnership that will enable the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the world economy, so that\r\neveryone can enjoy the benefits of globalization.\r\nIt is our opinion that the present system of global\r\npartnership must be strengthened. The official\r\ndevelopment assistance initiatives and the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative have to\r\nsome extent been instrumental in bringing development\r\nto, and in relieving the debt burden in, the developing\r\ncountries. However, changing circumstances\r\nnecessitate that more, much more, be done in this\r\ndirection. Whatever we do, the new partnership should\r\nfocus on alleviating poverty and accelerating\r\ndevelopment. It must raise the standard of living of\r\npeoples the world over and enable them to enjoy\r\nsustainable development.\r\nAs I said, our first priority must be the alleviation\r\nof poverty. We must be mindful of the fact that two\r\nthirds of the world’s population is living under the\r\npoverty line. The prosperity of the world cannot not be\r\nmaintained amid a sea of hungry and destitute people.\r\nThis would threaten the long-term stability of the\r\nglobal economy. We must collectively implement the\r\ngoal of the Millennium Summit; that is, to reduce the\r\nincidence of poverty by half by the year 2015.\r\nWe must also bear in mind that poverty is not\r\nonly an economic problem, but also a social one. We\r\ncannot solve the problem merely through additional\r\nmonetary resources, although monetary resources are\r\nvery, very important. The problem must be addressed\r\nin a holistic manner. While addressing the plight of the\r\nurban poor, we must also direct our efforts to combat\r\npoverty in rural areas as well.\r\nIn forging a new partnership, special emphasis\r\nmust be placed on financing for development as a\r\nmajor vehicle in development cooperation. In the face\r\nof sluggish economic conditions and financial\r\nuncertainty, the international community should\r\ncollectively focus on this endeavour, which will not\r\nonly strengthen the effective mobilization of domestic\r\nresources but also reinforce the system of international\r\ncapital flows and derive maximum benefit from it.\r\nTrade is the major vehicle is bringing about\r\neconomic development. It helps foster interaction and\r\npartnership among nations. Market access and\r\nliberalization are necessary to fully enjoy the\r\npossibilities of trade. However, developing countries\r\nare still facing major obstacles in this regard. I cannot\r\nstress enough the importance of an open, rule-based,\r\ntransparent and non-discriminatory multilateral trading\r\nsystem. This will not only benefit international trade as\r\na whole but would also be most helpful in facilitating\r\ngrowth and development in developing countries. In\r\nthis context, the importance of promoting market\r\naccess for goods and services of interest to developing\r\ncountries must be specially stressed.\r\nInformation and communication technology has\r\nbecome increasingly important for the global economy.\r\nA knowledge-based economy holds promise, but also\r\nchallenges for the developing countries. If these\r\nchallenges can be overcome, information and\r\ncommunication technology is the most promising way\r\nof facilitating the integration of developing countries\r\ninto the mainstream of the global economy. It again\r\nrequires a new partnership — a partnership that will\r\nsupport the developing countries and help them to\r\nbridge the digital divide, so that they, too, can share in\r\nthe global prosperity resulting from the information\r\nand communication revolution.\r\nIn conclusion, let me express my hope that, in our\r\nendeavour to integrate the developing countries into\r\nthe world economy, we will see the effective operation\r\nof a new partnership of cooperation based on mutual\r\nrespect and understanding — a partnership for\r\ndevelopment through North-South cooperation as well\r\nas South-South cooperation.\r\nRegarding South-South cooperation, my\r\ndelegation reaffirms our commitment made at the\r\nSouth Summit, further strengthened by the consensus\r\nreached in Tehran, Iran, at the tenth session of the\r\nIntergovernmental Follow-up and Coordination\r\nCommittee on Economic Cooperation among\r\nDeveloping Countries.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nMr. Ortiz Gandarillas (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On behalf of my delegation and myself, I\r\nwish to convey cordial congratulations to you, Sir, on\r\npresiding over this meeting in the context of the high-\r\nlevel dialogue on financing international economic\r\ncooperation for development through partnership. I\r\nwish you success in your difficult tasks.\r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nconvey on behalf of the Government and the people of\r\nBolivia our most heartfelt condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of the United States, and\r\nour solidarity with them, after the terrorist attacks\r\nperpetrated on 11 September, while also categorically\r\nand vigorously condemning those criminal acts.\r\nI cannot fail to express my delegation’s concern\r\nat the fact that this meeting of enormous importance\r\nfor developing countries, including mine, is being held\r\nwithout the due participation of our ministers, who\r\nwould have made this a high-level political dialogue,\r\nthus guaranteeing better orientation and greater\r\nsuccess. I would also like to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Iran on behalf\r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWith regard to the matter before us, I would like\r\nto touch on a few points very briefly. First, I would like\r\nto mention the title of the theme of this dialogue,\r\n“Responding to globalization: facilitating the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy in the twenty-first century”. We would have\r\npreferred, for obvious reasons, to fix certain time\r\nframes and to have the title read instead “the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy in the first decade of the twenty-first\r\ncentury”. That would be the title if we had the\r\ndetermination to reach the objectives set at the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nWe believe that the mere attempt to integrate the\r\ndeveloping countries into the world economy should\r\nnot be an end in itself. We believe that such an\r\nintegration could, in the right conditions, be one of the\r\nbest mechanisms by which the developing countries\r\ncould improve and accelerate their development as part\r\nof a larger process of sustainable development.\r\nIn addition, the concept of facilitating the\r\nintegration of developing countries into the world\r\neconomy also means that the developed countries,\r\nwhich have the greatest influence in the world\r\neconomic system, must provide facilitation and\r\ncooperation to achieve this integration.\r\nWe believe that the current political, economic,\r\nfinancial, commercial and technological system is not\r\nresponding adequately to the needs of developing\r\ncountries in general, and in particular the least\r\ndeveloped countries, the heavily indebted poor\r\ncountries, small island countries and landlocked\r\ncountries.\r\nThe various diagnostic analyses carried out by\r\ninternational organisms and academic institutions\r\nreveal that there is an ever-growing gap between the\r\nliving conditions of developed countries and those of\r\ndeveloping countries. These enormous imbalances have\r\npersisted for a very long time and only aggravate the\r\nsituation of developing countries, with the exception of\r\na few countries that have been able to integrate into the\r\nnew currents of the globalization of the economy.\r\nThese same imbalances leave the vast majority of\r\ndeveloping countries faced with the danger of greater\r\nmarginalization, with the attendant political, economic,\r\nfinancial, commercial, social, technological and\r\nenvironmental consequences.\r\nFaced with this situation, we should ask ourselves\r\nwhat answer can be provided by the international\r\ncommunity, in particular by the developed countries,\r\nthe United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nother international and regional financial institutions,\r\nincluding private national and international capital\r\nfunds.\r\nUntil now, various responses have been tried out\r\nusing different models, concepts and programmes for\r\naction of all types, at the global, regional and national\r\nlevels. In this connection, I should mention the report\r\nof the High-level Panel created by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and headed by Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, former\r\nPresident of Mexico. The Panel’s report outlines a\r\nseries of recommendations and strategies for the\r\nmobilization of financial resources. Among other\r\nthings, it points out that the additional costs of\r\nachieving the objectives for the year 2015 will reach an\r\nannual total of $50 billion.\r\nThe realization of this imbalance has led to the\r\nemergence of parties advocating a change of the\r\ncurrent international economical, financial and trade\r\nsystem, though they have not so far reached concrete\r\nconclusions.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nWe believe that there is an accumulated store of\r\nknowledge and information about the problems that\r\ndeveloping countries face, but the vast majority of\r\nthese countries have so far not been able to overcome\r\ntheir severe limitations. Thus limited, and inadequately\r\nprepared, we are now faced with the phenomenon of\r\nglobalization, which presents new challenges, problems\r\nand dangers, but is also said to offer new opportunities.\r\nWe know that globalization has been driven by\r\nmarket forces, by technological advances and by\r\ntransnational corporations’ capacity for global\r\norganization and production. A new society of nations\r\nis being created. It is a more and more interdependent\r\nsociety, but it is also more dependent on private\r\ninternational capital, with all that that implies. For this\r\nreason, we subscribe to and second the statement by\r\nthe representative of the European Union on the need\r\nto humanize the phenomenon of globalization. As we\r\nsee it, the cooperation and solidarity of a more just and\r\nequitable international community must place\r\nglobalization at the service of human beings.\r\nOne should ask now how to respond\r\nappropriately to the phenomenon of globalization and\r\nthe integration of developing countries in that process.\r\nThis dialogue will allow us to formulate some\r\nresponses leading to decisions on specific and practical\r\naction. In that context, it would perhaps be valuable to\r\nexplore once more the possibility of building bridges\r\nenabling the gradual but accelerating progress of\r\ndeveloping countries so that they could become\r\nintegrated into the world economy through a fair and\r\njust process.\r\nAs we see it, those bridges should be built in\r\nseveral areas. In the political field, it is essential to\r\nstrengthen democracy and respect for human, social,\r\ncultural and political rights.\r\nWith regard to economics, it is essential to build\r\nbridges to transform the production capacity of\r\ndeveloping countries, especially of the least developed\r\ncountries, small island countries and landlocked\r\ncountries, by strengthening their infrastructure in\r\ntransportation and production.\r\nIn the financial area, it is essential to build\r\nbridges to ensure that developing countries, and highly\r\nindebted poor countries in particular, have access to\r\nnew and additional financial resources on a\r\nconcessionary basis and in sufficient amounts to\r\npromote their economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWith regard to trade, bridges should be built once\r\nand for all to allow the export products of developing\r\ncountries free access to the large consumer markets of\r\ndeveloped countries. We suggest that that process\r\nshould include expansion of the developed countries’\r\ninitiative to allow free access to the products of less\r\ndeveloped countries so that it includes the highly\r\nindebted poor countries.\r\nIn the technological field, bridges should be built\r\nto enable better utilization and adaptation of the most\r\nadvanced technologies so that agricultural, textile and\r\nmanufactured goods will be more competitive in\r\ninternational markets.\r\nIn the social sphere, bridges should be built to\r\neradicate poverty, safeguard health and improve\r\neducation — professional, technical and academic— so\r\nas to make human resources able to function in a\r\nhighly competitive world, while ensuring peaceful\r\ncoexistence in an atmosphere of tolerance, respect and\r\nsolidarity among human beings.\r\nIt is also essential to build bridges to create and\r\nstrengthen the national, regional and global institutions\r\nnecessary to build an institutional legal framework that\r\nwill make possible the changes needed to make and\r\nmeet new commitments. It is clear that the equitable\r\nparticipation of developing countries is essential in that\r\nnew exercise.\r\nWe must now ask who the builders of those\r\nbridges will be. We could say that that responsibility\r\nbelongs to everyone. But the primary responsibility for\r\ntransforming the current global system into one that\r\ncan rise to the new challenges and demands of\r\nglobalization and, above all, foster the development of\r\ndeveloping countries falls on those who currently have\r\nthe greatest influence in the direction and functioning\r\nof the prevailing system.\r\nWe ask that these suggestions be taken into\r\naccount in your report, Mr. President, and conclude by\r\ncalling on the entire international community to form a\r\nnew alliance on the basis of a new ethic with a vision\r\nof a world of greater solidarity, equality, justice and\r\nhumanity for all, and not just for the few.\r\nMr. Apata (Nigeria): On behalf of the Nigerian\r\ndelegation, I wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nfifty-sixth session. We assure you and the other\r\nmembers of the Bureau of the support of the Nigerian\r\ndelegation in ensuring that at this session the Assembly\r\nsuccessfully attains the objectives we have set for it.\r\nOnce again I wish to express to the Government\r\nand people of the United States the condolences of the\r\nGovernment and people of Nigeria over the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September and the loss of invaluable lives\r\nand property. Nigeria reiterates its pledge to cooperate\r\nwith members of the international community to\r\nfashion appropriate measures to combat all forms of\r\nterrorism.\r\nNigeria fully aligns itself with the statement made\r\nyesterday by the representative of Iran on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China on the theme of the dialogue\r\nthat we are now debating.\r\nAs the medium for the rapid integration of\r\ncountries through trade, financial flows and\r\ninformation and communications technologies,\r\nglobalization has remained the one crucial phenomenon\r\nand process that holds great promise for all nations. Yet\r\nit poses tremendous challenges, including the risk of\r\nmarginalizing a large section of the world’s population.\r\nWhile the developed countries are at the forefront of\r\nthe process of globalization, thereby reaping its\r\nbenefits, developing countries are still at the margins\r\nbecause of various obstacles and challenges.\r\nIt is our conviction that the central role of the\r\nUnited Nations places it in a unique position to ensure\r\nthat the benefits of globalization are evenly spread and\r\nshared within and among all countries, leading to\r\npeople-centred socio-economic development and\r\ngrowth, including poverty eradication. It is therefore\r\nmost appropriate that this dialogue and the forthcoming\r\nmajor summits and conferences should focus on the\r\nbest ways to integrate the economies of developing\r\ncountries into the global economy in a manner that will\r\nmake the international economic system equitable and\r\nfair.\r\nThe trend across the globe so far has amply\r\ndemonstrated that individual countries recognize that it\r\nis their primary responsibility to have their economies\r\nintegrated into the world economy. They equally\r\nrealize that regional integration will facilitate the\r\nintegration of their economies into the global economy.\r\nThe European Union is a good example in this regard.\r\nOver two thirds of Europe’s exports and imports now\r\nconsist of intra-West European exchanges, compared\r\nwith a lesser proportion two decades ago. In relative\r\nterms, Europe’s trade with the rest of world, especially\r\nAfrican countries, has been on the decline. Foreign\r\ndirect investment has also been very much within\r\nEurope; over time, no less than 60 per cent of the\r\noverall foreign direct investment flows of Western\r\nEurope have remained there.\r\nGlobalization has created in its wake tremendous\r\nopportunities, particularly in accelerating trade and\r\ninvestment flows within and across borders. This\r\nphenomenon was largely responsible for the high\r\ngrowth rate and unprecedented wealth of the 1990s.\r\nHowever, the benefits of such wealth have continued to\r\nbe unevenly spread. While the industrialized\r\neconomies of Europe and America have prospered, the\r\nmajority of developing countries have grown in\r\npoverty. The Economic Commission for Africa\r\nestimates that 44 per cent of the African population\r\nlives below the level of extreme poverty. The estimate\r\nfor sub-Saharan Africa is a depressing 59 per cent.\r\nThe situation has become very critical for most\r\ndeveloping countries, which are spending more on debt\r\nservicing than on health, education and much needed\r\ninfrastructure. The fact that 48 least developed\r\ncountries’ share of world exports is currently 0.4 per\r\ncent, as against 0.6 per cent in the 1980s, derogates\r\nfrom the much published benefits of globalization.\r\nSimilarly, the least developed countries’ share of\r\nforeign direct investment is currently 0.4 per cent. The\r\nshare of African countries in overall foreign direct\r\ninvestment flows is 1.2 per cent, even after recording a\r\n20 per cent increase in 2000.\r\nCapital flows have tended to remain highly\r\nconcentrated among developed countries and a few\r\ndeveloping countries. In 1998 about 10 countries of the\r\nSouth accounted for 70 per cent of foreign direct\r\ninvestment flows to developing countries. Although\r\nAsia has fared better, the 1997 financial crisis in that\r\nregion showed the impact of globalization, which\r\ncreated serious financial instability and destabilized\r\nmost of their economies. The balance sheet for Latin\r\nAmerican and the Caribbean region, despite massive\r\nreform measures, shows more liabilities than benefits.\r\nThe dependence of African countries on primary\r\ncommodities, coupled with a weak productive base and\r\nstrong supply-side constraints, small population and\r\nweak domestic markets, declining world prices, lack of\r\nmarket access and the increasing scourge of\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nHIV/AIDS, will further delay the integration of African\r\neconomies into the global economy unless concerted\r\nefforts are deliberately launched to accelerate the\r\neconomic and social development of African States.\r\nSuch concerted efforts are necessary in support of the\r\ncomprehensive reforms being undertaken on the\r\ncontinent through increasingly determined\r\ncommitments of African leaders to democratic\r\ngovernance.\r\nThe integration of developing countries,\r\nespecially in Africa, into the world economy requires\r\nthat actions be taken at the country, regional and global\r\nlevels. At the national level, efforts should be made to\r\nestablish safety nets to address poverty and to cushion\r\nthe drastic effects of economic reforms. While\r\nliberalization and deregulation facilitate private sector\r\ninvolvement, the State must continuously invest in the\r\nsocial sectors, such as education and health, while\r\nproviding incentives that would attract the participation\r\nof the private sector. Such public-private partnership\r\nwill strongly enhance national capacity and facilitate\r\nregional and, later, global integration.\r\nIt is obvious that regional integration offers\r\ndeveloping countries a realistic opportunity to pool\r\ntheir resources for development within their region.\r\nThe regional concept enlarges the economic space of\r\ndeveloping countries and consolidates the reform\r\nprocesses. For Africa, this requires the effective\r\nlinkage and integration of its physical infrastructures,\r\ntrade liberalization, the harmonization of financial and\r\nmonetary systems and private sector involvement. It\r\nmust extend to regional transport, power and\r\ncommunication, education, conflict resolution,\r\nreconstruction and peace-building. To achieve these\r\nrequires a huge inflow of financial resources, which\r\nAfrica on its own, with the most vulnerable economies\r\nin the world, does not have.\r\nNigeria and other countries of the West African\r\nsubregion have expanded the process of their\r\nintegration to include macroeconomic coordination,\r\nfinancial cooperation and physical infrastructure, as\r\nwell as environment. The countries of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States have made\r\nconsiderable efforts to introduce measures to\r\nharmonize trade and custom laws. They are\r\nincreasingly facilitating cross-border trade.\r\nNigeria, on its part, has established a one-stop-\r\nshop to effect investment through the National\r\nInvestment Promotion Council, whereby bureaucratic\r\ndifficulties have been significantly reduced for\r\ninvestors. The private and public sectors partnership\r\nhas been intensified. We continue to address the issue\r\nof physical infrastructure, particularly in the area of\r\ninformation and communication technology, to create\r\nan enabling environment for foreign investments. It\r\nmust be mentioned, however, that in spite of these huge\r\nefforts on our part, the responses in terms of foreign\r\ndirect investment have been minuscule. We therefore\r\nurge the international community to match these\r\nreform measures and market-oriented programmes of\r\nthe countries of the South with concrete action.\r\nAs observed earlier, all nations have come to\r\nbelieve in regionalization or regional integration as a\r\nvital prelude to globalization. It is in this light that the\r\nNew African Initiative was recently launched in\r\nLusaka, Zambia, by African leaders. That forward-\r\nlooking Initiative, designed by African leaders\r\nthemselves for an accountable overall governance of\r\nthe continent for the socio-economic upliftment of its\r\npeople, represents their wisdom and desire to integrate\r\nthe continent into the global economy. That Initiative\r\ncalls for international support and partnership for\r\nsuccess, for Africa cannot do it all alone.\r\nSo much has been emphasized about the benefits\r\nof information and communication technologies. We\r\nwelcome these benefits, particularly in facilitating\r\ncommunication among the peoples of the world.\r\nNevertheless, we should start focusing on how we can\r\nminimize the dangers that can bring untold hardship\r\nand disaster, posed by those who purposely set out to\r\ndisrupt the effective functioning of the world’s\r\ncommunication systems, particularly cyberspace. The\r\ntime has come for us at the United Nations to begin the\r\nprocess of discussing measures to combat those who\r\nwill exploit the World Wide Web for negative motives\r\nand activities. We should not wait until the world\r\nfinancial system, for example, is disrupted before we\r\ncommence our discussion. Such disruption will not\r\nrespect poor or rich nations or North or South. This\r\nissue therefore deserves urgent consideration in our\r\ncollective endeavour for a stronger international\r\neconomic cooperation for development.\r\nNigeria and, indeed, all African countries have\r\nconsistently emphasized that the first act of\r\ncontributing to African economic renaissance is for the\r\ncreditor nations to cancel Africa’s external debt. To\r\nhave Africa contribute over two thirds of its gross\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nnational product to service external debt is to consign\r\nthe continent permanently into poverty. We all know\r\nthat poverty is the greatest obstacle to the integration\r\nof African economies into the global economy. World\r\nleaders entered into a commitment in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration when they pledged to take appropriate\r\nmeasures, including cancellation, to address Africa’s\r\nindebtedness. This commitment was given a year ago.\r\nWe are yet to see any concrete measures in this\r\ndirection. We therefore call on the creditor nations to\r\ntake another look at the Millennium Declaration and to\r\nbegin the process of fundamentally addressing Africa’s\r\nexternal indebtedness.\r\nIn conclusion, the discussion of the ways and\r\nmeans of facilitating the integration of the developing\r\ncountries into the global economy in this century of\r\nnecessity requires a holistic and multidimensional\r\napproach, focusing concerns on ensuring an open,\r\nrules-based, transparent multilateral trading system and\r\ninternational monetary and financial regime involving\r\nthe greater participation of developing countries in\r\ndecision-making. Such deliberations should involve all\r\nrelevant stakeholders, including the private sector.\r\nBecause globalization should be an inclusive and not\r\nan exclusive process, so should its benefits, which\r\nshould reach out and affect all of mankind positively.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate at the high-level dialogue.\r\nI now call on the representative of Paraguay,\r\nRapporteur of the first ministerial round table-cum-\r\ninformal panel, to present his summary.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nhave the honour of presenting my summary as\r\nRapporteur of the round table-cum-informal panel on\r\nthe question of enhancing the integration of developing\r\ncountries in the emerging global information network,\r\nfacilitating access to information and communication\r\ntechnologies for developing countries.\r\nIn spite of the tragic events of 11 September, the\r\nstrong spirit of cooperation and solidarity in the\r\ninternational community has been reflected in open,\r\nactive and interesting debate in the round table-cum-\r\ninformal panel on enhancing the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries in the emerging global\r\ninformation network, facilitating access to information\r\nand communication technologies for developing\r\ncountries. The tragedy of last week has painfully\r\nreminded us of the opportunities and risks involved in\r\nour interconnected world. It has highlighted the need to\r\nensure that technology is not used against humanity but\r\nfor the benefit of all.\r\nThe discussion, with the help of the input from\r\nthe distinguished panellists, resulted in a fruitful\r\nexchange of views and ideas on what needs to be done\r\nto ensure that information and communication\r\ntechnology (ICT) serves as a tool for development.\r\nFollowing are the salient points of the discussion.\r\nToday, globalization is driven by ICTs that\r\nexpedite the flow of information across national\r\nboundaries. Advances in technology and improved\r\naccessibility through lower costs and increased user-\r\nfriendliness have resulted in new opportunities for\r\npromoting development through greater access to\r\nmarkets and better access to knowledge in the areas\r\nsuch as health and human resource development. ICT\r\npolicies must be considered in the broader context of\r\ndevelopment and addressed within the context of a\r\ncomprehensive, holistic approach. ICT cannot be seen\r\nas a panacea for all development problems and\r\nchallenges.\r\nThe challenges and limitations in bridging the\r\ndigital divide, particularly for developing countries,\r\nremain enormous. The lack of infrastructure,\r\ninadequate regulatory environment, high cost of access\r\nand lack of human resources remain serious restrictions\r\non the promotion of accessibility and connectivity in\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in rural areas. In this\r\nregard, the problem of infrastructure could be\r\novercome through the adoption of relevant technology,\r\nlowering costs, the collective use of facilities and the\r\ncreation of a favourable environment for ICT-related\r\ninvestment. With regard to human resources, the issue\r\nof brain drain — which can also be seen as a\r\nmechanism for technology transfer — needs to be\r\nfurther addressed. Several speakers stressed the\r\ndiversity of the situation in developing countries as\r\nregards ICT, and expressed their opinion that for ICT\r\nto become really significant, basic needs such as\r\neducation and health must be addressed on a priority\r\nbasis. A more comprehensive approach that integrates\r\nICT into a new development paradigm is needed.\r\nThe gender aspect must be addressed in the\r\ncontext of ICT and development, given that the impact\r\nof ICT is not gender-neutral. It is important to ensure\r\nthat women have equal access to the infrastructure,\r\neducation and training related to ICT, and that new\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nmodes of working made available by ICT, such as\r\nteleworking, are explored with a view to enable new\r\npossibilities, particularly for women.\r\nDevelopment of local content remains a great\r\nchallenge, not only in terms of language but also in the\r\nsocial, historical and cultural context. It is important to\r\nrespect social and technical pluralities and to avoid a\r\n“one size fits all” approach in identifying effective\r\nentry points for developing countries into the\r\nglobalized digital economy.\r\nOther developing countries could examine the\r\npossibility of replicating the success of low-wage\r\ncountries in taking advantage of the information-\r\nprocessing work outsourced by transnational\r\ncompanies.\r\nThe role of the state is vital in creating an\r\nenabling environment for a knowledge-based economy,\r\nin particular in establishing an appropriate regulatory\r\nenvironment, as well as in ensuring affordable access\r\nto ICT for those who cannot register their needs and\r\npreferences adequately through the market mechanism.\r\nICT has a potential to reduce inequalities on\r\nnational and international levels with the collaboration\r\nand genuine partnership among all stakeholders —\r\npolicy makers, non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) and the private sector. The example of\r\nMozambique as presented by one of the panellists\r\nillustrated the importance of cooperation at the national\r\nlevel among stakeholders in formulating and\r\nimplementing national ICT strategies for development.\r\nThe involvement of NGOs could help ensure that\r\nthe developing countries acquire technologies that are\r\nrelevant to the needs of the target beneficiaries.\r\nCooperation with academics and professionals in the\r\nfields of social science, science and technology is\r\nnecessary to ensure that research and development in\r\nICT are adapted to meet the requirements and the\r\nresource base of developing countries.\r\nWhile the issue of the digital divide had been\r\naddressed by the International Telecommunication\r\nUnion (ITU) since the mid-1980s, the United Nations\r\nas a whole started its efforts in the 1990s. In general,\r\ndeveloping countries have made significant progress in\r\nthe ICT area. But the least developed countries and\r\nAfrica have been left behind. Regional and\r\ninternational efforts should be supported and further\r\nencouraged to ensure that the digital divide does not\r\nwiden. The United Nations must play a critical role in\r\npromoting coherence and cooperation at the\r\ninternational level. Many speakers voiced their hopes\r\nthat the ICT Task Force, created by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, will make a tangible difference for people on\r\nthe ground through its efforts to bridge the digital\r\ndivide on the basis of facilitating partnerships among\r\ngovernments, NGOs, the private sector and the\r\ninternational community. In this regard, a proposal was\r\nmade for the establishment of an ICT trust fund to\r\nsupport these activities.\r\nSeveral speakers underscored the need to view\r\naffordable access to information and knowledge as a\r\nfundamental human right.\r\nThe President: I call now on His Excellency\r\nMr. Ion Botnaru of the Republic of Moldova,\r\nRapporteur of the second ministerial round-table-cum-\r\ninformal panel, to present his summary of the panel’s\r\nactivities.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Moldova), Rapporteur of the\r\nsecond ministerial round-table-cum-informal panel:\r\nThe second ministerial round-table-cum-informal panel\r\nhad a very comprehensive and productive discussion\r\non the topic of “Promoting the integration of\r\ndeveloping countries into the world economy and\r\ngenerating new public and private financing resources\r\nto complement development efforts”.\r\nIntroductory statements by the panellists\r\nfacilitated a fruitful exchange of views, ideas and\r\nconsiderations on a number of aspects of financing\r\ndevelopment. They focused on those elements put\r\nforward in the context of the ongoing process towards\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, scheduled to take place in March 2002 at\r\nMonterrey, Mexico. On the basis of the facilitator’s\r\ntext, all efforts should now be aimed at reaching\r\nconsensus and at identifying practical steps to increase\r\nfinancing resources.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September highlighted the\r\ndegree of interdependence in the international\r\ncommunity, as they showed that someone else’s\r\npoverty very soon becomes one’s own problem and can\r\nresult in fanaticism and terrorism. The meeting\r\nstrongly underscored the need not to let those events\r\nundermine the process of financing for development. In\r\nthe common commitment to fight terrorism,\r\ncooperation in areas such as money-laundering, tax\r\nshelters and offshore banking is critical.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nThe financing for development process provides\r\nan opportunity to answer the open question of how to\r\nfinance the public policy interventions called for in the\r\ncomprehensive development agenda developed by the\r\nUnited Nations in the 1990s through the various global\r\nconferences. At the same time, it is an opportunity for\r\njoining the larger development debate with that on\r\nreform of the international financial architecture.\r\nAchievement by developing countries of the\r\ninternational development goals adopted at the\r\nMillennium Summit and the related need for increased\r\naid from donor countries are additional priorities. In\r\norder to preserve the credibility of the international\r\ncommunity, it is essential for the process of financing\r\nfor development to go beyond already-existing\r\nagreements. Speakers noted the unprecedented level of\r\ncooperation among the entities of the United Nations\r\nsystem, in particular the World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, in\r\npreparing for the International Conference. The process\r\nis also unique in engaging all stakeholders, including\r\nthe private sector.\r\nA number of reasons were suggested for why\r\nofficial resource transfers were needed within the\r\nprocess of financing for development. A clearer picture\r\nof the extent, type and quantity of existing flows and\r\ntheir use for productive purposes should be sought.\r\nSince global financial crises remain a threat to the task\r\nof promoting development, coordinated action is\r\nneeded in the short term to reduce the risk of crisis, and\r\nto respond to any such crisis. Great progress has been\r\nmade in recent years in improving financial\r\ninfrastructures, especially at the national level.\r\nHowever, much still needs to be done on broader\r\ninstitutional reform.\r\nSpeakers acknowledged the need to find ways to\r\ninvolve the private sector in financial crisis\r\nmanagement, as well as the difficulties in doing so.\r\nLong-term aspects, such as macro-economic\r\ninterdependence and potential contagion effects, also\r\nneed to be addressed. Rapid developments in the global\r\neconomy have led to a democratic deficit in economic\r\ngovernance structures; new rules and institutions are\r\nthus required. In particular, participation by developing\r\ncountries in international decision-making processes\r\nneeds to be enhanced. While some progress has been\r\nmade in that regard, including at meetings of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and at consultations between the\r\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment and emerging economies, further steps\r\nare needed. The High-level Panel on Financing for\r\nDevelopment — the Zedillo Panel — has proposed the\r\ncreation of an apex institution to address economic\r\npolarization and economic insecurity.\r\nThe financing for development process has\r\nhighlighted the need and prepared the ground for a\r\nrenewed commitment to increased international\r\ncooperation to improve financing for development\r\nopportunities. Speakers discussed proposals for\r\ncollecting an international tax, such as a currency\r\ntransaction tax — known as a Tobin tax — or a carbon\r\ntax on the consumption of fossil fuel, as recommended\r\nin the Zedillo report (A/55/1000). In addition, the\r\npossibility of creating an international tax organization\r\ndirected to fiscal harmonization and cooperation was\r\nmentioned.\r\nSpeakers also highlighted the impact of trade on\r\nfinancing for development. The trade dimension is\r\nrightly included in the financing for development\r\nprocess, and it is deemed to be of particular importance\r\nto move forward in the context of the forthcoming\r\nministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization, to\r\nbe held at Doha.\r\nOfficial development assistance remains an\r\nimportant issue for discussion in the financing for\r\ndevelopment process, including the quantity and\r\nquality of aid, clarity about sectors in which to invest\r\naid, and a more efficient use of aid by recipient\r\ncountries. With respect to official development\r\nassistance, the Zedillo Panel endorsed the common-\r\npool proposal, which aims at curbing the increasingly\r\nunmanageable transaction costs involved in receiving\r\naid. National ownership of development strategies\r\nshould take priority over donor conditionality, and the\r\nnew African initiative already reflects such an\r\napproach. Public-private partnerships, such as\r\nchannelling aid through non-governmental\r\norganizations, were also presented as an example of\r\nhow to lower transaction costs and increase returns.\r\nThe efficiency of current debt-relief mechanisms\r\nwas discussed. There is a need to go beyond the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative and to put in place a more transparent and\r\nfair system. Debt sustainability is an important\r\nobjective, as debt relief has to insure a real transfer of\r\nresources to indebted countries for poverty reduction.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nThe role of the State and the issue of governance\r\nwere also discussed. Notwithstanding the increasing\r\nrole of many actors and stakeholders in development\r\nand the discussion concerning the role of the State, a\r\nnumber of areas continue to be the responsibility of the\r\npublic sector, such as the provision of public goods,\r\nsocial services and the prevention and management of\r\ncrises. Thus, a mixture of public-sector and private-\r\nsector action was called for.\r\nWith regard to mobilizing domestic resources for\r\ndevelopment in developing countries, a number of\r\nproposals were mentioned. The Zedillo Panel, for\r\nexample, pointed to the value of funded, defined-\r\ncontribution pension schemes in increasing savings;\r\nthese could be managed in the public or the private\r\nsector.\r\nThe financing for development process also needs\r\nto take into account various dimensions of the situation\r\nin countries in need. For example, conflicts and\r\ndisasters have led to decapitalization in countries\r\nwhere human and financial capital has been destroyed.\r\nRecapitalizing credit institutions is an important\r\nendeavour to ensure availability of resources in post-\r\nconflict and other countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs for its\r\nefforts to help the event take place. My special thanks\r\ngo to the panelists, and especially to the Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs,\r\nMr. Nitin Desai, whose personal active participation in\r\nthe event made it so successful. I would like also to\r\nthank my colleague, the Permanent Representative of\r\nSouth Africa, Ambassador Kumalo, for the very\r\neffective manner in which he chaired that important\r\nevent.\r\nThe President: I extend my appreciation to all\r\nrepresentatives, whose outstanding efforts have\r\nresulted in a successful dialogue despite the\r\nrescheduling of major meetings of the General\r\nAssembly. I believe that this is a clear manifestation of\r\nour strong unity and solidarity in the pursuit of world\r\npeace and development.\r\nAs we are all so sadly aware, this dialogue was\r\nheld against the backdrop of the 11 September terrorist\r\nattacks on our host country. Those heinous actions\r\nserve as a stark reminder that international terrorism\r\nconstitutes a grave and deadly threat to peace and\r\ndemocracy. In this regard, great efforts in the context\r\nof broader multilateral cooperation are called for to\r\ncombat international terrorism in all its forms.\r\nThe plenary debate provided a unique opportunity\r\nfor highly productive discussions on the international\r\neconomic environment from different perspectives. The\r\ndialogue was particularly timely in the context of the\r\ncurrent global economic slowdown, enabling us to\r\nmake major progress in defining a new development\r\nstrategy. It is a demanding task to do justice to the wide\r\nrange of views and the wealth of ideas submitted in\r\nthese plenary meetings. I will therefore prepare a\r\ndetailed summary, in close consultation with\r\ndelegations, and circulate it at a later stage.\r\nAt this point, I wish to make some observations\r\nand underscore main issues.\r\nThe view was expressed that dialogue could give\r\nuseful input into upcoming major conferences, which\r\ninclude the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nMinisterial Meeting to be held in Doha, Qatar, the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, to be held in Monterrey, Mexico, and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, to be held\r\nin Johannesburg, South Africa. It was also felt that the\r\ndialogue could be viewed as an opportunity to define a\r\nstrategy to follow up the Millennium Declaration.\r\nGlobalization was widely seen as a reality that we\r\nmust accept. While it could be a formidable multiplier\r\nof growth and prosperity, it also risks widening\r\ninequalities and disparities within and among\r\ncountries. Emphasis was placed on the importance of\r\npolicy choice in order to reap the full benefits of\r\nglobalization, which is an interactive and\r\ncomprehensive process. There was also stress on the\r\nimportance of humanizing globalization so as to assist\r\ndeveloping countries to become smoothly integrated\r\ninto the world economy by opening world markets and\r\ngenerating new flows of financing for development.\r\nRepresentatives underscored the unique role of\r\nthe United Nations in providing the normative policy\r\nframework for addressing challenges involved in\r\nglobalization. This view is based on the belief that the\r\nUnited Nations is also best suited for bringing all\r\nstakeholders together in a partnership for sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWith regard to sub-theme (a), on financing for\r\ndevelopment, the multitude of goals for development\r\nand poverty eradication set out in the Millennium\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\nDeclaration were recognized as the framework for\r\ninternational development cooperation. It was agreed\r\nthat a favourable international economic environment\r\nis crucial for mobilizing financial resources. Attention\r\nwas also called to the need for improving governance\r\nat the national level and for creating an environment\r\nconducive to investment, both domestic and foreign.\r\nPrivate capital flows are particularly important for\r\nincreasing productive capacity and the development of\r\ninfrastructure.\r\nConcerns were expressed about the volatility of\r\nshort-term capital flows, including Southern capital\r\nflight, and representatives called for an appropriate\r\nmechanism to deal with them. It was agreed that the\r\nupcoming International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in Monterrey represented an invaluable\r\nopportunity to promote significant improvements in the\r\ngrowth and development prospects of developing\r\ncountries.\r\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) remains\r\nan important source of development funding for some\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly the least developed\r\nones. There was broad agreement on the need to\r\nreverse the decline of ODA levels and move towards\r\nachieving an ODA expenditure target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross national product. Promoting the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of aid was also emphasized, as was the need\r\nto create social safety nets. The view was expressed\r\nthat vulnerability, as well as low per capita income,\r\nshould be considered by donors in assessing needs,\r\nparticularly of the least developed countries and\r\nsmaller developing States in Africa. The need was\r\nreiterated for deeper, broader and expeditious debt\r\nrelief in the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC)\r\nand beyond, and for effective and coherent debt\r\npolicies, including post-HIPC programmes.\r\nRepresentatives have high expectations that the\r\nupcoming WTO meeting in Qatar will provide a\r\nrenewed opportunity to focus on market excess,\r\ncapacity-building and trade and growing protectionism\r\nduring the global economic slowdown. It was stressed\r\nthat coherence in global policies on development\r\nassistance, debt relief and trade should be enhanced in\r\norder to increase the effectiveness of each of these\r\npolicy elements. Attention was drawn to the need for\r\nimproving governance of the global economy and\r\nfinancial system and for enhanced dialogue of all\r\nrelevant stakeholders for greater policy coherence.\r\nThose stakeholders include Governments, the United\r\nNations, the Bretton Woods institutions, the WTO, the\r\nprivate sector and civil society.\r\nWith regard to sub-theme (b), on information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICT) for development,\r\nrepresentatives concurred on the view that information\r\nand communication technologies could play a pivotal\r\nrole in economic and social development. They further\r\nnoted that the ICT revolution has led to the creation of\r\nthe emerging global knowledge-based economy, which\r\nin turn has opened up vast opportunities for economic\r\ngrowth and social development. However, this\r\ninformation revolution presents many challenges and\r\nrisks. Much of the world continues to live in poverty.\r\nMany countries have yet to reap the benefits of the ICT\r\nrevolution because of lack of ICT infrastructure,\r\nincluding electricity, and also because of high rates of\r\nilliteracy.\r\nIn this regard, concern was expressed about the\r\nwidening digital divide. It was felt that narrowing the\r\ndigital divide was a priority, requiring bold policies to\r\ndevelop human resources and the institutional capacity\r\nto manage such changes. Comprehensive national\r\naction was viewed as a prerequisite for establishing the\r\nnecessary capacities and infrastructure to successfully\r\nreap the benefits of ICT. Strong support for such\r\nprogrammes by international and multilateral\r\ninstitutions, particularly the United Nations system,\r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions as well as\r\nregional banks and others, was seen as vital.\r\nIn addition, representatives highlighted the\r\nimportance of forging partnerships between the public\r\nand private sectors. Thus the establishment of the ICT\r\nTask Force was welcomed, and it was hoped that its\r\nactivities would provide tangible results. It was agreed\r\nthat the benefits of ICT must be harnessed and directed\r\ntowards the long-term comprehensive development of\r\ndeveloping countries so as to ensure their eventual\r\nsuccessful integration into the global economy.\r\nIn order to achieve this, developing countries\r\nwere called upon to provide an environment that would\r\nattract investment in ICT infrastructure, as well as to\r\ndevise policies to increase local content. Only in this\r\nway, it was felt, would developing countries be able to\r\nmake needed progress towards sustained economic\r\ngrowth, as well as improvements in the areas of health,\r\neducation and poverty eradication. Given the diverse\r\nconditions and policy objectives, there was recognition\r\nof the unique role of the United Nations in the\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.6\r\npromotion of public awareness of the wider\r\napplications of ICT for development and poverty\r\neradication.\r\nThe decision of the International\r\nTelecommunication Union to hold the World Summit\r\non the Information Society was welcomed, and it was\r\nhoped that the General Assembly would explore ways\r\nto contribute to the successful preparation of the\r\nSummit. Views were also expressed that policies\r\nshould be devised to cope with the rising instance of\r\ncyber crimes and other associated illegal activities.\r\nThose are some initial observations on the two-\r\nday dialogue. As I mentioned at the beginning, a more\r\ndetailed summary of these meetings will be issued as a\r\ndocument to the General Assembly.\r\nThe two-day high-level dialogue on strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation for development\r\nthrough partnership is now concluded.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15.p.m.\r\n"
