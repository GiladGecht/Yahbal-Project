Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n01-54745 (E)\r\n*0154745*\r\nPresident: Mr. Han Seung-soo . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Republic of Korea)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/56/1 and Corr.1 and Add.1)\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): As I am taking the floor for the\r\nfirst time at this fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to express the satisfaction of my\r\ndelegation at seeing you, Mr. President, at the helm of\r\nour proceedings, and to assure you of the full\r\ncooperation of Italy in the exercise of your high\r\nfunctions.\r\nThe annual report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nactivities of the Organization traditionally sets the tone\r\nfor the work of the General Assembly. It provides us\r\nwith an authoritative opportunity to address unsettled\r\nquestions from the previous session and urgent new\r\nmatters that have emerged since.\r\nThis is especially true today, when the General\r\nAssembly finds itself deliberating under the pressures\r\ncreated by the events of 11 September, which took an\r\nunfathomable toll in human life and material damage.\r\nThe target of that monstrous crime was the city that\r\nhosts the United Nations and has become synonymous\r\nwith it. In this context, the attacks, which disrupted our\r\nnormal programme of work, were also directed against\r\nthe United Nations, inflicting a grievous injury to the\r\nrespect owed this universal forum and causing grave\r\noffence to all of our countries.\r\nThese events must be accounted for in the work\r\nof the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly and\r\nin the assessment and future set-up of the\r\nOrganization’s activity, and a special debate has been\r\ncalled for on measures to combat international\r\nterrorism, which is scheduled to begin on 1 October.\r\nAgainst this background, the traditional format of\r\nthe report (A/56/1), which is subdivided according to\r\nthe four main operative sectors of the United Nations,\r\nthis year seems more appropriate than ever. In fact, the\r\ncontinued pursuit of related objectives, and their\r\nprompt and far-reaching realization, seems to represent\r\nthe principal means of eliminating the root causes of\r\nthe new, indiscriminate threat represented by\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nFor the period in question, the report describes\r\nsignificant progress by the United Nations in the field\r\nof peace and security. Steps forward have undoubtedly\r\nbeen taken in enacting the types of reform in\r\npeacekeeping operations embraced by the Brahimi\r\nreport. Italy wholeheartedly supports the growing focus\r\non conflict prevention and feels that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations in last June’s report should\r\nbe fully implemented by Member States and the main\r\norgans of the United Nations.\r\nPrevention, conflict resolution and reconstruction\r\nare three elements of a continuous process and cannot\r\nbe addressed separately: an integrated approach should\r\npermeate the Organization’s culture of peace. The\r\nSecretary-General’s report reflects this sentiment in the\r\nclose connection it forges between peacekeeping and\r\n2\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\npeace-building actions. There is a growing need for a\r\ncomprehensive vision and coordination between the\r\nvarious phases of the response to a conflict situation.\r\nEven the mandates of operations authorized by the\r\nSecurity Council should, as a matter of course,\r\ncontemplate not just an exit strategy for the\r\npeacekeeping forces deployed, but also a range of\r\nactivities for reconstruction and the reintegration and\r\nresettlement of former combatants, as well as\r\ninstitution-building in the country concerned.\r\nThis imperative need, which is now generally\r\nrecognized, should promote more effective\r\ncoordination among the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, as\r\nwell as between them and the Secretariat and\r\nspecialized agencies, funds and programmes. To this\r\nend, the spread of an integrated and multidimensional\r\nculture among the personnel of the Secretariat,\r\nagencies, funds and programmes should be actively\r\npromoted through the Administrative Committee on\r\nCoordination, fully utilizing the potential of the United\r\nNations System Staff College in Turin.\r\nThe report’s in-depth analysis on the\r\nimplementation of commitments in the humanitarian\r\nsector reflects the Organization’s ongoing commitment\r\nto this area, despite insufficient financial resources.\r\nConflict, crisis situations and natural catastrophes are\r\nall dramatic realities, whose lowest common\r\ndenominator is the suffering they cause civilian\r\npopulations.\r\nHumanitarian assistance is one of the most\r\nimportant sectors. Italy’s cooperation activity in this\r\narea is, to a growing extent, channelled through the\r\nUnited Nations system, as well as through non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, by means of the\r\ncentralized cooperation of local government, in\r\naddition to the substantial support provided by the\r\nBrindisi logistics base, whose important role is\r\nintegrated into humanitarian and peacekeeping\r\nactivities in a timely and effective manner.\r\nIn the field of development cooperation, the\r\ninternational community’s renewed attention to the\r\nfight against poverty and in support of the economic\r\nand social advancement of developing countries is\r\ndemonstrated by developments noted in the report,\r\nsuch as the attention that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil high-level segment dedicated to Africa last\r\nJuly; the New African Initiative, adopted in Lusaka by\r\nthe Organization of African Unity; the results of the\r\nThird United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, which adopted the Brussels\r\nDeclaration and an action plan for 2001-2010; and the\r\ngreater cohesiveness of the activities of the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\r\nNations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and\r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\r\nIn this context, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, scheduled to take place in\r\nMonterrey next March — the preparatory work for\r\nwhich is well under way — will be crucial.\r\nAccordingly, it would be advisable for the Organization\r\nand those of its agencies that deal with this area to\r\nincrease their efforts to optimize resources and\r\nstimulate greater synergy in the collective commitment\r\nto development and poverty eradication.\r\nAmong the other results of the renewed efforts at\r\nfostering coordination, the strong commitment to fight\r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS must be underlined. The\r\nSecretary-General’s involvement has made a key\r\ncontribution to the creation of a new global fund for\r\nHIV/AIDS and other contagious illnesses. The Fund\r\nwas launched by the G-8 member countries jointly with\r\nhim in Genoa last July, in the presence of many African\r\nheads of State, who, on that same occasion, were able\r\nto elaborate on the New African Initiative, which had\r\nbeen adopted a few days earlier in Lusaka.\r\nTurning to the issue of the digital divide, which\r\nhas been the subject of debate in recent days during the\r\nhigh-level dialogue on cooperation through\r\npartnership, the impetus provided by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has allowed a greater convergence of the\r\ninitiatives thus far undertaken. This convergence was\r\nstrongly promoted by the Italian presidency of the G-8,\r\nmost visibly through the Naples Conference on E-\r\nGovernment last March. We are heartened by the\r\ndecision to establish an information and\r\ncommunications technology (ICT) task force — a\r\ndecision that was made following intensive\r\ncoordination with the G-8 Digital Opportunity Task\r\n(DOT) Force, whose final report was adopted on the\r\noccasion of the Genoa Summit.\r\nThe structure of the Secretary-General’s report\r\nrightly illuminates the essential link between an\r\ninternational legal order and respect for human rights.\r\n3\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nAs it stated in the final communiqué of the G-8\r\nSummit in Genoa, Italy is convinced that open,\r\ndemocratic and accountable systems of governance,\r\nbased on respect for human rights and the rule of law,\r\nare preconditions for sustainable development and\r\nrobust growth. In the light of this conviction, in July\r\n1998 my country hosted in Rome the Conference that\r\ngave birth to the Statute of the International Criminal\r\nCourt, and hopes that the 60 ratifications it requires to\r\nenter into effect can be obtained as soon as possible.\r\nMore than ever, the tragic events of this sad month of\r\nSeptember have shown us the urgent need for a judicial\r\nforum that is internationally recognized and has\r\nuniversal value, and where the perpetrators of heinous\r\ncriminal acts against humanity can be adjudicated by\r\nthe community of States.\r\nLast week’s tragic events also lent even greater\r\nurgency to the United Nations Convention against\r\nTransnational Organized Crime, which was opened for\r\nsignature last December in Palermo. The entry into\r\nforce of the Convention and of its three Protocols will\r\nconstitute the first valid response in the fight against\r\nevery aspect of the phenomenon of crime. Such crime\r\nknows no borders and may be one of the negative\r\nconsequences of globalization. Fed by trafficking in\r\ndrugs and firearms and by the smuggling of illegal\r\nimmigrants, this phenomenon must be countered with\r\neffective legal instruments.\r\nIn this framework, we must encourage the United\r\nNations system to envisage an even more extensive\r\ninclusion of strong human rights awareness, crime\r\nprevention, criminal justice and institution-building\r\ncomponents in peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe Organization’s activity over the past 12\r\nmonths should clearly be assessed also in the light of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. That document set out a\r\nprecise itinerary, especially considering the delicate\r\npolitical balances that had to be considered. The road\r\nmap just issued by the Secretariat proposes the\r\nobjective of lending greater predictability to the path\r\nwe will follow in the years to come. We must make it\r\nour task to render this path navigable and ensure that it\r\nis wide enough to allow all of us to follow it with\r\ndetermination.\r\nThe activities of the United Nations over the past\r\nyear will thus constitute an important point of reference\r\nin our debate, here in the General Assembly, on the\r\nfollow-up to the September 2000 Declaration by the\r\nheads of State and Government.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): First of all, I\r\nshould like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport and for its succinct introduction this morning.\r\nThe report is concise and highlights the major activities\r\nof the Organization since the adoption of the\r\nMillennium Declaration last year. The six chapters of\r\nthe report focus on the major issues facing the\r\ninternational community at the turn of the new century.\r\nMy delegation believes that the report constitutes a\r\ngood basis for our debate here in plenary on this item,\r\nas well as in the upcoming debates in the main\r\ncommittees.\r\nSince most of the questions raised in the report\r\nwill be touched upon in the general debate that is to be\r\nheld in November, as well as in the committees, today I\r\nshould like to address the following points.\r\nFirst, with respect to the Millennium Declaration,\r\nMembers of the United Nations started the new\r\nmillennium by declaring at the highest level their\r\ncommon vision of a more just, sustainable and peaceful\r\nworld, in which the benefits of development and\r\nglobalization would advance the livelihood of every\r\nnation on this planet; and they adopted concrete, time-\r\nbound objectives aimed at achieving these noble aims.\r\nIn the past 12 months, the implementation of the\r\ngoals set out in the Declaration has been — as can be\r\nseen from the report — and will remain a cross-cutting\r\nobjective of special importance in all of the activities\r\nof the United Nations system. For that reason, this\r\ntheme was rightly given special focus throughout the\r\nreport. I should like to specifically point out that the\r\nGeneral Assembly itself and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil have set good examples in this regard. We\r\nexpress the hope that this focus on the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Declaration will be consistent and\r\nthat this and subsequent sessions of the Assembly and\r\nof its the subsidiary bodies will be role models for\r\nother United Nations bodies.\r\nLet me turn now to the goal of achieving peace\r\nand security. As can be seen in the report, the United\r\nNations has been actively involved in conflict\r\nprevention, peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding. The United Nations should be commended\r\nfor its efforts in these areas, where — as we all\r\nknow — much depends not only on the efforts of the\r\ninternational community but also on the prevailing\r\n4\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\npolitical, economic and social environments, as well as\r\non the political will of whichever parties are involved\r\nor in conflict.\r\nThe specific recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the prevention of armed conflict contained\r\nin his report should be widely supported, and measures\r\nneed to be taken to implement them. Progress has been\r\nregistered in some of the areas of conflict prevention\r\nand peace-building. Here, my delegation would like to\r\ncommend the role of the United Nations, especially of\r\nthe United Nations Transitional Administration in East\r\nTimor, in promoting the peaceful transition of the East\r\nTimorese people to self-government. As a result of the\r\nactivities of the United Nations, the East Timorese are\r\ngradually taking charge of Government responsibilities.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that a prudent approach is needed in the post-\r\nelection period to safeguard the international\r\ncommunity’s considerable and successful investment in\r\nEast Timor’s future.\r\nTurning to the question of disarmament, my\r\ndelegation would like to express its support for the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects. Though the\r\nConference did not achieve consensus on all issues, it\r\nmade a significant first step towards the goal of\r\npreventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade\r\nin these categories of weapons. The efforts in this\r\nregard should be continued.\r\nOne of the issues that is arousing grave concern\r\nin the international community is the question of\r\ndeploying missile defences. In this connection, my\r\ndelegation agrees with the Secretary-General that if\r\nthis question is not addressed in the context of\r\nmaintaining strategic stability, it could threaten not\r\nonly current bilateral and multilateral arms control\r\nagreements but also ongoing and future disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation efforts.\r\nSpeaking of the non-proliferation efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations, my delegation would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express its gratitude to the Department\r\nfor Disarmament Affairs, especially its Regional\r\nCentre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the\r\nPacific, for recently organizing in Sapporo, Japan, a\r\nmeeting of non-governmental experts on ways and\r\nmeans of strengthening Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree status. The meeting concluded that further\r\nconcrete steps need to be taken at the international\r\nlevel to institutionalize that status.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration has put forward a\r\nlong-term agenda for sustainable development. It will\r\ncome to fruition if the efforts of all United Nations\r\nbodies as a whole are coordinated to this end, and if\r\nexisting and new national and international\r\nprogrammes serve this goal. In this regard, my\r\ndelegation looks forward to a fruitful and constructive\r\ndiscussion on the road map towards the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Declaration. We hope that the road\r\nmap will serve both as an umbrella and as an impetus\r\nfor concrete actions to implement the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nIn the period under review, a number of important\r\nevents have taken place in the area of development\r\ncooperation, such as the holding of the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries,\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly on\r\nHIV/AIDS, and its special session on the\r\nimplementation of the outcome of the United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II). The\r\nimportance of these events cannot be overemphasized,\r\nand efforts must now be made to implement their\r\ndecisions and recommendations within the broad\r\nframework established by the Declaration. The special\r\nsession on children, which had to be postponed to a\r\nlater date, should be held as soon as possible. My\r\ndelegation believes that the remaining issues could be\r\nresolved on the basis of realism and bearing in mind\r\nthe pressing basic needs of children.\r\nI would like to commend the positive role played\r\nby the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD) and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) in addressing the\r\nvulnerabilities and difficulties faced by landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries. With their support, the Fifth\r\nMeeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked\r\nand Transit Developing Countries and Representatives\r\nof Donor Countries and Financial and Development\r\nInstitutions was held this year. One of the outcomes\r\nwas a recommendation to hold an international meeting\r\non transit transport cooperation in 2003. My delegation\r\nbelieves that holding such a meeting could make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the implementation of the\r\nrelevant provisions of the Millennium Declaration. We\r\nexpress the hope that the United Nations, particularly\r\nUNCTAD and UNDP, will continue to extend their\r\nvaluable support for the efforts of the landlocked and\r\n5\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\ntransit developing countries to enhance and facilitate\r\ntheir transit transportation, which is vital for\r\naccelerating their trade and development.\r\nAccording to UNCTAD, landlocked developing\r\ncountries, the majority of which are also the least\r\ndeveloped countries, on average spend over 14 per cent\r\nof their export earnings on payments for transport and\r\ninsurance services, while the average for other\r\ndeveloping and developed countries is only 8.8 per cent\r\nand 3.7 per cent, respectively. This and some other\r\nobjective factors impose a heavy burden on landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries, substantially reducing or\r\naltogether negating whatever competitive advantage\r\nthey may have in the world economy. The questions of\r\nthe elimination of poverty, development and stability\r\nall depend to a certain extent on overcoming this\r\nnatural, objective obstacle through cooperation. It is for\r\nthis reason that the group asked the Secretary-General\r\nto reflect the questions and problems of this group of\r\ncountries in his annual report. It is quite unfortunate\r\nthat this year’s report does not reflect the problems of\r\nthis group of countries. My delegation expresses the\r\nhope that, bearing in mind the importance of this\r\nquestion in implementing the provisions of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, it will receive due reflection\r\nin next year’s and subsequent reports.\r\nOn the subject of the fight against international\r\nterrorism, my delegation fully agrees with the\r\nSecretary-General that one of the strengths of the\r\nOrganization is its capacity to adjust to changing\r\ninternational conditions. This 11 September was one\r\nsuch landmark. On that day, the world was shocked and\r\noutraged by the heinous terrorist attacks in New York,\r\nour host city, and in Washington D.C., which caused\r\nthe loss of thousands of human lives, injury and\r\ndestruction.\r\nThe Security Council has rightly described\r\nterrorism as “a threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity” (resolution 1368 (2001), para. 1) and called\r\nupon all States to work together urgently to bring to\r\njustice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors. The\r\nCouncil also called on the international community to\r\nredouble its efforts to prevent and to suppress terrorist\r\nacts. The first resolution adopted at this session of the\r\nAssembly, on 12 September, was also a resolution in\r\nthe same spirit.\r\nMy delegation believes that such acts of\r\nbarbarism can only be considered crimes against the\r\npeace and security of mankind. The United Nations can\r\nand should play a greater role in the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism. As paragraph 224 of the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/56/1) underlines, in the past year, “83\r\nratifications of, and accessions to, the 12 existing\r\nglobal conventions for the prevention and suppression\r\nof international terrorism” have been registered. This\r\nbroadens the legal basis of the cooperation of States in\r\ncombating different manifestations, such as the\r\nhijacking of planes and vessels, the taking of hostages,\r\nterrorist bombing and the financing of terrorist\r\nactivities. The push for universal accession to these\r\nconventions should be continued.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September have also\r\ndemonstrated that the threat of nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological terrorist attacks is real. This should give\r\ndelegations impetus to finalize the draft convention\r\nagainst nuclear terrorism, the text of which has been 98\r\nper cent ready since 1998. My delegation expresses the\r\nhope that consideration of the question of international\r\nterrorism in early October in this plenary will give the\r\nneeded political impetus to promoting further the\r\nelaboration of the comprehensive convention on\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to congratulate Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan on his unanimous re-election for a second term\r\nas Secretary-General of our Organization. His\r\ndedicated leadership and manifold skills have earned\r\nthe respect of Member States and his efforts to find\r\n“constructive solutions to the fundamental problems of\r\nour age” have ensured the support of all Members.\r\nMy delegation is also confident that, under your\r\nleadership, Mr. President, this Assembly will take\r\nconcrete measures to achieve the objective of creating\r\na more developed, sustainable and peaceful world. My\r\ndelegation will do its utmost to help you and the\r\nAssembly to achieve these results.\r\nMr. Wurth (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I\r\nshould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that you will promote multilateral\r\ncooperation at this crucial time.\r\nThe terrorist attacks in New York, Washington,\r\nD.C., and Pennsylvania will require the United Nations\r\nwork to be seen in light of the lessons of 11 September.\r\nOn behalf of my authorities and compatriots, I extend\r\nthe condolences of the people of Luxembourg to the\r\n6\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\npeople of the United States and in particular to the\r\nfamilies of those who were murdered on 11 September.\r\nWe also extend our sympathy to the wounded.\r\nThe terrible killing of that tragic day was deeply\r\nhorrifying. There is no justification for it. Such\r\nmurders affect our Organization and all its Members as\r\ndeeply as they do our host city and country. If we falter\r\nnow, we will be giving in to the terrorists’ fundamental\r\naim of rejecting the common humanity that we defend.\r\nThe attack was an assault on the strongest of States, but\r\nit was on us all because it was against a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. That country can count on our\r\nsolidarity.\r\nTerrorism is the very antithesis of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and of all peoples of the world. We the\r\npeoples seek greater fraternity, not the death of\r\ncivilians and blind destruction. Our Organization can\r\nreact only by strengthening its collective resolve. The\r\nstruggle against terrorism will be the focus of our\r\nefforts and next week’s debate will be an opportunity to\r\nidentify appropriate action based on in-depth analysis.\r\nMr. Ouch (Cambodia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe impressive work of the Organization\r\ndescribed in the excellent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral before us today must certainly be intensified.\r\nThe achievements we have made since the launching of\r\nthe reform of the Organization will be our tools for\r\neliminating the remaining shortcomings. The work of\r\nthis past year was guided by the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and its follow-up, including the recent\r\npublication of the highly useful programme for its\r\nimplementation. We also have a very heavy schedule,\r\nwith many special sessions, conferences and\r\npreparatory meetings. All of these efforts are more\r\nrelevant now than ever before.\r\nWhile it may be true that undeniable progress has\r\nbeen made on some international issues, shortfalls have\r\nalso been identified in the clear and straightforward\r\naccount of the Secretary-General, who makes us aware\r\nof our collective responsibility. I should like to focus\r\non a few points in particular.\r\nThe Secretary-General is right to stress the\r\ncomplexity of conflicts that infringe on international\r\npeace and security and the tragic fact that civilians are\r\noften their first victims. Protecting civilians, women\r\nand children in particular, in areas that are threatened\r\nor affected by armed conflict is a priority need.\r\nConflict prevention will be the main instrument for\r\ndoing so. The Secretary-General’s high-quality analysis\r\nof this issue has inspired a substantive discussion in the\r\nSecurity Council and in the General Assembly. We\r\nmust follow it up with action.\r\nAn integrated approach is needed to avoid new or\r\nto prevent the resurgence of old tensions, as we know\r\nfrom experience on the ground. The participation of\r\nheads of humanitarian and development agencies in\r\nsome Security Council debates has made a significant\r\ncontribution. It is encouraging to note that the current\r\nfocus on prevention, the cessation of hostilities, peace-\r\nbuilding and development has been increasingly\r\nvalidated.\r\nRestructuring in the area of peacekeeping has\r\nregistered significant progress. The United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor and the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\r\nKosovo are operations whose success is founded on the\r\nhigh degree of integration of their various components.\r\nThe presence of the United Nations Organization\r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in\r\ntandem with intensive diplomatic efforts, has enabled\r\nthe withdrawal of foreign troops and the launching of\r\nthe inter-Congolese dialogue.\r\nAmong the other horizontal challenges facing the\r\ninternational community, progress has been made on\r\nthe trade in raw diamonds. The dangers linked to the\r\nillicit traffic in light weapons, which so often fall into\r\nthe hands of terrorists and criminals, remain acute.\r\nSuch weapons kill more than any other in the world\r\ntoday.\r\nThe new Under-Secretary-General for\r\nHumanitarian Affairs and the competent and dedicated\r\nteam from the Office for the Coordination of\r\nHumanitarian Affairs have worked to restructure that\r\nessential service in order to allow it to cope with a\r\nhumanitarian situation that is not improving. We must\r\nremember that civilians, women and children in\r\nparticular, suffer most in emergency situations that are\r\noften prolonged or recurring. While refugees enjoy\r\nprotected status and assistance, persons displaced\r\nwithin their own country are often left destitute, the\r\nvictims of political considerations that prevent\r\nrecognition of their fate within the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n7\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nThe international response to natural disasters is\r\nbeing improved through better preparation and\r\nadequate civilian management of crises. It should be\r\nnoted that humanitarian personnel often have to fear\r\nfor their own safety and the serious loss of life among\r\nthem over the past 12 months is deplorable.\r\nDonors meeting informally within the\r\nHumanitarian Liaison Working Group are closely\r\ninvolved with leaders in the United Nations system.\r\nThe humanitarian tragedy in Afghanistan, compounded\r\nby decades of civil war and by drought, is a cause of\r\nmajor concern today. Luxembourg is actively involved\r\nin the international humanitarian effort through the\r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations and through its\r\ndirect support to the affected population.\r\nLuxembourg’s humanitarian assistance budget\r\ncontinues to grow, along with its financing of\r\ndevelopment activities.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, we reaffirmed our\r\ndetermination to move ahead in many areas relating to\r\ndevelopment. In the wake of the follow-up conferences\r\nto the major United Nations conferences of the 1990s,\r\nwe must set ambitious goals and stress our collective\r\nresponsibility to attain them.\r\nPoverty in conditions that run contrary to respect\r\nfor human beings is an important cause of conflict. It\r\nshould be fought by every means. The Conference on\r\nthe Least Developed Countries of last May was a\r\nconfirmation of solidarity with the poorest peoples.\r\nPreparations for the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development are being carried out in\r\nfull, and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment will be held in one year.\r\nWe welcome the fact that those involved in\r\ndevelopment, including the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, are sharing their\r\nexperiences and coordinating their work. The\r\nrestructuring within various funds and programmes has\r\nbeen courageous and necessary. This should be\r\ntranslated into greater renewed confidence in these\r\nbodies, whose work in development on the ground is\r\nessential. It is by working in partnership that the\r\ninternational community will serve sustainable human\r\ndevelopment — a responsible development that\r\nrespects people, their choices and their natural and\r\ncultural environments. Political leaders must also\r\nshoulder their share of the burden, particularly in\r\ncombating corruption and in setting up transparent\r\nstructures.\r\nIn 2000, official development assistance from\r\nLuxembourg was 0.72 per cent of our gross national\r\nproduct. Thus, we have gone beyond the target set by\r\nthe United Nations. We are seeking to bring it to 1 per\r\ncent.\r\nOnly a community based on the rule of law and\r\nthe acceptance of common rules can provide a stable\r\nbasis for international and national life. To disregard\r\nrecognized fundamental laws is to be banished from the\r\ninternational community. An international legal order is\r\ndeveloping, and law requires that it be applied. Crimes\r\nagainst humanity — and the acts of 11 September,\r\nwhich have been described as such throughout the\r\nworld — should not escape justice.\r\nLuxembourg has ratified the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. We believe in the dual\r\npotential of this court for bringing justice and sending a\r\nmessage of dissuasion. A strong international law that\r\nis implemented vigorously takes nothing away from the\r\nprinciple of legitimate defence. On the contrary, it\r\nencompasses and strengthens it. The criminal courts\r\nthat the Security Council has put in place are already\r\ncontributing to healing wounds, and they require moral\r\nand financial support. But international efforts will be\r\ntruly effective only if they are backed up by the\r\nbuilding of the rule of law at the national level.\r\nThese thoughts bring us back to the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism. I shall come back to and build on this\r\nquestion further during the debate next week.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): We have before us\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization. It covers areas of work that have been\r\naccomplished, and it identifies some of the obstacles\r\nencountered and challenges that we still face. My\r\ndelegation expresses our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report.\r\nLast year during the historic Millennium\r\nAssembly our heads of State and Government set\r\nambitious goals for us, which are encapsulated in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. The clarion call was, and still\r\nis, the need to create a better world for all. It was with\r\na great sense of optimism that we welcomed the new\r\nmillennium that was to herald a new era of\r\ninternational cooperation. We collectively agreed on\r\ndevelopment targets with specific time frames.\r\n8\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nWe are convinced that the tragic events that\r\noccurred in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania\r\nwill provide new impetus to efforts by Member States\r\nto address the phenomenon of international terrorism.\r\nThe finalization of a comprehensive convention is\r\npivotal for the success of our collective action to\r\nprevent and suppress international terrorism. But, as\r\nthe South African Government has stated:\r\n“Whatever the pain the world may be going\r\nthrough, we should avoid the temptations of\r\nracism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and any\r\nother forms of prejudice and discrimination that\r\nthe recent World Conference against Racism so\r\neloquently warned against.”\r\nIn the Declaration, among many other important\r\nissues, we committed ourselves to rid humanity of the\r\nscourge of poverty. We agreed that peace and security\r\nshould be pursued more rigorously internationally, and\r\nthat the international community would unite in its\r\nresolve to tackle the spread of HIV/AIDS. We\r\ncollectively expressed our concern about the obstacles\r\nthat developing countries face in mobilizing resources\r\nneeded to finance sustainable development, and about\r\nadopting a policy of duty-free and quota-free access for\r\nall exports from the least developed countries to\r\ndeveloped country markets.\r\nIn Africa, in our quest to reach the international\r\ndevelopment targets that we agreed to, African leaders\r\nresponded by pledging collectively to put the continent\r\non a path of sustainable development though the New\r\nAfrican Initiative. African leaders have committed\r\nthemselves to the promotion of human rights and good\r\ngovernance. We therefore welcome the initiatives\r\nundertaken by the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) in 2000 to assist parliaments,\r\njustice systems and electoral systems, as reported by\r\nthe Secretary-General. We are also heartened by the\r\ncapacity-building, resource mobilization, service\r\ndelivery and community empowerment initiatives\r\ngoing on in 37 countries.\r\nIn Africa, we have given serious thought to the\r\nfundamental questions underlying the problem of the\r\nhuge disparities in development between the North and\r\nthe South. We have come to realize that we, as\r\ndeveloping countries, can do much to help ourselves\r\nbefore we engage the developed countries on the\r\nimportant steps that they will have to take to support\r\nour efforts. In a way we have reversed the debate\r\naround conditionalities. We have approached the\r\ndeveloped world and the international development\r\ncommunity in search of partnerships that will ensure\r\nthat our efforts are sustained by appropriate support\r\nmeasures. During this session my delegation will\r\nactively engage in the deliberations of the General\r\nAssembly and its different committees in promoting\r\nthis partnership with the continent of Africa on the\r\nbasis of the principles, priorities, objectives and\r\nprogrammes identified in the New African Initiative.\r\nMy delegation supports the ongoing efforts by the\r\nSecretary-General to bring greater awareness and\r\nacceptance by the international community of the need\r\nfor the prevention of armed conflict. We also welcome\r\nefforts to gear the Organization and all its organs for a\r\nculture of prevention. Efforts to improve the conflict\r\nprevention capacities of the Organization coincide with\r\na growing realization by African leaders and people\r\nthat the continent’s destiny must be driven by Africa\r\nitself.\r\nSouth Africa believes that the complex challenges\r\nfacing the United Nations today in the resolution and\r\nmanagement of conflict require that the Secretariat be\r\nadequately structured and has sufficient resources. My\r\ndelegation supported and will continue to support the\r\nreform processes initiated by the Secretary-General and\r\ninformed by the Brahimi report and the efforts of the\r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. In our\r\nview, these reforms will go a long way in improving\r\nthe image of the United Nations in this sphere of its\r\nwork. However, my delegation would like to reiterate\r\nits position that no amount of reform of the United\r\nNations peacekeeping support and management\r\nmechanisms will suffice if they are not backed up by\r\nthe requisite political and financial support to ensure\r\nthat peacekeeping succeeds. This is particularly\r\nimportant for the role of the United Nations in African\r\nconflicts.\r\nOver the past year, the United Nations has again\r\nillustrated its immense worth as a provider of\r\nhumanitarian assistance. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport provides testimony on the millions of people,\r\naffected by conflicts and natural disasters worldwide,\r\nwhose lives have been positively affected by assistance\r\nprovided by the United Nations. My delegation is\r\npleased to note that the United Nations is continuing to\r\nimprove the coordination of its humanitarian activities,\r\nwhich allows better use of scarce funding and prevents\r\ncostly overlaps at the operational level.\r\n9\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nThe plight of internally displaced persons,\r\nespecially in Africa, continues to be of major concern\r\nto my delegation. This concern is underscored by the\r\nserious gaps that were identified in the United Nations\r\nresponse to internally displaced persons by the review\r\nmissions of the Senior Inter-Agency Network on\r\nInternal Displacement. We welcome the creation of a\r\nunit for internally displaced persons in the Office for\r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and hope it\r\nwill promptly begin to address those gaps.\r\nWhile more can surely be done to assist those in\r\nneed of humanitarian assistance, we recognize the\r\nimpediments faced by the United Nations and its\r\nagencies. Foremost among these is the issue of\r\nunderfunding of humanitarian actions. My delegation\r\nstrongly supports the Secretary-General’s call for\r\nimmediate and realistic funding, especially for the so-\r\ncalled forgotten emergencies such as Angola, Somalia\r\nand the Great Lakes region.\r\nIn September 2002, South Africa will host the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. It is our\r\nhope that the Summit will reinvigorate the commitment\r\nof the international community to the goals of\r\nsustainable development. If we are to give effect to a\r\nnew vision of sustainable development, the Summit\r\nshould adopt a concrete and pragmatic programme of\r\naction for the implementation of Agenda 21 in the next\r\ndecade. We believe that one of the biggest threats to\r\nsustainable development is the persistence of poverty\r\nand the widening gap between rich and poor.\r\nTherefore, the eradication of poverty should be the\r\noverriding concern of the Summit. My delegation\r\nwould like to inform the Assembly that the regional\r\nmeeting of the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity in preparation for the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, which was held last week in\r\nMauritius, decided to propose that the theme of the\r\nSummit should be “Poverty eradication as a key to\r\nsustainable development”.\r\nWe have to continue our endeavours to meet the\r\nchallenge we set ourselves in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, that of waging war against poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment, by launching a sustained campaign\r\nto make the right to development a reality for\r\neveryone. We also welcome the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations Information and Communications\r\nTechnology Task Force. We agree that the Task Force\r\nwill harness the power of information and\r\ncommunications technologies for advancing the\r\nmillennium development goals.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, which is to be held in Mexico in 2002, is\r\none more attempt at the intergovernmental level to\r\nmobilize resources to combat poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment. We recognize that these national\r\nand international efforts require genuine partnership\r\nand engagement with all relevant stakeholders.\r\nWe note that the eighth session of the Preparatory\r\nCommission for the International Criminal Court has\r\ncommenced its work, and we call on all participants to\r\nwork expeditiously to resolve the outstanding issues\r\nand to finalize the additional instruments relating to the\r\npractical arrangements necessary for the effective\r\nfunctioning of the Court. We are encouraged by the\r\ngrowing number of signatures and ratifications of the\r\nStatute, which is indicative of the universal acceptance\r\nof the Court and which leaves no doubt that its Statute\r\nwill soon enter into force. My delegation also wishes to\r\nexpress its satisfaction with the significant advances\r\nthat the International Tribunals for both Rwanda and\r\nthe former Yugoslavia have made during the past year,\r\nresulting from the implementation of major reforms\r\naimed at enhancing the efficiency of operations in both\r\nTribunals. We also note with concern the lack of\r\nsufficient resources, which has so far hindered the\r\nestablishment and operation of the Special Court for\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nWe appreciate the Secretary-General’s excellent\r\nreports to the Security Council. His personal attention\r\nto particular crises embodies the will of the\r\nOrganization to better the human condition. Clearly, it\r\nis incumbent upon the Security Council to minimize\r\nthe impact of sanctions on civilian populations. The\r\ndevastating effect of a decade of sanctions on the Iraqi\r\npopulation illustrates the need to improve the\r\nOrganization’s ability to achieve balance between its\r\ntwin imperatives of maintaining international peace\r\nand security and of improving people’s quality of life.\r\nIf the United Nations is to remain true to its\r\nfounding principles, the inalienable rights of the\r\npeoples of Palestine and Western Sahara and of other\r\npeoples which still suffer domination and oppression\r\nmust be addressed as an urgent responsibility.\r\nMr. Alemán (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): Let\r\nme begin by thanking the Secretary-General for the\r\nintroduction of his concise annual report on the work\r\n10\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nof the Organization, and by congratulating him on his\r\nwell-deserved re-election. His intelligent and effective\r\nleadership will enable the United Nations to remain the\r\nfocal point for harmonizing the efforts of Member\r\nStates to attain our common purposes in line with the\r\nprinciples of the San Francisco Charter, which we have\r\nall undertaken to respect.\r\nThe world today faces problems that transcend\r\nnational borders. These are threats that require\r\nconcerted, unified action. The United Nations is the\r\nultimate multilateral forum, and is the only place where\r\nwe can properly deal with such threats in accordance\r\nwith international law. At the Millennium Assembly,\r\nheads of State or Government rightly resolved to make\r\nthe United Nations the best possible mechanism for\r\npromoting the development of all the world’s peoples\r\nand for combating poverty, ignorance and disease.\r\nThey also agreed that we must all fight violence,\r\ninjustice, crime and terrorism — a particularly relevant\r\nissue in the light of the tragic, cruel and despicable\r\nevents that recently occurred in the United States of\r\nAmerica. Here, I shall merely reiterate the deeply felt\r\ncondolences of the Government and the people of\r\nEcuador. The role of our Organization in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is a\r\nbasic component of its responsibilities and it has shown\r\nthat in its intervention in armed conflicts in various\r\nparts of the world through peacekeeping operations,\r\nsome of which have been successful and others which\r\nhave taught us lessons that must be applied in the\r\nfuture.\r\nDisarmament, on one hand, and conflict\r\nprevention, on the other hand, are two sides of the\r\nsame problem. If potential conflicts are resolved in\r\ntime through peaceful methods, then the States\r\ninvolved will have no reason to enter an arms race.\r\nDisarmament will be easier when solutions are found\r\nthrough dialogue and the necessary negotiations and\r\nagreements.\r\nLast August, Ecuador assumed the presidency of\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. I hope that\r\nmy country will be able to contribute to providing\r\nimpetus to end the paralysis of such an important\r\norgan. In any event, it will be guided by the consistent\r\nprinciples of its foreign policy in this regard and its\r\ndeeply felt commitment to general and complete\r\ndisarmament under effective international control.\r\nThe Secretary-General states that in the\r\nMillennium Declaration our leaders agreed to proceed\r\nwith the urgent task of eliminating weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons, and of\r\nreducing the risks of small arms and light weapons and\r\nlandmines. Unfortunately, the indications are not very\r\nencouraging on the first score. We are not moving in\r\nthe right direction there. The possible resumption of\r\nnuclear testing, the eventual deployment of defence\r\nmissiles or the use of outer space for military purposes\r\ncan have a negative impact on disarmament and on the\r\nnon-proliferation regime that has been built up through\r\nlengthy and patient negotiations.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects, which recently concluded in New York\r\nwithout reaching the desired results, is nevertheless one\r\nstep forward in the process of strengthening peace and\r\ninternal and international security.\r\nOn anti-personnel mines, I wish to state with\r\nparticular satisfaction that Ecuador has discharged its\r\ncommitments undertaken within the framework of the\r\nOttawa Treaty and has reached the target set for going\r\nto the third meeting of States parties to that\r\ninternational instrument, just held in Managua, without\r\nany stockpiles of mines. In August this year, as a first\r\nphase, using our own resources, we destroyed 101,458\r\nanti-personnel mines, and just a few days ago, on 11\r\nSeptember, we destroyed an additional 154,344 mines,\r\nthanks to the external assistance channelled through the\r\nOrganization of American States.\r\nWith regard to the economic issues analysed in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, I will focus on the\r\npriority importance my country attaches to the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in Monterrey, Mexico. This is an\r\nexcellent opportunity to define a new worldwide\r\nagreement that must encompass the adequate\r\nmobilization of internal resources, larger and more\r\nstable financial flows, an international trading system\r\nthat offers better access to large world markets for\r\nproducts from developing countries, effective and\r\nlasting solutions to the very serious problem of\r\nexternal indebtedness, which holds hostage the\r\neconomic future of many developing countries, and an\r\nintegral approach to systemic issues, which would\r\nallow for broader participation by developing countries\r\nin decision-making in international economic affairs\r\n11\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nand which promotes the establishment of a new\r\ninternational financial structure.\r\nThis Conference will also be a challenge to the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in the consideration\r\nof economic and social issues, and it cannot be merely\r\nthe repetition of age-old hopes. It must be a step\r\nforward in international cooperation and in the\r\nadoption of realistic policies and measures that will\r\nhelp eradicate poverty and build societies that are more\r\njust and show more solidarity and that give true content\r\nto democratic principles and human rights.\r\nIndeed, the promotion and the defence of human\r\nrights and the almost completed commitment to the\r\ndecolonization process are two major achievements of\r\nour Organization. The international covenants relating\r\nto civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights\r\nstem from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\r\nand the principles contained in the Charter. In addition,\r\nthere are other agreements and conventions to protect\r\nthe rights of women, children and the disabled, for the\r\nelimination of racial discrimination and against torture.\r\nThe imminent entry into force of the International\r\nCriminal Court guarantees that the long arm of\r\ninternational law will reach those responsible for war\r\ncrimes, genocide and crimes against humanity and\r\nthose who became executioners and tyrants of their\r\nown people.\r\nAlthough, as the Secretary-General notes, the\r\nUnited Nations must continue to work hard to reduce\r\nthe gap between human rights norms and applications\r\nthereof, it is equally true that universalization of human\r\nrights is now an important link in the history of the\r\nOrganization and of its commitment to build a more\r\njust and humane world.\r\nMr. Niculescu (Romania): At the outset, allow\r\nme to warmly congratulate the Secretary-General for\r\nthe comprehensive and inspiring introduction of his\r\nannual report, as well as for his achievements of this\r\npast year.\r\nWe are happy to work with him during his second\r\nterm as Secretary-General, and we renew our support\r\nfor his constant efforts aimed at enhancing the\r\nOrganization’s effectiveness, efficiency and relevance.\r\nWhile recognizing the complexities of the tasks\r\nfacing the Organization, the annual report presents an\r\ninformative review of the various activities of the\r\nUnited Nations system, as well as of the efforts made\r\nto find constructive solutions to the fundamental\r\nproblems of our increasingly interdependent world.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration and the “road map”\r\nfor its implementation have set up a broad and\r\nsubstantial agenda for our future common work.\r\nRomania recognizes the United Nations role as an\r\ninstrument of global cooperation in the pursuit of\r\ncommon objectives and remains committed to fulfilling\r\nits share of responsibility in this endeavour.\r\nFrom this perspective, while commending the\r\nreport and its findings, I would like to put forward\r\nsome comments.\r\nDue to the extraordinary circumstances we are\r\nworking under during this session of the General\r\nAssembly, we consider that the international\r\ncommunity must dedicate itself to stopping the recent\r\ntrend towards a dramatic increase in violence and\r\nterrorist acts, and we welcome the debate scheduled for\r\nnext week.\r\nThe human catastrophe, which saddened the\r\nUnited States and the United Nations host city, was a\r\ntragedy shared by the whole of humanity. There are not\r\nenough words to condemn terrorism and fanaticism.\r\nWe cannot afford ever again to pay a price in innocent\r\nlives as a result of horrible acts of terror such as those\r\nthat have been perpetrated. That is why the\r\ninternational community must act immediately and\r\nresolutely. In this context, I would like to inform the\r\nAssembly that on 19 September, the Parliament of\r\nRomania endorsed the decision of the Romanian\r\nNational Security Council to make Romania’s air,\r\nground and maritime facilities available in support of\r\nactions by the United States against terrorism.\r\nThe involvement of the United Nations in\r\npeacekeeping or peace-building operations and in\r\npreventing the recurrence of conflict always was, and\r\nstill is, a central priority of the Organization. We\r\nsupport the work under way aimed at creating secure\r\nand adequate foundations for United Nations peace\r\noperations. Next October, Romania will celebrate 10\r\nyears of uninterrupted participation in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations. Our experience confirms that\r\nthe civilian and military police have an increasing role\r\nin contemporary peacekeeping operations.\r\nConsequently, Romania has decided to contribute to the\r\ninternational presence in Kosovo by providing a\r\n12\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nsignificant number of policemen to assist in the\r\ntransition from conflict to stability.\r\nIn the field of the prevention of armed conflicts,\r\nwe support the recommendations in the report aimed at\r\nenhancing the effectiveness of various United Nations\r\norgans, bodies, agencies and Secretariat departments\r\nand at strengthening cooperation between the United\r\nNations, regional organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society. Last spring in\r\nBucharest, Romania hosted an Inter-Regional Forum\r\non Conflict Prevention and Crisis Management, which\r\nled to the establishment of a regional centre, with the\r\nassistance of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and several donor countries.\r\nIn dealing with existing conflicts, we are very\r\nmuch in favour of closer cooperation and dialogue\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and\r\nsubregional structures and organizations across a broad\r\nspectrum, from peace-building and conflict prevention\r\nto post-conflict rehabilitation, reconstruction and long-\r\nterm development. With due respect to the specific\r\nidentities and experiences of all regional organizations,\r\nI would like to suggest that the relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) might be seen as a\r\nmodel for cooperation between the worldwide\r\nOrganization and a structure with a regional vocation.\r\nOf course, there is still room for further improvement.\r\nIn this respect, I would like to recall some of the\r\nsuggestions made by our Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nwho is the current Chairman-in-Office of OSCE, on the\r\noccasion of his briefing to the Security Council in\r\nJanuary this year. He stressed the importance of the\r\nestablishment of an efficient information exchange\r\nmechanism on potential crises and lessons learned from\r\ncommon field missions; periodical joint assessments on\r\ndevelopments in areas of mutual interest; and the\r\nparticipation of the two organizations in each other’s\r\nmeetings on topics of common concern.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan has repeatedly\r\nsaid, one of the greatest challenges now faced by the\r\ninternational community is the eradication of poverty\r\nand the achievement of sustainable growth through\r\nappropriate policies and institution-building.\r\nIn coming months we will be involved in the final\r\nstages of preparations for two important United\r\nNations conferences in the field of development: the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, which will take place in March 2002 in\r\nMonterrey, and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment — Rio+10 — which will take place in\r\nJohannesburg in September 2002. Both high-level\r\nevents will represent important steps forward for the\r\nglobal community in reaching consensus on the need\r\nfor an innovative approach to financing for\r\ndevelopment, as well as to sustainable development.\r\nRomania reaffirms its commitment to the concept of\r\nsustainable development and to the recommendations\r\nof the Rio Conference on environment and\r\ndevelopment; we are an active partner within the\r\nregional preparation process. In order to respond to the\r\nnew challenges on development end the environment,\r\nthe Romanian Government organized, during the first\r\nhalf of this year, a summit meeting on the environment\r\nand sustainable development in the Carpathian and\r\nDanube region and a regional conference for the\r\nevaluation of the Rio+10 process in the Central and\r\nEastern European countries.\r\nAn important driving force of globalization is the\r\ninformation revolution and the emerging information\r\nsociety. The recent concrete initiative of the United\r\nNations in the field of information and communications\r\ntechnology (ICT) — the setting up of a United Nations\r\nICT task force, on which Romania is represented —\r\nrepresents an important step forward in sustaining the\r\nfight against the so-called digital divide. Romania, as\r\npart of the e-Europe Action Plan, is ready to become a\r\nregional node for United Nations initiatives in the ICT\r\nfield.\r\nIn the same vein, with regard to expanding the\r\nscope of cooperation with the United Nations in\r\nspecific fields, Romania took the initiative of\r\norganizing, in Bucharest last May, an United Nations\r\nprocurement seminar in order to encourage Romanian\r\nenterprises to respond to United Nations procurement\r\nneeds.\r\nIn conclusion, Romania supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his efforts to integrate human rights into the\r\nwhole range of United Nations activities. In this\r\ncontext, we encourage closer cooperation between the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand other United Nations bodies and mechanisms and\r\nregional cooperation structures that already have\r\nvaluable expertise in this field, such as the OSCE. We\r\nwelcome the progress achieved by the United Nations\r\nin promoting and consolidating democracy. The\r\nresolutions adopted this year by the General Assembly\r\n13\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nand the Commission on Human Rights, initiated by\r\nRomania and a significant number of democratic\r\ncountries, provide a new perspective with regard to the\r\ncontribution of the United Nations system in this field.\r\nMrs. Fritsche (Liechtenstein): I would like, first\r\nof all, to reiterate the feelings of deepest sympathy and\r\ncompassion which the Government of Liechtenstein\r\nhas already conveyed to our host country, the United\r\nStates of America, and, in particular, to the victims of\r\nthe horrendous attacks on 11 September. We have all\r\nbeen affected — certainly those of us who consider the\r\ncity of New York our home, albeit a temporary one —\r\nbut our hearts and thoughts go out, first and foremost,\r\nto the American people.\r\nThe world and this Organization are facing an\r\nenormous challenge today. We have known for quite\r\nsome time about the threat of international terrorism,\r\nand yet barely anyone would have been able to predict\r\nthe scope, magnitude and effect on the lives of each of\r\nus of the recent attack. The United Nations is\r\nchallenged to live up to its obligations under the\r\nCharter, in particular with regard to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We are very grateful\r\nto the Secretary-General for his willingness to continue\r\nto serve this Organization. At no time has his\r\nleadership been more needed.\r\nDiscussions on terrorism have taken place in this\r\nbuilding for years. They have often been controversial;\r\nthey have often been emotional.\r\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September have\r\nundoubtedly added a new dimension to these\r\ndiscussions: the recognition has been forced upon us\r\nthat terrorism threatens the life of each and every one\r\nof us, the fabric of our societies and international peace\r\nand security. It is also daunting for us that there are no\r\nquick solutions, no easy remedies, no convenient ways\r\nout. We have been made to understand, in the most\r\nbrutal of ways, that this challenge is one that requires\r\nthe cooperation of all of us. This is where a sustained\r\nresponse from this Organization is required.\r\nOur world has changed in many ways since the\r\nSecretary-General submitted his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization on 6 September, and yet the report\r\nbefore us is of the highest relevance. Just as there are\r\nno quick solutions to the crisis we are facing, there are\r\nno one-track solutions, either. Bringing to justice those\r\nwho committed these outrageous crimes must be our\r\nprimary concern. If we are to find a long-term and\r\nsustained answer to the challenge before us, we must,\r\nhowever, also join forces to eradicate the root causes of\r\nterrorism.\r\nCrisis situations can bring out the best in all of\r\nus. In our daily lives — though they have been far from\r\nnormal over the past two weeks — we have noticed\r\nhow the people of this city have come closer together.\r\nSo has, it seems, the international community, which\r\nwe all represent in here. Reactions worldwide brought\r\nforward a deep recognition of the need for enhanced\r\ninternational cooperation. The sometimes very audible\r\nvoices critical of multilateralism fell silent and were\r\nreplaced by a shared call to join forces for the common\r\ninterest of all. We have to seize this momentum in\r\norder to make the world understand that the United\r\nNations is the one forum in which we all come together\r\nto agree on policies and on ways to implement them.\r\nAt this critical moment, the United Nations must play a\r\ncritical role.\r\nFor several years now, on the occasion of the\r\npresentation of the report on the work of the\r\nOrganization, we have spoken in favour of the efforts\r\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan to work towards a\r\nculture of prevention, in particular the prevention of\r\nconflicts. Sadly, these efforts have taken on a burning\r\nrelevance given the events of 11 September. As in\r\nevery area where prevention is called for, the key issue\r\nis addressing the root causes. Recognizing and fighting\r\nthe reasons which are at the heart of terrorism and\r\nmake such attacks possible is in no way tantamount to\r\ncondoning such acts. It is merely the expression of an\r\nintelligent and rational response to irrational acts which\r\ndefy human comprehension.\r\nThe steps required to design such a powerful\r\nresponse are manifold; enhanced international\r\ncooperation in criminal matters and the suppression of\r\nfinancial flows to terrorist groups come readily to\r\nmind. I wish to pledge at this juncture the full and\r\nunequivocal support of the Government of\r\nLiechtenstein in this respect.\r\nBut we also have to redouble our efforts to\r\neradicate extreme poverty, which further marginalizes\r\nthe disenfranchised of our world; to find political\r\nsolutions to long-standing situations of conflict and\r\ncrisis; to strengthen the rule of law; and to prevent the\r\noutbreak of new conflicts. Above all, we have an\r\nurgent obligation to ensure that there is no gap between\r\npeople of different cultures and civilizations. We have\r\n14\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nto act in a manner which makes clear to our peoples\r\nthat we understand how much we all need each other in\r\norder to create a world for our children that is truly\r\nworth living in, and that we are indeed what the\r\nCharter wanted us to be — a family of nations.\r\nMr. Fall (Guinea) (spoke in French): During the\r\ngeneral debate, a more authoritative voice than mine\r\nwill extend to Mr. Han the congratulations of the\r\nGuinean delegation on his assumption of the\r\npresidency of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly. In the meantime, however, I should like to\r\nsay how pleased I am to see him presiding over our\r\nwork, and I wish to assure him of our cooperation.\r\nI cannot begin consideration of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General without once again expressing our\r\ndeep condolences to the people and the Government of\r\nthe United States of America following the terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September last.\r\nMy delegation joins the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in condemning these barbaric acts, which\r\nhave deeply shocked people everywhere. The horror of\r\nthe tragic events shows the inhuman and cruel nature of\r\nperpetrators of international terrorism and makes it\r\nimperative for all nations to reflect together on how\r\nbest they can combat this scourge.\r\nThe delegation of Guinea will lend its support to\r\nany initiative that may be agreed on following the\r\ndebate on this item.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization — the first since the historic\r\nMillennium Summit — is, in the view of my\r\ndelegation, an excellent  document that is deserving of\r\ncareful study. I should like to extend to Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nour appreciation for the many steps he has taken to\r\nenable the Organization to play its full part and thus to\r\novercome new barriers at the dawn of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Incidentally, it was recognition of his merits\r\nthat led to his well-deserved re-election to head this\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe past year, our Organization has made\r\ncommendable efforts to implement the Political\r\nDeclaration adopted by our leaders at the Millennium\r\nSummit. My delegation welcomes the road map\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General for implementing\r\nthe Declaration. This important document represents a\r\nvaluable tool for attaining the objectives and\r\nimplementing the commitments undertaken at the\r\nSummit.\r\nI should like to comment on a few points in the\r\nreport that are of particular concern to my delegation.\r\nThey relate primarily to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nToday, as in past years, the question of peace and\r\nsecurity is at the very heart of our concerns. Several\r\nhigh-level meetings have been held this past year to\r\nstudy in depth the causes of conflicts and to find\r\nappropriate solutions for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Brahimi report, adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil in parallel with the Millennium Summit, is a\r\nkey document whose effective implementation will\r\nhelp to prevent and manage conflicts at all stages of the\r\nprocess.\r\nLikewise, several working groups have arrived at\r\nrelevant conclusions that will help to establish the basis\r\nfor a lasting peace. In this connection, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the new initiatives of the Secretary-General\r\non conflict prevention and the maintenance of peace.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note also the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the United\r\nNations system, regional and subregional organizations\r\nand civil society, with a view to achieving a global and\r\nintegrated approach to conflict management.\r\nGreater involvement by bodies dealing with\r\ndevelopment and humanitarian affairs within the\r\nUnited Nations system and the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions can help to create a peaceful environment\r\nand to address the root causes of conflicts at the very\r\ninitial stages of prevention. The highly desirable\r\ninvolvement of financial institutions would help to\r\neradicate poverty, which is a significant root cause of\r\nconflicts.\r\nWe encourage sending interdisciplinary missions\r\nto zones of instability. Sending such missions is a new\r\napproach to finding integrated solutions to the multiple\r\nproblems underlying instability in certain regions. In\r\nthis connection, I welcome the interdisciplinary\r\nmission that visited West Africa last February. The new\r\npartnership with the States in our subregion, West\r\nAfrica, will aid in lessening tension.\r\nHere I would welcome the upcoming\r\nestablishment of a United Nations Office in West\r\n15\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nAfrica to strengthen the capacities of the Organization\r\nin the areas of monitoring, early warning and the\r\nprevention of conflicts in the subregion. This\r\ndiplomacy of proximity is a useful tool of preventive\r\ndiplomacy. It bears repeating once again that peace-\r\nbuilding remains the key to lasting peace. While some\r\nprogress has been made in Sierra Leone, there is still a\r\nlong road to travel to a lasting peace. My delegation\r\nendorses the Secretary-General’s appeal to the\r\ninternational community for its sustained support in\r\norder to guarantee the success of the process of\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration in\r\nSierra Leone.\r\nAs for conflict management, my delegation\r\nawaits with interest the Secretary-General’s draft action\r\nplan for peace-building. We hope that the draft plan\r\nwill take into account all the political, economic and\r\nsocial aspects necessary for peace-building.\r\nOn the topic of sanctions, my delegation fully\r\nagrees with the concept of strong, targeted sanctions.\r\nThis kind of sanctions has eased tensions in some parts\r\nof the world. Recent history abundantly proves that in a\r\ncrisis situation, resolutions are not always sufficient to\r\nguarantee the restoration of peace. More binding\r\nmechanisms, such as sanctions, must be contemplated.\r\nHowever, sanctions should not have harmful effects on\r\ninnocent civilian populations.\r\nOn humanitarian issues, my delegation\r\nencourages the initiative of the Secretary-General to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs in order to\r\nsupport action taken by operational bodies to meet the\r\nneeds of displaced persons. In this way, greater\r\nattention could be given to this important group of\r\nconflict victims, which for too long has been neglected\r\nby humanitarian activities. My delegation supports\r\nefforts to establish a culture of protection for civilians\r\nthreatened by armed conflict.\r\nOther important economic, social and cultural\r\nissues have been dealt with in the work of the\r\nOrganization under the guidance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral over this past year.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, our leaders\r\ndecided to give special attention to Africa and called\r\non the United Nations system to play a catalysing role\r\nin the mobilization of resources for development in\r\nAfrica. In accordance with that decision, my delegation\r\nwould like to reiterate the appeal made by the African\r\nheads of State and Government to organize a special\r\nsession of the General Assembly to study how best to\r\nsupport the New African Initiative, adopted by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in Lusaka in July 2001.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nreiterate our support for the Secretary-General. We\r\nencourage him to continue in his second term the work\r\nalready begun and to explore new ways and means of\r\nrestoring peace and international security and\r\nstrengthening international cooperation.\r\nMr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nFirst of all, please allow me to extend my warmest\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Han on his election to the\r\npresidency at this session of the General Assembly. My\r\ncongratulations go also to the other members of the\r\nBureau. I am confident that with the President’s\r\nwisdom and experience, as well as with the support and\r\ncooperation of all Member States, this session will be\r\nable to fulfil its tasks.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation and gratitude to the President at the last\r\nsession, Mr. Harri Holkeri, for his important\r\ncontribution to promoting reforms and to revitalizing\r\nthe work of the General Assembly. I would also like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive and\r\ninformative annual report on the work of the United\r\nNations, which covers all aspects of the Organization’s\r\nwork in the past year, the first year of the new\r\nmillennium. His report deserves our full attention and\r\nconsideration.\r\nBefore commenting on the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, I want to reiterate China’s support for\r\nsubmitting the issue of “Measures to eliminate\r\ninternational terrorism”, agenda item 166, to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for consideration. The terrorist\r\nattacks in New York and Washington on 11 September\r\nhave once again demonstrated that at present terrorism\r\nis a salient problem and has become a major threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, and that all countries\r\nin the world should strengthen cooperation and make\r\njoint efforts, for the sake of their common interests, to\r\nprevent and combat all forms of terrorist activities. The\r\nUnited Nations should play an important role in this\r\nregard. The Chinese delegation is going to participate\r\nactively in the relevant discussions and make its own\r\ncontribution to strengthening international cooperation\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\n16\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nNow I wish to share with the Assembly my views\r\non a few issues related to the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. First, I would like to speak about the question\r\nof peace. Last September, at the Millennium Summit,\r\nthe United Nations made an explicit commitment,\r\nsaying that it was “determined to establish a just and\r\nlasting peace all over the world in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter” (Millennium\r\nDeclaration, resolution 55/2, para. 4) and would\r\n“spare no effort to free our peoples from the scourge of\r\nwar” (ibid., para. 8). In the past year, both the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly have reviewed the\r\nBrahimi report and actively explored effective ways of\r\nstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping capacities\r\nand effectiveness. The Secretariat has also been making\r\nadjustments and reforms accordingly. At the same time,\r\nthe Secretary-General and other parties concerned have\r\nstepped up their efforts to promote peace. At present,\r\nin some regions, Africa in particular, United Nations\r\npeacekeeping efforts have achieved positive results.\r\nHowever, the world is still far from peaceful.\r\nPeople in many countries are still living in conditions\r\nof misery because of war and disturbances. Regional\r\nconflicts are occurring one after another, due to ethnic,\r\nreligious and territorial disputes, as well as to the fight\r\nfor resources. A case in point here is the continuing\r\nconflict between Palestine and Israel, which has\r\nseriously undermined regional peace and stability. At\r\nthe same time, such phenomena as illegal drug-\r\ntrafficking and abuse, the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment, the spread of diseases and the refugee\r\nproblem have done more notable harm to security than\r\never before. The rampant and unchecked activities of\r\nterrorists, separatists and extremists have caused ever\r\ngreater damage and pose a new challenge to peace and\r\nsecurity. The effective maintenance of international\r\npeace and security is, as always, an urgent and\r\npertinent issue.\r\nIt is an indisputable fact that the overwhelming\r\nmajority of today’s conflicts occur in economically\r\nunderdeveloped countries and regions. Extreme\r\npoverty has severely hindered the economic\r\ndevelopment and social progress of those countries and\r\nregions, causing regional disturbances and even armed\r\nconflicts. The international community must therefore\r\nstrike at the roots of the problems and make earnest\r\nefforts to help developing countries solve the more\r\nfundamental issue of economic backwardness, a\r\nprimary catalyst of conflict. Past experience in conflict\r\nresolution in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe\r\nhas demonstrated that the most effective way to prevent\r\nand resolve conflict and to achieve lasting peace and\r\ncommon security is to resolve differences and disputes\r\nthrough dialogue, negotiation and consultation in strict\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. This is the principle that must\r\nalways be strictly followed in the process of preventing\r\nand resolving conflicts.\r\nWith respect to disarmament, a series of negative\r\ndevelopments in recent years in the field of\r\ninternational security has led the multilateral\r\ndisarmament and arms control process into a stalemate,\r\nattracting widespread attention in the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nChina agrees with the Secretary-General’s\r\nanalysis in his report of the deployment of national\r\nmissile defences and its consequences. The deployment\r\nof such defences will threaten current and future\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation efforts. The Treaty\r\nbetween the United States of America and the Union of\r\nSoviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of Anti-\r\nBallistic Missile Systems (ABM Treaty) not only\r\ninvolves the signatory countries, but also bears critical\r\nimportance and relevance to maintaining global\r\nstrategic balance and stability, as well as to promoting\r\ninternational disarmament and the non-proliferation\r\nprocess. The success of international disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation efforts depends on the maintenance\r\nand observance of this Treaty. At its fifty-fourth and\r\nfifty-fifth sessions, the General Assembly, by\r\noverwhelming majorities, adopted resolutions on the\r\npreservation of and compliance with the ABM Treaty,\r\ndemonstrating that most countries of the world demand\r\nthat the countries concerned maintain and strictly abide\r\nby the ABM Treaty. The United Nations should\r\ncontinue to scrutinize the development of national\r\nmissile defences and take the necessary steps to\r\nprevent this dangerous situation from deteriorating any\r\nfurther.\r\nThe development of an anti-missile system using\r\nouter space as a base, which will extend the arms race\r\nfrom land and oceans to outer space, will have very\r\nserious consequences. It has therefore become urgent\r\nand timely to establish, through negotiations, an\r\ninternational legal instrument on the prevention of an\r\narms race in outer space. For each of the past many\r\nyears, the General Assembly has adopted by an\r\noverwhelming majority a resolution on the prevention\r\n17\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nof an arms race in outer space. The Conference on\r\nDisarmament should make this an issue of priority and\r\nstart relevant negotiations immediately.\r\nIt is the common aspiration of people of all\r\ncountries and an important task for the international\r\ncommunity to promote the nuclear disarmament\r\nprocess and to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world as\r\nsoon as possible. The 2000 Review Conference of the\r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons was convened successfully and its\r\nFinal Document provides clear guidance for the\r\nprocess of nuclear disarmament. The international\r\ncommunity should take concrete steps to promote that\r\nprocess. The international community as a whole\r\nshould also work to promote the implementation of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development,\r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons\r\nand on Their Destruction and the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production and\r\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin\r\nWeapons and on Their Destruction. It should also\r\nremove artificial barriers so as to achieve the\r\ncomprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of\r\nthose two types of weapons of mass destruction at an\r\nearly date.\r\nThe question of development, in parallel with the\r\nquestion of peace, is another major issue facing the\r\nworld today. Promoting development is an essential\r\ntask for the United Nations in this new millennium.\r\nOver the past year, when all countries have been\r\nlooking forward to ensuring that globalization becomes\r\na positive force for all the world’s people, the situation\r\nof developing countries has deteriorated rather than\r\nimproved. The challenges they face have increased\r\nrather than decreased. The gap between the developing\r\nand the developed countries is widening rather than\r\nnarrowing. Information poverty in the developing\r\ncountries has been exacerbated.\r\nAll this has seriously bottlenecked the\r\ndevelopment of developing countries as well as the\r\nsustained development of developed countries. It has\r\nalso posed a potential threat to international stability.\r\nWe appreciate the new efforts of the United Nations to\r\nhelp countries to pursue their development goals, to\r\nlaunch their priority projects and to eradicate poverty.\r\nAt the same time, however, we have also noticed that,\r\ncompared to other fields, the United Nations input in\r\nthe field of development is seriously insufficient. This\r\nsituation must change.\r\nAs humanity steps into the new century, countries\r\nhave placed even higher expectations in the United\r\nNations. The United Nations must play a more active\r\nand greater role in eradicating poverty, narrowing the\r\nNorth-South gap and promoting universal prosperity.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report indicates,\r\n“If the international community is to meet its\r\ngoals of development and poverty eradication,\r\neconomic growth in developing economies must\r\naccelerate. At the same time, disparities in\r\nprevailing poverty rates both within and between\r\ncountries will require targeted attention.” (A/56/1,\r\npara. 129)\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will work\r\nactively towards establishing a new international\r\neconomic order featuring equal cooperation and\r\ncommon development, so as to ensure that economic\r\nglobalization benefits the international community as a\r\nwhole. We also hope that the United Nations will work\r\nto change the situation in which international economic\r\naffairs are in most cases undemocratically dominated\r\nby a few countries and to reform the international\r\nfinancial and trade system so as to ensure the equal\r\nparticipation of developing countries.\r\nAt the same time, developed countries should, in\r\nconsideration of their long-term interests, take concrete\r\nsteps to open markets, transfer technologies, increase\r\ntheir official development assistance to developing\r\ncountries and reduce or cancel the latter’s debts, so as\r\nto create conditions conducive to their own sustained\r\ndevelopment in the future. Furthermore, the United\r\nNations and the rest of the international community\r\nshould take real action to meet the special needs of the\r\nleast developed countries, the African countries in\r\nparticular, and help them to strengthen their capacity-\r\nbuilding, eradicate poverty and tackle the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS. Efforts should be made to expand the\r\nexisting debt reduction and cancellation initiatives and\r\nto provide market access with more favourable terms to\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration set many specific\r\ngoals and developed countries made many pledges in\r\nthis regard at the Third United Nations Conference on\r\nLeast Developed Countries, which was held earlier this\r\nyear. We appeal to the international community to join\r\nhands to realize these goals, to which developed\r\ncountries in particular should make positive\r\ncontributions.\r\n18\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I am\r\nstill terribly moved by the events that took place last\r\nweek in this city and Washington. I must begin by\r\nexpressing my country’s solidarity with the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States, victims of\r\nan insane demonstration of terrorism. We hope that this\r\nglobal scourge, of which all countries represented here\r\nare potential victims, will for that reason be a factor for\r\ncohesiveness and cooperation in our implacable\r\nstruggle to eliminate it.\r\nWe would like to address the report of the\r\nSecretary-General by beginning with the paragraph that\r\nrefers to activities of the Organization relating to the\r\nelimination of terrorism, although I will make\r\nadditional comments later in the debate on this issue.\r\nUniversal or regional conventions, existing or\r\nunder negotiation, that establish ways and means to\r\neliminate various forms of terrorism may have seemed\r\nto us until now to be sufficient response. We certainly\r\nshould ensure the broadest implementation of those\r\nthat are in force and do everything possible so that the\r\ntwo conventions that are currently being negotiated are\r\nconcluded and, if possible, adopted during this session.\r\nStill, we should ask whether traditional legal\r\ninstruments are the proper response to the challenge\r\nthat the terrorists have placed before humanity. We\r\nthink that new approaches should be sought to achieve\r\nmore effective results and to encourage all\r\nGovernments to participate in this combat, which\r\ncannot be won unless all are firmly determined to\r\nimplement together the measures that will lead to the\r\nprevention and final elimination of terrorism.\r\nStrengthening international cooperation is also\r\nnecessary to combat two other global enemies of\r\nhumanity — poverty and the deterioration of the\r\nenvironment. We note that the United Nations\r\ncontinues to devote considerable resources to the fight\r\nagainst poverty and that its agencies are working\r\ntogether to promote the development of developing\r\ncountries. However, the results have been meagre.\r\nPerhaps the time has come to explore other strategies\r\nand ways and means that would make it easier to\r\nachieve more satisfactory results.\r\nMeanwhile, our expectations and hopes are\r\nplaced on the upcoming conferences, that of the World\r\nTrade Organization in Doha and that on financing for\r\ndevelopment in Mexico next year. We hope, inter alia,\r\nthat these conferences will bring us closer to a real\r\nliberalization of international trade, which is a goal that\r\ndeveloping countries have sought for so long,\r\nconvinced that in the long run the elimination of\r\nprotectionism will benefit everyone.\r\nUruguay notes with concern the slowness of\r\nprogress in the less developed countries with regard to\r\nhuman and social development. Accordingly, we\r\nsupport the adoption of special measures that would\r\nhelp those countries, in particular measures that have\r\nbeen proposed in the political declaration and\r\nprogramme of action adopted by the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries\r\nlast May. At the same time, we would like to draw\r\nattention to the fact that it is necessary not to overlook\r\nassistance to countries that, while not among the least\r\ndeveloped, nonetheless confront serious problems that\r\nare delaying or paralysing their progress towards\r\ndevelopment. We must ensure that the development\r\nprocess in those countries does not regress for lack of\r\nassistance, which could increase the number of least\r\ndeveloped countries. There were 23 of least developed\r\ncountries in 1971, 34 in 1981, 46 in 1991 and 49 in\r\n2001. We must prevent any increase in this number.\r\nThe third great global enemy is the deterioration\r\nof the environment. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nleads us to two conclusions. First, the health of the\r\nplanet is not improving. Rather, it is evolving in a way\r\nthat is going to lead us, in the terms employed in the\r\nreport, to “potentially devastating results for human\r\ndevelopment and the welfare of all species” (A/56/1,\r\npara. 173). My delegation has carefully considered the\r\nweight of this apocalyptic terminology, which is a very\r\nclear sign of the seriousness of the situation.\r\nThe second conclusion is that if we are moving\r\ntowards the aforementioned disaster, it is not because\r\nwe do not know what should be done. In the last 30\r\nyears, environmental legislation, both national and\r\ninternational, has proliferated in an extraordinary\r\nmanner. But we are now facing our old enemy —\r\nourselves. Conventions are not ratified, or, if they are\r\nratified, they are not implemented. The declarations\r\nand resolutions are piling up and are forgotten.\r\nEverything is turning into a dead letter as States refuse\r\nto fulfil their obligations. If there is no change in\r\nattitude on our part, we will leave to future generations\r\nthe threatened and insecure world we now live in. It is\r\nin our hands to change it.\r\n19\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nParagraphs 88 and 89 of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General give us, in a concise synthesis, a\r\ndiscouraging account of the situation in the world vis-\r\nà-vis the serious problems threatening international\r\npeace and security, which affect the well-being of all of\r\nhumanity. Some of these problems result from natural\r\ndisasters. Others, which constitute the majority, result\r\nfrom conflicts caused by human beings. This has led\r\nthis Organization to stretch to the limits its ability to\r\ndeal with these problems by means of humanitarian\r\nassistance and deploying peacekeeping operations. The\r\nhumanitarian work of the United Nations to deal with\r\ncrises caused by natural disasters and other\r\nemergencies is praiseworthy, particularly if one takes\r\ninto account the endemic lack of sustained financing\r\navailable to deal with the dizzying increase in refugees,\r\ninternally displaced persons and victims in general. To\r\nthis we must often add restrictions on reaching affected\r\nareas and security problems for humanitarian staff. We\r\nnote with concern that there are serious deficiencies in\r\nthis humanitarian response from the United Nations,\r\nowing to a lack of money and what the Secretary-\r\nGeneral called “insufficient efforts by some agencies in\r\ntheir designated areas” (ibid., para. 95). We also would\r\nhave liked to have had some more information about\r\nthis point, as well as about what measures the\r\nSecretary-General should have adopted to make up for\r\nthose shortcomings.\r\nDuring the previous session we emphasized the\r\nfact that we must shore up the information and analysis\r\nservices of this Organization. In his report on the\r\nprevention of armed conflicts (A/55/985), the\r\nSecretary-General considers progress that has been\r\nachieved in this connection and puts forward some\r\nrecommendations to increase current efforts. These\r\nactivities deserve our firmest support and should\r\ncontinue until the United Nations can affirm that it\r\nreceives all information relating to situations, events\r\nand trends that may have international repercussions,\r\nearly enough so that it can take preventive measures.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has already commenced a process to improve\r\nthe United Nations capacity to maintain peace and has\r\nadopted or intends to adopt a series of measures listed\r\nin paragraph 45 of the report. The Secretary-General\r\nnonetheless warns that insofar as Africa is concerned,\r\nthe increase in the peacekeeping capabilities of African\r\ncountries should not lead to a reduction in the\r\nparticipation of States from other regions in\r\npeacekeeping operations on that continent.\r\nMy country — which is a major contributor of\r\ntroops and equipment in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and whose civilian and military observers\r\nparticipate in many other operations in Africa and\r\nelsewhere — welcomes the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to set up effective support structures for the\r\nthousands of individuals who daily risk their lives in\r\nincreasingly dangerous situations where the protection\r\nof the civilian population, especially women and\r\nchildren, is of special importance.\r\nBut, as a major contributor to peacekeeping\r\noperations, Uruguay is alarmed by the diminished\r\navailability of resources for peacekeeping operations in\r\nAfrica. Contingents from my country have taken on an\r\nextremely significant role in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo in guaranteeing greater security and\r\nsafety for the civilian population and to ensure the\r\npeaceful reopening of river routes. Accordingly, we\r\nview as highly appropriate the appeal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping\r\nOperations for strengthened cooperation and\r\ncoordination throughout the system.\r\nMr. Sun (Republic of Korea): Regrettably, I will\r\nbe beginning my statement on a sad note. Almost two\r\nweeks have elapsed since the horrific terrorist attack of\r\n11 September, but the wound it has inflicted on the host\r\ncountry is so deep that we all remain profoundly\r\ntraumatized to this day. Therefore, I think it only\r\nappropriate briefly to share my thoughts on terrorism at\r\nthe outset.\r\nThe terrorist attack, which occurred on the\r\nopening day of this session of the General Assembly,\r\nsent terrifying shock waves throughout the whole\r\nworld and caught people across the globe by surprise.\r\nWe must stand very firm in fighting such terrorist\r\nattacks, as they pose a threat not only to the United\r\nStates but to the entire international community.\r\nWe commend the prompt action taken by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council in\r\nadopting resolutions condemning the attack in the\r\nmidst of an unanticipated disruption of the meeting\r\nschedule. My delegation hopes that the United Nations\r\nwill continue to play a central role in eliminating\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\n20\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nWe will further elaborate on our position on\r\nterrorism at the forthcoming plenary meeting devoted\r\nto that subject, but I would like to make one point\r\nclear: any one of us could fall victim to terrorism at\r\nany moment. Thus, this kind of terrorism constitutes a\r\nself-destructive affront to the dignity and civilization of\r\nmankind, and should be punished and eliminated by all\r\nmeans.\r\nLet me now turn to our main topic, namely the\r\nannual report of the Secretary-General on the work of\r\nthe Organization (A/56/1). What made the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly unique was the fact\r\nthat it was shaped largely by the Millennium Summit.\r\nIndeed, the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration\r\nhas been the main topic of our deliberations throughout\r\nthe United Nations system over the past year, and much\r\nof the work of the United Nations has been carried out\r\nin the context of follow-up to the Millennium Summit.\r\nNaturally, one would assume that our discussion\r\nof agenda item 10, on the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization, would centre\r\non the follow-up to the Millennium Summit. However,\r\nin addition to the annual report, this year we also have\r\nthe report entitled “Road map towards the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration” (A/56/326), which was released last week.\r\nAs the roadmap report offers a concrete programme of\r\naction to meet the ambitious objectives outlined in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, I look forward to discussing\r\nthe follow-up measures at some point in the future.\r\nBefore commenting on some of the issues\r\naddressed in the annual report, I would like to extend\r\nmy heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan on his\r\nre-election to the post of Secretary-General. The\r\nelection of Mr. Kofi Annan to a second term testifies to\r\nhis exemplary guidance of the world body over the past\r\nfive years. I have no doubt that, with the well-earned\r\ntrust of the international community and with his\r\noutstanding vision and leadership, Mr. Annan will\r\ncontinue successfully to lead the United Nations for\r\nanother five years.\r\nI find it highly encouraging that Member States\r\nhave pledged on many occasions, including at the\r\nMillennium Summit, to move the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations in the field of international peace and\r\nsecurity from a culture of reaction to a culture of\r\nprevention. In that context, my delegation welcomes\r\nthe collective will of all Member States to further\r\ndevelop the capacity of the United Nations to address\r\nthe root causes of conflicts.\r\nWe highly appreciate that, following a\r\ncomprehensive review, during the fifty-fifth session of\r\nthe General Assembly, of the report (A/55/305) of the\r\nPanel on United Nations Peace Operations chaired by\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, a sincere effort to implement the\r\nreport’s recommendations is now under way. Owing to\r\nthe multifaceted nature of today’s conflicts, it is\r\nextremely difficult to find a simple, universally\r\napplicable solution. Therefore, I think it appropriate\r\nthat the Secretary-General should continue to increase\r\ninterdisciplinary fact-finding missions and dispatch\r\nspecial envoys and representatives to their respective\r\nregions, while encouraging regional organizations to\r\nplay a more active role in that endeavour. We welcome\r\nthe renewed efforts of the United Nations to seek\r\nmultidisciplinary, integrated approaches to conflict\r\nprevention, and we note that there has been remarkable\r\nprogress in that area.\r\nIn my own region, the full support of Member\r\nStates for the historic inter-Korean summit, expressed\r\nthrough resolution 55/11, adopted by consensus at the\r\nfifty-fifth session of the General Assembly, contributed\r\nto the advancement of peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\nWith that support, the Republic of Korea will continue\r\nto exert efforts to advance the process of peace and\r\nreconciliation. We appreciate the Secretary-General’s\r\ncontinued interest in this process on the peninsula,\r\nmost recently reflected in his statement welcoming the\r\nresumption of ministerial talks between the Republic of\r\nKorea and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMy delegation welcomes his expressed resolve to\r\nsearch for ways and means to contribute to inter-\r\nKorean rapprochement and other positive\r\ndevelopments on the Korean peninsula.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, we share the\r\nSecretary-General’s assessment that the level of\r\ninternational cooperation in disarmament remains\r\ndisappointingly low. But since multilateral\r\ndisarmament negotiations are largely contingent on the\r\ncurrent international security situation, we should not\r\nlose sight of the virtues of patience and optimistic\r\nthinking. In that context, my delegation hopes that the\r\nFirst Committee’s deliberations will proceed in a more\r\nconstructive manner.\r\nIn the field of development, the unanimous\r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration last year\r\n21\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nsignalled a high-level political commitment on\r\ninternational development assistance and\r\nenvironmental advancement. I commend the leading\r\nrole taken by the United Nations in this field over the\r\ncourse of the past year.\r\nOf particular note are two follow-ups to historic\r\nevents made in the field of United Nations-led\r\ninternational economic cooperation: the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries\r\nand the special session of the General Assembly on\r\nhuman settlements. I am also pleased with the success\r\nof the preparatory processes for the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nI believe that a focused approach to development\r\nissues, with an emphasis on bridging the digital divide\r\nand promoting development in Africa, deserves\r\nconsideration. In addition, I find the United Nations\r\nefforts under the leadership of the Secretary-General to\r\nstrengthen its relations with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the private sector to be very timely and\r\nrelevant. I hope that further progress will materialize in\r\nthis relatively new field of cooperation.\r\nAs we approach such significant international\r\nevents as the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, I hope that the discussion of economic\r\nand environmental issues during the fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly will be more vitalized than\r\never before.\r\nThe United Nations has made great headway in\r\nthe area of human rights with the adoption of the\r\noptional protocol to the Convention on the Elimination\r\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the\r\ntwo optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights\r\nof the Child.\r\nFurthermore, the recent special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit on Social Development, as well as the special\r\nsessions on Habitat and HIV/AIDS, have further\r\nstrengthened the role of the United Nations in\r\nenhancing human rights and social development around\r\nthe world.\r\nThe special session on children has been\r\npostponed in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of 11\r\nSeptember. But we have no doubt that the momentum\r\ngenerated throughout the preparatory process will be\r\nmaintained, so that when it does eventually take place,\r\nthe special session will prove to be an important\r\nmilestone in the international effort to make this a\r\nworld fit for children.\r\nI greatly appreciate the humanitarian assistance\r\ndelivered by the United Nations humanitarian agencies\r\nduring the past year, and welcome improved\r\ncoordination within the humanitarian community. As\r\nthis year marks the tenth anniversary of the\r\nestablishment of a humanitarian assistance mechanism\r\nwithin the United Nations, more focus needs to be\r\nplaced on the comprehensive assessment of\r\nhumanitarian activities and on the possible\r\nreorganization of those mechanisms.\r\nSecuring sufficient funds is essential for the\r\nsuccessful operation of humanitarian activities.\r\nMember States should pay special attention to the\r\ncurrent trend of decreased funding, and the Secretariat\r\nshould explore avenues to optimize the allocation of\r\nresources to agencies.\r\nFinally, let me briefly touch upon the topic of\r\nglobal partnership. It is noteworthy that this year’s\r\nreport deals with partnership in a separate chapter. The\r\nallocation of a separate chapter for this issue reflects\r\nthe growing realization within the United Nations\r\nsystem of the ever-increasing importance of forging\r\nglobal partnerships with civil society: the business\r\ncommunity, academia and non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nBy incorporating input and resources from civil\r\nsociety into its own work, the United Nations can\r\nbecome more meaningful and accountable to the\r\ngeneral public. In this regard, we commend this year’s\r\napproach and hope it will continue in the years ahead.\r\nMr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I wish\r\nfirst to thank the Secretary-General for his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization contained in document\r\nA/56/1. The reference in that report to an international\r\npanorama characterized by strong contrasts between\r\nencouraging events and dangerous threats was\r\nunfortunately confirmed two weeks ago with the\r\nreappearance of international terrorism in its most\r\nferocious expression. This can only merit our\r\ncondemnation and our solidarity with the victims and\r\nthe Government and people of the United States.\r\nThat brutal event confirms that it is necessary to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations, as the sole universal\r\n22\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nbody capable of dealing with the new challenges before\r\nmankind. That unfortunate event has dramatically\r\ndemonstrated that despite all the levels of\r\ncommunication and trade caused by globalization,\r\ndespite all that none of the critical questions before us\r\ncan be resolved in an exclusively national environment,\r\nas was correctly noted by the Secretary-General.\r\nThe yearly debate of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral provides us with the opportunity to think\r\ngenerally and clearly about the broad range of subjects\r\ncovered by the tasks of our Organization, avoiding\r\nfalling in the almost inevitable fragmentation that\r\naccompanies specific consideration of every item. Our\r\nprimary consideration is directed at the importance of\r\nmaintaining the perspective on the existing dynamic\r\nbetween peace and security and human rights and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt the past Millennium Assembly, the President\r\nof the Republic of Argentina, Fernando de la Rua,\r\nemphasized the relationship between poverty and\r\nconflicts and between the lack of development and\r\ninstability, noting the need to attack the profound\r\ncauses of many current crises. In that regard, we feel\r\nthat it is necessary to continue the efforts of the\r\nOrganization and Member States to eliminate poverty.\r\nFurthermore, it is our understanding that only stable\r\nnational societies can provide the cement for an\r\ninternational order in which peace and security reign.\r\nIn order to achieve those societies, beyond the\r\nnecessary economic and social development, we agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General that it is important to\r\npreserve respect for popular sovereignty, the\r\nresponsibility of the authorities, respect for the rights\r\nand fundamental guarantees of individuals and the rule\r\nof law. It is on the basis of democratic, plural and\r\ntolerant national societies that the rule of law will be\r\nrespected in international relations. Thus, we note our\r\nconcern about the existing gap between human rights\r\nnorms and their implementation, and we commend the\r\nwork of the Commission on Human Rights to fill this\r\ngap in order to ensure that there will be universal\r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nWe strongly support the Secretary-General’s\r\nemphasis on preparing a plan of action for peace-\r\nbuilding. We believe that a culture for preventing\r\nconflict that will take into account social, economic\r\nand political problems in a broad way will be one of\r\nthe most effective tools for ensuring fulfilment of the\r\ngoals of the United Nations regarding peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping, we support the\r\nestablishment of realistic mandates based on a common\r\nstrategy, and we reiterate our support for the tasks that\r\nare carried out by the Organization’s peacekeeping\r\noperations. Argentina will continue to participate in\r\nsuch operations, as we have been doing for the past 50\r\nyears, despite the restrictions imposed by our current\r\nfinancial difficulties.\r\nIn the field of disarmament, my country will\r\ncontinue tirelessly to advocate that all States give up\r\ntheir weapons of mass destruction and work actively to\r\nensure strict compliance with their obligations under\r\nvarious treaties in this area so that the application of\r\nsuch treaties can become universal.\r\nWe are also concerned about the excessive and\r\ndestabilizing accumulation of conventional arms, in\r\nparticular small arms. We will therefore continue to\r\nsupport progress in this field through the speedy\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action of the\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which was\r\nadopted in July.\r\nIn the humanitarian sphere, I would like to\r\nreiterate the deep appreciation of the Argentine\r\nRepublic for the work carried out by the Office for the\r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the various\r\nagencies within the United Nations system that deal\r\nwith humanitarian issues. At the same time, I would\r\nlike to express my Government’s concern about the fact\r\nthat attacks on humanitarian personnel are continuing\r\nand convey our condolences to and express our\r\nsolidarity with the families and friends of those who\r\nhave been attacked.\r\nWe believe that protection must be increased for\r\ncivilians in armed conflict, who continue to be the\r\nmain and innocent target of such attacks. Many of such\r\nvictims are among the most vulnerable groups, such as\r\ninternally displaced persons, women and children. Now\r\nis the time to implement the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General, in particular the most urgent ones,\r\non the basis of Security Council resolutions 1265\r\n(1999) and 1296 (2000).\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General is right to\r\nhave singled out the International Criminal Court and\r\nthe International Tribunals in his reports in recent years\r\n23\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nin the chapter dealing with the international legal order\r\nand human rights. Argentina participated fully and on\r\nan ongoing basis in the international effort that began\r\nseveral years ago to develop an International Criminal\r\nCourt as a legal means of filling the vacuum that\r\ncurrently exists with regard to bringing criminals to\r\ntrial and suppressing crime. We look forward to the\r\nentry into force of the statute of the Court and commit\r\nourselves to supporting the actions of the Court in the\r\nfuture.\r\nFurthermore, my country would like to express its\r\nsatisfaction with the entry into force of the Optional\r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All\r\nForms of Discrimination against Women; we hope that\r\nthe two Optional Protocols to the Convention on the\r\nRights of the Child will also enter into force soon. We\r\nwould also like to express our approval of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights resolution on access to\r\nmedication in the context of pandemics such as\r\nHIV/AIDS, as the Secretary-General has done in his\r\nreport.\r\nWith regard to sustainable development, we\r\nsupport the preparatory process for the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development and have been actively\r\nparticipating in that process at the regional and global\r\nlevel. We offer our unreserved support for the\r\nstrengthening of the multilateral regimes for\r\nenvironmental protection.\r\nFinally, with regard to the functioning of the\r\nOrganization, we believe that the adoption, after\r\nlengthy and often difficult negotiations, of a resolution\r\non comprehensive human resources reform, is, together\r\nwith the decisions taken in relation to the reform of the\r\nscale of assessments, one of the most important\r\ndecisions adopted during the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This will give the Secretariat\r\ngreater flexibility and improve its ability to manage\r\nhuman resources, while providing the necessary\r\nsafeguards for staff members, who, as we stated when\r\nthe issue was under consideration, are the most\r\nvaluable asset of this Organization.\r\nMr. Manolo (Philippines): I would like first of\r\nall to congratulate the President on his well-deserved\r\nelection. At the same time, I wish to convey my\r\nGovernment’s deepest sympathies to the people of New\r\nYork City and the United States for the barbaric\r\nterrorist attack launched almost two weeks ago.\r\nMy delegation would also like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive, substantive\r\nand timely report on the work of the Organization. In\r\nview of the limited speaking time, however, I will\r\nconfine my remarks to just some of the issues raised in\r\nthe report.\r\nChapter I of the Secretary-General’s report starts\r\nby describing his effort to move the United Nations\r\nfrom a culture of reaction to one of prevention. We\r\nendorse this effort because, in our view, the best way to\r\nrespond to crises is to spot them before they occur.\r\nConflict prevention, by definition, is the most efficient\r\napproach to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity. However, conflict prevention requires good\r\nintelligence work and analysis, and, ideally, must\r\naddress the root causes of potential conflict. Conflict-\r\nprevention measures by the United Nations must also\r\nbe undertaken in accordance with the principles of the\r\nCharter and be sensitive to the historical background of\r\nthe situations being addressed.\r\nThe Secretary-General also notes that in most\r\ncases the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations now include activities such as humanitarian\r\nrelief, disarmament, demobilization and the\r\nreintegration of combatants. This clearly demonstrates\r\nthe necessity of institutionalized coordination and\r\nconsultation between the Security Council and troop-\r\ncontributing countries, especially with respect to\r\nmandates and resource requirements.\r\nOn nuclear disarmament, we must continue\r\nworking for the universality of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Philippines is a\r\nparty to these Treaties, and recently ratified the South-\r\nEast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, thus\r\nfulfilling our constitutional requirement of keeping the\r\nPhilippines free from nuclear weapons. The\r\ninternational community must work towards\r\nimplementing the Millennium Summit decision to deal\r\nwith nuclear dangers in a comprehensive manner.\r\nThe uncontrolled spread and excessive and\r\ndestabilizing accumulation of small arms and light\r\nweapons ensure that pain, suffering and death continue\r\nthroughout the world on a daily basis. We therefore\r\nwelcome the Programme of Action of the United\r\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\r\nand Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. The Philippines\r\nhas adopted and implemented measures and explored\r\n24\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\navenues of regional and international cooperation in\r\nline with the Programme’s objectives. We thus look\r\nforward to the review of the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action, and urge Member States to heed\r\nthe Secretary-General’s call to continue to work on\r\nthose issues on which consensus could not be reached\r\nand to act upon the key recommendations of the\r\nConference.\r\nAlthough the Secretary-General’s report does not\r\nspecifically devote a section to terrorism, such actions\r\nremain a threat to international peace and security. We\r\nmust therefore urgently advance our work in the United\r\nNations on terrorism. We look forward to next week’s\r\ndebate as a catalyst for such work.\r\nWe also share the Secretary-General’s support for\r\nthe continued development of the concept of targeted\r\nsanctions so as to address the adverse effects of\r\nsanctions on innocent people.\r\nMy delegation wishes to emphasize the\r\nimportance of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nsystem and regional organizations in order to increase\r\nthe capacity of such organizations to respond to natural\r\ndisasters. At the same time, humanitarian responses to\r\nprotect civilians affected by armed conflict require the\r\nactive cooperation of the parties concerned and of\r\ninternational actors. Nevertheless, humanitarian actions\r\naddress the consequences of disasters and not their\r\ncauses. Humanitarian action should not be a substitute\r\nfor addressing the causes of a conflict.\r\nThe report’s chapter on cooperating for\r\ndevelopment echoes the Millennium Summit’s resolve\r\nto wage war on poverty, to make the right to\r\ndevelopment a reality for all, and to render\r\nglobalization inclusive and equitable. In this regard, we\r\nagree with the Secretary-General that economic growth\r\nin developing countries must accelerate if development\r\nand poverty eradication are to be achieved.\r\nWe welcome the growth in membership of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Group, with the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),\r\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) recently joining. Greater\r\ncoordination will lead to more effective delivery of\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nWe strongly believe that the financing for\r\ndevelopment process should result in a new, holistic\r\ndevelopment cooperation framework that is backed by\r\nstrong political will and adequate financial resources.\r\nWe will do our utmost to contribute to the\r\neffective implementation of the Programme of Action\r\nfor the Least Developed Countries for the decade 2001-\r\n2010. We call on the United Nations system to play a\r\ncatalytic role in mobilizing resources for the cause of\r\nAfrican development.\r\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, to be held next year, alleviating global\r\npoverty and ensuring a better future for succeeding\r\ngenerations should underscore our review of the\r\nprogress of the implementation of the commitments\r\narising from the Rio Conference.\r\nWe are glad to note that the Secretary-General\r\nprioritizes the need to promote equal opportunities for\r\npersons with disabilities. The Philippines recognizes\r\nthe responsibility to help develop their abilities and\r\nintegrate them into the mainstream of society.\r\nMy Government is also committed to advancing\r\nthe economic, social and political status and the rights\r\nof women. Gender inequality needs to be addressed in\r\nthe United Nations with a view to empowering women.\r\nThe problems encountered by women migrant\r\nworkers are also of special concern. We hope that this\r\nsession will take the appropriate action to combat\r\nviolence against women migrant workers.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report focuses on\r\nadministrative and management reform and on the\r\nbudgetary discipline of the United Nations. We support\r\nefforts to use efficiently the Organization’s human and\r\nfinancial resources, but we should not lose sight of the\r\nneed to strengthen the policy contributions of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the General Assembly, to\r\ninternational peace, security and development — hence\r\nthe importance of revitalizing the General Assembly\r\nand reforming the Security Council.\r\nFinally, last session’s resolution on the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly seeks to\r\nfacilitate the implementation of the decision contained\r\nin General Assembly resolution 51/241, which invites\r\nthe President of the General Assembly to assess our\r\ndebate on the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nwork of the Organization. We hope that the President\r\nwill be in a position to take action, as appropriate, on\r\nthis matter during this session.\r\n25\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like to extend my thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his valuable report on the work of the\r\nOrganization during the past year. I should like also to\r\ntake this opportunity to thank him for his tireless\r\nefforts in the service of the purposes and principles of\r\nthe United Nations — be they political, diplomatic or\r\nrelated to social and economic development or any\r\nother issues of great importance to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIt is not strange that the criminal terrorist attacks\r\ncommitted against the United States on 11 September\r\nshould cast a dark shadow on any international\r\ndialogue that might occur subsequently, particularly\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, because of\r\nthe expected impact they will have on the international\r\nagenda in the near future.\r\nThe problems, crises and conflicts that the\r\nSecretary-General’s report deals with — which were\r\nknown to the international community before 11\r\nSeptember — will most likely continue to be with us\r\nfor a long time. However, we cannot underestimate the\r\nrepercussions of these terrorist acts on the manner in\r\nwhich we deal — individually or collectively — with\r\nsome of these crises. This terrorist attack against a\r\nmajor global Power means, from a multilateral\r\nperspective, that there is a real structural fault in the\r\ncollective security system established by the founding\r\nfathers of the United Nations.\r\nA collective effort accompanied by serious,\r\ncreative reflection will be required in order to rectify\r\nthe situation. We will also need to intensify our efforts\r\nto address adequately the root causes of conflicts,\r\nwhich give rise to destructive terrorist attacks such as\r\nthe ones we have seen. Moreover, we must enhance our\r\nresponse and coordination in the area of conflict\r\nprevention. All of this should be done, of course,\r\nwithin the framework of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report deals with many\r\nof the crisis situations confronting the world at this\r\ntime. I should like briefly to comment on some of these\r\nissues.\r\nLet me first mention the praiseworthy efforts\r\nmade by the Secretary-General, along with other world\r\nleaders, to contain the explosive situation in the Middle\r\nEast, which is a result primarily of the continued Israeli\r\nmilitary occupation of the Palestinian territories. Egypt\r\nencourages the Secretary-General to intensify his\r\nefforts and contacts with all concerned influential\r\nparties to prevent any further escalation of the conflict\r\nin this vital region of the world, especially in view of\r\nthe extremely tense situation now prevailing.\r\nSecondly, the international community —\r\nrepresented by the United Nations system — must\r\ntranslate its stated interest in the security and stability\r\nof Africa and the prosperity of its people into specific\r\nand tangible measures that lead to concrete results. It\r\nmust also monitor and assess the effectiveness of the\r\nvarious measures that have been previously announced\r\nfor providing support to Africa.\r\nIt is also important that everyone realize that\r\nAfrica, in endorsing the New African Initiative at the\r\nLusaka Summit, has set out its priorities and devised a\r\nshort-, medium- and long-term road map for action,\r\naccording to which the international community can\r\ntake steps, within the framework of full partnership\r\nwith the countries of that continent, to translate the\r\ninterest shown in Africa into a tangible and concrete\r\nreality. This would help to extinguish the flames of\r\nconflict and promote respect for democracy and good\r\ngovernance in the African countries, as well as enable\r\nthe peoples of those countries to share in the financial\r\nand development fruits of globalization, benefits of\r\nwhich they have been deprived.\r\nThirdly, there is no doubt that human rights issues\r\nare an important cornerstone in today’s world. The\r\nSecretary-General notes in his report that a wide gap\r\nexists between human rights standards on the one hand\r\nand their implementation on the other. This is, of\r\ncourse, a matter that continues to pose a tremendous\r\nchallenge to the United Nations. In fact, this gap is of\r\nserious concern not only to the United Nations but also\r\nto the international community as a whole. This will\r\nrequire more intensive efforts to promote a wide range\r\nof human rights, so that they are not limited to civil\r\nand political rights only but also include, on an equal\r\nfooting, economic, social and cultural rights as well as\r\nthe right to development.\r\nFourthly, the Secretary-General’s report reflects\r\ninternational undertakings in the area of disarmament.\r\nParagraph 75 refers to a continuing divergence of\r\nviews among States on priorities in the field of\r\ndisarmament. We have noted this divergence in the\r\npositions of a limited number of States, among which\r\nare the five nuclear Powers.\r\n26\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nWe underscore, along with the great majority of\r\nStates, our commitment to the priorities in the field of\r\ndisarmament, as clearly reflected in the final document\r\nof the first special session devoted to disarmament,\r\nheld in 1978, in which nuclear disarmament was given\r\nabsolute priority, followed by all other weapons of\r\nmass destruction and conventional weapons.\r\nWe stress that these agreed priorities will\r\ncontinue to guide our work until the goals are achieved.\r\nHowever, we note with concern that this difference in\r\npriorities, though limited, has started to negatively\r\nimpact international efforts towards disarmament and\r\nto undermine any potential achievements in this vital\r\nfield.\r\nFifthly, my delegation emphasizes that\r\neradicating poverty and achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment for all is the joint responsibility of\r\ncountries of both the North and the South alike. While\r\nwe welcome a human rights-based approach to our\r\ncooperative effort to combat poverty, any such\r\napproach will continue to be inadequate if it is limited\r\nto the national level and disregards the international\r\nlevel or the implications of the lack of democracy in\r\nthe mechanisms of economic decision-making at the\r\ninternational level. This situation has contributed to the\r\ngrowing economic gap between States. Therefore, it is\r\nimportant that our approach be guided by what was\r\nagreed upon in the Millennium Declaration: the\r\nimportance of good governance at the national and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nSixthly, on the issue of youth employment\r\nopportunities, we are convinced that there is an urgent\r\nneed to find appropriate employment opportunities for\r\nmore than 70 million young men and women, as stated\r\nin various reports by the Secretary-General. I would\r\nlike to mention that Egypt will be hosting the Youth\r\nEmployment Summit, to be held in Alexandria in\r\nSeptember 2002, which will deal with the different\r\nmeans and strategies for providing employment for\r\nyouth. I call upon all States to contribute, through their\r\neffective participation, to making this unprecedented\r\nmeeting a success and to finding permanent and\r\npractical solutions to this problem, which has become a\r\nsource of concern for developing and developed\r\ncountries alike.\r\nThese were my delegation’s comments on some\r\nof the issues dealt with by the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization. We once\r\nmore thank the Secretary-General and the Secretariat\r\nfor their efforts in the service of Member States in\r\nrealizing the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nMr. Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\ncongratulate the President on his election, and greet\r\nand congratulate his colleagues in the Bureau.\r\nNew York and Washington, D.C., were attacked\r\nwith cruelty and insanity. The attacks were attacks on\r\nthe principles and purposes of our Organization, and on\r\nthe Inter-American System. So all the countries of\r\nAmerica, meeting in Washington recently, took\r\nmeasures to pursue, arrest, bring to justice, punish and\r\nswiftly extradite all terrorists.\r\nPeru has also called on the Inter-American\r\nSystem to adopt a convention against terrorism. Peru,\r\nwhich for over a decade has suffered the aberrations of\r\nterrorism, with 25,000 dead and thousands of millions\r\nof dollars in material damage, will always fight\r\nterrorism. The terrorist acts were among the most\r\nbrutal examples of violations of human rights,\r\ninternational law and civilized life. They were an\r\nattack on all fundamental freedoms and on the very\r\nbases of our democracies.\r\nPeru has absolutely no doubt of the urgent need to\r\ntake decisive action to eliminate terrorism through the\r\nunited efforts of the entire international community.\r\nPeru regards it as extremely important that we\r\ncomplete as soon as possible our negotiation of a\r\nUnited Nations convention against international\r\nterrorism, and that all States accede to the various\r\nsectoral conventions approved by the United Nations to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nI congratulate the Secretary-General on his report\r\nand on the important steps taken by the United Nations\r\nthis past year in discharging its responsibilities for the\r\npreservation of international peace and stability and for\r\npromoting the development and well-being of all\r\npeoples. As it has stated before, my delegation is\r\nfirmly committed to action to strengthen the United\r\nNations capacity for strategic, normative and\r\noperational planning of peacekeeping. We encourage\r\nall the efforts to achieve final consensus on the\r\nrecommendations in the Brahimi report. We hope that\r\nthis consensus will come about and that the\r\nrecommendations in the report of the Secretary-General\r\non conflict prevention will be implemented as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n27\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nWe agree on the need to move from a culture of\r\nreaction to a culture of prevention, with adequate\r\nmechanisms to deal with the root causes of conflict. We\r\nbelieve that regional and subregional approaches can\r\nbe very useful in achieving effective strategies to\r\nresolve complex emergency situations. The strategies\r\nmust have very clear foundational concepts and\r\noperational plans.\r\nWe are convinced that in order to achieve this\r\nculture of conflict prevention, we must use as\r\nefficiently as possible the limited resources available to\r\nthe Organization. We must safeguard budgetary\r\nstability, and avoid putting unsustainable financial\r\npressures to bear on poor countries. The recent revision\r\nof the scale of assessments for the apportionment of\r\npeacekeeping expenses has meant a significant increase\r\nin contributions for developing countries, including\r\nPeru.\r\nAbove all, a culture of conflict prevention means\r\nthat expenditures on weapons must be cut, that the\r\ndangers associated with arms build-ups must be\r\neliminated, and that resources must be allocated to\r\nprogressively eradicate poverty. There is no doubt that\r\nwe must make progress in that regard. We must finally\r\nbegin to engage in international cooperation on arms\r\ncontrol within the context of the United Nations. Such\r\ncooperation is also important for the world’s\r\ndeveloping regions. Peru has introduced an initiative to\r\nfreeze offensive weapons in South America, and is now\r\nholding talks with friendly countries. We believe that\r\narms control in South America is one of the elements\r\nnecessary to combat poverty.\r\nBecause of its direct relation to illicit drug-\r\ntrafficking, urban violence and the self-sustaining\r\nnature of violent conflicts, we must continue to pay\r\nspecial attention to illicit trafficking in small arms and\r\nlight weapons. The Programme of Action adopted at\r\nthe Conference held last July was certainly an\r\nimportant step forward in the right direction, but we\r\nbelieve it is the absolute minimum that must be done. It\r\nmust now be supplemented through negotiations on\r\ninternationally binding instruments that will help to\r\ntrack small arms and light weapons and to regulate\r\nbrokerage activities.\r\nThe Organization cannot — and, indeed, must\r\nnot — try to assume for itself the responsibility\r\ncountries have for building a solid foundation for their\r\ndevelopment and stability. Peru realizes that the\r\ngreatest responsibility of States is to build a dynamic\r\nand vigorous private sector and a free and democratic\r\nsociety in which there is full respect for and enjoyment\r\nof human rights, good governance, the rule of law and\r\nfree and fair elections. This belief stems from our own\r\nexperience; for, as the Secretary-General has noted, we\r\nhad to struggle to preserve our democratic order and\r\ninstitutions. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nthank the United Nations for the support given to us in\r\nthe holding of our general elections in May 2001.\r\nThere is no option other than to respect human\r\nbeings. But human rights in many parts of the world\r\nare being violated with unprecedented barbarity. We\r\nhope that the recommendations on the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict made to the Security\r\nCouncil by the Secretary-General in his report will be\r\nduly considered and implemented. We must strengthen\r\nthe international political and legal framework to\r\nprovide better protection for civilians and to ensure\r\nthat armed groups respect international humanitarian\r\nlaw.\r\nIt should be the moral and legal obligation of all\r\nMember States of the Organization to recognize that\r\nthere can be no impunity for those responsible for war\r\ncrimes or systematic violations of human rights. I am\r\npleased to announce that Peru has just ratified the\r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court,\r\ndemonstrating our strong commitment to United\r\nNations efforts to strengthen international law and\r\nprovide full protection for people’s basic freedoms and\r\nrights.\r\nThe greatest challenge facing the international\r\ncommunity in the twenty-first century is the\r\neradication of poverty. Over 4 billion men and women\r\nare today living on $2 to $3 per day. What kind of\r\nglobal market can there be under those conditions?\r\nHow can international conflicts be avoided in those\r\ncircumstances? We agree with the Secretary-General’s\r\nstatement in his report on the work of the Organization\r\nthat combating poverty involves various components,\r\nranging from improving access to social services,\r\ngender equality and respect for human rights to access\r\nto information and communications technologies. We\r\nalso agree with the Secretary-General’s comments with\r\nregard to health. It is clear that no other problem has as\r\nnegative an impact on the future of so many peoples as\r\nHIV infection and its related diseases.\r\n28\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nThe Secretary-General has described some of the\r\nencouraging measures taken by the United Nations\r\nsystem. However encouraging they might be, those\r\nactions fall very short of meeting the needs of most\r\npoor countries. Just meeting the main goals set at the\r\nMillennium Summit would require an additional $50\r\nbillion annually, another $4 billion per year for\r\nhumanitarian assistance and an extra $20 billion to\r\nmeet the needs of the world’s public works. We\r\ncertainly face an enormous challenge that can be met\r\nonly when the world begins to understand that we are\r\none human race. That will not be easy, but it is\r\nimperative.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwould like to begin my statement to the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly by giving special\r\nthanks to the Secretary-General for the preparation and\r\npresentation of his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/56/1).\r\nAt the outset, I should like to reiterate our sincere\r\nsorrow and condolences for the terrorist attack that\r\noccurred on 11 September and our solidarity with the\r\npeople and Government of the United States, victims of\r\nthe gravest assault on their security, human rights and\r\nright to peace. This event draws the attention of the\r\nUnited Nations and its membership to the need to adopt\r\nconcrete and effective measures to ensure that those\r\nwho committed and supported these terrorist acts are\r\npursued and brought to justice and that we act together\r\nto eliminate this terrible scourge of humanity and to\r\nprevent any further terrorist acts against international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn the constructive spirit that the States Members\r\nof this Organization must demonstrate at such times, I\r\nview with concern the fact that the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport does not sufficiently focus on the phenomenon\r\nof terrorism, despite its prevalence throughout the\r\nworld. I wish to stress the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report mentions terrorism in a purely\r\nmarginal way, while it ought to have contained an open\r\nand direct reference to the activities of the Secretariat\r\nand the United Nations in this regard so that mankind\r\nmay remain alert to the meaning of terrorism and the\r\nserious international threat it poses. It is clear that this\r\nscourge exists and will continue to exist. Those of us\r\nrepresenting our countries in the United Nations must\r\ndemand even more of ourselves in this task, which\r\nrequires effective tools and resources to combat.\r\nMoreover, there can be no doubt that the United\r\nNations has done important work over the past year in\r\nareas of great importance, the very pillars of its\r\nexistence, such as peace and security, as reflected in\r\nthe report. Various peacekeeping operations have been\r\nundertaken in States that have been seriously damaged\r\npolitically, economically and socially by domestic\r\nconflict. The outstanding mediating function of the\r\nSecretary-General is also highlighted in the report. In\r\nthis regard, we feel that the United Nations must\r\nenhance cooperation among its Member States and\r\nagencies, regional organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society. It must also maintain\r\nclose contact with regional and subregional entities for\r\nthe prevention of conflict and the promotion of\r\npolitical stability.\r\nThe United Nations must also reiterate the\r\ncommitment of Member States to defending, respecting\r\nand promoting human rights, which are essential to the\r\nconstruction of a peaceful world. Considerable efforts\r\nmust be made to create machinery allowing the\r\nreduction of drug consumption, which not only affects\r\nthe public health of consuming States, but also entails\r\nserious consequences for the public order of producing\r\nStates, where the illegal traffic in drugs has\r\ndestabilizing and corrupting repercussions.\r\nFurthermore, as the Security Council determined\r\nrecently under the presidency of Colombia, all Member\r\nStates should commit themselves to eradicating the\r\ndangerous abundance of small arms and light weapons\r\nthroughout the world, which imperils the national\r\nsecurity of Member States and international security.\r\nMore progress must be made in this respect, since the\r\nproliferation of and illegal trade in such weapons fans\r\nthe fires of domestic conflicts. Colombia remains\r\ncommitted to working to that end and will encourage\r\nfollow-up to the United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects, which our country chaired last July.\r\nThe Colombian Government shares the concern\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General that an immediate\r\nsolution must be found to the domestic conflict in our\r\ncountry. That is why our Government remains\r\ncommitted to finding a peaceful solution to that\r\nconflict. Last year, significant progress was made\r\ntowards that end, with the support of the international\r\ncommunity, non-governmental organizations and civil\r\nsociety and with the assistance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Adviser. The Government of\r\n29\r\nA/56/PV.8\r\nColombia has categorically and unequivocally\r\nsupported direct dialogue with those groups. Talks\r\nleading to the signing of a peace agreement have been\r\npromoted by the Government, on the basis of respect\r\nfor international humanitarian law and of the defence\r\nand promotion of human rights. My Government has\r\nmade significant efforts to reduce violations of human\r\nrights, in compliance with the norms of international\r\nhumanitarian law, international treaties and\r\nconventions and the provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter. Colombia enjoys the support of the Office of\r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights in its\r\nattempts to achieve that goal. We have also adopted a\r\nclear and determined policy against the production of\r\nand traffic in illicit drugs. We have sprayed drug crops\r\nand brought to justice those involved in that illicit\r\ntrade. Our efforts, however, require greater\r\ncommitment and solidarity on the part of the\r\ninternational community if we are to succeed and to\r\nadvance in the current peace process.\r\nMaking globalization an equitable and inclusive\r\nphenomenon is one of the greatest challenges before\r\nthe United Nations, as the Secretary-General\r\nacknowledges in his report. There can be no doubt that\r\nif the international community is to achieve its\r\nobjectives of development and eradicating poverty, as\r\nset forth in the Millennium Declaration, there must be\r\naccelerated economic development in developing\r\ncountries that have been affected by a large population\r\nincrease, inadequate social and economic development,\r\nand internal conflicts.\r\nWe must promote relevant economic, social and\r\nfinancial policies based on cooperation and solidarity.\r\nWe must strengthen support institutions nationally and\r\ninternationally and promote international machinery\r\nallowing us to undertake special measures to promote\r\ndevelopment activities in those countries, such as\r\nstrengthening agricultural policies, assistance for crop\r\nreplacement, appropriate food assistance to alleviate\r\nhunger, the provision of technical assistance with a\r\nview to facilitating the reintegration of displaced\r\npersons, and the rehabilitation of communities affected\r\nby crises by establishing social, economic and political\r\ninitiatives.\r\nThere can be no doubt that these social\r\nobjectives, an essential component of humanitarian\r\nefforts, are all implicated in the eradication of poverty.\r\nThrough its operational activities, the United Nations\r\nmust continue to provide leadership in promoting better\r\naccess to basic social services and health care. It must\r\nalso promote gender equality and the elimination of all\r\nforms of racial discrimination. It must also ensure that\r\nhuman rights are respected, facilitate the good\r\nmanagement of public affairs and expand access to\r\ninformation and communication technologies. States\r\nmust work more closely together and cooperate to\r\nensure that the humanitarian management of the\r\nOrganization is effective and efficient.\r\nI must also stress another topic that has not been\r\naddressed in the Secretary-General’s report: the\r\nfinancial situation of the Organization. An outstanding\r\nachievement was registered late last year with the\r\nnegotiation of assessments, imposing financial\r\nobligations and greater responsibilities on Member\r\nStates. New assessments were made for the regular\r\nbudget and a scale was established for the\r\npeacekeeping operation budget that did not exist\r\nbefore. Defining these scales was, without doubt, a\r\ngreat event that will require the establishment of\r\ncertain guidelines for future conduct so that our\r\nOrganization can be economically and financially more\r\nsolid.\r\nI must conclude by affirming that the United\r\nNations must continue its efforts to build a world in\r\nwhich order and justice and respect of States for\r\ninternational law prevail. I also believe that the United\r\nNations, through the Secretary-General, should\r\ncontinue its work to reduce the gap between human\r\nrights norms and their implementation and to promote\r\nthe necessary action to ensure ratification of the\r\nOrganization’s fundamental treaties on human rights.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
