(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.10 a.m.\r\nItem 41 of the provisional agenda\r\nFinal review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s: High-level plenary meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly to consider how to support the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/57/156,\r\nA/57/175)\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.2/Rev.1)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will\r\nbegin, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions\r\n56/218 of 21 December 2001 and 56/511 of 15 August\r\n2002, its high-level plenary meeting to consider how to\r\nsupport the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nI am pleased to be able to take this opportunity to\r\nmake a statement at this high-level plenary meeting.\r\nThis year, we will be conducting the final review\r\nand appraisal of the implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF). The New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa has played a very positive role\r\nin focusing the attention of the international\r\ncommunity on various aspects of development in\r\nAfrica. During the past decade, much has been\r\naccomplished and many difficult issues have been\r\naddressed, including those relating to poverty\r\neradication, sustainable development and fighting the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nMany lessons have been learned from 10 years of\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF. It has been\r\nreconfirmed that, first, conflict and development are\r\nmortal enemies; secondly, that accelerated development\r\ncooperation with Africa requires a new orientation,\r\nespecially in conducting multilateral and bilateral\r\nprogrammes; thirdly, that commitments made by the\r\nparties involved need to be honoured; fourthly, that\r\nthere is a need for sustained advocacy for African\r\ndevelopment; and lastly, and perhaps most important,\r\nthat the results of the interim evaluations carried out\r\nduring the implementation of UN-NADAF highlighted\r\nthe need for coordination and collaboration among\r\nUnited Nations agencies in their development activities\r\nin Africa.\r\nAlthough a number of corrective measures and\r\nsteps were undertaken during the implementation of the\r\nNew Agenda, not all the issues on its agenda were\r\nresolved. Africa remains a continent suffering from\r\nwidespread problems, such as extensive poverty,\r\nHIV/AIDS, inadequate access to education,\r\ndeficiencies in water distribution and insufficient\r\nsanitation. In addition to those pre-existing problems,\r\nnew challenges posed by globalization continue to\r\nemerge.\r\nWith the NEPAD initiative, a new approach has\r\nbeen set in motion. For the first time, development\r\nneeds and objectives have been identified and defined\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nby African countries themselves. The NEPAD\r\ninitiative, incorporating a complex matrix of key\r\nsocial, economic and political priorities, is a collective\r\npledge by the leaders of Africa. It is based on a\r\ncommon vision and a firm and shared belief that they\r\nhave a duty to address the development challenges\r\nfacing their individual countries and the continent as a\r\nwhole.\r\nThe discussion, concurrently, of UN-NADAF and\r\nNEPAD during the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly gives us a unique opportunity to learn from\r\nthe lessons of UN-NADAF and to outline the\r\nconditions required for the success of the new\r\ninitiative.\r\nToday, during this high-level plenary meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development, we will hear from\r\nrepresentatives of Member States, who will express\r\ntheir views on how the international community,\r\nincluding the United Nations, can participate in the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nDuring informal panel discussions in the\r\nafternoon, panellists from the countries that initiated\r\nNEPAD will relate their first-hand experiences and set\r\nout their views on the potential for cooperation\r\nbetween the African countries and the United Nations.\r\nI hope that members have a fruitful discussion,\r\nand I wish them success in their deliberations.\r\nI now give the floor to the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I am delighted to join\r\nthe Assembly for this important meeting dedicated to\r\nexploring ways in which the international community\r\ncan support the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), so as to bring the maximum\r\nbenefit to the people of Africa.\r\nThis partnership is first and foremost a\r\npartnership between African leaders and their peoples,\r\nand among States within Africa. In addition, NEPAD\r\nenvisages a new partnership between Africa and the\r\ninternational community — especially the highly\r\nindustrialized countries — based on mutual respect and\r\ninterdependence as well as on transparency and\r\naccountability, including peer review and performance\r\nmonitoring among both African countries and\r\ninternational partners.\r\nNEPAD has adopted the millennium development\r\ngoals as the centrepiece of Africa’s development\r\nagenda. I warmly welcome that decision, because I\r\nbelieve there is a symbiotic relationship between\r\nNEPAD and the millennium development goals.\r\nNEPAD will not be a success if Africa fails to achieve\r\nthe millennium development goals — and the world as\r\na whole cannot achieve the millennium development\r\ngoals unless they are achieved in Africa.\r\nTwo separate, but related, priorities — combating\r\nHIV/AIDS and promoting girls’ education — are\r\nparticularly central to achieving the millennium\r\ndevelopment goals and to realizing the promise that\r\nNEPAD holds for all of Africa. The HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic has now become the greatest threat to\r\nAfrica’s development. It is a threat not just to people’s\r\nhealth, but also, in many African countries, to the\r\nnational security and very survival of those countries.\r\nHIV/AIDS has reversed the major gains in child\r\nsurvival and socio-economic progress achieved during\r\nthe past two to three decades. It has exacerbated the\r\nproblems of poverty, discrimination, malnutrition and\r\nsexual exploitation of girls and women. It is\r\ndevastating the education system, as teachers are dying\r\nor becoming disabled more quickly than they can be\r\nreplaced.\r\nConversely, the social benefits of girls’ education\r\ninclude increased family incomes, delayed marriage,\r\nreduced fertility, lower infant and maternal mortality,\r\nbetter-nourished and healthier children, greater\r\nopportunities and life chances for women, and greater\r\nparticipation by women in political, social and\r\neconomic decision-making.\r\nBesides being key millennium development goals\r\nin their own right, the promotion of girls’ education\r\nand the control of HIV/AIDS would be the most\r\npowerful enablers for the achievement of all the other\r\nmillennium development goals in Africa.\r\nBy framing its aims around the millennium\r\ndevelopment goals, NEPAD challenges Africa’s\r\ndevelopment partners to deepen their commitment to\r\nglobal poverty reduction. NEPAD’s stated objective is\r\nto achieve the overall 7-per-cent annual growth\r\nnecessary for Africa to meet one of the millennium\r\ndevelopment goals: halving poverty by 2015. Meeting\r\nthat target requires more than doubling Africa’s recent\r\ngrowth rates.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nWhat now remains is for the principles of NEPAD\r\nto be converted into action, so that NEPAD makes a\r\nreal difference for ordinary people in Africa. The\r\nimplementation of NEPAD can benefit from two of the\r\nlessons learned by the United Nations and others\r\ninvolved in Africa’s development over the past decade.\r\nFirst, peace and security are vital to development.\r\nEconomic programmes and projects devised by the\r\nNew Partnership must be combined with real progress\r\ntowards ending conflicts and deepening the roots of\r\npeace.\r\nSecondly, development cooperation requires a\r\nnew orientation. Through NEPAD, African leaders\r\nhave shown that they consider political and economic\r\nreforms to be essential if lasting development is to be\r\nachieved. They have stressed human rights,\r\nfundamental freedoms and democracy. They have\r\nreaffirmed the importance of government with the\r\nconsent and the authority of the governed. Increasingly,\r\nAfrican leadership has itself spoken out against\r\ncorruption and bad governance, and there is a growing\r\nemphasis on ensuring accountability and transparency.\r\nThe international community must strengthen its\r\nsupport for this effort. That is what the partnership\r\nshould mean.\r\nAfrica’s future will be determined by Africans.\r\nTo build this future, to end conflicts, to cure the\r\ndiseases and to alleviate the multiple hardships that\r\nhave held it back, Africa will need all the wisdom,\r\npolitical will and creativity it can muster.\r\nIt will also need the support of the developed\r\nworld in an effort that is grounded in a sober and\r\nrealistic assessment of what needs to be done. In this\r\nage of globalization, even the richest and the most\r\npowerful countries ignore the challenges and crises of\r\nother parts of the world at their own peril. At the same\r\ntime, opportunities for growth and innovation exist\r\neverywhere — and all of us can benefit from one\r\nanother’s success. Let us make NEPAD a shining\r\nexample of this global truth.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nfirst speaker in the debate, I should like to remind\r\nmembers that, in accordance with resolution 56/511,\r\nthere will be two plenary meetings today: this\r\nmorning’s plenary meeting, until 1 p.m., and a plenary\r\nmeeting that will start at 3 p.m. and last until 7 p.m., as\r\nwell as a separate informal panel, to be held from\r\n3 p.m. to 6 p.m.\r\nAs decided by the General Assembly, the theme\r\nof the informal panel is “The international\r\ncommunity’s partnership with the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development”. The President of Nigeria will\r\norally present to the General Assembly a summary of\r\nthe discussions in the informal panel at the end of the\r\ndebate in plenary meeting.\r\nI should like to inform members that, in a letter\r\ndated 14 September 2002 and addressed to me, the\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council requests\r\nto participate in the debate on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development.\r\nIn the absence of any objection, may I take it that\r\nthe General Assembly agrees to hear a statement by the\r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council in the\r\ndebate?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The President of the Economic\r\nand Social Council will be given the floor after all\r\nMember States wishing to speak in the debate on\r\nNEPAD have done so.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, President and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the\r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria.\r\nPresident Obasanjo: This high-level meeting is\r\ntaking place at a time when we, as African leaders, are\r\nseriously addressing the issues of poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment in our continent. Essentially, we\r\nhave launched the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), an all-embracing programme\r\nof African development.\r\nNEPAD is a holistic and integrated development\r\ninitiative for the sustainable development of Africa\r\nlaunched by the Organization of African Unity, now the\r\nAfrican Union, at its summit in Lusaka in July 2001.\r\nSince then, NEPAD has received widespread\r\ninternational support, including from the G8, the\r\nEuropean Union and other developed partners. The\r\ninitiative has the following goals: the restoration of\r\npeace and security in Africa, as well as the\r\nmanagement and prevention of conflict; good\r\ngovernance; the eradication of widespread poverty and\r\nacute income disparity between the rich and the poor;\r\nthe promotion of accelerated growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment; and putting a halt to the marginalization\r\nof Africa.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nWe are aware that ownership begets\r\nresponsibility. In this regard, we, as peoples and\r\nGovernments in Africa, have resolved to take our\r\ndestiny in our own hands by drawing critical lessons\r\nfrom our past development efforts and putting such\r\nlessons to effect in the NEPAD initiative. We are\r\ndetermined to succeed in our desire to make the\r\ntwenty-first century the century of Africa.\r\nThe NEPAD partnership operates at different\r\nlevels; at the global level, between Africa and the\r\ninternational community, including multilateral\r\ninstitutions, donor agencies and development partners.\r\nIn this connection, we acknowledge the support of the\r\nG8 at its most recent Summit in Kananaskis, Canada.\r\nAt that Summit, the members approved a total of 112\r\nspecific actions that will go some way towards\r\naddressing the issues that face Africa. They also\r\npledged to assess progress in Africa at their next\r\nSummit in France in 2003.\r\nAt the regional level, NEPAD is involved in\r\nframework cooperation between African States and\r\nregional institutions in joint ventures that will\r\naccelerate the process of integration. At the subregional\r\nlevel, NEPAD is utilizing the regional economic\r\ncommunities as building blocks for growth and\r\neconomic development, all with the objective of\r\nfostering continental integration. And, at the national\r\nlevel, there is a growing partnership between the public\r\nand the non-governmental sector, such as the private\r\nsector, the informal sector and civil society,\r\nparticularly the non-governmental organizations, aimed\r\nat revitalizing public/private sector partnership, as well\r\nas a meaningful and dynamic relationship with civil\r\nsociety organizations. We also call on African civil\r\nsociety to fully embrace NEPAD and to establish\r\nstructures to promote its objectives.\r\nIn order to achieve the laudable objectives of\r\nNEPAD, a plan of action was recently adopted at the\r\ninaugural Summit of the African Union in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa. The first phase of the action plan focuses\r\non specific actions and programmes based on a three-\r\npronged strategy. First, it seeks to establish conditions\r\nfor sustainable development so as to enhance and\r\nstrengthen effective States and regional cooperation in\r\norder to enhance Africa’s competitiveness. Secondly, it\r\nidentifies and itemizes actions on priority sectors that\r\ncould speed up the integration of Africa. Thirdly, it\r\nidentifies the means of mobilizing resources from\r\nwithin and outside the continent for the effective\r\nimplementation of policies, programmes and projects.\r\nI would like to emphasize here that the\r\ndevelopment of an African Peer Review Mechanism\r\nunder NEPAD marks a revolutionary innovation in\r\nAfrica. It is essentially a system of self-assessment\r\nbased on standard and internationally accepted codes\r\nand best practices, which aims at increased\r\naccountability and transparency in our Governments. It\r\nis our decision as African leaders to be accountable to\r\nour peoples. We are not afraid to set very high\r\nstandards for ourselves, as our people expect this of us.\r\nI wish to acknowledge the noble efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General, who has worked tirelessly to\r\nmobilize support for NEPAD within the United Nations\r\nand the international community.\r\nIn our collective effort to reduce by half the\r\npopulation of Africans who are living below the\r\npoverty line by the year 2015, Africa needs about $64\r\nbillion annually to prosecute NEPAD programmes and\r\nprojects. Africa cannot bridge this resource gap alone.\r\nIt requires concerted action on the part of all of us\r\ngathered here today. One solution is to tackle the issue\r\nof external debt squarely. Africa is severely crippled by\r\nits external debt burden. Therefore, the issue of debt\r\ncancellation should be considered as part of the priority\r\naction which the continent rightly deserves. I urge\r\nmembers to join hands with us and use the NEPAD\r\ninitiative to tackle the critical issues affecting Africa.\r\nNigeria welcomes the recommendation, contained\r\nin the report of the Panel of Eminent Personalities on\r\nthe review and final appraisal of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, that the United Nations adopt NEPAD as the\r\nsuccessor policy framework for Africa’s development.\r\nThis will complement the efforts of African leaders at\r\nthe national and subregional levels. In addition, we\r\nexpect an office under the Secretary-General to\r\ncoordinate the actions of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, the United Nations Population Fund,\r\nthe World Food Programme and the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme for NEPAD, while a United\r\nNations system-wide concerted effort should allocate\r\nsenior officials from each to NEPAD. We sincerely\r\nbelieve that Africa deserves this support and trust that\r\nthe United Nations and the international community\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nwill urgently adopt measures that will add value to\r\nthese efforts.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Thabo Mbeki, President\r\nof the Republic of South Africa.\r\nPresident Mbeki: I am pleased to join the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Chairperson of the Heads of State\r\nImplementation Committee of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), President Olusegun\r\nObasanjo, in commending the New Partnership to the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAt its inaugural meeting two months ago, the\r\nAfrican Union confirmed the decision of the 2001\r\nmeeting of the Assembly of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) that the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment constitutes its programme for the socio-\r\neconomic regeneration of Africa.\r\nAccordingly, the African Union hopes that the\r\nUnited Nations will support the peoples of Africa as we\r\nengage in a historic struggle for the eradication of\r\npoverty and underdevelopment on our continent. In that\r\ncontext, I would like to express Africa’s appreciation\r\nof the adoption by the General Assembly, a decade ago,\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nThe New Partnership is designed radically to\r\nchange the paradigm that has driven international\r\nprogrammes for African development. To indicate that\r\nchange, we reaffirm that we, the Africans, are the\r\narchitects of the NEPAD renewal plan. As Africans, we\r\nnow own Africa’s development agenda.\r\nSecondly, we are determined to move forward on\r\nthe basis of a partnership among the peoples of Africa,\r\nfor the victory of the African renaissance. We are\r\nresolved to act together as Governments, as the masses\r\nwe represent and as civil society.\r\nThirdly, we seek to ensure that we move away\r\nfrom the donor-recipient relationship with the\r\ndeveloped world to a new partnership based on mutual\r\nrespect, as well as shared responsibility and\r\naccountability.\r\nFourthly, we are committed to translate our words\r\ninto a practical programme that actually changes the\r\nlives of the African masses, away from despair to a\r\ncommon future of hope and human dignity for all\r\nAfricans.\r\nThe success that we must and will achieve in\r\nAfrica will be a victory for all humanity, because the\r\npoverty of any people in any part of the globe is the\r\npoverty of all humanity.\r\nIn that context, all of us need to admit openly that\r\nwhat failed the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s was the absence of\r\nresources to translate its words into deeds. This is the\r\nchallenge to which this Assembly and this\r\nOrganization must respond, to affirm the commitment\r\nmade in the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment less than two weeks ago that the\r\nrepresentatives of the peoples of the world gathered\r\nhere are not merely sounding brass and tinkling\r\ncymbals.\r\nThe objectives and action plans enunciated in\r\nNEPAD are consistent with a part of the targets\r\ncontained in the millennium development goals, as well\r\nas those spelled out in the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation, adopted at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. It is, therefore, important\r\nthat the current process of review, re-prioritization and\r\nrealignment of UN-NADAF should take on board the\r\nobjectives and programmes of NEPAD.\r\nThe United Nations and its agencies have a\r\ncritical role to play in the implementation of the\r\nrequired programme of action. However, for the United\r\nNations to fulfil this responsibility, it will need to give\r\nitself the institutional capacity to ensure that it\r\nresponds to Africa’s challenges in an effective,\r\nefficient and coordinated way. The United Nations will\r\nhave to agree on an appropriate mechanism that will\r\nenable close monitoring of the implementation of its\r\ncollective agreements in favour of African\r\ndevelopment.\r\nToday, as Africans, we stand in front of the\r\npeoples of the world to make the pledge that we will\r\nhonour the commitment we have made to ourselves and\r\nto the world that we will act firmly to extricate Africa\r\nfrom its long night of misery.\r\nWe value the readiness of the international\r\ncommunity to enter into partnership with us, confident\r\nthat together we will end the marginalization of our\r\ncontinent, ensuring that the sun truly shines over the\r\npeoples of Africa.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nLet this be the message that issues from this high-\r\nlevel meeting of the General Assembly on NEPAD.\r\nFrom here, together, we must make the solemn\r\nstatement that Africa’s time has come.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika,\r\nPresident of the People’s Democratic Republic of\r\nAlgeria.\r\nPresident Bouteflika (spoke in French): Let me\r\nfirst congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President\r\nof this session of the General Assembly.\r\nThe present meeting, devoted to the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), bears\r\nwitness to the willingness of the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations system to be\r\nactively associated with Africa’s development process.\r\nAs members know, NEPAD is the project around which\r\nAfrica has gathered so as to take an active part in the\r\ncurrent changes, to integrate itself successfully into\r\nglobalization and to secure the command of its own\r\nfuture.\r\nThis project is the result of a long process of\r\nmaturation. It was conceived in the light of the\r\nexperience of the decades following our independence,\r\nand it thus reflects Africa’s determination to embark on\r\na new development path, the goals and course of which\r\nwill be set forth by the Africans themselves.\r\nAfrica was increasingly marginalized within the\r\nglobal economy because of the proliferation of\r\nconflicts, the spread and aggravation of poverty, and\r\nthe HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis pandemics.\r\nTherefore, it became necessary to move off the beaten\r\ntrack and identify a new approach, with new premises,\r\nbases, objectives and new steps of implementation.\r\nThrough this approach, African peoples are the masters\r\nof their development process. Peace, security,\r\ndemocracy, good governance and respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms are laid down as\r\nessential requirements for liberating peoples’ creative\r\npowers and ensuring the full integration of women and\r\nyoung people.\r\nAfrica has chosen to reform its socio-political\r\nsystems, through qualitative change in State structures,\r\nthe redistribution of responsibilities, dedication to\r\npolitical and civil-society pluralism and the promotion\r\nof partnership between public powers and all the\r\ncomponents of the society, because it has become clear\r\nto all that addressing the political dimension is a\r\nprerequisite to any viable development process.\r\nThe concept of economic development has also\r\nbeen reconsidered. It is regarded now as a multisectoral\r\nundertaking, bringing together the economic, social\r\nand ecological aspects. The private sector stands as the\r\ndriving force of economic activity and is an essential\r\nvehicle for growth. Moreover, the development\r\napproach is part of a vision of regional and continental\r\nintegration.\r\nAfrica is launching the necessary reforms in these\r\nfields in order to ensure interaction between sector-\r\nrelated policies at the domestic level and to reorganize\r\nthe regional and continental economic space.\r\nIn addition, a new international partnership is\r\nrequired, based on the principles of mutual\r\ncommitment and shared responsibility among all State\r\nand private bodies interested in such an undertaking.\r\nThis partnership aims to achieve Africa’s integration\r\ninto the globalization process, which would help to\r\nimprove the pace and stability of global economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nHence, what is at stake is to establish mutually\r\nbeneficial common interests and to build new\r\ncomplementarities by broadening and diversifying\r\neconomic relations and cooperation between Africa and\r\nits partners.\r\nMoved by a global strategy, NEPAD has defined\r\ninterdependent axes for action in priority areas for\r\nreviving African development.\r\nThe African Union has launched a process to\r\nrationalize its mechanisms for action aimed at restoring\r\npeace and security on the continent. It has decided to\r\ncreate a Council of Peace and Security and an African\r\nAcademy for Peace.\r\nThat peace endeavour, in which several African\r\nheads of State have been personally involved, will have\r\na positive impact on the continent’s stability. It implies\r\na political, financial, technical and logistical\r\ncommitment from the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations system, in order to support and\r\ncomplete the efforts of Africans in that field.\r\nPolitical and economic good governance is also at\r\nthe core of the programme. Africa has achieved within\r\nthe last few years undeniable progress towards that\r\naim. An African mechanism for peer review has\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nalready been set up. A declaration on democracy,\r\npolitical, economic and enterprise good governance has\r\nbeen drawn up on the basis of universally established\r\nnorms. The declaration will serve as a frame of\r\nreference for assessment of the state of governance in\r\nAfrica.\r\nHuman development, being the key of political,\r\neconomic and social revival, is accorded priority\r\nattention in the NEPAD programme. Measures have\r\nbeen recommended to address Africa’s tremendous\r\neducation and health challenges, where considerable\r\nefforts are made to increase the resources allotted to\r\nhuman development and to reform the educational and\r\nhealth-care system.\r\nIn order to achieve the Millennium Declaration\r\ngoals in terms of human development, further efforts\r\nare needed from Africa’s partners, particularly with\r\nregard to combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis.\r\nAgricultural and rural development, economic\r\ndiversification and environmental protection are the\r\nother basic elements of NEPAD, for which African\r\nefforts need to be backed by international cooperation.\r\nFinancial mobilization and investment are\r\nessential to the success of NEPAD goals in terms of\r\ngrowth and poverty reduction. To that end, it will be\r\nnecessary to improve the investment environment and\r\nto perfect the processes of banking, customs and fiscal\r\nrestructuring and of creating and developing financial\r\nmarkets.\r\nAfrica’s partners should contribute to the\r\nfulfilment of an integrated approach embracing trade,\r\nofficial development assistance and investment. Hence,\r\nlifting barriers in terms of access to world markets\r\nwould definitely have a motivating effect on investors.\r\nImproving official development assistance and its\r\nmodalities is also necessary as a lever to boost\r\ninvestment.\r\nFinally, creative financing mechanisms and\r\nappropriate guarantee schemes are vital for\r\nencouraging investments aimed at reducing Africa’s\r\ndeficits in infrastructure.\r\nThe dialogue begun a year ago with several\r\nofficial partners, as well as the private sector, the\r\nUnited Nations and civil society, has reaffirmed\r\nNEPAD’s solid foundation. It has already come up with\r\nideas, guidelines and initiatives to support its\r\nimplementation. In that regard, the G-8 Action Plan for\r\nAfrica constitutes a highly significant progress.\r\nWhile NEPAD is in its implementation phase, I\r\ndo not doubt that today’s meeting will take advantage\r\nof this opportunity to open prospects for a genuine\r\npartnership between Africa and the world.\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, has assured us of his full support since the\r\ninception of NEPAD. His commitment has helped\r\nmobilize the entire United Nations system and is part\r\nof his untiring action for international peace and\r\nsecurity. I wish to express to him all our gratitude and\r\nrespect.\r\nIt is now acknowledged that Africa’s\r\ndevelopment is a global necessity. Africa, in\r\ncooperation with the international community, can\r\nchange the course of its evolution. Other regions of the\r\nworld that used to face similar problems have been able\r\nto adapt to the conditions of a world marked by the\r\nmarket economy and formidable progress in science\r\nand technology. Therefore, there is no reason why\r\nAfrica cannot emerge from its isolation and\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nThe essence of NEPAD is to place Africa in a\r\nposition to meet those challenges. The ambition of\r\nNEPAD is to ensure that democracy, economic\r\nrevitalization and social progress take root in all\r\nAfrican countries. The international community cannot\r\noverlook such a commitment because it is its duty to\r\nencourage and support it.\r\nThe President: I wish to thank the President of\r\nthe People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, who is\r\nalso a former President of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Assembly will now have an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the\r\nRepublic of Senegal.\r\nMr. Wade (Senegal): The world has its eyes fixed\r\non America one year after the terrorist attacks against\r\nNew York. On behalf of the Senegalese people and on\r\nmy own behalf, I would like to express strong\r\nsolidarity with the American people.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nToday we again hear the clanking of weapons and\r\nthe rumbling of aircraft, with the threat of\r\nconfrontation between Baghdad, on the one hand, and\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nthe United States and its allies, on the other hand, and\r\nwe would like to express our viewpoint. I support all\r\nefforts for the United Nations to become involved,\r\nincluding France’s proposal to give President Saddam\r\nHussein a deadline to agree to receive and collaborate\r\nin good faith with United Nations inspectors.\r\nI am pleased to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your successful election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-seventh regular session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at one of the most crucial times in\r\nthe history of mankind, and a singular moment for\r\nachieving the development objectives in the African\r\ncontinent. I am quite convinced that, with your tact and\r\nsense of moderation you will be able to put your\r\noutstanding qualities and qualifications to the service\r\nof the noble ideals of our world institution.\r\nNaturally, I pay the same tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his exemplary and unfailing dedication to\r\nthe lofty causes of our Organization. While repeating\r\nour heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Kofi Annan, I\r\nwould like to tell him how greatly we appreciate his\r\nexcellent initiative of convoking the representatives of\r\nthe international community to urge them to support\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). In response to the alarming situation in\r\nAfrica, the international community has generously\r\nresponded to our urgent appeal.\r\nEveryone has clearly understood that NEPAD is\r\nnot just another plan but a new African vision for the\r\nfuture of our continent, a vision conceived by Africans\r\nthemselves. The New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment is a fusion of the Omega Plan, which I\r\nproposed, and the Millennium African Plan of\r\nPresident Mbeki of South Africa, President Obasanjo\r\nof Nigeria and President Bouteflika of Algeria; it has\r\nbeen generously supported by the G-8.\r\nThe base of NEPAD is three fundamental choices\r\nwhich constitute the parameters of long-term\r\ninfrastructure: good governance, large-scale recourse to\r\nthe private sector and the conception of the region as\r\nthe operating space, rather than the States, which are\r\ntoo narrow to be optimal. The new plan is centred\r\naround eight sectors, or top priorities. They are the\r\nvariables whose interplay should generate\r\ndevelopment: infrastructure, education, health,\r\nagriculture, energy, new information and\r\ncommunication technologies, the environment and\r\naccess to developed country markets combined with\r\ndiversification.\r\nFrom the G-8 summit held in Genoa, Italy, in\r\n2000 to the Kananaskis summit held in Canada last\r\nJune, NEPAD’s path has been marked with summit\r\nmeetings between G-8 and African leaders and between\r\nexperts on both sides. Thanks to both sides’\r\nunderstanding and frankness in the discussions, the\r\ninternational community is now convinced that\r\nsomething unusual is happening in Africa. It spares no\r\npraise for the African vision, the clarity of its design\r\nand the quality of its choices.\r\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to add that NEPAD is\r\nnot a compendium of requests for aid but a long-term\r\npartnership in which the real winner will be the global\r\neconomy, which will gain a partner able to participate\r\nfully in the dynamism of international trade, of whose\r\ntotal Africa currently represents only 1.78 per cent, and\r\nin the growth of the global economy, through the influx\r\nof massive investment instead of the 1 per cent it\r\ncurrently receives.\r\nThe unique purpose of this high-level meeting is\r\nto invite the international community to support\r\nNEPAD. With the world summits in Monterrey,\r\nMexico, in March 2001, in Dakar, Senegal, with the\r\nprivate sector in April 2001, and in Johannesburg in\r\nJuly 2002, on sustainable development and its links to\r\nthe environment, the cycle is completed; only action\r\nremains. In all sectors, regional projects have been duly\r\nidentified. It only remains to decide by whom and how\r\nthey will be financed — through the participation of\r\nAfricans, public resources from our partners and the\r\nprivate sector.\r\nA broad consensus has been reached on this\r\npoint; it favours the private sector as the only sector\r\ncapable of providing the immense resources that Africa\r\nrequires. We will then be able to minimize the number\r\nof political meetings and preparatory events in favour\r\nof working meetings for the selection of priorities and\r\ntheir financing.\r\nI would therefore like to include in my statement\r\na message comprised of several points. First, I am\r\nconvinced that the G-8 leaders and the private sector\r\nhave deeply committed themselves to Africa, to help\r\nthe continent enter the phase of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, above all through good governance, and\r\nalso through heavy infrastructure investment and\r\ninvestment in the production of goods and services in\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nall sectors for domestic consumption and international\r\ntrade, which — I would recall — is the motor of\r\ngrowth.\r\nOn the other hand, we must recognize that efforts\r\ntowards good public and private governance are\r\nproliferating in Africa through the fight against\r\ncorruption and illicit funds. In my region of West\r\nAfrica, the outcome of legislative and presidential\r\nelections in Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and the Gambia have\r\nnot been disputed by opposition parties, which have\r\ngenerally accepted the results. That would have\r\nunthinkable a short time ago.\r\nThe peer review system has not yet been applied\r\nin its strict sense, but the heads of State of West Africa\r\nwill review the situation of children in the subregion,\r\nwith the assistance of eminent persons of the United\r\nNations system. The expected high-level and important\r\ninvolvement demonstrates that adults attach as much\r\nimportance to meetings on children as they do to\r\nsummits among great leaders. We hope that the\r\nSecretary-General, despite his vast responsibilities at\r\nthis crucial moment in history, will grace the event\r\nwith his important presence, although his absence\r\nwould be well understood.\r\nGiven the positive steps taken by our\r\ndevelopment partners, I hope that the pace of the use of\r\ncredits will be accelerated; this is unfortunately often\r\nimpeded by the lack of expert staff in our\r\nadministrations, and by the variety of eligibility and\r\ndisbursement procedures. The lack of experts, which in\r\npart explains the problems with use of credits in\r\nSenegal — and probably elsewhere, as well — could\r\nbe compensated for either through the return of\r\nexpatriate Africans, who constitute an important source\r\nof expertise in the developed countries, or by making\r\nconsultants temporarily available to our States.\r\nTo my African compatriots, I will recall what has\r\nbecome obvious: humankind is at the heart of\r\nsustainable development in all its phases and\r\nthroughout its duration. That is to say once more that\r\nthe speed at which our continent will be developed is\r\ndirectly related to education and training. That means\r\nthat raising education budgets in the area of 60 to 65\r\nper cent — a figure still lower than those of the Asian\r\ntigers — would not be excessive. South-East Asia has\r\nshown that belt-tightening is worth the effort in order\r\nto create the authentic actors and promoters of\r\ndevelopment. On our web sites, expatriate African\r\nprofessionals will find all the information on NEPAD\r\nand can obtain answers to their questions.\r\nThe various social groups and civil society must\r\nnot wait for the initiators of NEPAD to tell them their\r\nplace in the widely-shared African vision of NEPAD.\r\nIndividually and collectively, they must interpret\r\nNEPAD at their own level and apply it in the daily\r\nbehaviour and activities.\r\nI would tell the private sector that all the\r\nconditions are being met for it to invest in Africa, just\r\nas it has invested in Europe, the United States, Japan\r\nand now in the emerging countries of Asia and Latin\r\nAmerica.\r\nI will end where I began. Africa has, with a few\r\nexceptions, embarked upon the path of good\r\ngovernance. Without doubt, it is still taking its first\r\nsteps, but it is important to accelerate the pace and not\r\nto go backwards. The general pace must reflect\r\nmoderation. There will, no doubt, still be difficulties,\r\nbut we must persevere with resolve and determination.\r\nWe must above all implement the peer review\r\nmechanism courageously and without any complacency\r\nas it is the starting point of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nPresident Kufuor: We have come here as a new\r\ngeneration of African leadership committed to the\r\nwelfare of our people, and to seeing Africa restored to\r\nits place of dignity among the comity of nations. We\r\nhave changed the nature of the debate on Africa’s\r\ndevelopment in our own countries and in the\r\ninternational arena. No longer must our policies be\r\nsimply responses to conditionalities imposed from the\r\noutside or to uncontrollable pressures generated\r\ninternally. We are committed to good governance, to\r\nzero tolerance of corruption, to democratic freedoms\r\nand political tolerance, to inclusive policies and\r\nconflict prevention. The sound management of our\r\neconomies and respect and support for the private\r\nsector are critical. That is because the private sector\r\nworks best for creating wealth and attracting more\r\nsustained foreign direct investment. We seek to develop\r\nour continent in partnership with the rest of the world,\r\nin a spirit of dialogue and cooperation. This\r\nopportunity to reflect on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) in the United Nations,\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nthe embodiment of global cooperation for peace and\r\ndevelopment, is therefore timely. We recall that the\r\nGroup of Eight industrialized countries (G-8) have\r\nalready signalled, at their last summit, support for\r\nNEPAD. Prior to this, the international community,\r\nincluding the international financial institutions, had\r\nalso expressed support for it.\r\nWe believe that this convergence of views on the\r\nimportance of NEPAD to Africa’s development augurs\r\nwell for the people of Africa. Such an important shift\r\nof policy approach must, however, not remain a mere\r\nstatement of support. It must be evidenced in practical,\r\ntimely and concrete terms.\r\nWe, the African leaders, should commit ourselves\r\nto ensure that the Peer Review Mechanism works, and\r\nthat no leader is allowed to hide under the umbrella of\r\nsolidarity, or any other excuse when he or she fails to\r\nmeasure up to the principles underlying NEPAD. Our\r\npeople deserve good leaders if they are to realize the\r\ndream of progress that inspired our struggle for\r\nindependence.\r\nThe need to ensure balance in the enforcement of\r\nthe principles of NEPAD is, perhaps, as important as\r\nensuring good governance. We must take account of\r\nthe fact that some African countries may have to go\r\nthrough a period of transition before they will be able\r\nto fully implement the principles of NEPAD. During\r\nthis period of transition, care should be taken not to\r\nimpose sanctions that might gravely destabilize entire\r\ncommunities, regions and neighbouring countries. To\r\nattain this balance, Africa and its partners need to\r\ncollaborate better under the auspices of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is also important that we focus at the global\r\nlevel, on a number of issues that are critical in creating\r\nthe conditions for Africa’s development.\r\nMaking Africa’s local entrepreneurs a vital\r\nbedrock for expanded investments and thriving markets\r\non the continent, requires not just the policy and\r\nregulatory environment that we as African\r\nGovernments must provide, but it also requires access\r\nto substantial volumes of long-term concessionary\r\ncredit and venture capital.\r\nThere is also the need to assure Africa levels of\r\nsupport that will enable the continent to provide social\r\nsafety nets to sustain the minimum acceptable\r\nstandards of health, education and nutrition for all,\r\nirrespective of social standing.\r\nThirdly, there are many other bottlenecks in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. These include the crippling\r\ndebt burden, declining levels of official development\r\nassistance, limited market access and the lack of trade\r\nand investment insurance. These bottlenecks must be\r\naddressed urgently.\r\nThe eyes of the people of Africa are on us today.\r\nFor so long they have heard pledges and promises from\r\ntheir leaders and their development partners, and they\r\nhave seen those promises broken.\r\nWe appeal to this Organization, and through it to\r\nthe world, to seize this opportunity to work together\r\nwith Africa to implement NEPAD, which is our\r\nframework for achieving the vision of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency El Hadj Omar Bongo, the\r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic.\r\nPresident Bongo (spoke in French): In the\r\ncontemporary world nothing that happens in one place\r\ngoes without having an effect elsewhere. At a time of\r\nglobalization, we must set sharing, partnership and\r\nsolidarity as the watchwords for relations among the\r\npeoples of the world. They must organize the\r\nexchanges within the international community in all\r\nareas of human activity.\r\nI am gratified by the welcome given to the\r\nAfrican initiative of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) by the international\r\ncommunity, and particularly by the countries of the\r\nGroup of 8. This welcome reflects heightened interest\r\nand new respect for Africa, which is the very essence\r\nof our initiative. We also owe it to the tremendous\r\nwork accomplished by the Presidents of Algeria,\r\nNigeria, Senegal, and South Africa, who have spoken\r\nso eloquently.\r\nA new initiative and the fruit of collective\r\nawareness, NEPAD brings the full responsibility of\r\nleaders and the peoples of Africa to bear. This\r\ndemonstrates even more that NEPAD transcends\r\ntraditional concepts of aid to move towards the concept\r\nof active and dynamic partnership.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nWith NEPAD, Africa is giving the international\r\ncommunity that wishes truly to participate in\r\ndevelopment, the ways and means to do so in a\r\nmutually beneficial partnership.\r\nTime is of the essence. We must work together to\r\nachieve sustainable development. There are meetings\r\nthat must not be missed and opportunities that must be\r\nseized at all costs. Personally, I am still going to wait\r\nand see. I am looking forward to seeing the\r\ninternational community and external financial\r\nstakeholders work together with us, inshallah, to set up\r\nNEPAD projects, particularly since these collective\r\nconcrete projects will bring progress and well-being to\r\nthe peoples of Africa.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency the Right Honourable Jean\r\nChrétien, the Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMr. Chrétien (Canada): Thank you for your\r\ninitiative in bringing the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment before this Assembly. NEPAD has been\r\nbrought before the General Assembly because it has the\r\npotential to mark a global turning point, a turning point\r\nin the relationship among African States and in that of\r\ndeveloped nations with Africa.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nAbove all, NEPAD has the potential to mark a\r\nturning point of hope for the people of Africa, one that\r\ncould bring an end to generations of social and\r\neconomic decline. The New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) was created by Africans for\r\nAfricans. It sets out unique African responses to deep-\r\nrooted and continent-wide challenges. But all Member\r\nStates have a role to play in ensuring that the NEPAD\r\nvision becomes a reality.\r\nIndeed, all Member States can draw inspiration\r\nfrom that vision: from its recognition that peace,\r\nsecurity, democracy, good governance, human rights,\r\nand sound economic management are conditions for\r\nsustainable development; from its identification of the\r\npromotion of the role of women as one of two principal\r\nlong-term objectives; from its frank acknowledgement\r\nthat the spread of diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, stands\r\nto undermine the gains being made in human\r\ndevelopment; and, from the personal and specific\r\ncommitment of progressive African leaders to hold\r\neach other accountable for delivering on the NEPAD\r\nvision of hope.\r\nCanada looks upon this debate as instrumental to\r\nmaking NEPAD a centrepiece of the United Nations\r\nagenda and we are committed to doing our part.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nLast June it was my great privilege to chair the\r\nGroup of 8 (G-8) Summit, where Africa and NEPAD\r\nwere the centrepiece of our agenda. Indeed, we were\r\njoined by several of the visionary African leaders who\r\ncreated NEPAD and who are with us here today. The\r\nG-8 leaders adopted an ambitious Africa Action Plan in\r\nsupport of NEPAD. We identified resources to deliver\r\nunder the Action Plan. We put in place a follow-up\r\nprocess to ensure the effectiveness of the measures\r\nplanned. And I know full well that my successor as G-8\r\nChair, President Chirac, shares my commitment to\r\nAfrica.\r\nTaken together, NEPAD and the G-8 Africa\r\nAction Plan stand to transform the relationship between\r\nG-8 Governments and those in Africa that are seeking\r\nto implement NEPAD. The time has come to go from\r\ntalking to action, now that we have an action plan for a\r\nnew partnership.\r\nFor African nations, this means giving life to\r\nNEPAD. African countries that will implement NEPAD\r\nin all of its aspects, including good governance, will\r\nenjoy enhanced assistance from the industrialized\r\nworld. For G-8 partners, this means giving effect to the\r\nspecific commitments contained in the Africa Action\r\nPlan. We must also ensure that all of our policies and\r\nactions reinforce those commitments, including the\r\npositions we will take in the Doha trade negotiations.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFor the developed world as a whole,\r\nimplementing NEPAD means making development\r\nassistance more effective and doing more to ensure that\r\nwe are open to business with Africa. For business\r\nworldwide, this means re-evaluating commercial\r\nopportunities in Africa as the new economic conditions\r\nthat NEPAD seeks to create take hold, and\r\nreconsidering the stereotype, all too deeply rooted, that\r\ninvesting money in Africa does not pay.\r\nFor Canada, the process of implementing the G-8\r\nAfrica Action Plan began on the very day in June that\r\nit was adopted. We announced that, within our fiscal\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nframework, Canada was committing $6 billion in new\r\nand existing resources over five years to support\r\nAfrican development. We intend to double our\r\ndevelopment assistance from current levels by 2010. At\r\nleast half of that increase will be earmarked for Africa.\r\nWe have reaffirmed our commitment to untie Canadian\r\naid. We announced that, as of 1 January 2003, Canada\r\nwill eliminate tariffs and quotas on almost all products\r\nfrom the least developed countries.\r\nAgricultural subsidies in rich nations remain a\r\nfundamental obstacle to African development. The\r\nannual level of all official development assistance from\r\ndeveloped countries amounts to $50 billion. Subsidies\r\nby these same countries for their domestic agriculture\r\nexceed $350 billion annually. These huge supports put\r\na strain on treasuries, depress prices and effectively\r\nshut out producers from developing countries. Canada\r\ncalls on developed nations to make the elimination of\r\nsuch subsidies a top priority.\r\nNEPAD is about coming to terms with the fact\r\nthat the continued marginalization of Africa from the\r\nglobalization process and the social exclusion of the\r\nvast majority of its peoples are profoundly contrary to\r\nthe global interest. Helping Africa get on its feet is in\r\nour interest from the perspective of our common\r\nhumanity and from the perspective of creating a more\r\nprosperous world with new markets. It is profoundly in\r\nour self-interest from the point of view of our own\r\nsecurity. We have seen right here in New York the\r\ntragic consequences that can result from failed States in\r\nfaraway places. Simply put, we cannot afford not to\r\naddress these issues. This is the time to act. NEPAD is\r\nthe blueprint. The rest is simply a matter of political\r\nwill.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Right Honourable Mr. Pakalitha\r\nB. Mosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for Defence\r\nof Public Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): Abject poverty,\r\nbackwardness and ignorance that afflict the majority of\r\nour African populations have triggered new thinking on\r\nthe part of African leaders, who have resolved to\r\ndevelop a deliberate and strategic approach to ensure\r\nAfrica’s socio-economic and political advancement.\r\nThus, NEPAD has been a product of this common\r\nvision and shared conviction by us Africans.\r\nNEPAD encourages good governance, respect for\r\nthe rule of law and human rights, and this can only be\r\nrealized where democracy is the order of the day,\r\nwhich is also a sine qua non for economic growth and\r\nsustainable development. The basis for these noble\r\nideals is the notion of the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism, to which African leaders are to voluntarily\r\nsubmit themselves within the NEPAD framework.\r\nNEPAD calls for African countries individually and\r\ncollectively to embark on development strategies that\r\nwill eradicate poverty and ensure sustainable growth\r\nand development in Africa.\r\nAs I said, the underlying notion for NEPAD is\r\ngenuine partnership between African countries and the\r\ninternational community, based on shared\r\nresponsibility and mutual interest. In the long run,\r\nNEPAD seeks to reverse the marginalization of Africa\r\nowing to the globalization process, as well as the social\r\nexclusion of its 340 million people, who are currently\r\nliving on less than $1 per day.\r\nNEPAD recognizes the role of the private sector\r\nin the development processes of Africa. The\r\nmobilization of the requisite domestic resources for\r\nreinvestment into key sectors such as infrastructure,\r\ninformation and technology, human resource\r\ndevelopment, agriculture and market access is\r\ndependent on a healthy and economically functioning\r\nprivate sector.\r\nWe are, however, cognizant of the gap that exists\r\nbetween the least developed countries and the\r\nindustrialized countries in terms of resource\r\ndistribution and technological know-how. We therefore\r\ncall upon the latter countries to complement our efforts\r\nin order to achieve the objectives of NEPAD.\r\nI must hasten to dispel the misunderstanding that\r\nexists about the relationship between the African Union\r\nand NEPAD. To my delegation, NEPAD is an African\r\nUnion programme. The African Union serves as the\r\napex of the institutional framework for African socio-\r\neconomic and political development so that Africa can\r\nultimately extricate itself from the bondage of\r\nmarginalization and exclusion in the globalizing world.\r\nTo that end, we call upon the United Nations system to\r\ncoordinate and synchronize activities related to the\r\nNEPAD plan of action, while the international\r\ncommunity plays its supportive role in ensuring the\r\nsuccess of NEPAD and providing renewed impetus for\r\nthe development of Africa.\r\nAfrica has learned a painful but useful lesson\r\nfrom the implementation of the United Nations New\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF). My delegation recalls that the\r\nevaluation of UN-NADAF’s performance revealed,\r\namong other things, that the envisaged growth rate of 6\r\nper cent for Africa was never achieved and that,\r\ninstead, official development assistance declined by 33\r\nper cent. To my delegation, the NEPAD targets are not\r\nvery different from those under UN-NADAF, except in\r\nterms of ownership of the programme. It is therefore\r\nour strong conviction that the conclusions in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the evaluation of UN-\r\nNADAF are correct. My delegation therefore welcomes\r\nthat report and requests the Secretary-General to ensure\r\nits implementation, particularly with regard to section\r\nthree, which provides an incisive analysis of how the\r\nUnited Nations intends to support the implementation\r\nof NEPAD.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation welcomes the\r\nrecently adopted G-8 Africa Action Plan. As much as\r\nthe Action Plan is undoubtedly a valuable and living\r\nframework for a new partnership between Africa and\r\nthe G-8, we appeal to the G-8 to observe the spirit of\r\nNEPAD, which emphasizes partnership between\r\nAfrican countries and the international community.\r\nMembers of the international community should be\r\nmore supportive and explicit in outlining, in concrete\r\nterms, the details of their commitment to NEPAD.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick\r\nMwanawasa, President of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nPresident Mwanawasa: On behalf of my\r\ndelegation, allow me to thank you, Mr. President, for\r\norganizing a special session specifically to discuss\r\nAfrica’s new economic initiative, the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). This initiative\r\nemerged from the realization of the increasing poverty\r\nlevels of the peoples on the continent and their\r\nmarginalization at the global level. As all of us are\r\naware, high levels of poverty lead to political\r\ninstability, which in turn leads to more poverty and\r\nunder-development, thereby perpetuating a vicious\r\ncircle of impoverishment and social alienation. NEPAD\r\nis therefore a plan for the socio-economic development\r\nof the African continent.\r\nIn the year 2000, the leaders of the world adopted\r\nand committed themselves to the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. For the continent of\r\nAfrica, efforts were made in the past to break the\r\nvicious circle Africa finds itself in. A number of\r\ninitiatives were put in place, both at the regional and\r\ninternational levels. At regional level, we have the\r\nCairo Plan of Action, the Abuja Treaty and the Lagos\r\nPlan of Action, just to name a few. At the international\r\nlevel, we had the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), the\r\nLomé Cotonou Agreement, the African Growth\r\nOpportunity Act (AGOA), the Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development (TICAD), the\r\nGroup of 8 Okinawa Declaration of 2001 and the G-8\r\nAfrica Action Plan, recently adopted at Kananaskis,\r\nCanada, in July 2002.\r\nThe critics of the NEPAD initiative question the\r\ndifference it will make, given that even with the\r\ninitiatives previously put in place in Africa, the\r\ncontinent’s poverty is increasing. The answer is self-\r\nexplanatory. NEPAD is different from its predecessors\r\nbecause it is a holistic, comprehensive and integrated\r\nstrategic framework for the social and economic\r\ndevelopment of Africa. The NEPAD document\r\nprovides a vision for Africa, a statement of the\r\nproblems facing the continent and a programme of\r\naction to resolve clearly identified problems in order to\r\nrealize the vision for a bright future by the peoples of\r\nAfrica.\r\nIt is also different from its predecessors in that it\r\nis a plan conceived and developed by African leaders.\r\nThe primary objective of NEPAD is to eradicate\r\npoverty in Africa; to place African peoples, both\r\nindividually and collectively, on a path of sustainable\r\ngrowth and development; and to halt the\r\nmarginalization of Africa in the global process. Zambia\r\nis confident that, with the political will of the African\r\nleaders, the continent can break the shackles of poverty\r\nthrough the implementation of the NEPAD programme\r\nof action. The implementation of priority sectoral plans\r\nsuch as those aimed at bridging the infrastructure gap\r\nand developing human resources, and those relating to\r\nagriculture, manufacturing and science and technology,\r\nare the goals Africa has set for itself under NEPAD.\r\nWhile it is recognized that this new initiative is\r\nput forward by the Africans and is for the Africans\r\nthemselves to implement, we cannot ignore the\r\nimportance of assistance from the international\r\ncommunity through increased official development\r\nassistance and by the United Nations system. Africa\r\nwill still need debt relief, foreign direct investment and\r\nofficial development assistance in addition to domestic\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nresource mobilization by the African countries\r\nthemselves. I therefore wish to welcome the positive\r\nbilateral and multilateral support already shown for\r\nNEPAD.\r\nWe should also not lose sight of the importance of\r\nSouth-South cooperation, which extends to other\r\ndeveloping countries outside Africa. I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to appeal to other developing\r\ncountries to extend their support to NEPAD as they\r\nhave done with other initiatives on Africa. We are\r\nlooking forward to practical support as we move ahead\r\nwith the implementation of the initiative.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to appeal to my fellow\r\nAfrican leaders to commit ourselves to the goals and\r\nobjectives we have set for ourselves for the good and\r\nthe betterment of our peoples. The ball is in our court,\r\nand we should maintain the political will we have\r\nshown so far on NEPAD. If we show commitment to\r\nour initiative, the international community will support\r\nour efforts. In unity, we shall succeed.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Festus G. Mogae, MP,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana.\r\nPresident Mogae: I am delighted to take part in\r\nthe deliberations of this special session devoted to the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nIt is comforting that this high-level plenary\r\nmeeting is taking place in the final stages of the review\r\nand appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa (UN- NADAF). NEPAD\r\nand the United Nations Development Agenda for\r\nAfrica must be mutually reinforcing processes.\r\nNEPAD represents a strategy for addressing the\r\nissues of peace and security, democratic and\r\naccountable governance, poverty eradication and\r\nobservance of the rule of law, all of which are included\r\nin the Millennium Declaration. The achievement of\r\nNEPAD’s goals would contribute meaningfully to a\r\nmore just and more secure global environment.\r\nNEPAD is an embodiment of the African leaders’\r\ndetermination to deal decisively with Africa’s\r\neconomic and political problems. It is an undertaking\r\nby leaders to ensure a climate conducive to sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The NEPAD framework recognizes the\r\ncardinal role that development stakeholders such as\r\nGovernments, political leaders, labour, the private\r\nsector, non-governmental organizations, civil society\r\nand the international community have to play in the\r\ndevelopment process.\r\nNEPAD is a multifaceted partnership in which\r\nkey players have to deliver on their obligations.\r\nNEPAD does not place the onus for the raising of the\r\nliving standards of the African people on official\r\ndevelopment assistance, although it recognizes its\r\ncatalytic role in the early phases of the turnaround.\r\nNEPAD is being criticized, even from within\r\nAfrica. This is yet another manifestation of the\r\ndemocratic tide sweeping through the continent. Some\r\nof the criticisms will contribute to sharpening\r\nNEPAD’s programmes. To the dogmatic opponents of\r\nNEPAD, who see red when they think Africa is relating\r\ntoo closely with the international community — which\r\nthey blame for all of Africa’s present maladies — I can\r\nonly say that they should come up with viable\r\nalternatives. Even then, isolationism is not an option in\r\ntoday’s increasingly interdependent world, and no one\r\nshould provide solace to Afro-pessimists.\r\nNEPAD should not be judged by isolated\r\nepisodes but by the general advancement of the\r\nmajority of the inhabitants of the African continent. It\r\nis obviously unrealistic to expect all countries to attain\r\nthe same goals overnight. It is equally unfair to hold\r\nthe entire NEPAD programme to ransom on account of\r\ndevelopments in a few countries.\r\nWithout the support of the international\r\ncommunity, NEPAD cannot successfully resolve some\r\nof Africa’s intractable problems, such as intra-State and\r\ncross-border conflicts, the debilitating external debt,\r\ndeclining levels of official development assistance, the\r\nwidening digital divide, and, above all, the restricted\r\naccess of African products to developed-country\r\nmarkets.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to the Group of Eight\r\nleaders for their G-8 Africa Action Plan and continuous\r\nconstructive engagement in the NEPAD Agenda. I\r\nimplore the rest of the international community to\r\nfollow their example and to make concrete\r\ncommitments to support the revitalization of the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nIn this regard, this special session should lead to\r\nmore determined efforts by the United Nations system\r\nto play its part not only directly, but also by acting as a\r\ncatalyst for a global compact on Africa’s development.\r\nOver the years, developing nations have counted on the\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\ngoodwill and unwavering support of the United\r\nNations to advance the cause of the poor and the\r\nvoiceless, and Africa is no exception. We shall\r\ncontinue to count on the solidarity of the United\r\nNations system.\r\nI wish to appeal to the international community to\r\nrally behind NEPAD and the African Union in the war\r\nagainst poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy,\r\nunemployment and underdevelopment.\r\nWe Africans reaffirm our commitment to\r\nupholding high standards of political, economic and\r\ncorporate governance and of democratic and\r\naccountable rule, and, above all, to respecting the\r\nhuman rights of those we govern. Raising the living\r\nstandards of the African people is an urgent matter. The\r\ncontinued underdevelopment of Africa denies many of\r\nour peoples the basic necessities of life, as well as\r\nhuman rights and dignity, all of which are at the core of\r\nthe United Nations mandate. This is not the time for\r\nideological pronouncements, but for action — and\r\naction speaks louder than words.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear a statement by His Excellency Mr. José Maria\r\nPereira Neves, Prime Minister of the Republic of Cape\r\nVerde.\r\nMr. Neves (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): I would like\r\nto start by praising the decision of the United Nations\r\nto dedicate a special session of the General Assembly\r\nto the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), thus providing an interactive dialogue at the\r\nhighest level on the combination of efforts aimed at\r\nassuring the success of this venture.\r\nLikewise, I would like to congratulate the African\r\nheads of State present here today, who in the\r\nframework of the African Union undertook this\r\ninitiative as well as the responsibility of shaping a\r\nrealistic vision for Africa’s development. It is a vision\r\nthat reflects the will and determination to break away\r\nfrom the practices and dependencies that have held\r\nback Africa’s development and the realization of the\r\ncontinent’s great potentials for the benefit of its\r\ncitizens. NEPAD translates the deep beliefs of a\r\ncontinent, which, supported by a strong decision to act,\r\ntakes on the hope of reversing the fatalism of its\r\ndestiny by relaunching itself on the path of\r\ndevelopment, thereby assuming its rightful position in\r\nthe community of nations.\r\nThe broad and favourable support received by the\r\nproject at the international level, namely the backing of\r\nthe United Nations, the European Union, the Group of\r\n8, the Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment (TICAD) and many other international\r\nbodies, contributes to strengthening the expectations\r\nthat a genuine partnership can be created between\r\ndeveloped nations and Africa. This partnership should\r\nbe based on mutual interests and benefits, shared\r\ncommitments and reliable agreements in which the\r\nprivate sector is assured a crucial role. We are well\r\naware that much has to be done in order to fulfil these\r\nnoble objectives. Past experiences should guide us with\r\nprudence to choose realistic paths and solutions that\r\nboth respond to the interests of all parties — namely,\r\nthose of the peoples of our countries — and respect the\r\nenvironment.\r\nWe are also aware of existing concerns from\r\ndifferent quarters that need to be addressed if we do not\r\nwant to run the risk of losing the consensus that is\r\nindispensable for the success of this vital project. For\r\nthis reason, it is essential to engage civil society in a\r\npermanent dialogue to refine the principles and\r\nobjectives of NEPAD in order to ensure the ownership\r\nof the Partnership by the people themselves, and not\r\nonly by the elites. Moreover, while NEPAD is a\r\ndevelopment initiative based primarily on a partnership\r\nbetween Africa and the developed world, it is\r\nimportant to engage major players from the South, to\r\ntap the enormous potentials and wealth of their\r\nexperiences and to promote South-South cooperation in\r\nsupport of NEPAD.\r\nThe recent Summit in Johannesburg clearly\r\ndemonstrated that the world is becoming increasingly\r\nconscious of the peculiar conditions of small island\r\nStates and the challenges they are confronted with.\r\nThey have to cope with their vulnerabilities and face\r\naccrued responsibility in preserving environmental\r\nbalances and, because of their strategic situation, in\r\ncombating organized crime and terrorism. Similarly, at\r\nthe level of the multilateral trade system, there is an\r\nincreasing awareness that the imbalances and\r\ninequalities affecting developing island nations should\r\nbe corrected and that effective support is necessary so\r\nthat they can actively integrate themselves into the\r\nglobal economy.\r\nThe extreme vulnerability of insular economies,\r\nwhich magnifies at the local level the disturbances\r\nexperienced in international markets, is an element that\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\ncannot be overlooked. Cape Verde is an island nation\r\nwhose small area, dispersion among numerous islands\r\nand geographic remoteness are aggravated by its\r\nexposure to climatic factors that permanently place its\r\necosystem at risk. The country’s development is\r\nstrongly conditioned by the high costs of insularity and\r\nthe impossibility of taking advantage of economies of\r\nscale.\r\nCape Verde thus advocates that NEPAD’s strategy\r\nshould contemplate the particularities of island\r\ncountries, which entail inherent features and fragilities\r\nthat hamper them and sometimes make participation in\r\nmajor regional infrastructure projects unfeasible. In\r\naddition, NEPAD should support international\r\ninitiatives favouring small island developing States,\r\nnamely, the Barbados Programme of Action, and work\r\nin close cooperation with their Governments to reduce\r\nthe negative effects of insularity. My Government\r\nwould like to express its full readiness to actively\r\nparticipate in discussions leading to the preparation of\r\na strategy for the synchronized integration of island\r\nStates in the great continental NEPAD project. In that\r\nregard, Cape Verde hopes next year to host an\r\ninternational meeting dedicated specifically to defining\r\nthe outlines of participation by island States in the\r\nNEPAD project.\r\nWith the launching of NEPAD, we are faced with\r\na unique opportunity to reverse the destiny of, and\r\nbuild a prosperous future for, millions of women and\r\nmen throughout the continent. It is up to us, as leaders,\r\nto build trust among our citizens and to assure them\r\nthat we will work tirelessly so that they become the\r\nmain beneficiaries of the enormous potentials existing\r\nin our continent.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to\r\nthe next speaker, I should like to bring to the attention\r\nof the General Assembly two organizational matters.\r\nIn view of the large number of speakers inscribed\r\non the list of speakers — 80 so far — and in order to\r\nallow the Assembly to listen to all the speakers today,\r\nit is the intention of the President of the Assembly to\r\nstrictly enforce the five-minute time limit on\r\nstatements.\r\nUnless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the\r\nAssembly agrees to proceed in this fashion.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In that connection, a light\r\nsystem has been installed at the speaker’s rostrum that\r\nfunctions as follows: a green light will be activated at\r\nthe start of a speaker’s statement; an orange light will\r\nbe activated 30 seconds before the end of the five\r\nminutes; and a red light will be activated when the\r\nfive-minute limit has elapsed. I appeal to speakers to\r\ncooperate in observing the five-minute time limit for\r\ntheir statements so that all those inscribed on the list of\r\nspeakers can be heard within the time allocated to us\r\ntoday.\r\nAlso, given that delegations have had ample time\r\nto inscribe their names on the list of speakers, I should\r\nlike to propose that the list of speakers for the debate\r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development be\r\nclosed this morning at 11.30 a.m. Our meeting this\r\nmorning will be extended to 1.30 p.m. Unless I hear\r\nany objection, I shall consider that the Assembly\r\nagrees to this proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Jan Petersen,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Norway.\r\nMr. Petersen (Norway): The creation by African\r\nleaders of the African Union and the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) opens up an\r\nhistoric opportunity for Africa to take control of its\r\nown destiny. These events bear witness to the new\r\nresolve and commitment African leaders are showing\r\nin shaping the future of their continent. NEPAD offers\r\na clear-sighted vision for Africa’s future.\r\nThe challenges facing Africa are enormous and\r\ndiverse, as the Millennium Declaration clearly\r\nrecognizes. The States of Africa have peoples who\r\nspeak over 1,000 languages. Their cultures are rich and\r\ndiverse. The challenges they face are specific to each\r\nand every State and community, but their aspirations\r\nare the same: education and health, security and\r\nincome opportunities so that people can make a better\r\nlife for themselves. Nowhere are the challenges greater.\r\nIn initiating the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment, Africa’s leaders have created a powerful\r\nconceptual base for addressing these challenges. In\r\npledging to consolidate democracy and build good\r\ngovernance, to promote peace and security and to\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nuphold human rights, NEPAD could unleash and set in\r\nmotion the great potential inherent in the peoples of\r\nAfrica. My appeal to the heads of State present here is\r\nto show true leadership in translating these intentions\r\ninto concrete action and to continue to address this\r\nissue also vis-à-vis all leaders on the continent.\r\nNEPAD builds on the many earlier initiatives to\r\npromote development in Africa. These initiatives did\r\nnot always work as well as they were intended to, often\r\nbecause of lack of political commitment. The\r\ninternational community must admit its share of\r\nresponsibility. We must also have the courage to admit\r\nthat the absence of accountability and responsibility in\r\ngovernance has played an important part as well.\r\nAgainst this background, we have great\r\nexpectations for the NEPAD African Peer Review\r\nMechanism created to address these problems. It will\r\nassess individual countries’ implementation of the\r\nDeclaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and\r\nCorporate Governance. This is an innovative and\r\ncourageous move. The peer review process is a tool\r\nthat will be decisive in attaining the objectives of\r\nNEPAD and in realizing the vision of the African\r\nUnion. The Norwegian Government will actively\r\nsupport the development of the peer review\r\nmechanism. In particular, we welcome the call to\r\ndevelopment partners to include the monitoring of their\r\nown policies and practices in the review process.\r\nTime and time again, progress in Africa has been\r\ndestroyed by conflict and insecurity. Millions have lost\r\ntheir lives. Precious natural resources have been\r\nmisspent to fuel war. The Peace and Security Initiative\r\nis therefore the strategically most important element in\r\nNEPAD. It is designed to support the implementation\r\nof the African Union Protocol Relating to the\r\nEstablishment of the Peace and Security Council. The\r\nadoption of the Protocol signifies a strong resolve to\r\npromote peace, security and stability in Africa by\r\nAfricans. We welcome the intention to work closely\r\nwith the United Nations Security Council. Bold and\r\nresolute political leadership, sustained over the next\r\ndecade and beyond, is indispensable for making the\r\nProtocol operational and effective.\r\nThe Norwegian Government will continue and\r\nreinforce its support for peace-building efforts in\r\nAfrica and for the development of institutions and\r\ncapabilities for conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution in the context of the Africa Union and\r\nregional organizations.\r\nIn the course of the 1990s, foreign aid fell from\r\n$35 per capita to $19. Non-oil commodity export prices\r\nfell by a third for many African countries. The playing\r\nfield has not been level. We need to reverse the\r\nmarginalization of Africa, but sustainable economic\r\ngrowth — so central to NEPAD — cannot be generated\r\nfrom outside. We have declared ourselves ready to\r\nincrease our efforts. Debt relief and progress towards\r\nfairer trade, improved market access and increased\r\ninvestment continue to be the core issues for economic\r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction in Africa. Norway\r\nis committed to working with African countries and\r\ninternational partners to achieve real progress in these\r\nareas.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ahmed Maher\r\nEl Sayed, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt.\r\nMr. Maher El Sayed (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like at the outset to convey the greetings of\r\nPresident Mohamed Hosni Mubarak of the Arab\r\nRepublic of Egypt. The President has mandated me to\r\nwork on his behalf towards the achievement of\r\npractical and serious results in support of our continent\r\nin its development efforts through the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) initiative. Those\r\nresults should strengthen security, peace, stability and\r\nthe achievement of the socio-economic development\r\ngoals of our continent through the deepening and\r\nconsolidation of democracy.\r\nWhat we put before the Assembly today through\r\nNEPAD, to the formulation of which President\r\nMubarak contributed, is an integrated African vision of\r\nthe problems and questions of the continent. It is a\r\ncomprehensive strategy to address those problems and\r\nquestions. It is backed by a firm political will and a\r\nconscious realization of the responsibilities of the\r\nAfrican peoples and their leadership for the\r\nachievement of the desired objectives.\r\nOur commitment is based on a number of\r\nprinciples, first among which is its “Africanness” and\r\nAfrican ownership. NEPAD is an African vision of the\r\nquestions and problems of Africa. It is a\r\ncomprehensive strategy devised by African intellect\r\nand implemented by African hands. The second\r\npriority is according priority to the regional dimension\r\nin the formulation of the initiative and in its projects\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nand programmes serving the interests of various\r\nregions of Africa as a part of the comprehensive\r\nAfrican common good. Thirdly, NEPAD puts forward a\r\nnew vision for a constructive and serious partnership\r\nwith the United Nations and its various agencies, as\r\nwell as with developed countries and the international\r\norganizations and institutions concerned. The\r\npartnership aims at translating the objectives of\r\nNEPAD into concrete results on the basis of joint\r\ncooperation, mutual interests and mutual respect.\r\nFourthly, in this context, Africa proceeds from the\r\ncollective premise that it cannot accept selectivity or\r\nconditionality. It makes no distinction between the\r\nAfrican countries benefiting from the initiative. The\r\nobjective is common and the interests are mutual.\r\nOur insistence on the African ownership of\r\nNEPAD does not mean that we ignore the need for an\r\nequitable and healthy partnership between us and those\r\ncapable of assisting us. We are aware that the concept\r\nof interdependence is the basis of relations between\r\neconomic entities in the international arena. Indeed, we\r\nlook forward to the establishment of such partnerships\r\nwith the United Nations, the other international\r\ninstitutions concerned with the questions of socio-\r\neconomic development and the developed and donor\r\ncountries. This should respond to the legitimate\r\ndemands of Africa. It would correct Africa’s economic\r\nmarginalization and would address the imbalance in the\r\nworld economic system and in the international trade\r\nsystem. This will be in the interest of all peoples and\r\ncountries, developed and developing alike.\r\nWhile reaffirming anew that NEPAD is not a list\r\nof financial demands nor a statement of Africa’s need\r\nof outside assistance, Africa reiterates that its objective\r\nis the establishment of a partnership with the developed\r\ncountries, a partnership based on the concepts of\r\njustice, common responsibility and the need for each\r\nside to honour its commitments and obligations.\r\nIn this context, we deem it necessary to accord\r\nspecial priority to the following matters. The United\r\nNations must continue to mobilize the necessary\r\nsupport for NEPAD and the cause of development in\r\nAfrica. The role of the United Nations and its\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies in support of the\r\ndevelopment efforts in Africa must be made more\r\neffective, as there is a need for the United Nations to\r\nharmonize its programmes with NEPAD. Coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations and its relevant organs, on\r\nthe one hand, and the African Governments and\r\nAfrican economic groups, on the other, is important for\r\nensuring the implementation of the objectives,\r\nprogrammes and projects of NEPAD. The question of\r\nthe external debt of the African countries must be\r\naddressed, whether by the cancellation or by the\r\nalleviation of the debt burden. This should enable those\r\nresources to be channelled to the development\r\nprogramme in the continent.\r\nWe also accord special attention to honouring the\r\ncommitment of the developed countries to reach the\r\nofficial development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of\r\ntheir gross national product, as this assistance has\r\nconsistently declined during recent years in comparison\r\nto their levels in the early 1990s. African efforts to\r\nattract additional foreign investments to the continent\r\nshould be supported. The developed countries should\r\nrenounce protectionist policies, as they run counter to\r\nthe concept of international trade liberalization, on the\r\none hand, and to those countries’ commitments in the\r\nWorld Trade Organization, on the other, and to the\r\ncommitment to the principle of mutual responsibility.\r\nThere is a need to establish mechanisms to ensure that\r\nthe developed and donor countries honour their\r\ncommitments vis-à-vis African countries.\r\nAfrica has adopted a serious and comprehensive\r\ninitiative: the African Union and, through it, NEPAD.\r\nThis initiative responds to the needs of its peoples. It\r\nreiterates the commitment and determination of the\r\ncontinent’s leaders to shoulder their responsibilities,\r\nthus achieving the hopes of development, security,\r\npeace and prosperity for the peoples of the continent\r\nand its coming generations. The whole world is called\r\nupon to help Africa in this endeavour because the\r\nfuture of each component part of the world depends\r\nultimately on the future of all other component parts.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Per Stig\r\nMoeller, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the European Union.\r\nMr. Moeller (Denmark): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The countries\r\nof Central and Eastern Europe associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Area country of the European Economic\r\nArea, Iceland, all align themselves with this statement.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nThe European Union is greatly encouraged by the\r\nnew hope and prospects for Africa presented by New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and by\r\nthe creation of the African Union in Durban on 9 July\r\n2002. Those two landmark events offer an historic\r\nopportunity for Africa to take control of her destiny\r\nand to lay a new foundation for development in Africa.\r\nIn this respect, the European Union regards the African\r\nUnion and NEPAD as mutually reinforcing.\r\nThe development challenges facing Africa are\r\nenormous. A little more than two years ago, world\r\nleaders committed themselves to working together to\r\nmeet a series of Millennium Development Goals. The\r\noverarching goal is halving the proportion of people\r\nliving in extreme poverty by 2015. A vast number of\r\nthose people live in Africa. The special development\r\nchallenges facing Africa were recognized at the\r\nMillennium Summit. The primary responsibility for\r\nfacing those challenges lies with Africa. But Africa\r\ncannot address them alone. A renewed development\r\npartnership between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity is needed to support Africa in its efforts.\r\nThe European Union considers that NEPAD is the\r\nbasis for such a renewed partnership. The European\r\nUnion is a strong supporter of NEPAD and the promise\r\nit holds for African development as a programme of the\r\nAfrican Union. NEPAD should therefore become the\r\noverall policy framework for the international\r\ncommunity’s relations with Africa in general and for\r\nthe United Nations in particular.\r\nA central feature of NEPAD is the link between\r\neconomic growth, development and the principles of\r\npolitical and economic good governance, and the rule\r\nof law, democratization and respect for human rights.\r\nIn the opinion of the European Union, the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism will be central in making these\r\nNEPAD principles become a reality. Good governance\r\ncannot be imported from outside. It is the will and\r\nability of individual African nations that will carry the\r\nday.\r\nNEPAD is also defined by the African ownership\r\nand the progressive leadership that it embodies. It is an\r\ninitiative taken by Africans for Africans. It is for\r\nAfrican nations to demonstrate their commitment to\r\ngive real content to NEPAD. Delivery of commitments\r\non the African side must be matched with delivery of\r\ncommitments on the part of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nAt the Conference on Financing for Development\r\nin Monterrey in March, developing countries and\r\ndeveloped countries agreed to enter into a new,\r\nmutually binding partnership. An additional $12 billion\r\nper year was pledged for global development\r\nassistance.\r\nIt is first and foremost at the national and\r\nsubregional levels that NEPAD will be translated into\r\naction. The European Union looks to further\r\nclarification and increased coordination among all\r\ndevelopment partners on the implementation of\r\nNEPAD, through the national Poverty Reduction\r\nStrategy Papers and the subregional organizations, as\r\nwell as at the continental level. The European Union\r\nenvisages supporting NEPAD primarily through\r\nexisting cooperation frameworks. The European\r\nCommission is ready to work with NEPAD on defining\r\npriorities, not least in human resources development\r\nand infrastructure.\r\nAt the G-8 summit in Kananaskis, the G-8 Africa\r\nAction Plan was adopted as a framework for action in\r\nsupport of NEPAD. The G-8 members agreed that half\r\nor more of their new development assistance\r\ncommitments announced at Monterrey could be\r\ndirected to African nations that govern justly, invest in\r\ntheir own people and promote economic freedom. They\r\nalso committed themselves to providing sufficient\r\nresources to eradicate polio by 2005, in addition to\r\ntheir ongoing commitments to combat malaria,\r\ntuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and to working with\r\nAfrican partners to deliver a joint plan by 2003 for the\r\ndevelopment of African capability to undertake peace\r\nsupport operations. The European Union will also work\r\non securing fairer trade conditions for Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that business as usual\r\nwill not promote development in Africa. The African\r\nleaders and people have raised the stakes with the\r\nadoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). The international community\r\nshould be prepared to match this. The European Union\r\nhas.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Louis Michel,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Belgium.\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): I would\r\nlike to salute the vision of the future, the sense of\r\nhistory and political courage of the founders of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nwould like to convey my esteem to the Presidents of\r\nSouth Africa, Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria and Senegal.\r\nThis initiative opens the way to a new relation with the\r\ninternational community and an ambition based on a\r\nnoble concept of the future for their populations. By\r\ngiving the project a regional perspective, they will\r\nresist the temptation of withdrawing into themselves,\r\nwhile at the same time giving the international\r\ncommunity a special responsibility it cannot, this time,\r\navoid. In fact, this initiative presents a courageous\r\nchallenge to break with an antiquated paternalistic, if\r\nnot humiliating, cooperation of the past.\r\nWhen the Belgian presidency learned of this\r\nproject, we became quickly convinced that it broke\r\ndecisively with the classic concept of partnership that\r\nhad existed amongst our peoples.\r\nNEPAD was conceived by Africans for Africans.\r\nIt affirms that there is no development without good\r\ngovernance. There is no democratization without\r\nrespect for human rights. It seeks to place the primary\r\nresponsibility for development on African\r\nGovernments themselves. NEPAD shares the ambitions\r\nand views of another great project, the African Union.\r\nIn making the commitment to submit their policies to\r\nrigorous examination by their peers African\r\nGovernments make a courageous and convincing\r\npolitical choice.\r\nMillions of Africans are threatened with famine\r\ntoday. The tragedy of HIV/AIDS has brought down the\r\nlife expectancy dramatically. Throughout Africa, there\r\nis misery, violence and, too often, we see despair.\r\nNEPAD brings new hope and we cannot let it fail for\r\nlack of foreign support. We must all mobilize to\r\nsupport it.\r\nThe volume of assistance to Africa is far from\r\nsufficient. Even worse, Africa receives only one\r\nquarter of the aid for the countries of the Organization\r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\r\nand the United Nations system. This is much less than\r\nwhat Africa should receive in development aid if we\r\nare to take seriously the Millennium Summit\r\ndevelopment goal of reducing poverty by one half\r\nbetween now and 2015.\r\nI think back to the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Johannesburg (WSSD) with a little\r\nhope and a lot of disappointments. We did not show\r\ntrue solidarity, yet there was widespread agreement in\r\nour analyses. But there was not enough political\r\nwillpower.\r\nWe are going to adopt a new political declaration,\r\nbut only actions count. For the donors, they must make\r\na substantial effort in three basic areas: financing, debt\r\nand access to markets. It is time for the international\r\ncommunity to pay its dues to this magnificent continent\r\nthat was the cradle of humanity.\r\nAs far as Belgium is concerned, we increased our\r\naid this year for the fourth consecutive time. And\r\nbetween now and 2010, we will reach the objective of\r\n0.7 per cent of GDP to provide assistance. More than\r\nsixty percent of our aid goes to Africa. Access to our\r\nfinancial institutions and to our markets and\r\ntechnology, these are the forms our assistance to Africa\r\ntake and we are convinced that NEPAD will become\r\nthe framework for relations between the United\r\nNations and Africa.\r\nTo sum up, during the World Conference against\r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and\r\nRelated Intolerance in Durban, together we noted our\r\nwill to put an end to the darkest chapters of our history,\r\nso that we could build a new relation based on mutual\r\nrespect, solidarity and partnership. NEPAD lays the\r\ngroundwork for this partnership. The New Partnership\r\nfor Development in Africa is a hope, first and\r\nforemost, translated into a strategy and a project. But it\r\nis more than that. It is no less than the most noble\r\nambition, the ambition of liberating Africa from lack of\r\naction, from pain and the complexes of an unfair\r\ndestiny that brought only humiliation, exploitation and\r\nunhappiness.\r\nMake no mistake. This initiative is an act of\r\noptimistic liberation which will finally put an end to\r\nthe injustices of Africa’s history. Belgium, more than\r\nothers, owes steadfast support to Africa because a large\r\npart of our history is Africa’s history. And the common\r\npages of that history were not all written in the ink of\r\ngenerosity and respect.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by Her Excellency, Mrs. Lydie Polfer,\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and External Trade of Luxembourg.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nMrs. Lydie Polfer (Luxembourg) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Since the launching of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) a fresh wind seems\r\nto be blowing across the African continent. Few\r\ninitiatives of this kind have previously received such\r\nresponse all over the world and have given rise to so\r\nmuch hope.\r\nAs the President of the European Union said,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the fifteen nations, Luxembourg\r\nwelcomes and is gratified by this new impetus, this\r\nnew dynamic creation. NEPAD is an invitation to a\r\nfresh constructive partnership between Africa and the\r\ninternational community to reduce the development\r\ngap. Luxembourg accepts this invitation and expects\r\nfruitful cooperation to result from it.\r\nIn 1992 at the Rio de Janeiro Conference, the\r\nLuxembourg government made a solemn commitment\r\nto achieve, by the end of the decade, the target of 0.7\r\nper cent of its GDP devoted to official development\r\nassistance. That goal was achieved in 2000 and our\r\nnew target is to increase our aid to one per cent of GDP\r\nby 2005.\r\nThis political commitment is reflected also by a\r\nchoice of method. Over the years and with an increase\r\nin its resources, Luxembourg’s cooperation has\r\nundergone a process of carefully considered change. At\r\nthe end of that process, the project approach was\r\nconsidered too piecemeal and rigid and was replaced\r\nby a programmatic and multi-year approach. Within\r\nthis new framework, a paramount place is given to\r\nrespect for democratic principles, human rights and the\r\nrule of the law and good governance. Since that time,\r\npartnership has become the keystone of Luxembourg’s\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn practice, each programme or project must form\r\npart of the country’s development plan and must be\r\nlisted on its set of priorities. Within this framework,\r\nspecial emphasis is placed upon the exchange of\r\nknowledge and know-how for the development of\r\nvocational aptitudes and management in the partner\r\ncountries. Luxembourg has established special\r\npartnerships with six African countries and NEPAD’s\r\npriority sectors form part of Luxembourg’s main\r\nsectors for cooperation. Thus, more than 80 per cent of\r\nour bilateral cooperation is devoted to infrastructures\r\nand social services, while projects in the health and\r\neducation sectors cover more than 50 per cent of our\r\nfunds. If there is a broad convergence of spirit and\r\napproach, Luxembourg attaches, nevertheless, great\r\nimportance to the idea that its partner countries should\r\nshoulder their proper share of the responsibility in\r\nimplementing common endeavours.\r\nGood governance, both political and economic, is\r\nhenceforth recognized rightly as an essential condition\r\nfor the success of development activities. Transparency\r\nin management and participation of the people in\r\ndecision-making processes, especially at the local\r\nlevel, are two important concepts which are regarded as\r\nessential to measure the degree to which beneficiaries\r\nassume ownership of development activities, because it\r\nis the feeling of being involved that in fact makes\r\ndevelopment sustainable.\r\nNEPAD provides for a peer review mechanism;\r\nthis mechanism is in fact one of the specific features of\r\nthe New Partnership. NEPAD is an African initiative\r\nthat is managed by Africans for Africans. It represents\r\na commitment of African leaders to their people, but\r\nalso a mutual commitment. To carry out this oath and\r\nthe promises that stem from it, the countries of Africa\r\ncan count on the support of my country.\r\nAfrica has taken courageous new initiatives, and\r\nit is up to us in the international community to be with\r\nAfrica and to support Africa in that regard.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency, Tang Jiaxuan, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of China.\r\nMr. Jiaxuan (China) (spoke in Chinese): The\r\nhigh-level plenary meeting of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly to consider how to support the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) is once\r\nagain focusing the world’s attention on issues of\r\nAfrica’s development. On behalf of the Chinese\r\nGovernment, I wish to express our appreciation for the\r\nefforts of the United Nations that have made this\r\nconference possible.\r\nThe official launching of the African Union in\r\nJuly of this year marked a new historical stage in\r\nAfrica’s pursuit of common development and\r\nrejuvenation. However, generally speaking, African\r\ncountries have yet to enjoy the benefits of economic\r\nglobalization. The gap between Africa and the rest of\r\nthe world in overall development is still widening. This\r\nis not only a challenge to African countries, but also an\r\nissue that the international community must pay closer\r\nattention to and endeavour to address.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nNEPAD is an important step taken by African\r\ncountries to meet the challenges of the new century\r\nthrough greater unity and self-improvement. We\r\nsupport African countries in their unremitting efforts to\r\nachieve all NEPAD objectives in light of their needs\r\nand the actual conditions for Africa’s renaissance. The\r\nUnited Nations has an irreplaceable role in promoting\r\nAfrican development, and a constructive role in\r\npromoting the international community’s support for\r\nNEPAD.\r\nThe international community, especially the\r\ndeveloped countries, have the responsibility and\r\nobligation to adopt more active and effective measures\r\nto create a sound international environment for the\r\neconomic development of African countries. The\r\ndeveloped countries should reverse the declining trend\r\nof development assistance as soon as possible. They\r\nshould work to ensure that their official development\r\nassistance accounts for 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\nnational product, to reduce or cancel the debts of\r\nAfrican countries, to expand and improve the market\r\naccess of African countries, and to transfer applicable\r\ntechnologies to Africa. They should also help African\r\ncountries to build capacity to combat diseases,\r\nincluding HIV/AIDS.\r\nChina has long maintained a good and\r\ncooperative relationship with African countries, and is\r\nfollowing closely the progress of Africa. China\r\nsuccessfully hosted the Forum on China-Africa\r\nCooperation at the Ministerial Conference Beijing\r\n2000, and established relevant follow-up mechanisms.\r\nWe have begun to cancel 10 billion yuan of African\r\ncountries’ debts to China, as we had promised. Follow-\r\nup actions in the technical and economic cooperation\r\nfields, and many others, are also under way.\r\nThe Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and\r\nNEPAD share the same objective of promoting\r\ncooperation and common development. We believe that\r\nthe active implementation of Forum follow-up\r\nactivities by China and Africa will be a strong boost to\r\nthe process of African development and NEPAD. We\r\nwill, as always, support reasonable demands and just\r\npropositions of the African countries. We sincerely\r\nhope to see a gradual and full implementation of\r\nNEPAD.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by Her Excellency, Mrs. Agnes Van\r\nArdenne, Minister for Development Cooperation of the\r\nKingdom of The Netherlands.\r\nMrs. Van Ardenne (Netherlands) (spoke in\r\nEnglish): The whole world needs to work together to\r\nsecure Africa’s rightful place on the world stage. Both\r\nAfrica and the developed world have to live up to their\r\nmutual commitments.\r\nNEPAD shows that a growing number of African\r\nleaders feel a strong sense of urgency. I applaud their\r\nleadership. NEPAD is a fine initiative, given the urgent\r\nneed for ownership and for leaders in Africa to take\r\nresponsibility for solving Africa’s problems. The\r\nproposed Peer Reviews demonstrate that Africans take\r\nAfrica’s problems very seriously indeed. I see NEPAD\r\nas a sign that Africans share a resolve to prevent\r\nconflict and improve their policies and governance.\r\nIndeed, genuinely owned and improved policies and\r\ngovernance are the requirements for development. And\r\nit must be understood that for NEPAD to succeed it\r\nmust be Africa-driven.\r\nHowever, Africa cannot walk this difficult new\r\npath alone. We rich countries must fulfil our part of the\r\nbargain and create room for Africa on the world stage.\r\nAnd it is not just Governments that need to be\r\ninvolved. Development assistance is a common\r\ninvestment in a common future. For that investment to\r\nsucceed, we need partners from many sides:\r\nmultilateral organizations, Governments, the private\r\nsector and civil society.\r\nWe need better results from all the efforts aimed\r\nat fighting poverty: African domestic resources, debt\r\nrelief, export income, foreign direct investments and\r\ndonor aid. I repeat my appeal to all donors to honour\r\nthe 0.7 per cent commitment on development\r\nassistance. We will have to increase aid in order to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nRecent political change in the Netherlands did not\r\naffect our firm commitment to earmark 0.8 per cent of\r\nour gross domestic product for development\r\ncooperation. Moreover, the Netherlands will spend at\r\nleast half of its bilateral aid budget in Africa.\r\nBut money alone is not enough. We must pursue\r\nAfrica-friendly economic policies. Besides\r\nstrengthening local and regional markets in Africa, we\r\nhave to open our markets. We have to abolish subsidies\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nthat distort trade and harm the environment. The\r\ncoherence of our policy in areas such as trade and\r\ndevelopment remains an absolute priority. If wealthy\r\ncountries do not drastically reduce their subsidies on\r\nproducts such as sugar, cotton, meat and milk, then we\r\ncannot credibly call ourselves true partners to the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and to NEPAD. That is\r\nwhy our policy focus will be more integrated than ever\r\nbefore, and Africa is the focal point of this integrated\r\npolicy.\r\nLet us also bring in the private sector to reverse\r\nthe downturn in foreign investment. In 1990 2 per cent\r\nof all investments went to Africa. Ten years later this\r\nfigure had fallen to 0.35 per cent. In Johannesburg we\r\nformed partnerships, for example, on food security in\r\nEthiopia and in Eritrea. This is not the private sector\r\nhijacking sustainable development, but having an\r\nessential partner for development join the effort.\r\nOne thing we should not forget is that women in\r\nAfrica are key partners in development. Numerous\r\nstudies have pointed out that the inclusion of women is\r\nindispensable for sustainable development. How many\r\nmore studies do we need to acknowledge this basic\r\nfact? I call upon African leaders to give women the\r\nnecessary space to participate in development. How\r\ncan we make our investment in development\r\nproductive if we leave more than 50 per cent of our\r\nhuman potential under-utilized?\r\nWe industrialized nations must generously fulfil\r\nour commitment, and we must stand ready to assist\r\nwhen Africa needs our help. Last week in\r\nJohannesburg I signed an agreement with the South\r\nAfrican Institute of International Affairs to disseminate\r\nNEPAD more widely in Africa and to support its\r\nefforts to involve civil society in the NEPAD\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nWe are ready to deploy efforts both great and\r\nsmall to help make NEPAD happen. It provides us with\r\nthe right setting of good governance. In this setting, the\r\ncombined efforts of both the developing and the\r\nindustrialized world can and will make a decisive\r\ndifference in the lives of Africans. Let us make NEPAD\r\nhappen.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Ana Palacio, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Spain.\r\nMrs. Palacio (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): We\r\ncannot ignore data that we have no choice but to call\r\ntragic: 6 million refugees, 20 million internally\r\ndisplaced persons, more than 120 million illiterates, an\r\nextremely high rate of infant mortality, and the impact\r\nof AIDS. We have a shared responsibility to act to\r\nradically change this reality Africa faces.\r\nAfrica, however, given its complexity, also is a\r\nsource of hope. Positive developments have taken place\r\nrecently across the continent and for all of us. I should\r\nlike to highlight, together with the ongoing peace\r\nprocesses, the transition from the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity to the African Union, and its particular\r\nemphasis on the integration component. For my part, as\r\na citizen of Spain and of Europe, I believe that\r\nintegration mechanisms represent an important means\r\nof economic and social progress.\r\nThe Monterrey and Johannesburg Summits paid\r\nspecial attention to the fight against poverty across the\r\nAfrican continent. In this context, it is noteworthy that,\r\nduring the Spanish presidency of the European Union\r\nand within the framework of the Monterrey Consensus,\r\nagreement was reached among the countries of the\r\nEuropean Union to mobilize an additional $20 billion\r\nbetween now and 2006.\r\nIn this context, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is a crucial initiative. Allow\r\nme to stress the fact that it addresses Africa’s political,\r\neconomic and social priorities in an extremely\r\nconsistent and balanced way. Those priorities include:\r\npeace and security; political, economic and business\r\ngovernance; the importance of human resources; the\r\nestablishment of basic infrastructures; access to global\r\nmarkets; and protection of the environment.\r\nThese priorities can be summed up along two\r\nmajor axes: conflict resolution and poverty eradication.\r\nThe consequences of conflict and poverty are adversely\r\naffecting the African people in the form of arms\r\ntrafficking; the tragedy of child soldiers; amputees\r\nwhose limbs were lost to landmines; the lack, or even\r\nthe destruction, of basic infrastructures; and the spread\r\nof infectious diseases, including the very serious\r\nproblem of AIDS, which I mentioned earlier.\r\nSpain welcomes with great satisfaction the\r\ndecisive African leadership demonstrated by NEPAD,\r\nwhich shows that African States have taken on the\r\nresponsibility of managing their own development. We\r\ndeem it particularly positive that it is the African\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nGovernments that will determine the evaluation criteria\r\nin implementing this initiative.\r\nThe Peer Review Mechanism, designed to verify\r\nthe degree of compliance with the criteria of good\r\ngovernance, is a clear reflection of this African\r\nleadership and shows the need to establish clear and\r\ntransparent guidelines within the framework of NEPAD\r\nto increase the flow of private investment to Africa.\r\nThis objective, in parallel with the public financing\r\nboost provided by the G-8 Africa Action Plan, also\r\nthrough NEPAD, represents a window of opportunity\r\nfor the integration of the African economies in an\r\nincreasingly globalized world.\r\nEradicating poverty is our common goal. Let me\r\nstress in this context the indispensable role of African\r\nwomen. They have placed themselves at the front line\r\nof development, despite the many difficulties they must\r\nendure. It is therefore essential to insist on the\r\neducation of girls, food safety and access to drinking\r\nwater and to health services, and to ensure that these\r\npriorities are taken into account in all development\r\nprojects in Africa, in keeping with the objectives set by\r\nNEPAD itself.\r\nSpain and the European Union have been\r\nfollowing with interest these developments in the\r\ncontext of the Cairo process and of the European\r\nUnion’s political dialogue with Africa since the G-8\r\nGroup of Donors Meeting for the G-8 Summit and the\r\nKananaskis Summit itself.\r\nIt has been said that historical sea changes do not\r\nstart when things go wrong, but rather when it is\r\ndiscerned that they can be changed. The sum total of\r\nthe initiatives pooled in the crucible of NEPAD amount\r\nto a genuine revolution in terms of Africa’s role in the\r\ninternational community. My country — a bridge\r\nbetween Europe and Africa for geographical and\r\ncultural reasons as well as reasons of commitment — is\r\nready to play its role in this historical process of\r\nmutual enhancement.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Brian Cowen, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Ireland.\r\nMr. Cowen (Ireland): The Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Denmark, Mr. Per Stig Moeller, has already\r\naddressed this high-level meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on behalf of the European Union. Ireland\r\nassociates itself fully with his remarks.\r\nBuilding hope, taking stock, looking to the future\r\nand meeting challenges are the bedrock themes of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nNEPAD is a courageous and honest blueprint for\r\naction — not just for Africa, but for all of us. NEPAD\r\nis about new hope, because the formation of the\r\nAfrican Union and the development of NEPAD offer\r\nimaginative perspectives and opportunities for all the\r\npeoples of Africa.\r\nNEPAD is also about challenges, because what is\r\nat stake is not just a new partnership within Africa for\r\nAfrica’s development. NEPAD offers clear and detailed\r\ngoals to African Governments and the peoples of\r\nAfrica. Now the task of implementation begins, and\r\nthat will require a lot of courage, hard work and\r\ndetermination.\r\nNEPAD also offers similar challenges to the\r\nwider world beyond Africa, to join together in a new\r\ncreative partnership for Africa, to build new bridges\r\nbetween Africa and the world, and at last to match our\r\nwords with our deeds in helping to advance sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa and end its marginalization from\r\nthe world economy.\r\nNEPAD is an initiative by Africa and for Africa.\r\nBuilding on earlier initiatives, it offers goals and\r\ntargets matched by an operational framework for\r\nmeeting those targets. It states clearly to the\r\ninternational community: this is our way forward —\r\nbut it must also involve a dual partnership. It is a\r\npartnership within Africa, but also a challenge to\r\ndeveloped countries to agree on a new partnership for\r\nAfrica.\r\nThis time, the new partnership in Africa and for\r\nAfrica must succeed where other initiatives have failed.\r\nSupporting economic growth goals and advancing\r\nsustainable development in Africa must mean strong\r\nand imaginative action by the international community\r\nin tackling the structural causes of poverty in Africa; in\r\noffering fair market access to African countries for\r\ntheir products; in mobilizing financial, technical and\r\ninvestment resources to enable Africa to compete fairly\r\nwith the rest of the world; in tackling unacceptable\r\ndebt levels — in short, in giving a fair chance, on fair\r\nterms, to Africa. That is what Africa is asking for. And\r\nthat, in fundamentals, is the basis of NEPAD.\r\nLet me highlight four main themes that Ireland\r\nconsiders of special importance in implementing\r\nNEPAD.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nFirst, a main strength of NEPAD is its recognition\r\nof strong links between advancing sustainable\r\ndevelopment and political and economic governance.\r\nToo many conflicts in recent decades have torn apart\r\nmuch of the fabric of Africa. Poor political and\r\neconomic governance in some African countries has\r\nunfairly cast a blight on Africa as a whole, and too\r\noften the wider world has shrugged and said, “There is\r\nnothing we can do”, in response to the daunting\r\neconomic and social challenges facing Africa.\r\nNow, Africa is putting forward its own clear\r\npolitical and economic governance standards, as well\r\nas new mechanisms, such as the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism, to provide necessary institutional\r\nscaffolding. This is wise and courageous.\r\nSecondly, NEPAD, as a programme of the African\r\nUnion, will allow for creative interaction at a structural\r\nlevel so that political and economic actions and\r\nsustainable development policies advance in harmony.\r\nOver recent decades, we in Europe have travelled our\r\nown journey of putting in place structures of\r\ncooperation to serve all of our peoples. Africa is now\r\nembarked on the same path.\r\nThirdly, NEPAD cannot succeed unless the\r\ninternational community, explicitly and with strong\r\nactions, plays its part in support of NEPAD. The G-8\r\nhave made a good start in the Africa Action Plan\r\nagreed at Kananaskis. President Mbeki and other\r\nAfrican leaders have rightly said that economic\r\nopportunities for Africa are also economic\r\nopportunities for developed countries.\r\nOur words must now be matched by our deeds. In\r\nshort, we in the international community must strongly\r\nsupport NEPAD proposals on resource mobilization; on\r\ntrading opportunities, including, of course, in the Doha\r\nRound; on tackling debt; in the fight against HIV/AIDS\r\nand other infectious diseases; and in allowing Africa\r\nthe chance — for which it is asking — to become fully\r\nintegrated into the global economy.\r\nDeveloped countries must rapidly, and in full,\r\nmeet the commitments given at the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, held at\r\nMonterrey last March.\r\nWith regard to Ireland’s own commitment, my\r\nPrime Minister, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, restated at the\r\nJohannesburg Summit Ireland’s commitment to meet,\r\nby 2007, the United Nations target of spending 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross national product on international\r\ndevelopment cooperation.\r\nFourthly, the United Nations must provide strong\r\nand active leadership in support of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development. This will involve all of the\r\ninstitutions of the United Nations, including the\r\nSecurity Council. The United Nations family must\r\nwork in concert so that Africa moves to the forefront of\r\nour collective agenda.\r\nToday we have an opportunity to express\r\ncommitment and support for NEPAD. On behalf of\r\nIreland, I do this warmly. And I do so with the absolute\r\nassurance of our support in the period ahead.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Antonio Martins Da\r\nCruz, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal.\r\nMr. Da Cruz (Portugal): Today more than ever,\r\npeople ask their leaders to make their dreams come\r\ntrue, confident of and optimistic for a better future.\r\nAfrica, more than any other continent, has been\r\nlacking such confidence and optimism for too long.\r\nPoverty, starvation, disease, war, debt, and corruption:\r\nall of those ills have been growing and are widespread.\r\nBecause of them, Africa has become the forgotten\r\ncontinent. But as we say in Portugal, “Where there is\r\nlife, there should be hope”. I believe that it was with a\r\nsimilar mindset that the leaders of the continent\r\nconceived a far-reaching initiative, by Africans and for\r\nAfricans, powered by a global vision and by global\r\nvalues.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) can be considered to be a stepping stone; it is\r\nthe first single policy aimed at changing an entire\r\ncontinent. Its endorsement by the States of the African\r\nUnion emphasizes its African leadership and African\r\nownership of the development process. At the same\r\ntime, it calls for a new partnership based on shared\r\nresponsibility and mutual interest.\r\nAs with any partnership, this one is a two-way\r\nstreet; the obligations are reciprocal. As far as we non-\r\nAfricans are concerned, it will mean efforts to make\r\nour development assistance more effective, as well as\r\nto ensure that our markets are open to business with\r\nAfrica. That is the only way to allow capital flows to\r\nhave a real impact in reducing poverty and increasing\r\nopportunity for African investments.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nFor the African partners, it will basically mean\r\nadding substance to the initiative through good\r\ngovernance and strengthening the democratic process,\r\nthrough sound economic policies; through the\r\ndevelopment of policies in the fields of health,\r\neducation, agriculture, and the management of water\r\nresources; and through the improvement of regional\r\ntrade.\r\nThe bottom line for the success of this initiative\r\nis that it must be embraced by all Africans. All levels\r\nof African society need to be active participants. The\r\nkey is having Africans work together for the good of\r\nAfrica.\r\nBoth the Western world and several countries in\r\nAfrica have to share the blame for the fact that large\r\nparts of the continent are far poorer than they need to\r\nbe. Despite our promises, we Europeans have not\r\ndedicated enough of our resources to fighting the\r\nproblems of Africa or developed adequate cooperation\r\npolicies. At the same time, some African leaders have\r\nresisted implementing measures to promote equitable\r\nincome distribution, human rights, democracy and the\r\nrule of law. It is time to change that.\r\nAs is well known, in recent decades much of\r\nPortugal’s foreign policy has been focused — as,\r\nindeed, it still is — on issues of special concern and\r\ninterest to Africa.\r\nThe challenges facing the African continent are\r\nserious and complex. Unfortunately, we are daily\r\nreminded of them. Some African countries are still\r\ninvolved in international conflicts and civil wars or still\r\nsuffer violent social unrest. Some African countries\r\nstill have to make a full transition to democracy. One\r\nAfrican out of two continues to live in absolute\r\npoverty, a situation that is only aggravated by the\r\nspreading of diseases.\r\nBut all coins have two sides, and the reality is\r\nalso that Africa is breeding a new generation of leaders\r\nactively promoting a vast and unstoppable movement\r\ntowards democracy, peace and economic and social\r\nprogress. The past few decades have seen the majority\r\nof African nations making enormous progress in\r\nestablishing political, economic and social structures,\r\nin ending age-old conflicts and in launching regional\r\ncooperation and integration.\r\nWhat I would like to reiterate here is that\r\nPortugal is more than ever committed to its relationship\r\nwith Africa. We cannot miss the opportunity to make\r\nsure that Africa moves from declarations to concrete\r\ndeeds, from statements to specific results. Within the\r\nEuropean Union (EU), we have from the very\r\nbeginning reiterated our support for NEPAD. Portugal\r\nwill remain an active defender of the initiative. The\r\nnext Europe-Africa Summit, to be hosted by Portugal\r\nin April 2003, will also constitute a good opportunity\r\nto give new impetus to our common priorities. We\r\nbelieve that the agendas of the EU-Africa dialogue and\r\nof NEPAD have the potential to converge on all\r\npossible issues and to find a common approach to\r\ncommon solutions. NEPAD will not achieve success\r\novernight. The situation in Africa is the result of\r\ngenerations of decline. This path will call for the\r\ncommitment of all parties involved.\r\nFinally, the role of the United Nations will\r\ncontinue to be central in ensuring that Africa remains\r\non the global agenda.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore, His\r\nExcellency Mr. S. Jayakumar.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): I am honoured to\r\nbe with you, Mr. President, at this high-level plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly to consider how to\r\nsupport the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nAfrica faces a challenging future beset by a\r\ncompetitive and difficult external environment. The\r\nadoption of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) by\r\nthe General Assembly in 1991 raised expectations with\r\nregard to better prospects for Africa. But the final\r\nreport of UN-NADAF starkly concludes that, at the end\r\nof what was dubbed Africa’s development decade,\r\nsome 80 million more Africans live in poverty.\r\nHowever, at the same time, a quiet renaissance of\r\npositive leadership has emerged on the continent.\r\nNEPAD is a bold and timely initiative. With its\r\nambitious agenda of renewal, NEPAD offers the\r\npromise of transforming Africa’s developmental\r\nprospects.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that NEPAD stresses the\r\nimportance of good governance and advocates the\r\nestablishment of effective corporate and political\r\ngovernance in Africa. Equally important, the NEPAD\r\nHeads of State Forum will serve as a focal point to\r\nassess periodically the progress made by African\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\ncountries in meeting their governance commitments.\r\nThe African Peer Review Mechanism is a particularly\r\nbold and novel experiment. Its success will set NEPAD\r\napart from other initiatives that have sought to\r\novercome Africa’s fundamental problems.\r\nNEPAD’s core concept of an enhanced\r\npartnership, premised on mutual respect and\r\naccountability, has the potential to transform the\r\nstagnating aid relationship between Africa and the\r\ninternational donor community. The international\r\ncommunity must not let that opportunity pass by.\r\nNEPAD’s success depends ultimately on what African\r\ncountries do individually and collectively, but it is also\r\na test of the international community’s willingness to\r\ndeepen and sustain its engagement with Africa on a\r\nlevel playing field.\r\nIt was in that spirit that, a decade ago, my country\r\nestablished its Singapore Cooperation Programme, a\r\ntechnical assistance programme to help other\r\ndeveloping countries adapt our experiences to their\r\nneeds. Since the inception of the programme in 1992,\r\nwe have trained more than 2,000 participants from 45\r\nAfrican countries. They come to Singapore for a wide\r\nvariety of courses, whose subjects range from civil\r\naviation to information technology, trade, tourism and\r\nthe environment. As a small country, we stand ready to\r\nhelp in a practical and concrete way, both bilaterally\r\nand together with other countries and institutions.\r\nThe United Nations, in particular, has a role to\r\nplay in supporting NEPAD. While NEPAD’s\r\nrelationship with the United Nations is pivotal, it\r\nremains largely undefined. Now that there is a\r\nuniversal recognition of the special needs of Africa, the\r\nkey question is how the United Nations can help Africa\r\nand its development partners achieve lasting, tangible\r\ngains within the framework of NEPAD.\r\nLet me elaborate on one way the United Nations\r\ncan do that. During Singapore’s presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council in May this year, I chaired an\r\ninteractive debate on the role, function and programme\r\nof work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict\r\nPrevention and Resolution in Africa. One of the\r\nconclusions drawn from that debate was that, as Africa\r\nundertakes its own initiatives under NEPAD, the\r\nWorking Group can provide a channel for the\r\ninternational community to reciprocate and initiate\r\nreinforcing programmes. Under the able chairmanship\r\nof Ambassador Jagdish Koonjul of Mauritius, the\r\nGroup has been considering the ways in which the\r\nSecurity Council can best support NEPAD.\r\nToday’s meeting signals that the NEPAD\r\ninitiative is already beginning to create a sense of\r\nrenewal and partnership, both among Africans and\r\nbetween Africa and the rest of the world. NEPAD\r\nopens up the prospect for major resource flows of both\r\naid and trade to Africa. It is poised to reset the\r\ndevelopment partnership on the basis of good\r\ngovernance in Africa. The United Nations and the\r\ninternational community should therefore build on that\r\nmomentum quickly to help Africa realize its full\r\npotential.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States, His Excellency\r\nMr. Colin Powell.\r\nMr. Powell (United States): I am very pleased to\r\nbe here today to express the American Government’s\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\r\nPresident Bush and the American people care\r\ndeeply about Africa. We share the same hopes and\r\ndreams as our African brothers and sisters. We all want\r\nto live in freedom and dignity, free from disease. We\r\nall want jobs that let us put bread on our tables, provide\r\na roof over our heads and offer a decent education to\r\nour children. And, as the Secretary-General noted\r\nearlier this morning, we must also not lose our focus on\r\ncombating Africa’s greatest threat: HIV/AIDS and\r\nother infectious diseases. We are here today because\r\nwe are committed to supporting efforts by African\r\nGovernments, by other organizations and by\r\nindividuals to improve the lives of their people through\r\nlasting economic growth and development.\r\nWe meet at a time of optimism. The international\r\ncommunity has come together around a common vision\r\nof shared responsibility for development. At the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment held at Monterrey, and again at the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held at\r\nJohannesburg, world leaders recognized the need for a\r\ntrue partnership to tap into development financing from\r\nall sources: trade, private investment and domestic\r\nresources, as well as Government aid from other\r\nnations. They also agreed that development must begin\r\nat home with the sound economic and political\r\ngovernance at all levels necessary to attract\r\ndevelopment capital and to use it well. The\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nJohannesburg plan is an important part of the effort to\r\ndevelop and implement a blueprint for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, and the United States was proud to join\r\nthe consensus in Johannesburg not too long ago.\r\nBut plans are not enough. Only effective actions\r\ncan put people to work, provide clean water to thirsty\r\nchildren, or prevent the transmission of a deadly virus\r\nfrom mother to child. That is our challenge.\r\nThe United States is stepping up to that\r\nchallenge. Energetic American efforts were\r\ninstrumental in the successful launch of the Doha\r\nDevelopment Round of world trade talks, the first ones\r\never focused on development.\r\nNow that Congress has granted President Bush\r\ntrade promotion authority, the United States is poised\r\nto lead toward greater trade-based prosperity.\r\nAt the Monterrey Conference, President Bush\r\nunveiled his Millennium Challenge Account initiative\r\nto seek funding to increase our direct assistance to\r\nnations in need over the next three years to a new level,\r\n50 per cent higher than our current level of aid support.\r\nThe $5 billion in new money will go every year to\r\ndeveloping nations that are governed wisely and fairly,\r\nthat are strongly committed to investing in health and\r\neducation and which follow economic policies that\r\nencourage entrepreneurs and spur growth. We were\r\nactive at the World Food Summit in Rome. We pledged\r\nan additional $90 million for programmes to help small\r\nfarmers harness science and technology and the power\r\nof free markets, to improve crop yields and to bolster\r\nincomes.\r\nAt Johannesburg, we introduced effective\r\npartnerships to expand access to clean water and\r\naffordable energy, reduce pollution, provide jobs and\r\nimprove food supplies, for millions of people. And,\r\nwith the African Growth and Opportunity Act\r\n(AGOA), we are rewarding good development policy\r\nwith expanded access to United States markets.\r\nAfrica is also stepping up to the development\r\nchallenge, especially with the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development that we are discussing this\r\nmorning, NEPAD. With NEPAD, Africa’s leaders have\r\naccepted primary responsibility for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. They have committed themselves to the\r\nchanges their countries need to attract and use\r\ndevelopment capital from all sources. They have\r\npledged to open their Governments, strengthen their\r\neconomies, and educate their people.\r\nWe welcome this new direction in Africa’s\r\ndevelopment efforts. But countries that fail to live up\r\nto NEPAD’s commitments will suffer. Zimbabwe’s\r\neconomic decline is a warning about the dangers of\r\nignoring the linkage between good policies and human\r\ndevelopment.\r\nLast summer, Presidents Mbeki, Obasanjo,\r\nBouteflika and Wade continued the dialogue on African\r\ndevelopment at the Group of Eight (G-8) Summit in\r\nCanada. President Bush and the other G-8 leaders\r\ncommitted their Governments to stronger partnerships\r\nwith countries whose performance reflects the\r\ncommitments that are being made by the nations\r\nparticipating in NEPAD. The real test is yet to come,\r\nhowever. The people of Africa, and indeed the people\r\nof the world, will ultimately judge this initiative on\r\nwhether its bold rhetoric and commitments are\r\nreflected in concrete action for change and greater\r\nwell-being.\r\nThe evidence shows that countries that adhere to\r\nthe types of reforms for which NEPAD stands face a\r\nbetter future. We see this in the impact of AGOA.\r\nNations such as South Africa, Lesotho and\r\nMadagascar, which are taking advantage of the AGOA\r\nbargain, are seeing trade, foreign investment and\r\neconomic growth all increase as a result of their\r\ncommitment.\r\nI can assure you all, my friends and colleagues,\r\nthat the United States is committed to helping the\r\npeople of Africa build a peaceful, prosperous and\r\ndemocratic future. NEPAD’s principles of good\r\ngovernance, open markets and human rights show the\r\nway.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Dominique Galouzeau\r\nde Villepin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of France.\r\nMr. Galouzeau de Villepin (France) (spoke in\r\nFrench): At the present time, and we are all delighted\r\nat this, the main crises on the African continent are\r\nmoving towards stabilization. Prospects for peace are\r\nappearing on the horizon in Angola, Ethiopia, Eritrea,\r\nSudan and even in the Great Lakes. This results, in the\r\nmain, from the efforts of Africans themselves, but also\r\nfrom the very considerable commitment made by the\r\ninternational community. Today, the bulk of resources\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\ndevoted to peacekeeping by the United Nations are\r\nbeing deployed in Africa.\r\nAt a time when we are thus making progress in\r\nthe resolution of conflicts, it is essential to do\r\neverything we can also to foster the economic\r\ndevelopment of the African continent, because there\r\ncan be no lasting peace without development, nor can\r\nthere be any possible development without established\r\npeace.\r\nIn this respect, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) constitutes a very promising\r\ninitiative, through which Africans are evincing the\r\ndetermination to take their destinies in hand. We must\r\nall respond in a way that it is up to their expectations.\r\nBut, also, Africans must make efforts themselves, and\r\nthis is the time for the developed countries to reassert\r\ntheir solidarity with regard to Africa’s fate.\r\nThis meeting, held within the framework of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, is an opportunity to do some\r\nstocktaking at the present time and to set some new\r\ntargets. As we look at the unique philosophy of\r\nNEPAD, namely partnership and ownership by\r\nAfricans themselves, then we can make a number of\r\npositive findings. First of all, NEPAD is a common\r\nproject for the whole of Africa, including North Africa.\r\nNext, institutions are being established through an\r\nImplementation Committee and a Steering Committee.\r\nFinally, many African heads of State are personally\r\ninvolving themselves in this approach. In particular, I\r\nwould like to pay tribute to Presidents Wade, Obasanjo,\r\nMbeki, Mubarak and Bouteflika.\r\nThis being so, we have every reason to be\r\noptimistic. Optimistic in the first place, with regard to\r\nthe excellence of African efforts in, because Africa, by\r\nmobilizing itself, makes NEPAD an essential element\r\nin the national, regional and international timetable.\r\nThe continent is establishing realistic and relevant\r\npriorities: infrastructures, education, water, the fight\r\nagainst poverty and good governance. Around these\r\njoint objectives, Africa is setting up a process for the\r\nevaluation of its efforts, the peer review mechanism.\r\nThe Africans are, therefore, setting the target to be\r\nachieved, as well as the methods to be followed.\r\nWe are also able to feel optimistic about the\r\napproach taken by of the developed countries. A\r\ngeneral recognition of the urgency of the fight against\r\npoverty is now coming to light. Taking careful note of\r\nthe favourable developments in Africa, the developed\r\ncountries are prepared to establish new relationships\r\nwith that continent, working within a partnership\r\napproach. The commitments made in Monterrey may\r\nlead to an increase in official development assistance,\r\njoining a broader mobilization of various agents, both\r\npublic and private.\r\nWhat are the prospects today? Well, the year that\r\nhas passed has been marked by a series of meetings\r\nthat converge towards the same focus. We need to\r\nbring about the practical implementation of NEPAD\r\nobjectives. We are now awaiting from our African\r\nfriends the establishment of precise priority objectives\r\nand an explication of the specific mechanisms that they\r\nwish to set up, as well as an explanation of the exact\r\nrole of the African Union.\r\nDevelopment constitutes an immense challenge.\r\nThe achievement of development requires that this\r\nmovement take deep root in Africa. Diplomatic\r\ndialogue is necessary, but it is not sufficient. Africans\r\nmust, therefore, mobilize all the dynamic forces in their\r\nsocieties in order to give specific form to their will.\r\nThe Kananaskis Summit of the Group of Eight\r\nindustrialized countries (G-8) launched a process. The\r\nG-8 Plan of Action for Africa initiates a response to\r\nNEPAD, defines the major themes and outlines ways to\r\naddress them. The developed countries must now abide\r\nby the Plan. The urgency today consists in fulfilling\r\nour commitments to forging a structured partnership\r\nbetween the North and South. France will be Chair of\r\nthe G-8 in 2003 and intends to use that year to make\r\nAfrica a priority and continue the work begun at\r\nKananaskis, with the goal of building a partnership that\r\nis generous, clear and determined, as the President of\r\nthe French Republic has expressed the wish to do.\r\nFrance will show its strength and determination at the\r\nG-8 Summit to be held in June 2003 at Evian-les-\r\nBains.\r\nWe intend to address two priorities. First, we\r\nintend to increase our official development assistance\r\nby 50 per cent over five years, to implement the\r\nMonterrey commitments. This effort will mainly be\r\ndevoted to Africa.\r\nSecondly, we wish to mobilize the private sector.\r\nThat is the entire meaning of the Franco-British\r\ninitiative announced by the President of the French\r\nRepublic and the British Prime Minister at the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held in\r\nJohannesburg. We will have a number of opportunities\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nto strengthen and clarify this dialogue with Africa: at\r\nthe Franco-African Conference, the Europe-Africa\r\nSummit and at the next G-8 Summit, making NEPAD a\r\ncentral theme. We need to arrive at a common reading\r\nof this partnership and its relationship with the G-8.\r\nSide by side with that, the concept of mutual\r\nresponsibility should provide a counterpoint to the\r\nAfrican peer review mechanism.\r\nWe are, I hope, at the dawn of a new era for\r\nAfrica. Through NEPAD, we have designed the\r\nnecessary tool. Now we must build it and use it. That is\r\nAfrica’s challenge as well as ours.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nFelipe Pérez Roque, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nCuba.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nCuba fully supports the emergence of a new alliance\r\nfor the development of Africa, conceived and managed\r\nby the African countries themselves. We have heard the\r\npronouncements of African leaders representing\r\npeoples with which we have fraternal ties, and which\r\nyesterday were the peoples of exploited colonies whose\r\nmost elementary human rights were violated over\r\ncenturies. We are reminded that only a few years ago,\r\nthere was no independent Namibia. There was no\r\nsecurity for the territorial integrity of Angola. And we\r\nwere saddened to see South Africa under the loathsome\r\napartheid regime. It moves me to recall memory of the\r\n350,000 Cubans who voluntarily went to Africa to fight\r\nagainst colonialism and apartheid, and especially the\r\nnearly 2,000 who died fighting for those ideals. We\r\nstill feel, with pride, the most prized of treasures: the\r\nwarmth and admiration offered to us by the African\r\npeoples.\r\nWe have the moral authority to speak at this\r\ngathering. We do not see Africa as a promised land for\r\ninvestments and easy profits, but rather as the land of\r\nour brethren to whom we owe much of our own history\r\nand culture. Almost 30,000 young Africans have been\r\neducated in Cuba. Over 3,000 are now studying under\r\nscholarships and fellowships in our country, more than\r\n1,000 of whom are embarking on medical careers.\r\nAlmost 1,000 Cuban doctors are today working free of\r\ncharge in rural areas in 12 African countries. We know\r\nwhat we are talking about, and our African brothers in\r\nthis Hall know the same.\r\nIn order for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) to have a future, we need the\r\nfollowing. First, Africa must have all its external debt\r\nforgiven. Today Africa is a net exporter of capital. If\r\nall African peoples stopped eating, clothing\r\nthemselves, being educated and having medical care\r\nfor an entire year, their entire gross national product\r\n(GNP) still would not be enough to pay their external\r\ndebt.\r\nSecondly, Africa needs special and diverse\r\ntreatment, access to markets and fair prices for its\r\nexports. Why is it that, despite its abundant and\r\nvaluable natural resources, Africa’s share of world\r\ntrade is only 2 per cent? Will the developed countries\r\naccept fair treatment for Africa at the next round of\r\nnegotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nor will they continue short-sightedly to protect the\r\nnarrow interests of their transnational companies?\r\nThirdly, Africa needs access to technology and to\r\nthe training of its human resources. Will the developed\r\ncountries stop robbing Africa of its talent, particularly\r\nnow, at the time when they are robbing even their\r\nathletes? Half of Africans do not have electricity, and\r\nthere are more telephones in Manhattan alone than in\r\nall of sub-Saharan Africa. What kind of development\r\nare we talking about? Does it mean anything for\r\nmillions of Africans to talk about things like electronic\r\ncommerce and cyberspace?\r\nFourthly, Africa needs additional financial\r\nresources without interference and with no\r\nconditionalities. Let us not forget that Africa is\r\nspending, today, four times more on servicing a\r\nconstantly growing external debt than on health and\r\neducation combined. As they criticize the problems of\r\nAfrica, do the G-8 leaders really think about the fact\r\nthat, in large measure, these problems stem from\r\ncenturies of colonialism and exploitation? Why do they\r\nnot set an example and give 0.7 per cent of GNP in\r\nofficial development assistance, to raise their own\r\ncontribution from 53 billion to 170 billion, if they\r\nknow that only 64 billion dollars per annum would be\r\nsufficient for the entire financial requirements of\r\nNEPAD?\r\nFifthly, in order for NEPAD to make sense and\r\nhave a future, Africa needs help in fighting HIV/AIDS.\r\nWill the more than 25 million Africans infected with\r\nthe AIDS virus be able one day to get appropriate\r\ntreatment? What future awaits the more than 13 million\r\nAfricans who have been orphaned as a result of\r\nHIV/AIDS?\r\n31\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nLet me repeat Cuba’s offer to send 4,000 Cuban\r\ndoctors and medical personnel to Africa to create the\r\ninfrastructure that will make it possible to care for the\r\npopulation, with the medications, prescriptions and\r\nfollow-up they need. They would help also with the\r\ntraining of human resources. Deeds, not words, are\r\nwhat Africa needs: firm commitments, not rhetoric; and\r\nhumble acceptance of the historical debt owed to\r\nAfrica by those who gained and still gain from the\r\nexploitation of Africa. There are dozens of countries in\r\nthis Hall that should make such a commitment. Will\r\nthey decide to give up some of their privileges to\r\ncontribute financial resources to NEPAD? That is the\r\nquestion.\r\nIf these actions that I am calling for are not taken,\r\nall the rest will be mere good intentions, vague\r\npromises and new frustrations.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nAnatoliy Zlenko, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nUkraine.\r\nMr. Zlenko (Ukraine): I am pleased to address\r\nthis high level meeting of the General Assembly on the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\non behalf of a country which has a long history of\r\nfriendship and partnership with Africa. That history\r\ndates back to the time of our concerted action to\r\neradicate colonialism and apartheid, and it continues\r\nwith our joint efforts aimed at resolving conflicts and\r\npromoting development in Africa.\r\nUkraine welcomes the establishment of the\r\nAfrican Union as a historic step taken by the peoples of\r\nAfrica, clearly recognizing that their strength lies in\r\ntheir unity. We hope that the African Union will\r\nbecome a driving force in promoting peace and\r\nstability, democracy and good governance, the rule of\r\nlaw and sustainable development for the countries of\r\nthe continent.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the high-level\r\nintergovernmental meeting of African Union member\r\nStates on the prevention and combating of terrorism,\r\njust held at Algiers from 11 to 14 September. The\r\nUkraine commends and supports the initiative of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development as a logical\r\ncontinuation and reflection of the commitment of\r\nAfrican countries to achieve stability and economic\r\ngrowth all over their continent.\r\nWe believe that the underlying principles\r\nof NEPAD — ownership, partnership and\r\nresponsibility — provide a strong foundation to reach\r\nthat noble goal. All of us present in this Hall realize\r\nthat the success of NEPAD can be ensured only if the\r\ninitiative is put into action on the basis of a strong\r\nAfrican consensus and sound international support.\r\nToday, Africa bears the heaviest burden in the\r\nchallenges of the contemporary world, the worst of\r\nwhich are armed conflicts, poverty and HIV/AIDS.\r\nThese challenges represent major impediments on the\r\npath to achieving the goals which were set out by the\r\nworld leaders at the Millennium Summit, at Monterrey\r\nand at Johannesburg. It is our shared responsibility to\r\nhelp African peoples in their pursuit of lasting peace\r\nand sustainable development.\r\nWe highly appreciate and support the efforts of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan in mobilizing\r\ninternational assistance and promoting cooperation to\r\nbenefit the peoples of Africa. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations has an important role to play in the\r\nNew Partnership and that it should be provided with\r\nthe necessary means and tools to carry out its activities\r\nfor Africa in the most effective way. My country has\r\nalways been committed to the objectives of peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa. That commitment has been\r\nconfirmed by the substantial participation of Ukraine in\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa, as\r\nwell as by continuing efforts to expand and foster\r\nbilateral trade and economic relations with African\r\ncountries.\r\nUkraine’s interest in developing strong and\r\nmutually beneficial partnerships with the African\r\ncountries was recently reaffirmed by the President of\r\nUkraine, Leonid Kuchma, during his meetings with\r\nAfrican leaders in Johannesburg. Ukraine stands ready\r\nto make a constructive contribution to the process of\r\nNEPAD implementation. In particular, we are ready to\r\nparticipate in bilateral and multilateral cooperation\r\nprogrammes for specific sectorial NEPAD priorities,\r\nwhich could include the spheres of education,\r\nagriculture and transportation.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Ukraine’s\r\ncommitment to support African development efforts in\r\na spirit of true partnership and mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation. We are convinced that with the concerted\r\nefforts of the international community, NEPAD will\r\nbecome a success story for Africa.\r\n32\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Blas Ople, Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Ople (Philippines): The global victory over\r\napartheid was won through the leadership,\r\ndetermination and sacrifice of the African people.\r\nToday, there is once again a need to call on that same\r\nresolve to win the battle for development. The road\r\nmap to accomplish this is the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), and one major force\r\nfor its realization is the newly organized African\r\nUnion. We thus wish the African Union the best in its\r\nquest for sustainable growth and development. We\r\nknow it is capable of reaching for no less than\r\ngreatness.\r\nMajor developments in the world put the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries at the forefront. In Monterrey, we\r\nestablished a new consensus model of development\r\nthat takes into account all parts of the development\r\nequation, including the needs and priorities of\r\ndeveloping countries. In Johannesburg, we concluded\r\nour 10-year review of the 1992 United Nations\r\nConference on Environment and Development at the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, which,\r\naccording to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, opened a\r\nnew chapter of responsibility, partnership and\r\nimplementation.\r\nWhile global developments favouring growth are\r\nimportant, regional cooperation will be indispensable.\r\nWe learned this in the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN), and our modest success could serve\r\nas a model to help Africa overcome the enormous\r\nchallenges that it faces, particularly in connection with\r\nfactors that hinder effective regional cooperation and\r\nintegration. The African Foreign Ministers I have met\r\nin New York agree that Africa and ASEAN should\r\nforge stronger ties. Indeed we should, for there is much\r\nthat we can learn from each other. We will do our part,\r\nbut developed partners must also extend all possible\r\nassistance to African countries in order to strengthen\r\nkey institutions, such as the civil service, the judiciary,\r\nthe business sector and civil society.\r\nSouth-South cooperation can also play a pivotal\r\nrole and should therefore be vigorously promoted and\r\npursued. In this area, the Philippines can share its\r\nexperiences, including its positive and progressive\r\nrecord of Government partnership with all\r\nstakeholders, including the business sector and civil\r\nsociety. The Philippines has held very preliminary\r\ndiscussions with donor countries on providing joint\r\ntechnical assistance to Africa, especially in capacity\r\nbuilding. I am confident that our talks will bear fruit.\r\nGlobalization must not marginalize millions in\r\nAfrica. It is imperative that the flow of aid to the\r\ncontinent be stable and predictable. We therefore, once\r\nagain, urge all developed partners to meet the aid target\r\nof 0.7 per cent of gross national product (GNP), and we\r\ncommend those that have already done so. Greater\r\naccess of African products to global markets is also\r\nneeded. The international community must remain\r\nserious about debt relief. We thus support the enhanced\r\nHighly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\r\nDevelopment is a dividend of peace. We will also\r\nsupport every effort to bring peace and stability to\r\nAfrica. From efforts to stem the flow of illicit small\r\narms to efforts to resolve existing conflicts and prevent\r\nnew ones, the Philippines will be one with the rest of\r\nthe international community.\r\nWe were with Africans when they struck down\r\nthe monster that was apartheid. We will be with them\r\nas they rise up and claim the fruits of growth, progress\r\nand development that they so rightly deserve.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mohamed Benaissa, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco.\r\nMr. Benaissa (Morocco) (spoke in French): I\r\nwould like first, Mr. President, to thank you for\r\norganizing this meeting on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which once again\r\nplaces Africa at the centre of the attention of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and of the whole of the international\r\ncommunity. As a member of the African family,\r\nMorocco cannot fail to welcome the holding of this\r\ndebate, only a few days before the final review of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s.\r\nIn order to take charge of its own affairs, the\r\nAfrican continent took the initiative by devising\r\nNEPAD, a programme for the social, economic and\r\npolitical development of the continent, and also a\r\nframework for cooperation and partnership with\r\nAfrica’s friends. NEPAD is thus a starting point for\r\nintegrated development. Its implementation will\r\ndepend on the political will of each African country to\r\n33\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nadapt it to its own policies while preparing a propitious\r\nenvironment for sustainable development.\r\nIt goes without saying that the United Nations,\r\nthrough its principal organs — the General Assembly,\r\nthe Security Council and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil — will be called upon to play a central role in\r\nthe success of NEPAD. It would therefore appear of\r\nparamount importance that we determine the ways and\r\nmeans for United Nations engagement in this\r\npartnership.\r\nIf the tools for coordination and programming of\r\nthe United Nations system are to be put at the service\r\nof dialogue and cooperation with the African countries,\r\nthe major challenge consists of adopting those tools\r\nand mechanisms to NEPAD and to the national\r\npriorities of the countries concerned. Of course,\r\ninternational and regional funding institutions which,\r\nfor their part, possess tools for cooperation and\r\nassistance in Africa, should coordinate their efforts\r\nwith the United Nations for the benefit of Africa.\r\nIf the funding of NEPAD is the greatest challenge\r\nfor the African countries to meet, the main task for the\r\nUnited Nations is pleading the cause of Africa before\r\nthe financial backers, donors, businesses and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in order to facilitate new\r\nmodels of cooperation based on partnerships and\r\nshared responsibilities.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the support and\r\ncommitment to NEPAD demonstrated by the Group of\r\nEight (G-8), the World Bank and the International\r\nMonetary Fund. We express the hope that this support\r\nwill result in concrete measures and new forms of\r\ncooperation and partnership.\r\nWe would also like to underline that the success\r\nof NEPAD necessarily and especially involves\r\nstrengthening international economic cooperation,\r\ncoherence among economic, trade and financial\r\npolicies and the improvement of access for African\r\nexports to the markets of the wealthy countries, thus\r\nmaking it possible to free up sufficient resources to\r\nfinance economic and social development initiatives.\r\nAlso, particular attention should be given to the\r\nproblems of the heavily-indebted countries in order to\r\nrethink the debt problem, through cancellation or\r\nrescheduling. Debt servicing, in fact, continues to\r\nabsorb enormous financial resources of the African\r\ncountries.\r\nAs for Morocco, His Majesty King Mohammed\r\nVI announced at the Cairo Euro-African Summit a\r\ndecision to cancel the external debt of the least\r\ndeveloped African countries and to open Morocco’s\r\nmarkets to the exports of those countries. Those\r\nmeasures have made it possible to reinforce economic\r\nand trade relations between Morocco and the other\r\nAfrican countries and will contribute to the\r\nachievement of the objectives of NEPAD.\r\nAs well, the private sector is increasingly being\r\noriented towards African markets. Moroccan\r\ninvestment is very present in many countries of the\r\nregion, especially through joint ventures, which have\r\nproved a promising instrument for promoting the\r\nintegration of African economies.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco’s commitment to\r\ndevelopment and stability in Africa is reflected in its\r\nconstant and multifaceted contribution to the allaying\r\nof tensions and to the peaceful settlement of conflicts\r\nin Africa. My country will remain faithful to that\r\ncommitment so that our continent may cease to be\r\nmarginalized and may fully assume its role on the\r\ninternational scene.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Morshed Khan, Foreign\r\nMinister of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Khan (Bangladesh): I am happy to be here at\r\nthis high-level meeting deliberating on Africa. For I\r\nhave seen for myself the challenges that many fellow\r\nnations in that continent face today, whether it be\r\nending armed conflicts, rebuilding societies ravaged by\r\nwar or struggling for social and economic progress in\r\nthe face of internal or external adversity.\r\nThe United Nations, the international community\r\nand African nations themselves have long been aware\r\nof Africa’s problems and needs. The report of the Club\r\nof Rome in the 1970s and the report of the South\r\nCommission that President Mwalimu Nyerere headed\r\nin 1990 both highlighted Africa’s urgent needs. The\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) was precisely an\r\nattempt to address Africa’s multifaceted challenges.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s assessment that\r\nthere are a number of important lessons to be learnt\r\nfrom UN-NADAF’s journey: that development\r\ncooperation with Africa requires a new orientation; that\r\nthe international community should honour its\r\n34\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\ncommitments; that strengthened advocacy remains\r\nessential for Africa’s development; and that peace and\r\nsecurity are essential preconditions for Africa’s\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe central lesson is to own the development\r\nstrategies. The launching of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) in July 2001 and its\r\nadoption by the African Union last month affirmed\r\nthat. By all measures, African leaders deserve to be\r\ncommended for effectively articulating their problems\r\nand envisioning ways of addressing them.\r\nBangladesh has been involved in the United\r\nNations efforts in Africa in the areas of both peace and\r\ndevelopment. In the case of Sierra Leone, allow me to\r\nmention that Bangladesh went in where others were\r\nleaving when the United Nations Mission was in\r\njeopardy.\r\nI myself was in Sierra Leone just this summer.\r\nAnd I must tell you how gratifying it was to see a\r\nfellow developing nation emerging from one of the\r\nbloodiest of civil wars. I saw the ravages of the civil\r\nwar in Lungi, Lunsar, Magburaka and Freetown. I also\r\nsaw the determination of the people to rebuild their\r\nown country. The visit reaffirmed my conviction of our\r\nresponsibility to act, of our individual and collective\r\ncapacity to address such conflicts and of the strength of\r\nthis Organization.\r\nThere has hardly been a United Nations\r\npeacekeeping mission in Africa in the last two decades\r\nin which Bangladesh did not participate. We sent our\r\npeacekeepers to even the most dangerous theatres. We\r\ndid this in keeping with our Charter commitment and in\r\nthe spirit of solidarity with our African brethren.\r\nAfrican conflicts have dominated the Security\r\nCouncil agenda in the past years. As a member of the\r\nCouncil, Bangladesh pursued a policy of activism,\r\npleaded greater United Nations engagement and tried\r\nto match her political commitment with her presence in\r\nthe field. Conflict prevention constitutes a major\r\nelement in the entire African agenda. Bangladesh\r\nplayed a lead role in ensuring follow-up to the\r\nSecretary-General’s seminal report on the prevention of\r\narmed conflict. Bangladesh continues to play an active\r\nrole on the matter in the General Assembly.\r\nIn development and in peace, Bangladesh, as a\r\nmember of the Group of 77, of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and of the least developed countries, walks\r\nwith fellow African nations when approaching issues.\r\nWe recognize that while conflicts impede development,\r\nmany of Africa’s conflicts are rooted in endemic\r\npoverty, underdevelopment and a weak institutional\r\nbasis for development.\r\nRecognizing this inevitably takes us to what was\r\nunderscored at the Third United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Least Developed Countries, held last year. The\r\nBrussels Declaration and Programme of Action for the\r\nLeast Developed Countries outline a menu of actions to\r\nbe implemented by the international community to\r\naddress the socio-economic challenges facing the 49\r\nmost impoverished countries, 34 of which are in\r\nAfrica. Fulfilment of the commitments of the\r\nProgramme of Action will go a long way in addressing\r\nAfrica’s problems.\r\nAs Africa marches ahead to address its own\r\nchallenges, we have a moral responsibility to extend\r\nour hands in cooperation to Africa. The trend of a\r\ndeclining flow of resources into Africa must be\r\nreversed. An effective solution to Africa’s extremely\r\ndaunting debt problem cannot wait any longer. Above\r\nall, Africa’s economies need to be rebuilt, and access\r\nfor Africa’s exports to markets outside Africa should\r\nbe ensured. These are but a few of the things expected\r\nof us. I am certain that the international community\r\nwill come forward in Africa’s aid.\r\nWithin the framework of South-South\r\ncooperation, countries like Bangladesh can and will\r\nstrive to meaningfully contribute to Africa’s rebuilding.\r\nOver the years, Bangladesh has experimented with a\r\nnumber of innovative approaches to development, such\r\nas microcredit to address extreme poverty and\r\nempower our women, and creating social safety nets\r\nfor the needy. Involving non-governmental\r\norganizations and all civil society actors, we have been\r\nable to strengthen our institutions and deliver broad-\r\nbased social sector programmes. We remain ready to\r\nshare our experience in all these areas with our African\r\nbrothers and sisters.\r\nNEPAD is based on a new vision for Africa.\r\nAddressing extreme poverty is obviously a strategic\r\nchoice at the heart of NEPAD. It also is based on the\r\nrealization that progress in developing Africa cannot be\r\nachieved without the social and economic\r\nemancipation of a majority of its long-neglected\r\nnations. Let us resolve to address precisely that\r\nchallenge.\r\n35\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Allan Wagner Tizón, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Peru.\r\nMr. Wagner Tizón (Peru) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nPeru is pleased to participate in this important\r\ngathering, which seeks to mobilize the support of the\r\ninternational community for the peace, progress and\r\nsustainable development of the African continent. Our\r\npresence here reflects not only that we share the status\r\nof developing countries, but also that we are heirs to\r\nthat continent’s cultural and human wealth. For more\r\nthan four centuries, Africa’s contribution to all areas\r\nhas been a central element of our national identity.\r\nPeru welcomes the establishment of the African\r\nUnion and of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) as specific, effective and bold\r\nsteps towards resolving, in a collective, serious and\r\nresponsible way, the problems afflicting African\r\ncountries on the basis of their own thinking and a\r\ncommon commitment.\r\nMy country took an active part in the\r\ninternational support for the struggle against apartheid\r\nand for Namibia’s independence, and it has followed\r\nclosely the major developments that have been\r\noccurring on the African continent. We have\r\ncooperated in every possible way with United Nations\r\nefforts to promote peace and development on that\r\ncontinent. We participate in the Working Group on the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa. At the most\r\nrecent session of the Economic and Social Council, we\r\nsupported the creation of an ad hoc advisory group on\r\nAfrican countries emerging from conflict situations.\r\nIn the past few months, we have welcomed the\r\npositive results achieved by various peace-building\r\nprocesses on the continent as a result of real political\r\nwill and the desire of the Governments and the people\r\nof Africa to build their future on the basis of dialogue\r\nand cooperation. My country takes pride in having\r\ntaken part and in continuing to take part in those efforts\r\nthrough its participation in peacekeeping operations in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Eritrea\r\nand Ethiopia.\r\nMy country would like to emphasize the\r\ncommitment undertaken by African leaders in NEPAD\r\nwith regard to strengthening democracy and promoting\r\nhuman rights, including the fostering of transparency\r\nand accountability among those in Government. Peru\r\nfully upholds the paramount importance of democracy,\r\nwhich we consider to be a right of peoples that is\r\ndirectly linked to sustainable development.\r\nThese premises are enshrined in the Inter-\r\nAmerican Democratic Charter, adopted within the\r\nframework of the Organization of American States.\r\nThe President of Peru, Mr. Alejandro Toledo, was\r\nunable to be present at this session, as he would have\r\nwished, because he was in Washington to\r\ncommemorate the anniversary of the adoption of that\r\ndocument, so central to inter-American relations. My\r\ncountry stands ready to cooperate with Africa’s States\r\nand regional organizations to share this important\r\nexperience, both in its management and in the positive\r\napplication of its initial results.\r\nPeru also agrees with NEPAD’s vision, which\r\nvalues the necessity of strengthening and revitalizing\r\nsocial sectors such as education and health —\r\nespecially as it applies to HIV/AIDS — as well as the\r\nrecognition of a leading role for the private sector.\r\nAware of the need to invest for the future, my country\r\nhas been promoting, at the Latin American level, a\r\nproposal designed to effectively and gradually limit\r\ndefence spending, which would permit the reallocation\r\nof those resources towards social spending and public\r\nwelfare. It is obvious that these efforts require in turn a\r\nconcrete commitment on the part of developed\r\ncountries that will allow the channelling of such\r\ninitiatives towards real results.\r\nFinally, I should like to stress that any strategy\r\nfor sustainable development, no matter how well\r\nconceived, will not attain the desired results and\r\nobjectives if there is no effective increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance or real opening of the markets\r\nof developed countries. These principles, which my\r\ncountry fully supports, were reaffirmed and\r\nstrengthened at the recent international summits at\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg. We hope that they will\r\nbecome reality for the benefit of all developing\r\ncountries, especially the least developed countries of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Yashwant Sinha, the\r\nMinister for External Affairs of India.\r\nMr. Sinha (India): I am happy to participate and\r\nto represent India in this high-level plenary meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). Crafting partnerships\r\n36\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\namong African countries themselves and between\r\nAfrica and the rest of the international community is at\r\nthe core of NEPAD.\r\nBy virtue of the abundance of its natural\r\nresources and the capacity of its peoples to be agents of\r\nchange, Africa holds the key to its own development.\r\nThe process of African development, however, like any\r\nother process, requires venture capital. NEPAD\r\nprovides the prospectus for a new listing, and we\r\nconclude, having studied it carefully, that the venture\r\npromises to be mutually beneficial. We expect that\r\nAfrica will benefit and that the return on investment\r\nwill be manifold. In our view, the market has every\r\nreason to be bullish on NEPAD.\r\nIn NEPAD, Africa has accorded the highest\r\npriority to democracy. Like India, it sees democracy as\r\na moral imperative. Democracy provides the basis for\r\ndurable peace and stability. Conflict and instability are\r\nanathema to economic development. Democracy is,\r\ntherefore, a necessary condition for progress and\r\nprosperity. Democracy, however, does not provide an\r\ninstant recipe for economic salvation. Economic\r\ndevelopment requires, in addition, sound economic\r\npolicies. And sound policies — in fact, the only\r\nworkable policies, economic or political — are those\r\nthat are chosen by the people themselves.\r\nThe independent evaluation of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s found that the liberalization, the privatization\r\nand the market-based reforms pursued by many African\r\ncountries in the 1990s did help to improve their\r\nmacroeconomic situation. The adjustment programmes,\r\nhowever, failed to restore economic growth and had\r\nadverse effects on social conditions. Overriding\r\nreliance on liberalization, privatization and market-\r\nbased reforms has, in many cases, proved\r\ncounterproductive to accelerating development and\r\nalleviating poverty.\r\nIn the past, Africa has had policies imposed from\r\noutside. National ownership is not a mere principle to\r\nbe paid lip service. The restriction of democratic space\r\nis not only morally unacceptable; it is also, we find,\r\neconomically and socially counterproductive and often\r\nproves to be disastrous.\r\nThis, in our view, is a principal lesson which the\r\ninternational community needs to learn from the\r\nexperiences of the past.\r\nWe are gratified at the significant increase in the\r\nvolume, quality and scope of South-South cooperation\r\nbetween Africa and the rest of the developing world.\r\nIndia has been particularly active in investment and in\r\nvarious forms of technical cooperation arrangements\r\nwith African countries. An important reason for this\r\nsuccess is perhaps the relevance and appropriateness of\r\nthe Indian development experience to Africa.\r\nIndia’s relationship with Africa is built on strong\r\nhistorical and political foundations. It has been our\r\nobjective, for the last four decades, also to impart\r\nsubstantive economic content to this relationship. Over\r\nthe past decades, we have provided more than $2\r\nbillion in technical assistance to the countries of the\r\nSouth. More than 1,400 representatives of developing\r\ncountries, the majority from Africa, are provided\r\ntraining every year under the Indian Technical and\r\nEconomic Cooperation Programme. Also, at any time,\r\nwe are host to around 10,000 African students in our\r\ncountry. We are happy, through this programme, to be\r\nable to contribute to capacity-building in Africa.\r\nTrade between India and sub-Saharan Africa has\r\nincreased by almost 300 per cent over the last nine\r\nyears. We are determined to maintain and improve this\r\nrate of growth. India’s Ministry of Commerce and\r\nIndustry has therefore launched a “Focus Africa”\r\nprogramme this year. We attach particular importance\r\nto the promotion of private-sector linkages and have\r\ninitiated training programmes for private-sector\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn July this year, a conference on India and\r\nNEPAD was held in New Delhi that brought together\r\nrepresentatives of Indian industry and financial\r\ninstitutions and their partners in Africa. The conference\r\naddressed, among other issues, the question of\r\nimproving utilization of the lines of credit extended by\r\nIndia to many countries in Africa. We have set for\r\nourselves a target of $200 million in credit, to be made\r\navailable in the next year.\r\nIndia is ready for NEPAD.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Luvsangiin Erdenechuluun, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Mongolia.\r\n37\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nMr. Erdenechuluun (Mongolia): It gives me\r\ngreat pleasure to address this high-level plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly which is considering\r\nthe timely issue of rendering all-round support to an\r\nextremely important new initiative of the African\r\nleaders, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nAs many may recall, the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\nwas adopted by the General Assembly in 1991. The\r\nNew Agenda set a desirable target of an average real\r\ngrowth rate of at least 6 per cent per annum of the\r\ngross national product for Africa. However, a growth\r\nrate of about 3 per cent was recorded throughout the\r\ndecade, far below the growth rate necessary to attain\r\nthe poverty-reduction targets set by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nDeclining official development assistance to\r\nAfrica and indebtedness were cited among the main\r\nreasons. Official development assistance to Africa,\r\nwhich was $28.62 billion in 1990, fell to $16.38 billion\r\nin 2000. The failure to achieve the target was in some\r\ncases attributed to over-reliance on certain measures\r\nand market-based reforms, which in many instances\r\nproved to be counterproductive and did not bring the\r\ndesired results.\r\nAt the same time, in the 1990s African countries\r\nmade significant strides in the process of\r\ndemocratization. Popular elections were held in many\r\ncountries. Democratic systems of government, the rule\r\nof law, freedom of speech and human rights have\r\nbecome the quest of a young generation of African\r\nleaders.\r\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU) at that\r\ntime in its turn took the lead in introducing democratic\r\nchanges in its member countries. It also took active\r\nsteps to strengthen its conflict resolution and\r\nprevention capabilities.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nOne of the most important lessons learned from\r\nthe past decade has been the inseparable link between\r\npeace and security as well as economic development\r\nand social progress. It is now widely recognized that\r\nsecuring peace and tranquillity for the sake of\r\neconomic progress is the highest priority and the\r\nprimary responsibility of all the African countries,\r\nindividually and collectively.\r\nThere are many conflicts in Africa that remain\r\nunresolved, while others now dormant could flare up at\r\nany moment. Africa, which has suffered too long from\r\narmed conflicts, is at present, with the support of the\r\ninternational community, seriously engaged in\r\nresolving numerous conflicts in many parts of the\r\ncontinent, including the Great Lakes region. My\r\ndelegation wishes every success to Africa in\r\naccomplishing this difficult, impending task.\r\nAt this new stage of international development\r\ncooperation in support of Africa, the leaders of Africa,\r\ntaking stock of the lessons of the past, undertook a\r\nmajor revision of the philosophy of the development of\r\nthe continent. Mongolia therefore expresses its firm\r\nsupport for the creation of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development.\r\nNEPAD represents a comprehensive blueprint of,\r\nand a growth vision for, Africa’s future economic and\r\nsocial development. It is an Africa-led, owned and\r\nmanaged initiative, as described in the draft United\r\nNations Declaration on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development, contained in document\r\nA/57/L.2/Rev.1, of which Mongolia is a sponsor.\r\nNEPAD not only contains a broad framework of\r\nprinciples that will serve as guidelines for country-\r\nlevel planning and execution. It provides the general\r\nframework of principles for sound economic policies\r\nand management, and for transparent, accountable and\r\ndemocratic governance. It also provides a forum for\r\ndialogue between African political leadership and the\r\nGroup of Eight on issues related to African\r\ndevelopment, including aid adequacy, trade access and\r\ndebt relief.\r\nMy delegation shares the view of the Panel of\r\nEminent Personalities that the Secretary-General, the\r\nPresident of the World Bank, the Managing Director of\r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development (OECD) may be included to broaden\r\nthis dialogue.\r\nNEPAD was designed by Africans for Africans,\r\nbased on the lessons of the past decade. The African\r\ncountries committed themselves to taking effective\r\nmeasures for its implementation. The initiative has\r\n38\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nalready won widespread endorsement by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMy delegation is confident that this important\r\ninitiative will receive the generous support of the\r\ninternational donor community and will achieve the\r\ntargets set for the African renaissance. I therefore\r\nappeal to all representatives to lend their valuable\r\nsupport to the draft Declaration contained in document\r\nA/57/L.2/Rev.1.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Mr. Anil\r\nKumarsingh Gayan, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nRegional Cooperation of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Gayan (Mauritius): I wish first of all to\r\nthank the General Assembly for holding this High-\r\nLevel Plenary Meeting on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). This provides Africa\r\nand the international community with an opportunity to\r\ngive substance to the partnership which we all expect\r\nwill put Africa on the path of recovery.\r\nNEPAD, which is an economic programme of the\r\nAfrican Union, is an inclusive one, covering the whole\r\nmembership from the continent to the island States of\r\nthe Union.\r\nNEPAD is the vision of African leaders to address\r\nthe political, economic and social as well as the\r\necological challenges which the continent is facing.\r\nNEPAD embodies not only the hopes and ideals of\r\nAfricans and their leaders but also their determination\r\nto have a new paradigm for Africa.\r\nThe Declaration on Political, Economic and\r\nCorporate Governance and the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism show that we have decided that business in\r\nAfrica will no longer be business as usual. They are a\r\nsolemn pledge on our part that we shall not be found\r\nwanting in the observance of these norms. We do,\r\nhowever, recognize that urgency is of the essence and\r\nthat we cannot afford to lose any time. The challenges\r\nwe confront are enormous, but we have agreed to be\r\nassessed and to be judged by the fate of NEPAD. The\r\npoverty that confronts us and every other human being\r\nin the world cannot continue. The time to act is now.\r\nTomorrow might be too late.\r\nSince there have been many plans for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment in the past, NEPAD might be subject to a\r\ndegree of cynicism and déjà vu. We are, however, of\r\nthe view that NEPAD is not just another plan; it is an\r\nAfrican plan designed by Africans in order to meet\r\nachievable targets over set time frames. We are\r\ndetermined to prove the cynics wrong and to\r\naccompany NEPAD in meeting the goals and targets\r\nagreed at the Millennium Summit.\r\nAs a member of the Implementation Committee,\r\nMauritius believes that the success of NEPAD depends\r\non the involvement of the totality of the international\r\ncommunity. Peace and security in the world can be\r\nrealized only when children in Africa can realistically\r\nlook to a brighter future. We urge the international\r\ncommunity to welcome NEPAD and to support it\r\nwholeheartedly in order to rescue Africa.\r\nWe are encouraged by some recent developments.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus in respect of additional\r\nresources in official development assistance, the\r\nendorsement of NEPAD and the adoption of an Action\r\nPlan for Africa at the G-8 Summit in Kananaskis, and\r\nthe pronouncements at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development on eradicating poverty are\r\nvery positive signals.\r\nWe note that the final review and appraisal of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) will take place\r\nduring the current session of the General Assembly.\r\nThis should not mark the end of United Nations\r\nsupport for Africa. The United Nations system has the\r\nmoral and political authority to accelerate the process\r\nof building partnerships for Africa’s development. A\r\nsystem-wide United Nations coordinating framework\r\nwill have to be developed to improve the effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations support for NEPAD. This could\r\nbe largely facilitated through a United Nations focal\r\npoint, both in New York and at the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa, in Addis Ababa.\r\nGovernance is critical to the success of NEPAD.\r\nGood political governance and respect for the rule of\r\nlaw and for human rights go hand in hand with good\r\ncorporate governance. Since the role of the private\r\nsector will be very important for NEPAD’s\r\nimplementation, we are confident that the private\r\nsector will look at the potential of, and in, Africa in\r\nterms of an association spanning decades rather than\r\nmonths or years.\r\nAfrica is ready for business, and the architecture\r\nof NEPAD is ideal to attract foreign direct investment.\r\nWhile we are determined to make a success of NEPAD,\r\nwe urge donor countries to be patient and to understand\r\n39\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nthat reversing the governance and management pattern\r\nof the past will take some time. Although we shall not\r\nflinch from the objective, we are aware that there may\r\nbe occasional accidents. But this should not be held up\r\nas an excuse to inflict collective punishment upon\r\nAfrica.\r\nWe have agreed to be judged by our declarations\r\nand undertakings. We shall assume full responsibility\r\nfor any shortcoming or failure, since we are painfully\r\naware that the time to bring a glimmer of hope to\r\nmillions of Africans was yesterday. With the dawn of a\r\nday when there is a radiant smile on the face of every\r\nAfrican baby, boy or girl, then we will be able to say\r\nthat the commitment we are showing today has started\r\nto be operationalized. We cannot fail, because we\r\ncannot afford to fail.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Her Excellency\r\nMrs. Carolina Barco Isakson, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Colombia.\r\nMrs. Barco Isakson (Colombia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The delegation of Colombia welcomes the\r\nholding of this plenary meeting of the General\r\nAssembly as part of the process of assessing and\r\nguiding the efforts of the United Nations with regard to\r\nAfrica’s development.\r\nEnsuring that Africa enjoys the benefits of peace,\r\nindependence and development is a historic\r\ncommitment of the Organization. Let us recall here the\r\nachievements of decolonization; South Africa’s\r\nliberation from the yoke of apartheid; the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s; and peacekeeping missions throughout the\r\ncontinent. United Nations efforts in those fields\r\nconstitute a legacy belonging to all States Members of\r\nthe Organization, a legacy in which we all see\r\nourselves reflected. In participating in this debate, my\r\ncountry therefore reaffirms its conviction that the\r\nUnited Nations must respond to the special needs of\r\nAfrica and work towards its successful integration into\r\nthe mainstream of globalization, as agreed by our heads\r\nof State in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe welcome the opportunity to hear the clear\r\nvoice of Africa in this Hall, which is presenting to the\r\nrest of the world its aspirations to economic and social\r\ndevelopment, to democracy with transparency in public\r\nadministration and to peace and security throughout the\r\ncontinent. These are the ideas enshrined in the\r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union and in the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The\r\nelements of the NEPAD strategy will become binding\r\npoints of reference for Colombia, as they should\r\nbecome for the United Nations in its efforts to bridge\r\nthe gap between the countries of the North and of the\r\nSouth, and between Africa and the rest of the world.\r\nIn NEPAD my country sees the vision and efforts\r\nof African countries themselves to guide their\r\ndevelopment. We believe that is the most appropriate\r\nway to eliminate the disadvantageous effects of\r\nexternal assistance. For better or worse, the African\r\nrenaissance does not depend only on the mere wish of\r\ntheir rulers and social leaders to act. There is much that\r\nthe international community can contribute in terms of\r\nhuman, technical and financial resources. We should\r\nsingle out in particular the political decision to\r\nestablish a mechanism for NEPAD’s members\r\nthemselves to evaluate their compliance with the\r\nprogramme’s goals — the Peer Review Mechanism —\r\nas an original, well-intentioned and courageous\r\nmeasure. The United Nations and other international\r\norganizations must respond to the peoples of Africa\r\nwith an approach based on this new reality.\r\nWe think it appropriate that the General\r\nAssembly has decided to set aside time during its fifty-\r\nseventh session for special meetings on a final review\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF)\r\nand, concurrently, to assess the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the 1998 report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of development in Africa (A/52/871).\r\nAllow me to mention that during the 20 months\r\nthat Colombia has been a non-permanent member of\r\nthe Security Council, we have contributed to keeping\r\nthe United Nations engaged in the settlement of various\r\nconflicts affecting the continent today. Through our\r\ncontacts with African leaders and our participation in\r\nthree Security Council missions to Africa, we have a\r\nbetter understanding of the dilemmas of peace and\r\ndevelopment faced by Africa’s peoples. It is clear to us\r\nthat without peace there can be no development, no\r\nintegration into the rest of the world and no future for a\r\nsociety.\r\nOn this solemn occasion, Colombia wishes to\r\nreiterate its determination to work with other countries\r\nat the United Nations to focus the attention of the\r\n40\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\nOrganization and the international community on the\r\naspirations set down by the African peoples in the\r\nConstitutive Act of the African Union and in their New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Mikhail Khvostov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nthe Republic of Belarus.\r\nMr. Khvostov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): In\r\ntoday’s interdependent world, no member of the\r\ninternational community can remain indifferent to the\r\nproblems faced by entire continents. The Republic of\r\nBelarus fully supports United Nations efforts to assist\r\nAfrica as it tries to break free from the grip of the\r\npoverty, conflict and backwardness inherited from the\r\nera of colonialism and global political confrontation.\r\nBelarus welcomes the implementation of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), an\r\ninitiative developed by African States themselves. The\r\nfact that the international community has responded\r\npositively to that initiative and is providing practical\r\nassistance for its implementation is grounds for hope\r\nthat the continent will be transformed into a dynamic\r\nregion where confrontation between Powers and blocs\r\nwill give way to close cooperation between all States\r\nMembers of the United Nations for the benefit of\r\nAfrican nations.\r\nLooking back at history, it is clear that recent\r\nglobal ideological confrontation resulted in funds being\r\ndiverted from development needs. When that\r\nconfrontation came to an end, a number of young\r\nStates had to re-evaluate their role and their place in\r\nthe current system of international relations. Cold-war\r\nstereotypes having been done away with, we now have\r\na more active model of relations for comprehensive\r\ncooperation with African States. The partnership with\r\nAfrica is of great importance for Belarus. We are\r\ncounting on reciprocity from our African partners in\r\nour efforts to develop cooperation with Africa.\r\nOver the past few years, Belarus has intensified\r\nits cooperation with the countries of the region, having\r\nbecome a full-fledged member of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. This cooperation is mutually beneficial and\r\nis aimed, first and foremost, at resolving the most\r\npressing problems faced by Africa.\r\nMy country fully shares the central objectives of\r\nNEPAD aimed at achieving the economic restoration\r\nand revival of African countries, advancing their\r\ngovernmental systems, strengthening peace and\r\nsecurity on the continent, improving the economic\r\ninfrastructure and creating conditions for sustainable\r\ndevelopment there.\r\nThe emergence of NEPAD, which coincided with\r\nthe transformation of the Organization of African Unity\r\ninto the African Union, is testimony to the seriousness\r\nof the aspirations of African States to take their place,\r\nwith dignity, in the modern world — a world that is\r\nbeing greatly influenced by globalization.\r\nBelarus is not yet a donor State. We have,\r\nhowever, established a preferential trade regime. We\r\nhope to make a substantial contribution to the revival\r\nof Africa. We are ready to cooperate with interested\r\nAfrican countries in NEPAD in the areas of health care,\r\neducation, agriculture and industry, as well as in\r\nestablishing and modernizing infrastructure. Belarus\r\ncan offer the services of its experts, who have\r\nextensive experience in power engineering, civil and\r\nroad construction, agriculture and health care. Belarus\r\nhas substantial experience with regard to irrigation and\r\ngeological surveys. In this context, Belarus is ready to\r\ndiscuss the modalities of practical involvement in\r\nspecific projects within the framework of NEPAD, as\r\nwell as the ways and means of financing Belarusian\r\nparticipation.\r\nWithin the NEPAD framework, Belarus is\r\nprepared to offer African States a wide range of\r\ntechnologically advanced products. Our industries\r\nproduce reliable and durable goods that are of high\r\nquality and reasonably priced, which could meet the\r\nbasic needs of the African market.\r\nBelarus is ready to expand cooperation in the\r\nfield of science and technology, an area in which my\r\ncountry is working on a number of state-of-the-art,\r\ninnovative research and development projects. We are\r\nready to act under contract with interested\r\norganizations and companies from African countries\r\nwith regard to biotechnology, agricultural technology\r\nand equipment, irrigation, and the reliability and\r\ndurability of machinery, to name just a few. Our\r\nscientific centres and institutions could carry out, on a\r\ncontractual basis, specific research and development in\r\nareas of interest to customers.\r\nWe are interested in cooperation in the field of\r\nhealth, especially on the particularly important\r\nHIV/AIDS-related problems, which have reached\r\n41\r\nA/57/PV.10\r\ncatastrophic proportions in many African nations. We\r\nare ready to set up joint ventures on our national\r\nterritory and in African countries and, working together\r\nwith them, in third countries.\r\nIn the agricultural sector, one area of mutual\r\ninterest could be the introduction of advanced\r\ntechnologies in cattle breeding, poultry farming,\r\nirrigation and agricultural machinery engineering.\r\nWithin the United Nations framework, Belarus, as\r\na founding Member of the Organization, will\r\nconsistently advocate the continuation of unimpeded\r\nUnited Nations efforts aimed at the revival of Africa.\r\nBelarus will continue to assist in the promotion and\r\nadoption of United Nations programmes and projects to\r\naddress economic and humanitarian problems of\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Youssouf Ouédraogo, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Ouédraogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in\r\nFrench): It is a great pleasure for me to take the floor\r\non behalf of Burkina Faso at this high-level plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly devoted to the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). It\r\nshould be remembered that NEPAD was born out of the\r\npolitical will of African leaders to ensure for the new\r\nAfrica a complete democratic renaissance and to set it\r\non course towards the achievement of sustainable\r\ndevelopment for the benefit of African peoples. As a\r\nresult of NEPAD, Africa will be more careful about\r\ngood governance and human rights; it is determined to\r\ntake in hand the reins of its own destiny through the\r\ndefinition and establishment of new forms of\r\nresponsibility and solidarity, within the framework of\r\nits economic relations with the rest of the world. The\r\nPeer Review Mechanism is the best illustration of this.\r\nThe launching of Africa will involve collective,\r\nconcerted and coordinated action. To that end, the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD will require, over and above\r\nthe participation of all the key sectors on the continent,\r\nthe mobilization of external partners. We therefore\r\nwelcome the holding of this plenary meeting, just as\r\nwe should welcome the favourable responses given to\r\nNEPAD in major international forums, in particular\r\nduring the meeting of the Group of Eight and at the\r\nMonterrey Conference and the Johannesburg Summit.\r\nThis plenary meeting is a manifestation of United\r\nNations support for NEPAD. It is thus an appropriate\r\nforum in which to identify new ways of concrete\r\ncooperation, not only with the multilateral system of\r\nthe United Nations, but with our partners from the\r\nNorth and South, where there is still a vast potential for\r\ntrade, investment and multifaceted cooperation that\r\nhave not yet been explored but which are necessary for\r\nthe implementation of NEPAD.\r\nFor its part, Burkina Faso, at a very early stage,\r\nbegan to mobilize around NEPAD, by setting up a\r\nmultidisciplinary and multisectoral unit to study and\r\nfollow up NEPAD. In addition, under the auspices of\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), it recently assisted in the organization of\r\nthe first West African regional forum for private sector\r\nsupport for NEPAD, held from 11 to 13 September\r\n2002 in Ouagadougou. That meeting was attended by\r\nover 400 participants from all the States members of\r\nECOWAS, as well as from certain countries of Central\r\nAfrica and other continents.\r\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm Burkina Faso’s\r\nunswerving commitment to the integrated and\r\nharmonious development of the African continent in an\r\nenvironment of peace, social justice and the equitable\r\nsharing of the fruits of technological development and\r\nworld economic progress.\r\nBurkina Faso appeals to the international\r\ncommunity, the United Nations in particular, to endorse\r\nNEPAD at the global level as the new development\r\nstrategy for Africa that will henceforth provide Africa’s\r\ndevelopment partners with precise guidelines for\r\nhonouring their commitments to the continent.\r\nIn conclusion, I express the wish that this debate\r\nwill produce concrete proposals that will give NEPAD\r\na real chance for success.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.\r\n"
