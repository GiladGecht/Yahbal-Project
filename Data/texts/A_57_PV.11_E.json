(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nItem 41 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nFinal review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s: High-level plenary meeting of\r\nthe General Assembly to consider how to support the\r\nNew Partnership for Africas Development\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/57/156,\r\nA/57/175)\r\nDraft resolution (A/51/L.2/Rev.1)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Carlos Ruckauf,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, External Trade and\r\nWorship of Argentina.\r\nMr. Ruckauf (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): It is\r\nan honour for Argentina and for me to make a\r\nstatement at this important debate to consider the issue\r\nof the New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD). Argentina fully supports this new initiative\r\naimed at eradicating poverty in Africa and helping its\r\npeoples in the path of the rule of law, growth and\r\nsustainable development. My country shares NEPADs\r\nfundamental premise: the link between peace and\r\ndevelopment. In other words, economic and social\r\ndevelopment is not possible without an adequate\r\nframework for peace and stability. The reality in Africa\r\nand other parts of the world shows us daily that, as\r\nlong as the basic needs of the individual remain\r\nunsatisfied and vast inequality persists, the threat of\r\nconflict will always be latent.\r\nFor centuries, the African continent has been part\r\nof the world economy as a supplier of unskilled labour\r\nand raw materials. Colonialism, post-war bipolar\r\nconfrontation, the decolonization process, the end of\r\nthe cold war and globalization brought with them\r\nspecific trends, to which Africa tried to adapt, with a\r\nmajority of the countries failing, regrettably, to achieve\r\nthe expected development results.\r\nHowever, we are not here to blame the past, but\r\nrather to help overcome structural weaknesses that\r\nhave impeded development in Africa. NEPAD\r\nrepresents a new vision and responsible awareness by\r\nAfrican leaders regarding regional and international\r\npolitics and economics. Argentina values the political,\r\neconomic and social objectives that the African leaders\r\nhave pledged to achieve through NEPAD. Among those\r\nobjectives, we wish to underscore conflict prevention,\r\nthe protection of democracy and human rights,\r\neconomic stability, the revitalization of the education\r\nand health sectors, with emphasis on the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other communicable diseases,\r\nthe promotion of the role of women, the development\r\nof infrastructure, agriculture and manufacturing, an\r\nequitable solution to the external debt issue and\r\nintegration of the African continent into international\r\ntrade.\r\nThe NEPAD objectives deserve the support of the\r\ninternational community  the international\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\ncommunity at large, the donor countries, the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO). The United Nations particularly must be the\r\nspokesperson for the least developed, smaller and\r\nweaker countries.\r\nWe live in a world of contradictions. Integration\r\nand globalization coexist with fragmentation and\r\nmarginalization. The unprecedented economic\r\nprosperity achieved in recent years coexists with\r\nextreme poverty in parts of Africa and other areas of\r\nthe world, including Latin America. The only option\r\nfor one fifth of humankind is to survive on $1 per day.\r\nIn spite of that, official development assistance has\r\nsteadily diminished. We believe it must be increased.\r\nWe also believe that the relationship between official\r\ndevelopment assistance and policy implementation is a\r\nkey to achieving sustained economic growth in Africa.\r\nFighting inflation and the fiscal deficit and\r\nencouraging savings and investment are measures that\r\nare directly related to the effectiveness of official\r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nIn our view, support must not be limited to\r\nofficial development assistance; it must also be\r\ntranslated into liberalization of trade that would allow\r\nfor real integration of the African countries into\r\ninternational trade. Tariff barriers are assuming new\r\nforms, such as establishing labour and environmental\r\nstandards and anti-dumping measures, sending a\r\nmessage of little encouragement to African countries\r\nthat are making considerable efforts to modernize their\r\neconomies and conquer export markets. The issue of\r\nthe external debt also deserves a sustainable solution\r\nthat is not detrimental to the allocation of resources to\r\npriority areas of development, such as health and\r\neducation.\r\nIn matters relating to peace and security, we are\r\npleased to note the significant progress achieved in the\r\npeace processes in Angola, Sierra Leone, between\r\nEritrea and Ethiopia and in the Great Lakes region,\r\nwith the active involvement of African regional and\r\nsubregional organizations and the clear, effective and\r\ndecisive involvement of the Security Council through\r\nits resolutions. We think that the relationship between\r\nregional organizations and the Council must be\r\nreinforced and that we should explore the possibilities\r\nfor cooperation set out in Chapter VIII of the Charter.\r\nWe are aware of the efforts being made by the\r\nmajority of African Governments to settle their\r\npending disputes peacefully, strengthen their\r\ndemocratic institutions, promote human rights and\r\nreform their economies. Today we want to renew our\r\ncommitment to Africa. Argentina has always been\r\npresent in Africa. From the beginning, we supported\r\nthe decolonization process and the fight against\r\napartheid.\r\nConsistent with an approach that links peace and\r\nsecurity, Argentina has contributed to peacekeeping,\r\nhumanitarian assistance, good governance and\r\ntechnical cooperation for development.\r\nIn the 1960s, Argentina participated in the\r\npeacekeeping operation in Congo. Subsequently we\r\nhave been present in Angola, Mozambique and in the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Eritrea and Ethiopia. At\r\npresent, Argentina is participating in the United\r\nNations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara\r\nand in the United Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. With electoral\r\nobservers, Argentina participated in the first free and\r\nfair elections held in South Africa, in the referendum\r\nfor self-determination in Eritrea and in the 1997\r\nlegislative elections in Algeria.\r\nArgentina provides humanitarian assistance either\r\ndirectly or through the White Helmets initiative and\r\npromotes development cooperation through a\r\nprogramme of cooperation funds. Likewise, with the\r\nZone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic,\r\nwhich brings together three Latin American and 21\r\nAfrican countries, an action coordinated by my country\r\nsince 1998, Argentina has presented several proposals\r\nto deepen cooperation among members of the Zone.\r\nIn recent years, Argentina has strengthened its\r\npolitical, cultural and commercial ties with Africa. We\r\nwant this mutually beneficial trend towards dialogue\r\nand cooperation to continue and further deepen in the\r\nfuture.\r\nI would not wish to conclude my intervention\r\nwithout expressing the gratitude of the Argentine\r\nRepublic towards Africa. Virtually no changes could\r\nhave been possible in this Organization in areas of\r\nparamount importance such as decolonization,\r\ndisarmament, the law of the sea, human rights and\r\ndevelopment, just to name a few, without the\r\nsubstantial contributions and clear commitments made\r\nby Africa to the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I would like to remind all representatives\r\nabout the agreed five-minute time limit on statements. I\r\nappeal to all speakers to really, genuinely respect it.\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Abdurrahman Mohamed Shalghem, Secretary of\r\nthe General Peoples Committee for Foreign Liaison\r\nand International Cooperation of the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya.\r\nMr. Shalghem (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke\r\nin Arabic): I am pleased to express my deep\r\nappreciation to you, Sir, for presiding over this very\r\nimportant meeting. I would also like to express our\r\nthanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his keen\r\ninterest in African causes and his continuous efforts for\r\nthe establishment and consolidation of peace in the\r\ncontinent and for African development in all fields.\r\nAfrican leaders have reaffirmed their determined\r\nwill and full commitment to guarantee complete\r\nsuccess in the implementation of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development (NEPAD), and have stated\r\nthe need to take all genuine and effective measures to\r\ntransform the Partnership into reality, especially\r\nbecause it is African-led and should respond to all of\r\nAfricas aspirations to comprehensive development.\r\nThis meeting, which is devoted to considering\r\nhow to support NEPAD, is a clear indication of the\r\ninternational communitys desire to respond to Africas\r\nspecial needs. Those needs have been underlined in\r\nseveral international forums and, particularly, in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nAfrica fully realizes that the main responsibility\r\nfor the implementation of NEPAD falls on the\r\nshoulders of the African peoples. However,\r\ninternational support is essential. That is why we urge\r\nthe agencies of the United Nations system and the\r\ninternational community to help in achieving NEPADs\r\nobjectives through practical and concrete measures: by\r\nmobilizing financial resources, by increasing official\r\ndevelopment assistance and direct investment, by\r\neasing the debt burden and by embarking on new\r\ninitiatives to improve the access of African exports to\r\nworld markets, especially those of developed countries.\r\nThere is also a need for assistance in the fields of\r\nhuman resources and capacity-building through\r\ninvestment in health, education, drinking water and the\r\ninfrastructure projects needed to achieve economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn order for NEPAD to be a true and truly new\r\npartnership, the partners should observe the following\r\npoints. First, they must respect the will, history and\r\nculture of the Africans, with all that this entails: the\r\nexclusion of any political conditions or biased\r\npositions that would ignore the specificity and innate\r\ncharacter of a society. Development should be\r\nrecognized as a historical process that cannot be\r\nachieved through political decisions.\r\nSecondly, donors should realize that the extent to\r\nwhich they contribute to the financing of NEPAD is the\r\nextent to which their own societies will benefit both\r\nmaterially and socially. Limiting or preventing\r\nimmigration through legislative and administrative\r\nmeasures will not achieve the desired effect. The\r\nexpansion of development projects in countries whose\r\npeople are emigrating could keep people in their\r\nhomeland and drastically and definitively remove\r\nincentives to emigrate.\r\nThirdly, priority should be given to infrastructure\r\nprojects, especially in the fields of communications and\r\nroad-building. This could help all sectors to achieve\r\ndevelopment, production and stability at lower cost.\r\nFourthly, special importance should be attached\r\nto water projects in order to make maximal and optimal\r\nuse of all water sources in Africa for diverse purposes,\r\nespecially agricultural, in order to solve food problems\r\nand eradicate poverty throughout the continent.\r\nFifthly, all restrictions on the transfer and\r\ndissemination of technology should be eliminated; this\r\nwould further development in various economic and\r\nsocial fields.\r\nSixthly, consideration should be given to Africas\r\nlong suffering over past centuries, to the fact that its\r\nresources were plundered without compensation and to\r\nthe role played by those resources in the development\r\nthat certain countries have attained.\r\nFinally, it is essential to deal with one of the most\r\nimportant phenomena in Africa, the brain drain, which\r\naffects its finest human resources, who emigrate to\r\ndeveloped countries due to the pressure of several\r\ninterconnected causes. The creation of a suitable\r\nenvironment for African minds and expertise plays a\r\nrole in the countries that have prepared and educated\r\nsuch minds. This would greatly benefit the Partnership\r\nand save everyone huge costs in terms of the loss of\r\ntalent.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Inam ul Haque, Minister\r\nof State for Foreign Affairs of Pakistan.\r\nMr. Haque (Pakistan): My delegation would like\r\nto begin by commending the African leadership for\r\ntheir vision of launching Africa on the path of\r\nsustainable growth and development through the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD). We\r\nare happy that this Africa-led, Africa-owned and\r\nAfrica-driven programme is an integrated and\r\ncomprehensive framework for Africas development.\r\nDuring the past decade, many initiatives were\r\nevolved and launched. Yet the overall situation on the\r\nAfrican continent has not improved over the last two\r\ndecades. Some 80 million more people live in poverty\r\nin Africa today than did at the dawn of the decade of\r\nthe 1990s.\r\nCognizant of these realities, most African\r\nGovernments have undertaken important structural\r\nreforms, reflected in improved macroeconomic\r\nmanagement, trade liberalization and the\r\nencouragement of greater and enhanced private sector\r\nparticipation. However, overall, the results have not\r\nreversed the economic decline in Africa. NEPAD offers\r\nhope. It sets out a broad vision for Africas future,\r\noutlines a strategy for achieving that vision and spells\r\nout a programme of action focused on a number of key\r\npriority areas.\r\nMany elements of New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment, such as peace and security, poverty\r\nalleviation, socio-economic development, good\r\ngovernance and infra-structural development directly\r\ncorrespond to ongoing programmes of the United\r\nNations in African countries. The United Nations can,\r\nand must, play a tangible supporting role in this\r\nimportant project.\r\nThe primary objective of NEPAD is to eventually\r\neradicate poverty in Africa and place African countries\r\non the path of sustainable growth and development,\r\nthus reversing the marginalization of Africa and\r\nintegrating it into the globalization process. This is a\r\ngigantic and formidable challenge that Africa cannot\r\novercome on its own. It needs meaningful international\r\nsupport and assistance, which will entail action at two\r\nlevels.\r\nFirst, the international community should help in\r\ndealing with the underlying political and security\r\ncauses of instability in the African continent. At the\r\nsame time, the economic and social problems afflicting\r\nparts of Africa must be tackled through a\r\ncomprehensive assistance programme comprised of\r\nadequate resources. Such a programme should be\r\ncomplemented by: improved market access for African\r\nexports; accelerated and increased debt relief,\r\nincluding complete debt cancellation; enhanced\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) without\r\nconditionalities; conscious efforts to increase the flow\r\nof foreign direct investment to African countries;\r\ntransfer of technology to African countries on\r\nconcessional and preferential terms; human resource\r\ndevelopment, particularly in health and education; and\r\na special and focussed endeavour to halt and eradicate\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nPakistan, for its part, has consistently supported\r\nthe political and economic aspirations of Africa. We\r\nare proud of our participation in several United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in that Continent. Our military\r\nand civilian personnel have been part of United\r\nNations operations in Somalia, Namibia, Liberia,\r\nWestern Sahara, and, lately, Sierra Leone. Pakistan will\r\ncontinue to lend its moral and material support to\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nOur technical assistance programme for Africa is\r\nan on-going process of training young professionals in\r\ndiverse fields. Today, I would like to affirm that\r\nPakistan will extend full support to NEPAD in all\r\npossible ways.\r\nAfrican people have suffered for a long time.\r\nChallenges faced by Africa are colossal. NEPAD\r\nrepresents a realistic framework to meet these\r\nchallenges. Commitments are there, so are the plans. It\r\nis time to turn words into deeds. This is our moral\r\nobligation as well as a political imperative.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Joseph Deiss, Federal\r\nCounsellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nSwitzerland.\r\nMr. Deiss (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I am\r\nparticularly pleased that it is on the subject of Africa\r\nthat Switzerland is participating for the first time as a\r\nMember State in a substantive debate in this Assembly.\r\nA long-standing partner of the African continent,\r\nSwitzerland welcomes this initiative designed by\r\nAfricans for Africa, through which the African\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\ncountries are expressing their determination to control\r\nthe destiny of their continent. I wish, here, to\r\ncongratulate our African colleagues on this new shared\r\napproach to the economic and social development of\r\ntheir continent and on the very ambitious and\r\ndemanding strategy their countries have set up for\r\nthemselves.\r\nThe massive support being given to this new\r\npartnership by the African States constitutes its greatest\r\nstrength and the best evidence of its potential for\r\nsuccess. The priority areas identified by NEPAD, in\r\nparticular the development of human resources, will\r\nmake it possible to act on the key factors of sustainable\r\neconomic and social development on the continent.\r\nI am also delighted that NEPAD places the\r\nprinciple of partnership at the heart of its efforts. As we\r\nalready considered, the establishment of genuine\r\npartnerships among all parties concerned was an\r\nindispensable condition for the success of development\r\ncooperation.\r\nWe believe that the improvement of surrounding\r\nconditions will play the most critical role in allowing\r\noptimal action by all development players and in\r\nparticular the private sector, to which NEPAD,\r\ncorrectly, attributes the fundamental role as the driving\r\nforce of economic development.\r\nIt is therefore our hope that concrete steps can\r\nsoon be taken in the areas of good management of\r\npublic and private affairs, democracy and peace and\r\nsecurity. In this regard, the rapid and systematic\r\nimplementation of the Declaration on Democracy,\r\nPolitical, Economic and Corporate Governance seems\r\nto us to be an indispensable factor in increasing the\r\nconfidence of all partners, including private investors,\r\nboth African and those from outside the continent.\r\nThe implementation of an effective and credible\r\nreview mechanism by peer countries, a major\r\ninnovation promised by NEPAD, seems to us, therefore\r\nto be crucial.\r\nSwitzerland strongly encourages the clearly\r\naffirmed will of NEPAD to strengthen the role of\r\nAfrican civil society in the design, planning and\r\nimplementation of programmes.\r\nThe assistance that Switzerland has been giving\r\nto Africa for a long time is granted not only in a spirit\r\nof solidarity with the neediest populations, but also\r\nwith the objective of intensifying, over time, our\r\neconomic and commercial partnership. The\r\nprogrammes we support on the continent focus on the\r\nfight against poverty and support national strategies to\r\ncombat poverty. Our programmes include action in the\r\nfields of health, education and training. We also focus\r\non good governance in the public sector,\r\ndecentralization and reforms in justice, as well as on\r\nthe promotion of economy and investment, in\r\nparticular, through measures for budgetary assistance.\r\nLastly, we attach growing importance to measures\r\nfor peacekeeping and human rights. Moreover, we have\r\nalways been strongly on the side of Africa in\r\nmultilateral institutions. Switzerland has long been\r\nactively in favour of reducing the indebtedness of the\r\nleast developed countries in the framework of the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\r\nToward that end, we have entered into many financial\r\nassistance programmes and debt reduction programmes\r\nwith our African partners.\r\nWe are determined to support NEPAD fully,\r\nwithin our means, and in particular with our\r\nlongstanding partner countries. Coordination among\r\npartners is one of the fundamental concepts of NEPAD.\r\nI can assure you that Switzerland will participate fully.\r\nNonetheless, a little more than a year before the launch\r\nof the initiative, we believe that the New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development (NEPAD) still needs to\r\nclarify its role with regard to the existing African\r\ninstitutions and to multilateral and bilateral partners,\r\nboth internationally and at the subregional and country\r\nlevels. In this regard, it seems essential to us that\r\nNEPAD avoid becoming an implementing structure,\r\nand that it be able to focus on its role as an advocate\r\nand a promoter.\r\nFurthermore, we will continue to use our\r\nexperience and our expertise in our traditional areas of\r\nintervention, in order to support NEPAD priorities. On\r\nthe basis of our official development assistance (ODA)\r\nbudget, we are prepared to envisage an increase in that\r\nsupport. Lastly, Switzerland will continue its resolute\r\ncommitment, in the United Nations and international\r\nfinancial institutions, to programmes of cooperation\r\nand increased investment in Africa, in line with\r\nNEPAD priorities. We will also continue to work for\r\nthe fair treatment of the poorest countries in\r\ninternational trade negotiations.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Koffi Panou, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Togo.\r\nMr. Panou (Togo) (spoke in French): On behalf\r\nof the Togolese delegation, I would like to thank you,\r\nMr. President, for giving me this opportunity to speak\r\nin this debate concerning the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development, NEPAD. There is no need to\r\nmention how important and timely this debate is, given\r\nthe great importance that Africa attaches to this new\r\ninitiative and the role that the international community\r\nis called upon to play in its implementation.\r\nAccording to the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Africa, our continent had a growth rate\r\nof 4.3% in 2001, as compared to 3.5% in 2000. That is\r\na good performance, one is tempted to say, but in fact\r\nwe must acknowledge that the economic situation in\r\nAfrica is still very precarious and disturbing. It\r\nrequires strong action by the international community,\r\nand above all by the Africans themselves, especially if\r\nwe want to achieve the priority development goals set\r\nforth in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nNEPAD today is Africas reply to the challenge of\r\neconomic and social development in the continent.\r\nAfrica is gradually getting organized and is assuming\r\nits own destiny with conviction, and welcomes the\r\nreception given NEPAD by development partners,\r\nprimarily the United Nations, donor countries and\r\ninternational financial institutions. Africa welcomes the\r\ncommitments already made at the summit meetings in\r\nGenoa, Monterrey, Kananaski and Johannesburg.\r\nOur countries, by making the necessary efforts,\r\nstrongly wish that the promises made at those meetings\r\nto help Africa attain NEPAD goals will be respected\r\nwithin the given deadlines. We are counting on the\r\nsupport of the United Nations and the entire\r\ninternational community. It is my hope that, following\r\nthis debate, we will together undertake specific\r\nactivities that answer the expectations of our peoples\r\nand their hopes for well-being and progress, so that one\r\nday we can say that NEPAD was not just another\r\nprogramme, but a project that delivered for Africa. It is\r\nhigh time for us to move from words to deeds.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Her Excellency The Honourable Lilian\r\nPatel, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International\r\nCooperation of the Republic of Malawi.\r\nMrs. Patel (Malawi) (spoke in English): Allow\r\nme to join the other African delegations in thanking the\r\nUnited Nations for arranging this special high-level\r\nsession as a platform to introduce the New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development (NEPAD). NEPAD is the\r\nflagship of the African Union, designed to create\r\nconditions for economic recovery and sustainable\r\ndevelopment on the continent, within the context of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration and the\r\nMillennium development goals. It is first and foremost\r\na partnership among the African countries themselves,\r\nand secondly a partnership between Africa and the\r\ninternational community, based on shared\r\nresponsibility and mutual respect.\r\nThrough NEPAD, Africa wishes to demonstrate\r\nits determination to break with a long past,\r\ncharacterized by strategic missteps on the part of our\r\nleadership that resulted in immeasurable waste of the\r\ncontinents precious resources and in a lamentable loss\r\nof opportunities for progress on the continent.\r\nThe NEPAD initiative would not have come at a\r\nbetter time than now, when Africa is plagued by\r\ndeepening poverty, the debt burden, the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, in addition to armed conflicts, famine, and\r\nother human crises. If only these problems could be\r\novercome, Africa would be integrated into the world\r\neconomy and have a role in the process of\r\nglobalization. This would be not only for Africas own\r\nbenefit, but also for the benefit of all mankind.\r\nAs an African-owned and African-made\r\ndevelopment strategy, premised on collective self-\r\nreliance, NEPAD seeks to unlock the development\r\npotential of the continents vast natural resources.\r\nHowever, this ought to be complemented by external\r\ncapital inflows in the form of official development aid\r\n(ODA), trade and investment. In this respect, I would\r\nlike to thank the Group of Eight (G-8) countries for\r\nleading the way in supporting NEPAD through the\r\ncreation of the G-8 Africa Action Plan. This will serve\r\nas a rallying point for the initiative.\r\nI would like to emphasize that increased ODA\r\nalone will not ensure the success of NEPAD. It is\r\ncritical that the international community should also\r\ndeliver on long-standing commitments on debt-relief,\r\nmarket access for African exports, and foreign direct\r\ninvestment.\r\nFor our part, we African Governments will ensure\r\nthat good political and economic governance becomes\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nthe norm through the determined promotion of pluralist\r\ndemocracy, accountability and transparency, and\r\nrespect for the rule of law and human rights. Actually,\r\nAfrica is already on an irreversible course of\r\ndemocratization. There may be problems here and\r\nthere, but this should not be the basis for judging the\r\nwhole continent. Naturally, different countries move at\r\na different pace. What is necessary is the support of all,\r\nincluding our external partners, to overcome the\r\nproblems. After all, NEPAD is intended to resolve such\r\nproblems and to ensure the development of the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to call upon the\r\nUnited Nations, and the world international\r\ncommunity, to work in partnership with Africa to\r\nensure the success of NEPAD.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Celso Lafer, Minister\r\nfor External Relations of Brazil.\r\nMr. Lafer (Brazil): It is a great honour for me\r\nto represent Brazil at this high-level meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly dedicated to fostering African\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe ties joining Brazil and Africa run deep. The\r\ncontours of Brazilian culture and civilization owe much\r\nto their historical nexus with the African peoples.\r\nBrazils support for the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) highlights this awareness of\r\nour inextricable connections to Africa.\r\nWe have taken a keen interest in the African\r\ncontinent and have been engaged in many recent\r\ndevelopments there. We are convinced that a new era is\r\nbeing ushered in, one that offers renewed expectations\r\nfor peace, democracy and prosperity. NEPAD is one of\r\nthe reasons for optimism, for it embodies the\r\nrecognition that Africa itself holds the key to its own\r\ndevelopment. It is an African-born initiative based on a\r\nprofound understanding of the daily realities of the\r\ncontinent. Moreover, it contains mutually reinforcing\r\naspects that allow for the creation of a virtuous circle\r\nof socio-political inclusion, development and peace.\r\nNEPAD also offers new opportunities with regard to\r\ndevelopment assistance. Resources to support NEPAD\r\ncould be usefully channelled through multilateral\r\ninstitutions to foster triangular, as well as South-South,\r\ncooperation.\r\nSince 1996, Brazil has adopted a debt alleviation\r\npolicy with regard to African countries that contributes\r\nto the success of initiatives such as NEPAD. In recent\r\nyears, we have written off more than $1 billion in debts\r\nin the hope of fostering, within our possibilities,\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nNEPAD is not an isolated proposal: it forms part\r\nof a wider effort for regional renewal enshrined in the\r\nestablishment of the African Union. The first signs of\r\nthese new times are already visible in the strengthening\r\nof democracy and the peaceful settlement of regional\r\nconflicts. Such is the case, for example, of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Ethiopia\r\nand Eritrea, and Angola. Those developments\r\nunderscore the affinity between the new African\r\ninitiatives and the core principles of the United\r\nNations. NEPAD and the African Union are significant\r\nsteps on the road to making the African renaissance a\r\nreality.\r\nBrazil shares many of the concerns of African\r\ncountries. The zone of peace and cooperation of the\r\nSouth Atlantic and the Community of Portuguese-\r\nspeaking Countries bring us together. Those forums\r\noffer further opportunities for coordination and\r\ncooperation on issues such as environmental\r\nprotection, cultural exchange, trade liberalization and\r\nthe fighting of the illicit traffic in small arms. The\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries, created\r\nin the 1990s, provides a powerful tool for political\r\naction and cooperation in realizing the common\r\naspirations of our peoples.\r\nBeyond the cultural and linguistic links, we are\r\nunited in the struggle to overcome shared problems and\r\nin the struggle for a more equitable international order.\r\nThe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries is\r\nfundamentally committed to the primacy of peace, as\r\nenshrined in the Brasilia Declaration, adopted last\r\nAugust.\r\nBrazil has sponsored other initiatives aimed at\r\nfostering cooperation and understanding between the\r\ntwo shores of the South Atlantic Ocean. In May and\r\nJune of 2003, in Brasilia, we will host a wide-ranging\r\nBrazil-Africa seminar that will aim to put into\r\nperspective the array of ties that unite us on our\r\ncommon path to development.\r\nBrazilian cooperation with Africa encompasses\r\nmany areas from agriculture to infrastructure, from\r\ntrade to public administration. The main thrust of these\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nprojects is to develop human resources and to\r\nstrengthen capacity-building. Let me highlight two\r\nessential areas: education and health.\r\nBrazil is sharing with African countries its\r\nexperiences in the field of education, such as the Bolsa\r\nEscola programme, a scholarship for poor families,\r\naimed at increasing their income and keeping children\r\nin school. The initiative has proved to be a useful tool\r\nin promoting basic education, decreasing dropout rates\r\nand promoting income redistribution and poverty\r\nreduction. Brazil has already started a cooperation\r\nproject with Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe\r\naimed at establishing a Bolsa Escola programme in\r\nthose countries.\r\nAnother area where Brazil and African countries\r\nhave joined efforts is that of the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. We do not need to dwell on the devastating\r\nimpact of the epidemic. Based on an integrated\r\napproach of prevention, treatment and human rights\r\npolicies, Brazil has halted the spread of the epidemic\r\nand has enabled people with HIV or AIDS to live\r\nnormal and dignified lives.\r\nBrazil has already initiated cooperation projects\r\nwith African countries, in particular the Portuguese-\r\nspeaking ones. Those projects are focused on capacity-\r\nbuilding, human resources development and\r\ntechnology transfer. We also believe that the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is an\r\nessential tool in providing assistance to African\r\nnations. Brazil has already actively participated in the\r\nFund and has stated its readiness to contribute to it\r\nthrough technical assistance.\r\nTo conclude, in working to overcome common\r\nchallenges, our partnership takes its cue from the\r\nvitality of our peoples, the creativity and determination\r\nof our leaders and the growing role of civil society.\r\nThat partnership gives form to a mutually supportive\r\nrelationship between a country and a continent which\r\nshare the ideals of democracy, peace and development\r\nand which have found in NEPAD a new source of\r\ninspiration. NEPAD means African leadership and\r\nAfrican ownership. That is an idea Brazil wishes to\r\ncommend and support.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Vilayat Mukhtar ogly\r\nGuliyev, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Guliyev (Azerbaijan): I am pleased to\r\naddress, on behalf of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the\r\nhigh-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly to\r\nconsider how to support the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD).\r\nI should also like to express our heartfelt\r\ncongratulations to the countries of Africa on the\r\noccasion of the establishment of the African Union. We\r\nare certain that it will be a solid foundation for\r\nachieving greater unity and solidarity among the\r\ncountries and the peoples of Africa, while accelerating\r\nthe political and socio-economic integration of their\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe warmly welcome and support NEPAD, a truly\r\nAfrican initiative that should lead African nations to\r\nthe progress, prosperity and development of the entire\r\nAfrican continent. We expect a more active and more\r\nvisible role for NEPAD in advancing the interests of\r\nAfrican nations in the international arena. It is within\r\nthe power and the capability of African States to jointly\r\npromote and defend the cause of Africa and to speak up\r\nfor those who have been abused or oppressed. The fact\r\nthat some 30 per cent of all refugee populations\r\nforcefully displaced as a result of conflicts and tensions\r\nthroughout the world are Africans dictates as a\r\nnecessary goal the strengthening of relevant NEPAD\r\nfunctions. Always speaking with one voice and\r\ntranslating declared unity into practical work will allow\r\nAfrican values to be upheld successfully and with\r\ndignity. As has been stressed by the majority of\r\ndelegations, the unresolved conflicts on the African\r\ncontinent remain serious obstacles to establishing\r\ndurable peace and security, stability and prosperity in\r\nAfrica.\r\nAs a reflection of Azerbaijans long-term\r\ncontribution to Africas development, I am proud to\r\nstate that, since 1960, my country has been actively\r\nengaged in educating young men and women from\r\nvarious parts of the African continent. Approximately\r\n10,000 young people from 25 African countries, among\r\nthem eminent statesmen and leaders, have had the\r\nopportunity to receive their higher education in\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nI should like to reaffirm our commitment to\r\nsupporting African development activities in the spirit\r\nof true partnership and mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation. We are certain that, with concerted efforts\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nby the international community, NEPAD will be a real\r\nsuccess for Africa.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by The Honourable Mr. Tom Butime, Minister\r\nof State for Foreign Affairs of Uganda.\r\nMr. Butime (Uganda): There is no doubt that the\r\nAfrican countries will take responsibility for the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). In order to achieve the\r\nobjective of eradicating poverty and other targets\r\nidentified in the millennium development goals,\r\nhowever, NEPAD recognizes the need for key,\r\nmutually supportive, strategic partnerships. These\r\ninclude partnerships between African countries at the\r\nsubregional and regional levels; partnerships between\r\nAfrican Governments and the private sector, which\r\nwere launched at the Conference on the Financing of\r\nNEPAD, held at Dakar in April; and partnerships\r\nbetween Africa and the international community,\r\nincluding the United Nations and donor countries, and\r\nwithin the framework of South-South cooperation.\r\nUganda is committed to the implementation of\r\nNEPAD, like many other African countries; it is also\r\ncommitted to constitutionalism, democracy and good\r\ngovernance. Uganda has established a national focal\r\npoint for NEPAD, and it is envisaged that the national\r\nsteering committee will involve the private sector and\r\ncivil society. We feel that it is in Africas own interest\r\nto build strong democratic institutions and to ensure\r\nthe establishment of peace and security as prerequisites\r\nfor development.\r\nBut how can the international community assist\r\nAfrica in the implementation of NEPAD? That is a\r\nquestion on which I should like to concentrate. Since\r\nthis morning, much has been said about the need for\r\ngreater enhancement of the partnership between Africa\r\nand the international community, especially the donor\r\ncountries. Uganda appreciates the effort led by Canada\r\nto support NEPAD, reflected in the Group of Eight (G-\r\n8) Africa Action Plan of June 2002. Initiatives such as\r\nthe European Unions everything but arms initiative,\r\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United\r\nStates and The Canada Helps Build New Partnerships\r\nwith Africa programme are a significant step forward.\r\nEqually useful are the proposals by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on future United Nations engagement with\r\nNEPAD.\r\nIn order to adequately support the implementation\r\nof NEPAD, Uganda calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to take concrete and deliberate measures to\r\nimplement the G-8 Africa Action Plan, including:\r\nallocating at least $6 billion per annum in new and\r\nuntied bilateral resources for NEPAD programmes in\r\nAfrica; meeting the objective of duty-free, quota-free\r\nmarket access for Africas processed and semi-\r\nprocessed products as well as eliminating agricultural\r\nsubsidies in the developed countries; increasing\r\nresources committed to the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Debt Initiative to ensure debt\r\nsustainability based on realistic export earnings of\r\nAfrican countries; enhancing Africas capacity to\r\nattract public- and private-sector investment from\r\nwithin and outside Africa for the development of\r\nhuman capacity, institutions, infrastructure  railways,\r\nroads and ports  and cheap and renewable energy\r\nsources, including hydroelectric power; facilitating the\r\nfinancing of private investment through the increased\r\nuse of development finance institutions, export credits\r\nand risk guarantee agencies; supporting Africas\r\ninitiative to ensure efficient regional financial markets\r\nand domestic savings and financing mechanisms,\r\nincluding microcredit schemes; and supporting efforts\r\naimed at higher agricultural productivity in Africa,\r\nincluding agricultural research institutions, sustainable\r\nland management, reliable central water systems, rural\r\ndevelopment and the integration of food security into\r\npoverty eradication strategies.\r\nFinally, I hope that, when the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nof the Whole meets on NEPAD in October, the General\r\nAssembly will agree on an action plan to ensure an\r\nintegrated United Nations response to NEPAD through\r\nimproved coordination and collaboration among its\r\nvarious bodies and agencies; coherence among the\r\nUnited Nations system, multilateral monetary and\r\nfinancial institutions and the World Trade Organization\r\nin support of NEPAD; and identification of selected\r\nindicators and targets, in consultation with the NEPAD\r\nSteering Committee and the African Union, to monitor\r\nthe United Nations response to NEPAD.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency The Honourable Keliopate\r\nTavola, Minister for Foreign Affairs and External\r\nTrade of the Republic of the Fiji Islands.\r\nMr. Tavola (Fiji): The final review and appraisal\r\nof the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) is\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nfostering the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). NEPAD is a home-grown\r\nAfrican initiative that is taking off with new\r\nmomentum in terms of ideological and strategic\r\nrethinking on development.\r\nWe are confident in the knowledge that long-term\r\nsustainable development solutions for Africa can be\r\nreplicated in other developing countries. It is therefore\r\nmy great pleasure, as a developing country in the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group, to\r\ncontribute to this debate on the final review of the\r\nUnited Nations Agenda. Fiji, as the Groups current\r\nPresident, warmly embraced the concept of NEPAD at\r\nthe Groups last meeting, which my Government\r\nhosted last July. The Nadi Declaration, which was\r\nadopted at that meeting, was issued as document\r\nA/55/1015.\r\nThree decades ago the developing countries of the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific regions formed the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group, of which the\r\nAfrican continent forms an integral part. Our common\r\nvision was born out of the constituents shared\r\naspirations for socio-economic advancement, in\r\npartnership with the European Union. Market access\r\nwas the usual substantive object of the trade\r\nagreements between the ACP and the European Union.\r\nThe current preferential arrangement under the\r\nCotonou Agreement continues this form of\r\ndevelopment assistance to the three regions in the\r\nGroup until the end of 2007, when a new trade\r\narrangement will need to be put in place.\r\nThe evolving global economic landscape has long\r\nchallenged the ACP vision, today more than ever as our\r\nmembers find themselves immersed in and surrounded\r\nby the forces of globalization. NEPAD offers Africa a\r\nnew opportunity to respond to these challenges. For\r\nNEPAD to deliver on the carefully targeted set of\r\nactions, its policy framework and aspirations have to\r\nbe liberating and self-sustaining. Africa must control\r\nand feed its own development and growth mechanisms.\r\nIndeed, this presupposes several levels of shifts\r\nand stances. Internal investment bases and saving\r\nmechanisms need to grow to be able to sustain\r\ndomestic development programmes. Fundamental\r\ninfrastructure is critical to long-term development and\r\ngrowth. Africa needs its dams, bridges, roads, schools,\r\nhospitals and communication facilities. Today Africas\r\nfuture can leapfrog with information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICT). While aid and\r\nofficial development assistance has its proper place, it\r\nhas also entrenched the dependency mindset and so\r\nstifled growth. No country can be built on aid, debt or\r\ncredit alone. While these resources are essential for\r\ndevelopment, we need new possibilities.\r\nWe have learned many lessons on development in\r\nAfrica. The ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nthreaten to roll back development gains in the\r\ncontinent. Notably, however, peace and security are\r\ngaining ground, while political stability increasingly is\r\ntaking hold in the continent, with its new and emerging\r\ndemocracies. For its part, the international community\r\nhas set up new mechanisms to help shape our options\r\nin this new partnership for the immediate future. The\r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg action plan\r\nare pillars for, and are in place to help us deliver, the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. NEPAD can be built\r\nand strengthened on this foundation. It is incumbent on\r\nthe United Nations to reorientate its modalities for\r\npartnership engagement with the African continent. In\r\ndoing so, the United Nations must support the African\r\nownership and leadership of NEPAD.\r\nOnce NEPAD is firmly rooted, Africa can\r\nfavourably match its national and regional initiatives\r\nwith external assistance. The avenues for such\r\nassistance would need to be transparent and solicited\r\nexternally with the purposes of building democratic\r\ngovernance and sound political bases from the\r\nperspective of the African countries themselves. For\r\ntoo long, developing countries, including those on the\r\nAfrican continent, have been shackled by the hands\r\nthat feed them.\r\nNEPAD cannot be built in a day. In future, we can\r\nlook forward to a robust Africa, free of conflicts; an\r\nend to corruption and political instability; and a\r\nreduction in poverty in keeping with the development\r\nlevels set by the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Hassan Wirayuda,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nIndonesia.\r\nMr. Wirayuda (Indonesia): Speaking as a person\r\nfrom Asia, let me say that this meeting reminds me of\r\nthe Asia-Africa Conference held in Bandung in\r\n1955  a conference that, almost half a century ago,\r\ngave rise to the spirit of Bandung, advocating the\r\nprinciples of solidarity for the promotion of political\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nfreedom and economic cooperation for development. It\r\ncan still be relevant today in helping to inspire\r\ncooperation and solidarity among the peoples of our\r\ntwo continents.\r\nLet me therefore welcome the establishment of\r\nthe African Union and the launching of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD), a\r\nholistic, integrated sustainable development initiative\r\nfor the revival of economic and social development in\r\nAfrica. NEPAD represents a call for a new relationship\r\nof partnership between Africa and the international\r\ncommunity, including multilateral organizations, on the\r\nbasis of mutual interest, benefit and equality, to\r\npromote sustainable development and eradicate\r\nwrenching poverty.\r\nTaken together, NEPAD and the African Union\r\nshould help to advance regional cooperation in Africa\r\nand should help Africa to speak for itself with a strong,\r\ncoherent and single voice. These initiatives will\r\nprovide greater opportunities for the continent to better\r\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century and\r\nenhance its capacity to achieve the sustainable\r\ndevelopment goals set out in the implementation\r\ndocument of the Johannesburg Summit. Moreover, they\r\noffer the possibility of the promotion of regional peace\r\nand security on the continent, which are prerequisites\r\nfor development.\r\nThe establishment of good governance and\r\nregional peace and security is part and parcel of the\r\neffective implementation of the New Partnership. We\r\nare pleased to note that the initiative is premised on\r\nAfrican States making commitments to good\r\ngovernance, democracy and human rights. These are\r\ncritical prerequisites for moving development forward\r\nthat are largely within the control of respective national\r\nGovernments.\r\nThere are other issues, particularly those of\r\nfinance and market access, that require cooperation\r\nbetween the international community and multilateral\r\norganizations. Regrettably, such cooperation, despite\r\nmajor initiatives and promises, has been gravely eroded\r\nover the past decade.\r\nThe gap between international commitments and\r\nresults is particularly glaring in the case of Africa.\r\nIndeed, official development assistance decreased 43\r\nper cent in Africa over the decade-long lifespan of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nMoreover, crushing external debt levels have\r\nfurther undermined financing for development through\r\nthe diversion of development resources. This adverse\r\nsituation is most pronounced in the least developed\r\ncountries. Despite pledges of debt relief, especially\r\nthrough the extended Debt Initiative for the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC)  most of which are\r\nin Africa  little or nothing significant has been\r\nachieved. In fact, only a few countries had reached\r\ncompletion point as of April 2002.\r\nThe international trading system, which holds out\r\ngreat hope for development, has largely failed the\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa. Trade\r\nopportunities under the UN-NADAF mechanism\r\nexpanded far more slowly than expected. One of the\r\npersistent underlying constraints responsible for the\r\nweak performance of African economies is their heavy\r\nreliance on primary commodities. This is largely due to\r\nthe deterioration in the terms of trade for commodities\r\nvis-à-vis industrial goods and to the punitive tariff\r\nbarriers confronting processed and value-added\r\nproducts from Africa.\r\nThose were lessons well learned from the\r\nimplementation of the New Agenda. Thus, as is fully\r\nrecognized by African Governments, there is an acute\r\nneed for diversification, as commodities alone hold few\r\nprospects for the future. Greater efforts towards\r\ndiversifying exports under the framework of the New\r\nPartnership are therefore a critical way forward. But\r\ndiversification alone will not suffice. What is also\r\ncritical is a conducive external environment,\r\nparticularly one that provides ample access to markets.\r\nThis has certainly not been promoted by agricultural\r\nsubsidies in rich nations, which have not only shut out\r\nproducers from developing countries but have also\r\ndepressed prices.\r\nProposals on the modalities of future United\r\nNations engagement with the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development are outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGenerals report. We welcome these relationships,\r\nwhich will take place at the country, regional and\r\nglobal levels, and we hope that they will be further\r\nstrengthened. Pledges have been made at high-level\r\nmeetings to reverse the declining trend in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, to open up the markets of\r\ndeveloped countries to developing countries export\r\nproducts and to reorient the worlds financial and trade\r\nsystems towards promoting sustainable development\r\nand addressing the development needs of developing\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\ncountries. But all these pledges have been made before.\r\nNow we must have action.\r\nTo support the implementation of NEPAD we\r\nmust strengthen international cooperation and\r\nmultilateralism. As a unique reservoir of\r\nmultilateralism, the United Nations is well positioned\r\nas a coordinator of the follow-up to major United\r\nNations conferences and as a supporter of NEPAD and\r\nthe development of Africa. It is our hope that we can\r\ntranslate the partnership and cooperation that drive\r\nNEPAD and the African Union into broader solidarity\r\nby promoting cooperation with other subregional\r\ngroups in Asia. Such cooperation and solidarity\r\nbetween our two continents would greatly reflect the\r\nmessage of the Asia-Africa conference held at\r\nBandung in 1955: the Bandung spirit. Indonesia stands\r\nready to help strengthen such multilateralism and hopes\r\nthat NEPAD will be successfully implemented.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Igor S. Ivanov, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Ivanov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Our discussion of todays problems in Africa\r\nis important and timely, all the more so as the problems\r\nand threats faced by Africa in the context of\r\nglobalization are increasingly the problems and threats\r\nwe all face. That is why our strategic objective is a\r\ncommon one, namely, to break the vicious circle of\r\nunderdevelopment, conflict and disruption in\r\ndevelopment programmes. It is for that reason that we\r\nall attach such importance to a comprehensive\r\napproach to the key problems of Africa: crisis\r\nmanagement and prevention, poverty eradication,\r\neconomic recovery and the consolidation of democracy.\r\nThe establishment of the African Union was a\r\nmajor step in pooling the efforts of African nations.\r\nThe African Union is, quite rightly, focused on social\r\nand economic development. Peoples and States must\r\nindeed be free to choose their own future and to\r\nassume their responsibilities with regard to peace and\r\nsecurity issues, economic management, the sustainable\r\nuse of natural resources, efforts against corruption and\r\nthe effective allocation of resources to promote\r\ndevelopment. All of that was in fact taken into account\r\nin drafting the programme objectives of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD).\r\nMr. Seixas Da Costa (Portugal), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nRussia actively and directly participated in the\r\nelaboration of the Africa Action Plan adopted at the G-\r\n8 Summit held in Kananaskis. That document is aimed\r\nat facilitating the implementation of NEPAD and at\r\nother areas of cooperation where the G-8 can provide\r\nreal assistance in addressing the multifaceted\r\nchallenges Africa faces.\r\nWe strongly support United Nations efforts to\r\npromote the resolution of armed conflicts in Africa and\r\nto enhance interaction in this area between the United\r\nNations and the competent international, regional and\r\nsubregional organizations in Africa. We are convinced\r\nthat we must help to strengthen regional mechanisms\r\nfor early warning and conflict prevention and\r\nresolution, to build effective security structures in the\r\ncontinent and to address, among other things, post-\r\nconflict reconstruction problems. We hope that the\r\nPeace and Security Council created within the African\r\nUnion will contribute to achieving that goal.\r\nWe support the establishment of an Ad-Hoc\r\nAdvisory Group on African countries emerging from\r\nconflict, pursuant to a resolution of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. We are ready to participate actively in\r\nthe discussion of proposals to establish closer\r\ninteraction among the Security Council, the Economic\r\nand Social Council and other United Nations bodies on\r\nissues of post-conflict rehabilitation in Africa.\r\nRussia is familiar with Africas problems and\r\nunderstands them. Our country will continue to render\r\nassistance of all kinds to African States and to enhance\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation with them. We are\r\ncontributing in practical ways to solving the problem of\r\nAfricas external debt. In 2000, Russia wrote off $572\r\nmillion in debt owed by the poorest countries, mainly\r\nin Africa. Last year, we wrote off $904 million in debt.\r\nRussia will continue to make responsible efforts to\r\ntackle this problem. We will also continue to\r\nparticipate in humanitarian relief programmes,\r\nincluding programmes on combating HIV/AIDS and\r\nother dangerous diseases, natural-disaster management\r\nand assistance in human resource development for\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nOur cooperation with Africa pursues long-range\r\nobjectives. In that context, we are determined to\r\nimplement the decisions taken in Johannesburg at the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nWe sincerely wish African countries every\r\nsuccess in carrying out the large-scale tasks they face.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nIn cooperation with all other concerned members of the\r\ninternational community, Russia will do all it can to\r\nrealize the rightful aspirations of African nations.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Marcel Ranjeva,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Ranjeva (Madagascar) (spoke in French):\r\nLike those who have spoken before us, the Malagasy\r\ndelegation, which I am honoured to lead, cannot fail to\r\ntake this opportunity to express its deep gratitude for\r\nthe convening of this high-level meeting devoted to the\r\nNew Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD).\r\nAt a time when the international community is\r\nseeking ways and means to cooperate in the\r\nmultilateral and regional spheres to attain sustainable\r\ndevelopment, this meeting is a testament to the will of\r\nAfricas leaders to launch the continents economy. We\r\nmust not forget, however, that NEPAD is above all a\r\nprogramme designed by African heads of State,\r\nincluding President Wade of Senegal, a great friend of\r\nMadagascar of very wise and enlightened counsel who\r\nhas spared no effort to provide assistance to resolve the\r\nMalagasy post-electoral crisis, for which we are very\r\ngrateful.\r\nThis programme is designed to lay the\r\nfoundations for a partnership between Africa and the\r\ndeveloped world. Our continent is thus taking its\r\ndestiny in its own hands. We welcome the fact that we\r\nare taking responsibility for and accepting ownership\r\nof our future, especially since the partnership\r\nemphasizes democracy, transparency, good governance,\r\nthe rule of law and human rights.\r\nI would like to highlight a few issues that are of\r\nparticular importance to us. The first relates to the need\r\nto finance the programme so as to ensure that it does\r\nnot remain merely a good intention. As we have seen,\r\nofficial development assistance has been steadily\r\ndecreasing, despite the various pronouncements on this\r\nmatter, the most recent of which include the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nCurrent thinking supports development financing\r\nthrough foreign direct investment, above all from the\r\nprivate sector. But in poor countries like ours, it is not\r\nforeign investment that creates growth, but growth that\r\nattracts private foreign investment. The liberalization\r\npolicy underlying current economic doctrine is, in the\r\nlong term, beneficial, and we must therefore prepare\r\nfor it from cultural and technical standpoints. We must\r\ntake account of our infrastructures and make it possible\r\nfor the State to take action, for example by helping\r\nfarmers through the provision of subsidies and by other\r\nmeans. Competition must be promoted, but it must be\r\ncompetition between protagonists of equal strength. As\r\nLacordaire said, Between the strong and the weak,\r\nfreedom oppresses and the law protects.\r\nMadagascar, a country in which farmers make up\r\n80 per cent of the population, relies on its agriculture\r\nas the driving force of sustainable and rapid\r\ndevelopment. All developed countries have, at some\r\npoint in their history, subsidized their own agricultural\r\nsector. We must not therefore impose on the poor\r\ncountries draconian conditions to which the big Powers\r\nare not themselves subjected. The developed countries\r\nand economic unions allocate excessive subsidies to\r\nlivestock and agriculture, as well as to certain other\r\nindustries. Such practices contradict the rules of\r\nliberalism that apply in developed countries  yet\r\npoor countries are being refused social subsidies for\r\nfoodstuffs. We must not kill the patient in the process\r\nof curing the disease.\r\nWe must find other sources of financing for these\r\nvital public investments. This is not a new concept;\r\nstudies have been carried out on this matter by\r\nprominent experts. Solutions are discussed at every\r\nmajor international gathering, and I should like to take\r\nthis opportunity to recall a few of them. They include\r\nthe cancellation or, at least, significant reduction of the\r\ndebt, whose unfair rates and terms are denounced on a\r\nregular basis by the developing countries. I would also\r\nlike to mention the idea of taxing financial transactions\r\nor wealth produced through globalization. We must not\r\nfrom the outset, in the name of economic liberalism,\r\ndiscard the idea of international taxation; the world\r\ncannot be truly human without solidarity.\r\nThe second point that I would like to emphasize\r\nis that African peoples must set the terms themselves\r\nand benefit from the results, and their leaders must be\r\nparticularly committed to the well-being of their\r\npeoples.\r\nWe believe that the Peer Review Mechanism  a\r\nrevolutionary idea  is a tool with the potential to\r\nstrengthen fundamental rights in Africa. However, it\r\nmust not conflict with existing human rights\r\nmechanisms and, above all, must serve the general\r\ninterests of our peoples.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nIn conclusion, I appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to encourage and support NEPAD with a\r\nview to enabling Africa to emerge from its isolation\r\nand underdevelopment.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nMr. Leonardo Santos Simão, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Cooperation of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Simão (Mozambique): The New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development (NEPAD) is a vision and a\r\nholistic framework programme of the African Union,\r\ndeveloped by African leaders to promote Africas\r\nsustainable development. We Africans have created our\r\nown home-grown solutions to development problems\r\nand should strive for domestic partnerships between the\r\npublic and private sectors and civil society. In order to\r\navoid the marginalization of Africa and to improve its\r\nimage and credibility, the continent should enhance its\r\ncapacity to implement development programmes\r\nthrough self-financing mechanisms and the use of\r\nAfrican technical expertise, with the international\r\ncommunity playing a complementary role in those\r\nAfrican efforts.\r\nWe all seem to agree that the time has come to\r\nmove away from the information phase of NEPAD and\r\nto ensure its implementation. This is, indeed, a\r\nchallenging stage, and we need to address some\r\nimportant perceptions if we are to succeed. First, there\r\nis a perception that developed partners are more\r\ninterested in the political issues of NEPAD  the Peer\r\nReview Mechanism  while Africans are more\r\ninterested in the economic and social issues. It is\r\nimportant to note that both the political and the\r\neconomic objectives of NEPAD were set out by\r\nAfrican themselves and constitute challenges to be\r\novercome if the continent is to develop.\r\nFurthermore, Africa is aware that different\r\ncountries will experience different degrees of difficulty\r\nin reaching agreed goals. What those countries will\r\nrequire is encouragement to identify and overcome\r\nthose difficulties, instead of criticism and pressure on\r\nthe grounds that they are bad performers.\r\nSecondly, we Africans should avoid the\r\nperception that we are the eternal victims of the North.\r\nWithin the framework of NEPAD, there is room\r\nfor an effective partnership with the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations system.\r\nThat partnership will require improvements in the\r\nefficiency of the United Nations system with regard to\r\ndevelopment programmes devoted to the African\r\ncontinent. United Nations agencies and programmes\r\nshould therefore synchronize and harmonize their\r\nprogrammes to bring them into line with the objectives\r\nof NEPAD.\r\nThe United Nations should support institutional,\r\nfinancial and human capacity-building in Africa in\r\norder to establish and strengthen peace, stability and\r\ngood political, economic and corporate governance.\r\nThe Security Council should continue to pay special\r\nattention to the conflicts in Africa and should strive to\r\nbring about effective solutions in close cooperation\r\nwith Africans. The success of NEPAD and its\r\nsustainability will depend, ultimately, on the strength\r\nand performance of African institutions, at both the\r\nnational and the regional level.\r\nThe United Nations has an additional role to play\r\nin helping Africa to address issues of debt relief,\r\nmarket access and the empowerment of the African\r\nprivate sector. This high-level plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly thus provides us with the\r\nopportunity to renew our commitment to making Africa\r\na continent of peace and hope for a better future.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear and address by His Excellency Mr. Kamal\r\nKharrazi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran): It is\r\nindeed a great honour for me to have the opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the high-level plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to consider how to support the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development. What we have\r\nalready heard this morning from the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and from the heads of State and\r\ndelegations indicates that there has been a good\r\nassessment and analysis of the African predicament.\r\nThe reality of the situation faced by so many millions\r\nof people and in the greater part of the continent is\r\ngrim enough and calls for a real, serious and\r\ncomprehensive approach, policy and action on a scale\r\nand magnitude commensurate with the situation itself.\r\nLet me reiterate my countrys full solidarity with\r\nAfrican countries, all of which belong to the family of\r\ndeveloping nations. Last year, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, as the Chairman of the Group of 77, was, much to\r\nits satisfaction, closely involved in two important\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nprocesses related to Africa. One was the Third United\r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries,\r\nthe majority of which are located in the African\r\ncontinent. The Ministerial Declaration of the high-level\r\nsegment of the Economic and Social Council, whose\r\nchosen theme was Role of the United Nations system\r\nin supporting the efforts of African countries to achieve\r\nsustainable development, was the other. Both had\r\nconstructive and fruitful outcomes, on which several\r\ngood ideas were built, and produced tangible results.\r\nCurrently, my country has active bilateral and\r\nmultilateral cooperation with and a diplomatic presence\r\nin most African countries. With hindsight,\r\ndetermination and mutual cooperation, we have been\r\nable to contribute to a large number of projects and\r\nreconstruction plans in many African countries.\r\nBuilding infrastructure, the construction of hospitals\r\nand health clinics, and academic and scientific\r\ncooperation represent some general topics under which\r\nwe have contributed to the development of the poorer\r\nareas of the continent. Given the vulnerability of the\r\ncontinent to so many natural disasters, my country has\r\ncome up with financial and humanitarian assistance,\r\nincluding grants, on almost every occasion.\r\nFurthermore, in order to promote and facilitate\r\neconomic and commercial relations, my Government\r\nhas allocated a $200-million line of credit for Africa.\r\nFinally, the African renaissance, the rebirth we\r\nhave all been talking about in recent months and days,\r\ncan be initiated and undertaken in all earnestness only\r\nby Africans themselves and by African countries,\r\nindividually and collectively. The New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development embodies all these elements and\r\nis a step in the right direction. As far as the United\r\nNations system is concerned, it should undertake to\r\nintegrate all its various plans, programmes and\r\ninitiatives into a comprehensive policy framework\r\ncomprising all political, economic and social\r\ncomponents and with clear, well-defined roles and\r\nmandates for the relevant executing agencies and\r\ndepartments. Yes, there is a way forward for Africa.\r\nLet us all seize the moment and start on that road\r\nforward.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Souef Mohamed\r\nEl-Amine, Minister of State and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Cooperation, la Francophonie, the\r\nEnvironment and in charge of Comorians living abroad\r\nof the Comoros.\r\nMr. El-Amine (Comoros) (spoke in French): My\r\ndelegation is pleased to address the issue of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD).\r\nDesigned by Africans for Africans, this new framework\r\nfor development, with all of its objectives for\r\nremedying the continents major problems, has today\r\ncrystallized our leaders awareness of the vital need to\r\ntake in hand the destiny of our countries. Stifled by the\r\ndebt burden, shaken by violence of all sorts, weakened\r\nfrom all standpoints by war, decimated by such\r\ndiseases as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and\r\nmarginalized by a world trade system that is little\r\ninclined to recognize their efforts and constraints, these\r\ncountries hope to find their salvation in this new\r\ninitiative.\r\nIt must be recognized, however, that this\r\ninitiative has no guarantee of viability except insofar as\r\nit is supported by our partners. That is why, in\r\nexpressing our gratitude for this opportunity to\r\nintroduce our programme, it is our hope that the\r\ninternational community will become effectively\r\ninvolved in this process through consistent support. We\r\nfurther hope that a real partnership, without exclusions,\r\ncan be established between us and our partners and that\r\nthe United Nations, for its part, will see in this\r\ninitiative a framework for the extension of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s through support for NEPAD. NEPAD defines\r\nsectoral priorities within a regional framework that are\r\nalso part of a global context, in keeping with global\r\nconcerns.\r\nIn the framework of the implementation of its\r\nsustainable development policy, NEPAD will have to\r\ntake into account the specific case of small island\r\nStates. United to Africa but cut off from it\r\ngeographically, our small archipelagic States are\r\nsometimes the victims of their own isolation. Natural\r\ndisasters constantly strike them, destroying their\r\ndevelopment efforts and their natural wealth, which for\r\nthe most part involves their flora and fauna.\r\nFurthermore, the exploitation of our resources, their\r\nplundering by countries that have more powerful and\r\nmore sophisticated means, and the pollution of our\r\nmarine spaces along our coasts by large oil companies\r\nare phenomena that are growing and threatening the\r\nsurvival of human beings and of the species that\r\nconstitute the sole resources of our countries. That is\r\nwhy we hope that these issues will attract the interest\r\nof all our partners in helping our island countries to\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nestablish mechanisms to monitor and protect our land\r\nand marine environments for the well-being of our\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Joseph Philippe\r\nAntonio, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Haiti.\r\nMr. Antonio (Haiti) (spoke in French): I have the\r\nhonour to address the Assembly on behalf of the 14\r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM):\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize,\r\nDominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint\r\nKitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nWe are happy to see you, Sir, presiding over this\r\nhigh-level meeting of the General Assembly to\r\nconsider support to the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). We also welcome the dynamic\r\nleadership demonstrated by African States as they\r\nprepare this new partnership.\r\nDecade after decade, the African people have\r\nexperienced the worst that civilization has offered.\r\nOfficial statistics show that over 1.3 billion inhabitants\r\nlive below the poverty threshold on $1 per day, of\r\nwhich 350 million live in Africa. Africas share in the\r\nglobal poverty figure increased from 25 per cent to 30\r\nper cent between 1999 and 2002.\r\nThat situation prevails at a time when most\r\nAfrican countries are moving towards economic\r\nliberalism, with a view to meeting the demands of the\r\ninternational financial institutions. However, those\r\nsame statistics also show that since 1970 savings and\r\ninvestment have been decreasing in Africa. Africas\r\ndebt is estimated at $300 billion. It is a major obstacle\r\nto the socio-economic development of the continent.\r\nThat situation has a serious impact on trade, direct\r\ninvestment programmes and the process of economic\r\ngrowth. Nevertheless, investment is the prerequisite for\r\nthe creation of wealth capable of promoting economic\r\ngrowth aimed at sustainable development.\r\nWe must keep our eyes fixed on the goals set at\r\nDoha, Monterrey and Johannesburg. We must all work\r\ntogether to liberate men, women and children from the\r\nextreme poverty that dehumanizes them. We must act\r\nnow decisively and effectively to reduce the gap\r\nbetween rich and poor countries and to ensure that\r\nglobalization benefits all humanity.\r\nIn that context, the CARICOM States welcome\r\nNEPAD with satisfaction and reaffirm their solidarity\r\nand full cooperation with the African Governments and\r\npeoples. NEPAD is an ambitious initiative that\r\nredefines a partnership of responsibility and\r\ncommitment and attests to Africas resolve to take\r\nresponsibility for its own future. The challenge is\r\nindeed enormous. Overcoming it will require achieving\r\nand sustaining an annual growth rate of 7 per cent over\r\nthe next 15 years. According to some estimates, more\r\nthan $200 billion will be needed during that period just\r\nto reduce the effects of poverty.\r\nThis African initiative for Africa seeks to\r\neliminate poverty and underdevelopment. It requires\r\nthe full support of the international community,\r\nparticularly donors. It is an opportunity to break with\r\ntradition and to invite all donors to coordinate support\r\nfor Africa, taking into account the priorities set by the\r\nGovernments and people of Africa, not on the basis of\r\nconditions imposed from the outside.\r\nLike Africa, the Caribbean States believe that this\r\nis an historic opportunity to end the suffering of the\r\npeoples of Africa. The resources are available to do so.\r\nThe CARICOM States are of the view that a firm\r\ncommitment by the international community to\r\ntranslate words to action and by the continued\r\nresponsible leadership in Africa to work steadily\r\ntowards sustainable development in Africa will ensure\r\nits success.\r\nWe are confident that the peoples of Africa, with\r\ntheir energy and creativity, are yearning for an\r\nimprovement in their quality of life, as they await the\r\ngenuine support of their partners. We in CARICOM\r\nbelieve that this momentum must be capitalized on to\r\nfacilitate a fruitful partnership in order to reduce the\r\ngap in Africas development. Africas precious\r\nresources have been exploited by the major\r\nindustrialized economies for centuries. It is time that\r\nAfricas resources be utilized for the development of\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn conclusion, in addition to supporting NEPAD,\r\nthe international community has the moral obligation to\r\nsupport Africa in this effort. So many decades of\r\nunequal relations call for a new paradigm.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by Her Excellency Ms. Uschi Eid,\r\nVice-Minister and Parliamentary Secretary of State of\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nthe Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment of Germany.\r\nMs. Eid (Germany): The New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD) is a guiding vision for\r\nAfricas development in the twenty-first century. Wise\r\nand courageous African reformers have designed it for\r\ntheir continent. NEPAD recognizes that economic\r\ngrowth, sustainable development and an effective fight\r\nagainst poverty are based on the solid cornerstones of\r\ngood governance, democracy, the rule of law, respect\r\nfor human rights and a social market economy. That\r\ninterdependence is not a new perception. However, in\r\nNEPADs case it does not remain a misty theory;\r\nrather, it becomes the guiding principle of practical\r\npolicy. Thus, NEPAD is not only a programme; it is\r\nalso a forum for reformed leadership in Africa.\r\nNEPAD now has to grapple with implementation\r\nefforts. Visions of reform must be translated into\r\neveryday work. I wish my African colleagues the\r\nnecessary patience, strength and perseverance. The\r\nGerman Government provides broad support to the\r\nAfrican countries in this venture bilaterally, as well as\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations. Africa and\r\nNEPAD can count on the solidarity of the international\r\ncommunity. Germany considers NEPAD to be a basis\r\nfor a new and enhanced partnership with Africa. With\r\nits new approaches, NEPAD opens up great\r\nopportunities for self-determined development.\r\nThis new way of thinking is already breaking\r\nground. The best evidence of that is the African record\r\nof success in overcoming armed conflict in recent\r\nmonths. Let me just mention Madagascar, Angola and\r\nthe peace agreement between Rwanda and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. That is the\r\nsuccessful effort of African diplomacy, and we\r\ncongratulate the African statesmen and politicians\r\ninvolved on that achievement. Furthermore, NEPAD\r\nhas withstood the first test with regard to building and\r\nstrengthening of African conflict-management\r\ninstitutions. The resolution adopted at the constitutive\r\nsummit of the African Union in Durban to set up a pan-\r\nAfrican peace and security council is a very tangible\r\ndevelopment of the peace and security initiative\r\nembedded in NEPAD.\r\nIt is important that NEPAD willingness to reform\r\nand its dynamism continue to hold sway. It is crucially\r\nimportant to NEPAD success that it maintain its clear\r\nprofile and remain a programmatic platform and\r\noperative framework for visionary leadership in Africa.\r\nIn Durban, the African Union agreed to the peer review\r\nmechanism developed within the framework of\r\nNEPAD. We welcome it, as good governance,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and corporate governance are\r\nbecoming an issue of a form of dialogue among\r\nAfrican States. The peer review process opens up\r\nsubstantial opportunities. If it is executed honestly,\r\nthoroughly and transparently, it will strengthen Africas\r\ncredibility in advocating sustainable reforms.\r\nThe Peer Review Mechanism thereby contributes\r\nto improving the general political and economic\r\nenvironment and to increasing the continents\r\nattractiveness as an investment destination of great\r\ngrowth potential in qualitative terms. Hence it is\r\nimportant for as many African countries as possible to\r\nstate their willingness to participate in the peer review\r\nand, if the process is put into effect, to do so as\r\nspeedily as possible.\r\nNEPAD, as a spearhead for reforms in Africa, is\r\nexposed to difficult challenges. These include the\r\nsituation in Zimbabwe. Let me say that we are greatly\r\nconcerned about what is happening there. The events in\r\nZimbabwe jeopardize NEPADs credibility and\r\nsustainability. It would indeed be desirable if\r\nZimbabwes neighbours were to react to the situation\r\nmore distinctly and decisively. The irresponsible policy\r\npursued by the Government in Harare puts prospects\r\nfor development, and the stability of the whole region\r\nof southern Africa, at risk.\r\nThe international community explicitly endorses\r\nthe beginning of a new African age of reform rung in\r\nby NEPAD. One thing is clear: the tremendous\r\nchallenges Africa is facing can be mastered only\r\njointly, in solidarity between the North and the South.\r\nAs a member of the Group of Eight (G-8), Germany\r\nhas accepted NEPADs invitation to establish a new\r\npartnership based on a foundation of mutual\r\nresponsibility and respect. With their Africa Action\r\nPlan, the G-8 heads of State and Government, meeting\r\nat Kananaskis, gave a political response to NEPAD as a\r\npolitical vision for the future of the African continent\r\nbecause we want a strong Africa.\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to\r\nthe next speaker, May I remind representatives that the\r\nlimit for statements in this debate is five minutes.\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hans Dahlgren, State Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs of Sweden.\r\nMr. Dahlgren (Sweden): The presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union has already outlined the positive view\r\nof the European Union with regard to the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD). I\r\nconcur with everything in that speech, and I will\r\ntherefore limit myself to a few remarks.\r\nWe who speak today are all aware of the political\r\nand economic problems facing Africa. They are\r\nchallenging our best common values. They are a threat\r\nto the security and welfare of us all. NEPAD has\r\ntherefore been warmly welcomed as an expression of\r\nAfricas determination to assume strong leadership for\r\npoverty reduction and for development. African leaders\r\nhave set an agenda for renewal of the continent based\r\non African ownership and commitment. NEPAD puts\r\nthe right focus on peace and stability, on democracy\r\nand human rights, and on good political and economic\r\ngovernance as prerequisites for development.\r\nIn realizing the objectives of NEPAD, one can\r\nbuild on important achievements made in recent years\r\nin the framework of the United Nations. The\r\nMillennium Declaration outlines what we have to do\r\ntogether. The Monterrey Consensus signals measures to\r\nbe taken in the areas of mobilizing domestic resources,\r\ntrade, private investment, debt relief and official\r\ndevelopment assistance. Add to that the outcome of the\r\nJohannesburg Summit. Much of this can also be found\r\nin NEPAD.\r\nNow, how does one translate all these\r\ncommitments into concrete action? There are several\r\nanswers. One is by focusing, at the national level, on\r\npoverty reduction strategies as instruments to\r\nimplement NEPAD principles and to realize national\r\nownership of development. Another is by focusing on\r\nstrengthening competence and capacity, on involving\r\ncivil society and the private sector, as well as on\r\npartnership and coordination between African countries\r\nand their external partners, thereby making their joint\r\nefforts more effective. In addition, the focus should\r\nalso be on the United Nations systems obvious role in\r\ncoordinating and supporting the implementation of\r\nNEPAD.\r\nNEPAD emphasizes regional cooperation, and\r\nSweden stands ready to support that. We have recently\r\nadopt0ed a strategy for support to regional\r\ndevelopment cooperation in sub-Saharan Africa on the\r\ncontinental level through the African Union, the\r\nEconomic Commission for Africa and the African\r\nDevelopment Bank, as well as through\r\nsubregional organizations. The focus is on conflict\r\nmanagement, economic cooperation and integration,\r\ninfrastructure and national resources.\r\nWithout peace and security, long-term\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication are utopian ideas.\r\nWith NEPAD, African leaders have shown their firm\r\ncommitment to assume responsibility for peace and\r\nsecurity on their continent, ranging from prevention to\r\nconflict resolution. Sweden strongly supports that\r\nambition. Sweden also welcomes the decision of the\r\nAfrican Union to establish a Peace and Security\r\nCouncil and to strengthen its work on conflict\r\nmanagement.\r\nPromoting peace and security in Africa will also\r\ncontinue to be a priority for the United Nations. In\r\naddition, the G-8 has made welcome commitments to\r\ndevelop, together with its African partners, a joint plan\r\nto strengthen African capabilities to undertake peace\r\nsupport operations.\r\nMuch of this may sound abstract, but there are\r\nalso very concrete examples of what can be done. Look\r\nat Sierra Leone, a clear case of effective international\r\nconflict management where the United Nations, the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and other partners have played a crucial\r\nrole in turning a long-standing and bloody civil war\r\ninto a credible peace process, culminating in peaceful\r\nelections in May this year. It is of crucial importance\r\nfor me and my Government that the huge investment\r\nthat has been made in human and financial resources in\r\nSierra Leone, and the lessons learned from that success\r\nstory, are not now be lost because of continued conflict\r\nin the Mano River Union area. Sweden and the\r\nEuropean Union stand firmly behind ECOWAS in its\r\nefforts to broker a peaceful solution to the ongoing\r\nconflict in Liberia.\r\nThe Acing President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Mohamed\r\nAffey, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of Kenya.\r\nMr. Affey (Kenya): Let me commend Mr. Jan\r\nKavan on the able manner in which he has been\r\nsteering the affairs of this session. It is a great honour\r\nfor me, on behalf of His Excellency Daniel arap Moi,\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya, to address this\r\nhigh-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD). The decision by the General Assembly to\r\nhold this meeting is timely. It is also a recognition of\r\nthe importance of NEPAD to the African peoples and\r\ntheir development partners.\r\nSeveral decades after independence, African\r\ncountries are still grappling with problems such as\r\npoverty, disease and illiteracy. Over the past decade,\r\nAfrica has continued to sink further into the abyss of\r\noblivion, owing to the marginalization brought about\r\nby globalization, the effects of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, the heavy debt burden and rising levels of\r\npoverty, hunger and malnutrition. For Africa to be able\r\nto surmount these problems, concrete measures are\r\nrequired in resolving the debt crisis, providing market\r\naccess for African products, funding health services,\r\ndeveloping infrastructure, protecting the environment,\r\ndeveloping human resources and, especially, ensuring\r\nthe education of our children. We should not lose sight\r\nof the fact that our future will depend on todays\r\ninvestment in our children. The health, education and\r\ngeneral well-being of our children is therefore the\r\nfoundation for Africas development. We should strive\r\nto uphold childrens rights in line with the millennium\r\ndevelopment goals and the goals set out in A World\r\nFit for Children, adopted by the General Assembly at\r\nits twenty-seventh special session.\r\nAfrica has seen several initiatives aimed at\r\nresolving the myriad problems affecting the continent.\r\nHowever, none of them has been able to achieve the\r\ndesired results, largely due to the lack of goodwill from\r\nour partners, the inadequacy of resources for\r\nimplementation and the limited ownership and\r\nparticipation of African Governments and peoples. It is\r\nout of this frustration that African leaders have agreed\r\non the New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD) as the continents development blueprint,\r\nwhich places emphasis on the twin principles of\r\nownership and partnership. It is worth noting that the\r\npriorities outlined in the NEPAD initiative are in line\r\nwith the millennium development goals adopted by\r\nworld leaders in September 2000 on the occasion of the\r\nMillennium Summit. The recent launching of the\r\nAfrican Union by African leaders is testimony to the\r\ncommitment of African leaders to strengthening the\r\ninstitutional mechanism for the implementation of\r\nNEPAD.\r\nKenya continues to play a major role in the\r\nNEPAD process. The President of the Republic of\r\nKenya last June hosted the Eastern African summit on\r\nNEPAD, which came up with a way forward for\r\nNEPAD in the subregion. To ensure the integration of\r\nNEPAD into domestic policy and the participation of\r\nall stakeholders, a private-sector task force has been\r\nestablished, which is working with the Government in\r\nmainstreaming NEPAD priorities.\r\nAt the regional level, Kenya is committed to the\r\nprinciples of regional integration, one of the building\r\nblocks of the African Union. Kenya has actively\r\nsupported and is a member of several regional\r\neconomic integration blocs. In addition, Kenya has\r\ncontinued its efforts in peace-building in the region, as\r\nevidenced by its role in the Sudan and Somalia peace\r\nprocesses.\r\nWe in Africa were encouraged by the warm\r\nreception extended to NEPAD by the high-level\r\nsegment of the Economic and Social Council of July\r\n2001, the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment of March 2002 in Monterrey, the G8\r\nsummit and the recently concluded World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. We further commend the G8\r\nfor coming up with the plan of action for NEPAD\r\nadopted at Kananaskis, Canada, in July 2002. We are\r\nconvinced that, if NEPAD is to succeed, the support of\r\nthe United Nations and the international community is\r\nparamount. In this regard, this meeting should come up\r\nwith a way forward for the support of NEPAD by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, as we embark on the final review\r\nand appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, we expect\r\nNEPAD to take up its rightful position as the United\r\nNations and the international communitys policy\r\ndocument for Africas development.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Habib Ben\r\nYahia, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Yahia (Tunisia) (spoke in French): Today,\r\nour Assembly is discussing a matter which is of\r\nparamount importance to the future of Africa.\r\nMy country has worked tirelessly to promote\r\npeace, security and development on our continent. We\r\nhighly welcome the General Assemblys decision to\r\ndevote a days debate to the New Partnership for\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD) in support of our\r\ncontinents development efforts. Africa has a great\r\nwealth of natural resources and human potential and is\r\nnow determined to take charge of its own future and to\r\nrely on itself in facing the challenges before it. In that\r\nspirit, it drew on its fundamental beliefs to formulate\r\nNEPAD, which is strategic and comprehensive and\r\nseeks development based on African resources to avoid\r\nunderdevelopment in an environment of peace, security\r\nand stability, which are prerequisites of any\r\ndevelopment effort.\r\nIn moving into this innovative phase, Africa is\r\nprepared to use its own resources. Attaining this\r\nambitious programme, however, will be possible only\r\nwith the help of the international community in the\r\nsuccessful implementation of NEPAD as an expression\r\nof the African peoples aspirations to a better future.\r\nThe Millennium Summit stressed the particular\r\nneeds of Africa and affirmed the priority of African\r\ndevelopment. The heads of State therefore decided to\r\ntake special steps in respect of Africa, including debt\r\ncancellation, improved access to markets, increasing\r\nofficial development assistance and promoting direct\r\nforeign investment and the transfer of technology. It\r\nwas also decided to help the continent stem the spread\r\nof disease, in particular HIV/AIDS.\r\nAfrica appreciates the support voiced by many\r\nwealthy countries at the Monterrey International\r\nConference on Financing for Development. Africa\r\nneeds those promises to be kept as soon as possible,\r\ngiven the difficulties facing it. We were extremely\r\npleased in that connection to note the positive response\r\nof the G8 to NEPAD. We also welcome the\r\nencouraging outcome of the 2000 Europe-Africa\r\nsummit, the progress achieved at the France-Africa\r\nsummit and the fruitful cooperation between Japan and\r\nAfrican countries under the First, Second and Third\r\nTokyo International Conferences on African\r\nDevelopment. We also welcome the promising dialogue\r\nbetween China and Africa.\r\nOur world today is increasingly interdependent.\r\nAll of our interests are interlinked, as are our concerns.\r\nIf allowed to continue, the imbalance between rich and\r\npoor could jeopardize security in the prosperous\r\ncountries. It is essential to ensure harmonious\r\ndevelopment for the welfare of the entire human race.\r\nSolidarity is therefore a prerequisite for building the\r\nbetter world to which we all aspire.\r\nTunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has\r\nlong been aware of these truths. In the early 1990s, he\r\nspoke of the need to reach an agreement on peace,\r\npartnership and development between the developed\r\nand the developing countries. He has always stressed\r\nthe positive impact of active solidarity between rich\r\nand poor and the value of mutual assistance among\r\nStates through his initiative to establish a world\r\nsolidarity fund to be used to combat poverty and\r\nexclusion. In that context, my country welcomes the\r\nregional and international broad support for this\r\ninitiative and counts on the General Assemblys active\r\nassistance in ensuring that this humanitarian\r\nprogramme be realized as soon as possible.\r\nWe are meeting here at a time when hope is being\r\nreborn in Africa. In July at Durban, our continent\r\nentered a new phase of its history with the\r\nestablishment of the African Union, thus attaining the\r\naspiration of African peoples to solidarity and unity.\r\nConflicts in many parts of our continent are now being\r\nresolved and Africa is recognizing the value of peace,\r\ndemocratization and good governance. The time has\r\ncome to support Africas efforts with the assistance\r\nnecessary to pursue the promising impetus. We all hope\r\nfor good results from this endeavour. I reaffirm\r\nAfricas and Tunisias desire to build a world of peace,\r\nstability and harmony.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by Her Excellency Baroness Valerie\r\nAmos, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United\r\nKingdom.\r\nBaroness Amos (United Kingdom): This is an\r\nimportant occasion and it is entirely right that we\r\nshould come together to consider how to support the\r\nNew Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD).\r\nThe United Nations is the right place for us to do so.\r\nAfricas problems are the worlds problems.\r\nConflict and State failure  all too prevalent in\r\nAfrica  create poverty, refugees and opportunities for\r\ntransnational crime. They can undermine the credibility\r\nof the United Nations and they may breed terrorism.\r\nNEPAD represents a unique opportunity to\r\naddress the challenges facing Africa. It defines a new\r\napproach to African development and holds out the\r\npromise of an end to conflicts which have devastated\r\nthe continent and continue to hold back its\r\ndevelopment; of the entrenchment of sound economic\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nand political governance which will root out corruption\r\nand secure justice; of the release of Africas productive\r\npotential through access to trade; and of winning\r\ninvestment to build stronger economies. All these are\r\nvital and interconnected issues, but in the time\r\navailable, I would like to focus on the need to resolve\r\nand manage conflict in Africa.\r\nThe Group of Eight (G-8) Africa Action Plan\r\ncommits the worlds leading industrialized nations to\r\nsupporting Africas efforts to tackle conflict and to\r\naddress some of the causes and drivers of conflict in\r\nAfrica that lie in the international sphere: for example,\r\narms flows, the exploitation of economic resources by\r\nexternal actors and weak international conflict-\r\nmanagement mechanisms.\r\nLet me here pay tribute to the Secretary-General.\r\nHe has demonstrated that with leadership, courage and\r\ncommitment, results can be achieved. He has shown\r\npractical commitment to increasing the impact of\r\nUnited Nations operations on the ground, and he has\r\nour fullest support.\r\nThe United Kingdom is committed to supporting\r\nboth international and African efforts to reduce conflict\r\nin Africa. This is an area where a common commitment\r\nand real political will can have a huge impact. We\r\nknow that peace and security are the essential\r\nprerequisites for putting the continent on the road to\r\nsustainable development. Success in resolving Africas\r\nlong-running conflicts would transform the lives of\r\nmillions of people, and we are taking concrete action to\r\nsupport efforts to tackle specific conflicts on the\r\ncontinent.\r\nSierra Leone demonstrates what can be achieved\r\nwhen Africa and the international community work in\r\npartnership. The country is at peace, refugees and the\r\ninternally displaced are returning home and people are\r\nrebuilding their shattered society. We know that a long-\r\nterm commitment is required. Peace will be secure only\r\nonce the problems of weak governance, control over\r\nnatural resources  for example, diamonds  and\r\nregional instability have been addressed.\r\nI am also pleased that, with the establishment of a\r\ncontact group, the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations should be able to give more effective\r\nand urgent assistance to regional efforts to resolve the\r\nconflict in Liberia.\r\nIn Sudan the peace process has undoubtedly\r\nsuffered a setback with the escalation of fighting in the\r\nsouth and the suspension of talks. But we will continue\r\nto back the peace process as part of the international\r\nobserver team supporting the negotiations of the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development. We are\r\npressing all sides to return to the negotiating table, as\r\nthat is the only way to achieve peace.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we see\r\nhopeful signs of a major breakthrough due to African\r\nefforts. The United Kingdom has dispatched a joint\r\nmission with the United States to see how we can help\r\nthe parties drive this forward. Looking ahead, we have\r\nbegun to explore ways of working with our partners to\r\nassist the development of a new Congolese national\r\narmy. We are committed to supporting a comprehensive\r\nand inclusive process of national and regional\r\nreconciliation. In the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, as in Sierra Leone, we recognize the regional\r\ndimensions of the conflict and we have been supporting\r\nAfrican and international efforts to address them,\r\nincluding the peace process in Burundi.\r\nIn Angola, we have seen significant steps towards\r\na sustainable political solution. It is essential that the\r\nGovernment of Angola take effective action on\r\neconomic reform and governance.\r\nThe progress we have seen in these, the most\r\nlong-running and intractable conflicts in Africa, shows\r\nthat things are changing. It is a sign that the NEPAD\r\nprinciples are being put into practice. We welcome this\r\ndetermination. We are ready to work with it to put an\r\nend to conflict in Africa. African has huge potential;\r\ntogether we can work to realize it.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Anastassios\r\nYannitsis, Alternate Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nGreece.\r\nMr. Yannitsis (Greece): Earlier this morning, the\r\nForeign Minister of Denmark, in his capacity as\r\nPresident of the European Union, made a statement\r\nwith which we agree. I therefore wish only to make\r\nsome additional remarks.\r\nGreece welcomes the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD) as an African-led\r\ninitiative that aims at the fulfilment of promises for\r\nAfricas development through domestic, regional and\r\ninternational partnerships. We believe we stand before\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\na new concept that has to succeed in implementing\r\ndevelopment strategies and improving donor-recipient\r\nrelationships.\r\nThere is an urgent need for a new age in Africas\r\ndevelopment to emerge. In our effort to fight poverty\r\nwe have as tools the lessons learned from the decade of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF), which showed us\r\nthat ambitious goals for development and growth both\r\ninspire and serve to promote more committed efforts.\r\nNEPAD is the most pivotal of those goals. We welcome\r\nthe inspiration provided by Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria,\r\nSenegal and South Africa, as well as the decisions of\r\nthe Organization of African Unity and the strong\r\ninternational support expressed at the Group of Eight\r\n(G-8) Summit held in Kananaskis, which adopted the\r\nAfrica Action Plan. We also welcome the contribution\r\nof major United Nations conferences, including the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, as well as the European Union process\r\nfor a new platform to further develop relations between\r\nthe European Union and Africa.\r\nAfrican ownership, partnership among African\r\ncountries and with the international community and\r\nshared responsibilities are key elements for NEPADs\r\nsuccess.\r\nHalving the proportion of people living in\r\nextreme poverty by 2015 is a very serious and\r\nimportant priority of the international community.\r\nTackling the problems of HIV/AIDS and other\r\ninfectious diseases, along with dealing with such issues\r\nas the problem of external debt, the education of girls,\r\nhuman rights violations, limited resources, institution-\r\nbuilding, bridging the infrastructure gap and creating\r\nlarger markets in Africa, make up our main challenge.\r\nOur means lie within our political will, the\r\naccumulated experience of the agencies and\r\norganizations of the United Nations system and the\r\ncoordinated efforts of all development partners.\r\nNEPAD gives us a chance to re-address, in a holistic\r\nand action-oriented manner, the problems that have\r\nafflicted the continent for centuries. With the\r\nidentification of priority areas and with proposals for\r\nspecific actions and programmes, Africa could assume\r\nan enhanced role on the global stage on the basis of\r\nsustainable, long-term development.\r\nLast but not least, let me say that Africas\r\ndevelopment will be one of the main priorities of\r\nGreeces agenda during its presidency of the European\r\nUnion during the first half of 2003. We will do our\r\nutmost so that the upcoming European Union-Africa\r\nsummit, to be held in April 2003, will not only increase\r\ncooperation between the two partners but will also\r\nproduce tangible results to the benefit of the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nCurrently, Greece is contributing to the\r\ndevelopment of Africa through its participation in the\r\nEuropean Union and through other international\r\norganizations. Furthermore, we are also contributing,\r\nwithin our financial means, to the Trust Fund for the\r\nEducational and Training Programme for Southern\r\nAfrica, to the Trust Fund for the Transport and\r\nCommunication Decade in Africa and to the Trust Fund\r\nfor African Development. We are hoping that in the\r\nnext year we will be able to double our national\r\ncontributions to those three funds.\r\nWe believe that if NEPAD is combined\r\nconstructively with already existing strategies and\r\nefforts, it will make the vision of this initiative a reality\r\nand fulfil its goals by as early as 2015 for the benefit of\r\nall people.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Nobutake\r\nOdano, Director-General for African Affairs of the\r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs of Japan.\r\nMr. Odano (Japan): It is my privilege to have an\r\nopportunity to talk about Japans cooperation with the\r\nNew Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD),\r\nwhich is a bold initiative by Africans for Africas\r\nfuture.\r\nToday the world recognizes that the problems\r\nAfrica is facing are great challenges not only for the\r\nregion itself but also for the international community\r\nas a whole.\r\nJapan has been making efforts to revive global\r\ninterest in Africas issues through the process of the\r\nTokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment (TICAD) since the early 1990s, when\r\nAfro-pessimism and aid fatigue prevailed in the\r\ninternational community. We also believe the growing\r\nmomentum within the Group of Eight (G-8) on Africas\r\nissues, culminating in the G-8 Africa Action Plan,\r\noriginated at the Kyusyu-Okinawa Summit meeting in\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\n2000. That was where Japan, as the G-8 chair, took the\r\ninitiative to invite leaders of African countries to an\r\noutreach session held in Tokyo. Japan had thus started\r\nto articulate the importance of African issues in the\r\ninternational arena within a new perspective. It\r\ntherefore gives me great pleasure to discuss Africas\r\nchallenges today.\r\nJapan promoted the TICAD process by hosting\r\nthe First Tokyo International Conference on African\r\nDevelopment in 1993, the second in 1998 and the\r\nTICAD ministerial-level meeting in 2001. Japan will\r\nconvene TICAD III in October next year, which will\r\nmark the tenth year of the TICAD process. That\r\nprocess is a major pillar of Japans cooperation for\r\nAfrican development.\r\nThroughout that 10-year period, Japan has\r\nconsistently advocated the importance of ownership by\r\nAfrica of its development and partnership with the\r\ninternational community which supports Africas\r\nownership. From that point of view, Japan welcomes\r\nthe elaboration of the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and the tangible efforts Africa\r\nis making under NEPAD, and regards them as a clear\r\ndemonstration of Africas ownership. Japan appreciates\r\nAfrican leadership. Japan also appreciates the decision\r\nof African countries to introduce the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism in order to ensure their own steady\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nAs for the partnership with Africa, Japan\r\ncontinues to support NEPAD through the TICAD\r\nprocess. Japan offered to all stakeholders of African\r\ncountries and their development partners the first\r\nopportunity to discuss NEPAD together on the occasion\r\nof the TICAD ministerial-level meeting last year in\r\nTokyo. Furthermore, in June this year, Japan convened\r\na TICAD-NEPAD dialogue in New York and started\r\nthe new initiative to strengthen synergy between\r\nTICAD and NEPAD. Many members will recall that\r\nthe Plan of Implementation adopted at the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development explicitly\r\nmentions the TICAD process and regards it as an\r\nimportant initiative that supports NEPAD.\r\nKeeping in mind the G-8 Africa Action Plan in\r\nresponse to NEPAD, Japan announced its programme\r\nof solidarity between Japan and Africa in June, which\r\ndefines Japans concrete action for cooperation on\r\nAfrica. In addition, Japans Foreign Minister, Yoriko\r\nKawaguchi, delivered a policy speech on Japans\r\ncooperation for African development at the joint\r\ninvitation of the African Union and the Economic\r\nCommission on Africa when she visited Ethiopia three\r\nweeks ago. On such occasions, Japan reiterates its\r\ncommitment to cooperation based on human-centred\r\ndevelopment, Asia-Africa cooperation and peace\r\nconsolidation efforts.\r\nFirst, with regard to human-centred development\r\nin Africa, Japan makes consistent efforts in sectors\r\nsuch as education and health, recognizing that human\r\nresources development is the foundation of nation-\r\nbuilding. Since TICAD II in 1998, Japan has carried\r\nout a $740 million five-year plan of grant aid. That\r\nassistance has enabled 2.4 million children to study in\r\nclassrooms, 2.9 million people to have access to safe\r\nwater and 215 million people to benefit from improved\r\nmedical conditions. Among Japans educational\r\ninitiatives in Africa is its decision to extend assistance\r\nworth more than $2 billion over the next five years to\r\nlow-income countries, including countries in Africa.\r\nIndeed, through the TICAD process, Japan\r\npromotes Asia-Africa cooperation. A symbolic project\r\nin that regard is New Rice for Africa. Japan wishes to\r\nsee the development experiences of East Asia shared\r\nby Africans and others. Of course, private-sector\r\ncooperation for African development will be promoted\r\nthrough the TICAD process.\r\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize that there will be\r\nno stability and prosperity in the world in the twenty-\r\nfirst century unless Africas problems are resolved.\r\nDespite the severe constraints surrounding its official\r\ndevelopment assistance, Japan remains determined to\r\nwork with Africa. At the same time, development\r\ncannot be sustained for long unless the African\r\ncountries address the challenges and regard them as\r\ntheir own. We hope this meeting will reaffirm Africas\r\ndetermination to steadily implement NEPAD and the\r\ninternational communitys determination to support\r\nNEPAD. Japan would like to renew its commitment to\r\nadvancing together with Africa, hand in hand, leading\r\nup to the TICAD III meeting in October next year.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear a statement by His Excellency Mr. Peter Tesch,\r\nchairman of the delegation of Australia.\r\nMr. Tesch (Australia): Australia warmly\r\nwelcomes the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). Australia believes that\r\nNEPAD articulates an integrated African vision for a\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nnew African future and a set of principles for achieving\r\nthat vision. Created by Africans for Africans, it is a\r\nhistoric new partnership. Based on the principles of\r\ngood political and economic governance, democracy\r\nand market-led economic growth, it deserves strong\r\nsupport.\r\nNEPAD acknowledges that the primary\r\nresponsibility for lifting Africa out of poverty lies with\r\nAfrica itself. It is, therefore, qualitatively different\r\nfrom past initiatives designed to foster development in\r\nAfrica that, regrettably, have failed to realize the goal\r\nof sustainable development.\r\nAustralia commends the forward-looking African\r\nleaders who recognized that development has to be\r\nunderpinned by a strong commitment to international\r\nstandards of good governance, sound economic\r\nmanagement, respect for human rights and the rule of\r\nlaw, peace and security.\r\nIt is vital that these laudable principles be\r\nrealized through real commitment by African countries\r\nto their implementation and, importantly, through\r\nsupport by the rest of the international community for\r\nthat endeavour. Those commitments will be\r\nfundamental in helping Africa create an environment\r\nwhere new investment and economic growth can\r\nflourish. They will also assist in preventing and ending\r\nendemic armed conflict and in overcoming the\r\ndevelopment challenges that Africa faces.\r\nAustralia is encouraged by the commitments\r\nembodied in the Declaration on Democracy, Political,\r\nEconomic and Corporate Governance, issued by the\r\nNEPAD heads of State in June 2002. We are also\r\nencouraged by the African Peer Review Mechanism.\r\nThe early and consistent implementation of those\r\nprinciples will establish their credibility and will be a\r\nkey part of the success of NEPAD. It needs to be said\r\nthat the opposite would also be true.\r\nNEPADs focus on securing and reaping the\r\nbenefits of further trade liberalization is clear-sighted,\r\nnecessary and welcome. Trade liberalization represents\r\none of the single most important steps that can be taken\r\nto help eradicate poverty and encourage sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAustralia is a leading advocate of trade\r\nliberalization, particularly in the field of agriculture, a\r\nsector of special importance to African countries. We\r\nhave long advocated ending farm subsidies in\r\ndeveloped countries. Not only are those subsidies\r\nhugely expensive  the amount spent on them is more\r\nthan Africas combined economic output  but they\r\nare also highly damaging to Africas development\r\nprospects. Australia will continue to work with\r\ndeveloping country partners to create a fair\r\ninternational trading system in agricultural products,\r\nincluding in the Doha trade round.\r\nWhile trade liberalization and private-sector-led\r\ngrowth are crucial, we recognize the importance of\r\ndevelopment assistance programmes. HIV/AIDS is a\r\nserious threat to development and will remain a major\r\nfocus of Australias development assistance\r\nprogramme for Africa. Australias other priorities,\r\ngovernance and education, including working through\r\nthe African Virtual University in Nairobi, and efforts to\r\nbridge the digital divide are also relevant to NEPAD\r\npriorities.\r\nNEPAD provides a promising and practical path\r\ntowards Africas sustainable development. The\r\nchallenge for Africans, and indeed for all of us in the\r\ninternational community, is to combine our efforts to\r\nhelp make it work.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Nassir\r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser, the chairman of the delegation of\r\nQatar.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nshould like to express my pleasure at participating in\r\nthis high-level plenary meeting of the General\r\nAssembly to consider ways and means to support the\r\nNew Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD).\r\nFirst of all, on behalf of my Government, I should\r\nlike thank the international community for entrusting\r\nthe State of Qatar with the honour of holding the World\r\nTrade Organizations Fourth Ministerial Conference in\r\nDoha, which produced the Doha Development Agenda.\r\nThat Agenda laid the foundation for conducting\r\nintensive and important negotiations on a variety of\r\nissues in the areas of trade, investment flows and aid,\r\nalleviating the debt burden, capacity-building and\r\nimproving developing countries access to international\r\nmarkets.\r\nThe Conference strongly emphasized the\r\nprinciples and objectives set out in the Marrakesh\r\nAgreement, which established the foundation of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). Furthermore, the\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nparticipants pledged to reject protectionism, confirming\r\nthe key role that trade can play in promoting economic\r\ndevelopment, and in fighting poverty, by\r\nacknowledging the need of all our peoples to benefit\r\nfrom the increasing opportunities and benefits of\r\nprosperity offered by the multilateral trading system.\r\nThe Conference also gave participants the opportunity\r\nto devote special attention to the various problems\r\nfacing African and developing countries in particular,\r\nas well as to the formidable obstacles hindering their\r\nefforts to achieve economic and social development.\r\nThe Doha Conference succeeded in achieving\r\nsome positive results. It enabled the least developed\r\ncountries, the overwhelming majority of which are in\r\nAfrica, as well as other developing countries, including\r\nAfrican nations, to win important concessions, such as\r\nthe removal of obstacles to their commodities \r\nparticularly agricultural goods, the main exports of\r\nAfrican States  and services. The Conference\r\nadopted a definitive programme of action covering the\r\nperiod up to 2005, and included a request to the WTO\r\nDirector-General to submit by the end of 2002 a\r\nprogress report on the implementation of the\r\nprogramme of action.\r\nSince the Secretary-General submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly his report entitled The causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/52/871), the\r\ninternational community has devoted special attention\r\nto African issues, ranging from peacemaking, post-\r\nconflict peace-building and sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment, to mobilizing resources for Africas\r\ndevelopment. In that context, we highly appreciate and\r\nvalue the Secretary-Generals efforts and initiatives\r\naimed at ending conflicts, building peace and\r\nalleviating the suffering inflicted on Africa by such\r\nconflicts.\r\nHowever, Africas problems are not confined to\r\nwars and conflicts; they also involve the economic and\r\nsocial areas. For instance, 44 per cent or more of\r\nAfricas population lives in abject poverty, and the\r\nentire continent is threatened by the spread of\r\ninfectious diseases and epidemics, particularly\r\nHIV/AIDS. Malaria and other endemic diseases also\r\npose a grave threat to the lives of millions of people. In\r\nthat connection, we appreciate and value the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations system agencies, including the\r\nBretton Woods institutions, to assist African countries\r\nin several areas, including sustainable human\r\ndevelopment, health, education, promoting good\r\ngovernance, strengthening capacities for the\r\nmanagement of financial and business establishments\r\nand macroeconomic management, enhancing\r\ntransparency and fighting corruption.\r\nAfrican countries efforts to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment and to solve the aforementioned problems\r\nare hindered by foreign debt burdens that altogether\r\nexceed the continents gross national income of goods\r\nand services by more than 30 per cent.\r\nInternational support is of utmost importance and\r\nis urgently needed in order to increase official\r\ndevelopment assistance to the level of 0.7 per cent of\r\ngross domestic product to which developed countries\r\ncommitted themselves in several conferences  the\r\nmost recent of which was the International Conference\r\non Financing for Development, held at Monterrey,\r\nMexico. It is however, African countries themselves\r\nthat will have to overcome the immediate challenges\r\nfacing the African continent.\r\nWithin the United Nations, we are extremely\r\npleased that the decision of the Administrative\r\nCommittee on Coordination not to launch further\r\ninitiatives and to harmonize existing initiatives\r\nconcerning Africa persuaded African leaders to work\r\ntowards establishing the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment.\r\nRecognizing their responsibilities and\r\nacknowledging the roles their Governments should\r\nassume to address these challenges, African leaders\r\nheld a special summit in Sirte, Libya, in 1999 that\r\nadopted the Sirte Declaration on the establishment of\r\nthe African Union and its relevant institutions. At the\r\nLusaka Summit, held in 2001, the African Union was\r\nofficially declared, replacing the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity.\r\nWith renewed determination, the concept of\r\nNEPAD was approved and a mechanism was\r\nestablished to coordinate and harmonize various\r\ninitiatives for Africa. We are optimistic that the\r\ndetermination shown by African leaders to end wars\r\nand conflicts, to establish peace and security and to\r\ninstitute good governance, democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights, as prerequisites for development, are\r\nsigns that the Partnerships objectives will come to\r\nfruition.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency The Honourable\r\nMr. Arjun J.B. Singh, Minister of State for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Nepal.\r\nMr. Singh (Nepal): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating the President on his well-deserved\r\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nAfrica is a rich continent of poor peoples. Nature\r\nhas been generous with Africa. However, poverty has\r\ndecimated its peoples. Hunger, HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis have wasted its populations. Conflicts\r\nhave sapped its strength. Long humiliation and\r\nexploitation have added insult to its injury.\r\nNepal applauds the African peoples as they\r\nengage in the task of redeeming their dignity and\r\nchanging their destiny. We stood with Africa in its fight\r\nagainst colonialism and apartheid. We now stand with\r\nAfrica as it takes a quantum leap towards transforming\r\nits future with the launching of the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD).\r\nNEPAD is Africas ambitious and powerful\r\nresponse to its many challenges. Led, owned and\r\nmanaged by the Africans, the initiative aims to do\r\nmany things: resolve conflicts, strengthen democracy,\r\nensure development and improve governance. This is,\r\nby far, the largest enterprise intended to insure regional\r\npeace and prosperity.\r\nImplementing NEPAD will test the tenacity and\r\nresolve of the African leadership and management. The\r\nneed to involve Governments, businesses and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations will make it a complex\r\noperation. Resource constraints and competing\r\ndemands will require delicate prioritization.\r\nConflicts, hunger, poverty, HIV/AIDS and\r\nmalaria must receive immediate attention to save lives\r\nand to pave the way for durable peace, development\r\nand justice.\r\nThe peer review mechanism is a potent tool to\r\nenforce collective self-discipline. Politically sensitive,\r\nit will require ample doses of guts and candour, as well\r\nas necessary safeguards against its selective use.\r\nBroad-based and effective institutional\r\narrangements will be essential for NEPADs execution.\r\nThe African Union should provide the structural link.\r\nIts own efforts apart, Africa will need\r\nconsiderably more external support to produce the\r\nintended results. Encouragingly, from the Millennium\r\nSummit to the Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nconferences, Africa has received all the right sound\r\nbites. Fulfilment of these pledges is the urgent\r\nimperative.\r\nNepal calls on development partners to exert their\r\npolitical will to meet their commitments on\r\ndevelopment assistance, debt relief, market access and\r\ncapacity-building. Special attention should go to the\r\nleast developed countries. The world owes a debt of\r\nconscience to Africa, both as the cradle of humanity\r\nand as a victim of history.\r\nThe promotion of South-South cooperation will\r\nalso be valuable to raise up Africa. The United Nations\r\nsystem deserves appreciation for its help to Africa by\r\ncarrying out its own programmes and drawing world\r\nattention to the continent. It should redouble its efforts\r\nin both these areas as well as to facilitate South-South\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nWe all share a common humanity and common\r\ndestiny in this global village. Common sense dictates\r\nthat we join forces for peace, prosperity and justice, in\r\nAfrica and around the world. Nepal is willing to work\r\nfor these cherished goals and for NEPADs success.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Ambassador Lee Ho-jin of the Republic of\r\nKorea.\r\nMr. Lee (Republic of Korea): At the outset, I\r\nwish to join previous speakers in highlighting the\r\nimportance of this full days high-level meeting on\r\nAfrican development. The past year has heralded\r\nsignificant structural and political change in the field of\r\nAfrican development with the launching of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD) and\r\nthe transformation of the Organization of African Unity\r\n(OAU) into the African Union (AU).\r\nMy delegation commends NEPAD on its\r\ncommitment to the African countries individual and\r\ncollective ownership of their own development.\r\nNEPAD is now moving from its planning phase into\r\nthe implementation phase, where other initiatives have\r\nfailed to sink sound roots. At this juncture, it is crucial\r\nthat we address the challenges before us and cooperate\r\nin order to find constructive solutions.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nThe foremost challenge to African development is\r\nconflict and civil strife. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGenerals assessment that security must be elevated to\r\nthe highest priority in African affairs and that\r\nNEPADs economic initiatives must be bolstered by\r\nstrong institutions for conflict prevention and\r\nmanagement. As transparency and democracy are\r\nprerequisite to sound economic growth, good\r\ngovernance is another key to the successful\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. In this regard, we\r\ncommend NEPADs peer review mechanism, under\r\nwhich African leaders will hold each other mutually\r\naccountable for enforcing the principles of good\r\ngovernance.\r\nThe cornerstone of NEPAD is the new partnership\r\nbetween the African countries, the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations, as well as among\r\nthemselves. The policy framework of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD) clearly\r\nunderscores the importance of the African countries\r\nownership of their development. Accordingly, at the\r\ncountry level the priorities of NEPAD must be\r\ntranslated from rhetoric into steadfast national policies\r\nand programmes. The African Governments should\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to NEPAD by allocating\r\nthe significant financial resources from their national\r\nbudgets needed for initiating and sustaining the new\r\npartnership programmes.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in NEPAD will be\r\nto support the efforts made by African countries\r\nthemselves. The relevant organs of the United Nations\r\nsystem are obliged to share their substantial knowledge\r\nand experience in these matters with the African\r\ncountries.\r\nIt is important for the United Nations to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive approach that addresses the issues of\r\npeace and security, good governance, poverty\r\neradication and human rights in their support for\r\nNEPAD.\r\nAs emphasized at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development in Johannesburg, the\r\ninternational community should fulfil its commitment\r\nto NEPAD through financial support and assistance in\r\ncapacity building. We welcome an increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance to match the financial\r\ncommitments of the African countries to their national\r\nNEPAD programmes. We would also like to see efforts\r\non the part of the international community to expand\r\nmarket access to African commodities in order to\r\nencourage trade.\r\nThe international community should share its\r\nexperience and expertise in the important area of\r\nhuman resources development with the African\r\ncountries. This cooperation is particularly important in\r\nthe field of information and communications\r\ntechnology (ICT), which has become an indispensable\r\nmeans of distributing the benefits of globalization.\r\nFor its part, the Republic of Korea has made\r\nefforts to share its development experiences and\r\ntechnological expertise with the developing countries.\r\nThe Korean Government has participated in a number\r\nof programmes with particular emphasis on ICT. We\r\nhave helped build regional information and\r\ntelecommunications centres and supported various ICT\r\ntraining projects in Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of Korea would like\r\nto renew its commitment to providing necessary\r\nassistance to the African countries wherever possible.\r\nWe remain confident that the resolute commitment and\r\npolitical will of the African countries, reinforced by an\r\neffective response from the international community,\r\nwill help NEPAD progress.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Gabriel Valdés,\r\nchairman of the delegation of Chile.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): It is a\r\nspecial honour for me to address this special session\r\ndevoted to Africa. Despite geographical distance, Chile\r\nhas been very close to the African continent since the\r\nbeginning of the process of decolonization and later, in\r\nthe bodies created by the United Nations for that\r\npurpose.\r\nEqually, whenever we have been on the Security\r\nCouncil we have focused particularly on the problems\r\nof the African continent, doing everything we could to\r\ncontribute, along with the region and the international\r\ncommunity, in the search for solutions to the problems\r\nand conflicts faced by Africa.\r\nNonetheless, on this occasion we are united for a\r\ndifferent purpose. This new initiative is first and\r\nforemost a proposal from Africans, and should be\r\nunderstood as such.\r\nThe Chilean Government gives major importance\r\nand priority to NEPAD. For this reason we would like\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nto join in the expressions of recognition, support and\r\nencouragement from the international community to\r\nthe African countries on the occasion of this initiative.\r\nThis initiative  from within the continent\r\nitself  is the direct result of the work of institutions\r\nsuch as the African Union. It places the Africa of the\r\ntwenty-first century in a new dimension based on the\r\nrenewed commitment on the part of its Governments to\r\ngenerate their own conditions and enable them to\r\ncreate the well-being of their peoples.\r\nWe are sure that based on NEPADs objectives \r\nincluding economic development aimed at reducing\r\nlevels of poverty by fifty percent by the year 2015 \r\nAfrican countries will receive sustained support from\r\nthe international community to address urgent needs of\r\nthe continent. In this manner, Africa will be granted its\r\nrightful place to benefit from the world economy and\r\nglobalization.\r\nHowever, it will not be possible to achieve\r\nNEPADs objectives without a much-needed opening\r\nof trade with an end to the subsidies that negatively\r\naffect African products. This should be accompanied\r\nby the promotion of exports from the region,\r\nparticularly in agriculture and textiles. In this manner,\r\ngrowth, which will attract the necessary foreign\r\ninvestment will, in its turn, contribute to increased\r\ngrowth.\r\nIt is also a good sign that NEPAD includes in its\r\ndesign a set of initiatives of a regional scope with\r\nimportant continent-wide programmes such as gender\r\nequality, the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria among others.\r\nWe believe that the implementation process of\r\nNEPAD leaves space to explore initiatives leading to\r\nthe broadening of Africas relationship with the\r\ncountries of Latin America, in particular with the Rio\r\nGroup. In this manner regional dialogue will be\r\ngenerated, leading to the formulation of new and\r\ninnovative forms of cooperation and assistance in the\r\nareas of public policy, promotion of trade and other\r\nareas where Latin American experience could be of\r\nuse.\r\nThe Economic Commission for Africa and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean could be charged together to formulate\r\nproposals to take this initiative forward. Even though\r\nChile is a small country on the world stage, it holds a\r\nfirm position  together with other members of the\r\ninternational community  in favour of strengthening\r\nmultilateralism through implementation of joint action\r\nallowing the creation of policies which will help us\r\nestablish a more developed, equitable and safe world.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Ouch Borith, chairman\r\nof the delegation of Cambodia.\r\nMr. Ouch (Cambodia) (spoke in French):\r\nMr. President, may I first offer you my warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I am\r\nconfident that under your wise leadership and guidance\r\nwe will have a productive and successful 57th session\r\nwhich will contribute to solutions for the many issues\r\nconfronting us.\r\nMay I at the outset congratulate the African\r\nGovernments who have launched the New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development, (NEPAD), to eradicate\r\npoverty and to place their countries, both individually\r\nand collectively, on a path of sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment. The adoption of NEPAD, together with\r\nthe birth of the African Union, will undoubtedly give a\r\nstrong impetus to Africa in striving for rapid economic\r\ngrowth and secure its prompt inclusion in the\r\nglobalization process.\r\nWe are meeting today to give our full support to\r\nNEPAD. This session is being held at the same time as\r\nthe final review of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF  1991), adopted by the General\r\nAssembly in 1991.\r\nHowever, NEPAD is unique, in that it was\r\nconceived and developed by Africans for Africans. We\r\nwish to stress that this initiative has a very great chance\r\nof success. Our own experience in Cambodia is that,\r\nwhile we are very grateful to our international partners\r\nfor helping Cambodia move forward, true\r\nreconciliation, peace and development can be achieved\r\nonly if we Cambodians decide to do so ourselves.\r\nWe are very grateful to our African brothers for\r\nthis opportunity to review the plan of action of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD) at the\r\nUnited Nations, so that it can receive the endorsement\r\nof the international community and so that we can\r\nforge a true partnership with Africa for the effective\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nNEPAD seeks to generate new forms of\r\ncooperation between Africa and the developed world. It\r\nseeks genuine partnership between Africa and its\r\nexternal partners, based on mutual accountability.\r\nNEPAD reflects a wide-ranging vision for promoting\r\nbetter governance, ending Africas conflicts and wars,\r\neradicating poverty and placing African countries, both\r\nindividually and collectively, on the path of sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Secretary-Generals report contains specific\r\nproposals on the modalities of future United Nations\r\nengagement with the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment. We welcome such relationships, which\r\nwill take place at the country, regional and global\r\nlevels, and hope that they will be further strengthened.\r\nAt high-level meetings, pledges have been made to\r\nincrease official development assistance, to open up\r\ndeveloped-country markets to the exports of\r\ndeveloping countries, and to reorient the world\r\nfinancial and world trade systems in favour of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nHowever, such pledges have been made before.\r\nNow we need action. The pledges must be fulfilled,\r\nsomething that has been sorely lacking in the past both\r\nworldwide and, especially, for Africa. The objectives\r\nand priorities identified in NEPAD should be seen in\r\nthe context of, inter alia, the goals and targets agreed at\r\nthe Millennium Summit and set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, and at the Monterrey and Doha\r\nconferences, and meetings on the causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Having recently emerged from a\r\nprolonged period of conflict and turmoil, we in\r\nCambodia realize the link between conflict prevention\r\nand the promotion of sustainable development.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for causing the\r\nindependent evaluation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF) to be undertaken by 12 eminent\r\npersonalities, and for reporting on it to the General\r\nAssembly in document A/57/156. We note with\r\ngratification that important progress has been made in\r\nthe implementation of UN-NADAF in the areas of\r\neconomic and political reform, private sector\r\ndevelopment, the strengthening of civil society,\r\neconomic cooperation and regional integration.\r\nHowever, we note that in other areas, such as\r\ncontrolling the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the resolution of\r\nAfricas debt problem, official development assistance\r\nflows, foreign direct investment and other private-\r\nsector flows, market access, agriculture, food security\r\nand the diversification of African commodities, there is\r\na lack of progress in many respects, caused by a lack of\r\nexternal support for UN-NADAF.\r\nWe therefore urge the international community,\r\nespecially the donor countries, to continue aid to Africa\r\nnow by assisting NEPAD, and in fact to step up such\r\nassistance by providing debt relief, increasing the flows\r\nof official development assistance and foreign direct\r\ninvestment, and by providing market access for African\r\nexports. The process of the enhanced Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, aimed at speedy\r\ndebt relief, should be supplemented by other efforts to\r\nfind a permanent debt exit strategy for Africa. The\r\nreport on the review of UN-NADAF also contains\r\nproposals for the modalities of cooperation with\r\nNEPAD. It is always useful to learn from what went\r\nright, while avoiding the mistakes of the past.\r\nI believe that our African brothers, with their high\r\nlevel of determination and their devotion, will certainly\r\ncontribute to the main success in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD for the sake of peace, stability and prosperity\r\nfor all African brothers.\r\nThe President: I recall that the Assembly has\r\nagreed to a time limit of five minutes for all statements\r\nin this debate, and I appeal to all remaining speakers to\r\nrespect that time limit. The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Sorajak Kasemsuvan,\r\nAdvisor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nchairman of the delegation of Thailand.\r\nMr. Kasemsuvan (Thailand): Thailand joins the\r\nrest of the international community in welcoming the\r\nstrong resolve of our African brothers in advancing the\r\nNew Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD),\r\ninitiated in 2001. We also take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our congratulations to all African countries on\r\nlaunching the African Union on 10 July this year.\r\nTodays high-level plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to consider how to support NEPAD\r\nreflects the high importance that countries Members of\r\nthe United Nations attach to Africa and to its efforts to\r\nfind home-grown solutions to political and economic\r\nchallenges. Todays meeting symbolizes the will and\r\ncommitment of the international community to\r\ncooperate with Africa in its effort to overcome the\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\ndifficult conditions that for too long have brought\r\nhardship and frustration to the people of this great\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe international community and various\r\ngroupings, including the Group of Eight (G-8), have\r\nalready recognized the unique character of NEPAD and\r\nits potential for generating effective solutions to the\r\nchallenges faced by Africa. NEPADs vision as an\r\nAfrican-driven process working in partnership with the\r\ninternational community and its emphasis on\r\ndemocracy, development and governance are just two\r\nof the many elements that make NEPAD different from\r\npast initiatives and potentially a more dynamic and\r\ncredible framework within which to produce concrete\r\noutcomes.\r\nWe are pleased to express Thailands support for\r\nNEPAD and our readiness to cooperate more closely\r\nwith our African brethren in realizing the goals and\r\naspirations set forth in the NEPAD framework.\r\nThailand attaches great importance to Africa as\r\npart of our Look West policy, and it welcomes the\r\nrecent positive developments that have taken place in\r\nthe region. We have always looked towards enhancing\r\nour existing relations with African countries and\r\ndeveloping new ones on the basis of mutual benefit.\r\nOur interest in Africa is also reflected in the technical\r\nassistance that we have provided over the years to\r\nseveral African countries in specific areas where we\r\nhave expertise, such as agriculture, HIV/AIDS and\r\npublic health, education and human resources\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNEPAD will add a new dimension and greater\r\ndynamism to our relationship with Africa. One area of\r\ncooperation that can be explored is that of trilateral\r\ncooperation, in which Thailand could provide\r\nappropriate technical assistance in partnership with the\r\ndonor community in specific areas such as HIV/AIDS,\r\npublic health and agriculture to individual African\r\ncountries, based on their needs.\r\nWe hope that specific actions and programmes\r\nunder NEPAD and existing activities and projects\r\nunder other frameworks will complement one another,\r\nand that all initiatives related to Africas development\r\nat the national, subregional, regional and international\r\nlevels will bear fruit and bring lasting peace, social\r\nprogress and greater prosperity to the African people.\r\nBut in the end, the success of NEPAD will\r\ndepend on the political will of the African countries\r\nand of the international community, particularly the\r\ndonor community, to stay the course and to build a\r\nviable and enduring partnership. The potential and\r\npossibilities for NEPAD and the great African\r\ncontinent are enormous. Thailand will play its role\r\nwithin its means and in conjunction with the\r\ninternational community to cooperate with Africa to\r\nhelp realize that potential and those possibilities. In a\r\nglobalized world, where the challenges of one\r\ncontinent are in the end the common challenges of all\r\nmankind, certainly we cannot afford to do any less than\r\nthis.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Felipe Paolillo,\r\nchairman of the delegation of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nUruguay expresses its sincere hope that the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD) will be\r\nthe beginning of a new phase in which the international\r\ncommunity will carry forward the fight against poverty\r\nin Africa with greater efficiency and achieve greater\r\nand more effective results in the promotion of lasting\r\npeace and sustainable development on the continent.\r\nCooperation in Africa, as it has existed so far, has\r\nnot produced results commensurate with the efforts\r\nexpended by the international community or with the\r\nresources thus employed. NEPAD offers new and\r\nencouraging possibilities for eradicating poverty on the\r\ncontinent and for setting the African countries on the\r\npath to growth and sustainable development in order to\r\nput an end to their marginalization in the process of\r\nglobalization.\r\nNEPAD is a specifically African proposal, of\r\nwide scope, encompassing the political and economic\r\ndomains. It will orient the actions of the United\r\nNations and the international community towards\r\ndevelopment priorities in the region, such as those\r\nagreed upon by the Heads of State and Government at\r\nthe 2000 Millennium Summit.\r\nUruguay, which is currently undergoing a very\r\ngrave economic and financial crisis whose solution will\r\nalso require external cooperation, obviously cannot\r\ncommit to ambitious cooperation efforts or contribute\r\neconomic resources to NEPAD. Nevertheless, my\r\ncountry, faithful to its commitment to multilateralism,\r\nwill continue to participate in international cooperation\r\n31\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nactions for development to the extent of its real\r\npossibilities.\r\nIn fact, as it has been doing for 50 years, Uruguay\r\nis involved in many peace operations, convinced that\r\nbuilding lasting peace is crucial to development  in\r\nany region of the world  because peace and security\r\nis closely and indissolubly linked to economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\nOn the African continent, military and police\r\nforces from Uruguay, as well as Uruguayan civilian\r\npersonnel, have been deployed to Rwanda, Liberia,\r\nMozambique, Angola, Sierra Leone and Western\r\nSahara. Our most recent involvement, in which we\r\ncontributed the largest contingents, has, for two years,\r\nbeen in the United Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, to which Uruguay\r\nis the principal contributor, providing 1,500 troops,\r\nmen and women, as well as transport material and\r\nequipment. Our contribution also includes water\r\npurification systems manufactured in Uruguay, which\r\nhave proved to function with complete satisfaction,\r\nthus solving the serious problems in several zones of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo caused by the\r\nshortage or lack of potable water.\r\nWe recently signed with Angola a bilateral\r\ncooperation agreement on agriculture and livestock to\r\noffer to that country technological assistance and\r\ntechnical capacity in areas such as crop farming, the\r\nlivestock and dairy industries, seed production\r\ntechnology, combating plant disease, phyto-sanitary\r\nlegislation, irrigation and water resources.\r\nWe must ensure that the coordinated effort of the\r\ninternational community is matched by a secure flow of\r\nresources in order to guarantee its success, as was\r\nagreed upon by the heads of State and Government in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. We hope that this\r\ninitiative will accomplish the goals set and that we will\r\nbe proud of its achievements.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Djessan Philippe\r\nDjangone-Bi, chairman of the delegation of the Côte\r\ndIvoire.\r\nMr. Djangone-Bi (Côte dIvoire) (spoke in\r\nFrench): It is gratifying to note that, in its rightful\r\nquest for sustainable development, Africa can count on\r\nthe international community. Africa, which contains\r\nthe largest number of developing countries, places\r\ngreat hope in the ensemble of activities and measures\r\nundertaken by the international community to ensure\r\nsustainable development, which Africa needs in order\r\nto escape the vicious circle of poverty.\r\nThe most significant fact in this process of\r\nfighting poverty remains today, without doubt, the\r\ntaking into account of the provisions of the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD). As a\r\nwhole, NEPAD is designed by Africans themselves\r\nwithin the framework of the African Union and takes\r\ninto account their specific situations. It offers a series\r\nof measures to fight poverty effectively in order to\r\npromote the economic, social and human development\r\nof the peoples of Africa. To this end, the Africans place\r\ntheir hope, in particular, on integrated regional\r\ndevelopment supported fundamentally by the private\r\nsector.\r\nNEPAD is an instrument designed, among other\r\nthings, to facilitate North-South partnerships aimed at\r\nthe sustainable development of Africa. It aims to\r\npromote new international investments while\r\nencouraging respect for human rights, good governance\r\nand democracy.\r\nChapter VIII of the Plan of Implementation of the\r\nJohannesburg Summit is devoted to NEPAD, thereby\r\naffirming the international communitys support for it.\r\nCôte dIvoire would also like to welcome the\r\nadoption by the Group of Eight (G-8) at its recent\r\nsummit at Kananaskis, Canada of an Action Plan\r\nserving as the basis for the strengthening of\r\ncooperation and partnership between the G-8 and\r\nAfrica.\r\nCôte dIvoire is also convinced that the effective\r\nand sustained implementation by all parties concerned\r\nof the conclusions and recommendations of the Fourth\r\nMinisterial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization on trade in Doha, of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development in\r\nMonterrey and of the World Summit for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Johannesburg will contribute to\r\nachieving the goals for growth, progress, development,\r\npolitical stability and peace in Africa.\r\nIt is high time that we act because reflection\r\nwithout action is sterile.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Irma Loemban Tobing-\r\nKlein, chairperson of the delegation of Suriname.\r\n32\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nMrs. Loemban Tobing-Klein (Suriname): I am\r\nhere today on behalf of the Government and the\r\npeoples of my country, Suriname, to express, pledge\r\nand celebrate solidarity  solidarity with the\r\nGovernments and the peoples of the African continent,\r\nour sisters and brothers, who  as their leaders stated\r\nduring the general debate  are determined to emerge\r\nfrom poverty, hunger, famine, destructive and deadly\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis\r\nand to focus on infrastructure development, health,\r\neducation, the protection of the environment, new\r\ntechnologies, sound energy policies, access to\r\ndeveloping markets, economic growth and strong\r\npartnerships between Government, civil society and\r\nnon-governmental organizations. They are also\r\ndetermined to build a strong and lasting culture of\r\npeace, democracy, good governance, respect for human\r\nrights and accountability, as the surest and  in many\r\ncases  the most rapid path towards sustainable\r\nhuman development.\r\nSuriname feels a sense of responsibility towards\r\nAfrica and the African people because we share one\r\nhistory. A substantial part of our countrys population\r\nis descended from Africa and our drums still speak the\r\nsame language. Africans have gone to Suriname and\r\nfelt at home, because our cultures resemble each other\r\nso closely. We are happy to accommodate African\r\nfishermen in our country because they share their\r\nknowledge with us, thereby boosting our fishery sector.\r\nWe are also here today as representatives of the\r\nGovernment and the peoples of my country, Suriname,\r\nto congratulate our sisters and brothers from the\r\nAfrican continent and the entire world community, on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD), on the birth of the African Union and on\r\ntheir strong determination to make a commitment to\r\nAfrica, to develop Africa and to prove that Africa can\r\neventually become a true example of political,\r\neconomic and social transformation, on the basis of its\r\nown cultural wealth and its precious natural and human\r\nresources.\r\nWe congratulate Africa on the growing solidarity\r\namong the African leaders and peoples  solidarity\r\nthat was demonstrated in particular during the general\r\ndebate, when we joined long lines of people, many\r\ndressed in beautiful African robes, to express our\r\nfelicitations.\r\nSuriname needs to express its solidarity with\r\nAfrican countries and to support such initiatives as\r\nNEPAD because our countries, wealthy as they are in\r\nnatural resources and human potential, suffer from\r\nsimilar difficulties in terms of economic development\r\nand poverty eradication. We are fighting the same fight\r\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis. We feel the pain of the countries of\r\nAfrica, who see their forests disappearing and their\r\nfertile agricultural lands turning into deserts. We share\r\nthe concern of the many African people who do not\r\nhave access to clean drinking water and reasonable\r\nsanitation. We feel the African peoples grief,\r\nespecially that of older people, women and children,\r\nwho are suffering as a result of wars.\r\nThe support of the international community,\r\nincluding the Bretton Woods institutions and donor\r\ncountries, working in true partnership, and significant\r\ninjections of outside investment are needed in order to\r\nmeet special needs of Africa, as embodied in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals  the basis for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa and the entire world  as stated\r\nso eloquently by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his\r\naddress this morning. The Secretary-General made us\r\nrealize this morning that if there is no economic\r\ndevelopment for Africa, there will not, and cannot, be\r\nsustainable human development for the world.\r\nIt is well known that developing countries cannot\r\nfully meet the needs of their peoples on the basis of\r\ntheir own financial resources. They must be assisted.\r\nWe no longer need lip service; the time has come for\r\nreal action.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annans recent visit to\r\nvarious African countries encouraged and inspired us\r\nto participate in this high-level meeting. Indeed, we\r\nmust take responsibility for one another, especially the\r\npoor, the vulnerable and the oppressed, as fellow\r\nmembers of a single human family, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral said at the opening of the Johannesburg\r\nSummit.\r\nIt is because of the need for support and\r\npartnership that we co-sponsored the draft resolution\r\non the United Nations Declaration on the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development. We should do\r\nmore than pay lip service. We must, therefore, actively\r\ncombine our efforts in order to ensure that African\r\npeople enjoy their right to development  their human\r\n33\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nright to live a life in dignity and respect. We want to\r\nsee Africa prosper.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Milos Alcalay,\r\nchairperson of the delegation of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Alcalay (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nshould like first of all to congratulate you,\r\nMr. President, and to assure you of my delegations full\r\ncooperation and best wishes for success as you\r\ndischarge your responsibility in guiding the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the General Assembly\r\nhas convened this high-level plenary meeting to\r\nconsider how the United Nations system can support\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD). The international community is joining in\r\nthat effort in a spirit of optimism. It is an innovative\r\napproach aimed at achieving objectives of great\r\nimportance for the peace and security of the peoples of\r\nAfrica.\r\nAfrican leaders conceived of NEPAD as a\r\ndynamic common vision, firmly convinced of their\r\nurgent duty to alleviate poverty and lead their\r\ncountries, both individually and collectively, towards\r\nsustainable development, while participating actively\r\nin the global economy and in political decision-making\r\nat the international level.\r\nThe vision is that of a united and strong Africa\r\nthat recognizes the need to develop a partnership\r\nbetween Governments and all elements of civil society,\r\nincluding and involving women, young people and the\r\nprivate sector, as the main actors in achieving those\r\nobjectives and in strengthening solidarity and cohesion.\r\nWe note with enthusiasm the determination of\r\nAfricans to overcome the difficulties and obstacles that\r\nthe continent has been facing in terms of socio-\r\neconomic underdevelopment and exclusion.\r\nNEPAD is a source of inspiration, because it is\r\nbased on the principles and values of democracy, good\r\ngovernance, respect for human rights and the\r\npromotion of peace, security and stability as\r\nprerequisites for the achievement of development and\r\nthe integration of the continent into the world economy.\r\nEven though in the past there have been\r\ninitiatives that targeted the objectives set out so\r\nresolutely by NEPAD today, this new effort to achieve\r\nthe goal of development and overcome the most\r\noppressive problems of the region is substantially\r\ndifferent from past efforts.\r\nWith NEPAD, the Africans themselves are\r\ndesigning the programme, which is to be directed and\r\nadministered by Africans. It promotes partnerships\r\namong Governments, the private sector and civil\r\nsociety in the quest for new forms of cooperation and\r\nin defining interests with the developed world on the\r\nbasis of mutual concerns and benefits. All of this is set\r\nagainst the backdrop of the clear link between\r\ndevelopment and stability and based on the momentum\r\ncreated by the United Nations system to achieve this\r\ngoal with the help of the new methodologies that are\r\nbeing introduced.\r\nAllow me to point out that, as Chairman of the\r\nGroup of 77, I am particularly pleased to be able to\r\nstate that we supported, as an expression of solidarity,\r\nthe Declaration that will be adopted at the end of this\r\nHigh-level Meeting.\r\nVenezuela fervently hopes that this broad-ranging\r\npact to achieve peace, security and stability in the\r\nregion will be successful and that it will serve as an\r\nexample and a source of inspiration to the international\r\ncommunity so that it can address, with respect and with\r\ndue consideration for the African continent, the steps\r\nand reviews that will have to be undertaken in future.\r\nNEPAD should be given an appropriate place\r\nwithin the United Nations, where, through coordinated\r\nefforts, the foundation has been laid for consistent and\r\ncoordinated work among the principal organs, and\r\nwhere various kinds of initiatives and programmes are\r\nunder way that address areas and sectors of priority for\r\nAfrica.\r\nWith international support for the New\r\nPartnership and the systematic implementation of its\r\nprogrammes, the international community will\r\ncontribute to the resolution of the problems and critical\r\nsituations that are confronting the peoples of Africa,\r\nthereby bringing about the peace and security that all\r\nso ardently desire.\r\nNEPAD, together with the African Union  for\r\nwhich the Government of Venezuela also expresses its\r\nsupport and to which it wishes every success  will\r\nprovide sound bases for the achievement of the\r\nproposed objectives. We believe that NEPADs success\r\nwill open possibilities for South-South cooperation and\r\n34\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\ngive rise to creative and promising mechanisms for\r\ncooperation to achieve development objectives.\r\nMy country will continue closely to monitor the\r\ndevelopment of this initiative, as it is convinced that its\r\nmechanisms and programmes will be harmonized in\r\nsuch a way as to build a new reality, in accordance with\r\nthe guiding principles of the Millennium Summit,\r\nwhich were approved by our heads of State.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mahamane Maiga, Adviser\r\nto the Minister for Foreign Affairs and chairman of the\r\ndelegation of Mali.\r\nMr. Maiga (Mali) (spoke in French): The\r\nGeneral Assembly has chosen for this debate the theme\r\nof support for the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). I should like first of all to\r\nunderline the particular importance that my country\r\nattaches to NEPAD, which offers Africa a new\r\nopportunity at a time when that continent is attempting\r\nto begin the third millennium by laying down the bases\r\nfor sustainable development through an innovative\r\napproach.\r\nIndeed, given the backwardness of the continent\r\nin many sectors, of its high level of indebtedness, of\r\nthe conflicts and natural disasters and of the difficult\r\nsituation of its peoples, African political leaders have\r\ntaken the initiative to reverse the trend by elaborating a\r\nplan for development in a new spirit, that is, NEPAD.\r\nThis new vision for a new Africa, which is sustained by\r\na political commitment clearly expressed by African\r\nleaders, in based on partnership between Africa and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nNEPAD defines a strategy for development\r\nfocused on four priority sectors: infrastructures,\r\nagriculture, education and health. Entirely designed by\r\nAfricans in order to improve the living conditions of\r\nAfricans, NEPAD is in reality a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated development plan that deals with Africas\r\nsocial, economic and political priorities.\r\nThe plans objectives are clearly identified and\r\nare centred on the values of democracy, good\r\ngovernance, poverty reduction, the eradication of the\r\nHIV-AIDS pandemic and of malaria, the maintenance\r\nof peace  all of which will make possible the\r\nattainment of the goals of the Millennium Summit\r\nthroughout the African continent.\r\nBy adopting NEPAD, a genuine overall strategic\r\nframework expressing the development choices made\r\nby Africa itself within the framework of the African\r\nUnion, the African continent has made it clear that it\r\nwishes henceforth to be a fully fledged partner in the\r\ninternational community and intends fully to play its\r\nrole in an international context characterized by\r\nglobalization of the economy.\r\nHowever, the efforts made by Africa itself,\r\nhowever relevant they may be, will not produce the\r\nexpected results if they do not benefit from a\r\nfavourable international economic environment and\r\nfrom consistent support from the international\r\ncommunity, as well as from the translation into reality\r\nof the recommendations of the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries,\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the Johannesburg Summit.\r\nIn this respect, the measures taken by the G-8\r\nSummit at Kananaskis represent the first response of\r\nthe G-8 to the process of Africas recovery through\r\nNEPAD. Likewise, we welcome the decision of the\r\nEuropean Union to increase gradually the level of its\r\nofficial development assistance to 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product. We welcome also the decision of the\r\nUnited States Government to increase significantly the\r\nlevel of United States aid to developing countries and\r\nto facilitate access to United States markets, as granted\r\nto African States through the African Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act.\r\nWe express the sincere wish that these generous\r\ninitiatives will be given concrete embodiment in order\r\nto contribute to the achievement of the development\r\nobjectives contained in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nbecause Africas situation requires that special efforts\r\nbe made.\r\nThe parties concerned and Africas partners must\r\nendorse and give their full support to the African\r\ninitiative. The various commitments that they will\r\nundertake in this respect will make it possible for\r\nAfrica to move ahead and to build its future in order\r\nbetter to integrate itself into the world economy and\r\nstrive for the progress of humanity.\r\nIndeed, the efforts of African States require a\r\nfavourable international environment, which implies\r\nadequate and better-distributed flows of foreign\r\ndirect investment in those countries. Development\r\nrequirements must also be better taken into account in\r\n35\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nthe World Trade Organizations work programmes. A\r\nsubstantial increase will be required in official\r\ndevelopment assistance, concrete measures for debt\r\nalleviation will need to be taken, and the global\r\ninternational monetary, financial and trade system will\r\nneed to be harmonized and strengthened.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that we must work\r\ntogether to support the political will and the realism\r\nshown by African Governments in their decision to\r\nundertake robust economic and political reforms in\r\norder to give fresh hope to the men and women of\r\nAfrica, who are determined to shoulder their share of\r\nthe responsibility for the development of the continent.\r\nIn this respect, NEPAD represents an opportunity\r\nfor Africa, in the throes of its rebirth, to take up the\r\nchallenges of globalization and of integration into the\r\nworld economy.\r\nMali fervently hopes that this session will make it\r\npossible to lay the foundation for finding solutions to\r\nAfricas problems, which are also the problems of the\r\nworld as a whole. Mali will also contribute to the\r\ndebates to come on this subject, in particular the final\r\nreview and appraisal of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in 1990s.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Hasmy Agam, the\r\nchairman of the delegation of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): Malaysia congratulates\r\nthe leaders and peoples of Africa for their initiative on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nWe view NEPAD as a bold effort to halt the\r\nmarginalization of Africa from the process of\r\nglobalization and integration in the world economy.\r\nNEPAD is a reflection of the commitment of African\r\nleaders and their partners to building a strong and\r\nenduring culture of democracy, respect for human\r\nrights and sustained economic growth. It enhances the\r\nsense of realism and urgency required for this task to\r\nprovide Africa with a unifying and home-grown\r\nframework for the future development of the continent.\r\nIt represents a determined effort by Africa to take its\r\ndestiny in its own hands, in partnership with the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration emphasized the\r\ninternational imperative of addressing the special needs\r\nof Africa. We therefore urge the international\r\ncommunity to fully support the NEPAD initiative by\r\nassisting Africans in their efforts to eradicate poverty\r\nand to achieve sustainable development. The\r\ninternational community should, as a matter of\r\nurgency, give its strong support to emerging\r\ndemocracies in Africa, to encouraging regional and\r\nsubregional mechanisms for preventing conflict and\r\npromoting political stability and to ensuring a reliable\r\nflow of resources for peacekeeping operations.\r\nPoverty eradication is an indispensable\r\nrequirement for sustainable development. Malaysia\r\nbelieves that, more than anywhere else, Africa requires\r\nthat the poverty reduction goal agreed to in the\r\nMillennium Declaration be achieved. Malaysia will\r\ncontinue to play a modest role in enhancing\r\ncooperation with African countries through our training\r\nprogramme. We will continue to exchange views with\r\nour African partners on enhancing our cooperation and\r\npartnership programmes, including through the\r\nLangkawi International Dialogue.\r\nIn the context of South-South cooperation,\r\nMalaysia will continue to encourage its private sector\r\nto take an active role in promoting closer economic ties\r\nwith African countries for mutual benefit. We hope that\r\nthis can be pursued through the creation of a conducive\r\nenvironment based on the smart partnership approach\r\ninvolving Governments, the private sector and civil\r\nsociety.\r\nGiven the many challenges in the implementation\r\nof the World Food Summit goal of halving the number\r\nof undernourished people by the year 2015, it is\r\nimperative that the current trends towards\r\ndesertification and land degradation be arrested and\r\nreversed through the necessary financial assistance and\r\ntransfer of technology. We urge the international\r\nfinancial institutions and the Global Environment\r\nFacility (GEF) to substantially increase the financing\r\nof the agricultural sector and for the full\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Convention to\r\nCombat Desertification and other relevant\r\nConventions.\r\nThe test of any initiative lies in its\r\nimplementation. The lack of follow-up action and the\r\nnecessary means of implementation have been major\r\nlimiting factors in the realization of previous initiatives\r\nin support of Africa. For Africa to achieve the\r\nMillennium poverty reduction target alone, an annual\r\nresource gap estimated at over $60 billion has to be\r\n36\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nbridged. Collective efforts must be made to mobilize\r\nthe much-needed resources, both domestically and\r\ninternationally, particularly through human resources\r\ndevelopment, diversification of Africas production and\r\nexports, increase in the level of official development\r\nassistance, debt relief, private capital flows and\r\nimproved infrastructure. We believe that building\r\ninfrastructure is a necessary precondition for sustained\r\neconomic growth. Given the constraints facing African\r\ncountries, we urge the United Nations system and the\r\ninternational community, in particular donor countries,\r\nto assist in Africas infrastructural development and to\r\nhelp achieve the full implementation of NEPAD.\r\nA safe and secure world cannot be achieved if\r\nAfrica, an integral and important part of the whole,\r\ncontinues to be mired in poverty and destitution. The\r\nNEPAD initiative is a serious and determined effort on\r\nthe part of the African leaders and their peoples to\r\nchart their own future. The international community\r\nmust play its role and show its full support for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD if Africa is to realize its\r\npotential and the promise of a more humane and stable\r\nworld for all.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser,\r\nchairman of the delegation of Mexico.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe holding of this plenary session is an explicit\r\nrecognition of the fact that the development of Africa\r\nis a shared responsibility of the entire community of\r\nnations. It is also recognition of the fact that our efforts\r\nshould focus on the priority tasks and programmes\r\ndefined by the countries of Africa themselves.\r\nIt is Africans who are masters of their own\r\ndestiny, and it is up to them to lay down their path.\r\nThis is why Mexico welcomes the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD) as a vision of the new\r\ndemocratic African leaders, as the fruit of a new\r\ncollective will to strive for transparency and the rule of\r\nlaw and as an expansion of the intention of all Africans\r\nto work together.\r\nNEPAD is the awaited signal for the international\r\ncommunity, without excuse or delay, to mobilize to\r\nmeet all its longstanding commitments. Nothing that\r\nwe have done thus far has yielded the results we had\r\nhoped for. In spite of the adoption of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s, the gross domestic product (GDP) fell far\r\nbelow target, and the social situation continues to be\r\ndisquieting. There are many causes for this failure; it is\r\nup to us to remedy it.\r\nWith NEPAD, we now have an instrument, a\r\nstrategy and a cause. It is up to the African countries to\r\nprovide it with substance, to promote democracy and\r\nfulfil the explicit proposal to work together. That is\r\nwhy we welcome the creation of the African Union. It\r\nis necessary for the members of this Assembly and the\r\nUnited Nations to establish the necessary\r\ncomplementary resources and investments in order to\r\nprovide access to markets, technology and knowledge.\r\nThe difference between success and failure for NEPAD\r\nlies precisely in the quality, scope and continuity of the\r\nstrategic association that we are able to establish for it.\r\nBy this, I mean a strategic association between all the\r\nbodies of this Assembly and between the United\r\nNations agencies; a strategic association with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and a strategic association\r\nwith Governments, companies, universities, civil\r\nsociety and the mass media.\r\nIn this framework for action, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council Special Ad Hoc Advisory Committee\r\non African Countries emerging from conflict situations,\r\nas well as the Special Working Group on the\r\nPrevention and Solution of Conflicts in Africa, created\r\nby the Security Council, are designing support\r\nmeasures for Africa, the implementation of which will\r\nbe undertaken with the coordinated participation of all\r\nUnited Nations bodies. Mexico joins in this cause.\r\nBecause of their origin, magnitude and consequences,\r\nthe problems of Africa are our problems, faced by all\r\nof us. The international community is undoubtedly\r\nindebted to Africa.\r\nThe success of the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) will be essential for the\r\nbuilding of a new international architecture. Africas\r\ndevelopment and inclusion, based on a new foundation\r\nfor the process of globalization, depend to a great\r\nextent on humanity being capable of facing the greatest\r\nchallenges and making use of the opportunities of our\r\ntimes.\r\nAfrica is where we should test our will to prevent\r\nwars and to achieve just and lasting peace\r\narrangements in which the deep-rooted causes of\r\nconflict can be addressed. It is on this continent where\r\nwe should demonstrate our collective will to effectively\r\ncombat HIV/AIDS, reintegrate refugees and displaced\r\n37\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\npersons into a dignified and productive life, insure that\r\nhuman rights be respected, protect the environment,\r\nmake sustainable use of natural resources, lower infant\r\nmortality, respect the rights of minorities and fully\r\ninvolve women in collective efforts to achieve\r\nprosperity and development.\r\nThe International Conference Financing for\r\nDevelopment at Monterrey, the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development in Johannesburg, the FAO\r\nconference on food in Rome, and the meeting of the\r\nGroup of Eight Industrialized Countries (G-8) in\r\nCanada are forums that gave rise to commitments made\r\nearlier this year, to insure that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) would become a reality in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision\r\ntaken earlier this morning at the 10th plenary meeting I\r\nnow call on the President of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, His Excellency Mr. Ivan imonović.\r\nMr. imonović (President of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council): I am honoured to participate, on\r\nbehalf of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)\r\nat the plenary debate on NEPAD. The Council\r\nwelcomes the opportunity to make a contribution to the\r\ndebate on Africa, whose sustainable development\r\nremains a high priority for its members.\r\nI am pleased to say that the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil was among the first, if not the first, to\r\nwelcome both the launching of the African Union and\r\nthis very important Africa-designed and Africa-owned\r\ninitiative at its high-level segment, which was held a\r\nfew days after the OAU Summit in Lusaka last year.\r\nIndeed, last year the Council devoted its high-\r\nlevel segment to the theme The role of the United\r\nNations in support of African countries to achieve\r\nsustainable development.\r\nA number of important messages emerged from\r\nthat meeting which are important both for the final\r\nreview and appraisal of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF) and for the plenary debate on NEPAD.\r\nThere was a strong consensus that there should be no\r\nnew initiatives for Africa, but that the United Nations\r\nsystem should provide an effective, coordinated\r\nresponse to the initiative, utilizing it as the framework\r\nfor support of the region.\r\nThere was also general agreement on the critical\r\nimportance of peace, democracy and good governance\r\nas the foundation for sustainable development in Africa\r\nand the need for a comprehensive, integrated approach\r\nto peace and development at national and subregional\r\nlevels.\r\nNowhere does Africa need the assistance of the\r\ninternational community more than in the area of\r\nconflict prevention and peace-building. I am pleased to\r\nsay that on 15 July 2002 the Council established an ad\r\nhoc advisory group on African countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict. The group will be small and flexible and\r\nwill provide advice to the Council on how to ensure\r\nthat the assistance of the international community in\r\nsupport of the country concerned is adequate, coherent,\r\nwell coordinated and effective. The Council will use its\r\ncoordinating function to promote, in a practical way,\r\nsystem-wide efforts to address the economic, social and\r\nhumanitarian dimensions of post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding as well as to mobilize needed attention and\r\nresources for individual countries.\r\nAs I announced at the conclusion of this years\r\nsubstantive session, Guinea-Bissau requested the\r\ncreation of an ad hoc advisory group, which the\r\nCouncil will be considering shortly.\r\nLet me use this opportunity to draw attention to\r\nsome disturbing trends. There is growing evidence that\r\nmost African countries, especially the least developed,\r\nwill not be able to achieve several of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, largely because of the\r\nlack of adequate financial resources, weak institutional\r\ncapacities to implement the action plans required to\r\nmeet the goals, the devastating consequences of\r\nHIV/AIDS, and, in some countries, conflict.\r\nIn its follow-up to the International Conference\r\non Financing for Development at Monterrey, the\r\nCouncil, which has been given the important\r\nresponsibility for follow-up, will work with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions to ensure that the issues of debt,\r\nmarket access, official development assistance and\r\nforeign direct investment, which are of such critical\r\nimportance for Africas economic recovery, are\r\nmeaningfully addressed.\r\nI am glad to inform you that Africa featured\r\nstrongly in this years high-level segment of ECOSOC,\r\nwhich had as its theme, the contribution of human\r\nresources development, in particular health and\r\neducation, to the process of development. Two high-\r\n38\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nlevel panels were held on the status of Africa with\r\nrelation to the human resources aspects of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) in general,\r\nand the health-related MDGs in particular. Strong\r\nconcern was expressed that, following current trends,\r\nthe majority of African countries will not achieve these\r\ngoals. In its ministerial communiqué, the Council\r\noffered strong support for NEPAD to achieve, inter\r\nalia, its human resources development objectives.\r\nLet me conclude. I assure you that the Council\r\nstands by its commitment made at its high-level\r\nsegment of 2001 that it will do whatever is required to\r\nensure the sustainable development of Africa. On its\r\nbehalf, I urge Africas partners to renew the\r\ncommitment we made at last years high-level segment\r\nto Africas sustainable development.\r\nI look forward to working with the African\r\nUnion, its subregional organizations and its members\r\nin this respect.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 2011 (XX) of 11 October 1965\r\nand Assembly decision 56/475 of 15 August 2002, I\r\nnow call on the Interim Chairman of the Commission\r\nof the African Union and former President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Amara Essy.\r\nMr. Essy (African Union) (spoke in French):\r\nFrom 27 May to 1 June 1986 the General Assembly\r\ndevoted a special session to Africa and adopted a\r\ndecision on the United Nations Programme of Action\r\nfor African Economic Recovery and Development\r\n1986-1990 (UNPAAERD). Sixteen years later, the\r\nAssembly is also devoting a special session to Africa\r\nand more particularly to NEPAD. Therefore, in my\r\ncapacity as Interim President of the African Union, I\r\nwould like to thank the members of the General\r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General for this show of\r\nconcern towards Africa.\r\nUNPAAERD offered some hope for Africa. But\r\nthe commitments were not kept, the programme failed\r\nand a new programme, the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF) was adopted by the General Assembly.\r\nThe report of the Panel says that a lack of commitment\r\non the part of the main agents of development was one\r\nof the reasons for the non-implementation of the New\r\nAgenda.\r\nSince that time, what have we seen? Of the 49\r\nleast developed countries, 35 are in Africa. There are 5\r\nmillion refugees and 15 million displaced persons, and\r\nhalf of its people live on less than one dollar a day.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan has reported that since\r\n1996 half of all the worlds deaths occur in Africa.\r\nWhat can we do today?\r\nAfrica knows poverty. It is a rich continent with\r\npoor people. I think it is these past failures that led\r\nheads of State to design the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD), which is a\r\nprogramme adopted by the African Union  initially\r\nin Lusaka, when it was known as the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity.\r\nNEPAD is the result of all that we have learned\r\nfrom all the failures. I will not discuss it here in any\r\ngreat detail. As the saying goes, When the head is\r\navailable, you do not wear a hat on your knees.\r\nPresident Obasanjo, President Wade and President\r\nMubarak, among others, have all explained the key\r\nfeatures of NEPAD. I think everybody understands it. It\r\nwas explained in Paris, in Dakar and in Kananaskis. We\r\nhave explained it everywhere; it was just the subject of\r\na meeting in the Trusteeship Council Chamber.\r\nI think that today NEPAD is the hope of the\r\nAfrican Union. Without its success, there will be no\r\nsuccess for the African Union. The two things are\r\nintimately linked. We are aware that Africa has learned\r\nall the lessons from past failures. The new Partnership\r\nis based on a new concept. Africa is not begging\r\nanymore. Africa has examined the situation. And\r\nAfrica knows what it has to do. After 40 years of\r\nindependence we have grown to adulthood. I think we\r\nall know that God helps those who help themselves.\r\nAfrica wants to help itself, and Africa is waiting for the\r\ninternational assistance it needs to ensure its own\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs everyone knows, Africa is a very rich\r\ncontinent. We know that in this globalized world there\r\ncannot be oases of prosperity in a desert of poverty.\r\nThe success of NEPAD will not only be a success for\r\nAfrica, but a success for the entire international\r\ncommunity. Africa needs to be built. And we are sure\r\nthat the success of Africa today is a success that can be\r\ncompared with that of Europe. Europe experienced the\r\nHundred-Year Wars and the Thirty-Year War. The\r\nMarshall plan enabled Europe to develop. I am certain\r\ntoday that the African Union will be able to play its\r\n39\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nrole today. Our hope is that the promises made in\r\nforums worldwide will be kept, and that tomorrow we\r\nwill have an African Union which is well-established\r\nand capable of making its contribution to world peace.\r\nThat is our hope; I thank all participants for their kind\r\nwords about the African Union.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 3208 (XXIX) of 11 October 1974,\r\nI now call on His Excellency Mr. John Richardson,\r\nchairman of the observer delegation of the European\r\nCommunity.\r\nMr. Richardson (European Community): As\r\nalready stated by Denmark on behalf of the European\r\nUnion (EU), from the very beginning the European\r\nUnion has expressed its full support for the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD) which\r\nwe see as a truly African platform not just for\r\neconomic and social progress, but also for political\r\nempowerment. The European Commission endorses\r\nand supports the political values that are at the heart of\r\nNEPAD, which in the EUs view correspond to\r\nindispensable components of an effective development\r\npolicy: good governance, democracy, respect for\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. It is our strong belief\r\nthat these elements are indispensable preconditions for\r\nthe sustainable development of the continent and for\r\nthe creation of an environment more conducive to\r\npeace and stability.\r\nWe believe also that the formation of the African\r\nUnion and the implementation of NEPAD can be\r\nmutually reinforcing in propelling the continent\r\nforward. The decision taken in Durban in July to set up\r\na Peace and Security Council and an African standby\r\nforce is evidence of the level of ambitions existing in\r\nAfrica in this regard.\r\nNEPAD and the African Union have one\r\nimportant characteristic in common: they aim at\r\ncreating a pan-African level of governance. By its very\r\nnature, the European Commission understands and\r\nendorses the common vision and values that will guide\r\nthis new pan-African level of governance, for those\r\nvalues are the same as those that guided and inspired\r\nthe founding fathers of the European Union in shaping\r\nthe European integration process, considered the most\r\nsuccessful example of an ever closer union among\r\nsovereign States.\r\nThe European Commission very much\r\nappreciates the new dimension of African ownership\r\nand leadership expressed through the African Union\r\nand NEPAD, and the evident African determination to\r\nbuild a more coherent framework for tackling key\r\nchallenges such as peace, stability and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe new pan-African level of governance holds\r\ngreat development potential. Engaging civil society and\r\nthe private sector in a participatory process will be\r\ncrucial in this new dynamic. The strengthened\r\neconomic and political environment and the increased\r\nintegration of the African economies can act, we\r\nbelieve, as a catalyst for better and accelerated\r\nmobilization of all development resources, inside and\r\noutside, and for increased synergy between different\r\nnational programmes of neighbouring countries.\r\nThe European Unions cooperation with Africa\r\ntakes place through the contractual instruments of the\r\nBarcelona Mediterranean-European Development\r\nAgreement, the Cotonou Partnership Agreement and\r\nThe EU-South Africa Trade, Development and\r\nCooperation Agreement, which we have negotiated\r\nwith African countries. The Commission is ready to\r\nsupport NEPAD itself as a process, and we are\r\nprepared to assess and reassess our own programmes in\r\nAfrica in the light of NEPAD, and to step up our\r\nsupport for regional and continental integration.\r\nNEPAD and the African Union are likely to play\r\nan important part in the next stage of the dialogue\r\nbetween the EU and Africa. The second Europe-Africa\r\nministerial conference, to be held in Ouagadougou in\r\nNovember 2002, and the next EU-Africa summit, to be\r\nheld in Lisbon in April 2003, represent occasions to\r\ngive new political momentum to the Europe-Africa\r\ndialogue, which we began in Cairo two years ago.\r\nNEPAD is an important new opportunity in the context\r\nof the EU-Africa partnership. We in the EU intend to\r\nseize it with our African partners.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 33/18 of 10 November 1978 and\r\ndecision 53/453 of 18 December 1998, I now call on\r\nthe Permanent Observer for the International\r\nOrganization of La Francophonie, Mr. Ridha Bouabid.\r\nMr. Bouabid (International Organization of La\r\nFrancophonie) (spoke in French): The New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development (NEPAD) is the culmination\r\nof a series of African development initiatives,\r\nincluding the Lagos Plan of Action and the African\r\nalternative framework for structural adjustment. It also\r\n40\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\naims to be a break and a new start, a break for the sake\r\nof a new approach and a new start for the sustainable\r\nrebirth of Africa. In Lusaka, in July 2001, when this\r\nnew African initiative was approved by heads of State\r\nor Government of Africa, we in the Francophone\r\ncommunity had the feeling that this was a great\r\nmoment in the history of the African continent, a\r\nmoment without precedent, a moment highly symbolic\r\nof the new face of Africa, of the hopes it nourishes for\r\nitself and of the ambition it is cultivating for its\r\npeoples.\r\nNow we have before us a programme of action\r\nbased on a strategic new vision. It is a programme\r\nconceived, designed, developed and managed by Africa\r\nitself, taking into account all the realities of the\r\ncontinent. In it, African leaders recognize their primary\r\nresponsibility on the issue and formally commit\r\nthemselves to taking whatever action is required to put\r\nAfrica on the path of growth and development and to\r\nintegrate Africa into the world economy.\r\nThe international community must assist that\r\neffort with equal commitment, in particular regarding\r\nthe problems over which Africa has little control. I am\r\nthinking especially of the problems of financing, debt\r\nand market access.\r\nBy affirming the interdependence of peace,\r\ndemocracy and development and by establishing\r\nstability, good governance and respect for the rule of\r\nlaw as the prior conditions for development, the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD)\r\ninspires our respect and deserves our support.\r\nIn this context, we welcome the establishment of\r\nthe peer review mechanism intended to ensure that the\r\npolicies and practices of the States parties are\r\nconsistent with the values enshrined in the Declaration\r\non democracy, political, economic and corporate\r\ngovernance.\r\nThe International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie, whose membership includes 29 African\r\ncountries, welcomed this initiative from the outset and\r\ndecided to extend to it its support. We made proposals\r\nto that end at the Summit of African Heads of State on\r\nthe financing of NEPAD, held in Dakar last April.\r\nSome of our proposals are the result of observed\r\nconvergences between the priorities chosen by NEPAD\r\nand the priority areas of action of la Francophonie.\r\nThey mainly fall into the following areas.\r\nWith respect to peace, security and good\r\ngovernance, we offer NEPAD our processes and\r\nprogrammes, in particular, those issuing from the\r\nBamako Declaration, adopted by the francophone\r\ncountries in November 2000, with special emphasis on\r\nthe strengthening of institutional capacity by taking\r\nadvantage of professional networks and existing\r\ninstruments. We and our NEPAD partners carried out a\r\nprocess of reflection in the course of two specific\r\nmeetings, one held in Dakar last April parallel to the\r\nAfrica Summit and the other, more recently, in Paris on\r\n19 and 20 June, 2002, in order to refine the proposals\r\nand to define the specific modalities of la\r\nFrancophonies activities with regard to this\r\nfundamental aspect of NEPAD.\r\nWith respect to the acquisition of new\r\ninformation and communication technologies, in\r\naddition to the programmes currently being carried out\r\nby the Francophone Institute for New Information and\r\nTraining Technologies, which greatly benefit our\r\nAfrican member countries and which harmonize with\r\nNEPAD objectives, a ministerial conference of la\r\nFrancophonie on the information society will be held in\r\n2003 in preparation for the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society to be held in Geneva in 2003 and\r\nin Tunis in 2005. The work of that conference will give\r\nla Francophonies activities in that field an orientation\r\nthat is even more supportive of NEPAD.\r\nThe issues of energy and the environment have\r\nbeen amply covered by the work we carried out in\r\npreparation for the recent Johannesburg World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development. Our chosen framework\r\nfor action with respect to those issues, which will guide\r\nour relevant programming over the next 10 years, was\r\nin large part inspired by the concerns and guidelines\r\nformulated in NEPAD.\r\nLastly, education and culture are two areas in\r\nwhich la Francophonie possesses recognized\r\nexperience. Its programmes for Africa are designed and\r\ncarried out in close cooperation with the Ministries of\r\nEducation, particularly those of Africa. Needless to\r\nsay, they are in line with the priorities chosen by\r\nNEPAD.\r\nTo conclude, I would add that the solidarity of the\r\nfrancophone countries with Africa will hold a\r\nprominent place on the agenda of the Summit of Heads\r\nof State and Government of Countries Using French as\r\na Common Language, to be held in Beirut, Lebanon in\r\n41\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\na few weeks. NEPAD will, indeed, be at the centre of\r\nthe discussions on economic issues at the Summit.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on NEPAD.\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Thabo\r\nMbeki, President of the Republic of South Africa, to\r\npresent orally a summary of the discussions in the\r\ninformal panel and also to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.2/Rev.1.\r\nPresident Mbeki (South Africa): I am pleased to\r\npresent this brief report on the informal panel\r\ndiscussion on the theme the international communitys\r\npartnership with the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which was held this\r\nafternoon in parallel with the high-level plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on the New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development.\r\nLet me thank the many participants, including\r\nheads of State and Government, ministers, heads of\r\ndelegations and ambassadors, as well as heads and\r\nrepresentatives of the agencies and organizations of the\r\nUnited Nations system and of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions. In particular, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation to my fellow panellists, President\r\nObasanjo of Nigeria, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of\r\nAlgeria, President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal, and\r\nMr. Ahmed Maher El Sayed, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Egypt, who represented His Excellency\r\nPresident Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. The panel was ably\r\nmoderated by Mr. Mark Malloch Brown, chairman of\r\nthe United Nations Development Group.\r\nThe interactive discussion following the\r\npresentations by the panellists was wide-ranging and\r\nshowed the considerable and continuing international\r\ncommitment to NEPAD. Representatives of Member\r\nStates reaffirmed the support of their Governments for\r\nthe implementation of NEPAD by committing\r\nresources and taking various other actions, including\r\ndebt reduction, increasing official development\r\nassistance and providing market access for African\r\ngoods and services. However, they stressed the need\r\nfor good governance, accountability, transparency and\r\nthe rule of law in African countries. They underlined\r\nthat good governance was critical to attracting\r\ninvestment. They also stressed the need to move ahead\r\nwith the implementation of NEPAD, and they called for\r\nbroader international partnership in support of that\r\neffort. In that regard, the Group of Eight Africa Action\r\nPlan was cited as an example of the response of the\r\ninternational community for the implementation of\r\nNEPAD.\r\nThe need to engage with international financial\r\ninstitutions and the importance of African ownership in\r\nthe successful implementation of NEPAD were also\r\nstressed. In addition, the need to deepen African\r\nownership through the involvement of civil society,\r\nparliamentarians, academia and the private sector was\r\nemphasized. It was recognized that African civil\r\nsociety lacked the capacity, in many instances, to\r\nactively engage itself in the debate on the NEPAD\r\nprocess. In that regard, the international community\r\nwas called upon to help in building capacity inside the\r\ncivil society. It was also noted that African\r\nGovernments themselves need further reinforcements\r\nwith regard to building up capacity in various areas.\r\nThe agencies and organizations of the United\r\nNations system expressed strong support for NEPAD.\r\nThey underlined the fact that they have organized their\r\nactivities in Africa to respond directly to the priorities\r\nof NEPAD. They highlighted the wide range of\r\nactivities that their agencies had undertaken in support\r\nof NEPAD, and they pledged to use existing United\r\nNations coordinating mechanisms, especially at the\r\ncountry level, to support that effort. To enhance the\r\nimpact of the United Nations agencies in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, they agreed that there\r\nshould be greater collaboration among themselves, but\r\nalso that much larger resources are required to make\r\nsure that Africa meets its challenges.\r\nThat is a brief summary of the report of this\r\nafternoons very successful interaction.\r\nIt remains for me to introduce document\r\nA/57/L.2/Rev.1, the draft United Nations declaration\r\non the New Partnership for Africas Development,\r\nwhich is sponsored by more than 145 countries. It\r\nbroadly embodies the spirit of support for NEPAD, as\r\nreflected in the debate at the plenary meeting today.\r\nTherefore, I commend the draft declaration for\r\nconsideration and adoption by the General Assembly.\r\nFinally, I should like to express our deep\r\nappreciation for the decision of the General Assembly\r\nto hold todays high-level plenary meeting on NEPAD,\r\nand also to thank the President of the Assembly, the\r\nMember States and the Secretary-General for having\r\nparticipated in this important meeting.\r\n42\r\nA/57/PV.11\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/57/L.2/Rev.1, entitled\r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development.\r\nBefore proceeding to take action on the draft\r\nresolution, I should like to announce that since the\r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become co-sponsors of A/57/L.2/Rev.1:\r\nAlbania, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh,\r\nBarbados, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Burundi,\r\nCanada, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros,\r\nCongo, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic\r\nPeoples Republic of Korea, Denmark, Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Eritrea, Fiji, Finland,\r\nFrance, Gabon, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Hungary,\r\nIceland, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Lao\r\nPeoples Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Lesotho,\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, Luxembourg, Malawi,\r\nMalaysia, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mozambique,\r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Oman,\r\nPakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea,\r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, San Marino,\r\nSaudi Arabia, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore,\r\nSlovenia, Somalia, Spain, Sudan, Swaziland, Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia, Togo, Tonga, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine,\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, United States of\r\nAmerica, Uruguay, Viet Nam, Yemen, Yugoslavia,\r\nZambia and Zimbabwe.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.2/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/57/L.2/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 57/2).\r\nThe President: The high-level plenary meeting\r\nof the General Assembly to consider how to support\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development is now\r\nconcluded.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n"
