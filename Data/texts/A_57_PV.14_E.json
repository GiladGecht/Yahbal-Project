(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nThe Honourable Rialuth Serge Vohor, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and External\r\nTrade of the Republic of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Vohor (Vanuatu): In addressing this\r\nhonourable Assembly, I first wish to convey the\r\ngreetings of the people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Our\r\nfuture will be determined by the nations represented\r\nhere today.\r\nI also take this opportunity to congratulate you,\r\nSir, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly. You have\r\nassumed the presidency during a turbulent period in\r\ninternational relations, and my delegation pledges its\r\nfull support and cooperation to you, as you guide this\r\nnoble Organization through this difficult time. I also\r\ntake this opportunity to acknowledge with deep\r\ngratitude the contributions of your predecessor, who so\r\ncompetently steered the work of the fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly to its conclusion.\r\nI acknowledge with much gratitude and\r\nadmiration the outstanding leadership and diplomatic\r\nskills of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His\r\noutstanding wisdom has made it possible for the United\r\nNations to maintain its credibility and relevance not\r\nonly in maintaining international peace throughout the\r\nworld, but also in ensuring that this Organization\r\ncontinues to address the development challenges\r\nconfronting the world, including Vanuatu.\r\nI am pleased to welcome the Swiss Confederation\r\nas a Member of the United Nations. I am looking\r\nforward to the imminent admission of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, a nation where Vanuatu was\r\nhonoured to have participated in the United Nations-\r\nadministered peacekeeping process.\r\nThe deeply disturbing events of 11 September\r\nwill remain etched in our memories for a long time. On\r\nbehalf of the Government and people of Vanuatu,\r\nI have the solemn duty of conveying to the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States of\r\nAmerica, including the families of the innocent victims\r\nof 11 September 2001, our sincere condolences for the\r\nmany innocent lives lost on that fatal day of the most\r\ninhuman act of modern history. The barbaric and\r\ncowardly acts of 11 September have shaken the\r\nfoundations and principles on which this Organization\r\nis built. They have ushered in a new period of global\r\nuncertainty.\r\nTerrorism has become the scourge of our time.\r\nThis complex phenomenon has scarred our planet. As\r\nresponsible members of the international community,\r\nwe must work closely together in order to eradicate it.\r\nHowever, any action of reprisal or punitive measures\r\nmust receive universal support through established\r\nmultilateral and international structures, beginning\r\nwith the United Nations, the most universally\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nrepresented organization. It is very dangerous to take\r\nany action outside such mechanisms. We request that\r\nall actions undertaken must, above all, serve the\r\npurpose of guaranteeing justice, peace and security in\r\nthe future world.\r\nIn particular, we call upon the initiators of a\r\nmilitary action against Iraq to show great wisdom and\r\nresponsibility to ensure that their decisions do not\r\ncreate a new world order of insecurity, hatred and\r\nconflict, defined by cultural, ethnic and religious\r\ndivisions. All actions taken must be consistent with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nand established international law.\r\nAlthough the fight against terrorism has taken\r\ncentre stage, it must not lead us to forget or to neglect\r\ndevelopment issues and security concerns inherent to\r\nthe developing world, in particular, to the small island\r\nStates. Some resources will inevitably be reallocated to\r\nthe growing problem of security, but it must not\r\novershadow the development agenda of the developing\r\nworld. It is in that context that my delegation wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statements made by other\r\nPacific island countries in endorsing the Pacific Islands\r\nForum declarations that have been distributed as a\r\nUnited Nations document.\r\nThe recent World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment held in South Africa unambiguously\r\nreminded us that much remains to be done in\r\naddressing the challenges inherent to the world’s many\r\ndeveloping economies. The environment and the\r\nnegative impact of climate change are of extreme\r\nconcern, and we urge those countries that have not yet\r\ndone so to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as\r\npossible. The ratifications of Japan, the European\r\nUnion, China and Russia have been most welcome.\r\nThe aggressive policies of developed countries\r\ncontinue to marginalize many of the world’s very small\r\ndeveloping economies, such as that of Vanuatu.\r\nBinding commitments to international declarations and\r\nlegislation are the cornerstone of a peaceful and just\r\nworld in which justice prevails above all. There must\r\nbe equitable partnerships and cooperation so that we\r\ncan all contribute our support and confidence.\r\nWhile small nations, such as Vanuatu, are being\r\nforced to comply with conditions imposed by\r\ndeveloped countries, some of those same nations\r\ndecide at the same time to impose policies that\r\nencroach upon national and regional positions.\r\nVanuatu is firmly opposed to the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons in all their forms. In that context, my\r\nGovernment once more unreservedly condemns the\r\nongoing transfer of radioactive materials in the Pacific\r\nOcean. The flagrant disregard for national and regional\r\nopposition is a clear demonstration of the policies of\r\nthe powerful. That negligence is shameful in the light\r\nof the many ideals and principles espoused by this\r\nOrganization and its various entities. Given the recent\r\nadoption of the Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy\r\nat the Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in the Republic of\r\nthe Fiji Islands, I strongly call on the shipping States to\r\nrespect the efforts of the Pacific Island countries to\r\nsafeguard their principal resource: the sea.\r\nThe conditions imposed by the powerful with\r\nrespect to the initiatives of the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are\r\nanother clear demonstration of the game of the\r\npowerful, in which we see the big nations manipulating\r\nthe world order to their own advantage. Those\r\nabominable policies affect the very boundaries of\r\nnational sovereignty for the benefit of the developed\r\ncountries. We must put an end to all this hypocrisy, if\r\nwe, the small nations, are to be treated fairly and as\r\nequal partners in the international community.\r\nVanuatu opposes discriminatory policies and\r\nlegislation which expose our vulnerability to a very\r\nvolatile global environment. Some of our national\r\nefforts to stimulate economic growth are being stifled\r\nby the enormous pressure exerted by the club of the\r\nrich, which does everything to ensure that their\r\nposition prevails. Where does that leave us? I must\r\nstress this because Vanuatu has done its best to comply\r\nwith the OECD initiatives, including through\r\nlegislation to prevent money-laundering and to ensure\r\ntransparency in financial transactions. Yet, that rich and\r\ninfluential organization continues to put forward\r\nfurther demands. We are ready to negotiate within a\r\ntime-frame that must first suit our economic and\r\npolitical requirements. But the OECD must, in turn, be\r\nready and able to provide immediate relief and\r\nsolutions. Any decision by the OECD to blacklist\r\ncountries such as Vanuatu is premature and\r\nunwarranted. It would serve the interests of the OECD\r\nalone. Vanuatu is confronted with a dilemma because\r\nthe countries that introduced the tax-haven policy\r\nduring the colonial period continue to place\r\nunreasonable demands on our already weak economy.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nOn that note, I must also mention the complicated\r\nand extreme difficulties that my country is facing as it\r\nstruggles through its reform process. Given the\r\nestablished millennium priorities, there is still an acute\r\nshortage of financial assistance necessary to effectively\r\nimplement national development priorities. We have\r\nbecome accustomed to receiving plenty of foreign\r\nadvice that is, unfortunately, not backed up by real\r\nfinancial support. That has placed an extreme burden\r\non the already scarce resources available in the\r\ncountry. I believe that it is important that our\r\ndevelopment partners try to better understand the\r\nparticularities and unique characteristics of not only\r\nVanuatu but also other small and fragile economies of\r\nthe Pacific islands.\r\nThe existing ban on exports of kava to Europe\r\nand the United States is another indication of the unfair\r\nand discriminatory policies practised by the powerful\r\nnations. We expect that other countries will, in turn,\r\njoin the ban. However, there is no scientific evidence to\r\njustify those trade sanctions, which have impacted\r\nnegatively on the economy of Vanuatu. We therefore\r\nseek the support and understanding of the international\r\ncommunity in order to allow time for the adequate\r\nscientific research to be carried out before such trade\r\nrestrictions are imposed. Kava products exported to\r\nEurope and other destinations are mixed with non-kava\r\nproducts. For the moment, it is completely unfair and\r\ndiscriminatory to impose such a ban.\r\nMy Government fully supports the efforts to\r\nreform the United Nations system in order to create a\r\nstronger and more efficient organization. On this issue,\r\nmy delegation endorses the position of other\r\ndelegations on the need to restructure the membership\r\nof the Security Council so that it may better reflect the\r\ngeographical representation and the under-represented\r\ngroups of Member States without affecting the\r\nCouncil’s authority.\r\nThe question of Taiwan must also be adequately\r\naddressed here. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly in 1971, resolved the legal and\r\npolitical representation of the People’s Republic of\r\nChina as a Member of the United Nations. Therefore,\r\nany attempt by Taiwan to gain admission to the United\r\nNations or to any of its affiliated organs or special\r\nagencies will not be supported by my Government. The\r\nUnited Nations must ensure that it does not become\r\ninvolved in the conflict between China and Taiwan,\r\nwhich is a matter totally within China’s purview.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nmention the problem of West Papua. At the Millennium\r\nSummit, the then-Prime Minister of Vanuatu touched\r\non the important matter of the principle of self-\r\ndetermination for the people of West Papua. The\r\nquestion of West Papua has always occupied a special\r\nplace on Vanuatu’s foreign policy agenda. The Charter\r\nof the United Nations espouses the principles that\r\ncontinue to guide the Organization’s efforts with regard\r\nto self-determination. We are completely convinced\r\nthat, if the United Nations is to be consistent in its\r\ndecisions to promote recognition and respect of the\r\nfundamental right to self-determination, the question of\r\nWest Papua must be placed on the agenda of the\r\nSpecial Committee on the Situation with regard to the\r\nImplementation of the Declaration on the Granting of\r\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The\r\nclosed-door policy with regard to the pleas of West\r\nPapuans continues to undermine the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations in terms of its ability to address an\r\nessential matter. I think it is in the best interests of the\r\ninternational community that the question of West\r\nPapua be revisited. We also request that a commission\r\nof inquiry be deployed to verify information on\r\natrocities alleged to have been committed in West\r\nPapua.\r\nIn conclusion, we must continue to support the\r\npivotal role of the United Nations in efforts to create a\r\njust and equitable world. We must stem the growing\r\ngap between the developed and developing worlds in\r\norder to guarantee economic and social prosperity for\r\nall — a critical prerequisite to guaranteeing political\r\nstability, peace and security throughout the world. The\r\neffective implementation of the United Nations agenda\r\nfor development, in particular the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nDeclarations, will advance that process. A more\r\nfavourable international environment will assist the\r\ndevelopmental priorities of developing countries and\r\nwill address the great economic imbalances prevailing\r\ntoday. True goodwill, respect, tolerance and equality\r\nwill be necessary if we are to move forward. The role\r\nof the United Nations will be crucial in that process,\r\nbut only if support is forthcoming from its Members.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Sudan.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I should like to express my sincere\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\ncongratulations, Mr. President, on your election to\r\npreside over the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are fully confident that your renowned\r\ndiplomatic experience will lead to the success of this\r\nimportant session’s deliberations and to the adoption of\r\nresolutions and recommendations that are proportionate\r\nto the current international challenges. I should be\r\nremiss if I failed to express my appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his tireless efforts\r\nto revitalize the role of the General Assembly. I should\r\nalso like to express, on behalf of the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan, sincere congratulations to\r\nthe people and the Government of Switzerland on its\r\naccession to the Organization. In addition, I wish to\r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate, on behalf of the\r\npeople and the Government of the Sudan, the State of\r\nEast Timor on its coming admission as a Member of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nA full year has passed since the deplorable\r\nterrorist events of 11 September, which terrified this\r\ncity, site of the Organization’s Headquarters, where the\r\nflags of all our countries fly and where we meet to\r\ndeliberate on peace, security and justice. The\r\nanniversary of the World Trade Center tragedy is an\r\noccasion to strengthen international solidarity and\r\nresolve to combat terrorism, prompting us to reaffirm\r\nour conviction that terrorism is an elusive enemy that\r\nknows no religion, ethnicity or homeland. It is a\r\nchallenge that should be met with a collective\r\ninternational effort. The war on terrorism should be\r\nwaged with close national, regional and international\r\ncooperation and coordination, in conformity with the\r\nprinciples of international law and under the umbrella\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe Sudan, while reiterating its commitment to,\r\nparticipation in and support for the international\r\ncampaign against terrorism, would like to draw the\r\nattention of the international community to the feelings\r\nof anxiety expressed in various parts of the world at the\r\nderailment of the campaign, whose path and objectives\r\nare no longer on target, and at its manipulation by the\r\nforces of extremism and advocates of confrontation\r\namong civilizations and cultures.\r\nThe situation in the Arab and Islamic world in\r\ngeneral, and in the Middle East in particular, reflects\r\nthat anxiety and those feelings. Therefore, we in the\r\nSudan, current Chair of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, reaffirm our rejection and denunciation of\r\nthat derailment and urge that the international\r\ncampaign against terrorism comply with the rules of\r\ninternational law. We strongly support the call of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt, for\r\nthe convening of an international conference on\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization, submitted to the current session,\r\nreflects the desire of the world’s countries to strengthen\r\ncooperation, to alleviate poverty, to eliminate the debt\r\nburden and to resolve conflicts in order to create a\r\nworld of justice and equality, free of grievances,\r\ninjustice, hatred, bigotry, double standards,\r\nconspiracies and politicization, which run counter to\r\nthe noble objectives of protecting and enhancing\r\nhuman rights. Sudan reaffirms its firm conviction that\r\nthe United Nations remains the ideal mechanism for\r\nachieving international cooperation. Therefore, Sudan\r\nreaffirms its readiness to cooperate fully in all areas\r\nwith United Nations organs. Based on its conviction,\r\nSudan calls for the revitalization of all United Nations\r\norgans and urges that top priority be accorded the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly in that\r\nregard.\r\nDuring the past year, Sudan’s relations with the\r\nUnited Nations made great progress, a progress\r\ncrowned by the important and successful visit of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan to Khartoum. The visit\r\nwas a good opportunity for him to see our country’s\r\npositive development in all fields. The visit\r\nstrengthened the cooperation between the Sudan and\r\nthe international Organization. This year has also seen\r\nvisits to the Sudan by the Directors-General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\r\n(UNIDO), the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Intellectual\r\nProperty Organization (WIPO). The Sudan is\r\nmaintaining good channels of communication and\r\ncoordination with the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies through cooperation, on the basis\r\nof the fundamental principles of its foreign policy,\r\nincluding the principle of openness at the regional and\r\ninternational levels, and in consonance with its strong\r\ncommitment to active participation in all activities\r\naimed at carrying out the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe United Nations Charter calls for the\r\nimportant peaceful resolution of disputes and\r\nemphasizes the important role of regional organizations\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\ntherein. The Sudan is currently presiding over two\r\nregional organizations, the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). In some\r\ncountries of these two organizations there are conflicts\r\nthat are the subject of much thought in the world today.\r\nIGAD is endeavouring to resolve the conflicts in\r\nSomalia and the Sudan. Through the OIC, whose\r\nmembership includes Pakistan, Iraq, Palestine and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, among 57 other countries\r\nforming almost one third of the General Assembly, we\r\nare sparing no effort to find solutions to serious\r\nconflicts at the national and regional levels.\r\nWithout resolving the root causes of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict, by ending the occupation,\r\nimplementing lawful international resolutions,\r\nrestoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,\r\nincluding its right to establish an independent state\r\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, peace, security\r\nand stability will not be achieved in this volatile region\r\nof the world.\r\nWe would like to stress the importance of a\r\npolitical settlement of the dispute between Iraq and the\r\nUnited Nations. In this regard, we would like to spare\r\nIraq and the region the risk of yet another war. As\r\nChairman of the OIC, the Sudan has initiated contacts\r\nwith the United Nations Secretary-General, the Foreign\r\nMinisters of the five permanent Security Council\r\nmembers and the Foreign Minister of Iraq; these efforts\r\nwere crowned with the unconditional acceptance by\r\nIraq of the return of the inspectors. We commend the\r\nbrave decision of the Iraqi leadership to allow the\r\nreturn of the United Nations inspectors and hope that\r\nthis will lead to the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq\r\nand the consolidation of its security, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity so as to enable it to regain its active\r\nrole both regionally and internationally.\r\nThe birth of the African Union last year was a\r\ngreat African event, which renewed the aspirations and\r\nhopes of the continent for total liberation from the\r\nnightmare of conflict, poverty and underdevelopment\r\nin order to achieve solidarity, unity, security and\r\ncomprehensive sustainable development there. We look\r\nforward to working closely with the new international\r\norganization, the African Union, through the\r\nmechanisms established, such as its Peace and Security\r\nCouncil, so that we can coordinate the advancement of\r\nour continent through effective bilateral cooperation\r\nbetween the countries and effective regional\r\ncooperation with economic groupings and partnerships.\r\nIn this connection, the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) has emerged as\r\ntestimony to the ability of the continent to initiate and\r\ncoordinate initiatives among African countries. It also\r\nreflects the sincere desire of the continent for\r\ncooperation through this initiative, with its clearly\r\nstated socio-economic priorities. The various regions\r\nof the continent have also determined their priorities in\r\nthe fields of infrastructure, energy, environment,\r\ncommunications, education, health and primary care. I\r\ncall upon the international community to support\r\nAfrica through this new partnership so that it will attain\r\nits aspirations. We also call on Africa to speak with one\r\nvoice regarding the follow-up and implementation of\r\nNEPAD through the mechanisms of the African Union,\r\nour collective organization.\r\nWith regard to developments in my country, I\r\nhave the honour to inform you of the latest endeavours\r\nto resolve the conflict in southern Sudan. I would recall\r\nthat my Government has always considered the issue of\r\npeace and ending the war in the southern part of the\r\ncountry a priority and a strategic objective. This stems\r\nfrom our conviction that national peace leads to\r\nregional peace, which in turn leads to international\r\npeace, to which we all aspire. My country has spared\r\nno effort to find a solution to the root causes of the\r\nconflict. To that end, we have organized national\r\nconferences and meetings, and we have also responded\r\npositively to the various regional and international\r\nefforts aimed at ending the conflict. Against this\r\nbackground, and under the auspices of an IGAD\r\ninitiative led by Kenya and the efforts of\r\nintermediaries, the Government and the Rebel\r\nMovement have signed on 20 July of this year the\r\nMachakos framework agreement. This agreement was\r\nwidely acknowledged as a step towards eventual peace,\r\nsupported both inside and outside the country.\r\nHowever, the rebel movement has set that progress\r\nback with its insistence on military activities and on re-\r\nopening issues already agreed upon during the first\r\nround of talks. This regrettable development forced the\r\nGovernment to suspend the negotiations.\r\nMy Government believes that it is meaningless to\r\ncontinue military activities after signing the peace\r\nprotocol. My Government will continue to fulfil its\r\nresponsibility for protecting our territorial integrity and\r\nnational security and for seeking solutions to the dire\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nhumanitarian situation of our citizens affected by the\r\nmilitary activities of the rebels, as well as its\r\nresponsibility to secure peace and stability for all\r\ncitizens.\r\nWhile I am setting out the important political and\r\nconstitutional developments in my country, let me\r\nstress my Government’s policy of consolidating\r\ndemocracy and promoting human rights in Sudan,\r\nparticularly after the positive steps taken in the areas of\r\npolitical freedom and freedom of the press. This course\r\nof action opened the door wide for the participation of\r\nall our citizens at the national level.\r\nSudan’s foreign policy with regard to\r\ninternational and regional organizations has been\r\nguided by a clear vision based on well-defined\r\nprinciples — namely, openness towards others,\r\neffective participation in all international and regional\r\nforums and constructive dialogue based on objectivity\r\nand transparency. Inspired by these positions of\r\nprinciple, Sudan looks forward to playing a\r\nconstructive role on issues of regional cooperation in\r\nAfrica and among its neighbours. Sudan is well\r\nqualified to play such a role because of its unique\r\ngeopolitical situation and its human and natural\r\nresources. With this policy, Sudan’s relations with its\r\nAfrican and Arab neighbours have witnessed\r\nsuccessful breakthroughs in economic cooperation,\r\nmutual trade and strategic partnerships.\r\nThe same applies to our interaction with the\r\nUnited States, which is now entering its third year. The\r\nAmerican-Sudanese relationship has witnessed some\r\npositive developments and our relations, which were\r\nruptured, have progressed to the point where the United\r\nStates is fully involved in efforts aimed at reaching a\r\npeaceful settlement in the Sudan.\r\nWe are fully cognizant of the political and\r\neconomic weight of the United States, as well as its\r\neffective role in all regional and international issues.\r\nAs such, we are keen to further enhance balanced\r\nrelations with the United States. Armed with faith in\r\nour just position with regard to the pending issues\r\nbetween the two countries, we remain confident that\r\nour relations with the United States will progress in the\r\nnear future and will be characterized by cooperation, as\r\nlong as both sides continue to remain committed to a\r\npolicy of dialogue rather than confrontation.\r\nWe are also confident that an in-depth dialogue\r\nwill lead us to consolidate trust between the two\r\ncountries in a manner that will spare us the bitterness\r\nof the past. The unfortunate case of the Al-Shifa\r\npharmaceutical plant, which was falsely alleged to\r\nproduce chemical weapons, bears witness to the\r\nsignificance of such a confidence-building process.\r\nThe end of the twentieth century witnessed many\r\nwars and conflicts that preoccupied the international\r\ncommunity. The negative impact of globalization\r\ncontinues to widen the gap between the countries of the\r\nNorth and the South. Although considerable progress\r\nhas been achieved in international cooperation thanks\r\nto qualitative improvements at the United Nations and\r\nthe commendable role played by its Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, some issues and challenges continue\r\nto preoccupy the conscience of the international\r\ncommunity. For this reason the reform process of the\r\nUnited Nations, especially as regards the Security\r\nCouncil, remains imperative.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Indonesia, His Excellency\r\nMr. Hassan Wirayuda.\r\nMr. Wirayuda (Indonesia): On behalf of the\r\nIndonesian delegation, I am pleased to congratulate\r\nyou on your election as President of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are sure that with\r\nyour wise and skilful guidance our deliberations will be\r\nfruitful.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to extend\r\nIndonesia’s warm welcome and congratulations to the\r\nnewest Member of this world Organization —\r\nSwitzerland. We look forward to extending a similar\r\nwelcome to East Timor when it joins our Organization\r\nin the days ahead.\r\nIn November 2001, from this same podium, I\r\nasserted that in order to wage an effective struggle\r\nagainst the multiple threats and challenges confronting\r\nhumankind, we must imbue ourselves with the\r\ndemocratic spirit. Without that spirit, we can only fail.\r\nIn the relations and interactions among nations,\r\nthe democratic spirit is put into practice through\r\nmultilateralism. Multilateralism exists when a group of\r\nnations adopts a set of goals and each individual\r\nmember is equally responsible for the achievement of\r\nthose goals. It entails respect for one another’s\r\nsensitivities and points of view, and therefore requires\r\ndiscussion and the forging of consensus. For the value\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nof each nation, no matter how small or how poor, is\r\nequal to that of any other.\r\nTo my mind, the ultimate form of multilateralism\r\nis a United Nations with a General Assembly already\r\nrevitalized, a Security Council that is truly\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations membership, and a\r\nstreamlined Secretariat that is responsive to the needs\r\nand interests of all Member States.\r\nNowhere is the necessity for multilateralism more\r\nglaring than in our response to the scourge of our time:\r\ninternational terrorism. And nowhere else is the role of\r\nthe United Nations more vital.\r\nThe 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in this\r\ncity and in Washington were not only an attack against\r\nthe United States but also an attack against civilization\r\nand all human values. Therefore, the coalition that\r\nresponded to these attacks had to represent all of\r\nhumanity — all nations, religions and cultures.\r\nFor those reasons the United Nations was actively\r\ninvolved in the response to the attacks and must\r\nmaintain a pivotal role in the response of the world\r\ncommunity to the persistent threat of international\r\nterrorism; otherwise, in the long run, that endeavour\r\nwill fail.\r\nThe same is true of our efforts to advance the\r\ndisarmament agenda, which is also imperative. Until\r\nthe States concerned rid themselves of their arsenals of\r\nmass destruction — whether nuclear, biological or\r\nchemical — the danger remains that much, if not all of\r\nthe human race, could be wiped out in a single\r\nholocaust.\r\nIn accordance with the multilateral principle of\r\nequality, States should no longer cling to the privileges\r\nderived from military superiority over others.\r\nMultilateral affirmative action can also bring\r\nabout peace, where for many years there has only been\r\nviolence and bloodshed. In the Middle East, the Powers\r\nthat wield great influence on the region are called upon\r\nto adopt a just and balanced approach to the issue of\r\nPalestine. They can, if they wish, persuade Israel to\r\nwithdraw its forces from the occupied territories and to\r\ncease settlement activities in accordance with the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nThat will help pave the way for the realization of\r\ntwo States, Palestine and Israel, living side by side\r\nwithin secure internationally recognized borders. Only\r\nthen will peace have a real chance.\r\nIn this context we note with interest the\r\ncommuniqué issued yesterday by the Quartet on the\r\nMiddle East outlining a roadmap to realize such a\r\nvision.\r\nElsewhere, it is important to recall that the\r\nsituation in Iraq has been an issue that has occupied the\r\nSecurity Council for some time. Hence, while over the\r\npast weeks we have witnessed an intensification of the\r\ninternational focus on this issue, we must not lose sight\r\nof the fact that mechanisms already exist within the\r\nUnited Nations system to address the issue. In tackling\r\nthe present challenge, Indonesia deems it necessary\r\nthat peaceful efforts be fully exhausted and existing\r\nUnited Nations mechanisms be fully utilized, and, if\r\nneed be, strengthened.\r\nAny unilateral use of force risks not only\r\nundermining the authority of the United Nations, but\r\nwould also carry the grave potential of destabilizing the\r\nimmediate region, and indeed beyond, with its\r\nattendant humanitarian implications.\r\nFor its part, Iraq must fully comply with the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We are\r\nencouraged by the recent decision by the Government\r\nof Iraq to allow the return of United Nations inspectors.\r\nWe trust that this will pave the way to a peaceful\r\nsolution of the problem and preclude any attack against\r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.\r\nThe situation in Iraq cannot be viewed in\r\nisolation. How we address this problem will have\r\nrepercussions on the longer-standing issue of Palestine\r\nand the challenge of terrorism.\r\nIn Afghanistan, the United Nations has done\r\ncommendable work in helping the Afghan parties\r\nmanage the post-Taliban transition. The international\r\ncommunity must now help the Afghan people in\r\nnation-building, rehabilitating the country’s\r\ninfrastructure and strengthening its newborn\r\nGovernment.\r\nIn the long run, the war against terrorism can only\r\nbe won if we emerge victorious in a more basic\r\nstruggle — the one against poverty. The substantial\r\neradication of poverty, in fact, is what the development\r\ngoals of the Millennium Declaration all boil down to.\r\nAs reported by the Secretary-General, the world\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\ncommunity has made some progress in this endeavour,\r\nwith East Asia recording the most significant gains.\r\nWe still have a long way to go, however, before\r\nwe can meet the goal of reducing by one half, between\r\n1990 and 2015, the number of people living on less\r\nthan a dollar a day.\r\nIf the Millennium goals will be met at all, a major\r\nfactor will be the achievement of an international trade\r\nregime where unilateral practices and protectionism\r\nhave given way to genuine multilateralism. Hence, we\r\ntrust that the forthcoming negotiations mandated by the\r\nFourth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\r\nConference at Doha last year will make possible the\r\nfull integration of developing countries into the\r\nmultilateral trading system. Much also depends on\r\nwhether the pledges made in Monterrey at the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment could be fulfilled and then exceeded.\r\nEarlier this month, the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development reached agreement on a\r\nglobal programme to reduce poverty and restore the\r\nintegrity of our planet and formulated a blueprint for\r\nswitching to a more efficient use of carbon fuels and\r\nrenewable sources of energy. Despite the lack of a\r\ntimetable, the fact remains that we have an action-\r\noriented plan of implementation to be carried out by a\r\nglobal partnership of governments, private business\r\nand civil society.\r\nA factor that can work against our hopes is a\r\nunilateralist trend so apparent at the global level. In the\r\nface of that trend, it becomes even more necessary and\r\ndesirable that regional organizations grow in strength\r\nand share some of the burden that is now borne by the\r\nUnited Nations. This role was envisioned for them\r\neven when the world organization was still being\r\nestablished more than fifty-seven years ago.\r\nIn general, regional organizations strictly adhere\r\nto a multilateral regime, and at that level many global\r\nproblems are so much more manageable. It may\r\ntherefore be highly advisable to find ways and means\r\nof further promoting the natural synergy between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. A good\r\nexample is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN), of which Indonesia is a founding member.\r\nFor many years now, we in ASEAN have been working\r\nwith United Nations bodies to the considerable benefit\r\nof our peoples. It is in this spirit that we, the ASEAN\r\ncountries, are sponsoring a resolution in the General\r\nAssembly on strengthening the working relationship\r\nbetween our regional organization and the United\r\nNations system.\r\nLong before the 11 September attacks, a regional\r\nprogramme to combat terrorism and other transnational\r\ncrimes was an integral part of our ASEAN functional\r\ncooperation. In the face of the surge of this global\r\nthreat, ASEAN has set in motion a work plan to\r\nimplement the 2001 ASEAN Declaration on Terrorism\r\nand Transnational Crime.\r\n We believe, however, that it is the totality of\r\nASEAN’s work that will decisively overcome not only\r\nterrorism but also the basic problem of poverty in our\r\nregion. Since it was founded in 1967, ASEAN has\r\ntirelessly promoted political, economic and social\r\ndevelopment cooperation among its members. The\r\nresult has been three decades of relative peace and\r\nunprecedented economic growth, interrupted only by\r\nthe Asian financial crisis of 1997. To forestall the\r\nrecurrence of such a devastating crisis, we have taken\r\nbold steps toward regional integration. Through this\r\napproach, we hope to achieve our vision of an ASEAN\r\nthat is at peace within itself and with others, an\r\nASEAN that is technologically competitive with the\r\nrest of the world and, through sustainable development,\r\nhas reached, for our part of the world, the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nFrom the time of its inception, ASEAN has been\r\nmuch criticized for its preoccupation with consultations\r\nand consensus-building, which seem to delay action\r\nwhen swift action is needed. I am not troubled by this\r\ncriticism because I regard it as an affirmation of\r\nASEAN’s adherence to the multilateral ethos.\r\nMultilateralism gives ASEAN coherence, commitment\r\nand perseverance in the pursuit of its goals. That is\r\nwhy it has been an effective catalyst for the promotion\r\nof security and economic cooperation in the Asia-\r\nPacific region.\r\nAt the national level, Indonesia has been similarly\r\ndoubted: it is said that reform legislation has been\r\nlagging because of dithering and interminable debate.\r\nMoreover, in some international circles, Indonesia has\r\nbeen portrayed as less than fully enthusiastic in the\r\nglobal fight against terror on the basis of a mistaken\r\nperception that it is lenient with radical Muslim groups.\r\nAnd yet, after all the necessary debates, we did\r\ntake large strides toward further democratization. Our\r\nparliament recently endorsed several amendments to\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nour Constitution: the adoption of a system of direct\r\npopular election of the President and Vice-President,\r\nthe adoption of a bicameral system of legislature, and\r\nthe abolition by 2004 of the 38 seats reserved for the\r\nmilitary and police in the legislature.\r\nA proposal for the adoption of the Shariah or\r\nMuslim law in our legal system did not obtain support.\r\nThe proponents graciously and democratically accepted\r\nthis reality and bowed to the decision of the people’s\r\nrepresentatives and to the force of public opinion. This\r\nreflects our common commitment to democracy.\r\nWe will adhere to the democratic process even in\r\naddressing serious threats to our national security, such\r\nas the separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh\r\nand Papua and the disruptive communal strife in the\r\nprovinces of Maluku. On Aceh, we are prepared to\r\nresume negotiations with the Free Aceh Movement,\r\nprovided the Movement drop its separatist demand,\r\ncease resorting to terrorist tactics and accept the law on\r\nspecial autonomy as a final political solution to the\r\nproblem. At the same time, we shall continue to\r\nprovide protection to civilians from terrorist attacks\r\nthat disrupt public order and cause much suffering.\r\nWe have also applied special autonomy to the\r\nprovince of Papua, which guarantees protection of the\r\ncultural rights of the people, a just and equitable share\r\nof the resources for development, and redress of\r\nlegitimate grievances. In the provinces of Maluku and\r\nNorth Maluku, communal strife has greatly abated with\r\nthe signing of two peace agreements between the\r\nfactions and the holding of reconciliation dialogues.\r\nThe main task now is to build goodwill among the\r\ncommunities and help thousands of internally displaced\r\npersons return home and start a new life.\r\nIn many of our endeavours at political, economic\r\nand social reform, we have been supported by United\r\nNations organizations, funds and programmes. We are\r\ntherefore deeply grateful to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis intention to enhance United Nations efforts to assist\r\nIndonesia in promoting good governance and in\r\nestablishing a stable, democratic and prosperous\r\nsociety.\r\nThus at the national level, we have committed\r\nourselves to the processes of dialogue, wide\r\nparticipation and accountability, which are all inherent\r\nin a democracy, just as we stand for multilateralism in\r\ninternational affairs. We are committed to promote and\r\nprotect the individual rights of our citizens, just as we\r\nhave always advocated that every nation, no matter\r\nhow small or powerless, must have a voice in\r\ninternational affairs.\r\nAt the same time, however, we affirm that\r\ndemocracy is not merely the breaking of chains and the\r\nenjoyment of rights. Whoever would truly be free must\r\nbind himself to the duties and obligations that match\r\nand give meaning to his rights. Every individual has\r\nresponsibilities to the community that nurtures him,\r\njust as every nation has responsibilities to the\r\ncommunity of humankind, including the responsibility\r\nto respect the views of all other members of that\r\ncommunity. This is the fundamental meaning of\r\nmultilateralism.\r\nIn the ultimate analysis, this is all we need to\r\naddress the challenges of our time and make a more\r\npeaceful, more just and more prosperous world: that we\r\nall be sincerely responsible to one another, for one\r\nanother and for the planet that is our only home in this\r\nlife.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Israel, His Excellency Mr. Shimon Peres.\r\nMr. Peres (Israel): I would like to congratulate\r\nmy friend Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly and to wish him\r\nsuccess. I also thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nleadership and his dedication to right what is wrong\r\nand to light the lamps of hope.\r\nThe eleventh of September gave rise to a new\r\nworld. We find ourselves facing a new confrontation:\r\nborderless, merciless, indiscriminate and inhumane.\r\nThe target this time was the United States — a United\r\nStates that in the past helped so many nations defend\r\ntheir freedoms and their liberty. Now the United States\r\nhas been challenged again to defend our freedom by\r\nprotecting its own and to safeguard our lives by\r\nsecuring its own.\r\nThe attack on the World Trade Center precipitated\r\na new division in our epoch and in the years to come —\r\na divide created by groups that preach and cause death\r\nand agony. On the wrong side of the divide are those\r\nwho are trying to destroy the free world, which is\r\ndiversified and heterogeneous, cherishing the right to\r\nevery thought and religion as well as the principle that\r\nevery human being has the right to be different and yet\r\nto prosper and live in security.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nThe front from Bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is a\r\nmenace to us all. It will not enable peace, nor will it\r\npermit freedom — for all people or for their own\r\npeople. In countries that harbour terror, women are\r\ndiscriminated against, men are oppressed, civil and\r\nhuman rights are violated, and the poor cannot escape\r\nfrom their poverty They force us to defend our\r\ninalienable right to look ahead with hope. They\r\nimposed on us a war of self-defence — the defence of\r\npluralism and of the promise of science. They reject the\r\nincredible technologies that may carry us from the\r\nlimits of land to the discovery of uncharted provinces.\r\nThe culture of death forces us to defend the culture of\r\nlife, to win battles that we did not initiate, to triumph in\r\nthis uninvited war.\r\nWe never imagined that it could be dangerous to\r\nwalk our streets, to fly our skies, to breathe the air or to\r\ndrink the water. We cannot agree to this. We cannot\r\nallow dark forces — which, as we are aware, could\r\ndestroy the lives of innocent people on a whim — to\r\npossess weapons of mass destruction. We shall not turn\r\nour lives into a series of sleepless nights and\r\nnightmarish days.\r\nWe do not have the right to ignore the danger. We\r\ndo not have the option to postpone it; it is imminent.\r\nWe have to win as soon as possible.\r\nTerror is destined to lose. It will be defeated\r\nbecause it carries no hope. It respects neither human\r\nbeings nor the values of humanity.\r\nScience and technology made the economy\r\nglobal, and science and technology globalized terror as\r\nwell. Now strategy also is globalized, because ballistic\r\nranges have replaced geographic distances, because\r\nnon-conventional warheads have replaced measurable\r\nexplosives, because terrorism transcends frontiers and\r\nfronts. Terrorists do not respect the rule of law. They\r\ndo not answer to independent judges or relate to\r\nelected leaders. They mock international lines. They\r\ndestroy universal norms. They shed blood. They\r\nintroduced dullness and stopped affluence. Nothing is\r\nto be expected from them but death.\r\nTerror creates poverty more than poverty creates\r\nterror. Terror leads to backwardness. We have to offer\r\nthe economic potential to open prospects and horizons\r\nfor all nations, poor and rich. New opportunities can\r\nbring enfranchisement. We have to close ranks to\r\nprevent distorted dreams from becoming a raging\r\ntyphoon that reaches all four corners of the globe. We\r\nhave experienced in our own country the terrible\r\neffects of terrorism.\r\nBabies were shot in the arms of their mothers.\r\nPeople at prayer were killed while praying. Yes, it hurt\r\nus, but it did not change our goals. We mourn, but we\r\ndid not bury peace.\r\nIt harmed the Palestinians in the United States\r\nand in other countries. It prevented the occupation\r\nfrom ending. It introduced additional problems and did\r\nnot solve a single existing problem.\r\nAlas, the Middle East is still replete with\r\nnational, religious and territorial disputes. The land is\r\nsmall; the agony is great. But the real tragedy is that\r\nwithout terror we could already have resolved these\r\ndisputes. Terror entrenched them. Terror changed\r\npriorities — security before policy. It affected\r\nresources — arming young men, for example, instead\r\nof desalinating vital water. If it continues, battlefields\r\nwill create deserts of sorrow and days of darkness.\r\nCampuses of learning will be replaced by camps of\r\nviolence.\r\nBut this is neither a decree of heaven nor the\r\nverdict of man. It can, it should, it will be different.\r\nSouth Africa, Ireland, Yugoslavia and the Congo\r\nachieved more by talking than by shooting, more by\r\ndialogue than by dispute. We offered the Palestinians a\r\ncomprehensive solution without the terror — a solution\r\nthat was close to their national aspirations. We related\r\nto their desire to be free, to be equal, to be\r\nindependent. We agreed that they would have their land\r\nin accordance with United Nations resolutions. But\r\nterror postponed their destiny. Terror postponed our\r\nwillingness to end control over their lives. Smoking\r\nguns replaced the torches of peace.\r\nNow we are following the profound debate taking\r\nplace among the Palestinians. We respect it, because\r\ndebate is the beginning of democracy. When\r\ndemocracy prevails, peace undoubtedly will arrive. The\r\nFatah organization apparently issued a call that\r\ncontains some new approaches. I shall quote one of\r\nthem:\r\n“We will build an independent State of\r\nPalestine and a political system in accordance\r\nwith the principles of democracy, the rule of law,\r\nwith an independent judicial system, separation\r\nof power, respect for human rights, civil liberties\r\nand a market economy.”\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nWe look upon these words as the dawn of a\r\ndifferent season; we hope that it is spring. Reducing\r\nviolence will shorten political distances. Political\r\nhorizons are, in my judgement, within reach. Israel\r\naccepts President Bush’s vision. That vision is\r\nsupported by the Quartet; it is endorsed by Arab\r\ncountries; it outlines a political goal and a timetable. It\r\ncan be considered as both a road map and a calendar.\r\nWhat is needed now are wheels to propel the vehicles\r\nof peace. An economic wheel is needed in order for us\r\nto move to a global market economy that leads to\r\nscience-based industry. A market economy can open\r\ngates and skies. An ecological wheel is needed to let\r\nair and water flow cleanly. Pollution is not national; we\r\nhave to work together to control it. Ecology has\r\nchanged history. In the past, bloodshed was about real\r\nestate, and real estate created divisions, demarcation\r\nand, unfortunately, wars as well. In our era, the battle is\r\nnot for real estate but for air, for water and for energy;\r\nit is about the fertility of the land, rather than its size.\r\n“Non-real” estate is not marked, nor can it be divided.\r\nEither we respect it unanimously, or we will be\r\nvictimized by its loss.\r\nThen there is the cultural wheel. Three\r\ncivilizations were born in the Middle East. They were\r\nmade manifest in the Bible, in the New Testament and\r\nin the Koran. We read them in different languages, yet\r\nwe pray to the same heavens. The descendants of\r\nAbraham should behave like a family — with tolerance\r\nand solidarity. Spiritual leaders should pray for peace,\r\nbut they also need to preach it, call upon it and\r\ncontribute to it.\r\nThe political wheel should not rotate in the same\r\nmisguided orbit as in the past. We have been through\r\nfive wars in five decades — Palestinians, Egyptians\r\nand Jordanians lost generations of young people. We\r\npaid heavily with young blood as a result of three terror\r\ncampaigns. The time has come to comprehend that the\r\nreal triumph is in the harvest of peace, not in the seeds\r\nof another war. When we replace the war maps with\r\npeace maps, we will discover that the differences were\r\nminimal. The wars were appalling. We shall see that\r\nthe promised land could have become the land of\r\npromise a long time ago.\r\nWithout wars, our region will be able to bloom\r\nagain. We can separate politically into two States and\r\ncoordinate one economy. That will enable us to take\r\nadvantage of the exceptional invitation that came from\r\nboth the United States and a united Europe to partake\r\nin their economic opportunities.\r\nTourism can flourish when terrorism has ended.\r\nIslands of high-tech excellence can be established.\r\nMillions of trees can be planted to produce a new\r\nclimate. We can make green our arid lands. We can\r\nbecome contributors, not dependants.\r\nThe call of the future cannot be harmonized with\r\nthe voices of the past. Only new solutions can evoke a\r\ngrandeur equal to the past. We do not have the right to\r\nsuspend it in the face of our children. Young Israelis\r\nand young Palestinians are entitled to a new life — a\r\nlife of their own. While fighting terror, let us not fight\r\npeople. While seeking freedom, let us not extend\r\nsubjugation.\r\nI should like to direct a comment to Syria. The\r\nsame principle that enabled us both to participate in the\r\nMadrid conference a decade ago is still valid.\r\nA word to Lebanon: Israel is committed to the\r\nterritorial integrity of Lebanon. Israel respects its need\r\nfor real political independence. Lebanon should not\r\npermit Hezbollah to destroy its own country. Hezbollah\r\nis not a party, it is a dangerous agenda. Lebanon should\r\nimmediately free Israeli prisoners and prisoners of war.\r\nThe people of the Middle East should let bygones\r\nbe bygones. Let us return to our traditions, where\r\nprophets, not terrorists, told the future. Let us return to\r\nour landscape, where the blue skies did not surrender to\r\nthe heavy clouds of despair; to a time when justice\r\npromised equal opportunities for individuals and for\r\nnations. Let us join, together, the march of mankind\r\ntowards new discoveries that will make life more\r\npurposeful and may bring security to posterity.\r\nWe were born in the cradles of hope, not in the\r\ntombs of despair. We guard our spiritual heritage, and\r\nit is not antithetical to building a new Middle East. The\r\nworld is new.\r\nI should like to conclude with an old verse from\r\nour scriptures:\r\n“The Lord led Adam through the Garden of\r\nEden and said to him, ‘All I created, I created for\r\nyou. Beware lest you spoil and destroy my world,\r\nfor if you spoil it, there is no one to repair it after\r\nyou’.”\r\nWe are here to repair.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Hor Namhong, Senior Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nCambodia.\r\nMr. Hor Namhong (Cambodia) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I should like at the outset to join other\r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nseventh session. We are fully confident that, under your\r\nable leadership, the work of the General Assembly will\r\nfurther advance the cause of international cooperation\r\nin the interests of humankind.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nwelcome the Swiss Confederation, which has become\r\nthe one hundred and ninetieth Member of our world\r\nOrganization. I am also pleased to extend a warm\r\nwelcome to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste,\r\nwhich will soon be joining our global Organization.\r\nI believe that we are living in a fragile and fast-\r\nchanging world, a world of uncertainties and\r\nturbulence that has been seriously threatened by\r\nterrorism, the negative aspects of globalization, the\r\nrising effects of global warming and the impact of\r\nclimate change. The effects of these rising forces\r\nunderline our common vulnerability and recall the\r\nurgent need for more effective sustainable development\r\nin the world, without which the survival of humanity\r\nmay be jeopardized. I therefore believe that the\r\ncommon challenge we face today is perhaps the lack of\r\ncollective wisdom and political will to make our world\r\na better place for all, including future generations.\r\nThe recent World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Johannesburg rightly discussed the\r\nfundamental issues confronting humanity: climate\r\nchange, global sustainable development and poverty.\r\nThe dramatic appeal made by many leaders of the\r\nworld at that Summit must be taken very seriously as\r\nan important message about the need to save the Earth\r\nfrom destruction and to reverse the global trends of\r\nwidening development gaps, increasing poverty and\r\nenvironmental destruction.\r\nWith respect to the environment, I believe that\r\nhumanity as a whole is now confronting severe global\r\nwarming, unprecedented flooding and the increasingly\r\ndisastrous effects of greenhouse gases. This is no\r\nlonger just a scientific theory, but a living reality. For\r\nthe first time this year, we have experienced mega-\r\nfloods and serious droughts across continents — from\r\nAsia to Europe, from Africa to South America — that\r\nhave wrought immense destruction and cost billions of\r\ndollars. We must seek to reverse these negative trends\r\nfor the survival of humanity. In this regard, I think that\r\nwe should all welcome and strongly support the bold\r\nmessage of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the ultimate goal of which was to ensure\r\nthe survival of humanity and to fight poverty and\r\nenvironmental destruction.\r\nI also wish to recall the 2000 Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which centred on fighting poverty,\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS, ensuring sustainable\r\ndevelopment and forging a common partnership for\r\ndevelopment. In the same vein, the United Nations\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, held in March in Monterrey, Mexico,\r\ncalled on the developed countries to provide greater\r\nassistance to the least developed. Without adequate\r\nresources, it will be difficult for the least developed\r\ncountries to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty\r\nand to catch up with the current process of\r\nglobalization. I believe that this is a question not of\r\ngenerosity, but of human dignity and of sharing the\r\nwealth of the world in which we all live in the most\r\nequitable way.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs the world continues to be shaped by the forces\r\nof globalization, we are witnessing growing disparities\r\nand development gaps between the haves and have-\r\nnots. As a double-edged sword, globalization could\r\neither help to propel humanity as a whole to greater\r\nprosperity or further marginalize the poor. I believe\r\nthat reducing poverty could contribute to some extent\r\nto the fight against terrorism and effectively manage\r\nthe growth of transnational issues, such as human\r\ntrafficking and the prevalent HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nIn this context, the Cambodian Government,\r\nunder the leadership of Prime Minister Samdech Hun\r\nSen, has made the fight against poverty a top priority\r\nof its strategy. In addition, human rights and\r\ndemocracy in Cambodia have been further\r\nstrengthened. In February this year, Cambodia for the\r\nfirst time organized free and fair local elections as part\r\nof its decentralization policy and its efforts to\r\nstrengthen grass-roots democracy. Moreover,\r\nCambodia remains committed to contributing actively\r\ntowards the realization of integration of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), so\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nthat ASEAN may move forward in a collective spirit\r\nand play its constructive role in deepening East Asian\r\ncooperation as a whole. In this regard, the forthcoming\r\nGreater Mekong subregion and ASEAN summits in\r\nPhnom Penh in early November will be important\r\nvenues for ASEAN leaders to further promote ASEAN\r\nintegration and build closer cooperation in East Asia,\r\nencompassing the 10 nations of South-East Asia,\r\nChina, Japan and the Republic of Korea.\r\nOn regional issues that concern the whole\r\ninternational community, I wish to raise the Middle\r\nEast conflict first. I believe that the international\r\ncommunity has to help find a viable solution which\r\ncould bring lasting peace to the region. Cambodia\r\nstrongly believes that violence in any form is not a\r\nsolution. On the contrary, violence provokes more\r\nviolence. The Palestinian people have an inalienable\r\nright to dispose of their own State, living in peace with\r\nIsrael. I think that both sides must have the wisdom to\r\nunderstand that they are condemned to living side by\r\nside forever. Therefore, it is better for both sides to\r\nremain at peace with each other than to engage in\r\nendless war.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the Iraqi situation,\r\nCambodia believes that Iraq’s acceptance of the return\r\nof United Nations weapons inspectors is an important\r\nstep that will certainly contribute to defusing the\r\nsituation in the region.\r\nThirdly, on the Kashmir problem, I believe that\r\nwe need to avoid the escalation of that conflict. If not\r\nproperly managed, the Kashmir conflict could seriously\r\nescalate and thus threaten regional peace and security\r\nnot only in South Asia, but also in South-East Asia. We\r\nmust do what we can to ensure that the terrorists cannot\r\nseize the opportunity of that conflict to further\r\ncomplicate the present situation.\r\nOn a more optimistic note, I believe that the\r\nrecent positive developments in the Korean\r\npeninsula — especially the resumption of North-South\r\ndialogue and the historic visit of Japanese Prime\r\nMinister Koizumi to Pyongyang — are significant\r\nmilestones towards the normalization of the situation\r\nthere.\r\nAs far as the fight against terrorism is concerned,\r\nCambodia has signed and is in the process of acceding\r\nto all 12 conventions related to the combat against\r\nterrorism. ASEAN, for its part, has been forceful and\r\ndecisive in coming up with a number of initiatives and\r\nmeasures. The ASEAN leaders, at their Seventh\r\nSummit in Brunei in November 2001, adopted the\r\nASEAN Declaration on Joint Action to Counter\r\nTerrorism. In addition, there have been a number of\r\nagreements and specific action plans that ASEAN and\r\nthe ASEAN Regional Forum have put in place in order\r\nto tackle the threats of terrorism in our region. In July\r\nthis year, ASEAN and the United States signed an anti-\r\nterrorism declaration as a framework for more\r\ncooperation to prevent and combat global terrorism.\r\nNow, I wish to address the issue of reforming the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council,\r\nwhich I believe we should not simply ignore or take a\r\nstatus quo approach to. I believe that the United\r\nNations cannot continue to work in its current modus\r\noperandi if we want to further improve this important\r\nglobal institution and to have it truly reflect the needs\r\nand political realities of the world in the twenty-first\r\ncentury, to which it should be adapted as soon as\r\npossible. Any attempt to further delay United Nations\r\nreform, in my view, will only undermine the credibility\r\nof this universal institution.\r\nMr. Mesfin (Ethiopia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAccordingly, I wish to reiterate Cambodia’s call for the\r\nexpansion of the Security Council to include other new\r\nmembers. In that regard, Cambodia would support\r\nJapan, the Federal Republic of Germany and India as\r\nnew permanent members of the Security Council,\r\ntaking into account the growing political and economic\r\nroles of those countries in world affairs.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that peace,\r\nstability and poverty are all interrelated and affect all\r\npeoples and nations of the planet. From that point of\r\nview, it is essential that we continue to work together\r\nto build a caring community of nations, where the\r\ndevelopment gap between the developed and the\r\ndeveloping countries is reduced, the threat of terrorism\r\nis totally eliminated, the menace of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic is curbed, poverty is alleviated and global\r\nwarming is kept in check. That will be possible only by\r\nbuilding better cooperation and closer partnership,\r\nfostering mutual respect, cultivating greater tolerance\r\nand enhancing the spirit of a real United Nations for\r\nall. I strongly believe that we can do that through\r\ncollective will and strong determination, as well as\r\nbetter ethics and moral responsibility, which will help\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nus make a better world for all peoples in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Augusto Casali, Minister for Foreign\r\nand Political Affairs of San Marino.\r\nMr. Casali (San Marino) (spoke in Italian;\r\nEnglish text provided by delegation): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino, I wish first\r\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan on his\r\nelection as President of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that his experience,\r\nprofessional skills and dynamism will contribute to the\r\nsuccess of our work. I also wish to thank Dr. Han\r\nSeung-soo for having presided over the General\r\nAssembly in one of the most difficult and delicate\r\nmoments of our recent history.\r\nInevitably, this session of the General Assembly\r\nis still suffering the consequences of a deep, indelible\r\nwound that, a little more than a year ago, was inflicted\r\non the whole of humanity, on the people who\r\ncontributed to creating this civilization and, in\r\nparticular, on a great and friendly nation, whose role\r\nhas always been crucial to the future of our planet.\r\nFeelings of pain and fright, but also rebellion, are\r\nstill vivid in the minds of each and every one of us.\r\nThe firm and absolute condemnation of what happened\r\nlast year in September remains unchanged and has been\r\nfurther strengthened by the determination to spare no\r\neffort in combating and if possible defeating the\r\ndreadful threat of terrorism, which is still present.\r\nHowever, San Marino is convinced that fighting\r\nterrorism exclusively through military, political and\r\neconomic actions is not enough. We must ask ourselves\r\nwhy terrorism comes about and develops, why\r\nfundamentalism and fanaticism exist, why some\r\nindividuals who proclaim to fight for the liberation of\r\nthe oppressed become instruments of death. We may\r\nhave found an answer, and that is why we keep on\r\nrepeating in all forums, that as long as the world is\r\nstricken by hunger, poverty, underdevelopment,\r\ninequality, oppression, ignorance and violations of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, there will be\r\nno solution to all the political, economic and social\r\nsituations that are inexorably degenerating, which we\r\ncontinue to witness with a growing feeling of anguish,\r\nuncertainty and instability for a whole generation, for\r\nthe whole of mankind.\r\nWith that in mind, San Marino has fully\r\nsupported the initiatives and the procedures established\r\nby the Security Council to stem the expansion of\r\nterrorism. The Republic I represent has met in a timely\r\nmanner the requirements set forth by the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee established by the Security\r\nCouncil itself. In the same way, a number of legislative\r\nand financial measures on anti-terrorism adopted by\r\nSan Marino Parliament and Government are evidence\r\nof our will to proceed with the ratification of the\r\nrelevant international Conventions and of the intention\r\nto pass a special law to counter terrorism and its\r\nfinancing.\r\nWe also believe that dialogue and tolerance\r\namong all peoples of the world are further instruments\r\nto combat terrorism and fundamentalism. That calls not\r\nonly for effective political action, but also for a new\r\nculture to develop within peoples, where diversity\r\nbecomes a universal heritage, and leads to unity rather\r\nthan division, helps eliminate, rather than worsen,\r\ndisparities, brings different cultures, religions and\r\ntraditions closer together, rather than turning them into\r\ninstruments of incomprehension and confrontation.\r\nIt is a disgrace that a solution to the ongoing\r\nconflict and violence in the Middle East seems out of\r\nreach. Terrorist attacks and military reprisals further\r\nexacerbate hatred and revenge, undermining any\r\npossibility of promoting negotiations and dialogue on\r\nthe basis of mutual respect and protecting human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms. San Marino is deeply\r\nconcerned about the worsening situation in this area\r\nand strongly condemns the spiral of violence plaguing\r\nthat region and indiscriminately causing victims every\r\nday, mainly among civilians, especially women and\r\nchildren.\r\nIsrael has the legitimate right to exist within its\r\nown borders and to defend and protect its own\r\npopulation. Palestinians have the same legitimate right,\r\nto live on their own land and the right to self-\r\ndetermination within their own State. Therefore, we\r\ndeem it imperative that both parties respect the rules of\r\ninternational law and fully comply with all United\r\nNations resolutions. Most recently, tensions have\r\nescalated further because of the possibility of a war\r\nagainst Iraq in order to remove its President, Saddam\r\nHussein.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino can certainly neither\r\ntolerate nor accept that the world be held hostage by\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nunscrupulous dictators who are absolutely unreliable\r\nand who are probably willing and able to jeopardize\r\ninternational security. Yet, any action, including\r\nmilitary intervention as a last resort, would in any case\r\nrequire the consensus and authorization of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe international scene is marked on many fronts\r\nby dread and insecurity. Nonetheless, San Marino\r\nfollows with interest and supports the intensive activity\r\nthat the United Nations is conducting to tackle a\r\nnumber of issues with the ultimate goal of attaining a\r\nmore civilized, equitable, humane society fit for\r\nhumankind.\r\nWe followed with great attention the major\r\nconferences that the United Nations promoted and\r\norganized in 2002, especially those on children, the\r\nageing and sustainable development.\r\nThe twenty-seventh special session of the General\r\nAssembly on Children agreed that in order to\r\nimplement the principles enshrined in the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child, it is imperative to attain\r\nthree major objectives: to guarantee children a decent\r\nstandard of living in a safe environment in which they\r\ncan grow up and develop physically, mentally and\r\nemotionally in a healthy manner; to ensure that they\r\ncan complete at least primary school; and to provide\r\nadolescents with the opportunity to strengthen their\r\nindividual capacities in a safe environment, so that they\r\nwill be able to fully participate in and contribute to the\r\nsociety in which they live. San Marino shares those\r\npriorities and has adopted a number of legislative,\r\nsocial and cultural initiatives to implement those\r\nfundamental principles.\r\nMy country also welcomes the activities carried\r\nout by the international community which, on the\r\noccasion of the Second World Assembly on Ageing\r\nheld last April in Madrid, adopted a political\r\ndeclaration and a new plan of action to safeguard the\r\ninterests and needs of the elderly, a population group\r\nwhich has so far probably been neglected although it\r\nwill considerably increase in number over the next few\r\nyears.\r\nSan Marino attaches great importance to the\r\nsignificant changes brought about by the Assembly in\r\nthe methods used to face and solve the problems of the\r\nageing population, while seeking to eradicate\r\nstereotypes and prejudices. We have a feeling that in so\r\ndoing, the international community has laid down the\r\nfoundations for a future plan of action that will ensure\r\nfor all human beings wellness, health and security in\r\nthe last years of their lives.\r\nAlso within the framework of the United Nations,\r\nalthough it had different objectives, the recent World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development held in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa was also of great\r\nimportance. San Marino is aware that the economic\r\ngrowth of the most developed nations must go hand in\r\nhand with economic growth at the global level.\r\nGlobalization, however, cannot be imposed. On the\r\ncontrary, it must be conceived as an opportunity for all\r\nStates and populations. It must facilitate access to\r\nmarkets for developing countries and promote targeted\r\ninvestments that take social and environmental\r\nconsiderations into account. At the same time, we have\r\nto build confidence and foster economic well-being to\r\nachieve the integration which we all deem to be\r\nessential. Such integration is also a precondition for the\r\nprotection of both the environment and cultural\r\ndiversity.\r\nI would like to recall that the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court entered into force on 1\r\nJuly, 2002. With that formal achievement, the\r\ncommunity of States made a great leap forward in the\r\nprogress of international law, the Court being not only\r\na judicial institution created to prosecute genocide and\r\ncrimes against humanity, but also clear evidence of the\r\nwill existing at an international level to avoid granting\r\nimpunity — as is too often the case — to perpetrators\r\nof atrocious and intolerable crimes against peoples or\r\nindividuals.\r\nAs well, because of the role of guarantor assigned\r\nto that institution, the Republic of San Marino\r\nparticipated in the celebration of the fourth anniversary\r\nof the Court on 17 July, 2002 and was the first State in\r\nEurope to ratify its Statute. Furthermore, my\r\nGovernment believes that the International Criminal\r\nCourt does not in any way endanger the international\r\npeacekeeping forces. On the contrary, the Court further\r\nguarantees their protection through the articles of its\r\nStatute. For that reason, my country hopes that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court will be joined and\r\nsupported by as many countries as possible, and that\r\npractical solutions will be found that do not alter the\r\nStatute of Rome but that guarantee the continuity of\r\npeace operations.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nOn this occasion, on behalf of the Government of\r\nSan Marino I feel it is my duty to reaffirm the\r\nimportance and the key role played by the General\r\nAssembly as the main decision-making and\r\nrepresentative body. Unquestionably, the functions of\r\nthe General Assembly and the effectiveness of its\r\ndecisions need strengthening. Moreover, the General\r\nAssembly should intensify its co-operation with the\r\nother United Nations bodies, primarily with the\r\nSecurity Council. A working group to which San\r\nMarino has also contributed ideas and proposals has\r\nbeen studying Security Council reform for eight years.\r\nAll Members probably know that San Marino has long\r\ntaken a stance in favour of an increase in the number of\r\nnon-permanent members on the Security Council,\r\nwhile it agrees neither with an increase in permanent\r\nseats nor with the extension of the right of veto. We\r\nconsider that this would have a positive effect on many\r\nactivities of the United Nations and therefore that it\r\nwould be beneficial to relations among and between\r\nStates; it is something which is now sorely needed.\r\nI wish to conclude by reasserting that the only\r\nway to overcome the consequences of the painful\r\nevents that we have recently experienced is to pool our\r\nefforts and to work together, honestly and actively, in\r\norder to start a virtuous cycle in which the objectives\r\nof civil and tolerant coexistence among peoples and\r\nnations are universally shared, supported and pursued;\r\nin which the values of solidarity, respect for human life\r\nand dignity dismantle the barriers of selfishness and\r\noppression; and in which democracy and freedom from\r\nall constraints and needs become effective.\r\nThese are the same objectives that a small State\r\ncalled the Republic of San Marino, which I have the\r\nhonour to represent here today in the most authoritative\r\nand prestigious international Organization, has sought\r\nto achieve over 17 centuries of history in a consistent,\r\npersistent but also humble manner.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. François Lonsény Fall, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Guinea.\r\nMr. Fall (Guinea) (spoke in French): Allow me,\r\nat the outset, to express my warm congratulations and\r\nwishes to His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan for every\r\nsuccess on his election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly. I should also\r\nlike to express my delegation’s gratitude to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo for the competent and\r\nable manner in which he conducted the work of the\r\nfifty-sixth session. I wish to convey to His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, the sincere\r\nappreciation of His Excellency General Lansana Conté,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea, for his tireless and\r\ndedicated efforts on behalf of the community of\r\nnations.\r\nIn addition, I wish to welcome the admission of\r\nthe Swiss Confederation, a country of great traditions\r\nof peace and democracy, to the Organization. My\r\ndelegation looks forward with great interest to the\r\nforthcoming entry of the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste to the family of nations. I remain\r\nconvinced that the accession of those two countries\r\nwill make a high-quality contribution to the endeavours\r\nof the international community and will strengthen the\r\nOrganization’s universality.\r\nTwelve months have passed since the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001. The global security\r\nclimate has suffered profound changes, casting new\r\nlight on the dangers of international terrorism and its\r\ninterdependence with other forms of crime. Terrorism,\r\none need hardly stress again, constitutes a menace to\r\ninternational peace and security. Faced with the global\r\ndimensions of that scourge, my country associates\r\nitself fully with the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity with a view to providing an appropriate\r\nresponse.\r\nIn that regard, we hope for the prompt adoption\r\nof a general convention against terrorism and for the\r\neffective implementation of other existing international\r\nlegal instruments. Within the framework of the\r\ndialogue among civilizations, an appeal should be\r\naddressed to all countries for the organization of an\r\nextensive campaign of education and consciousness-\r\nraising in order to promote tolerance, respect and\r\nacceptance of others.\r\nThe current session is being held in a difficult\r\ninternational context dominated by numerous conflicts\r\nthat compromise legitimate aspirations to peace and\r\nprogress. In this climate of violence, nevertheless, a\r\ngleam of hope can be glimpsed on the African\r\ncontinent. We welcome the important progress made\r\ntowards the restoration of peace in Angola and in the\r\nGreat Lakes region, especially in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi. In the Horn of\r\nAfrica, peace between Eritrea and Ethiopia is gradually\r\nreturning, but the Somalia crisis remains more\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nworrisome than ever. In Western Sahara, my country\r\nsupports the remarkable work accomplished by the\r\nPersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. James\r\nBaker. We encourage him to persist in his efforts with a\r\nview to finding an acceptable and definitive solution to\r\nthat crisis.\r\nIn the Middle East, the conflict situation persists.\r\nThe cycle of acute violence over the past two years has\r\nwidened further the gap between the parties,\r\nreinforcing the wall of misunderstanding. The\r\nGovernment of Guinea is convinced that the\r\napplication of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973) will allow Palestinians and Israelis to\r\ncoexist peacefully within secure and internationally\r\nrecognized borders. We appeal to the two parties to\r\ncomply unconditionally with Council resolutions 1397\r\n(2002) and 1402 (2002). We reaffirm the support and\r\nthe solidarity of Guinea to the brotherly people of\r\nPalestine, to the Palestinian Authority and to its head,\r\nPresident Yasser Arafat, who has fought courageously\r\nfor the creation of an independent and sovereign\r\nPalestinian State for more than 50 years.\r\nThe situation in Iraq is a source of vital concern\r\nto the people and the Government of Guinea. In order\r\nto prevent further suffering by the Iraqi population and\r\nto preserve peace in the region as well as international\r\nsecurity and stability, my country invites the parties to\r\nshow greater restraint. Iraq’s acceptance of the\r\nunconditional return of the United Nations Monitoring,\r\nVerification and Inspection Commission is an\r\nencouraging sign for the peaceful settlement of the\r\ncrisis. My delegation appeals earnestly to Iraq to\r\nrespect and comply with the relevant Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nTurning to the Korean Peninsula, Guinea supports\r\nthe efforts for peaceful reunification of the two Koreas,\r\nin conformity with the declaration signed by the heads\r\nof State of the two countries in June 2001.\r\nMy Government reaffirms its attachment to the\r\nprinciple of one China.\r\nI now turn to the situation in our subregion, West\r\nAfrica, an area that has long been shaken by internal\r\ncrises but that is now moving towards a climate of\r\npeace and stability. Sierra Leone has committed itself\r\nto the path of peace and reconciliation, thanks to the\r\nmediation of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and to the support of the\r\nUnited Nations. That success was also made possible\r\nby the United Kingdom’s important role. In Liberia, the\r\nsituation is still precarious. My delegation remains\r\nconvinced that the adoption and effective\r\nimplementation of a programme of disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of armed groups,\r\nbased on the successful conclusion of the inter-\r\nLiberian dialogue begun in Abuja, will contribute to\r\nthe restoration of peace and stability in the subregion.\r\nGuinea, a member of the Mano River Union, renews its\r\ncommitment to continuing to work for peace.\r\nBecause of that commitment, my country took an\r\nactive part, in the Rabat Summit, on 27 February 2002\r\nand in the process of implementing its\r\nrecommendations. The political dialogue at the Summit\r\nshould be pursued with a view to strengthening\r\nconfidence between the parties. In that regard, it is\r\nimportant to point out that the Joint Security\r\nCommittee of the Mano River Union, which met in\r\nFreetown on 10 September 2002, decided to\r\nsimultaneously reopen the borders among the three\r\ncountries of the Union and to organize a caravan for\r\npeace next October that will tour those countries. My\r\ndelegation takes this opportunity to again express its\r\nprofound gratitude to His Majesty King Mohammed VI\r\nof Morocco for his mediation. The political dialogue at\r\nthe Summit and the respect for measures imposed by\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1343 (2001) represent two\r\ncomplementary tracks of managing the situation in the\r\nMano River Basin. The international community, in\r\nparticular the Council, should ensure follow-up, while\r\nbearing in mind the interdependence of the situations in\r\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. The Government of Guinea\r\nhopes that the establishment of the Office of the\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nWest Africa will contribute to meeting the challenges\r\nfaced by the States of the subregion. We also welcome\r\nthe creation of a Security Council Working Group on\r\nConflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa. Clearly,\r\nthat initiative is likely to contribute to our common\r\nreflection on such problems.\r\nDisarmament issues, particularly those related to\r\nlight weapons and to anti-personnel mines, remain a\r\nsource of concern. As members are aware, Guinea\r\nbelongs to a subregion whose population continues to\r\nsuffer the adverse effects of the proliferation and the\r\nillicit circulation of light weapons, which feed\r\nconflicts, lead to the resurgence of crime and\r\nencourage the phenomenon of child soldiers.\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nWe welcome the renewal of the ECOWAS\r\nMoratorium aimed at eradicating that phenomenon. We\r\ncall for the implementation of all measures for the\r\ndismantling of supply networks of small arms and light\r\nweapons. We support the pursuit of all the activities\r\nunder way to alleviate the suffering and loss of life\r\ncaused by anti-personnel mines.\r\nThe consequences of armed conflicts and natural\r\ndisasters primarily affect vulnerable civilian\r\npopulations, which constitute the majority of refugees\r\nand displaced persons. For more than a decade, Guinea\r\nhas been hard hit by the negative socio-economic,\r\nsecurity and environmental impact of wars in Liberia,\r\nSierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to reiterate our\r\nappeal for the holding of a special consultation of the\r\nUnited Nations on Guinea. In this context, my country\r\nappreciates the renewed commitment made by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at\r\nthe workshop held on 18 July 2002 by the Security\r\nCouncil on the countries of the Mano River Union.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the creation of the\r\nRegional Bureau for humanitarian affairs in West\r\nAfrica, the extension of the rapid response system for\r\nnatural disasters and the setting up of the integrated\r\nregional information network.\r\nPrevention and resolution of conflicts calls for the\r\nreduction of poverty and eradication of disease. The\r\nquestion of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis\r\nremains a source of concern, especially for developing\r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa. The adoption by\r\nthe General Assembly of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nthe declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS and the\r\n2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing\r\nCountries, Particularly in Africa, are significant steps\r\nforward.\r\nBut the question of mobilizing resources remains\r\ncentral to this effort. The primary responsibility for\r\nmeasures to be taken to implement these initiatives\r\nfalls to African leaders. However, they need to be\r\nsupported at the community, national, regional and\r\ninternational levels.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative that led to the creation of the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other\r\ntransmittable diseases. One of the commitments made\r\nby heads of State and Government at the historic\r\nMillennium Summit was to reduce, if not eliminate,\r\npoverty. But much of the planet’s population is still\r\nliving in absolute poverty. This situation is aggravated\r\nby the effects of globalization that, in the absence of\r\njust and equitable rules, increases the capacity of the\r\nstrong to promote their interests, while limiting that of\r\nthe weak.\r\nThe advent of the African Union illustrates the\r\nwill of African peoples to achieve the objectives of\r\neconomic integration and consolidate the foundations\r\nof peace, stability and security in Africa. In that\r\nframework the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) remains an effective\r\ninstrument for enhancing the African economies and\r\nbringing about their integration into the world\r\neconomy. My delegation appeals to the various partners\r\nto provide effective support in order to make that\r\ncommon vision a reality.\r\nWe hope that the decisions of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development in\r\nMonterrey, the commitments of the G-8 in Kananaskis\r\nand the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development held at Johannesburg will\r\nhave a positive impact on Africa.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the improvement of the\r\nprocedures and methods of work aimed at better\r\noperation of the General Assembly. We support the\r\nreform of the Security Council, to adapt it to the\r\nrequirements of democracy and transparency,\r\nespecially by increasing the number of its permanent\r\nand non-permanent members on the basis of a more\r\nequitable geographical distribution.\r\nTwo years after the historic Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the gap between North and South\r\ncontinues to widen. I wish to express our sincere hope\r\nfor the advent of a world of greater justice and\r\nsolidarity in the framework of true partnership for\r\npeace and development. Accordingly, we remain\r\nconvinced that the United Nations, reformed,\r\nrevitalized, adapted to new changes, remains a viable\r\nframework to face the challenges before us, and thus to\r\nensure for future generations the conditions necessary\r\nfor their fulfilment.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nguyen Dy Nien, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Viet Nam.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nMr. Nguyen Dy Nien (Viet Nam): Mr. President,\r\nI wish, at the outset, to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. I\r\nwould like also to express my high appreciation to his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of the\r\nRepublic of Korea for having efficiently presided over\r\nthe deliberations of the fifty-sixth session. Viet Nam\r\njoins others in welcoming the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste and the Confederation of Switzerland to\r\nour family of nations.\r\nWe come to this session with the remembrance of\r\nthe tragic incident of 11 September, when thousands of\r\ninnocent lives were lost in the towering inferno caused\r\nby terrorists. Our world has changed a lot since that\r\nday, as Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his\r\nstatement before this body last week, to the effect that\r\nthe terrorist attacks of 11 September were not an\r\nisolated event, that they were an extreme example of a\r\nglobal scourge, one which required a broad, sustained\r\nand global response.\r\nBy adopting Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001) and General Assembly resolution 56/1, by\r\nenacting and carrying out various measures in different\r\nfields, at national as well as regional levels, the\r\ncommunity of world countries has sent out a very clear\r\nand resolute message: we condemn in the most\r\ncategorical terms terrorism under whatever forms\r\nagainst innocent people, and we will take action under\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, because that must be\r\nthe way for our fight to be sustained.\r\nFighting terrorism does not simply mean bringing\r\nto justice the perpetrators and conspirators, but also\r\ntackling the poverty, injustice, subjugation and illegal\r\noccupation that underlie it. That is to say, while\r\nfighting against terrorism remains high on our agenda,\r\nother issues, notably the resolution of regional conflicts\r\nand the implementation of important development\r\ngoals set out in the Millennium Declaration, such as\r\nalleviating poverty, narrowing the gap between the rich\r\nand the poor and development gaps within and among\r\nnations, fighting against HIV/AIDS, drugs, organized\r\ntransnational crime, protecting the environment — all\r\nthese should not be downgraded or become any less\r\nurgent.\r\nOver the past year, besides efforts against\r\nterrorism, the United Nations took the lead in\r\norganizing a series of important international\r\nconferences, most notably the Monterrey International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, the Special\r\nSession of the General Assembly on Children, the\r\nWorld Summit on Food Security and the Johannesburg\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, where\r\nconcrete measures were adopted in the interests of each\r\nand every nation. The United Nations also continued its\r\nimportant work on conflict prevention, peace-building\r\nin various parts of the world, including its preparations\r\nfor East Timor’s independence, and conflict resolution\r\nin Africa and elsewhere. Mention should be made of its\r\nefforts relating to the Peace Agreement between the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. The\r\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General should be\r\ncommended for these significant endeavours.\r\nEven with those achievements, however, the\r\nUnited Nations is expected to do more. The\r\nOrganization must enhance its efforts to help resolve\r\nprotracted conflicts, especially those in the Middle\r\nEast, by peaceful means and free from intervention and\r\nimposition. In this vein, we reiterate our full support\r\nfor the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to\r\nexercise their inalienable rights to self-determination\r\nand to live in an independent and sovereign State.\r\nWe welcome the dialogue between the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the\r\nRepublic of Korea and the resumption of talks between\r\nthe former and the United States, and we sincerely\r\nhope that they will lead to fruitful conclusions. We\r\nagain join other speakers in voicing our concern over\r\nthe issue of Iraq, and in welcoming all efforts to defuse\r\nthe tension. The acceptance by Iraq of the return of\r\nUnited Nations weapons inspectors without conditions\r\ngives us some hope that a military attack will be\r\navoided.\r\nIn a world of interdependence, we consider it\r\neven more important to uphold the principle of respect\r\nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of States. In this regard, an early end\r\nmust be put to the blockades and embargoes that for\r\ndecades have been causing immeasurable suffering to\r\nthe peoples of Cuba, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere.\r\nAs arms races re-escalate in many parts of the\r\nworld, the Conference on Disarmament, for four\r\nconsecutive years, has not been able to start its\r\nsubstantive work; we must find a way to break the\r\ndeadlock.\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nEffective measures to limit and mitigate the\r\nnegative impact of globalization on developing\r\ncountries need to be formulated and implemented to\r\nensure equal development opportunities for all nations.\r\nInternational commitments to raising and maintaining\r\nofficial development assistance at the level of 0.7 per\r\ncent of gross domestic product, to building an open,\r\nequitable multilateral trading system, to removing\r\nprotectionism with a view to facilitating access of\r\ngoods from developing countries into developed\r\nmarkets, to debt relief, and to implementing numerous\r\nprinciples to protect the global environment including\r\nthe principle of common but differentiated\r\nresponsibilities, and so on, must be strengthened and\r\nput into action. To accomplish these goals, the United\r\nNations and its affiliated agencies and organizations,\r\nespecially the financial institutions need to strengthen\r\nthemselves through the ongoing reform process.\r\nViet Nam continues to hold the view that this\r\nprocess should primarily focus on enhancing the role of\r\nthe General Assembly and on making the Security\r\nCouncil more democratic, representative, transparent\r\nand accountable through the expansion of its\r\nmembership in both the non-permanent and the\r\npermanent categories. In that connection, we wish to\r\nreaffirm our support for those candidates, such as\r\nIndia, Japan and Germany, that have the capability to\r\nmake major contributions to the work of that important\r\nbody.\r\nIn South-East Asia, the countries of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are\r\ndetermined to strengthen their unity and cooperation in\r\norder to respond to the challenges arising within and\r\noutside the region. The implementation of the Hanoi\r\nPlan of Action, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration\r\nand the Hanoi Declaration on narrowing the\r\ndevelopment gap for closer ASEAN integration has\r\nachieved initial encouraging results.\r\nASEAN has continued to further deepen its\r\nrelationship with its dialogue partners as well as other\r\ninternational institutions and organizations, with a view\r\nto contributing further to peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment. Apart from their strong commitment and\r\nenormous efforts devoted to the fight against terrorism,\r\nincluding the recent signing of the ASEAN-US Joint\r\nDeclaration for Cooperation to Combat International\r\nTerrorism, the ASEAN countries are working closely\r\nwith China for the early adoption of a declaration on\r\nthe conduct of parties in the South China Sea. This is\r\nanother positive development towards building a code\r\nof conduct in the South China Sea, as agreed by\r\nASEAN leaders at the Sixth ASEAN Summit, held in\r\nHanoi in December 1998, thereby contributing to the\r\npromotion of confidence-building and the resolution of\r\nall disputes by peaceful means.\r\nConsistent with its foreign policy of\r\nindependence, sovereignty, openness,\r\nmultilateralization and the diversification of its\r\nexternal relations as well as its desire to be a friend and\r\nreliable partner of all countries striving for\r\nindependence, peace and cooperation, Viet Nam has\r\ncontinued to develop and strengthen its friendships and\r\nmultifaceted cooperation with countries in and outside\r\nthe region, and with international organizations.\r\nViet Nam is expediting all necessary procedures to join\r\nthe World Trade Organization soon.\r\nThe free and democratic general elections held in\r\nMay 2002 and the successful conclusion of the first\r\nsession of the new National Assembly, with highly\r\nqualified representatives elected to important State,\r\nNational Assembly and Government positions for the\r\n2002-2007 term, constitute important events in the\r\npolitical life of our nation and create a firm foundation\r\nfor us to continue the renewal process aimed at\r\nbuilding Viet Nam into a strong country with a\r\nprosperous people and a just, democratic and civilized\r\nsociety. In striving for those goals, we hope to continue\r\nto enjoy the support and cooperation of all countries\r\nand organizations. For its part, Vietnam pledges to do\r\nits utmost to contribute to the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Leonardo Santos Simão, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Simão (Mozambique): I wish to join\r\nprevious speakers in congratulating Mr. Jan Kavan on\r\nhis election as President of the fifty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are confident that, with his\r\nexperience, wisdom and proven skills, our\r\ndeliberations will produce the desired successful\r\noutcome.\r\nLet me also pay a well-deserved tribute to his\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\nformer Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea, for the\r\nexcellent manner in which he discharged his duties as\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI would also wish to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his continued devotion to peace and\r\ndevelopment worldwide. During his recent visit to\r\nMozambique, we had the opportunity to discuss the\r\nbest ways of furthering the goals of the United Nations\r\nand strengthening cooperation between Mozambique\r\nand the United Nations. We remain committed to\r\ncontinuing to work closely with the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Government of Mozambique welcomes the\r\nSwiss Confederation as a Member of the United\r\nNations and looks forward to welcoming the\r\nDemocratic Republic of East Timor. They will further\r\nstrengthen our universal Organization.\r\nAllow me to express our sympathy to the peoples\r\nand the Governments of several countries in the world\r\nthat have recently been hit by severe floods. We in\r\nMozambique and in Southern Africa understand the\r\neconomic and social consequences of floods. Floods,\r\ndrought and other natural calamities have become a\r\nfrequent occurrence in the world, and in Africa in\r\nparticular. It is therefore our hope and expectation that\r\nwe will be able to prepare ourselves to better deal with\r\nissues arising from natural disasters. Perhaps it is high\r\ntime we revisit the outcome of the 1994 World\r\nConference on Natural Disaster Reduction, held in\r\nYokohama.\r\nThe 11 September 2001 attacks demonstrated to\r\nall of us the dangers of international terrorism, which\r\nrepresents a serious threat to the peace and security of\r\nevery nation, rich or poor. In that regard, it is our\r\ncollective duty to fight this threat effectively, under the\r\nleadership of the United Nations. To be successful in\r\nthis endeavour we need to clearly understand and\r\naddress the root causes of terrorism, amongst which we\r\nwant to stress poverty and other injustices.\r\nIn addition to Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), we must give due recognition to regional\r\nagreements and declarations to combat and eliminate\r\nterrorism, such as the 1999 Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention and\r\nCombating of Terrorism, and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) Declaration against\r\nTerrorism adopted by our heads of State or\r\nGovernment in January this year, as valuable tools for\r\nstrengthening cooperation and providing a platform for\r\neffective action to suppress terrorism.\r\nMozambique has already submitted its report on\r\nlegislation and measures for preventing and combating\r\nterrorism, and is in the final stages of the process of\r\nratifying all 12 conventions on terrorism. However, for\r\nthe effective implementation of these legal instruments\r\nMozambique needs support from the international\r\ncommunity to strengthen its institutions, namely the\r\npolice, the judiciary, the financial system and the\r\nAttorney-General’s office.\r\nWe have witnessed this year the holding of a\r\nnumber of major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits devoted to a wide range of socio-economic\r\nissues: the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, the World Food Summit, the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development and the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on Children. We have\r\nalso seen the holding in Barcelona of an international\r\nconference on HIV/AIDS, at which our leaders\r\nrecognized that this pandemic is a global problem\r\nchallenging our common will and requiring global\r\nresponsibility and response.\r\nThe common feature of all these events has been\r\nstrong and unanimous agreement on the need to ensure\r\nthe implementation of the agreed outcomes and\r\ncommitments in order to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Our leaders have stressed that for\r\nthis to happen, there is a need for unity of purpose,\r\ncollective responsibility and political will.\r\nWe should, continuously and critically, assess the\r\nprogress made in each area of commitment, with a\r\nview to realizing the aspirations and needs of our\r\npeoples. The future of the world is in our hands. We\r\nmust not fail to meet the expectations of our peoples.\r\nThe time has now come for action. We must act\r\ndecisively to honour the commitments made in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nMy Government has been following with keen\r\ninterest the latest developments in the Middle East. We\r\nurge both parties to return to the negotiating table to\r\nfind a lasting peace in that region; such a peace must\r\ninclude an independent Palestinian State living side by\r\nside with Israel, and the solution of outstanding issues\r\ndeemed important by both parties. Without a\r\ncomprehensive and just solution to the question of\r\nPalestine, and without full respect for the legitimate\r\ninterests of all the peoples of the region, the prospects\r\nof peace will remain elusive and distant. The\r\ninternational community should encourage both Israelis\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nand Palestinians to work hard for peace, drawing on all\r\nthe strength and resolve they need to overcome\r\nobstacles along the way. Taking into account our own\r\nexperience in Mozambique, we believe that peace is a\r\nreal possibility in the Middle East, and that the parties\r\nmust seize the opportunity now.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the Government of Iraq on its wise\r\ndecision to allow the return of the United Nations\r\ninspectors. It is our hope that the resumption of the\r\ninspections will mark a new era of cooperation between\r\nIraq and the United Nations within the spirit and the\r\nletter of the United Nations Charter and international\r\nlaw.\r\nThis session is taking place at a moment when we\r\nare witnessing important progress regarding the\r\nresolution of conflicts in Africa. In Angola we have\r\nnoted with satisfaction the conclusion of a\r\nMemorandum of Understanding between the\r\nGovernment and UNITA, which marked the end of a\r\nprotracted war. We salute this Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding and believe that it opens a new era for\r\nthe Angolan people: an era of hope and great\r\nexpectations. We appeal to the international community\r\nto continue supporting the people and the Government\r\nof Angola in the consolidation of peace and stability,\r\nnational reconstruction and the strengthening of\r\ndemocracy, as well as in responding to the current\r\nhumanitarian needs.\r\nSierra Leone is living in peace after the\r\nsuccessful implementation of the peace process, and\r\nfollowing general and presidential elections. We hope\r\nthat these positive developments will lead to the\r\nimprovement of the political environment in the Mano\r\nriver region as a whole.\r\nThe recent agreements between the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Rwanda, as well as the\r\nunderstanding between the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Uganda, have created the hope that the\r\npeace process will be irreversible. The attainment of\r\npeace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will\r\nundoubtedly contribute to bringing about the needed\r\nstability in the Great Lakes region, and will pave the\r\nway for the rapid economic integration of Southern\r\nAfrica. We believe that with good will there can be a\r\nsolution to the concerns of all parties involved in this\r\nconflict.\r\nIn the Comoros and in Lesotho, peace is now a\r\nreality. We salute the efforts made by the peoples of\r\nthose countries to make Africa a continent of hope. We\r\nare happy to see Ethiopia and Eritrea working together,\r\nwith the support of the United Nations, to strengthen\r\npeace and good-neighbourliness. The acceptance by\r\nboth parties of the decision of the Boundary\r\nCommission was a major step forward.\r\nMy Government is concerned at the lack of\r\nprogress in Western Sahara. We wish to encourage the\r\nUnited Nations and the parties concerned to pursue\r\nfurther efforts, within the established framework, with\r\na view to finding a lasting and internationally\r\nacceptable solution to this issue.\r\nThe African leaders established the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as an\r\ninstrument to address these problems. NEPAD is based\r\non the principle of African ownership aiming at setting\r\nan agenda to renew the continent and to encompass\r\nnational and regional priorities along with development\r\nplans. This is to be done through a participatory\r\nprocess and a new framework for interaction and\r\npartnership with the rest of the world.\r\nThe support already expressed by many partners\r\nof Africa is a signal that NEPAD is a viable initiative.\r\nIn that context, I would like to salute the encouraging\r\nresults of the Group of Eight Summit recently held in\r\nKananaskis, Canada, where the world’s most\r\nindustrialized countries expressed their support for\r\nNEPAD. In the same vein, I salute the results of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s high-level meeting on NEPAD,\r\nheld in this Hall two days ago. These results enhance\r\nour hope of a better future for Africa. Let us work\r\ntogether to make it a reality.\r\nIn Mozambique, as part of efforts to fight poverty\r\nand to implement the Millennium Declaration, the\r\nGovernment approved, and is implementing, a Plan of\r\nAction for the Eradication of Absolute Poverty, locally\r\nknown as PARPA. The overall objective of PARPA is\r\nthe substantial reduction of absolute poverty in the\r\ncountry through investment in education, health,\r\nagriculture and rural development, as well as through\r\ngood governance and macroeconomic stability.\r\nPARPA is partially financed by savings achieved\r\nthrough debt reduction from our creditors — bilateral\r\nand multilateral — under the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) Initiative. We are thankful to all our\r\npartners for the debt reduction and the cancellations we\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nare receiving. Let us continue to work together to find\r\na definitive solution.\r\nThis session is being held at a particularly\r\nimportant moment in the history of Mozambique, given\r\nthat on 4 October 2002 we will celebrate the 10th\r\nanniversary of the signing of the Rome Peace\r\nAgreement, which marked the end of a devastating war\r\nof destabilization. Ten years after this historic\r\nachievement, the Mozambicans have kept the peace\r\nand shown that they can live together in harmony.\r\nGiven the historic significance of this date, we have\r\ndeclared it a national holiday: the Day of Peace and\r\nReconciliation.\r\nMozambicans are today enjoying the dividends of\r\npeace, which were achieved with the invaluable\r\ncontribution of the United Nations in what became a\r\npeacekeeping operation success story.\r\nTo consolidate this hard-won peace, we are\r\nimplementing home-grown development plans with a\r\nview to promoting the welfare of our people. We are\r\nalso strengthening democracy, governance and the rule\r\nof law, and preparations are under way for the\r\nforthcoming municipal elections in 2003 and the\r\ngeneral and presidential elections in 2004.\r\nIn my address during the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, I spoke of the negative\r\nconsequences of the floods which affected\r\nMozambique during two consecutive years, 2000 and\r\n2001. Today, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that\r\nmost of the flood’s victims have been resettled and are\r\nengaged in productive activities. Mozambique’s\r\neconomy is gradually recovering from the scourge of\r\nthe floods, and, as a result of the hard work of the\r\nMozambican people and of adequate international\r\nassistance, my country achieved a growth rate of 13.9\r\nper cent in its gross domestic product last year and of\r\n12.1 per cent in the first six months of this year.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on assistance\r\nto Mozambique (A/57/97), which I commend, provides\r\na further account of the achievements recorded by the\r\nMozambican people in the process of national\r\nreconstruction and of economic and social\r\nrehabilitation following the floods of 2000 and 2001.\r\nThe 2001 Human Development Report gives additional\r\nevidence of the progress that has been achieved.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nthe sincere gratitude of the people and the Government\r\nof Mozambique to the international community for its\r\ninvaluable support to the victims of the flooding.\r\nMozambique will continue to count on the international\r\ncommunity’s support, in particular with a view to\r\nmitigating the effects of the drought that is affecting\r\nMozambique and other countries of southern and\r\neastern Africa, and in order better to prepare the\r\ncountry to face natural calamities.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm my\r\ncountry’s faith in the United Nations and in its Charter,\r\nfor they remain the indispensable foundation of a just,\r\npeaceful and more prosperous world. We believe that\r\nthe current reform of the United Nations will help it to\r\nprovide better service to Member States, particularly\r\nthose most in need. We are convinced that the reform\r\nwill give rise to a stronger United Nations, with a clear\r\nfocus on developing countries and on results-oriented\r\nactions.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Kolawolé Idji, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Benin.\r\nMr. Idji (Benin) (spoke in French): On behalf of\r\nthe delegation of the Republic of Benin, allow me to\r\nconvey to Mr. Jan Kavan our heartfelt congratulations\r\non his well-deserved election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His\r\nskills, his extensive experience in international affairs\r\nand his dedication to the lofty causes championed by\r\nthe United Nations guarantee the success of our work.\r\nI wish to assure him of my delegation’s full\r\ncooperation and support in ensuring the full success of\r\nthe work of this session.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity also to\r\ncongratulate and to thank his predecessor, Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea, who presided so\r\nably and with such dedication over the work of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the Assembly.\r\nI wish also to pay tribute to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, whose devotion and skills have\r\nenhanced the prestige of our Organization.\r\nThe message that I bring the Assembly from\r\nBenin is a message of peace, which our people are\r\nexperiencing, and a message of the preservation of\r\npeace in all its aspects, in keeping with the Charter of\r\nour Organization and with the Millennium Declaration,\r\nin which we pledged to build for future generations a\r\nworld free from fear, hunger and ignorance.\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nThe barbaric acts perpetrated a year ago, on 11\r\nSeptember 2001 here in New York and in other places,\r\nare still vivid in our memory, making ever more urgent\r\nthe need to make greater strides in our common\r\nendeavour of civilization. The sincere and spontaneous\r\ncompassion and sympathy of the peoples of the world\r\nfor the victims of the terrible attacks of 11 September\r\nprove that more than ever before we are bound by a\r\ncommon destiny.\r\nIt is therefore vital to give real meaning to this\r\nsolidarity and this shared responsibility. The United\r\nNations must continue to play a dynamic role in the\r\npromotion of international cooperation in order to\r\nprevent and punish acts of terrorism.\r\nFor Benin, nothing — no pretext whatsoever —\r\ncould justify such barbaric acts, and the terrifying\r\nimages that I am loath to recall today will remain\r\netched in our collective memory throughout the\r\ntwenty-first century. Benin’s firm commitment to\r\ncombating terrorism is unambiguous, and we intend to\r\nfight this scourge with resolve.\r\nThus, pursuant to Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), adopted on 28 September 2001, Benin\r\nsubmitted a report on the measures we have taken to\r\nprevent and punish acts of terrorism. A constructive\r\nand effective dialogue is under way with the Security\r\nCouncil Committee regarding proposed measures to\r\nprevent and suppress the financing of acts of terrorism.\r\nHowever, the anti-terrorist campaign will be more\r\neffective and more comprehensive if it is organized on\r\nthe basis of strict respect for the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations. We believe that there\r\nis an urgent need for a clear, precise, legal definition of\r\ninternational terrorism in order to prevent the\r\nhaphazard character of our individual or collective\r\ninitiatives from jeopardizing the effectiveness of the\r\nglobal coalition against the terrorist threat.\r\nBy placing Africa at the centre of its concerns for\r\nthe new millennium, the United Nations has rightly\r\nfocused the attention of the international community on\r\nthat continent, which, despite its commendable efforts,\r\nis having difficulty finding its way towards\r\ndevelopment. The persistence of war and conflict,\r\nwhich repeatedly lead to great bloodshed in that part of\r\nthe world, is one of the main reasons for that situation.\r\nAware that, as it faces new challenges, our\r\ncontinent is at a critical stage in its development and\r\nthat it is for Africa to shoulder its own responsibilities,\r\nAfrican leaders have taken a number of political\r\ninitiatives aimed at resolving conflict, rising to the\r\ngreat challenge of endowing Africa with new forums\r\nfor dialogue and action. This African renaissance, by\r\nmeans of which Africa is determined to take control of\r\nits own destiny and find solutions to its ills, should be\r\nencouraged through support for the African Union,\r\nwhich was launched in Durban, South Africa, in July\r\nthis year. The African Union espouses the vision of the\r\nfounding fathers of the African nations and of the\r\nformer Organization of African Unity. The African\r\nUnion is different from the Organization of African\r\nUnity because it stresses the need for the economic\r\nintegration of the continent and affirms that peace,\r\nsecurity and stability are indispensable conditions for\r\nthe creation of an environment conducive to\r\ndevelopment and that good governance must be the\r\nnorm for our States.\r\nI wish to reaffirm what many earlier speakers\r\nhave said: Africa is beginning to play its proper role. It\r\nlooks forward to a concrete demonstration of the\r\ngoodwill so often expressed by the international\r\ncommunity. It looks forward to real action in the form\r\nof deeds. We expect this for the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), for example.\r\nUnder the wise guidance of the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we spent an entire day debating that\r\nAfrican Union programme. Relevant remarks were\r\nuttered, commitments undertaken and forceful\r\nstatements made from this very rostrum, and I do not\r\nneed to dwell further on that subject. Now is the time\r\nfor action, and time is of the essence.\r\nGlobalization must become synonymous with a\r\nbetter life for all the peoples of the world. The world\r\ncannot just stand by and watch the spectacle of an\r\nAfrica that has been marginalized and ravaged by wars\r\nand disease. Africa must not be an object of\r\ncondescension, as if the world did not have sufficient\r\nresources to avert catastrophe. I am sure that our\r\ncollective awareness is real and sincere.\r\nThat is why I welcome the timely initiative of the\r\nSecurity Council to establish an Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup on Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa.\r\nWe hope that that initiative will demonstrate a genuine,\r\nongoing commitment on the part of the Security\r\nCouncil to act to put an end to the cycle of violence in\r\nAfrica, thereby according equal treatment to all\r\nhumanitarian crises without exception.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nIn the context of collective efforts to consider and\r\ndeal with the question of conflict prevention and\r\nresolution through a comprehensive, integrated\r\napproach that takes into account political, economic\r\nand social dimensions, my delegation recommends\r\nreinforced interaction between the Security Council\r\nand the Economic and Social Council, in particular by\r\ndeveloping close consultations with the Ad Hoc\r\nAdvisory Group of the Economic and Social Council\r\non African countries emerging from conflict.\r\nOne of the most encouraging signs for Africa in\r\nrecent years — indeed in recent months — is the firm\r\ndetermination finally to put an end to fratricidal\r\nwarfare. We must support such efforts everywhere,\r\nincluding in Sierra Leone, Angola, Congo, Eritrea and\r\nEthiopia.\r\nI want to comment in particular on Sierra Leone,\r\nwhich has successfully emerged from a risky and\r\ndangerous electoral process. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the United\r\nNations and to the countries which, at the bilateral\r\nlevel, have been helping Sierra Leone to reintegrate\r\nitself into the community of nations. I hope that the\r\npositive evolution of the situation in that country will\r\nhave a ripple effect within the Mano River Union.\r\nI welcome the outstanding progress that has been\r\nmade in the process towards the restoration of peace\r\nand security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nIn that respect, I would like to pay a well-deserved\r\ntribute to President Thabo Mbeki and to the facilitator,\r\nSir Ketumile Masire, for their commitment and\r\nperseverance.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the guns have now been\r\nsilenced in Angola after so many years of suffering,\r\ndestruction and privation. It is crucial to strengthen and\r\nconsolidate the peace process that is under way in that\r\ncountry. That is why I urgently appeal to the\r\ninternational community to provide support that is\r\ncommensurate with the enormous reconstruction needs\r\nof Angola. Only thus will conditions be right for the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nI am pleased to note, among the initiatives to\r\npromote peace in Africa, the success of negotiations on\r\nan agreement on the demarcation of the border between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea and the continuing dialogue to\r\nrestore peace in Burundi and the Sudan.\r\nIn January this year, 49 of the poorest countries\r\nof the world chose my country, Benin, to hold the\r\nchairmanship of the coordinating office for the least\r\ndeveloped countries. When we accepted that\r\nprestigious post, my Government was well aware of the\r\nheavy responsibilities that we were assuming.\r\nThe most important item on mankind’s agenda\r\ntoday is sustainable development. Any progress — or\r\nany regression — must be assessed by the group of\r\ncountries that Benin is now coordinating. The\r\ninternational community itself recognizes that many\r\nproblems remain. The Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries noted\r\nwith regret that previous goals had not been achieved,\r\nand it clearly identified the main obstacles to the\r\ndevelopment of the least developed countries. These\r\ninclude the continuing decrease in official development\r\nassistance, the debt burden, the difficulty of gaining\r\naccess to the markets of the developed countries and\r\nthe lack of foreign investment. By adopting a\r\nProgramme of Action and a Political Declaration at\r\nBrussels, the international community renewed its\r\ncommitment to helping the least developed countries\r\nresolutely to deal with mechanisms whose operations\r\nincrease poverty.\r\nMindful of the need to mobilize energy and\r\nincrease capacity in order thoroughly to implement the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action, the least developed\r\ncountries took the initiative of meeting at Cotonou,\r\nfrom 5 to 7 August 2002, in order to consider ways and\r\nmeans of ensuring the implementation of the\r\nProgramme.\r\nThe Cotonou conference formulated guidelines\r\nand made recommendations, contained in the important\r\nCotonou Declaration. At the national level, the\r\nDeclaration recommends the establishment of an\r\nimplementation and follow-up mechanism to monitor\r\nintegration of the Programme of Action into national\r\ndevelopment programmes and to promote the creation\r\nof a national forum for dialogue. It also recommends\r\nthat the least developed countries design their strategic\r\ndevelopment priorities in keeping with local contexts.\r\nThat is an important factor for guaranteeing rationality\r\nand national ownership of policies. At the international\r\nlevel, United Nations and other international agencies\r\nare called on to incorporate the Programme of Action\r\ninto their work programmes and Government\r\nprocesses.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nI believe it important to call attention to the\r\ndangerous dwindling of resources available to the\r\noperational institutions of the United Nations\r\nsystem — particularly the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the\r\nUnited Nations Capital Development Fund, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund and the World Health\r\nOrganization — and to stress the crucial need to find\r\nways and means of increasing those resources in order\r\nto strengthen these agencies’ valuable efforts to combat\r\npoverty in our countries.\r\nThe Cotonou ministerial meeting also\r\nrecommended the establishment of a synoptic table to\r\nbe used by the Economic and Social Council when it\r\nreviews and follows up the implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action by the least developed countries\r\nand their development partners.\r\nI wish at this point to reiterate our gratification\r\nand thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\r\ncelerity with which he implemented the decision taken\r\nby the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session to\r\nestablish the Office of the High Representative for the\r\nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing\r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States. The\r\nSecretary-General nominated Ambassador Chowdhury\r\nof Bangladesh to that important post, which he has\r\nalready assumed. In nominating Ambassador\r\nChowdhury, the Secretary-General could not have\r\nmade a more fortunate choice. We all know\r\nAmbassador Chowdhury and his great experience,\r\nresolve and dedication. His country, Bangladesh, has\r\nserved the group of least developed countries with\r\ndistinction for 20 years. I salute that work today. The\r\nSecretary-General and each one of us must now offer\r\nevery assistance to Ambassador Chowdhury and his\r\nOffice in becoming fully operational and in carrying\r\nout his important mission of obtaining the resources\r\nnecessary for action.\r\nTo that end, it is important that every Member of\r\nthe United Nations, even the poorest, make some\r\neffort, for example, by contributing to the Trust Fund\r\nto support the implementation of the Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action. The Government of Benin will\r\nassume all its responsibilities in that respect in due\r\ncourse.\r\nIn Johannesburg recently, at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, the international community\r\nacknowledged its responsibility to the poor, the\r\nvulnerable and the marginalized as members of the\r\ngreat human family. It also recognized the need to\r\nconclude a world alliance for sustainable development,\r\nby which the developed countries would make the\r\nessential effort of solidarity with the poorest. A giant\r\nstep forward was taken there, but action is now\r\nrequired. We fervently hope today that all the measures\r\nadvocated in Johannesburg will become a reality. If\r\nthey do not, there will be no reduction, but an increase\r\nin poverty. We can stave off that danger, which is\r\ndeadly for all of us.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Emigrants of Lebanon,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Hammoud.\r\nMr. Hammoud (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me pleasure to begin by congratulating\r\nMr. Kavan on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. I wish him every\r\nsuccess as he embarks on this task. I would also like to\r\nthank his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who so ably\r\nsteered the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nsixth session, which was convened amidst acute and\r\ngrave circumstances.\r\nI would be remiss if I failed to express my\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\ntireless work to enhance the role of our international\r\nOrganization.\r\nIt is also my pleasure to congratulate the Swiss\r\nFederation on its admission to membership of our\r\ninternational Organization.\r\nLebanon considers the United Nations to be the\r\nmain body entrusted with the realization of\r\ninternational peace and security and with upholding\r\nrespect for the rules of international law. The United\r\nNations is a safe haven for States, particularly small\r\nones, which find in its Charter the reassurances they\r\nneed in a turbulent world. Therefore, any departure\r\nfrom the Charter, circumventing, disregarding, or\r\noverstepping its authority; any selective handling of its\r\nresolutions; or any attempt to impose settlements on\r\nand solutions to conflicts and disputes outside its\r\nframework flagrantly undermines the credibility of the\r\nOrganization and its organs, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil. Such acts are a devastating blow to the pillars\r\nof international order.\r\nLebanon believes that there is a causal\r\nrelationship between security and sustainable\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\ndevelopment and calls for a renewed effort, under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, to eliminate poverty and\r\ndisease, bridge the gap between the North and the\r\nSouth, and reduce social disparities. These are the\r\nscourges that are often manipulated by those who\r\nharbour ill intentions towards humanity. In this context,\r\nLebanon welcomes the establishment of the African\r\nUnion and supports the principles on which the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development was built.\r\nThe work of this session coincides with the first\r\nanniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks and the\r\nterrible tragedy that struck the United States of\r\nAmerica. The world is still suffering from their terrible\r\nrepercussions. On behalf of Lebanon, I avail myself of\r\nthis opportunity to reiterate our sympathy with the\r\nbereaved families. Like us, they are heartbroken over\r\nthe loss of their sons, relatives and loved ones. We also\r\nrenew our commitment to cooperating with the\r\ninternational community to combat international\r\nterrorism in accordance with the provisions of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001\r\nand other relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe events of 11 September 2001 impeded the\r\nconvening of the ninth summit of the Francophonie,\r\nscheduled to be held last year under the theme of\r\n“Dialogue among civilizations”. My country is proud\r\nto be hosting the conference in mid-October. There is\r\nno doubt that the choice of theme for the conference\r\nbefore these dramatic events arose from the foresight\r\nof its members and participants and from their\r\nconviction of the need to interact and to engage in\r\ndialogue, far removed from the logic of confrontation\r\nand hostility.\r\nLebanon itself was the target of terrorist acts\r\nprior to 11 September 2001 and its army stood up to\r\nthe perpetrators and overcame them. Lebanon and its\r\nArab brothers have been suffering from the State\r\nterrorism continuously practised by Israel without\r\ninternational deterrence since the Deir Yassin massacre\r\nand the massacres in the Qana and Jenin camps.\r\nIsrael has recently begun to manipulate the tragic\r\nevents of September 2001 and the international\r\ncampaign to combat terrorism, using them shamelessly\r\nas a pretext for persecuting the Palestinian people and\r\ndepriving them of their right to self-determination.\r\nIsrael has launched a slanderous campaign of threats\r\nagainst Lebanon and its legitimate resistance, as well\r\nas against Syria, while the origin of the conflict in the\r\nregion is the Israeli occupation of Arab territories.\r\nThe reality is that Israel has continuously defied\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy. Israel has\r\ndisregarded Security Council resolution 425 (1978) for\r\nmore than 22 years and has refused to implement the\r\nSecurity Council resolution calling for the\r\nestablishment of a fact-finding mission to investigate\r\nthe Jenin camp massacre. It has resorted to terror and\r\nviolence to implement expansionist and settlement\r\npolicies. It has accumulated weapons of mass\r\ndestruction in an arsenal primarily stacked with\r\nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons. It continues\r\nto oppose all attempts to reach a just and\r\ncomprehensive peaceful solution to the Middle East\r\nissue, and remains, nonetheless, in total impunity,\r\nnever held accountable or punished for its actions. That\r\nsituation can only strengthen the impression among\r\nArab Governments and peoples that there is a double\r\nstandard at play in international affairs, and that,\r\nregrettably, Israel is allowed to remain outside and\r\nabove the law.\r\nShimon Peres today accused Hezbollah of\r\nterrorism because it has effectively contributed to the\r\nlegitimate resistance against Israeli occupation and to\r\nforcing Israeli forces to withdraw from most occupied\r\nLebanese territory.\r\nHezbollah is represented in Lebanese parliament\r\nand participates in the political, economic and social\r\nlife of Lebanon.\r\nMr. Peres is in fact the last person who should\r\nhave the right to talk about terrorism. He is the one\r\nresponsible directly for the killing of 102 women,\r\nchildren and elderly at Qana when Israel bombed the\r\nUNIFIL tent where they had sought safety and shelter.\r\nIsrael should be held accountable for such crimes.\r\nIsrael was founded on terrorism and has used it to\r\noccupy land and establish faits accomplis.\r\nIf Israel’s perpetration of the massacres of Dair\r\nYasin, Qana and Jenin is not terrorism, then what is\r\nterrorism?\r\nIs not Israel’s daily breaking of the sound barrier\r\nover Lebanese cities and villages a form of terrorism\r\nand intimidation?\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nIs not Israel’s kidnapping of Lebanese citizens\r\nfrom their homes and detaining them in Israeli prisons\r\nas hostages another form of terrorism?\r\nIs not leaving hundreds of thousands of\r\nlandmines in south Lebanon to kill civilians a form of\r\nterrorism that should be strongly condemned?\r\nIs not Israel’s constant threat of invading\r\nLebanon and destroying its civil institutions,\r\ninfrastructure and development projects a terrible form\r\nof terrorism, devastating to our hopes in reconstruction\r\nand rehabilitation?\r\nAs if occupying Arab lands and terrorizing their\r\ncivilian populations were not enough, Israeli greed\r\nprompts Israel to usurp our natural wealth and water\r\nresources, contravening international laws and\r\ninstruments. The Israeli Prime Minister directly\r\nthreatened to attack Lebanon, using the pretext that we\r\nare diverting the course of the Hasbani and Wazzani\r\nrivers. However, the fact is that Lebanon is trying to\r\ndraw limited amounts of water for some poor southern\r\nvillages that have suffered from the Israeli occupation\r\nfor many years, which will lead us to pump a total of\r\napproximately 9 million cubic metres annually. By all\r\nstandards, that amount is far below our legitimate\r\nrights, it represents only one tenth of our right.\r\nLebanon again rejects those Israeli threats and\r\ndraws the attention of the Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil to the danger those threats represent and to\r\ntheir direct negative impact on international peace and\r\nsecurity. It is difficult for any human society to strive\r\nfor security in the absence of political, economic and\r\nsocial justice. We, therefore, believe that security\r\napproaches and partial interim solutions alone cannot\r\npossibly succeed in resolving the Middle East conflict.\r\nTherefore, we call for the adoption of an approach that\r\ntakes into account the priority of the political\r\ndimension of the conflict and the need to arrive at a\r\njust and comprehensive solution to the conflict in the\r\nregion in all its aspects.\r\nIn that context, Arab leaders unanimously\r\nadopted an integral, indivisible peace initiative at the\r\nArab Summit, held in Beirut on 28 and 29 March 2002,\r\nbased on the following conditions.\r\nFirst, Israel must withdraw completely from the\r\noccupied Arab territories, including the occupied\r\nSyrian Golan, to the border of 4 June 1967, and from\r\nthe territories it still occupies in southern Lebanon;\r\nsecondly, it must reach a just solution to the problem of\r\nthe Palestinian refugees, to be agreed upon in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 194\r\n(III); thirdly, it must agree to the establishment of an\r\nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State in the\r\nPalestinian territories occupied since 4 June 1967 in the\r\nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as\r\nits capital.\r\nSubsequently, the Arab States will consider the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict ended, will enter into a peace\r\nagreement with Israel, will ensure security for all the\r\ncountries of the region and will establish normal\r\nrelations with Israel in the context of that just peace. A\r\ncentral element of the Arab peace initiative is securing\r\nan agreement not to allow any type of resettlement of\r\nPalestinian refugees that is incompatible with the\r\nparticularities of the host Arab countries.\r\nIt is unfortunate that Israel has responded to that\r\ninitiative by increasing its aggression and reoccupying\r\nthe West Bank, relentlessly targeting human lives and\r\nproperty in the occupied Palestinian territory.\r\nSimultaneously, others have chosen to ignore or\r\noverride the initiative, despite its comprehensiveness,\r\nunanimous acceptance by Arabs and broad\r\ninternational support.\r\nThe Beirut Summit established a special\r\ncommittee to implement the Arab peace initiative.\r\nOnce formed, the committee requested a meeting with\r\nthe Quartet to present the initiative and confirm its\r\nstatus as a point of reference for the settlement of the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict. The initiative contains all\r\nprevious references dating back to the Madrid Peace\r\nConference, held in 1991, and is based on resolutions\r\nof international legitimacy. We seek to submit it to the\r\nSecurity Council for adoption and for the subsequent\r\nestablishment of an international mechanism to\r\nimplement it.\r\nA meeting was held yesterday between the\r\nQuartet and a delegation of the committee at United\r\nNations Headquarters. We hope that this will pave the\r\nway for a mechanism of prior consultations and joint\r\neffort based on resolutions of international legitimacy\r\nand the Arab peace initiative.\r\nThe Arab peace initiative, which we uphold and\r\nwhich was adopted unanimously by the Arab countries,\r\nrepresents a historic opportunity that may not present\r\nitself again. It cannot be replaced by partial or interim\r\napproaches, the futility of which has been proven\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nthroughout decades. Instead of leading to the long-\r\nawaited peace, they have led to renewed violence. We,\r\ntherefore, call upon the international community to\r\nadopt this initiative and to support it, as it represents an\r\nopportunity for achieving our aspirations — a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\r\nSubmitting disputes before the United Nations\r\nand implementing United Nations resolutions,\r\nparticularly those of the Security Council, can\r\nguarantee the peaceful settlement of any given conflict.\r\nBy following that course, the parties could be spared\r\nthe need to settle their dispute by military means. It\r\nmay not be easy to contain the tragic ramifications of\r\nmilitary action in a given region. That is particularly\r\ntrue of Iraq, which also was the subject of deliberations\r\nat the Beirut Arab Summit. It was also decided there\r\nthat the solution to the Iraqi problem must be achieved\r\nthrough dialogue between Iraq and the United Nations.\r\nIraq should not once again be a theatre of war, which\r\nwould increase the suffering of its people. The Arab\r\nleaders consider an attack against any Arab State a\r\nthreat to the national security of all Arab countries.\r\nAs president of the Arab Summit, Lebanon hopes\r\nthat Iraq’s compliance with the will of the international\r\ncommunity and allowing the return of the international\r\nweapons inspectors will lead to the end of the suffering\r\nof its people and to a comprehensive solution that will\r\nlead to the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions and to the lifting of sanctions. We also hope\r\nthat that will enable the Middle East to rid itself of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and will avert the threat\r\nor use of force against Iraq, thus preserving and\r\nrespecting its sovereignty, independence and territorial\r\nintegrity.\r\nLebanon takes pride in its strong and positive\r\nrelationship with the United Nations, being one of its\r\nco-founders and having contributed to the drafting of\r\nits Charter as well as to the drafting of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. As members may be\r\naware, since 1978, the Organization has deployed the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in\r\nthe aftermath of the Israeli occupation. In May 2000,\r\nUNIFIL had the opportunity to begin fulfilling its\r\nmandate after Israel had been forced to withdraw from\r\nmost of the territories in the south. That withdrawal\r\nwas possible thanks to our people’s solidarity, their\r\nlegitimate resistance to the Israeli occupation and the\r\nfact that our Government embraced their heroic efforts\r\nfor liberation, and the international support for their\r\njust cause. The Lebanese Shebaa Farms, at the foot of\r\nMount Hermon, and other points along the withdrawal\r\nline remained under occupation.\r\nAnother important aspect of UNIFIL’s mandate\r\nthat has yet to be fulfilled is the restoration of\r\ninternational peace and security. That task remains\r\nhampered by Israel’s continued occupation, threats\r\nagainst Lebanon and provocations, as seen daily in the\r\nrepeated violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty over its\r\nland, airspace and territorial waters. Israel continues to\r\noccupy the Syrian Golan and to ignore the right of\r\nPalestinian refugees to return to their homes. It has\r\nrejected every initiative to find a just and\r\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East problem. I\r\nshould like to take advantage of this opportunity to\r\ncommend the efforts of the United Nations and\r\nUNIFIL’s important role as it fulfils its mandate.\r\nThe liberation of Lebanese territories from Israeli\r\noccupation will remain incomplete unless we address\r\nthe heinous legacy of occupation and succeed in\r\nfinding a just solution to the problem of Palestinian\r\nrefugees, in particular those who live in Lebanon. Such\r\na solution should be based on their right to return and\r\non a rejection of their settlement in Lebanon. Failure to\r\nfactor the refugees into the equation of a solution based\r\non the right to return and on the rejection of\r\nresettlement in host countries would create a time\r\nbomb. It would undermine the security that we are all\r\nstriving to attain in the Middle East on the basis of a\r\npeaceful, comprehensive and just settlement of the\r\nconflict.\r\nWe should like to stress here that a solution to the\r\nquestion of Palestinian refugees cannot be found\r\nthrough exclusive bilateral Palestinian-Israeli\r\nnegotiations. Guaranteed respect for the rules of\r\ninternational law and the permanence of any solution\r\nrequire that host and other concerned countries,\r\nincluding Lebanon, be involved in the negotiating\r\nprocess.\r\nWith regard to mine clearance, Lebanon is\r\nstepping up its cooperation with the United Nations to\r\nassist in clearing the mines that the Israeli occupying\r\nforces are responsible for laying in our territories. I\r\nwill note that Israel failed to hand over complete maps\r\nand records indicating the specific locations of those\r\nmines.\r\nWe in Lebanon attach the highest importance to\r\nthe release of Lebanese citizens who are unduly\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\ndetained in Israeli prisons. They were kidnapped by\r\nIsrael and incarcerated as hostages, in flagrant defiance\r\nof the rules and instruments of international law.\r\nIt is no secret that the Israeli occupation of\r\nsouthern Lebanon has taxed our endurance. Our\r\ncitizens’ lives have been tragically shattered, their\r\nproperties have been destroyed, their infrastructures\r\nhave been decimated and our development has been\r\nhampered. Increased international assistance is\r\nrequired to revitalize our economy and to increase our\r\nopportunities for growth. Lebanon reserves the right to\r\ndemand compensation for the damage caused by Israeli\r\noccupation and acts of aggression, in accordance with\r\nestablished procedures in international political and\r\njudicial forums.\r\nThe reconstruction and rehabilitation of the\r\nliberated Lebanese territories and the revitalization of\r\nLebanon’s economy are among our Government’s\r\nhighest priorities. Lebanon continues to work for the\r\nrecovery of its economy and for the reform of its\r\ntaxation system through the adoption of carefully\r\ndeveloped measures and legislation, including the\r\nvalue-added tax on goods and services and the gradual\r\nreduction of tariffs, in addition to the direct tax levy\r\nand the rationalization of spending. Lebanon’s\r\nparliament recently adopted the Privatization Act,\r\nwhich regulates that aspect of economic activity and\r\ndefines its conditions and field of application. Such\r\nlegislation, including the two recently adopted acts,\r\njoins a series of laws developed to enhance investors’\r\nconfidence in the free-market system, which we are\r\nkeen to preserve.\r\nAlong the same lines, those in positions of\r\nresponsibility in the Lebanese Administration are\r\nsubject to strict accountability and liability rules,\r\nincluding money-laundering and the prohibition of\r\nillegitimate gain. It is worth mentioning here that, over\r\nthe years, the Lebanese internal security forces have\r\ndestroyed all illegitimate crops, including hashish. But\r\nLebanon did not receive the assistance, provided to\r\nothers, that would have enabled our farmers to live in\r\ndignity.\r\nLebanon signed a partnership agreement with the\r\nEuropean Union last June after acceding to the Greater\r\nArab Free Trade Zone, to which most Arab States\r\ncurrently belong. Preparations are under way for us to\r\njoin the World Trade Organization, in which we\r\ncurrently enjoy observer status.\r\nWe gather here under the roof of the United\r\nNations, our common home, to engage in dialogue on\r\nthe best ways to translate into reality the great values\r\nof the Charter. Lebanon takes pride in its firm belief in\r\nthose values and in the fact that, in its national unity, it\r\nembodies the plurality of its society. It stands for a rich\r\nhuman experience, both civilized and pioneering, of\r\nwhich we are proud and which the international\r\ncommunity is surely keen to preserve.\r\nLebanon looks forward to cooperating with other\r\nMembers to contribute to this session’s success and to\r\nfinding constructive solutions to the problems and\r\nchallenges that we face, while upholding the principles\r\nof liberty, justice and peace around the world,\r\nparticularly in the Middle East region. Finding a just\r\nand comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict\r\nin all its aspects will surely liberate our States and\r\npeoples from the grip of a protracted problem that has\r\ndepleted their resources and hampered their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe President: Once again, I appeal to\r\neverybody to limit their statements to the agreed 15\r\nminutes, which also applies to this afternoon’s meeting.\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Stafford Neil, chairman of the delegation of\r\nJamaica.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): On behalf of the delegation\r\nof Jamaica, I express congratulations to you, Sir, on\r\nyour assumption of the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We pledge our\r\nfull cooperation with you in the work of this session.\r\nWe also express our deep gratitude to the outgoing\r\nPresident, Mr. Han Seung-soo, under whose guidance\r\nthe fifty-sixth session was successfully completed.\r\nJamaica welcomes the Swiss Confederation as a\r\nMember of the family of the United Nations, and we\r\nlook forward to welcoming East Timor when it\r\nassumes membership in the Organization later during\r\nthis session.\r\nForty years ago on this day, 18 September,\r\nJamaica joined the family of the United Nations as its\r\n106th member. It was one of our first foreign policy\r\ninitiatives upon achieving independence. In taking that\r\nstep, Jamaica signalled its readiness to assume its\r\nobligations as a member of the international\r\ncommunity and to contribute to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and to the promotion\r\n31\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nof economic and social progress through multilateral\r\ncooperation within the United Nations system. Today,\r\non its fortieth anniversary, Jamaica reaffirms its faith in\r\nthe United Nations and proclaims its unwavering\r\ncommitment to multilateralism.\r\nOver its 40 years Jamaica has played its part\r\nthrough active participation in widening the reach of\r\nthe United Nations into a range of activities and\r\nprogrammes critical to global development and world\r\npeace. Our policy is to support the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system and to uphold its moral\r\nauthority. In a world of many nations with diverse\r\ninterests and of great disparities in wealth and military\r\npower, it is an indispensable instrument in the\r\npromotion of the rule of law in international affairs and\r\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nWith the changing nature and growing complexity\r\nof international affairs, especially in the context of\r\nglobalization and with the emergence of new\r\nchallenges to peace and security, the fulfilment of the\r\nUnited Nations’ role remains critical. Now, more than\r\never before, we need to strengthen the structures and\r\ninstitutions of the international system to safeguard our\r\ncommon interests in achieving a global order of peace\r\nand economic and social progress for all.\r\nOver the past year, dramatic events have occurred\r\nwhich have brought old and new issues to the forefront\r\nof attention. We recall the shock and horror of the\r\nterrorist attacks on 11 September; the ensuing war in\r\nAfghanistan; the outbreak of renewed violence in the\r\nMiddle East between Israelis and Palestinians; the\r\nescalation of old tensions in South Asia; and more\r\nrecently, the threat of a new war in Iraq. All of these\r\nwere given special attention by the Secretary-General\r\nin the presentation of his report to the General\r\nAssembly last Thursday. Jamaica commends the\r\nSecretary-General for the clarity of his vision on the\r\nrole of the United Nations in the resolution of current\r\nglobal problems.\r\nOf high importance on the agenda for immediate\r\naction is the situation in the Middle East, where\r\nrecently we have witnessed so much death, destruction\r\nand human suffering, particularly among civilians. It\r\nshould now be clear that the only true way to find\r\npeace and security is through laying the foundations for\r\na just and durable settlement. What is needed now is a\r\nplan to move the process forward towards the\r\nconvening of a peace conference. There has emerged a\r\nsignificant level of consensus on the main elements of\r\na settlement — the withdrawal of Israel from occupied\r\nPalestinian territory; the exercise of self-determination\r\nfor the Palestinian people and the establishment of\r\narrangements for the two States of Israel and Palestine\r\nto coexist within clearly defined and internationally\r\nrecognized boundaries. We believe it is important and\r\nurgent that advantage is taken of the present situation\r\nof relative calm to proceed towards negotiations\r\ninvolving the leadership of Israel and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority.\r\nWith regard to Iraq, which has been the subject of\r\nso much debate in recent weeks, it is up to the Security\r\nCouncil to carry out its responsibilities in a manner\r\nbroadly acceptable to the international community and\r\nto preclude unilateral actions that could lead to\r\nunpredictable consequences and to wider instability in\r\nthe region. This is an important moment for the United\r\nNations, and we expect the Security Council to act in\r\naccordance with the Charter to safeguard the integrity\r\nof the international system and to ensure the\r\nmaintenance of peace.\r\nTo make the world a safer place requires\r\nmeasures to be adopted on a broad front. The\r\nelimination of terrorism is a task requiring cooperation\r\nby the entire international community. The\r\ncomprehensive measures set out in Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) establish the framework for\r\naction, and Jamaica is doing its part in that effort. At\r\nthe same time, it should be recognized that for\r\nachievement of the long-term objectives, it is necessary\r\nto address the root causes of terrorism in their political,\r\neconomic, social and psychological dimensions. It is\r\nalso important that, in the campaign against terrorism,\r\nthere should be no targeting or stigmatizing of\r\nparticular ethnic groups or religious communities; nor\r\nshould it become the basis for intolerance, persecution\r\nor discrimination against minority groups or for the\r\nviolation of human rights.\r\nLinked to the question of terrorism are security\r\nproblems arising from the continued growth in the\r\nillicit trade in narcotics and the illicit transfer of guns\r\nand other weapons which have become inseparable\r\nelements in the operations of transnational crime. This\r\nis particularly the case in the Caribbean, where this\r\nphenomenon has assumed alarming proportions in the\r\nera of globalization. A growing network of illicit trade\r\nhas developed in drugs and weapons, which is\r\nsubverting the internal security of our Caribbean States\r\n32\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nand threatening social stability. We acknowledge\r\nongoing efforts at the regional and bilateral levels to\r\naddress these security concerns, but more needs to be\r\ndone, particularly in regulating, monitoring and\r\nreporting transfers in small arms in jurisdictions in\r\nwhich these weapons are produced.\r\nThese are some of the negative features that\r\naccompany globalization and add to the problems\r\nfacing developing countries. The globalization of trade,\r\nfinance and the means of production presents even\r\ngreater challenges. The contraction of overall\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and foreign direct\r\ninvestment flows, and the volatility in short-term\r\ncapital flows, have resulted over time in declining\r\ngrowth rates and increasing poverty, thus widening the\r\ngap between rich and poor countries. The opportunities\r\nfor economic growth and prosperity promised by\r\nglobalization have, therefore, not materialized for the\r\nmajority. Instead, developing countries have been\r\nplaced in peril in a system in which survival will\r\nremain an uphill struggle against dislocation and\r\nmarginalization. Without some arrangement to promote\r\ngreater equity in the sharing of the benefits of\r\nglobalization, we will witness a pattern of continued\r\nenrichment of only those endowed with the resources,\r\ncapital stocks and technology, who can reap the\r\nadvantages of competitiveness.\r\nIn this context, the very important forums held\r\nduring the past year, which sought to advance the\r\ndevelopment agenda, were both timely and welcome.\r\nAt Doha last November, there was some\r\nacknowledgement of the wide differences in levels of\r\ndevelopment and capacity of States, and the\r\nconsequential need for special and differential\r\ntreatment for developing countries. We look forward to\r\nhaving these principles incorporated into the\r\narchitecture of World Trade Organization rules. This,\r\nfor us, would be an important step in pursuing a\r\ndevelopment dimension within the trade agenda. Since\r\ntrade is the engine of development, it is vital that real\r\nopportunities be made available in export markets for\r\ndeveloping country products, without the barriers, in\r\nvarious forms, which continue to hamper market access\r\nand restrict the expansion of exports.\r\nThere should also be significant strengthening of\r\nproductive capacity through new investment and\r\ncapital transfers to developing countries. At Monterrey\r\nin March, we sought to put in place a framework for\r\nthe more effective mobilization of resources for\r\ndevelopment from many critical sources. Some\r\nindications were given of ODA increases, which we\r\nwelcome, although these still fall below the agreed\r\ntargets. In the absence of a system of global\r\ngovernance that would assure equity in investment\r\nopportunity and protection from the volatility of\r\nprivate financial flows, official sources of finance\r\nremain a critical form of development assistance. It is,\r\ntherefore, important that these new resources are made\r\navailable to achieve concrete results without the\r\ncomplications of conditionalities and selective\r\nprocessing.\r\nAs we pursue implementation of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus and the Doha Agenda, we also look forward\r\nto progress in the democratization of the decision-\r\nmaking process within the international system for\r\nfinance and trade. For it is only when developing\r\ncountries are accorded fair space and an effective voice\r\nin the setting of international finance and trade policies\r\nthat we will begin to see greater equity in the\r\ndistribution of the world’s wealth.\r\nMost recently, in Johannesburg, we embraced a\r\nnew opportunity to advance the sustainable\r\ndevelopment agenda by furthering progress in the\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. We welcome the\r\nimportant new targets agreed, which give fuller\r\nexpression to the commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\nreal test will be to see whether the commitments are\r\ntranslated into action, through the mobilization of\r\nresources, to meet the requirements of the programme\r\nand the targets that have been set. Johannesburg is thus\r\nthe climax of an important year that reshaped and\r\nrefocused the development priorities of the global\r\ncommunity for the new millennium. For sustainable\r\ndevelopment will not be achieved without financing for\r\ndevelopment, nor without a development agenda in\r\ntrade. Jamaica welcomes in particular the commitments\r\nmade at Johannesburg in respect of small island\r\ndeveloping States (SIDS). We continue to underscore\r\nthe need for special attention to be paid to the\r\nchallenges of vulnerability faced by SIDS. What is\r\nneeded is a fair opportunity to secure the welfare of our\r\npeople, and to protect our fragile environment.\r\nThis cannot be achieved without the full support\r\nof the international community. The Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action, adopted in 1994, represented\r\nthat commitment of support. As we now prepare to\r\nreview its implementation in 2004, we encourage\r\n33\r\nA/57/PV.14\r\nrenewed engagement on those issues critical to our\r\nvery survival, such as the dangers posed by global\r\nwarming, sea level rise and natural disasters.\r\nJamaica welcomes the positive indications for\r\nAfrica, where the reduction of political conflict and\r\nturmoil offers a real opportunity for building stability\r\nand economic progress. Africa has suffered for far too\r\nlong from a myriad of difficult problems and should be\r\ngiven a new start.\r\nThe formation of the African Union and the\r\ninauguration of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) are commendable initiatives\r\naimed at bringing Africa closer to the mainstream of\r\ninternational development, at containing the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic and at combating the spread of poverty. What\r\nare really needed now are resources and we urge that\r\nevery effort be made to ensure that the new initiatives\r\nachieve a breakthrough for African development.\r\nIn the field of social development and human\r\nrights, the United Nations has made significant\r\nachievements in extending and promoting the rights of\r\npersons in vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.\r\nNotwithstanding those achievements, the Organization\r\nis faced with growing social challenges, including the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, which threaten to reverse\r\ndecades of progress in many parts of the world.\r\nConcerted action to control the spread of this disease\r\nshould remain a priority of the Organization. So too\r\nshould be the protection of the rights of children. The\r\nspecific time-bound targets adopted during the special\r\nsession on children require our unequivocal\r\ncommitment.\r\nOne of the important areas of contribution on the\r\npart of the United Nations is in the development of\r\ninternational law as a means of promoting universally\r\naccepted rules and the creation of multilateral legal\r\nregimes to achieve common goals. The most recent\r\nachievement is the Rome Statute on the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC), which came into force in July\r\n2002.\r\nAnother outstanding example is the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This year,\r\nthe international community will be observing the 20th\r\nAnniversary of its signing, which took place at\r\nMontego Bay, Jamaica on 10 December 1982. The\r\nimmense significance of this Convention in\r\nsafeguarding the interests of all countries, in the\r\nexploitation of ocean resources, and in maritime issues\r\nhas been widely acknowledged.\r\nWe applaud the work being carried out by the two\r\ninstitutions that have evolved out of the Convention —\r\nthe International Seabed Authority (ISA), which is\r\nentrusted with the implementation of the concept of the\r\ncommon heritage of mankind, and the International\r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, which is the forum for\r\nresolving maritime disputes under the Convention.\r\nThis is a good example of the result of working\r\ntogether to achieve common solutions through a\r\nmultilateral process to advance the common interest. It\r\nshows that the United Nations is working. We should\r\nsafeguard and strengthen it as the guardian of our\r\ncommon future.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.\r\n"
