(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Al-Nasser\r\n(Qatar), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Ranil\r\nWickremesinghe, Prime Minister of the\r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear a statement made by\r\nthe Prime Minister of the Democratic Socialist\r\nRepublic of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Sri Lanka, was escorted\r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency the Honourable Ranil\r\nWickremesinghe, Prime Minster of the Democratic\r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Wickremesinghe (Sri Lanka): Let me begin\r\nby conveying, on behalf of the Sri Lanka delegation,\r\nour sincere felicitations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his\r\nelection as President of this fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and our assurances of our fullest\r\ncooperation.\r\nI would also like to express appreciation for the\r\nexemplary manner in which Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\nformer Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nKorea, guided the work of the fifty-sixth session. We\r\nalso warmly welcome Switzerland as a new Member of\r\nthe Organization, and look forward also to welcoming\r\nEast Timor.\r\nOur discussions and debates in this Assembly\r\noften reach great heights and seek grand objectives, but\r\nultimately they are about the future lives, well-being\r\nand security of the people we are privileged to\r\nrepresent. It is with such thoughts in my mind that I\r\nrecall the horrendous events of 11 September 2001,\r\nwhich claimed the lives of so many Americans and\r\npeople of other nationalities from all over the world.\r\nAs we are only too painfully aware, they are not the\r\nonly victims of terror.\r\nThe attack confirmed what we in Sri Lanka have\r\nlong known: terrorism has long been globalized. As\r\nPresident Bush acknowledged on 11 March 2002,\r\n“September 11 was not the beginning of global terror,\r\nbut it was the beginning of the world’s concerted\r\nresponse.”\r\nWe in Sri Lanka perhaps know better than most\r\nthe tragedies that conflict and terrorism create. My own\r\ncountry has been ravaged by a 20-year conflict, which\r\nhas caused more than 65,000 deaths. Eight hundred\r\nthousand people are internally displaced. Tragic stories\r\nabound: children who will never see their fathers return\r\nhome; mothers who have lost their sons; and children\r\nwho, even today, innocently step on anti-personnel\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nmines. I have talked to the disabled soldiers and the\r\ndispossessed, the people who have no homes, and those\r\nwho return to the north-east of our country to find war-\r\ntorn ruins and once productive fields sown with land\r\nmines.\r\nThe election victory last December of the\r\nGovernment I represent was a clear national mandate to\r\nend the conflict in the north-east. The Government has\r\nsince moved swiftly towards the fulfilment of that\r\nmandate. A ceasefire with the Liberation Tigers of\r\nTamil Eelam (LTTE) was signed on 22 February this\r\nyear. The ceasefire has held.\r\nConfidence-building measures have encouraged\r\nthe free movement of people throughout the country\r\nand have revived economic activity. Peace talks with\r\nthe LTTE, facilitated by Norway, began two days ago\r\nin Sattahip, Thailand. The Sri Lanka Government has\r\nunilaterally suspended the proscription of the LTTE in\r\norder to facilitate the talks, to give peace a chance, and\r\nto give the LTTE a chance for peace.\r\nA flexible approach is necessary in the\r\nnegotiations, combining a warm heart with a cool head.\r\nAn understanding of the other side, their aspirations\r\nand their concerns, is essential. Negotiations are\r\ncomplex and will take time. In the early stages of our\r\ntalks with the LTTE, we are trying to resolve some of\r\nthe immediate practical needs of the people in order to\r\nbring relief and normalcy to our society. Economic\r\nreconstruction and development of the affected areas\r\nwill be a deciding factor in sustaining the momentum\r\nof political negotiations. Development is part of the\r\nhealing process in a wounded, divided society. The\r\npressing day-to-day problems of the people need to be\r\nsettled as soon as possible.\r\nIndeed, at the discussions in Thailand, there was\r\nstrong endorsement of the urgent need for resources to\r\nensure the early dividends of the peace process. The\r\nrole played by Norway in facilitating that process and,\r\nmost recently, at the peace talks is deeply appreciated. I\r\nextend my sincere thanks to Norway for all its efforts.\r\nAlready, following the ceasefire, there are signs\r\nof people enjoying their rediscovered freedom. The\r\npeople want more. Exchange visits between school\r\nchildren and other groups from the south and from the\r\nnorth have revealed to many that the other side is not\r\nso different after all. Last week our capital, Colombo,\r\ncame to a standstill as people from all over the country,\r\nfrom every religion and every ethnic group in society,\r\nflocked to a peace rally.\r\nThose are all encouraging signs. But with them\r\ncomes a risk. The imperative of peace is growing. The\r\npeople demand peace, and the politicians and\r\nnegotiators on both sides had better deliver. Peace is\r\npeople-driven. The conflict had dragged our economy\r\nto near bankruptcy, and last year, for the first time in\r\nindependent Sri Lanka, we recorded negative growth.\r\nResources must flow into developing the areas ravaged\r\nby war. Opportunities must be created. The momentum\r\nof growth must be re-established. The people want to\r\nsee normalcy restored, not tomorrow but today. The\r\nfarmers want their damaged irrigation canals repaired\r\ntoday; their harvest cannot be delayed until a final\r\nagreement is reached. This imperative is driven even\r\nmore by young people among the Sri Lankan armed\r\nforces and the cadres of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\r\nEelam, whose weapons lie silent. Without international\r\nsupport and help with resources to build a peace\r\ndividend, the gloss on peace can be dulled. With the\r\nrecreation of opportunities for people and for growth,\r\npoliticians and negotiators will be driven even harder\r\nto stabilize, advance and sustain the peace.\r\nFrom there, we can approach the complex\r\nconstitutional issues. Those questions will take time.\r\nWe believe that the way forward is through a clearly\r\nrepresentative interim administration within a united\r\nSri Lanka in which the rights of all communities,\r\nTamil, Muslim and Sinhalese, are safeguarded. That\r\nwill allow us to carry forward an initiative to empower\r\nlocal people by decentralizing governmental authority\r\nand by establishing five regional economic\r\ndevelopment zones. Through such initiatives, we intend\r\nto encourage local people to be responsible for driving\r\neconomic growth in their own regions. Those\r\nmeasures, along with the liberalization and\r\nderegulation of our economy, will generate wealth.\r\nMeanwhile, there is a pressing, immediate\r\nsecurity issue. Hundreds of thousands of mines need to\r\nbe removed from tracts of land to make them safe and\r\narable in order for the internally displaced persons to\r\nreturn to their homes and their farms. Sri Lanka is\r\nreviewing its position on the Ottawa Convention on\r\nanti-personnel mines with a view to becoming a party\r\nto it as confidence in peace grows. We are grateful for\r\nthe help we are receiving from the United Nations,\r\nmembers of the international community and non-\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\ngovernmental organizations in our demining\r\nprogramme.\r\nMy Government is resolved to ensure that the\r\npeople of the north and east of our Republic should\r\nalso enjoy the same security and the same quality of\r\nlife, democratic governance and human rights which\r\npeople in other parts of the country enjoy. Sri Lanka\r\nhas a high rating on the Human Development Index of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\r\nOur per capita income figures and our life expectancy\r\nand our literacy rates are among the highest in the\r\nregion. Peace will further enhance all that, but its\r\ndividend must be credited to all the shareholders in Sri\r\nLanka’s future.\r\nSri Lanka welcomes the support that our peace\r\nprocess has received from members of the international\r\ncommunity and from the United Nations. On a request\r\nmade by me to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a United\r\nNations inter-agency needs assessment team visited Sri\r\nLanka in April and May of this year. The team\r\ncompleted a strategic overview of the current situation,\r\nwhich can guide immediate and mid- to long-term\r\naction by United Nations agencies in Sri Lanka. We\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his efforts.\r\nQuickening the pace of peace and having its\r\ndividends credited directly and urgently to the people\r\nare imperative. We are grateful to all those who are\r\nassisting us in Quick Impact Projects. The\r\nimplementation of those projects without delay will\r\nhelp peace take root, involve people in the affected\r\nareas in their economic and social recovery and ease\r\nthe way for higher stages of development.\r\nThroughout its long history, there have been\r\nflattering descriptions of Sri Lanka — centuries before\r\nour Tourist Board promoted the serenity of the island.\r\nThe ancient Arabs and mediaeval Europeans called our\r\nisland paradise. If in the course of our recent conflict\r\nsome of the quality of paradise has been lost, then\r\nsurely paradise must be regained. Regaining Sri Lanka\r\nis much more than a slogan, it is a practical, doable\r\nstrategy, in which we invite the international\r\ncommunity to participate.\r\nWhile seeking a negotiated solution to our own\r\nconflict, Sri Lanka strongly supports negotiating a\r\nsettlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. We have\r\nlong supported a responsible peace process which\r\nwould lead to the acceptance of two States, Israel and\r\nPalestine, prospering in conditions of peace and\r\nsecurity, as neighbours, within secure and recognized\r\nborders. We urge the resumption of a serious dialogue\r\nbetween Israel and Palestine as a prelude to sustained\r\nnegotiations.\r\nIn Sri Lanka, dialogue and negotiations are\r\nturning around a long, drawn-out conflict. With respect\r\nto those who were responsible for 11 September, the\r\napproach needs to be different. No cause justifies the\r\nkilling of innocent people. Global terrorism must be\r\neradicated, whatever its manifestation and wherever it\r\noccurs. We support a comprehensive approach to\r\ninternational terrorism through the General Assembly’s\r\nAd Hoc Committee on Terrorism. Terrorism has\r\naffected virtually all the countries of South Asia. A\r\nmeeting in Sri Lanka will soon draft an additional\r\nprotocol to the Regional Convention on Suppression of\r\nTerrorism of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation. The protocol would update the\r\nConvention, inter alia to meet the obligations\r\ndevolving on member States in respect of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism.\r\nThe United Nations has been a source of good\r\nsince its inception. It is the forum in which there is an\r\nopportunity for interaction and possible reconciliation\r\namong complex, competing and even confrontational\r\nconcerns. Under the Secretary-General’s initiative of\r\nthe Global Compact, it provides for the launching and\r\nnavigation of positive partnerships between the\r\ncorporate and State sectors.\r\nWe also look forward to the implementation of\r\ndecisions taken at the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, held in Monterrey. We\r\nwelcome the Millennium Challenge Account as an\r\noutcome of that Conference to assist countries\r\ncommitted to democratic norms and good governance,\r\nto the engagement of the private sector and to the\r\ninvolvement of the people in the process of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn Sri Lanka, we intend to re-establish an\r\ninvestment-friendly country with an efficient\r\nbureaucracy and a thriving private sector. On this visit\r\nto the United States, I have brought a team from my\r\nindustrial sector to talk to United States businessmen.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for helping my\r\nGovernment to organize an investment promotion\r\nforum in the United States tomorrow with the\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nparticipation of members of our private sector, who\r\nwill interact with their counterparts here. Those “close\r\nencounters of the business kind” will provide insight\r\ninto the opportunities for collaborative economic and\r\ndevelopment ventures in Sri Lanka as we move\r\nforward on the peace front. Investment in peace makes\r\nsound political and economic sense for both Sri Lanka\r\nand its partners abroad. Growth in Sri Lanka will be\r\ngood for everyone.\r\nAcross Sri Lanka, the people continue to build\r\nthe only true peace we can hope for. Without fanfare,\r\nwithout politicians or media, they are quietly going\r\nabout their business, finding old friends and building\r\nnew relationships. Mistrust and suspicion are slowly\r\nmelting away as people talk and share past experiences.\r\nThe hatred in some hearts will take a little longer to\r\ndispel. But even that will be overcome in time by the\r\ndeep desire for weapons to be destroyed, mines to be\r\ncleared and the sound of laughter to be heard once\r\nagain.\r\nTrusting the people, whether it be for the\r\nconsolidation of peace or the pursuit of development, is\r\nthe best policy. We are beholden to the people we work\r\nfor, whether they be clients or customers or\r\nshareholders or voters.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of Sri Lanka for the statement he just\r\nmade.\r\nThe Honourable Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime\r\nMinister of Sri Lanka, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. M. Morshed Khan, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh.\r\nMr. Khan (Bangladesh): May I begin by\r\nextending my warm congratulations to the President\r\nupon his election. We have every confidence that his\r\nstewardship of our proceedings will yield fruitful\r\nresults. Credit is due also to his predecessor, Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo, for his deft handling of our affairs. We also\r\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\r\nleadership he has shown during the past year across a\r\nvery broad range of subjects. His inaugural remarks,\r\nwhich have set the tone for our deliberations, are truly\r\npraiseworthy. We welcome two new Members this\r\nyear, Switzerland and, soon, East Timor. We look\r\nforward to working closely with them.\r\nAs we are all painfully aware, this has been a\r\nvery difficult year. The day of 11 September 2001\r\nwitnessed a dastardly act of barbaric terrorism. It also\r\nunited peace-loving peoples all over the world as never\r\nbefore. As we continue our struggle to prevent the\r\nresurgence of such atrocities, we must also address\r\nourselves seriously to the task of rooting out the causes\r\nthat spawn such behaviour. Any action in that respect\r\nshould be based on the widest possible international\r\nconsensus-building through consultations.\r\nBangladesh has been and shall always be a\r\ncommitted and active partner in the coalition against\r\nterrorism. We have taken every necessary step to share\r\ninformation and assist in the curbing of terror. We have\r\nsought to implement Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), which we ourselves helped to draft and adopt\r\nlast year as a member of the Council. At the regional\r\nlevel, we are currently examining ways and means of\r\nfurther strengthening the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Convention\r\non Suppression of Terrorism. Terror is totally\r\nunconnected to any faith or region. It is a global\r\nphenomenon that needs to be tackled by means that are\r\nboth legitimate and consensual.\r\nThose methods include the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and democratic values, respect for human\r\nrights and the rule of law, the peaceful resolution of\r\nconflicts, peace-building, cooperation towards\r\nequitable economic development, the eradication of\r\npoverty, gender equality, measures aimed at\r\nconfidence-building, mutual respect among races and\r\npeoples, and harmony — not clashes — between\r\ncultures. Those are the main pillars on which we must\r\nbuild a world where hope will reign in place of despair.\r\nIn the construction of this edifice, the architect must be\r\nthe United Nations — which, with its Charter\r\nprinciples and purposes — is the greatest institution\r\ncrafted by humankind.\r\nBangladesh is relentless in the pursuit of those\r\ngoals, both nationally and internationally. Our\r\nproblems, as all are aware, are many and varied. Of\r\nroughly the size of the state of Wisconsin in the United\r\nStates, we have a population of 130 million people,\r\nwhich makes us one of the largest nations in the world.\r\nCenturies of colonial exploitation left us with\r\ninadequate infrastructure and resources, and\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nconstrained us in the trap of poverty. Subject to the\r\nvagaries of nature, our economy was a gamble in\r\nmonsoons. Soon after our independence, in 1971, we\r\nwere perceived as an irredeemable basket case.\r\nSince then, we have come a long way. We have\r\ndedicated ourselves wholeheartedly to improving the\r\nquality of life of our people and to their development.\r\nOur policies were grounded in certain values dear to\r\nour hearts. We have acted in the firm belief that\r\ndevelopment is possible only against a matrix of\r\ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law; that\r\nstructures and institutions in society must be inclusive,\r\nparticipatory and accountable; and that growth must be\r\npro-poor, pro-environment, pro-equity and pro-women.\r\nIn our view, tolerance among religions and an\r\nappreciation of differing opinions must be imbedded in\r\nthe social psyche. Our rich intellectual heritage and\r\ncultural tradition have been the source of home-grown\r\ninnovative ideas such as micro-credit and special\r\neducational projects that have enabled us to initiate the\r\nquiet revolution in our society that has led to a process\r\nof huge societal transformation.\r\nAs a result, we have been able to achieve many\r\nsuccesses, which have been widely acclaimed. Despite\r\nour being a traditional society, through effective family\r\nplanning programmes we were able to cut the\r\npopulation growth rate by 50 per cent over the last two\r\ndecades. In agriculture, we now produce sufficient food\r\ngrains to feed our entire people. We have invested\r\nheavily in human resources development and have\r\nprovided massive budgetary allocations for primary\r\nand secondary education. Schooling up to twelfth grade\r\nis free for girl students, and all are awarded stipends.\r\nGender mainstreaming is a major policy thrust. In\r\nBangladesh the empowerment of women receives the\r\nhighest priority. This is achieved mainly through\r\ninitiatives such as special provisions for education for\r\ngirl children, employment of women in the garment\r\nindustry, and micro-credit schemes that generate self-\r\nemployment for women. Global recognition of these\r\nendeavours was manifest in our recent election to the\r\nCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination\r\nagainst Women.\r\nExcellent cooperation exists between the\r\nGovernment and civil society. Bangladesh hosts some\r\nof the world’s largest and most active non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. In our development\r\nprocess, we are ourselves in the driver’s seat. A mix of\r\nappropriate macro-economic policies and effective\r\nutilization of external assistance has vastly reduced our\r\ndependence on foreign aid. A document at the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, held at Monterrey, entitled “Successful\r\ndevelopment: models for the twenty-first century” says\r\nthat\r\n“The lesson in Bangladesh is that official\r\ndevelopment assistance, when applied in\r\nconjunction with a country’s efforts to resolve its\r\nown development challenges, can yield dramatic\r\nresults.”\r\nToday what we seek is not compassion, largesse or\r\ncharity, but greater market access for our manufactured\r\nproducts, fairer trade and more investment. We may\r\nstill have a long way to go, but we believe we are on\r\nthe right track.\r\nAt the international level, we are striving to\r\nreinforce mutually beneficial and cooperative relations\r\nwith all countries. We are seeking, in concert with our\r\ndevelopment partners, to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The special efforts made, and the\r\nsuccesses achieved, in Monterrey, Johannesburg and at\r\nthe special session on children have given us cause for\r\nhope. It is now important for all of us to seriously get\r\ndown to implementing the promises made and to\r\nachieving the targets set. We are happy that our image\r\nabroad is one of a responsible, politically stable,\r\nmoderate, democratic and constructive member of the\r\ninternational community. We have actively engaged our\r\nneighbours in the development of cooperation and\r\nunderstanding. As the Assembly will recall, it was\r\nPresident Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh who first\r\nconceived of the concept of the South Asian\r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation. Today, our\r\nPrime Minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, is also committed\r\nto bringing the Asian cooperation dialogue to fruition.\r\nAs a demonstration of our commitment to global\r\nstability and peace, we have voluntarily given up the\r\nnuclear option and joined the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We actively\r\nparticipate in peacekeeping operations, and are\r\ncurrently one of the largest contributors of\r\npeacekeepers in the United Nations.\r\nI should note, however, that there are certain\r\nissues that continue to trouble us. In South Asia, our\r\nown region, the volatility of the situation between two\r\nnuclear-capable countries is deeply worrisome.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nBangladesh encourages all concerned in South Asia to\r\nexercise utmost restraint and seek solutions to their\r\ndifferences through dialogue and meaningful\r\nengagement.\r\nAfter emerging from the most destructive episode\r\nin its history, Afghanistan has yet to be given the\r\nwherewithal for recovery and reconstruction. The\r\ninternational community must redouble its efforts to\r\nsecure peace throughout Afghanistan and accelerate the\r\nreconstruction and rebuilding of the country. Unless we\r\ndo so, the long-term security and stability of our region\r\nwill remain very uncertain.\r\nIn the Middle East, the continued denial of the\r\nright of the Palestinian people to their own State and to\r\nfreedom greatly concern us. The continued illegal\r\noccupation of Palestinian land, the trampling of human\r\nrights and the atrocities perpetrated against the\r\nPalestinian people by Israel must end immediately.\r\nSerious efforts must be resumed to seek a\r\ncomprehensive solution to the problem — a solution\r\nthat addresses the legitimate concerns of the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nWe welcome the announcement made in Baghdad\r\nwith regard to the return of the weapons inspectors, and\r\nwe see this as a significant step towards the fulfilment\r\nof obligations under Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe havoc wrought in Africa by ethnic conflict,\r\ndisease and famine is very disturbing. The financial\r\nturmoil in Latin America is a matter of anxiety for all\r\nof us. Commitments to the least developed countries\r\nremain largely unfulfilled. The existence of large trade-\r\ndistorting subsidies that impede development is\r\npainfully clear. Restrictions on the movement of factors\r\nof production, including manpower, remain a major\r\nimpediment to progress. Lack of consideration of the\r\nemotional and human aspects of people’s movement\r\nacross frontiers remains a great source of pain. The\r\nconcept of a global fund for poverty alleviation\r\nfinanced through some form of international taxation is\r\nalso worth considering. These are issues that we, with\r\nour limited capacity, can do little to influence —\r\nthough in our modest way we will do our very best to\r\nhelp. Those who can must do more.\r\nFor our part, we will play an effective role — as\r\nwe are indeed doing — in all international forums. In\r\nthe World Trade Organization we will continue to work\r\nwith others to implement the development objectives of\r\nthe Doha Round and to pursue fairer trade. We will\r\ncooperate with the international monetary institutions\r\nand other agencies, funds and programmes to promote\r\nthe welfare of our people and those of a comparable\r\nmilieu. Working within the United Nations, we shall\r\nendeavour in every possible way to strengthen its\r\ninstitutions and to support reforms that will render\r\nthem more participatory, representative and\r\ndemocratic. These are pledges that are enshrined in the\r\nvision for the future of the Government of the People’s\r\nRepublic of Bangladesh under the dynamic leadership\r\nof Begum Khaleda Zia. They are commitments that are\r\nat the core of the Bangladeshi ethos.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency The Honourable Julian Robert Hunte,\r\nMinister for Foreign External Affairs, International\r\nTrade and Civil Aviation of Saint Lucia.\r\nMr. Hunte (Saint Lucia): I should like to add the\r\nvoice of my delegation to the voices of those who have\r\nalready congratulated Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to\r\nthe presidency and those who have thanked the\r\noutgoing President for his contribution to the work of\r\nthe Assembly. Saint Lucia pledges its full cooperation\r\nto Mr. Kavan as he assumes the presidential mantle.\r\nWe are pleased that, at the commencement of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, we are\r\nwelcoming Switzerland and East Timor to our\r\nOrganization. We have no doubt that they will both\r\nenrich the deliberations of our organization as we seek\r\nto advance its cause. Saint Lucia, as a member of the\r\nSpecial Committee on decolonization, is particularly\r\npleased that East Timor will at last able be to enter\r\nthese hallowed halls as an independent State in its own\r\nright.\r\nIn this age of cutting-edge technology, scientific\r\nmiracles and the conquest of space, it is barely\r\nconceivable that human misery and suffering are still\r\nnot decreasing. From Africa to Asia and from Asia to\r\nthe Caribbean, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is accelerating\r\nand spreading, while known killers such as tuberculosis\r\nand malaria continue to stalk human existence. We\r\nwatch as large parts of humanity fall, often seeming to\r\nlack the impetus needed to have a substantial impact on\r\nsuch scourges.\r\nA large percentage of the population of the\r\ndeveloping world lives in degrading poverty, and many\r\nare on the brink of starvation and famine. Some 24,000\r\npersons, most of them from the developing world, die\r\neach day of hunger. Approximately 12 million people\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nin Southern Africa now face starvation. Yet there is a\r\nworldwide glut in agricultural production. In some\r\nplaces there is too much; in others there is too little.\r\nThe crisis of the development agenda is reflective\r\nof the crisis of legitimacy that is being experienced by\r\nthe global economic governance structure. Saint Lucia\r\nagain calls for the reformation of the global economic\r\ngovernance system to ensure that the planet’s resources\r\nconstitute the common heritage of all mankind. A\r\ncorollary to global economic reformation is the\r\nequitable sharing of resources to ensure a decent\r\nquality of life for all and the redistribution of wealth\r\nand power at the systemic level to redress existing\r\ninjustices so that we no longer have a world with too\r\nmuch in one place and too little in another.\r\nA major impediment to development is the lack\r\nof transparency, accountability and democratic norms\r\nwithin the operations of the global governance\r\nnetwork. Saint Lucia has always upheld the democratic\r\nimperative within the domestic realm as the flagship\r\nfor the advancement of social progress and\r\ndevelopment. Saint Lucia reiterates that it is only\r\nthrough democratic participation and the belief that all\r\npeople are created equal and deserve equal rights and\r\nopportunities that the right of the peoples of the\r\ndeveloping world to true self-determination and\r\ndevelopment can be realized. It is only by upholding\r\nthe principles of transparency, accountability and\r\ndemocracy that the International Monetary Fund, the\r\nWorld Bank, the World Trade Organization and our\r\nown United Nations system can become relevant to the\r\ntask of solving the problem of global poverty.\r\nThe Doha declaration alone will not prevent the\r\nexclusion of States from economic decision-making\r\nand global governance. The non-involvement of\r\nGovernments in the development process runs counter\r\nto the original mission of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.\r\nSaint Lucia challenges the United Nations system to\r\nraise its universal voice, in concert with the discordant\r\ncoalition, opposing any unilateral determination of the\r\nfate of the planet’s natural resources and the billions of\r\npoor people depending on them for survival. Saint\r\nLucia calls for the democratization and reform of the\r\nWTO into an organization supportive of the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of all States. This is the only way that\r\ndeveloping countries can protect their interests within\r\nthe multilateral trading system.\r\nSaint Lucia laments the fact that the developing\r\nworld may have compromised its development agenda\r\nby signing the WTO agreements without the principle\r\nof special and differential treatment being an integral\r\npart of those agreements. This omission has to be\r\ncorrected in the Doha round. Why is it so difficult to\r\nunderstand that, given the critical nexus between trade\r\nand development, developing countries cannot be\r\nsubjected to the same expectations, rules and\r\nregulations that govern trade among developed\r\ncountries? The ideology of a level playing field is a\r\nmyth ill conceived. Equitable participation in world\r\ntrade demands that special consideration and assistance\r\nbe given to the developing world, particularly to\r\nvulnerable, small island States like Saint Lucia. We\r\nmust resist — and I underscore the word “resist” — all\r\nattempts to make the WTO a mechanism for unleashing\r\na silent economic war on the poor and powerless by\r\nprotecting corporate interests while marginalizing\r\nGovernments and people.\r\nWe need a Marshall Plan to address the terror of\r\npoverty and the stark disparities between the developed\r\nand developing world in trade technology, life\r\nexpectancy and illiteracy. Monterrey produced neither\r\na global development coalition nor a binding mandate\r\nwith targets and resources for implementing the United\r\nNations millennium goals of halving poverty,\r\neffectively addressing HIV/AIDS, closing the digital\r\ndivide and strengthening Governments. The message\r\nfrom Monterrey is that there is neither political will nor\r\nresources available for development. Of the estimated\r\n$55 billion required annually to implement the\r\nmillennium goals, Monterrey pledged only $5 billion\r\nover a period of three years. Further, official\r\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries has\r\ncontinued to decline from the United Nations target of\r\n0.7 per cent to 0.24 per cent.\r\nDespite the fact that debt servicing accounts for a\r\nnet transfer of resources from developing to developed\r\ncountries, draining a significant amount of\r\ndevelopment funds, Monterrey made no commitment to\r\nthe cancellation of the crippling debt of developing\r\ncountries. No attempts were made to stem the serious\r\nmarginalization of small island developing States or to\r\ngrant access to concessionary funding from\r\ninternational financial institutions for their\r\ndevelopment.\r\nSadly, Johannesburg was more of the same. The\r\nconference was convened to strike a global deal on\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nsustainable development, but failed to initiate the\r\npeople-driven process necessary to transform the\r\nglobal economic crisis into development for all. No\r\nmechanisms were established to insulate decisions\r\ntaken from being undermined in the current global\r\neconomic governance system. The failure of\r\nJohannesburg to establish an international citizen’s\r\nagenda — with clear targets, resources and\r\ncommitments to implement development goals – that\r\nprotects the poor and the planet will reverberate\r\nthroughout the developing world.\r\nThe United Nations appears to have become\r\ncomplicit in its own demise, permitting the principles\r\nof universality and the quest for justice and equality to\r\nbecome obsolete. This institution was once the proud\r\nchampion of the redistribution of global economic\r\npower and the establishment of a new international\r\neconomic order. Today, however, in the major United\r\nNations institutions, such as the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, the United Nations Development Programme\r\nand the General Assembly, there is a deafening silence.\r\nFurther, the gains made by the developing world\r\nwithin the United Nations are quickly being eroded.\r\nThe post of Director-General for International\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development has been\r\nabolished. This was one of the few concrete outcomes\r\nof the developing world’s thrust to secure a stronger\r\npresence in support of international economic\r\ncooperation. And the United Nations Centre on\r\nTransnational Corporations, which effectively tracked\r\nthe activities of transnational corporations in the South\r\nand their contribution to sustainable development, has\r\nbeen dismantled. Today, the market is left to determine\r\neverything, with corporate rule of the global economy\r\nresulting in untold havoc to the environment and the\r\npoor. No mechanism is in place to ensure corporate\r\nresponsibility and accountability.\r\nSaint Lucia urges the United Nations to\r\nreinstitute the United Nations Centre on Transnational\r\nCorporations. Further, Saint Lucia calls on the United\r\nNations to resist any attempt to weaken and\r\nmarginalize the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development.\r\nWhile development within the United Nations\r\nsystem is being undermined through the cutting and\r\nfreezing of the United Nations regular and core budget,\r\nthere have been substantial increases in the\r\npeacekeeping budget. Military spending — particularly\r\nthat of developed countries — keeps escalating, and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the\r\nBretton Woods institutions are being reoriented away\r\nfrom development. Development is in need of a global\r\ncoalition, without which we will pursue wars against\r\nterrorism in vain.\r\nSaint Lucia condemns terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations. For small island developing States,\r\nhowever, security against terrorism and other threats is\r\nnot merely a matter of military spending, but is rather a\r\nmultidimensional concern encompassing matters such\r\nas drug trafficking and small arms, transnational crime,\r\nunemployment, poverty and underdevelopment.\r\nTherefore, whilst maintaining its peacekeeping\r\nmandate, the United Nations should not abandon the\r\nother mandates of its Charter — the economic and\r\nsocial development of all peoples — if it intends to\r\nremain relevant and credible. This institution needs to\r\nregain its balance and to listen to the fainting voice of\r\nhumanity in a universal chorus proclaiming global\r\npeace, justice, prosperity and equality for all.\r\nIt would be remiss of me if I did not at this point\r\nreiterate Saint Lucia’s call for an end to the economic\r\nembargo on Cuba and for that country to be allowed to\r\npursue its right to the development of its people and to\r\nassume its rightful role within our hemisphere.\r\nIn closing, let me state quite categorically that, as\r\na vulnerable small island developing State, Saint Lucia\r\nis among those countries which require the support and\r\nprotection of the United Nations system and the safety\r\nof a strong, democratic and fair multilateral system\r\nmost of all. We appreciate the support received from\r\nthis institution and from friendly countries as we seek\r\nto advance our country’s development. We also\r\nreaffirm our commitment to working with all Member\r\nStates to ensure peace, security and development for all\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Talbak Nazarov,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nTajikistan.\r\nMr. Nazarov (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): It is\r\na great pleasure to join in the heartfelt congratulations\r\naddressed to Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the high\r\npost of President of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Undoubtedly, he will apply his\r\nextensive professional and life experience to benefit\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nthis General Assembly session, so that it will give fresh\r\nimpetus to the efforts of our universal Organization.\r\nEast Timor and Switzerland are new Members\r\nthis year. The international community welcomes them\r\nwith joy. We congratulate the Governments and peoples\r\nof those two friendly nations.\r\nEvery year the issues the United Nations must\r\naddress become more challenging. The need for a\r\nuniversal organization has become especially urgent\r\nover the past decade. It is understandable. The cold war\r\nhas ended and humanity has entered a new stage of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAddressing global issues and challenges through\r\ncommon efforts has become a basic dimension of that\r\nnew stage. Another distinctive feature is the\r\nconstructive nature of such efforts. A third dimension\r\nis common understanding that all those efforts, coupled\r\nwith democratization of internal societies and\r\ninternational relations, should bring about improved\r\nliving standards for Member States. The United\r\nNations can and must play a significant role in\r\ncoordinating national, regional and international efforts\r\nin the age of globalization.\r\nTajikistan has been a Member State for the 10\r\nyears of its new history. As the Tajik State was being\r\nestablished, a fratricidal conflict was sweeping the\r\ncountry. However, over the past five years, peace and\r\nstability have prevailed in Tajikistan. Respect for Tajik\r\nhistory and traditions, human rights, an atmosphere of\r\ntolerance for diverse opinions and views and focus on\r\nmajor concerns of the nation are all fundamental\r\ncomponents of the peace process in Tajikistan, whose\r\nlessons could be applied in resolving conflicts in other\r\nhotspots of the world.\r\nTajikistan, which suffered to achieve its\r\ndemocracy, is creating today a secular society, has a\r\nsubstantial foundation for its development and looks to\r\nthe future with optimism. That optimistic outlook is\r\ndetermined by President Emomali Rakhmonov’s\r\nrational and carefully considered policy of establishing\r\ngood relations with Tajikistan’s neighbours and by the\r\nassistance and support received from the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Tajik people extend special appreciation to\r\nthe United Nations, which, during the time of our\r\ndifficult trials, demonstrated in the most effective\r\nmanner its peacemaking and humanitarian capacities.\r\nThe United Nations, working in close cooperation with\r\nthe Tajik Government, is showing in Tajikistan its\r\ncapacity to strengthen peace and stability. We are\r\nsatisfied with the performance of the United Nations\r\nTajikistan Office of Peace-building in our country and\r\nbelieve that the experience it gained in Tajikistan can\r\nbe used for the benefit of other States.\r\nThe rehabilitation of the economy, the eradication\r\nof poverty, increasing the living standard and job\r\ncreation are the issues that are still referred to as our\r\ncountry’s most pressing problems. Tajikistan is a State\r\nwhose social and economic development depends, to a\r\ngreat extent, on the international community’s common\r\nand comprehensive approach to the issues of\r\ncombating poverty, financing development, ensuring an\r\nequitable international trade system, eliminating\r\necological threats and resolving demographic\r\nproblems. In that context, we invariably favour further\r\nenhancement of the role of the United Nations as the\r\ncore international forum for developing such a\r\ncommon approach.\r\nOver the past few months, the Member States\r\nhave achieved some progress in that area. Overall, we\r\nbelieve the outcome of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey was positive,\r\nand we are looking forward to the implementation of\r\nits resolutions.\r\nEnvironmental issues and issues of sustainable\r\ndevelopment are among the top-ranking items of the\r\nUnited Nations agenda and, appropriately, are\r\nbecoming a significant component of multilateral\r\ndiplomacy. The World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, recently held in Johannesburg was one\r\nof the major events in that area. At the Summit, the\r\nworld’s top policy makers analysed the progress made\r\nin the implementation of Agenda 21 over the past 10\r\nyears. The concept of sustainable development that\r\nemerged from the United Nations Conference on\r\nEnvironment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro in\r\n1992, was further elaborated and acquired new\r\nmeaningful content. The international community faces\r\nthe task of meeting the challenges established at the\r\nforum in Johannesburg. Accomplishing that task could\r\ngive us hope that problems such as poverty eradication,\r\nenvironmental protection and ensuring social equity\r\ncan be resolved in a comprehensive manner.\r\nIt is our intention to make a viable contribution to\r\nimplementing the World Summit resolutions. We hope\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nthat international cooperation in that area will fully\r\naccount for the specific conditions and economic\r\ncapacities of the countries from different groups,\r\nparticularly, the developing countries and countries\r\nwith economies in transition.\r\nOver recent years we have witnessed a dynamic\r\nprocess in connection with the United Nations\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, the United\r\nNations Convention on Biological Diversity and the\r\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.\r\nThe number of Member States that ratified the Kyoto\r\nProtocol and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is\r\nincreasing. Interaction between countries in addressing\r\ndesertification and land degradation issues is gaining\r\nmomentum.\r\nTajikistan has been an active participant in those\r\nimportant processes. We believe it is essential to\r\nconsistently continue coordination of the\r\nimplementation of the Conventions in order to avoid\r\nduplication and ensure effective allocation of limited\r\ninternational resources.\r\nAmong the most valuable assets of our planet are\r\nwater resources. They are at the core of both ecological\r\nbalance and economic prosperity. They are an\r\nindispensable prerequisite for food production,\r\nimprovement of social welfare and economic growth.\r\nHowever, even today many regions of the world face a\r\nshortage of fresh water. According to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, if current practices of water usage persist, by\r\n2025 two thirds of the world’s population will be living\r\nin a country experiencing so-called water stress.\r\nThe urgency of the problem encouraged\r\nTajikistan to propose the initiative of proclaiming the\r\nyear 2003 the International Year of Freshwater. We\r\nbelieve that the preparation for that year and the\r\nvarious events planned within its framework, in\r\nparticular, the Third World Water Forum, to be held in\r\nJapan in March 2003, will give Member States a good\r\nopportunity to exchange their expertise gained in\r\napplying successful patterns of water-resource\r\nmanagement and in searching for needed finances and\r\nresources.\r\nIn putting forward the initiative for the\r\nInternational Year of Freshwater, we expected that the\r\nmajor focus of the events to be held in 2003 would be\r\non universal access to freshwater and diminishing the\r\npossibility of conflicts related to water shortage. That\r\nwould make a specific and substantial contribution to\r\nachieving the goals of sustainable development.\r\nIt is impossible to achieve the goals of\r\nsustainable development unless the economic\r\ncomponent of globalization is given due attention and\r\ndiscrimination in economic relations is eliminated. In\r\nan environment where wealthy countries benefit from\r\nglobalization and continue to get richer, while poor\r\ncounties get poorer, social tensions increase and cause\r\npolitical extremism, including the most extreme\r\nform — namely, terrorism. Counteracting the threat of\r\nterror is a long-term endeavour, since it is a\r\nphenomenon that is alien to human civilization, and it\r\nis multidimensional and deep-rooted. In addition to\r\nuniting the will of all its participants, applying military\r\nresources and strengthening the international legal\r\nframework, the anti-terrorist coalition established\r\nfollowing 11 September 2001 must direct its efforts\r\ntowards elimination of the primary reasons for\r\nterrorism, which can be traced to unsettled conflicts\r\nand outrageous social and economic inequities.\r\nTajikistan is actively participating in the common\r\neffort to ensure a unified international legal framework\r\nfor combating terrorism. Our country has become a\r\nparticipant in the most universal anti-terrorist\r\nconventions. We totally support the activities of the\r\nSecurity Council in this area. We highly appreciate the\r\nrole of the Counter-Terrorism Committee that was set\r\nup in compliance with resolution 1373 (2001), under\r\nthe leadership of Sir Jeremy Greenstock; this\r\nCommittee has assumed a central role in the\r\nunprecedented effort to establish a global system to\r\ncounteract international terrorism. Pursuant to the\r\nauthority conferred on it by the United Nations Charter,\r\nthe Security Council will continue to play an active\r\nrole in preventing threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity posed by terrorism.\r\nIt is essential to continue using all kinds of\r\npolitical, economic, financial and humanitarian\r\nmeasures in order to develop a comprehensive\r\napproach to the eradication of international terrorism.\r\nIt is important that the development of fundamental\r\nprinciples to combat terrorism be enhanced at the\r\ninternational legal level. In this connection, we expect\r\nthe General Assembly shortly to adopt a\r\ncomprehensive convention on combating international\r\nterrorism, as well as to complete negotiating and\r\nadopting a comprehensive international convention on\r\ncombating acts of nuclear terrorism.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nWe believe the time has come to convene a\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly in 2003 to\r\ndiscuss all aspects of combating terrorism and to adopt\r\nconsolidated decisions. At that time, we could also\r\ndiscuss the progress made over five years on the\r\nimplementation of the decisions of the twentieth\r\nspecial session dedicated to the illicit production, sale\r\nand trafficking of narcotics. In view of the ever-\r\nincreasing drug threat, we regard the creation of an\r\nanti-narcotics coalition of States as an issue of critical\r\nimportance. The war against the international terrorist\r\nunderground will not be effective until the international\r\ncommunity makes substantial progress in its struggle\r\nagainst drug cartels and narco-barons.\r\nA future global system of counteracting terrorist\r\nand narcotics threats cannot be created without support\r\nfrom regional and subregional structures and\r\ninstitutions that have been active in this and other areas\r\nof international cooperation.\r\nAn increase in the number of regional\r\norganizations and the strengthening of their\r\nmechanisms not only reflects an objective need for\r\nfilling the lacunae in the interaction of neighbouring\r\nStates, but also meets the urgent need to establish\r\nadditional channels for conducting a dialogue and\r\nexchange of views on the most important issues. The\r\nlarge-scale operations to liberate the Afghan people\r\nfrom the repressive Taliban regime and measures aimed\r\nat the restoration of peace and stability in war-ravaged\r\nAfghanistan have demonstrated what can be\r\naccomplished when the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations combine their efforts.\r\nToday, our friendly neighbour, Afghanistan,\r\ncontinues to go through a complicated process of\r\nachieving national accord and establishing stable\r\ninstitutions of government and a stable political\r\nregime. The revival of an independent and peaceful\r\nAfghanistan is taking place under difficult conditions.\r\nThe urgent problem of providing security still exists.\r\nThe humanitarian situation also remains alarming.\r\nHowever, what has been accomplished by the\r\nGovernment of Hamid Karzai is very impressive.\r\nIt is important that the United Nations continue to\r\ncoordinate the international community’s common\r\nefforts in strengthening the process of restoring and\r\nrehabilitating post-war Afghanistan and completing the\r\nelimination of hotbeds of international terrorism on its\r\nterritory and the eradication of religious extremism and\r\nthe narcotics threat. In this context, the United Nations\r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) faces\r\nserious challenges. We believe it is necessary to\r\ncontinue increasing economic and humanitarian\r\nassistance to Afghanistan and not stop at what has been\r\naccomplished so far.\r\nThe Government of Tajikistan will continue to\r\ncontribute to the revival of Afghanistan through\r\nbuilding its relations with the friendly Afghan people\r\non the basis of friendship, mutual respect and\r\nmultifaceted cooperation for the benefit of our two\r\ncountries and regional security.\r\nWith respect to reform of the United Nations, and\r\nregional issues, it is important to realize that neither\r\nglobal challenges nor most of the urgent regional issues\r\ncan be dealt with successfully unless the whole United\r\nNations system is strengthened and its core role in\r\ninternational affairs is reinforced. To achieve this in\r\npractice, one has to support the Secretary-General in\r\nhis efforts to reform the United Nations internal system\r\nand to recruit personnel with high professional skills.\r\nThe Member States should assist the Secretary-General\r\nin his efforts to expand the capacity of the Secretariat\r\nto carry out peacekeeping operations, prevent and\r\nresolve conflicts and contribute to post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding. Reform also implies further efforts towards\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations system as a\r\nwhole, so that the capacities and contributions of small\r\ncountries, no matter how numerous their problems, can\r\nbe united with those of large States.\r\nWe are firmly convinced that reforms should\r\nfocus on improving the efficiency of special United\r\nNations institutions and on the implementation of\r\ndevelopment projects. We deem it important that the\r\nUnited Nations reconsider the allocation of its\r\nresources, that it stop implementing programmes and\r\nprojects of low effectiveness, and instead commit the\r\nfreed funds to new priorities.\r\nThe year that has passed since the fifty-sixth\r\nAssembly session has convincingly demonstrated that\r\nthe United Nations, with its 190 Member States, is\r\nirreplaceable when dealing with international affairs.\r\nAs never before, the United Nations has proven its\r\nability to meet the most complicated challenges faced\r\nby humanity. It is our conviction that, in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, by cooperating with the United Nations,\r\nwe will be able to create a world without destructive\r\nwars, a world that will become secure and prosperous.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahamat Saleh Annadif, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and African Integration of Chad.\r\nMr. Annadif (Chad) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, I should like, on behalf of all the members of\r\nthe Chadian delegation that I have the honour to lead,\r\nand on my own behalf, to warmly congratulate Mr. Jan\r\nKavan on his election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly. In\r\ndischarging that heavy responsibility, he can count on\r\nmy delegation’s full availability and support\r\nthroughout this session, all the more so since the\r\ninternational community has honoured my country by\r\nelecting it to one of the prestigious posts of Vice-\r\nPresident of the Assembly. I take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the Members of the\r\nOrganization for the trust placed in my country, Chad.\r\nMembers may be assured that we shall do our utmost to\r\ndeserve that trust.\r\nMy thanks and congratulations go also to\r\nMr. Kavan’s predecessor and to his team for the work\r\naccomplished during the fifty-sixth session.\r\nI should also like to pay particular and well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, whose commitment and ceaseless efforts to\r\nachieve sustainable peace and development in the\r\nworld are welcome and should be recognized.\r\n Lastly, I express my sincere and warm\r\ncongratulations to the Swiss Confederation on its\r\nadmission to the Organization. Chad, which enjoys\r\nclose relations of friendship and cooperation with that\r\ncountry, welcomes its decision to join the great United\r\nNations family. A country devoted to democratic and\r\npeaceful values, Switzerland will undoubtedly\r\ncontribute to enriching our debates on all issues.\r\nThe current session is taking place one year after\r\nthe terrible attacks perpetrated against the United\r\nStates of America on 11 September 2001, which\r\nplunged American families and those of other nations\r\ninto mourning. The Government and the people of\r\nChad once again join the rest of the international\r\ncommunity in paying tribute to the memory of the\r\nthousands of innocent victims of that act of blind\r\nsavagery, which nothing can justify.\r\nUnfortunately, those sad events have brutally\r\nalerted us to the numerous challenges that we\r\nabsolutely must face if we wish to one day bring about\r\na just and equitable international society that enables\r\neach of its members to develop fully. In addition, those\r\nacts of despair can be checked only if their roots —\r\nwhich are nourished by unequal international relations\r\nbroadening daily the gap between rich and poor — are\r\neradicated. My country firmly condemns that form of\r\npolitical expression, from whatever side it may come,\r\nand is ready to associate itself with any initiative of the\r\ninternational community to establish a new world order\r\nbased on democracy and sustainable development.\r\nToday, the United Nations is called on more than\r\never to help to establish a fairer and more prosperous\r\ninternational society. We note with satisfaction the\r\nOrganization’s frequent efforts to ultimately eradicate\r\nthe scourges of disease and malnutrition — in short,\r\nthose of underdevelopment. In that regard, numerous\r\nworld meetings at the level of heads of State or\r\nGovernment have been organized under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nations or of specialized agencies with a\r\nview to implementing the decisions and\r\nrecommendations of the Millennium Summit. But the\r\npoint is not to have Summits; above all, we must match\r\nwords with deeds.\r\nThe Republic of Chad, like all other developing\r\nStates, aspires to a better life and well-being for its\r\npopulation. His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby rightly\r\nstated, in his inaugural address on 8 August 2001, that\r\nhis mandate would have the double aims of peace and\r\neconomic progress. In order to do that, Chad is relying\r\non the early exploitation of its mineral and agricultural\r\nwealth. We take this opportunity to inform the\r\nAssembly and to reassure the international community,\r\nincluding the friends of Chad, that the work to carry\r\nout its oil project is proceeding under good conditions.\r\nAccording to forecasts, the first barrels of oil may be\r\nbrought to market starting in July 2003.\r\nHowever, despite the prospects offered to Chad\r\nby the oil age, the Government is aware of the\r\nweakness of the national economic structures, of the\r\ndebt burden and of the imbalances that make the\r\npopulation’s living conditions precarious. Once again,\r\nwe call for our bilateral and multilateral partners to\r\nincrease their assistance and simply to cancel external\r\ndebt, as the African Union has always recommended.\r\nLong captive to its domestic problems, the\r\nRepublic of Chad, now more than ever before, intends\r\nto shoulder its responsibilities within the international\r\ncommunity, particularly on the level of the African\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\ncontinent. Therefore, the Government is committed to\r\nhelping to make the African Union — whose birth was\r\ncelebrated on 9 July 2002 at Durban, South Africa — a\r\ngenuine instrument of the continent’s political and\r\neconomic integration. The New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) is part of that major\r\nobjective. In the framework of North-South and South-\r\nSouth cooperation, NEPAD deserves the support of\r\nAfrica’s development partners.\r\nBut again, Chad is among those who think that\r\nAfrica’s salvation lies in the hands of Africans\r\nthemselves. To that goal, they must take courageous\r\npolitical decisions and transcend their differences so\r\nthat the African Union can become a reality, because\r\nthe disruptions and crises of all kinds suffered by that\r\ngreat and rich continent are sources of serious anxiety.\r\nHowever, the latest news coming from various\r\nAfrican subregions allow us to believe that an end to\r\nconflicts is in sight on the continent. Since the\r\nbeginning of this year, several meetings of national\r\nreconciliation have taken place and several peace\r\nagreements have been signed, including in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in Angola, in\r\nBurundi, in Sudan, in Sierra Leone and in Somalia.\r\nThat offers real hope for African populations. Chad\r\nintends to fully commit itself to ensure that that hope is\r\nrealized.\r\nAlong with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, the Chadian Government is concerned at\r\nthe situation that continues to prevail in the Middle\r\nEast. Unfortunately, that intolerable situation results\r\nfrom non-compliance with the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council and of the General Assembly. In\r\nthe light of its obligation to be fair to all Members of\r\nthe Organization, the Council should ban any policy of\r\ndouble standards and should ensure respect for its\r\ndecisions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967), 338\r\n(1973) and 1397 (2002). Genuine peace in the Middle\r\nEast demands that.\r\nLikewise, the Government of the Republic of\r\nChad cannot remain silent on another situation of\r\ninjustice that continues to preoccupy the Organization:\r\nits exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. That\r\nissue comes back to us every year like a boomerang\r\nbecause we handled it badly more than 30 years ago.\r\nFor us, as a result, it is a matter of conscience that\r\nchallenges all of us to find a solution. We have stated\r\non a number of occasions that it is not a question of\r\nredressing one injustice by committing another;0 it is\r\nsimply a question of giving back to the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan, a democratic and responsible\r\nsovereign State, and to its people the place they should\r\nhave on the international stage. This is why, once\r\nagain, the Government of Chad calls for the admission\r\nof The Republic of China on Taiwan to the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAt its creation in 1945 the United Nations had 51\r\nMembers. Now, almost 200 countries are full Members\r\nof the Organization. This growth means that it is time\r\nfor an in-depth reform of its structures to allow for\r\ngreater participation by all Member States and\r\nincreased accountability for the taking of international\r\ndecisions that have a definite impact on the life of all\r\nour citizens. This is because globalization should not\r\nbe regarded only as economic, but also as political.\r\nThus, Chad feels that the restructuring of the\r\nUnited Nations is essential and should focus on the\r\nfollowing two points: first, strengthening the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in order to make it more democratic\r\nand more active in decision-making; and secondly, an\r\nincrease in the number of the members of the Security\r\nCouncil in order to achieve better representation for all\r\nthe geographic areas of the world. Chad therefore\r\nendorses that position, which is also that of the African\r\nUnion.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement I wish to call to\r\nmind a happy event which took place in my country\r\njust one year ago. In July 2001 a significant scientific\r\ndiscovery was made in the Djourab desert in the north\r\nof Chad, by researchers headed by a French-Chadian\r\npaleontological mission. This was the discovery of the\r\nfossilized skull of a hominid known as Sahelanthropus\r\ntchadensis, dating back approximately 7 million years.\r\nSahelanthropus tchadensis, which means man of the\r\nChadian Sahel, has been nicknamed Toumai which\r\nmeans hope of life in the local language. Study of the\r\nskull has indicated that this is a new human species, a\r\nnew earliest member of humankind.\r\nThis discovery has had a significant impact in the\r\nscientific community and in world public opinion,\r\nbecause it challenges the many theories concerning the\r\norigin of humankind. Toumai is the common ancestor\r\nof us all, and Chad is now regarded as the cradle of\r\nhumankind. In order to mark this important discovery,\r\nthe Chadian Government envisions the establishment\r\nof a department of paleontology to foster research and\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\neducation in this scientific discipline, as well as the\r\nconstruction of a museum to develop scientific tourism\r\nin Chad.\r\nMy country will be relying on the support of the\r\ninternational community to carry out these projects in\r\nthe sphere of scientific research and paleontology in\r\nparticular. All present are warmly invited to visit Chad,\r\nnow known as the cradle of humankind, whose tourist\r\nassets have thus been enhanced by this new scientific\r\ndiscovery.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Abou Drahamane Sangaré,\r\nMinister of State and Minister for External Relations\r\nand Ivorians Abroad of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Sangaré (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): I\r\nam pleased to convey to Mr. Jan Kavan the warm\r\ncongratulations of my Government on his election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. We equally extend our congratulations to\r\nthe other members of the Bureau. We assure them that\r\nthe Ivorian delegation will spare no effort in making its\r\ncontribution to the success of this session.\r\nWe would be remiss if we did not mention here\r\nthe tremendous work of His Excellency Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, who, with his great experience led\r\nthe difficult fifty-sixth session to a positive conclusion,\r\nof which we are all aware. Côte d’Ivoire is grateful for\r\nthat. A reconciled Côte d’Ivoire conveys its fraternal\r\ngreetings to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, with\r\nparticular thanks for his tireless efforts. It is a great\r\npleasure for my Government to welcome and\r\ncongratulate the Swiss Confederation upon its\r\nadmission as a State Member of the United Nations.\r\nMembers will agree with me that the fifty-sixth\r\nsession was a very difficult one. How can we forget the\r\nsad memory of 11 September 2001, which will cast a\r\nshadow over the work of our Organization for a long\r\ntime to come. This session in particular, as it\r\nimmediately follows the fifty-sixth, must learn all the\r\nappropriate lessons from the last session and provide a\r\nnew dimension to international relations.\r\nIn the opinion of the delegation of Côte d’Ivoire,\r\nthe renewed need to recast multilateral inter-State\r\nrelations can be articulated, inter alia, around the\r\nfollowing themes: United Nations reform; a steadfast\r\nfight against poverty; human rights; and international\r\nsecurity.\r\nIt has become a truism to say that if the United\r\nNations had not existed, it would have had to be\r\ninvented. After more than 50 years of existence — and\r\nthis has been recognized over and over again — on the\r\ndawn of the third millennium, the United Nations\r\nwould do well to shake off the dust and adapt itself to\r\nthe new times.\r\nAlong these lines, for almost 10 years we have\r\nseen negotiations on reform of the membership and of\r\nthe working methods of the Security Council. It is time\r\nfor specific measures to be taken so we may have a\r\ncomprehensive debate based on the positions of the\r\nvarious regional groups. For our part, Côte d’Ivoire is\r\nconvinced that two permanent seats and three non-\r\npermanent seats for the African continent would be in\r\nkeeping with the times. Côte d’Ivoire is ready to make\r\na contribution to any resolution or decision which\r\nwould help modernize the Security Council.\r\nFor 30 years following the Second World War, the\r\npriorities of the international community were such\r\nthings as reconstruction, decolonization and the cold\r\nwar, to name a few. Nowadays, misery and poverty,\r\nwhich appeal to human conscience, are, as far as we\r\nare concerned, the number-one threat to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe greater the gap between rich and poor\r\ncountries, the more emigration there will be to the rich\r\ncountries, whose forecasts and development\r\nprogrammes will then be undermined. Contrary to what\r\nsome might think, in the opinion of my delegation the\r\nfight against poverty is an essential component of\r\npreventive diplomacy. Both inside and outside a given\r\ncountry, the fight against poverty is the prime operation\r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nMy Government has understood this, and we have\r\ndecentralized our administration through the\r\nestablishment of district councils. Now it is up to the\r\n58 administrative districts to identify their own needs,\r\nto establish their priorities and carry out their\r\ndevelopment projects financed from the annual budget\r\nunder the appropriate national legislation.\r\nWith respect to the financing of a decentralized\r\nadministration, Côte d’Ivoire takes this opportunity to\r\nthank its developmental partners for their aid and\r\nsupport, and we appeal to the international community\r\nto make additional contributions to our decentralization\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\npolicy. I reaffirm that Côte d’Ivoire has enormous\r\npotential and, now more than ever, offers extraordinary\r\nopportunities for investment and partnership.\r\nWe welcome the results of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, which was\r\nheld at Monterrey from 18 to 22 March 2002, as well\r\nas the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\r\nheld in Johannesburg, and the 2001 Doha meeting of\r\nthe World Trade Organization. We would like to see the\r\nconclusions of those three important meetings turned\r\ninto concrete action.\r\nWe cannot repeat it enough: the efforts of\r\ndeveloping countries will be in vain unless measures\r\nare taken to ease the debt burden and unless the\r\ninternational community succeeds in preventing the\r\nnegative effects of globalization.\r\nAfter the fall of the Berlin wall, the market\r\neconomy became part of the economic standards of the\r\ninternational community. This new economic\r\nunderstanding means more than ever that we must\r\nabandon the logic that says that we should have, on one\r\nhand, those who produce only raw materials and, on\r\nthe other, those who produce only finished products. To\r\nenable the developing countries to enter the industrial\r\nage and have access to markets throughout the world,\r\nwe need a better organization of international\r\nsolidarity, and scrupulous respect for the resolutions\r\nthat have been adopted.\r\nIn the opinion of my delegation, with the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), Africa now offers a favourable\r\nframework for the exercise of international economic\r\nsolidarity. NEPAD must remain a programme that\r\nassists the African Union, and not a new overlapping\r\ninstitution. Côte d’Ivoire is happy to see the\r\nestablishment of the African Union, and it will play its\r\nrole in consolidating this unique tool of international\r\ncooperation.\r\nWhile we welcome the progress realized in the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire is still deeply concerned about issues relating\r\nto the right to health. My delegation would like to\r\nreturn to the question of HIV/AIDS which, more so\r\nthan malaria, is the number-one public health problem\r\nthroughout the world. According to the Joint United\r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), in 2001 40 million\r\npeople throughout the world, 58 per cent of them\r\nwomen, were infected by the HIV virus. Of the 40\r\nmillion people who are HIV-positive, nearly 29 million\r\nlive in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is progressing,\r\nand in Côte d’Ivoire it is especially hitting the most\r\nactive segments of the population, namely the 14-to-45\r\nage group.\r\nIn spite of the many praiseworthy efforts made by\r\nCôte d’Ivoire, which has also pledged to implement a\r\nuniversal health insurance system, and those made by\r\nthe international community in its fight against the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, the results do not yet meet\r\npeople’s expectations. As we await a miracle cure for\r\nthe mutant AIDS virus, more than ever we have to\r\nredouble our efforts regarding prevention on the one\r\nhand, and access to medicine for the neediest segments\r\nof society on the other. It is also important that the\r\nstruggle be waged within the framework of ongoing\r\ninternational coordination, which is the only guarantee\r\nof success, and that decision-makers show more\r\ninterest in implementing the outcomes of such\r\ncoordination.\r\nPeace and the security of goods and persons are\r\nthe alpha and omega of any development. While the\r\nend of the cold war seemed to justify a certain\r\nsatisfaction, we must recognize that recent events do\r\nnot give us much reason to rejoice. The destruction of\r\nlight weapons in a few places should not let us ignore\r\nthe submerged part of the iceberg. In spite of pledges\r\nmade, the sale of light arms in particular continues to\r\nprosper, with the resulting child soldiers and disabled\r\npeople, not to mention all the refugees and the\r\nhomeless fleeing conflict areas.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on the Illicit\r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\r\nAspects, which was held last year, delivered some\r\nconclusions which were generally accepted by\r\neveryone. My delegation hopes that very soon a report\r\nof the Secretary-General will enable us to assess the\r\nresults of that Conference to date.\r\nIn terms of nuclear weapons, the key event of the\r\npast two years was the end of the 1972 Treaty on the\r\nLimitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems between\r\nthe two greatest nuclear Powers. This situation is of\r\nconcern to Côte d’Ivoire. Therefore, my country is very\r\nhappy to see that in the framework of a new agreement\r\nrecently signed by the United States of America and\r\nthe Russian Federation, those two nuclear Powers have\r\ndecided on a two-thirds reduction of their nuclear\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\narsenals over a 10-year period, zero level being the\r\nultimate objective to be achieved as soon as possible.\r\nLike other countries in the international community,\r\nCôte-d’Ivoire has taken note of this major event, and\r\nencourages the two parties to pursue their efforts\r\ntowards a total reduction of the nuclear threat.\r\nHere, my delegation would like to thank,\r\ncommend and encourage France, our long-standing\r\npartner, which for the last three years, through its\r\nvigorous policy of disarmament, has significantly\r\nreduced its nuclear arsenal.\r\nLet me reaffirm the position of Côte d’Ivoire on\r\ndisarmament, which does not differ from the position\r\nof the group of non-aligned countries. It is imperative\r\nthat everyone respect the non-nuclear zones established\r\naround the world, including the one created in Africa\r\nunder the Pelindaba Treaty.\r\nThe events of 11 September 2001 were an\r\nappalling atrocity which caused the immediate loss of\r\nlife of more people than ever in the history of terrorist\r\nattacks. Our objective should be to avoid a repetition of\r\nsuch attacks through concerted action, supported by the\r\nappropriate means. To combat this scourge, in our\r\nopinion, we must grasp the problem at its roots and\r\nunderstand all its political, economic, psychological\r\nand moral components. So that we do not play into the\r\nhands of the terrorists, the fight against terrorism\r\nshould help bring peoples together. Therefore, the\r\nsimultaneous dialogue among civilizations and cultures\r\nmust inspire the action of the international community.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire has taken legal and economic measures\r\nto combat terrorism. It has set out to collaborate with\r\nother parties and to develop specific legislation to fight\r\nagainst terrorism by defining and punishing infractions.\r\nMy country will continue to assume the\r\nobligations of international solidarity against terrorism,\r\nas laid out in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nTo do this, Côte d’Ivoire wishes to have, in addition to\r\nthe financial and logistical means it sorely lacks, the\r\nsupport of the international community with regard to\r\ntraining in the legal, banking and police areas. But no\r\nmatter what, my Government will continue its\r\ncooperation with the Security Council Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee, so that the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism will yield results which will\r\nhelp us preserve international peace and security.\r\nThe crisis which has shaken the Middle East for\r\ndecades is without a doubt a serious threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. The persistence of this\r\ncrisis is a challenge that appears to expose the\r\nimpotence of the international community to deal with\r\na conflict that, if we are not careful, could come to be\r\naccepted as commonplace. Yet we can at least say that\r\nsince the start of the conflict, the international\r\ncommunity has not folded its arms. Indeed, the United\r\nNations resolutions on the questions are innumerable.\r\nThe best known of them are Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338\r\n(1973) of 22 October 1973, resolutions supported by\r\nsuch forums as the Oslo and Madrid Conferences.\r\nAt the centre of the conflict are the inevitable\r\nissues of the need for the Palestinians to have a viable\r\nindependent State, and of the need for the State of\r\nIsrael to live in security and in peace with all its Arab\r\nneighbours, within internationally recognized borders.\r\nThat is why it is important to welcome the Saudi\r\ninitiative which recognizes Israel’s right to exist next to\r\na Palestinian State.\r\nIn that regard, Côte d’Ivoire is very happy to\r\nembrace Security Council resolution 1397 (2002) of 12\r\nMarch 2002, in which the Council, with the\r\nconcurrence of its five permanent members, affirmed a\r\nvision of a region where two States, Israel and\r\nPalestine, live side by side within secure and\r\nrecognized borders.\r\nIn Africa, we are happy to see the return of peace\r\nin Sierra Leone, in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and in Angola.\r\nWe must thank the political leaders of those States and\r\nall others who, one way or another, contributed to the\r\nend of hostilities in those countries. We call on them to\r\nhelp in the ongoing process of reconciliation and\r\nreconstruction.\r\nWhile we welcome those positive developments,\r\nwe are concerned by the ongoing hostilities in Liberia,\r\nthe Sudan, Somalia and the Great Lakes region. We\r\nmust all support the initiatives and the efforts of well-\r\nknown individuals such as former President Nelson\r\nMandela and President Bush, and those of the\r\ninternational community, particularly the United\r\nNations, the African Union, the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), for the\r\nreturn to peace and stability in this large region of our\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe urge all the sons and daughters of the region\r\nto understand that the return of peace and\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nreconciliation depends first of all on them. Only their\r\nwill peacefully to settle their disputes, whatever their\r\nnature, will make it possible to put an end to the\r\nsuffering of their peoples.\r\nThanks to the intelligence and good will of its\r\npeople, Côte d’Ivoire has been able to reconcile and\r\nfind an Ivorian solution to its recent political\r\ndifficulties. It encourages all parties to conflicts to\r\nhave confidence in themselves and in their ability to\r\nfind appropriate solutions to the issues that divide\r\nthem, in the interest of their populations and,\r\nultimately, that of Africa.\r\nI would like in conclusion to state that while the\r\nUnited Nations has “pushed back the frontiers of\r\nracism” (A/49/PV.14, p. 7), to quote former President\r\nNelson Mandela, it can, with genuine political will,\r\nachieve equally impressive results in other areas. We\r\nmust thus do everything we can to push far back the\r\nfrontiers of hatred, intolerance, violence and poverty or\r\nindeed to destroy those evils. Let us build a better\r\nworld, a world of peace and progress for ourselves and\r\nfuture generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Mesfin (Ethiopia): First of all, I wish to\r\nextend to Mr. Jan Kavan congratulations on his election\r\nas President of the fifty-seventh session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. I also wish to take this\r\nopportunity to commend his predecessor for his\r\ninvaluable contribution to what was achieved at the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Allow me\r\nalso to express our appreciation to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the effort he has been\r\nmaking to ensure that the United Nations becomes a\r\nmore effective instrument for tackling the very many\r\nchallenges faced by the international community.\r\nMy delegation would like to join others in\r\nwelcoming the admission of the Swiss Confederation\r\nto the United Nations. It is a country that has, indeed,\r\ncontributed so much to the Organization over the years.\r\nOur continent, Africa, and its peoples, continue to\r\nface enormous and daunting challenges. This is not\r\nnew. This is something that has been going on for the\r\nlast few decades, with the general economic and social\r\nsituation in the continent deteriorating even further.\r\nThe general trend has been one of an ever-faster\r\nmarginalization of Africa. The continent has yet to see\r\nthe benefits of globalization. Africa still awaits the\r\ncreation of an enabling international economic context\r\nfor progress in its efforts to wage war against poverty.\r\nThat effort is unlikely to succeed without greater\r\ninternational cooperation. Many in Africa, including\r\nmy own country, Ethiopia, are unlikely to meet the\r\ninternationally agreed poverty-related targets and\r\ngoals, including those set by the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration, without greater readiness on\r\nthe part of the international community to contribute\r\nmore to Africa’s fight against poverty.\r\nThe eradication of poverty is not only Africa’s\r\nchallenge or only that of the developing world. As was\r\nreiterated at the Johannesburg World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, poverty is the greatest global\r\nchallenge facing the world. The despair and\r\nhopelessness engendered by poverty have implications\r\nfor the world in general — not only for the people of\r\nthe South but for those of the North, as well.\r\nMany might have felt that the Johannesburg\r\nSummit failed to rise to the occasion and that its\r\nachievement was not commensurate with the gravity of\r\nthe challenges faced by the peoples of the world in a\r\nvariety of areas, most of all, in areas most relevant to\r\nthe eradication of poverty. But there was one thing\r\nwhich was unambiguously evident at the Johannesburg\r\nSummit. Those from both the North and the South\r\nstressed with one voice that the global apartheid we\r\ncurrently have is unsustainable. How can one\r\nimplement that vision? This is what continues to elude\r\nthe international community. It remains the case\r\ndespite some progress that has been made, including at\r\nMonterrey.\r\nThe eradication of poverty in Africa, and in my\r\nown country, is not primarily the responsibility of the\r\ninternational community. It is primarily our\r\nresponsibility to put our houses in order and to take the\r\nlead in rejuvenating Africa.\r\nThat is where in fact today there is a new\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Many in Africa are more\r\nprepared than ever before to take charge of their\r\ndestiny. There is a new thinking in Africa today and a\r\nrealistic resolve to ensure the regeneration of the\r\ncontinent. I am referring to the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). It is an initiative by\r\nAfrica which demonstrates the readiness of the\r\ncontinent to take charge of its future. It is a concrete\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\ncommitment by Africa to take the necessary steps in\r\nboth the economic and political areas towards creating\r\nenabling conditions for economic and social\r\ntransformation. It is a realistic initiative that specifies\r\nand underlines the obligation of African countries in all\r\nareas relevant to the creation of conditions conducive\r\nto economic and social development. Good governance\r\nis one such vital obligation to which the initiative\r\naccords the necessary importance. It is a major step for\r\nAfrica and one whose significance should be\r\nunderlined. The commitment to democracy and good\r\ngovernance has major implications for Africa not only\r\nin economic development but also in creating\r\nconditions for nurturing peace and stability.\r\nNonetheless, NEPAD cannot succeed without the\r\ncooperation of Africa’s partners and the international\r\ncommunity. And succeed it must, not only because\r\nNEPAD’s success is in the vital interest of Africa but\r\nalso because it is in the interest of the world in general.\r\nThe logic of globalization makes it obvious that no part\r\nof the globe is immune to the negative influences\r\nemanating from its other, less fortunate parts.\r\nRealistically speaking, we swim or sink together. It\r\nwould be unwise to believe that the growing\r\nmarginalization and decay of Africa will have no\r\nsignificant adverse implications for the stability and\r\nviability of the globalizing world. It is this common\r\ninterest that we all share which is the basis for our\r\nmutual obligation for the success of NEPAD. I must\r\nstate here that we have been encouraged by the\r\npreliminary response to NEPAD by many members of\r\nthe international community, including the G-8\r\ncountries and others. We are still hopeful that even\r\ngreater support and enthusiasm will be demonstrated\r\nby the international community to ensure that NEPAD\r\nwill be workable.\r\nEthiopia subscribes fully to the NEPAD\r\nframework. We are indeed at present in the process of\r\nimplementing the principles and ideas promoted by the\r\ninitiative. We will continue to be committed to carrying\r\nout our obligations for good governance, for creating\r\nenabling conditions for economic development and for\r\neradicating poverty.\r\nAll the efforts we are making to ensure success in\r\nthe fight against poverty are bound to fail without\r\npeace and durable stability. Here as well, Africa,\r\nincluding our subregion, the Horn of Africa, requires\r\nthe effective support of the international community.\r\nWhat we need is enlightened support which is\r\ntransparent and targeted at ensuring durable peace and\r\nstability. What we require is support not compromised\r\nby tactical considerations which are short-sighted and\r\nlikely to aggravate already existing problems. Coddling\r\nunaccountable Governments would not promote peace\r\nin the long run and would not bring about durable\r\nstability.\r\nOurs is a region which has suffered so much,\r\namong other things because of strategic considerations\r\nwhich made expedient the propping up of\r\nunaccountable and authoritarian regimes. The result of\r\nall that has been disastrous for the region. Peace and\r\nstability in the Horn of Africa, as is true in all parts of\r\nthe world, is dependent in a critical manner on the\r\ncreation of conditions for good governance. This is a\r\nvalue which ought to be universally applied, including\r\nin our subregion. Durable peace demands it. The\r\nwelfare of the people of our subregion makes it\r\nimperative.\r\nEthiopia will leave no stone unturned for peace in\r\nour subregion and in Africa as a whole. The effort we\r\nhave been making for peace in Somalia within the\r\nframework of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment is being made in that spirit. It is also in\r\nthat same spirit that we shall continue to do our share\r\nfor peace and national reconciliation in the Sudan.\r\nMost of all, we draw satisfaction from the fact that we\r\nhave managed to come out of a war that was imposed\r\non us. For our part, we are determined to leave behind\r\nthe crisis we had with Eritrea. We shall remain\r\ncommitted to the peace process until its conclusion.\r\nIt has always been our conviction that it is in the\r\nvital interest of Ethiopia to nurture peace in our\r\nsubregion. That is required by the war we have to wage\r\nagainst poverty, which is the only real enemy we have.\r\nBut the promotion of the cause of peace in the Horn of\r\nAfrica has not been that easy. Our subregion is an area\r\nof the world that has long been vulnerable to terrorist\r\nactivities. Ours has been an area that, due in part to the\r\nprevalence of poverty, has been taken advantage of\r\nvery recklessly. My own country has been among those\r\nto have suffered as a result. This is a challenge that we\r\nstill have to contend with, and which we still continue\r\nto face. This first-hand experience of ours put us in a\r\nposition where we can deeply share the anguish of the\r\npeople of the United States over the 11 September\r\nterrorist attack, which we have condemned vehemently.\r\nAs we mark the first anniversary of that evil deed, we\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nwish once again to express our solidarity with the\r\nUnited States and its people.\r\nIt is our conviction that success in the fight\r\nagainst international terrorism requires the genuine\r\ncooperation and solidarity of the entire international\r\ncommunity, no matter who might be the target of such\r\nterrorism. All those who directly or indirectly support\r\nand encourage terrorism should be held accountable.\r\nResources made available to terrorist groups, in\r\nwhatever guise, should not be tolerated regardless of\r\nthe area where this is taking place. In short, what is\r\nrequired is zero tolerance for terrorism regardless of its\r\nintended targets. It is not without reason that I am\r\nreiterating this point. For us in Ethiopia, terrorism is\r\nnot a theoretical threat. It is a practical and immediate\r\nthreat that we have had to face both before and after 11\r\nSeptember, including most recently. It is our earnest\r\nhope that the international community will do whatever\r\nis necessary to eliminate this scourge. We also hope\r\nthat there will be better days ahead, when we will all\r\nconcentrate on addressing the challenges that trouble\r\nour planet.\r\nI would like to conclude by renewing Ethiopia’s\r\ncommitment to the United Nations and to what it\r\nstands for. We wish to see the United Nations become\r\nan even a more effective universal Organization and a\r\nmore forceful and faithful custodian of the principles of\r\ninternational law. Our hope and our dream is that the\r\nUnited Nations will be an even more robust universal\r\nOrganization catering to the legitimate interests of both\r\nbig and small counties. We in Ethiopia will continue to\r\ncontribute our share to the greater nurturing of\r\nmultilateralism and to making the United Nations an\r\neffective custodian of those values.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Roberto Tovar Faja, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Worship of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Tovar Faja (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan, and through\r\nhim the Czech Republic, on his well-deserved election\r\nto preside over the work of this session of the General\r\nAssembly. Allow me also to congratulate Switzerland\r\non its recent admission to membership of the United\r\nNations and to congratulate the Republic of Timor-\r\nLeste on its imminent admission.\r\nFifty-eight years ago, the founders of the\r\nOrganization undertook to promote social progress and\r\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom.\r\nUnquestionably, the main purpose of the United\r\nNations is the promotion of justice and well-being for\r\nall. We must reaffirm that commitment today. We must\r\ndedicate ourselves to building a more just, free,\r\nharmonious and happy society. We must indeed draw\r\nthe maximum advantage from the benefits of joint\r\naction and cooperation in order to create a world of\r\nmutual advantage. As stated in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, we have a collective responsibility to\r\nuphold the principles of human dignity and equality at\r\nthe global level.\r\nHowever, we are still very far from reaching that\r\ngoal. In the last 10 years, more than 3.5 million people\r\nhave died in civil wars. One billion three hundred and\r\neighty million people live in extreme poverty, and 854\r\nmillion do not know how to read or write. Democracy,\r\njustice and the enjoyment of civil and political rights\r\nare far from being universal. We believe that we need\r\nto address the miserable and alarming situation of the\r\nworld’s children. More than 30,000 children die every\r\nday of diseases that are easily preventable. There are\r\nmore than 300,000 child soldiers in the world. More\r\nthan 150 million children suffer from malnutrition due\r\nto a lack of food, and many millions go without\r\nschooling. This situation is as serious as — or more\r\nserious than — the effects of terrorism, which are\r\nthemselves abominable. However, these problems do\r\nnot draw the public’s attention and are relegated to a\r\nsecondary place on the world’s agenda.\r\nWe have stopped half way in our struggle to\r\ncreate a better world. Many examples attest to this\r\nbitter fact. It is right for us to celebrate the holding of\r\nthe first elections after an armed conflict or the end of\r\na dictatorship. However, those are just the first steps\r\ndown the path of a democratic way of life. Unless the\r\nUnited Nations commits itself to ensuring the\r\nsustainability of democracy, elections, regardless of\r\ntheir inherent value, will not necessarily mean a victory\r\nin the fight for human rights. Democracy must be an\r\ninstrument for attaining equitable development and\r\ncreating favourable conditions for peoples who invest\r\ntheir hopes in it.\r\nThe sustainability of democracy can be\r\nsafeguarded though the promotion of the fundamental\r\nsocial values of dialogue, harmony and reconciliation.\r\nThat is also done by combating extreme poverty and\r\nthe growing economic gap between various social\r\ngroups, which are ills that weaken the social fabric and\r\nerode confidence in political institutions. Financial\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\ncrises foster conditions favourable to the existence of\r\nextremist and opportunist groups seeking to overthrow\r\ndemocratic Governments. Greater international\r\ncooperation for development is necessary to\r\nconsolidate democracy. It is for that reason that we\r\nurgently call upon developed nations to implement the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, and in particular to fulfil their\r\ncommitment to increase official development\r\nassistance. Costa Rica fully supports United Nations\r\nefforts to promote and strengthen democracy. But we\r\nalso emphasize that the United Nations should not give\r\nany less attention to the creation of the economic and\r\nsocial conditions that will help to strengthen and\r\npreserve democratic institutions throughout the world.\r\nWe also believe that globalization, with its rapid\r\ndevelopment of information and communication\r\ntechnologies and growing economic and commercial\r\ninterdependence, offers us tremendous opportunities\r\nfor economic and social development. We must\r\ncertainly take advantage of those opportunities to\r\ncreate a better world for all. However, globalization\r\nalso poses serious dangers. Structural barriers,\r\nfinancial imbalances and the lack of capital for\r\nproductive and social investment can cause the\r\neconomic collapse of entire regions. Subsidies,\r\nrestricted access to international markets and capital\r\nflight distort free competition. Globalization may\r\nwiden the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest\r\nsectors of society. The digital divide may exclude the\r\nmost vulnerable from the benefits of the modern\r\neconomy and cast a long shadow over the futures of\r\nthose left behind. It is essential that we make greater\r\nefforts to protect the most vulnerable groups and\r\nnations.\r\nThe United Nations must call on the developed\r\ncountries to open their markets and to abolish\r\nsubsidies, thus enabling developing countries to have\r\naccess to the benefits of globalization. Thus, in\r\ncombating inequality and extreme poverty, we will\r\nbuild more equitable and just societies.\r\nHuman dignity has been championed ever since\r\nthe founding of the United Nations. Government\r\ncorruption, in all its forms and at all levels, is a\r\ngenuine breach of human rights. It is outrageous that\r\nunjust leaders should enrich themselves by corrupt\r\nmeans and thus impoverish their peoples. It is\r\nscandalous to see how certain rulers divert public funds\r\nto their private accounts while reducing their peoples to\r\nthe most appalling poverty. At the same time, the\r\nGovernments of some States Members of the United\r\nNations fuel corruption by granting tax deductions for\r\nbribes offered abroad. There are even some Member\r\nStates that protect corrupt leaders under the guise of\r\nbanking secrecy. The United Nations should forbid all\r\nsuch acts and prevent the granting of amnesty, asylum\r\nand travel visas to those who seek to evade justice.\r\nThe protection of human rights may be weakened\r\nwithout multilateral protection, monitoring and\r\nsanctions mechanisms. Costa Rica advocates the\r\ncreation of a new generation of human rights\r\nmechanisms to provide greater protection to all\r\nindividuals. This effort has already born its first fruit in\r\nthe form of a draft optional protocol to the Convention\r\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\r\nTreatment or Punishment. That legal instrument,\r\nrecently adopted by the Economic and Social Council,\r\nwill be submitted to the General Assembly for\r\nconsideration in the next few days. I urge all States\r\nactively to support the draft as a sign of their\r\nunequivocal commitment to human rights and to the\r\nprimacy of the dignity and integrity of all human\r\nbeings.\r\nWe welcome the recent entry into force of the\r\nRome Statute establishing the International Criminal\r\nCourt. Human kind at last has an effective, independent\r\nand impartial judicial organ with jurisdiction to try the\r\nmost serious crimes against human dignity. We must\r\nnot weaken it.\r\nWhile the United Nations upholds the principle of\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, requiring just\r\nmeans and institutions to resolve differences, the\r\nInternational Court of Justice — the United Nations\r\nmain judicial organ and guarantor of international law,\r\nresponsible for ensuring the rule of law in international\r\nrelations and for preventing arbitrary and casuistic\r\ninterpretations of legal norms — has become a purely\r\nrhetorical device. Very few States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations have accepted its mandatory\r\njurisdiction without reservation, while others have\r\nmade the situation even worse by unjustifiably\r\nwithdrawing or modifying their acceptance of its\r\njurisdiction. Only 12 nations accept the mandatory\r\njurisdiction of the Court without reservation or\r\ncondition. To ignore the authority of the highest\r\njudicial organ of the society of nations is tantamount to\r\nclosing the door to justice and endangers the integrity\r\nof the international legal order.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nWhat alternative is there for nations if they\r\ncannot rely on judicial bodies to settle their\r\ndifferences? The only alternative is force. It is essential\r\nfor all States Members of the United Nations to accept\r\nwithout condition the obligatory jurisdiction of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. Only thus will we be\r\nable to create a more just, peaceful and secure world.\r\nA more just world will necessarily be more\r\npeaceful. Justice demands respect for others and for\r\ntheir freedom — in other words, tolerance. Peace in\r\nmany regions of the world is seriously threatened by\r\nintolerance. In the Middle East, the rights of the\r\npeoples of Israel and Palestine are being violated. The\r\nintolerance of one leader is today making a country\r\nlike Iraq the possible setting for endlessly bitter war.\r\nHow different the situation would be if it had a fair\r\nGovernment respectful of human rights. The world has\r\nalso witnessed with concern the growing dispute\r\nbetween India and Pakistan and the threat of nuclear\r\nwar in that region.\r\nMy country would like to see greater tolerance\r\nprevail in the Taiwan Straits. We hope to see a just\r\nsettlement that would fulfil the desires of the entire\r\nChinese people. Costa Rica has historically enjoyed\r\nand continues to enjoy close friendly relations with the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Creative agreements\r\nhave been reached in many international organizations\r\nto permit the participation of the Republic of China in\r\ntheir work. The world would be a far more peaceful\r\nplace if we were able to find an innovative accord to\r\nallow that country and its people to be represented with\r\ndignity in this and other international organizations.\r\nWhile it is a principle of the United Nations to\r\nprevent violence and to achieve lasting and stable\r\npeace, there are Governments that transfer weapons to\r\nrebel and terrorist groups and States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations that scorn efforts being made for\r\ndisarmament and the reduction of military expenditure.\r\nWe call for the adoption of a legally binding\r\nframework convention to regulate the arms trade. Our\r\nexperience as a disarmed nation has taught us that not\r\nspending on weapons is the best decision for those\r\ncountries that are truly committed to the well-being of\r\ntheir peoples.\r\nWe urge the nuclear States truly to commit\r\nthemselves to disarmament negotiations. We deem it\r\nnecessary to adopt a comprehensive convention to\r\nprohibit the use of nuclear weapons. In the meantime,\r\nall States must renounce the development of new\r\nnuclear weapons and ratify the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe cannot commit ourselves only half-way to\r\nhuman dignity, equality and justice. We must not allow\r\nour children, the future generation, to be able to\r\ncondemn us for doublespeak. If we can do that, we will\r\nbe making a true contribution to their inheritance of a\r\nbetter world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and African\r\nIntegration of the Niger, Her Excellency Mrs. Aïchatou\r\nMindaoudou.\r\nMrs. Mindaoudou (Niger) (spoke in French):\r\nMy delegation would like to say that the leadership\r\nshown by the President in presiding over this session\r\nmakes us confident that our deliberations will continue\r\nin a spirit of dynamism and optimism for the\r\ndevelopment of international relations. Niger is very\r\nhappy to convey to the President and to other members\r\nof the Bureau of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly our heartfelt congratulations.\r\nWe remain convinced that President Kavan will\r\nfollow up the remarkable work done by his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of\r\nKorea, with the same human qualities for the good of\r\nthe international community as a whole.\r\nI wish to reiterate to our brother, His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations, the congratulations of the people of Niger for\r\nthe prestige and effectiveness of his deeply appreciated\r\nwork done in the service of humanity.\r\nI also wish to congratulate the Swiss\r\nConfederation on becoming a new Member, and Timor-\r\nLeste, as an imminent Member of the Organization. We\r\nare convinced that their participation will help enrich\r\nour debates.\r\nThe American people have been mourning the\r\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 for a year now. The\r\nwhole world has taken full measure of the threat that\r\nterrorism poses to peace and security. In Niger, we\r\ncannot stress the fact enough that, in order to be\r\neffective, the fight against terrorism must avoid taking\r\na piecemeal approach. It must be long term and it must\r\nbe conducted within the framework of international\r\nlegality, which is epitomized by the United Nations.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nNiger agrees with the provisions of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and\r\nit is firmly committed to all subregional, regional and\r\ninternational initiatives aimed at combating terrorism\r\nin all its forms.\r\nAt the same time, in order to succeed in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, we must take into account the need\r\nto develop a more just and equitable economic and\r\npolitical order, since it has been shown that poverty,\r\nignorance, injustice and all kinds of frustrations are\r\nfactors that can produce blind extremism.\r\nSpeaking of international peace and security, I am\r\npleased to recall that Niger is a peaceful country that\r\ncontributes actively to efforts to achieve general and\r\ncomplete disarmament. In that regard, I would like to\r\npoint out that in that field, my country, pursuant to\r\narticle 3 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons, has accepted an agreement with the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, on a system of\r\nmonitoring and safeguards for its uranium production.\r\nRegarding conventional weapons, Niger is happy that\r\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has\r\nadopted a programme of action to combat that scourge.\r\nOur concerns were taken into account in the\r\nBamako Declaration, but there is still work to be done,\r\nparticularly in terms of technical and financial\r\nassistance measures to support disarmament\r\nprogrammes and reintegration programmes for former\r\ncombatants. While it is true that no region of the world\r\nhas been spared, there is no doubt that developing\r\ncountries, particularly African countries, are the ones\r\nsuffering the most from the devastating effects of the\r\nproliferation of light arms and small weapons in terms\r\nof their security, stability and development. That is\r\nwhy the bodies charged with monitoring, detecting and\r\nprosecuting infractions committed along those lines\r\nmust be strengthened.\r\nSince 1994, Niger has had in place the National\r\nCommission for Collecting and Controlling Illicit\r\nWeapons, whose task is to help the political authorities\r\nat the highest level identify, design and put implement\r\nstrategies to fight the proliferation of light weapons.\r\nIn that context, the Government of Niger and the\r\nDepartment for Disarmament Affairs of our\r\nOrganization are cooperating closely for the success of\r\na project to collect illegal small arms and light\r\nweapons for the entire West African subregion. That is\r\na part of the regional and subregional initiatives aimed\r\nat cutting off the illicit movement of small arms and\r\nlight weapons.\r\nThe peace that we wish for Niger is the same\r\npeace we wish for the rest of the world. That is why\r\nour country has always tried to make its modest\r\ncontribution to settling conflicts that threaten peace and\r\nsecurity in Africa and throughout the world. In spite of\r\nour limited resources, we have sent contingents to\r\nLiberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and civilian police officers to\r\nHaiti, Timor and Kosovo, to support the efforts of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the international community to restore\r\nand consolidate peace.\r\nThe Government of Niger reaffirms its ongoing\r\navailability to send contingents to all United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nFor a few months now the international\r\ncommunity’s attention has been focused on the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, whose peace process is now more\r\nparalysed than ever. Niger wants once again to reaffirm\r\nbefore the Assembly that a permanent settlement of the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict necessarily requires\r\nestablishing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople, including the creation of an independent,\r\nsovereign and viable Palestinian State. On the basis of\r\nthat conviction and in light of all kinds of false starts\r\nthat have characterized the peace process in Palestine\r\nand the Middle East, Niger has made a sovereign\r\ndecision to break off its diplomatic relations with\r\nIsrael, which continues to deny the Palestinian people\r\ntheir legitimate right to self-determination.\r\nIn Western Sahara, the Republic of Niger\r\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations, on one hand,\r\nto enforce the settlement plan and, on the other hand,\r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, in order to\r\nachieve a just and comprehensive settlement of the\r\nconflict. The laudable action of the Secretary-General\r\nand his Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, should be\r\nfollowed up and supported until a positive conclusion\r\nis achieved, in accordance with the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions.\r\nIn that context, we think that United Nations\r\nresolutions on Jammu and Kashmir must be speedily\r\nimplemented so that the Kashmiri people can exercise\r\ntheir right to self-determination, which would allow to\r\ndefuse that hotbed that involves two nuclear States —\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nIndia and Pakistan — and to avoid a serious threat to\r\npeace and security in the South Asia region. Therefore,\r\nNiger, a member of the contact group established by\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, reiterates\r\nthe appeal already made to the two parties to step up\r\ntheir negotiations in order to achieve a peaceful\r\nsettlement of that conflict.\r\nNiger, like almost all African countries, faces a\r\nnumber of major challenges, which require the\r\ninternational community to provide the necessary\r\nsupport to help them in the search for solutions and in\r\nconsolidating their economic renewal programme.\r\nFrom that standpoint, the developmental strategy that\r\nwe have implemented gives priority to the culture and\r\nthe promotion of good governance through a good-\r\nconduct mechanism and public affairs management that\r\nfocuses on concerns such as transparency and civil\r\nsociety participation in all socio-economic decisions.\r\nThis is the time to sincerely thanks all the bilateral and\r\nmultilateral partners of Niger, particularly the United\r\nNations institutions, for having been kind enough to\r\ncontinue to support the efforts of my country to create\r\nan institutional environment conducive to giving us\r\nsocial peace. That assistance is much appreciated and\r\nis necessary in this critical phase of the national\r\nconstruction process.\r\nIn economic terms, never before has mankind had\r\nso much wealth and potential overall to generate\r\ncommon benefit. The positive world economic\r\nsituation could give us hope to establish a more just\r\neconomic order that would be more conducive to\r\npoverty reduction. In that regard, Niger welcomes the\r\nnew partnership, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), and we believe that that\r\nprogramme, which crystallizes the hopes of our\r\ncontinent today, must be aimed at bringing together the\r\nnecessary conditions and means for the effective\r\nparticipation of all African countries to the\r\nmultidimensional developmental process within the\r\nframework of the African Union.\r\nPoverty is an affront that can no longer be\r\ntolerated in a world of abundance that has the means to\r\nvanquish it if there is the necessary political will.\r\nToday, we must note that 52 per cent of people who\r\nlive on less than a dollar a day are found in Africa,\r\nwhich is the most indebted part of the world.\r\nA clear look must be taken at globalization,\r\nwhich in the 1990s gave rise to hopes but today is a\r\nsource of concern because of the growing inequalities\r\nit is creating. In less than a year, we have discussed\r\nglobal problems four times, and we know the true\r\nremedies. We need a more elevated concept of\r\ninternational cooperation that draws its essence from\r\nstrategic partnership. However, we can rejoice in the\r\nunanimous will that the international community\r\naffirmed in adopting the Johannesburg Plan of Action\r\nin September.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to HIV/AIDS, held in July 2001, demonstrated\r\neloquently our degree of awareness of the terrible\r\ndanger that that disease represents for the human\r\nspecies. The establishment of a special fund to fight\r\nAIDS is an important step in the world crusade against\r\nAIDS and other major epidemics. Progress must be\r\nmade within the framework of initiatives undertaken by\r\nthe world Summits held at Cairo, at Copenhagen and at\r\nBeijing.\r\nMy country expects a greater degree of solidarity\r\nfrom the industrialized countries, particularly with\r\nregard to increasing the volume of official development\r\nassistance, a traditional development source. At the\r\nsame time, we must unite our efforts to mobilize\r\nfinancial resources and to establish a humanitarian\r\nfund under United Nations auspices. It is indispensable\r\nand urgent that we reverse the trend of declining\r\nofficial development assistance, which, the Assembly\r\nwill recall, is at its lowest level in 50 years. In fact,\r\nmany difficulties have conspired to keep our countries\r\nat the bottom of the human development index. The\r\nstate of poverty affects 63 per cent of our compatriots,\r\nand 34 per cent of them live below the extreme poverty\r\nline. Those populations, deprived of minimal basic\r\nsocial services, are the victims of a continued\r\ndeterioration in their standard of living.\r\nThe growing scarcity of financial resources has\r\ncaused, among other things, a drastic decline in public\r\ninvestment, particularly in the social sectors, thus\r\ndepriving 80 per cent of Niger’s rural citizens of basic\r\nsocial benefits. Niger has decided to undertake\r\nmeasures to reverse that trend through its poverty\r\nreduction strategy, which was formulated and\r\nimplemented after a participative process. Its goal is to\r\nsubstantially reduce the suffering of 80 per cent of the\r\npopulation. That strategy is now the only frame of\r\nreference for Niger’s economic, financial and social\r\npolicies.\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nThis year, under the direct supervision of the\r\nPresident of the Republic, we have launched an\r\nextensive programme, called Special Programme 2001,\r\nwhich consists of building 1,000 classrooms, 1,000\r\ndispensaries and 100 mini-dams to fight poverty. A\r\ngood part — more than 80 per cent — of that operation\r\nhas already been completed.\r\nI should also like to express again from this\r\npodium our deep appreciation for the support that our\r\ndevelopmental partners have continued to give us for\r\nthe implementation of our National Framework\r\nProgramme to fight poverty, which Niger formulated\r\nand which is among our highest priorities. However,\r\nthe crucial problem of African debt, which is\r\nannihilating all our development efforts, calls for an\r\neffort by the entire international community to help us\r\nto implement — without delay or any conditions other\r\nthan those of good governance — satisfactory policies\r\nand mechanisms for its solution.\r\nThe United Nations remains the best instrument\r\nfor helping us realize the new world order to which we\r\nall aspire, so long as we carry forward the so-called\r\nquiet revolution begun by the Secretary-General four\r\nyears ago. In conclusion, I should like to express the\r\nfull confidence that Niger and its people place in the\r\nUnited Nations, which remains an institution of hope\r\nbased on the principles of justice, equity, peace and\r\nprogress.\r\nAgenda item 119 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/57/390/Add.2)\r\nThe Acting President: Before I give the floor to\r\nthe next speaker, I should like to inform members that,\r\nsince the issuance of document A/57/390 and\r\nAddendum 1, Chad has made the necessary payment to\r\nreduce its arrears below the amount specified in Article\r\n19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of that information?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: That information will be\r\nreflected in document A/57/390/Add.2, to be issued\r\ntomorrow morning.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Joseph Philippe Antonio, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Haiti.\r\nMr. Antonio (Haiti) (spoke in French): On behalf\r\nof the President of the Republic of Haiti, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, I should first of\r\nall like to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. He can be assured of the Haitian\r\ndelegation’s full support in the exercise of his duties. I\r\nshould also like to congratulate his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, on the talent he\r\ndemonstrated in conducting the work of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the Organization, for his\r\nceaseless efforts to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn addition, I wish to welcome the Swiss\r\nConfederation and East Timor to the Organization as\r\nStates Members. Undoubtedly, their presence in this\r\ninstitution will contribute significantly to the pursuit of\r\nthe noble objectives of the United Nations.\r\nThe entire world has just commemorated the first\r\nanniversary of the tragedy of 11 September 2001. The\r\nGovernment and the people of Haiti again express their\r\nsympathy to the people and the Government of the\r\nUnited States. We continue to share the distress of all\r\nthe families of the victims of that barbarity, which\r\ntouched all races, cultures and nations of the world. It\r\nis humanity that has been struck, and humanity will\r\nalways remember that sad event.\r\nThe Government of Haiti reaffirms its\r\ncondemnation of terrorism, one of the most flagrant\r\nforms of human rights violations. Terrorism represents\r\na grave danger, and we must unite all our efforts to\r\ncombat it in all its forms and manifestations. In that\r\nconnection, my Government reaffirms its commitment\r\nto supporting the relevant resolutions of the\r\nOrganization as an expression of its respect for the\r\nprecepts of international law.\r\nReform of the Security Council, which has been\r\ndiscussed for some time, is, more than ever before, of\r\nthe highest importance. Haiti continues to call for more\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nopenness in its operations and for greater participation\r\nin its decision-making.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations, ratified by all\r\nStates Members, evokes the sacred principles of\r\nmaintaining international peace and security as well as\r\nthe right of peoples to determine their own future with\r\nthe leaders they choose.\r\nIn that connection, the Government of Haiti\r\nexpresses its grave concern at the escalating violence in\r\nthe Middle East, and particularly the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict. The Haitian Government supports the creation\r\nof a Palestinian State, while recognizing Israel’s right\r\nto exist within safe and internationally recognized\r\nborders. We call on the parties to settle their\r\ndifferences peacefully through dialogue and diplomatic\r\nmeans.\r\nIn the same spirit, we appreciate the negotiations\r\ninitiated between the two Republics of Korea, and we\r\nare in favour of a rapprochement between the\r\npopulations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\r\nDespite Iraq’s acceptance of the unconditional\r\nreturn of the inspectors, the Haitian Government is\r\nconcerned at developments in the Iraqi situation. In\r\norder to deal effectively with this problem, the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions must be applied.\r\nRegionalization is an important tool to facilitate\r\npartnerships among States as they strive to ensure the\r\nwell-being of their people. In that context, my country\r\nis gratified by its full integration within the Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM), where it will contribute to\r\nthe socio-economic development of the region.\r\nHumanity today is facing serious challenges,\r\nincluding poverty, the AIDS pandemic, drug abuse,\r\nhunger and illiteracy. The population of the least\r\ndeveloped countries is about 614 million, one third of\r\nwhom have to survive on less than $1 per day.\r\nCharacterized by weak institutions and an inadequate\r\ninfrastructure, those countries are affected by many\r\ndifferent problems. The sub-human conditions under\r\nwhich many of their people live are a source of social\r\ntension. Poverty increases in proportion as capital\r\ndecreases.\r\nWe returned from the Doha, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg summits with renewed hope.\r\nExpectations are great, in keeping with the promises\r\nmade. It is not enough, however, to hope for\r\nsustainable development. We must have the will to\r\nimplement measures to attain it and respect the\r\ncommitments undertaken. Leaders must take action to\r\nensure sustainable development, which is in the best\r\ninterests of our peoples.\r\nEducation and training can roll back poverty, free\r\npeople from ignorance and put them on track to social\r\nand economic progress. On the basis of that conviction,\r\nthe President of Haiti, Mr. Jean Bertrand Aristide,\r\nofficially launched, on 7 September 2001, a national\r\nliteracy campaign, to which he attributes overriding\r\nimportance. The goal of this large-scale and ambitious\r\ninitiative is to help 3 million people learn to read\r\nbefore 1 January 2004, when we will celebrate the\r\nbicentennial of our independence. The head of State is\r\ncounting on the active participation of our literate\r\ncitizens in the work of national construction.\r\nGlaring injustices are built into our country’s\r\ntraditional socio-economic system. These injustices are\r\nresponsible for wide disparities between the various\r\nsocial sectors — a situation that contributes in large\r\npart to the anachronistic nature of the general\r\nstructures of our country, which is the only least\r\ndeveloped country in the Americas.\r\nAgainst that background, the Government has\r\nbeen doing its utmost to fight the financial embargo,\r\nwhich the international community imposed in\r\nresponse to the controversy of the elections of 1 May\r\n2000. Unfortunately, it is the most vulnerable sectors of\r\nsociety that are penalized by those unjustified\r\nsanctions.\r\nThe recent adoption by the Permanent Council of\r\nthe Organization of American States (OAS) of\r\nresolution 822 in support of strengthening the\r\ndemocratic process in Haiti has opened up encouraging\r\nprospects for our country in beginning to move towards\r\nnormalization.\r\nMy Government is determined to stay the course\r\nin ensuring that elections remain a crucial element of\r\nthat advance. We have great expectations of the\r\ninternational community’s support in this regard. In\r\nthis context, we are hoping for assistance, and for\r\nelection observers in particular. At the same time, in\r\nthe spirit of resolution 822, we appeal once again as a\r\nmatter of urgency for an end to the financial embargo.\r\nThe adoption of OAS resolution 822, which\r\ndemonstrates the commitment to Haiti of a number of\r\nOAS member countries, constitutes a step in the right\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\ndirection. We would like to draw attention to that\r\nexpression of fraternal solidarity.\r\nWe are also grateful to the States members of\r\nOAS whose joint efforts made possible the adoption of\r\nthat consensus resolution, in particular the Federal\r\nRepublic of Brazil, which currently coordinates the\r\nLatin American Integration Association and OAS\r\ngroups, and the Central American countries. We would\r\nlike to make special mention of our neighbour, the\r\nDominican Republic, which has continued to reaffirm\r\nits solidarity with Haiti during this difficult period —\r\nsolidarity that is manifested in different ways wherever\r\nthe Haitian cause is discussed and needs to be\r\ndefended. Above all, we would like to thank our sister\r\nnations in CARICOM, whose delegations to the OAS\r\nco-sponsored, with Haiti, the draft resolution, thereby\r\nmaintaining the spirit of fraternal generosity, as is their\r\ncustom.\r\nDuring the crisis, a number of countries Members\r\nof the United Nations, in particular Japan and Cuba,\r\ncontinued to cooperate with Haiti. Despite the embargo\r\nand the other difficulties that it has to deal with, Cuba\r\nis enthusiastically pursuing a programme of\r\ncooperation with Haiti, in particular in the areas of\r\nhealth and agriculture. The Haitian people owe a debt\r\nof gratitude to all of those countries for their\r\nexpressions of solidarity in our quest for dignity and\r\ncollective affirmation.\r\nOAS resolution 822 provides the entire nation\r\nwith an opportunity; it holds out the potential for\r\nprogress for all the Haitian people. In the context of the\r\nforthcoming celebrations of two centuries of\r\nindependence, Haiti needs to galvanize its collective\r\nenergy so that we can build our national home. To that\r\nend, the Haitian Government will hold an ongoing\r\ndialogue and continue to practise openness and\r\nflexibility, as called for by President Aristide. In that\r\nspirit, despite our well-known scarcity of resources, it\r\nhas decided to compensate the victims of 17 December\r\n2001, in accordance with OAS resolutions 806 and\r\n822. Likewise, President Aristide will continue to call\r\non the opposition to observe a patriotic truce in order\r\nto facilitate the rehabilitation of the country and\r\nsupport the Haitian people.\r\nIn this context, my country appeals once again for\r\nus to place human beings at the forefront of relations\r\namong various countries. This planet — the theatre of\r\nour common destiny — can thus become a world fit for\r\nall of its inhabitants through the advent of a\r\n“humanism without borders”. On that basis of that\r\nconviction, the Republic of Haiti, on the eve of the\r\nbicentenary of our independence, invites the\r\ninternational community to help us to set in motion a\r\nprocess that will enable us to overcome the shocking\r\nreversals of the past and bring us into the modern\r\nworld.\r\nI hope that all of the nations of the world share\r\nthese exalted hopes and that they will join us in\r\ncelebrating this important event, to which the\r\nGovernment and the people of Haiti invite them, in\r\nJanuary 2004.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Norman José Caldera Cardenal,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Caldera Cardenal (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I should like first of all to congratulate\r\nMr. Kavan on his election to the presidency.\r\nOn 21 March at Monterrey, Mexico, the President\r\nof Nicaragua, Enrique Bolaños Geyer, announced that\r\n“a process of moral renewal has been launched in\r\nNicaragua, with a crusade against public and private\r\ncorruption”.\r\nOn that same day, the President also announced\r\nthat, in the spirit of the new era of moral renewal,\r\n“a Nicaraguan judge has just found three former\r\nofficials of the previous Government and three\r\nother people guilty of acts of corruption that\r\nimpoverished our people. The judge left pending\r\nthe case against former President Alemán and\r\neight other officials of the previous Government”.\r\nPresident Bolaños went on to say:\r\n“With a view to continuing my policy of zero\r\ntolerance of corruption, I must return to my\r\ncountry as soon as possible to contribute, with\r\njustice and transparency, to the historic landmark\r\nconstituted by this bold decision.”\r\nA few days ago, in a similar case, another\r\ncourageous Nicaraguan judge sentenced members of\r\nthe former President’s immediate family to jail.\r\nToday, I have come before this General Assembly\r\non behalf of an entire people to reaffirm, in deed,\r\nNicaragua’s commitment to governance, transparency,\r\naccountability and to the principles of the rule of law.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nThere is much at stake today in Nicaragua. Not\r\nonly must we punish corrupt officials and recover for\r\nour country Government money that was diverted and\r\nlaundered, but also the results of our efforts will be\r\ncrucial to the struggle waged by other peoples of our\r\nregion and of the world against this scourge.\r\nNicaragua’s success will be an incentive for the entire\r\ninternational community. The failure of transparency in\r\nNicaragua would set a bad precedent for humankind.\r\nWe have not fought this battle alone. The support\r\nof more than 84 per cent of our population has been\r\ncoupled with the moral and economic support of many\r\ncountries, embodying the democratic values shared by\r\nus, the peoples of the United Nations. To them, to the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nto the international organizations that have supported\r\nus, we extend our sincere gratitude.\r\nIn order to ensure that the changes we have made\r\nare irreversible, we will need sustained and adequate\r\nsupport. In this way, we will preserve the great moral\r\nheritage of humankind — democracy exercised with\r\nhonesty and accountability.\r\nAs a part of this great heritage, we are today\r\ndiscussing human development, conceived as the\r\nState’s ultimate purpose, to be attained through\r\ndemocratic governance, economic growth and social\r\nequity. We understand governance to be the result of\r\ndoing things correctly in the political sphere —\r\ntransparency, human rights and sovereignty. We see\r\ngrowth as the result of doing the right things in the\r\neconomic and financial spheres, foreign exchange,\r\nfiscal and monetary policies and competition. And we\r\nunderstand equity as the result of doing things right in\r\nthe social sphere — namely, in education, health,\r\nhousing and gender equality.\r\nProgress in bringing together these three elements\r\nthat comprise human development will not be possible\r\nuntil corruption is rooted out. By its very nature, the\r\nscourge of corruption has an impact that transcends\r\nnational borders. In this regard, we offer our full\r\nsupport to the work being carried out by the special\r\ncommittee responsible for negotiating a United Nations\r\nconvention against corruption. From this forum, we\r\nappeal to the international community to commit itself\r\nto the broadest possible mutual assistance and\r\ncooperation in investigating or prosecuting acts of\r\ncorruption.\r\nTerrorism is just as abhorrent as corruption. This\r\nmonth we remember with anguish the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember, when thousands of innocent people\r\nperished, many of them heroically. This tragedy, like\r\nall terrorist acts, must never be forgotten. At the same\r\ntime, international cooperation to deal with such crimes\r\nmust remain permanently on our agenda. It is essential\r\nthat we coordinate activities to prevent and punish such\r\nterrorist activities, which cause so much pain and\r\nsuffering, with the full force of the law.\r\nNicaragua wishes to reaffirm once again its\r\nunconditional support for United Nations activities to\r\ncombat international terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. In Nicaragua, we have already set in\r\nplace a National Plan against Terrorism and Related\r\nCrimes, designed to strengthen cooperation among\r\ninstitutions, and with the aim of preventing, combating\r\nand eliminating this scourge, and complying with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nThe case of Iraq is a challenge and a test for the\r\nentire multilateral system that we have been\r\nconstructing. It is up to us to either help strengthen it\r\nor help to weaken and fracture it. While it is true that\r\nwe are all in favour of multilateral action, it is also\r\nundeniable that inertia and inaction undermine\r\nconfidence in our collective will. The multilateral\r\nsystem must demonstrate the dynamism which is its\r\nvery raison d’être by taking joint, concerted and timely\r\naction to resolve conflicts.\r\nWe wish to see a system capable of reacting with\r\nspecific, timely and effective measures to dangers that\r\nthreaten international peace and security, a system that\r\ndoes not find itself overtaken by circumstances.\r\nNicaragua takes the view that the immediate and\r\nunconditional return of United Nations weapons\r\ninspectors to Iraq, in a climate of complete\r\ncooperation, can only be regarded as an important part\r\nof a greater effort aimed at the elimination of all kinds\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, within the context of\r\nthe global interests of the international community and\r\nin compliance with all pertinent Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations is also part of\r\nthe desire to respond effectively. Reform basically\r\nrevolves around new organizational and administrative\r\nstructures, which, without a doubt, have gradually\r\nenabled the United Nations to act with greater unity of\r\npurpose, coherence and flexibility. Nicaragua, like the\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nSecretary-General, believes that there is still great\r\npotential for progress, and we must all ensure that the\r\nOrganization’s work programme includes the priorities\r\nset out in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nNo reform of the United Nations would be\r\ncomplete without the long-awaited expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council in order to enable it to respond fully\r\nand effectively to current and future needs. Similarly,\r\nwe must pursue efforts to revitalize the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council in\r\norder to empower the Organization fully to assume its\r\nresponsibilities, as enshrined in the Charter. Nicaragua\r\nshares the interest of Member States in strengthening\r\nthe Organization, with a view to optimizing its efforts\r\nto maintain international peace and security, prevent\r\nconflicts, promote sustainable development and\r\neradicate poverty.\r\nThe recent World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment filled us with hope and, at the same time,\r\nuneasiness. On the one hand, we saw the degree of\r\nattention being focused on the problem of\r\nenvironmental degradation. But, on the other hand, the\r\npath to achieving the balance between development\r\nand environment is still long and arduous, particularly\r\nfor the least developed countries. Before us lies the\r\nchallenge of generating greater wealth and more jobs\r\nwithout harming our environment. We cannot achieve\r\nthis without the support of the developed countries,\r\nwhich must help pay the price of the benefits they reap\r\nfrom our efforts. Therefore, I wish to recall the\r\nMonterrey consensus, where we urged those developed\r\ncountries that have not yet done so to adopt specific\r\nmeasures to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross\r\ndomestic product for official development assistance\r\n(ODA) to the developing countries.\r\nNicaragua is aware that violence, civil and\r\ninternational wars, the scourge of acquired\r\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), drought and\r\npoverty are the main problems afflicting the African\r\ncontinent in recent years. However, we note with\r\nconcern that international cooperation and assistance to\r\nAfrica are diminishing. The efforts of African\r\nGovernments to achieve economic growth and alleviate\r\npoverty must be matched.\r\nDevelopment efforts have also been given direct\r\nexpression in Central America, where we have reached\r\nimportant agreements and taken decisions that today\r\nenable us to say that our region is embarking on a new\r\nera in its history. On 21 June last, in the city of\r\nGranada, Nicaragua, we held the Twenty-First\r\nOrdinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government\r\nof Central America. This provided the opportunity to\r\nreaffirm our commitment to moving towards the\r\nconsolidation of a Central American Customs Union,\r\nwhich will become a reality on 31 December 2003. The\r\nCustoms Union was conceived as a means of\r\ncontributing to the economic and social development of\r\nour countries. It will promote smooth interregional\r\ntrade, reduce the costs of transport owing to border\r\ndelays, facilitate the movement of persons and\r\nvehicles, and, at the same time, attract international\r\nbusiness and investment to the region.\r\nNonetheless, the prolonged halt in the\r\ninternational economic recovery was exacerbated in\r\nNicaragua by uncharacteristic problems in the external\r\nsector, owing to the high price of imported oil and the\r\nlowest coffee prices in history.\r\nAccording to data provided by Gabriel Silva,\r\nPresident of the Colombian Coffee Growers’\r\nFederation, five years ago, coffee consumers paid 30\r\nbillion dollars while producers received 12 billion\r\ndollars, or 40 per cent. Today, consumers pay 65 billion\r\ndollars but producers receive only 5.5 billion dollars or\r\nless than 8.5 per cent.\r\nThis critical situation, which is generating\r\nunemployment and hunger in the productive areas of\r\nNicaragua and other producer countries, seems to be\r\ncaused by a cartel of coffee-roasters, a situation that\r\nmust be remedied as soon as possible through measures\r\nto promote competition in consumer markets and on\r\nthe international market.\r\nNicaragua congratulates Switzerland on recently\r\njoining the United Nations as a new Member and\r\nTimor-Leste, which is about to join. Their presence\r\namong us will contribute new ideas and approaches to\r\nstrengthening efforts for a better world, and —\r\nparaphrasing the representative of Switzerland’s\r\nstatement to this General Assembly — will enhance the\r\nuniversality of the United Nations in the best interest of\r\nhumankind.\r\nIn this same connection, my country, aware of the\r\nprinciple of universality and equality that inspired the\r\nUnited Nations, considers it a priority to permit the 23\r\nmillion inhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nto enjoy the universal right to participate in\r\ninternational affairs through its own delegation to the\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nUnited Nations, parallel to and with the same rights of\r\nparticipation as the People’s Republic of China, whose\r\nGovernment has never exercised hegemony over\r\nTaiwan.\r\nNicaragua, as a founding State of this\r\nOrganization, reaffirms its commitment to the Charter\r\nand its aspiration to become a non-permanent member\r\nof the Security Council during the elections to be held\r\nduring the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI spoke earlier of a new era of moral renewal in\r\nNicaragua rooted in the values of the United Nations. I\r\nbelieve that when we speak of strengthening\r\ndemocracy, reforming the Organization, fighting\r\ncorruption, terrorism and drug trafficking, halting the\r\narms race or providing joint, timely and effective\r\nresponses to the dangers which threaten us, we are\r\nreally speaking of one and the same thing: belonging\r\njointly to an Organization that holds and safeguards our\r\ntrust and collective action based on the principles that\r\nunited our peoples on that historic day to create the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to\r\nthe next speaker, I should like to announce that the\r\nreport of the General Committee will be issued\r\ntomorrow morning as document A/57/250. In this\r\ncontext I should like to announce that the General\r\nAssembly will consider that report on Friday, 20\r\nSeptember 2002 in the afternoon, immediately after the\r\nconclusion of the General Debate.\r\nI now call on the chairperson of the delegation of\r\nTurkmenistan, Her Excellency Mrs. Aksoltan Ataeva.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nLet me first of all convey greetings and wishes of\r\npeace and prosperity to the people of your countries\r\nfrom the President of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat\r\nNiyazov.\r\nAllow me to congratulate the President on the\r\noccasion of his election to such a high and responsible\r\npost and wish him success in the organization of the\r\nfruitful work of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI would also like to welcome the Swiss\r\nConfederation and Timor-Leste on their membership\r\nthis year in the United Nations.\r\nFrom the first days of its independent\r\ndevelopment, neutral Turkmenistan has cooperated\r\nclosely with the United Nations and considers that\r\ncooperation the main direction for its foreign policy.\r\nThe key issue for Turkmenistan as a neutral\r\ncountry in such conditions is cooperation  in the name\r\nof peace and security and the well-being and prosperity\r\nof its people. We constantly feel that we have the\r\nsupport of the United Nations for our foreign policy\r\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening these goals. Our\r\ncommitment to these international obligations as a\r\npermanently neutral State remains unchanged.\r\nThe importance of promoting the role of the\r\nUnited Nations is constantly becoming more obvious\r\nagainst the background of current developments of\r\nboth global and regional processes where the\r\nconcentration of collective efforts and the adoption of\r\ndecisions that take into account various interests are\r\nrequired. Turkmenistan stands for strengthening and\r\nbroadening the role of the United Nations in the\r\nsolution not only of global problems, but also in the\r\ncollective discussion of regional issues and for a more\r\nextensive use of the potential of the United Nations and\r\nits institutions in proposing and implementing foreign\r\npolicy initiatives.\r\nWe see huge opportunities in the close\r\ncooperation of the United Nations and its specialized\r\nbodies in the implementation of the large-scale national\r\nprojects. In this context we express our gratitude for\r\nthe cooperation of the leadership of the United Nations\r\nand its specialized agencies, such as the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),\r\nthe United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCCP) and others. In cooperation with\r\nthese agencies, the Government of Turkmenistan is\r\ncarrying out a number of large projects of social and\r\neconomic orientation that are producing specific results\r\nin the areas of health care, social affairs, education,\r\nenvironment and other areas.\r\nMore than a year has passed since the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001, which forced us to\r\nevaluate the issues of security of our people and our\r\nStates through a qualitatively new scale of\r\nmeasurement and has confirmed the necessity to\r\nconsolidate efforts in this direction.\r\nIn this context the region of Central Asia has\r\ncome to the forefront of the world’s attention. In many\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nrespects the prospects for peace and security will\r\ndepend on the way multilateral dialogue develops on\r\nthese issues in the region.\r\nTurkmenistan attaches foremost importance to the\r\nrole of the United Nations in invigorating regional and\r\ninterregional dialogue in the search for solutions to\r\nemerging problems. In this connection I would like to\r\ndraw your attention to the initiative of the President of\r\nTurkmenistan in creating a regional consultative\r\ncouncil of the heads of Government of the countries of\r\nCentral Asia. This would be a high-level interstate\r\nbody for regular consultations and the development of\r\njoint decisions on matters that touch directly upon the\r\ndestinies of the States in the region and the real needs\r\nof their people.\r\nPrimarily, these issues would include trade and\r\neconomic interaction, energy supply, cross-border\r\ntrade, water use, transportation and humanitarian\r\ncooperation. We believe that multilateral consultations\r\non the part of heads of State will contribute to the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of agreed actions by\r\nthe parties, on the basis of mutual interests, and will\r\nenable the creation of a maximally effective system of\r\nrational interaction.\r\nIn this regard, the initiative of the President of\r\nTurkmenistan, Mr. Niyazov, to hold an international\r\nconference in Turkmenistan on economic cooperation\r\nin Central and South Asia, with the participation of\r\nrepresentatives from the region, the United States,\r\nRussia, China, Japan, countries of the European Union,\r\nother interested States, and international financial and\r\neconomic institutions, can be considered to be very\r\ntimely.\r\nSuch a forum will promote a new system of\r\neconomic ties between West and East based on joint\r\nand equal cooperation of States. Its main goal should\r\nbe creation of the most favourable conditions for trade,\r\ninvestment activities, and the introduction of modern\r\ntechnology. Moreover, holding such an international\r\nconference will make it possible for developed\r\ncountries to assess the real potential for industrial and\r\nsocial development of States in Central and South Asia.\r\nThe beginning of work on the trans-Afghan gas\r\npipeline projects using the “Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\r\nPakistan” route is of great importance in developing\r\nregional cooperation. The agreement for the\r\nconstruction of the new gas pipeline was signed in May\r\nof this year, in Islamabad, by the Presidents of\r\nTurkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\r\nTurkmenistan welcomes the interest shown in this\r\nproject by large companies, financial and industrial\r\ngroups, and first of all by the Asian Development\r\nBank, which is taking an active part in the negotiating\r\nprocess for the implementation of the trans-Afghan gas\r\npipeline project.\r\nThe trans-Afghan gas pipeline is a project on an\r\ninternational scale that has colossal social, economic\r\nand political significance, primarily from the point of\r\nview of strengthening stability and security in the\r\nregion. The trans-Afghan gas pipeline, of which more\r\nthan 700 kilometres would be laid through\r\nAfghanistan, has, in addition to its economic\r\ncomponent, an invaluable social and humanitarian\r\nsignificance. The construction of the gas pipeline\r\nwould create jobs for more than 12 thousand Afghans\r\nand would also offer a new social infrastructure for\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nIn this connection we call on the United Nations\r\nto assist us in the effective implementation of this\r\nproject. Turkmenistan had suggested earlier, from the\r\nsame rostrum, the development and adoption, under the\r\nUnited Nations auspices, of an international convention\r\non operating regimes and guarantees for interstate\r\npipelines. Such an instrument would, in our view, allow\r\nus to create a reliable political and legal mechanism for\r\nproviding the safe transportation of critical raw\r\nmaterials to world markets.\r\nTurkmenistan’s foreign policy of positive\r\nneutrality is aimed at ensuring secure development and\r\ncooperation aimed at social revival in the countries of\r\nthe region. This entails the creation of new workplaces\r\nand fighting against poverty, in other words, everything\r\nthat today embraces the human dimension.\r\nTurkmenistan supports the conclusions reached at\r\nthe recent Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. We feel that solutions to current world\r\nproblems, especially in the humanitarian, social and\r\nenvironmental areas, will require a new approach to the\r\nhuman dimension in world politics.\r\nIn the 21st century, the notion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment has acquired a qualitatively new meaning\r\nbased on steady and stable economic growth. On of the\r\nimportant aspects of sustainable development is\r\nmaintaining a balance between, on one hand, industrial\r\n31\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nand technological progress and, on the other, protection\r\nof the environment. The realization of this necessity is\r\nespecially relevant today, when this balance is\r\nbreached throughout the world.\r\nThe international community is striving to\r\nprevent negative, technology-generated consequences\r\non the environment. A vivid example of that is the\r\nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework\r\nConvention on Climate Change. Turkmenistan, having\r\nacceded to that important international instrument, is\r\ntaking an active role in implementing its norms and\r\nprinciples, and is cooperating with international\r\norganizations.\r\nIn the 21st century, the problem connected with\r\nthe huge deposits of hydrocarbon resources in the basin\r\nof the Caspian Sea, which involves not only the\r\ncountries of the region but also many other countries\r\nand multinationals, has come to the attention of the\r\nworld. It is now known that the deposits of oil and gas\r\nin the Caspian Sea are the most important energy\r\nresources of the 21st century. Their efficient\r\ndevelopment, along with the creation of the necessary\r\npipeline infrastructure for bringing energy resources to\r\nthe world markets, will ensure significant economic\r\ngrowth for many States and ensure the well-being of\r\ntheir people. It is obvious that many countries are\r\ninterested in the security of the energy resources\r\ntransit. The United Nations should play an important\r\nrole in this process.\r\nThe first summit meeting of the Caspian littoral\r\nStates in Ashgabat in April of this year, on the\r\ninitiative of the President of Turkmenistan, could be\r\nconsidered as a qualitatively new stage in this process\r\nof agreeing on and developing a mutually acceptable\r\nsolution to the Caspian problem. At this historic\r\nsummit, Presidents expressed the will of their State and\r\npeople, which is to ensure that the Caspian Sea be and\r\nremain a sea of friendship and peace. The result of the\r\nsummit is that the Caspian theme was openly discussed\r\nfor the first time at such a high level. Strong agreement\r\nwas reached that problems are to be resolved\r\npeacefully and constructively. Thus, the first step\r\ntowards a common goal — the determination of the\r\nstatus of the Caspian Sea — was made.\r\nIt is obvious today that effective cooperation and\r\nactivities relating to the Caspian Sea as a whole are\r\ndirectly connected with ensuring stability in the\r\nCaspian region. Turkmenistan hopes that the Caspian\r\nregion will achieve peace, stability and durable\r\ncooperation on the basis of justice and mutual respect.\r\nWe need collective efforts in order to solve the\r\nproblems of the international community. The solution\r\nof these problems is possible, not through collective\r\nefforts alone, but also through the assumption by each\r\nmember of the international community of its\r\nindividual role and responsibilities. This is the logic\r\nguiding the political behaviour of Turkmenistan in its\r\npursuit of the goals of strengthening peace and\r\neconomic, social and cultural development. Our\r\ncountry is always ready for constructive partnership.\r\nThe United Nations can rest assured in that respect.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the\r\nright of reply. I call on the representative of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia) (spoke in English): My\r\ndelegation has asked the floor in the exercise of the\r\nright of reply to the statement made earlier by the\r\nrepresentative of Vanuatu. In this regard, it is for the\r\nbenefit of that delegation, which, unlike the rest of the\r\ninternational community represented in this Assembly,\r\nseems to be particularly ill-informed or perhaps has\r\nchosen not to be informed. I would like to state that the\r\nstatus of Papua as an integral part of the Republic of\r\nIndonesia has long been settled through the mediation\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIndeed, it was within this very body, the General\r\nAssembly, that the settlement was agreed upon. In\r\naddition, I would like to draw your attention to the\r\nfinal communiqués of the two consecutive annual\r\nmeetings of the Pacific Islands Forum — last year, in\r\nNauru, and this year again in Fiji — which recognize\r\nIndonesia as the sovereign entity over the territory, and\r\nexpress support for the special autonomy introduced\r\nfor the province.\r\nConsequently, my delegation is left wondering\r\nhow an active member of the Pacific Island Forum,\r\nsuch as Vanuatu, could make a statement that patently\r\nignores these facts. By doing so, it has also cast\r\naspersion on the wisdom and integrity, not only of the\r\nPacific Island Forum, but also of this body.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of Turkey.\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey) (spoke in English):\r\nDuring his address to the general debate on 16\r\nSeptember, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\n32\r\nA/57/PV.15\r\nRepublic of Armenia, His Excellency Mr. Vartan\r\nOskanian, announced that his country will continue to\r\nwork for the recognition of the Armenian genocide,\r\nprobably implying those who have fallen under\r\nconditions of civil strife, deprivation, havoc and\r\nunspeakable misery brought by the First World War.\r\nWe share a very long — almost one thousand\r\nyears — of common history with the Armenians.\r\nFor more than 900 years, the Turks and other\r\nMuslim races of Anatolia have lived peacefully and\r\nside by side with Armenians in the towns and villages\r\nof Anatolia. The terrible events in question correspond\r\nonly to a thin slice in that long continuum. The Turks\r\nand Armenians should not allow that slice, however\r\naccursed and infamous it may be, to obscure the\r\ninherent richness of their shared history. Nor should we\r\nallow that particular era to rob us of a better future.\r\nYet, Mr. Oskanian does not wish to see that this\r\nwartime tragedy engulfed Armenians and Turks alike;\r\nthat an already unsustainable civil order was further\r\nworsened by outright rebellion conducted and\r\npromoted by armed Armenian gangs determined to\r\nease the way for invading czarist Russian forces; and\r\nthat Armenians were by no means the only victims of\r\nthat tragic era.\r\nTurkey does not wish to denigrate the suffering of\r\nthe Armenians. Nor do we wish to belittle their feelings\r\nof loss. But in speaking of that era, one should not\r\ngloss over the fact that no less than 2 million Muslims\r\nperished under similar conditions under the same sun.\r\nThis is not a chapter of history with which we can play\r\nthe numbers game. Even one dead person is too many.\r\nTwo is unbearable, whether they be Turkish, Kurdish,\r\nArmenian, Georgian or Circassian. All the peoples of\r\nthe region had to go through enormous suffering.\r\nThousands of Caucasian people were violently\r\nuprooted and had to flee the czarist army. We cannot\r\nand must not pick among the deaths. We must\r\nremember all of them.\r\nThe Turkish Government has made available\r\nthousands of documents relating to Ottoman\r\nArmenians dating back four centuries. The discourses\r\nand deliberations of the Ottoman Council of Ministers\r\nfrom 1914 to 1922 are among those documents. We\r\ninvite Armenian scholars to go through those pages.\r\nLet me say this: to this day, the allegation that there\r\nwas a premeditated, planned and duly executed scheme\r\nto annihilate the Ottoman Armenian population\r\nremains unsubstantiated.\r\nThe Republic of Armenia should have no part in\r\nthis smear campaign propagating only one version of\r\nwhat took place in history. Sensible, impartial,\r\ndispassionate historians know that there are many sides\r\nto historical questions.\r\nTurkey has never blamed the thousands of\r\ninnocent Armenian individuals who perished in that\r\nera. But we blame the so-called nationalist\r\nrevolutionaries, who expected that war would further\r\ntheir aims. The Armenians of today must see the direct\r\nresponsibility of the senseless, militant and radical\r\nArmenian leadership of that day, who began the action.\r\nTo forget what happened to the other is befitting only\r\nto a latter-day chauvinism.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
