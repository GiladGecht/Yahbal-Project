(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: We shall now continue the\r\ngeneral debate.\r\nI give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Lassana\r\nTraore, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Mali.\r\nMr. Traore (Mali) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, I should like to tell you, Sir, how pleased my\r\ndelegation is to see you presiding over the work of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, I should also like to\r\nexpress my sincere and warm congratulations on the\r\ncompetence, devotion and authority with which he\r\nguided the work of the fifty-sixth session.\r\nI should also like to express again to Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the Organization, the\r\nwarm congratulations and profound gratitude of the\r\nGovernment of Mali for the effectiveness and wisdom\r\nhe has shown in managing the concerns of the\r\ninternational community in a particularly difficult\r\ncontext. I take this opportunity to reiterate to the\r\nSecretary-General the thanks of His Excellency Mr.\r\nAmadou Toumani Touré, President of the Republic of\r\nMali, for the confidence that the Secretary-General has\r\nplaced in him in seeking solutions to certain conflicts\r\nthat are shaking Africa. He expresses Mali ‘s readiness\r\nto continue to work for the preservation of international\r\npeace and security, particularly in Africa.\r\nMali wishes to welcome to the Organization\r\nSwitzerland and Timor-Leste, whose admission\r\nstrengthens the universal character of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly is opening in an international context\r\nmarked by the persistence of areas of tension, of\r\ndevelopment inequalities and of growing poverty\r\namong the peoples in developing countries, of the sad\r\nconsequences of globalization, of natural disasters and\r\nof the extremely difficult consequences of the terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September 2001, whose first anniversary\r\nthe international community has just commemorated.\r\nAt the time, Mali vigorously condemned those attacks,\r\nwhich nothing can justify. Since then, it has\r\nparticipated in the great international campaign of the\r\nfight against terrorism. In so doing, it has ratified all\r\ninternational legal instruments related to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. Likewise, important means and\r\nmechanisms have been put in place so that Mali ‘s\r\nnational territory cannot be used for the preparation or\r\nperpetration of terrorist acts.\r\nIn order to meet the terrorist threat, it is important\r\nthat the international community strengthen\r\ncooperation among its members. Furthermore, Mali\r\ncalls for integrated and sustained global action, in\r\nwhich the United Nations should play the premier role.\r\nIt reiterates the appeal of Africa, of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement and of the Organization of the Islamic\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nConference for the holding of an international\r\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations\r\naimed at swiftly concluding a universally accepted\r\nlegal instrument on international terrorism.\r\nIn Mali, the year 2002 was devoted to the\r\nholding, for the third time, of pluralistic, democratic\r\nand peaceful elections, at the outcome of which His\r\nExcellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Touré assumed the\r\ncountry ‘s highest post. Those elections are sufficient\r\nproof that Mali ‘s democratic institutions have taken\r\nroot, and they support the democratic culture of the\r\nMalian people.\r\nHere, I must express, on behalf of the people and\r\nthe Government of Mali, my heartfelt thanks to all our\r\npartners for their contribution to the organization, the\r\nholding and  the success of those elections. Mali is\r\ndeeply attached to the consolidation of the rule of law,\r\nto the preservation of peace and security and to the\r\nimprovement of the living conditions of populations. In\r\nthat regard, our conviction remains that we must\r\ndeepen, promote and respect those values.\r\nFor Mali, republican and democratic institutions\r\nmust be renewed only through democratic institutional\r\nmechanisms that have been established in advance. The\r\nstrengthening of good governance, the consolidation of\r\nthe democratic process, food security, the improvement\r\nof the educational and health systems, the organization\r\nand effective functioning of justice, actions to promote\r\nchildren and women, and the fight against poverty and\r\ncorruption are, inter alia, the challenges to which the\r\nnew Government of Mali is committed to face.\r\nLikewise, as part of its policy of economic and\r\nsocial development, Mali is working, with the help of\r\nits development partners, to implement macroeconomic\r\nreforms designed to re-launch the process of growth\r\nand development.\r\nMali is resolutely determined to guarantee\r\nindividual security in all its dimensions. That why my\r\ncountry is a full-fledged member of the Human\r\nSecurity Network. It fully agrees that there is a need to\r\nharmonize efforts with regard to the destruction of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines and the fight against the illicit\r\ntrade in and the proliferation of small arms and light\r\nweapons, with a view to adopting a United Nations\r\nprogramme of action to reduce the human suffering\r\ncaused by those scourges.\r\nStability, peace and security are prerequisites for\r\nany process of true development in Africa. Despite the\r\nsignificant progress made in resolving certain African\r\nconflicts, our continent continues to be faced with a\r\nnumber of ongoing problems, including debt, the\r\ncontinuing fall in the price of raw materials, the\r\ndemocratic deficit, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria\r\nand difficulties related to humanitarian assistance.\r\nThose issues constitute a serious impediment to\r\ndevelopment efforts in Africa.\r\nMali welcomes the fact that the long fratricidal\r\nconflict in Angola has come to an end and pays a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the people and the leaders of\r\nAngola for the courage that they have shown and the\r\nefforts that they are continuing to make to consolidate\r\npeace and bring about national reconciliation.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to the United Nations for its valuable\r\ncontribution to the search for a resolution of the\r\nAngolan conflict.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to my compatriot,\r\nthe late Alioune Blondin Beye, a talented diplomat who\r\nwas the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for Angola from 1994 until the time\r\nof his death in June 1998. Alioune Blondin Beye made\r\nthe supreme sacrifice on behalf of peace in Angola.\r\nThe recent signing of a peace agreement between\r\nthe main parties to the conflict in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo is a further reason for hope.\r\nThese glimmers of hope for conflict management on\r\nthe continent will require intense support from the\r\ninternational community, which must provide further\r\nsupport for Africa’s efforts through in the form of\r\nresources and mechanisms that are capable of\r\nproviding security and promoting development,\r\nstability and peace.\r\nThe launching of the African Union, which has\r\nreplaced the Organization of African Unity, certainly\r\nrepresents the most decisive historic and political event\r\non the African continent this year. The African Union\r\nwill enable the continent to plan for its future more\r\nclearly, take responsibility for its own development,\r\nprevent and manage conflict and promote partnership\r\nand international cooperation that is better adapted to\r\nthe expectations of the population.\r\nThe recent adoption at Durban of the Protocol\r\nRelating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nCouncil of the African Union, a standing decision-\r\nmaking body for conflict management and resolution in\r\nAfrica, represents an important step forward in the\r\nsetting up of a collective rapid-reaction security system\r\ndesigned to facilitate an appropriate and effective\r\nregional response in dealing with conflict situations\r\nand crises in Africa. It is also the appropriate tool to\r\nbolster the efforts of the Security Council in fulfilling\r\nits main responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, in particularly in\r\nAfrica. Mali has already begun to take the necessary\r\nmeasures to ratify that important instrument.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) also deserves ongoing support from the\r\ninternational community. Indeed, NEPAD offers the\r\ninternational community a historic opportunity to\r\nestablish a credible partnership with Africa — a\r\npartnership founded on shared responsibility.\r\nMali remains deeply concerned about the\r\ndramatic developments of the situation in the Middle\r\nEast. The responsibility of the international community\r\nin dealing with that situation remains a commitment\r\naimed at a global, just and lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast — a peace founded on Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the\r\nprinciple of land for peace.\r\nThe creation of a Palestinian State — the central\r\nissue of the Middle East question — side by side with\r\nIsrael, within safe and internationally recognized\r\nborders, in accordance with Security Council resolution\r\n1397 (2002), would be the best guarantee of a just and\r\nlasting peace in the region.\r\nOn a different subject, Mali accords priority to\r\ninternational cooperation on the basis of international\r\nlaw in the search for a lasting solution to conflicts that\r\nare of concern to the international community. This\r\nprinciple should apply to the handling of the Iraqi\r\nissue.\r\nThe creation of the International Criminal Court,\r\nwhose Statute was adopted in Rome, will not only\r\nmake it possible to bring to justice those who commit\r\nthe most serious crimes that infringe on the dignity of\r\nthe human person, but also will provide an instrument\r\nof deterrence that contributes to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. In this respect, my\r\ncountry would like to reaffirm its full support for the\r\nfight against impunity and for full respect for human\r\ndignity.\r\nMy country would like to appeal to those\r\ncountries that have still not acceded to the Statute of\r\nthe International Criminal Court to do so in order to\r\nstrengthen the legitimacy of that institution.\r\nWe are faced with a number of economic\r\nproblems that are impeding the full growth of several\r\nof our States. The globalization of the economy has\r\ncontributed greatly to a serious imbalance whose chief\r\nvictims are the developing countries. It has led in\r\nparticular to the impoverishment of a large number of\r\npeople, to environmental degradation and to large-scale\r\nmigration.\r\nExternal debt is a heavy burden for poor\r\ncountries. The money used to service the debt has to\r\ncome from the meagre resources of those countries,\r\nwhich seriously handicaps any attempt to re-launch\r\ngrowth and development. Despite the measures agreed\r\nto aimed at alleviating the debt burden for poor\r\ncountries and allowing access to the markets of the\r\ncountries of the North, the inequalities persist and\r\npoverty continues to worsen.\r\nNew measures designed to establish closer links\r\nbetween debt- and poverty-reduction activities should\r\ncontinue. More flexible mechanisms need to be set up,\r\nhowever, in order to mobilize and utilize the resources\r\ngenerated by the application of the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative. In this respect, it is\r\nhighly desirable for the developed countries and the\r\ninternational financial institutions to envisage measures\r\ncapable of enabling the developing countries to move\r\nfurther towards sustainable development and to benefit\r\nfrom globalization. Fulfilling the development\r\nobjectives set forth in the Millennium Declaration\r\nwould bring that about.\r\nMali warmly welcomes United Nations initiatives\r\nin support of the least developed countries, as\r\nexemplified by the Brussels Programme of Action. My\r\ncountry welcomes the holding in March 2002 at\r\nMonterrey of the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and, more recently, the\r\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe conclusions and recommendations that came\r\nout of those two important meetings reflect the\r\ndetermination of the international community to\r\ncommit itself in a resolute manner to achieving the\r\nobjectives contained in the Millennium Declaration.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nThe Government of Mali also encourages\r\ninstitutions and Governments throughout the world to\r\nimplement the relevant provisions contained in the\r\nMadrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, since it\r\nis true that development policies and strategies\r\nintended to reduce poverty must necessarily take\r\naccount of the problems of ageing.\r\nThe democratization and restructuring of the\r\nmain organs of the United Nations desired by the\r\noverwhelming majority of Member States, would\r\ngreatly contribute to peace and security in the world. In\r\nparticular, the democratization of the Security Council,\r\nwhose structure no longer reflects the realities of\r\ntoday’s world, would reflect our common\r\ndetermination to make it a more effective, more\r\nlegitimate and more representative body.\r\nOur peoples are waiting. They are waiting for us\r\nto lead them forward towards rebirth in the new\r\ncentury, towards the building of a new world, rich in\r\ndiversity, more just and more united.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Fathulla Jameel, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Maldives.\r\nMr. Jameel (Maldives): Mr. President, it gives\r\nme great pleasure to join others in congratulating you\r\non your election to the presidency of this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This is not only a recognition of\r\nyour wisdom and ability to successfully guide the work\r\nof this important session, but also a demonstration of\r\nthe high regard the international community has for\r\nyour country, the Czech Republic.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea, for the exemplary\r\nmanner in which he guided the work of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to\r\nextend a very warm welcome to Switzerland on its\r\nadmission to the membership of this Organization. We\r\nare eagerly looking forward to welcoming the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste into our midst\r\nshortly.\r\nEight days ago, the friendly people of the United\r\nStates remembered, with profound sorrow, the death\r\nand destruction inflicted upon them by murderous acts\r\nof terrorism on 11 September 2001. Those brutal and\r\ncowardly acts sent waves of deep shock and anger\r\nthroughout the world. My country was quick to\r\ncondemn the attacks and to express its solidarity with\r\nthe people of the United States. We shared their grief,\r\nand we extended our sympathies to the American\r\npeople. Today, with our modest resources, we stand\r\nwith the international community in the global fight\r\nagainst terrorism and in banishing the scourge of\r\nterrorism from the face of the earth.\r\nMy country believes that the United Nations, the\r\nprimary global organization responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, must\r\nplay the central role in the fight against terrorism. We\r\nwere encouraged by the swift response of the Security\r\nCouncil, taken under Chapter VII of the Charter, after\r\nthe horrifying attacks on the United States last year.\r\nTotal compliance with Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), which details the measures to be taken by\r\nthe international community in combating terrorism, is\r\nof utmost importance. My country also believes that it\r\nis essential to strengthen the existing national, regional\r\nand international legal framework against terrorism if\r\nwe are to effectively fight this war. The proposed\r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\r\nand the international convention for the suppression of\r\nacts of nuclear terrorism need to be finalized as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe unprecedented economic ramifications of the\r\nevents of Nine-Eleven were enormous. Small island\r\ndeveloping States like my own have not recovered\r\nfrom the adverse economic effects of the events yet,\r\nthus demonstrating the vulnerability of our economies.\r\nOur losses were immeasurable. Nonetheless, recent\r\ndevelopments in the area of international economic\r\ncooperation appear encouraging. The Doha agenda and\r\nthe Monterrey consensus offer new hope for achieving\r\nsustainable development. The transformation of those\r\ncommitments into concrete action, and achievement of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals depends on forging\r\na new form of partnership with shared responsibility\r\nbetween the developing countries and the rest of the\r\nworld. We expect the developed countries to fulfil their\r\npart of the understandings, while the developing\r\ncountries endeavour to fulfil their obligations.\r\nMy country, the Maldives, has made considerable\r\neconomic strides in the past. With the continued\r\nassistance of the international community, we have\r\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of official development\r\nassistance (ODA). It is true that two decades of\r\npolitical stability, and sound social and fiscal policies,\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\ncombined with hard work, have improved the standard\r\nof living of our people. We are immensely proud of our\r\nmodest achievements and grateful to those who helped\r\nus. Yet, our narrow economic base poses formidable\r\nchallenges to our desire for continued economic\r\ngrowth.\r\nGlobalization and trade liberalization have added\r\nnew dimensions to our difficulties. The inherent\r\nstructural weaknesses of our economy convince us that\r\nthe preferential access to markets and concessional\r\ncapital we now enjoy as a least developed country have\r\nno alternative form of compensation. Quite simply, we\r\ncannot sustain our development without these special\r\ntreatments.\r\nThese considerations compel us to strongly resist\r\nthe call for the graduation of our country from the list\r\nof least developed countries. We genuinely believe that\r\nthe international community should continue assisting\r\nus in our quest to overcome the structural constraints\r\nimpeding our arrival at a level of sustainable growth\r\nuntil we overcome the inherent vulnerabilities of our\r\neconomy.\r\nThe Committee for Development Policy will\r\npresent its recommendations on the question of\r\ngraduation of the Maldives from the list of least\r\ndeveloped countries to the substantive session of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in the year 2003. We\r\nurge the Committee to complete the necessary\r\ngroundwork, in accordance with all the relevant\r\nEconomic and Social Council and General Assembly\r\nresolutions, before it gives its views on this very\r\nimportant matter.\r\nA fortnight ago, we met in Johannesburg at the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development to take\r\nstock of our achievements since the Earth Summit in\r\nRio 10 years ago. The facts are disappointing and\r\ndiscouraging. What we have achieved over the past 10\r\nyears is far less than what we have not. And, while\r\napathy keeps progress curbed, environmental\r\ndegradation of the world is continuing unabated. If we\r\nare to halt and reverse environmental degradation, we\r\nmust not only pledge urgent action but also take it. As\r\nPresident Abdul Gayoom of the Republic of Maldives\r\nemphasized in his address to the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, for sustainable development\r\nto happen,\r\n“Agenda 21 must be implemented. The Kyoto\r\nProtocol must be universally honoured. The\r\nBarbados Programme of Action must be carried\r\nout. The Millennium Development Goals must be\r\nreached”.\r\nMy country, the survival of which is threatened by\r\nclimate change, therefore remains concerned over\r\ninaction and indifference with regard to the\r\nimplementation of the plans of action for\r\nenvironmental protection and sustainable development.\r\nTurning to another issue, we have been\r\nwitnessing an unprecedented deterioration of the\r\nsituation in Palestine and the Middle East. The Israeli\r\nGovernment has killed the peace process and has\r\ndriven the region to the brink of war. Its acts of\r\naggression and the use of excessive force, coupled with\r\npolitical assassinations, the destruction of vital\r\ninstallations and infrastructure, blockades and\r\neconomic suffocation of the Palestinian people, are all\r\ndesigned to frustrate the prospects for an independent\r\nPalestinian State. We condemn these dastardly actions\r\nand call on the international community to persuade\r\nIsrael to withdraw from all occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories and to respect all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. The Maldives has consistently supported\r\nthe just struggle of the Palestinian people to regain\r\ntheir inalienable rights and to establish an independent\r\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations has an\r\nimportant role to play in bringing the two sides back to\r\nthe negotiating table. We recognize the efforts of the\r\nQuartet, and encourage its members, especially the\r\nUnited States, to remain actively engaged in the search\r\nfor a just, permanent and lasting peace in the region.\r\nDisarmament and arms control measures should\r\nremain a high priority on the international agenda. The\r\ninternational community must unite and act\r\ncollectively to strengthen and enforce the non-\r\nproliferation regimes. The Maldives is party to all\r\nmajor multilateral instruments relating to arms control\r\nand disarmament, including the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We call on\r\nthose countries that are not party to those instruments\r\nto accede to them as soon as possible. Furthermore, my\r\ncountry believes that the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones and zones of peace in various parts\r\nof the world can contribute immensely to the efforts of\r\nthe international community in this regard.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nAs well, we should vigorously pursue our efforts\r\nand enforce verifiable measures to rid the world of\r\nbiological and chemical weapons that can cause mass\r\ndestruction. My country, therefore, believes that\r\nbilateral, regional and multilateral approaches must be\r\nreinforced and that they must complement one another\r\nif we are to free the world of those deadly weapons. We\r\nbelieve also that, on global issues, there should be a\r\nsincere commitment to multilateralism and trust in the\r\nmultilateral institutions. The United Nations must not\r\nonly be placed at the centre of multilateral processes,\r\nbut should remain the principal player responsible for\r\ngrappling with these important global issues, which\r\nhave such a great bearing on international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate the firm\r\ncommitment of the Maldives to the principles and\r\npurposes enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. We firmly believe that the United Nations\r\nrequires reform and restructuring. The aim of the\r\nreform process should be the enhancement of the\r\ncredibility, legitimacy and universal character of the\r\nO1rganization. This involves the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, a new working relationship, and a strong\r\nenforcement regime within the United Nations and\r\namong its Member States.\r\nTogether with other members of the international\r\ncommunity, the Maldives will work to uphold and\r\npromote the objectives of the United Nations. We\r\nremain convinced that the United Nations is the only\r\norganization that is capable of creating a more peaceful\r\nand prosperous world for humanity.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Irakli Menagarishvili, Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nof Georgia.\r\nMr. Menagarishvili (Georgia): Allow me to\r\nbegin by extending my warmest congratulations to\r\nyou –– my colleague Mr. Jan Kavan — on his election\r\nas President of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI cannot but remember the tragedy of 11\r\nSeptember 2001, the anniversary of which we\r\ncommemorated just a few days ago. That bloody act\r\ncommitted here in New York, the host city of the\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters, was directed not only\r\nagainst the United States but also against all the rest of\r\nus, the entire civilized world that the United Nations\r\nsymbolizes. Georgia has been part of the anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition from the very first day. I would like to assure\r\nthe Assembly that Georgia has been doing everything\r\nin its power to be a dedicated partner in this struggle\r\nand that it will maintain the spirit of cooperation until\r\nthe very, successful end.\r\nThe problem of international terrorism is complex\r\nand multidimensional, and I had intended to share our\r\nviews and thoughts on that. However, the recent\r\ncomplications in Georgian-Russian relations have\r\ncompelled me to shift the focus of my address. I am\r\nreferring to the mounting aggressive attacks on my\r\ncountry’s sovereignty emanating from the Russian\r\nauthorities and media. On a daily basis, Georgia is\r\nbeing accused of harbouring terrorists, aiding fighters\r\nand fueling the conflict in Chechnya. This is a clear\r\nattempt to create an enemy image of Georgia in\r\nRussia’s public opinion. Here I have to state clearly:\r\nthis is utter nonsense.\r\nWe believe that the pressure exerted on my\r\ncountry under the pretext of these absurd accusations is\r\nbeing used by Russia as a smokescreen to hide its own\r\nfailure to cope with the conflict in Chechnya. As\r\nPresident Shevardnadze stated in his letter, transmitted\r\nby our Permanent Representative in identical letters\r\naddressed to the Secretary-General and to the President\r\nof the Security Council, “It is hard to imagine a clearer\r\nexample of confusing the cause and the effect”.\r\n(A/57/408, annex)\r\nThe truth is that this tragic chain of events started\r\nwith the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, in which\r\nChechen fighters, citizens of the Russia Federation,\r\nhad been initially recruited, trained and sent to fight.\r\nThen, all of this boomeranged in the Chechen conflict\r\nagainst Russia, when those fighters turned their arms\r\nagainst their own patrons. As a result of two Chechen\r\nwars, Georgia has had to face an influx of thousands of\r\nChechen refugees, and armed gangs of criminals forced\r\ninto Georgia, followed by insistence from the Russian\r\nside on permitting a military operation against them on\r\nGeorgian soil. All this meant a spillover of the endless\r\nand bloody war into Georgia, which we certainly could\r\nnot allow. We are able to take, and are already taking,\r\nall necessary measures to uproot any possibility of the\r\nuse of our territory by terrorists.\r\nAlthough it is evident that the problem of the\r\nPankisi Gorge of Georgia is a side effect of the war in\r\nChechnya, and not vice versa, the violations of airspace\r\nand attacks against the sovereign territory of Georgia\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nby Russian military jets and helicopters have acquired\r\na permanent character. The most recent air strike took\r\nplace on 23 August 2002, causing civilian casualties.\r\nGeorgia has irrefutable documentary and factual\r\nevidence of the attack, which has also been confirmed\r\nby the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope border monitoring operation.\r\nDespite the clear evidence, the Russian military\r\nleadership cynically denies these facts, trying to avoid\r\nan objective investigation in spite of their official\r\nstatements that one will be carried out. Moreover,\r\nunfolding hysteria in Russia on the issue of the Pankisi\r\nGorge has culminated in statements by Russia’s\r\nPresident and its military openly threatening Georgia\r\nwith aggression. These actions not only gravely\r\nendanger peace and security in the region, but also\r\nundermine the efforts of the global anti-terrorist\r\ncoalition to fight against this menace.\r\nWhat is at stake here is not only the sovereignty\r\nand independence of Georgia, but also the very\r\nfundamentals of the current international system. That\r\nis why we have brought this issue to this high forum.\r\nAs I mentioned, Georgian special forces, aided by\r\nour friends, are conducting an operation to restore law\r\nand order in the Pankisi Gorge and the surrounding\r\narea. We already have achieved positive results and are\r\nready to cooperate with all concerned parties, including\r\nRussia. Moreover, we are open to all international\r\ntransparency measures.\r\nWe call on the Russian side to reconsider their\r\napproach and, as President Shevardnadze stressed in\r\nhis letter, we appeal “to the leadership of Russia and\r\nthe President himself to find a common tongue [and] to\r\nrise above the existing problems”. (ibid.) We strongly\r\nbelieve that there is no other way out.\r\nSpeaking about the conflicts in the Caucasus, I\r\nwould like to draw attention to the most painful issue:\r\nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, where our joint\r\nefforts have not yet been successful. I believe that the\r\nmajor mistake made by the international organizations\r\nwas to give the so-called Abkhaz authorities an\r\nopportunity to engage them in endless and absurd\r\ndisputes because of which the bases of the peace\r\nprocess were ignored.\r\nFirst, there is Georgia, a full-fledged member of\r\nthe international community, whose internationally\r\nrecognized territory is being violated by the non-\r\nlegitimate, pseudo-Abkhaz regime based on hostility\r\nand ethnic cleansing. No positive results can be\r\nachieved if the two sides are treated in the same\r\nmanner, if they are viewed as equally responsible and if\r\na policy of pleasing both of them is pursued.\r\nSecondly, there is the fate of the more than\r\n300,000 refugees and internally displaced persons who\r\nhave been ousted from their homeland and deprived of\r\ntheir basic human rights, and whose prospect of return\r\nhas for the past eight years failed to go beyond fruitless\r\ndiscussions. The years of ineffective negotiations merit\r\nonly those conclusions.\r\nI must excuse myself before the authors of the\r\nmost recent Security Council resolution on this matter,\r\nCouncil resolution 1427 (2002), but I cannot agree with\r\nthe softness of their statements. Even though the de\r\nfacto Abkhaz leadership completely ignored and\r\ncategorically refused to receive the document, “Basic\r\nPrinciples for the Distribution of Competences between\r\nTbilisi and Sukhumi”, elaborated by the Group of\r\nFriends of the Secretary-General, the arrogance of the\r\nseparatist regime was responded to in the resolution\r\nonly by a slight reproach.\r\nTo our surprise, the most recent report of the\r\nSecretary-General, based on information from the\r\nUnited Nations Human Rights Office in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia, points to “a modest improvement in the\r\nhuman rights situation”. (S/2002/742, para. 23) It is\r\ndifficult to understand what kind of improvement is\r\nmeant when the separatists insist that Georgian\r\nchildren should study Georgian as a foreign language at\r\nGeorgian schools in Abkhazia, Georgia.\r\nThe tragedy in Abkhazia, Georgia, where\r\nhundreds of thousands, mostly ethnic Georgians, have\r\nbeen forcibly expelled from their homes, has numerous\r\ntimes been rightfully assessed by the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe as ethnic\r\ncleansing. Thus, we can only be astonished that the\r\nUnited Nations is so reluctant to make the same\r\nstatement. This is the more so as the Abkhaz side has\r\nnever complied with any of the 28 Security Council\r\nresolutions adopted since 1993. I hope members would\r\nagree that such inconsistency only strengthens the\r\nseparatists’ self-confidence and increases their belief in\r\ntheir impunity.\r\nIn 1994 we made an unprecedented decision by\r\nasking the United Nations to permit the commencement\r\nof a peacekeeping operation engaging the\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), whereby\r\nthe “collective” peacekeeping forces included only a\r\nRussian military contingent. The reason for this was\r\nthe complete absence of other alternatives at that time.\r\nRegrettably, eight years of this operation have made\r\nclear that the Russian peacekeepers, acting under the\r\nCIS aegis, fail to ensure the security that is so\r\nnecessary for the return of the internally displaced\r\npersons and refugees to their homes in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia. In fact, the peacekeepers have established an\r\nartificial border between the territory controlled by the\r\nseparatists and the rest of Georgia.\r\nOn that basis, we think it is high time to\r\ntransform substantively the ongoing peacekeeping\r\noperation. In particular, we are in favour of introducing\r\na civil police component and creating a joint Georgian-\r\nAbkhaz administration in the Gali district under\r\ninternational auspices. Considering the solid United\r\nNations experience in the establishment and\r\nmanagement of international police forces, we have\r\nhigh expectations of the Assembly’s support.\r\nWe strongly believe that more active involvement\r\nof the international community, and primarily of the\r\nUnited Nations, is indispensable. We understand that\r\nthe United Nations is currently involved in several\r\npeacekeeping operations. Irrespective of that fact, we\r\nhope that some resources can be found to ensure more\r\nactive United Nations engagement in the resolution of\r\nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia.\r\nSpeaking about the ineffectiveness of\r\ninternational efforts in resolving the Abkhaz conflict,\r\nwe should admit that the lack of unanimity within the\r\nGroup of Friends of the Secretary-General remains a\r\nserious impeding factor. That is why it took almost two\r\nyears just to win consensus on the so-called Boden\r\ndocument. Moreover, we are repeatedly faced with\r\nactions by one of the members of the Group that are\r\nutterly inconsistent with the general approach.\r\nAt the end of 2000, the Russian Federation\r\nintroduced a visa regime with Georgia. But contrary to\r\nthe elementary norms of international law, the right to\r\nvisa-free movement has been maintained for the\r\nsecessionist regions of Georgia: the Abkhazia and\r\nTskhinvali regions. Numerous protests by the Georgian\r\nside against this discriminatory decision have been\r\nsimply ignored. Moreover, this was followed by the\r\nmass issue of Russian passports to the local population\r\nof these two separatist regions, and their mass\r\nconversion to Russian citizenship through simplified\r\nprocedures. Here a question arises: how do these\r\nactions, named “legal expansion” even by the Russian\r\nmedia, contribute to a peaceful resolution of these\r\nconflicts?\r\nI have to reaffirm that a peaceful resolution of the\r\nconflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, remains the only\r\nacceptable option for my Government. But as I have\r\nalready mentioned, regrettably, the Abkhaz side has\r\ncategorically refused to consider the document that\r\ndetermines the political status of Abkhazia within the\r\nState of Georgia. Therefore, we have to admit that the\r\nentire peace process in Abkhazia, Georgia, is as much\r\nin jeopardy as it is in need of drastic changes. We call\r\non the United Nations to address this problem.\r\nFinally, United Nations reform has long been a\r\ntopic of discussion. It is unfortunate that work in that\r\nregard has not progressed beyond an exchange of ideas.\r\nToo much time has been devoted to discussions on\r\nSecurity Council enlargement, the increase of the\r\nnumber of its permanent and non-permanent members,\r\nthe change of procedures related to the right of veto\r\nand the adoption of joint decisions. Regrettably, there\r\nhave been no practical results so far.\r\nHere I would like to stress that Georgia reiterates\r\nits full support for the speedy realization of the\r\naforesaid changes. We strongly support granting\r\npermanent membership to Germany and Japan, as well\r\nas the overall enlargement of the Security Council. We\r\nalso insist on increased transparency in the work of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe world community is currently facing\r\nnumerous challenges which require more decisive and\r\nradical steps. And I cherish the hope that this forum\r\nwill be courageous enough to make them without delay.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency the Honourable Arjon Jung Bahaur Singh,\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs of Nepal.\r\nMr. Singh (Nepal): Let me begin by taking this\r\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nunanimous election to preside over the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly. My delegation\r\npledges its full support to you and has full confidence\r\nin your ability to steer the session to a successful\r\nconclusion. I would also like to express my\r\ndelegation’s profound appreciation to your predecessor,\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the excellent\r\nmanner in which he guided the fifty-sixth session.\r\nOur tributes are also due to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ntireless efforts to carry out the mandate of the United\r\nNations.\r\nNepal congratulates Switzerland and welcomes it\r\nas a new Member of the United Nations. We also look\r\nforward to having the privilege of welcoming East\r\nTimor as a new Member in a few days.\r\nWe are meeting here under the long and dark\r\nshadow of the terrorist attacks carried out against our\r\nhost city on 11 September 2001. The trauma and\r\ntragedy the attacks wrought are still fresh in our\r\nmemory. Our heart goes out to the children who lost\r\ntheir parents and to the families who lost their near and\r\ndear ones.\r\nItself a victim of terrorism, Nepal understands the\r\npain and peril terrorists brutally perpetrate on\r\nindividuals and societies. As globalization and\r\ntechnological advances have made it possible for\r\nterrorists to move people and funds across the world\r\nwith ease, the concerted efforts of nations will be\r\nessential to stamp out terrorism. We therefore support\r\nthe ongoing global war on terrorism and see the need\r\nfor better enforcement of existing international law and\r\nfor the conclusion of a comprehensive global\r\nconvention for that purpose. In Nepal we have enacted\r\na new law in this regard, as well as rules and\r\nregulations that include provisions of relevant\r\ninternational treaties to which we are a party.\r\nBeing opposed to democracy and freedoms, the\r\nso-called Maoist terrorists in Nepal have been taking\r\ninnocent lives, abducting children to work as child\r\nsoldiers, and destroying private homes, schools and\r\nvital infrastructure. In view of this, His Majesty’s\r\nGovernment has recognized them as terrorists and has\r\nlaunched a campaign to protect people and property.\r\nWe appreciate the moral and financial support from our\r\nfriends in this effort. We also deplore any suggestion\r\nthat tends to equate the Government’s obligation to\r\nprotect its citizens with the terrorists’ dastardly acts of\r\nviolence.\r\nEven though terrorism is the menace of the\r\nmoment, other peace and security problems continue to\r\ntrouble the world. The Middle East is burning and\r\nAfrica is boiling over with conflict. Tension also\r\nabounds elsewhere — in Asia, Europe and Latin\r\nAmerica.\r\nTo find comprehensive peace in the Middle East,\r\nNepal supports the time-bound implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) and of the\r\nQuartet agreement of April 2002.\r\nIraq must comply with the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, and the international community\r\nmust respect the sanctity and integrity of the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations in order to avoid setting fire to the\r\nwider region.\r\nWe are happy that Afghanistan is limping back to\r\nnormalcy. Providing security coverage over the entire\r\ncountry should be the United Nations priority so that\r\nreconstruction can pick up momentum.\r\nEast Timor has emerged as a free South Pacific\r\nnation. We congratulate its people on their freedom and\r\nindependence, and the United Nations on helping them\r\nthrough the transition.\r\nIt is encouraging that Sierra Leone has achieved a\r\nmeasure of stability. In order to achieve a wider peace,\r\nattempts must be redoubled to resolve the conflicts in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and\r\nBurundi.\r\nThe Balkans, Cyprus and the Korean peninsula\r\nshould receive necessary support in their quest for\r\npeace and harmony.\r\nNo durable peace will be possible without the\r\nprevention of conflicts and the resolution of disputes\r\nthrough peaceful means. Peacekeeping, disarmament\r\nand confidence-building are the pillars of the edifice of\r\nculture of peace. United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations have proved very useful in helping to\r\nstabilize fragile situations during and after conflicts.\r\nNepal is a major player in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping and has contributed more than 40,000\r\nmilitary and police personnel so far. Our peacekeepers\r\nhave served the United Nations with outstanding\r\ncompetence and dedication, sustaining 42 casualties in\r\nthe line of duty. Our commitment to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations remains robust. Supplying\r\nfully self-sustained troops is our goal, but that often\r\nbecomes difficult for a poor country. Until we achieve\r\nour goal, the United Nations must continue to bridge\r\nthe resource gap through innovative means.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nIn our view, the total elimination of nuclear\r\nweapons in a time-bound manner constitutes the\r\ncornerstone of the disarmament endeavour. We also\r\nstress the imperative of observing existing international\r\ntreaties, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty and concluding a fissile material cut-off treaty.\r\nNuclear-weapon-free zones and a guarantee not to use,\r\nor threaten to use, nuclear weapons against non-\r\nnuclear-weapon States, and other confidence-building\r\nmeasures will help the process of nuclear disarmament.\r\nEqually important is the need to eradicate chemical,\r\nbiological and other weapons of mass destruction.\r\nSmall arms have taken more lives than any other\r\ntype of weapons. We welcome the agreement that\r\nemerged from the United Nations Conference on the\r\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\r\nIts Aspects last year. Nonetheless, we underline the\r\nneed for stricter controls on the possession of such\r\narms by non-State actors.\r\nUnited Nations Regional Centres for peace and\r\ndisarmament are an important tool for building\r\nconfidence and helping the process of disarmament in\r\ntheir respective regions. We are grateful to Member\r\nStates for having designated Nepal as host of the\r\nRegional Centre in Asia and the Pacific. It is, however,\r\ndeeply troubling that the Centre is yet to move to\r\nKathmandu, despite our full commitment to meeting all\r\nthose obligations that other hosts have met. We urge\r\nthe United Nations to relocate the Centre immediately\r\nand not to set terms and conditions over and above\r\nthose that other hosts of similar Centres have accepted.\r\nOne may argue that not all conflicts are products\r\nof poverty. Yet people living in poverty, deprivation\r\nand despair easily become susceptible to the evil\r\ndesigns of extremist elements. Hence, poverty\r\nreduction and sustainable development are an\r\ninseparable part of efforts to prevent conflicts and\r\nterrorism and to promote peace.\r\nIndeed, developing countries must bear the\r\nprimary responsibility for their own development.\r\nNepal has undertaken far-reaching reforms to liberalize\r\nthe economy, optimize internal resources, attract\r\nforeign investment and protect the environment. Most\r\nof its public expenditure is invested in people and in\r\npoor areas. Measures have been taken to provide clean\r\nGovernment and improve overall governance.\r\nHowever, our problems are so big and our\r\nresources so limited that without additional resources\r\nand market access we cannot accelerate our growth and\r\nsustain our development. Wealthy nations will\r\ntherefore have to fulfil their commitments made at the\r\nMillennium Summit, as well as at the Doha, Monterrey\r\nand Johannesburg conferences. We appreciate the\r\npledges of the European Union and the United States to\r\nraise the level of their development assistance and urge\r\nthem to keep their word.\r\nDeveloping countries also need a conducive\r\nglobal economic climate to grow. For that to happen,\r\nrich nations must strive to lift the world economy out\r\nof the current recession and agree on major reforms in\r\nthe international financial architecture.\r\nMore than others, least developed countries in\r\nAfrica and elsewhere need increased assistance and\r\nsupport to break loose from their poverty trap.\r\nDeveloped nations should do everything in their power\r\nto meet the official development targets, provide duty-\r\nfree and quota-free access for the products of the least\r\ndeveloped countries to their markets and help\r\nimplement other provisions of the Brussels Programme\r\nof Action.\r\nLandlocked developing countries suffer the\r\nconstraints of remoteness, high-cost economies and\r\nhigh transit costs. They need targeted assistance to\r\novercome their specific hurdles, as do the small and\r\npoor island developing States. Nepal appreciates the\r\nUnited Nations for its important role in propelling\r\ndevelopment in developing countries. We also welcome\r\nthe timely appointment of the High Representative for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries, Landlocked\r\nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing\r\nStates.\r\nRegional cooperation is a linchpin of attempts\r\ncollectively to foster competitiveness, capacity and\r\nsynergy. In South Asia, we are striving to build such\r\ncooperation under the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC). Poverty alleviation,\r\ntrade liberalization and technical cooperation have\r\nreceived the principal focus as precursors to the\r\nultimate establishment of a South Asian economic\r\nunion. The eleventh SAARC summit, which Nepal\r\nhosted in January, is a testament to member States’\r\neagerness not to let their political differences affect the\r\nprocess of regional economic integration.\r\nNepal is fully committed to democracy, justice\r\nand human rights, including those of women and\r\nchildren. We are strengthening the values and\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\ninstitutions of democracy and incorporating\r\ninternational human rights standards into our domestic\r\nlaws. Our National Human Rights Commission is fully\r\nfunctional and the judiciary is being revitalized.\r\nSadly enough, there are nearly 20 million\r\nrefugees around the world and many more internally\r\ndisplaced persons. In Nepal alone, there are over\r\n100,000 refugees from Bhutan, deprived of their\r\nhuman rights at home. With a view to finding a durable\r\nsolution to the problem, Nepal has engaged in bilateral\r\nnegotiations with Bhutan for nearly a decade now. We\r\ncall on Bhutan to take the negotiations as a matter of\r\nurgency and to pave the way for the earliest\r\nrepatriation of the refugees.\r\nFriendly countries, the United Nations system —\r\nparticularly the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the World Food\r\nProgramme — and non-governmental organizations\r\nhave been generously assisting us in the maintenance\r\nof the refugees. We express our appreciation to them\r\nfor their help and urge them to continue it until the\r\nrefugees return home.\r\nCommitted to the principles and purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations, Nepal underlines the need for United\r\nNations reform, so that the Organization can meet the\r\nchallenges before it. Therefore, revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council is our\r\npriority. We favour reinforcing collaboration and\r\ncomplementarity between the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and the Security Council in their respective\r\nand related areas.\r\nIn our view, it is imperative to carry out a limited\r\nexpansion of the Security Council membership in both\r\ncategories, in a way that preserves the Council’s\r\nflexibility and ensures equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation. Reform of its working methods must\r\nalso continue, with a view to enhancing transparency\r\nand improving the quality of consultations, particularly\r\nwith troop-contributing countries.\r\nReform is equally essential within the Secretariat\r\nin order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nInter-agency coordination should also be upgraded.\r\nCentral to strengthening the United Nations are a\r\nvigorous Non-aligned Movement and a robust Group of\r\n77. As a member of both, Nepal pledges to work with\r\nother countries to reinvigorate those bodies and to\r\nexpand cooperation between them and the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I must remind all the speakers once again\r\nthat we had agreed at the beginning of the General\r\nAssembly to a time limit of 15 minutes. I strongly\r\nappeal to all members to reduce their prepared\r\nspeeches to correspond to the agreed time limit.\r\nI give the floor to Mr. Ali Abdi Farah, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of\r\nDjibouti.\r\nMr. Farah (Djibouti) (spoke in French): In a year\r\nof frightful tragedy and uncertainty, we were at least\r\nfortunate to have the charisma and leadership of Mr.\r\nHan Seung-soo, as President of the fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly. We also take this opportunity,\r\nMr. President, to warmly congratulate you. We\r\nwelcome the admission of the Swiss Confederation to\r\nthe United Nations family, and we are pleased at the\r\nfuture status of East Timor.\r\nUnder the enlightened leadership of Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, the United Nations has rediscovered its\r\nrelevance and its credibility. The reform measures he\r\nhas implemented in recent years have enabled better\r\ncoordination, better information-sharing, strengthened\r\ncohesion and a stronger strategic direction. Today the\r\nUnited Nations is working more and more closely with\r\ncivil society to fight disease, address the challenges of\r\npoverty and respond to humanitarian crises. The\r\nOrganization has also built a meaningful partnership\r\nwith private sector enterprises, aimed at having\r\ndeveloping countries benefit from their expertise and\r\nresources.\r\nIn that regard, the Monterrey International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Social Development, held in\r\nJohannesburg, have highlighted the unprecedented\r\ncollaboration of various decision-makers, such as the\r\nUnited Nations, Governments, the private sector,\r\ninternational financial institutions and civil society.\r\nLast week, during numerous commemorative\r\nceremonies marking the horrible events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001, it was obvious that the world had\r\nbeen left traumatized. The reverberations of 11\r\nSeptember are still palpable throughout the United\r\nNations system and the world. Indeed, within less than\r\n24 hours, the Security Council took decisive action,\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\ndeclaring that the 11 September attacks posed a threat\r\nto international peace and security. The important\r\nresolution on the fight against terrorism, Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), established a general\r\nprocedure for verifying that every country is\r\nimplementing the relevant provisions of the resolution,\r\nin order to eradicate that scourge.\r\nOur resolve and determination to fight the threat\r\nof terrorism has undoubtedly been strengthened. The\r\nevent itself alerted us to understanding and perceiving\r\ncertain basic truths: human vulnerability and\r\ninterdependence, the mobilization of a real\r\ninternational coalition in a short time, if need be, and\r\nour common resolve to eradicate the criminals who\r\ntake innocent life, regardless of nationality, religion,\r\nsex and colour.\r\nPresiding over the official ceremonies marking\r\nthe anniversary at the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nthe Secretary-General, said that:\r\n“Everything that we work for — peace,\r\ndevelopment, health, freedom — is damaged by\r\nthis horror. Everything that we believe in —\r\nrespect for human life, justice, tolerance,\r\npluralism and democracy — is threatened by it. It\r\nmust be defeated — and it must be defeated by a\r\nworld acting as one.” (SG/SM/8376, para. 7)\r\nTherefore, combating terrorism requires more\r\naggressive law enforcement measures everywhere.\r\nIn order to eradicate that horror, almost all\r\ncountries have initiated an extraordinary series of\r\nactions, which have converged towards a complete\r\nreorientation of their policies, and particularly their\r\nforeign policies.\r\nWe have witnessed countries pursuing policies to\r\nreach out to others, to strengthen ties, to share global\r\nvisions and to forge new strategic alliances. There is no\r\ndoubt that the events of 11 September 2001 have led to\r\nthe forming of new alliances and the strengthening of\r\nexisting ones. However, it should not be a surprise that\r\nthis has also generated stricter controls on the\r\nmovements of people, particularly people of certain\r\nreligions, backgrounds, complexions and regions.\r\nThere is no doubt that we are living in a dangerous\r\nworld in which vigilance is called for. However, while\r\ntaking all that into account, let us be careful not to\r\ndebase our grief for the victims and their families. As\r\nan editorial in a well respected newspaper stated:\r\n“What happened a year ago was terrible, but\r\nour shock and our respect for the suffering of\r\nthose left behind should not cloud our judgement\r\nabout unrelated issues”. (The Independent,\r\n11 September 2002)\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s words of 11 September\r\n2002, on the first anniversary of that unspeakable\r\ntragedy:\r\n“Today, we come together as a world community\r\nbecause we were attacked as a world community.\r\n“...\r\n“May the memory of those who perished on 11\r\nSeptember serve to inspire a better, more just,\r\nmore peaceful world for all of us”. (Press release\r\nSG/SM/8376)\r\nWe hope that reason will prevail over fear, prejudice\r\nand hatred.\r\nWe welcome President Bush’s commitment to\r\nexplore fully the route of the Security Council in\r\nfinding a way to draw Iraq towards a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the outstanding issues. We also welcome\r\nIraq’s unconditional agreement to the return of the\r\nUnited Nations inspectors. That demonstrates its\r\nreadiness and full cooperation in the implementation of\r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. It is, indeed,\r\nan encouraging development. We must dedicate\r\nourselves to seeking a political solution within the\r\nframework of the United Nations. And the United\r\nNations must act, and act very quickly, to put an end to\r\nthe acute crisis which threatens to engulf an entire\r\nregion and which could have an impact on the whole\r\nworld. We all know the consequences of this crisis. Let\r\nus join together and work with determination to save\r\nthe region, which is already in turmoil, from further\r\nconflict.\r\nOne of the gravest yet often overlooked threats to\r\nworld peace is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The\r\nRepublic of Djibouti agrees with the Secretary-General\r\nthat the route to peace in the Middle East was laid out\r\ndecades ago in Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967), 338 (1973), and, recently, in resolution 1397\r\n(2002), which stipulated the conditions of land for\r\npeace, an end to terror and to occupation and two\r\nStates, Palestine and Israel, living side by side within\r\nsecure and recognized borders. Unfortunately, the\r\nfocus has been shifted again by demands for a\r\nleadership change in the Palestinian Authority and for\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\npolitical and security reforms, while simultaneously\r\neasing Israel’s obligation to return to the negotiating\r\ntable. The so-called sequential approach has always\r\nfailed. It is urgent to move forward on all the issues,\r\ncomprehensively and simultaneously.\r\nTo the political impasse should be added the\r\neconomic destruction that has resulted from the\r\ninsurmountable checkpoints, roadblocks, repeated\r\nincursions and the demolition of buildings and supply\r\nnetworks. The Palestinian people are in danger; a\r\nwhole nation is virtually living in a prison. There is a\r\ngrowing, unprecedented humanitarian crisis, as stressed\r\nby a number of recent reports, describing in detail the\r\nlevels of malnutrition, the drop-off in child\r\nimmunization programmes, the increased risk of\r\ncommunicable diseases and runaway, endemic poverty.\r\nWe remain steadfast in our condemnation of the\r\nviolence and the killing of innocent civilians, whether\r\nthey be Palestinians or Israelis. In this context, we\r\nwelcome the latest plan of the Quartet, which outlines a\r\nthree-phase road map to a comprehensive final\r\nsettlement within a three-year period ending in 2005.\r\nTo complete the process of bringing peace to the\r\nMiddle East, Syria and Israel must reach an agreement\r\non Israel’s withdrawal to the borders of 1967.\r\nA decade ago, the United Nations Conference on\r\nClimate and Development, held at Rio in 1992, gave us\r\nAgenda 21, which contains pertinent recommendations\r\nfor lessening our wasteful consumer habits, protecting\r\nthe atmosphere and the oceans, promoting sustainable\r\nagriculture and combating poverty. The subsequent\r\nthematic conferences further strengthened and\r\nbroadened those recommendations, which have led to\r\nthe promises set out in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nparticularly on alleviating endemic and severe poverty.\r\nThe goals, targets, commitments and deadlines for\r\nreducing poverty provide a new, decisive impetus. The\r\nrecent World Summit on Sustainable Development,\r\nheld in Johannesburg, made important and significant\r\nprogress on crucial issues facing humankind today.\r\nAll those demonstrations of goodwill, however,\r\nneed to be backed by concrete action. Speaking on\r\nbehalf of the European Union during this General\r\nAssembly debate, the Prime Minister of Denmark\r\nexpressed that sentiment:\r\n“At Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg, we\r\nreached consensus on what needs to be done. But\r\nknowing what has to be done is not enough. As\r\nworld leaders, we must see that it is done”.\r\n(A/57/PV.2)\r\nIn an increasingly demanding world, more and\r\nmore references are made to good governance,\r\ninvestment in human capital and economic freedom as\r\nconditions for developing countries to qualify for\r\ndevelopment assistance. For its part, Africa has\r\nacknowledged to its partners the need to enhance the\r\ncontinent’s responsibility in all areas of concern,\r\nincluding peace, stability, democracy, human rights and\r\ndevelopment. Through the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development, Africa has shown that it is able\r\nto shoulder greater collective responsibility in\r\nresolving its conflicts and in its development. In return,\r\nAfrica keenly hopes that the financial constraints that\r\nhave seriously hindered development and human\r\ndignity will be duly taken into account by our partners.\r\nThe issue of HIV/AIDS is one of the major\r\nconcerns of our continent. More than 30 million people\r\nare infected in the world, and 75 per cent of those are\r\nAfricans. The impact on development is disastrous.\r\nLife expectancy has decreased in some countries.\r\nRemarks made by the Executive Director of the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS are very\r\nclear:\r\n“If people are not alive, if people are not\r\nhealthy — the people who are supposed to bring\r\nus sustainable development — then it won’t\r\nhappen. AIDS is a major crisis of human\r\nresources.”\r\nBased on the outcome of the peace and\r\nreconciliation conference held at Arta, Djibouti, our\r\nsubregional organization, the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), is working to\r\norganize a conference to bring together the national\r\ntransition Government and other parties in Somalia —\r\nthe regional administrations, factions and groups that\r\nopted to stay away from that historic meeting. The\r\nfront-line States, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, were\r\nmandated by the Ninth IGAD Summit of Heads of\r\nState and Government, held in January, to bring all of\r\nthe components together with a view to completing the\r\nArta process and thus paving the way for the\r\nemergence of a broad-based Government. Much has\r\nbeen accomplished, but it is fair to state that an\r\nenormous amount remains to be done.\r\nThe Republic of Djibouti believes that a realistic\r\nroad map, consistent with current thinking is a capital\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nnecessity. The majority view of the international\r\ncommunity — including the United Nations, the\r\nAfrican Union, the League of Arab States, the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, IGAD and the\r\nEuropean Union — is that the Arta peace process\r\nremains the most viable basis for peace and national\r\nreconciliation in Somalia. There has been a willingness\r\nto complete, without preconditions, the Arta peace and\r\nreconciliation process. Without ambiguity, the\r\ninternational community has consistently called for\r\ndialogue involving the national transition Government\r\nand the other parties, in a spirit of mutual respect and\r\ntolerance, with a view to establishing an inclusive\r\nGovernment in Somalia based on power sharing\r\nthrough a democratic process. Those are cardinal\r\nprinciples that should keep us on the right path. We\r\ncannot permit ourselves to stray from them.\r\nDecisions related to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security lie with the Security\r\nCouncil, which, despite the exponential increase of\r\nUnited Nations membership over the past three\r\ndecades, has singularly remained an unrepresentative\r\nbody. If confidence is to be placed in its decisions,\r\nthere must also be an expansion in both the permanent\r\nand the non-permanent member categories, giving both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries the opportunity to\r\nbecome permanent members. The Working Group\r\ncharged with studying that issue has thus far failed to\r\narrive at a satisfactory conclusion, and we see no clear\r\nprospect of the impasse being broken soon. More\r\nobjectivity and clarity of vision are required in order to\r\nbring about that vital necessity.\r\nOver the past decades, the people of the Horn of\r\nAfrica have had their share of difficulties and\r\nsuffering, and we are anxious to see peace,\r\ndevelopment and a reduction in conflict. For its part,\r\nmy country, the Republic of Djibouti, is firmly\r\nconvinced of the merit of good-neighbourly relations,\r\ncooperation and the creation of opportunities for the\r\nbenefit of our peoples. We are resolutely committed to\r\nwork hand in hand with our international partners in\r\ngeneral, and with our friends in the region in particular,\r\nto resolve all outstanding issues that compromise trust\r\nand harmony.\r\nThe President: Once again, I appeal to Members\r\nto keep to the agreed time limit and to pay attention to\r\nthe light on the speaker’s table.\r\nThe General Assembly will now hear an address\r\nby His Excellency Mr. Youssouf Ouédraogo, Minister\r\nof State, Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation of\r\nBurkina Faso.\r\nMr. Ouédraogo (Burkina Faso) (spoke in\r\nFrench): As is the case every year, Burkina Faso is\r\nvery pleased to take part in the regular session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, this great meeting of peoples united\r\nby the same destiny and motivated by the same ideal:\r\nto build a world of justice, love and peace. I am\r\nconvinced, Mr. President, that the choice of a person of\r\nyour great ability to preside over this fifty-seventh\r\nsession will help us greatly. As we congratulate you\r\nand the members of the Bureau on that special honour,\r\nmy delegation and I want to assure you of our full\r\navailability and cooperation for the success of your\r\nmission. We also want to express again our profound\r\nrecognition of your predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\nfor the competence with which he presided over the\r\nfifty-sixth session.\r\nThe quest for peace and security and the\r\npromotion of cooperation and development are the\r\nessential values that presided over the creation of the\r\nUnited Nations. Today, more than ever before, with the\r\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 — whose first\r\nanniversary we have just commemorated — those\r\nobjectives have assumed a more immediate and urgent\r\ncharacter, because world peace finds itself seriously\r\nthreatened, in particular by international terrorism. We\r\nmust all convince ourselves that the best response to\r\ninternational terrorism must proceed from collective\r\naction — in other words, from action by the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nAs a member of that community, Burkina Faso —\r\nwhich has made the quest for peace a creed —\r\nreaffirms most solemnly, vigorously and\r\nunambiguously its condemnation of terrorism in all its\r\nforms, whatever the motivations. Our determination to\r\nfight alongside the United Nations against that danger\r\nis unwavering, and our implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) was the subject of a\r\nreport submitted to the Committee established pursuant\r\nto that resolution.\r\nIf the fight against terrorism henceforth occupies\r\nthe spotlight, that must not obscure the imperative\r\nnecessity of finding just and lasting solutions to\r\ninternational crises, particularly regional conflicts that\r\nso often feed and maintain that scourge. In this\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nconnection, Burkina Faso welcomes the laudable\r\ninitiatives of the United Nations to restore peace to\r\nmany regions of the world, particularly Africa, where\r\nUnited Nations interventions — coupled with the\r\ninitiatives of the Organization of African Unity, which\r\nhas become the African Union, and those of the\r\nAfrican subregional organizations — have made it\r\npossible to pacify many areas of tension and conflict\r\nthat were ravaging parts of our continent.\r\nWe also welcome the gradual return to peace in\r\nSierra Leone, in Angola, in the Great Lakes region,\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea and in Sudan, even if in\r\nthe latter case we must regret the suspension of the\r\nagreement between the Government of that country and\r\nthe armed rebellion.\r\nIn Western Africa, the hopes that arose at the end\r\nof the war in Sierra Leone unfortunately seem\r\nunfulfilled with the resumption of combat in\r\nneighbouring Liberia.\r\nWe cannot remain passive in the face of civil war\r\nin that sister country. Supported by others of goodwill\r\nand working within the framework of the process of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States, Burkina\r\nFaso convened a meeting in Ouagadougou from 8 to 11\r\nJuly between a number of Liberian political parties,\r\ncivil society organizations, associations and\r\nmovements with a view to renewing the inter-Liberian\r\ndialogue. By agreeing to host that important meeting,\r\nmy country, Burkina Faso, hoped to provide a further\r\nchance for dialogue, which the Liberians themselves\r\ndesired. The initiative was supportive of efforts that\r\nhad already been agreed upon in the context of the\r\nRabat process and the Mano River Union.\r\nThis year has been particularly bloody in the\r\nMiddle East. We cannot forget the excesses committed\r\nin Jenin and the harassment of President Arafat at\r\nRamallah. The atrocities perpetrated every day against\r\nthe unarmed Palestinian civilian population are a great\r\ncause for concern. Dialogue and negotiation must\r\nprevail over confrontation and violence. Burkina Faso\r\nreaffirms its support for the creation of an independent\r\nPalestinian State, existing side by side with Israel, and\r\nwe strongly urge the Security Council to ensure that its\r\nrelevant resolutions are implemented.\r\nWith regard to Iraq, Burkina Faso welcomes the\r\nfact that reason has prevailed. We remain convinced\r\nthat unilateral preventive action that is not authorized\r\nby the Security Council would have dire consequences\r\nfor world peace. In that connection, we would like to\r\npay tribute to the courageous decision of the Iraqi\r\nGovernment, which has just agreed to the return to\r\nBaghdad of United Nations weapons inspectors. We\r\nearnestly hope that that approach will ultimately lead to\r\na definitive resolution of the crisis, especially since the\r\nsanctions imposed on that country are unjust and have\r\nmade martyrs of the Iraqi people.\r\nBurkina Faso has always made it clear that, apart\r\nfrom their unjust character, sanctions cannot properly\r\nresolve substantive problems but are\r\ncounterproductive. We therefore request the lifting of\r\nall sanctions against Iraq, Cuba and Iran, as well as\r\nthose imposed on Libya in connection with the\r\nLockerbie question.\r\nWith regard to that latter question, Burkina Faso\r\nbelieves that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has fully\r\ndischarged its obligations to the Security Council and\r\nthat the sanctions imposed on it should now be lifted.\r\nAs a result of the demands of globalization,\r\nprotecting the right to development has become the\r\nmost important obligation for our countries. We\r\ntherefore place great hope in the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), to which the\r\nAssembly has just devoted a special debate. We should\r\nrecall that that new initiative shows how determined\r\nAfrican leaders are to work tirelessly to rid the\r\ncontinent of poverty and marginalization.\r\nDuring a recent forum that took place in\r\nOuagadougou on the role of the private sector in the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, President Blaise Compaore\r\nstressed two major responsibilities that are incumbent\r\nupon the international community. The first relates to\r\nthe enhancement and structural reform of official\r\ndevelopment assistance so as to adapt it to the needs of\r\nits beneficiaries and to improve its effect on their\r\nstandard of living. The second relates to the problem of\r\nthe access of African goods to the markets of the\r\nindustrialized countries and the need to put an end to\r\nanti-competitive subsidies that run counter to the rules\r\nof the World Trade Organization.\r\nMore generally, the various meetings on\r\ndevelopment that have taken place this year, in\r\nparticular the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development, held at Monterrey, and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held at\r\nJohannesburg, as well as the commitments set out in\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, open up new and\r\nencouraging prospects for developing countries.\r\nIt remains true, however, that the best form of\r\ndevelopment is that which takes into account the\r\nrequirements of democracy and human rights. In this\r\nconnection, I would like to assure the Assembly that\r\nmy country will be resolute in ensuring that democracy\r\nbecomes rooted in our political and institutional life,\r\nand we are taking significant and concrete actions to\r\nthat end. The people of Burkina Faso have thus just\r\nrenewed, for a third consecutive time and for a further\r\nfive years, the mandate of the National Assembly. That\r\nelection, in which all the political parties took part,\r\ntook place in a calm, transparent and fair manner and\r\nhas seated members of 13 political parties to legislate\r\non questions of interest to the people of Burkina Faso.\r\nThe Government has also created a Ministry for\r\nthe Promotion of Human Rights to ensure respect for\r\nand the implementation of human rights in all their\r\naspects. That is why my Government welcomes the\r\nelection of Burkina Faso to the United Nations\r\nCommission on Human Rights, which will enable us to\r\nmake a positive and active contribution to the work and\r\nthe deliberations of that international body, which\r\nmonitors the implementation of human rights\r\nthroughout the world. Furthermore, our Government is\r\ndetermined to greatly enhance the status of women and\r\nchildren in line with the recommendations of the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children.\r\nIt is thus clear that the credibility and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations is increasing on a\r\ndaily basis, whether with regard to the promotion of\r\npeace and security, to economic cooperation or to\r\nactivities in the social and humanitarian sphere.\r\nThe recent admission of Switzerland to the\r\nUnited Nations and the forthcoming admission of\r\nTimor-Leste further confirm the irreplaceable role of\r\nthe United Nations as an means of ensuring\r\ninternational stability. It is precisely because of that\r\nuniversality that Burkina Faso is able to call upon the\r\ninternational community to consider the return of the\r\nRepublic of China to this world Organization. Taiwan\r\nhas clearly shown that it is a free, independent,\r\ndemocratic nation that enjoys all the attributes of a\r\nState under international law and that would thus be\r\nable to make a truly useful contribution to the building\r\nof a better future for humankind. The credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations is at stake in this respect.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like, on behalf of my\r\ncountry, to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his\r\nassured leadership of this Organization, as well as to\r\nthe staff of the United Nations for their tireless\r\ncontribution to the quest for peace.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Abdulaziz Kamilov, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Uzbekistan.\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan) (spoke in Russian): At\r\nthe outset, allow me to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on\r\nhis election as President for the current session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I would also like to express\r\nappreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo for his excellent\r\norganization of the work of the previous session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nA year ago the world confronted acts of terror,\r\nunprecedented in scale and barbarity. We all remember\r\nthe 11 September 2001 events in the United States and\r\nmourn the lives lost.\r\nThe events of last autumn, first of all, show that\r\nsecurity threats are taking on new and dangerous\r\nforms. The phenomenon of terrorism has become more\r\ncomplex. At the current stage the world has to contend\r\nwith organized international terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations devotes much attention to the\r\nfight against international terrorism. We welcome the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), which stipulates the establishment of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to coordinate and\r\nincrease the efficiency of the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts to fight this most dangerous threat\r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nI would like to recall in this regard that\r\nUzbekistan strongly urged establishment of such a\r\ncommittee within the United Nations as early as 1999.\r\nUzbekistan is one of the few countries that are\r\nparties to all twelve conventions on combating\r\nterrorism. We sincerely hope that the appeal by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan to the United Nations\r\nMember States to join and ratify these documents will\r\nbe followed and put into practice.\r\nUzbekistan supports the international counter-\r\nterrorism coalition as a matter of principle and stands\r\nready to make its contribution to enhance global and\r\nregional stability.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nThe events of 11 September made the world face\r\nup to the situation in Afghanistan and, one can say,\r\nopened the eyes of the international community to the\r\nfact that terrorism has no borders and only through\r\njoint efforts we can defeat this perilous challenge to\r\nhumanity. In a strict and, I would say, categorical way\r\nthe events of 11 September reminded everybody that\r\ntwenty years of war turned Afghanistan into a breeding\r\nground and hotbed of international terrorism that\r\nthreatened not only neighbouring countries and nations,\r\nbut all of humanity.\r\nWe are gratified today by the positive\r\ndevelopments in that country; we welcome the\r\nconvening of the Loya Jirga, and the transitional\r\nGovernment led by President Hâmid Karzai.\r\nAt the same time, despite the successful\r\ncompletion of the military phase of the counter-\r\nterrorist operation in Afghanistan, today there can be\r\nno room for complacency.\r\nFirst, huge amounts of weapons accumulated\r\nduring the long years of war in Afghanistan still remain\r\nin the possession of armed groups there. In this context\r\nthere can be no justification for the attempts of certain\r\nStates to supply ever more weapons to this long-\r\nsuffering land.\r\nTo ensure stability and prevent military\r\nconfrontation it is important to resolve the problems\r\nrelated to the reduction and collection of the huge\r\namounts of weapons accumulated in Afghanistan.\r\nClearing the Afghan territory of weapons arsenals\r\nbelonging to criminal groups will also reinforce the\r\nactivities of the United Nations and regional\r\ninstitutions to thwart the illicit arms trade.\r\nSecondly, the post-war dislocation, economic\r\ndisaster, as well as the lack of resources to rebuild\r\nAfghanistan, may become a catalyst for social unrest\r\nthat could be used by certain armed groups inside and\r\nbeyond Afghanistan to create a new round of military\r\nconfrontation.\r\nThirdly, there are still various groups in the\r\nterritory of Afghanistan, including remnants of the\r\nTaliban, that are capable of conducting subversive\r\nactions and guerrilla warfare. Confrontation continues\r\namong various warlord-leaders of different ethnic\r\ngroups.\r\nFourthly, the situation on drug trafficking remains\r\nalmost unchanged. Afghanistan is still the world’s main\r\nsupplier of opium and heroin. According to many\r\ninternational experts, the removal of the Taliban regime\r\ndoes not yet mean the elimination of the criminal\r\nnarcotics business in Afghanistan. Today the whole\r\nworld is seriously concerned about this problem. There\r\nis an urgent need for adequate measures and assistance\r\non the part of the entire international community, as\r\nwell as the active support of the Afghan authorities to\r\ncombat narco-aggression.\r\nThe number of drug addicts in the world runs into\r\nthe hundreds of millions of people. Proliferation of\r\ndrug addiction undermines both the health of living\r\ngenerations and the gene pool of nations. This affects\r\npeople in both the developed and developing countries.\r\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan, making great efforts to\r\nfight drug production, abuse and trafficking, fully\r\nsupports the measures undertaken by the United\r\nNations and the international community to confront\r\nthese threats.\r\nI would like to underline that it is much easier\r\nand more effective to fight drug trafficking at the\r\nsource. Therefore, we have to block the huge flow of\r\nthe Afghan drugs right at the borders of the Central\r\nAsian States, rather than hunt for grammes and\r\nkilogrammes in Europe and other developed countries.\r\nIn this regard, it is advisable to shift from\r\nnumerous counter-narcotics programmes of small\r\nefficiency to the concrete solution of this acute\r\nproblem by allocating the United Nations-controlled\r\nresources and means to nip the narcotics trafficking at\r\nthe source.\r\nToday the attention of the entire international\r\ncommunity is riveted on the issue of Iraq. In this regard\r\nwe support the statement of United States President\r\nGeorge Bush delivered in the United Nations from this\r\nvery rostrum.\r\nThe measures towards resolution of the current\r\nsituation proposed by the President of the United States\r\ndeserve thorough consideration and may be taken as a\r\nbasis for the elaboration of the position to be taken by\r\nthe United Nations Security Council.\r\nUzbekistan attaches great significance to the\r\nstrengthening of the global process of non-proliferation\r\nof weapons of mass destruction. Our country has\r\nalready received credit for its activity in this field. The\r\nstrategy of Uzbekistan in ensuring security is based on\r\nthe country’s participation in the United Nations-led\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nprocesses of disarmament and arms control and\r\nreduction.\r\nUzbekistan fully supports the principle of\r\nindivisibility of security and in this context, as an\r\ninitiator of the nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central\r\nAsia, acknowledges responsibility for strengthening the\r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and takes active part\r\nin the elaboration process of international instruments\r\nin this field.\r\nUzbekistan proposes to sign the practically\r\nfinalized and agreed draft of the document on the\r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia in\r\nKazakhstan in the city of Semipalatinsk, the former site\r\nfor hundreds of nuclear tests, in the presence of United\r\nNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan during his\r\nupcoming visit to the Central Asian region.\r\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan supports proposals\r\nmade by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the United\r\nNations reforms. This is necessary for an appropriate\r\nadaptation of this Organisation to the dynamic changes\r\nin the international arena. Uzbekistan is one of those\r\nStates that considers the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil reforms to be part of the evolution of the entire\r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nThe current structure of the Security Council\r\nreflects the realities of a past era. The world has\r\nchanged since then. We believe that Japan and\r\nGermany have a legitimate right to permanent\r\nmembership in the Security Council. All necessary\r\ngrounds for this are present.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall that it has\r\nbeen ten years since Uzbekistan became a United\r\nNations Member, and it is very gratifying to see the\r\nUnited Nations family expanding. We congratulate\r\nSwitzerland and the Democratic Republic of Timor-\r\nLeste on their decision to become fully-fledged parties\r\nto the multilateral cooperation and dialogue of the\r\nUnited Nations. It should mean that the idea of peace\r\nand noble principles of the global security system are\r\nthe order of the day.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Regional Cooperation of Rwanda,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. André Bumaya.\r\nMr. Bumaya (Rwanda) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme at the outset, on behalf of my delegation and on my\r\nown behalf to congratulate you wholeheartedly on your\r\nelection as President of this session of the General\r\nAssembly. As testimony to the esteem enjoyed by you\r\nand your country, Sir, you may rest assured of the\r\nsupport of the Rwanda delegation in carrying out your\r\ntasks.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay a\r\nwell-deserved tribute to your predecessor for the\r\neffective way in which he guided our work during the\r\nfifty-sixth session.\r\nI should also like, on behalf of my Government,\r\nto express my gratitude and appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless\r\nefforts to ensure the effective and transparent\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations and to promote\r\nworld peace.\r\nThe Government of Rwanda warmly welcomes\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and the Swiss\r\nConfederation to the United Nations. We are already\r\nfamiliar with their contribution to the enhancement of\r\nthe role of our great United Nations family, especially\r\ntheir respect for the principles of equal rights and the\r\nright of peoples to self-determination.\r\nIn this connection, the Government of Rwanda\r\nappeals for appropriate measures to be taken to ensure\r\na fair and lasting settlement of the conflict in Western\r\nSahara, in accordance with the purposes and principles\r\nof the Organization. Furthermore, the Government of\r\nRwanda reiterates its hope that peace will be achieved\r\nin the Middle East — a peace that guarantees the\r\ncreation of a secure Palestinian State with recognized\r\nboundaries, coexisting peacefully with the State of\r\nIsrael, whose security should also be guaranteed.\r\nI should like to recall that, with the collapse of\r\nthe Berlin Wall and the end of the ideological war often\r\nreferred to as the cold war, the world entered a new era,\r\nwith a new economic order. Despite the existence of\r\nhotbeds of violence in a number of areas on all\r\ncontinents, we welcome and encourage initiatives\r\ndesigned to resolve the tensions created during the cold\r\nwar. In that connection, the Rwandan Government\r\nencourages talks between North and South Korea. We\r\nhope that the two parties will move forward towards\r\nthe peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula. The\r\nRwandan Government also supports the principle of\r\none China. The question of Taiwan is an internal matter\r\nfor China and can be effectively resolved out of the\r\ncontext of the ideological war that gave rise to it, in\r\naccordance with the principle, already accepted by the\r\nChinese themselves, of one country and two systems.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is being\r\nheld one year after the terrible events of 11 September\r\n2001. The terrorist attack perpetrated against the\r\nUnited States remains deeply etched in the memory of\r\nthe people of Rwanda, and I would like to reiterate our\r\nsolidarity with the American people. I do so with good\r\nreason: perhaps I should recall that, since 1994,\r\nRwanda has been living under the perpetual threat of\r\nterrorist groups based in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, the most active of which is known as the\r\nArmy for the Liberation of Rwanda (ALIR), an\r\norganization made up of elements of the former\r\nRwandan Army (ex-FAR) forces and Interahamwe\r\nmilitias that were responsible for the 1994 genocide.\r\nThe leaders of ALIR were among those who planned\r\nand carried out the genocide in Rwanda. Since 1994\r\nsuch elements have attacked Rwanda on many\r\noccasions, carrying out the targeted killing of innocent\r\npeople and destroying social and economic\r\ninfrastructure of national and international\r\nsignificance. It was such elements that savagely\r\nmassacred American, British and New Zealand tourists\r\nin the Bwindi park in March 1999.\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nNow, in an attempt to mislead international public\r\nopinion and escape justice, the members of this\r\nterrorist group are endeavouring to organize themselves\r\ninto political groups using a number of different labels.\r\nThe Government of Rwanda therefore appeals to the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States to take the\r\nnecessary measures to track down and arrest all those\r\nresponsible for the Rwanda genocide who are now\r\nmembers of ALIR and to bring them to international\r\njustice. We also appeal to the United Nations and its\r\nMember States to formally condemn those countries\r\nthat finance, harbour or lend moral, material or\r\nlogistical support to the ALIR terrorist organization.\r\nWith regard to the prosecution of those accused\r\nof the Rwandan genocide, I reiterate the appeal of the\r\nRwandan Government to the international community\r\nto ensure the effectiveness and credibility of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda so that it\r\ncan truly fulfil the expectations of the people of\r\nRwanda and all justice-loving people. In this\r\nconnection, special attention should be paid to the\r\nrecommendations on this subject submitted by my\r\nGovernment to the Security Council. Furthermore, the\r\ntime has come for the international community to\r\nensure the implementation of the relevant\r\nrecommendations of the report on the Rwanda\r\ngenocide that was drafted under United Nations\r\nauspices, known as the Carlsson report.\r\nWith regard to the destabilizing effects of the\r\nterrorist activities of ALIR, I should like to advocate as\r\na remedy that support be given to the Lusaka and\r\nPretoria Agreements, which are designed to restore\r\npeace in the Great Lakes region. Those two\r\nAgreements provide for the disarmament,\r\ndemobilization, reintegration and repatriation of what\r\nare known as the negative forces that are operating in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which include\r\nex-FAR forces and Interahamwe. The Rwandan\r\nGovernment appeals as a matter of urgency to the\r\nUnited Nations and its Member States to spare no\r\neffort in strongly supporting the implementation of\r\nthose Agreements.\r\nAs for Rwanda, it has done its utmost to\r\nimplement those Agreements and to work to\r\nre-establish a genuine and lasting peace in the Great\r\nLakes region. In accordance with the statement made\r\nby Paul Kagame, President of the Rwandese Republic,\r\non 13 September during a meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil on the question of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nannounce that, on 17 September, my Government\r\nbegan to withdraw its troops from the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, in conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the Pretoria Accord.\r\nMy Government is convinced that the\r\nimplementation of those Agreements will lead us not\r\nonly to the restoration of security and stability in our\r\nsubregion, but also to the establishment of a climate of\r\nconfidence and good cooperative relations that will\r\nfacilitate common actions in our struggle against the\r\nterrorist activities orchestrated by ALIR or by any\r\nother terrorist organization.\r\nIn this connection, I would like reaffirm the\r\ncommitment of the Government of Rwanda to\r\ncooperate fully to achieve the success of any initiative\r\ndesigned to prevent and repress terrorism in all its\r\nforms. In this connection, and in implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), our\r\nGovernment has now ratified all the various\r\ninternational instruments to combat terrorism that we\r\nhad not signed or ratified previously, in addition to the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Convention on\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nthe Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, which we\r\nhad already ratified. Rwanda has just submitted its first\r\nreport to the Security Council Committee established to\r\nfollow up the implementation of that resolution.\r\nRwanda is resolutely determined to combat terrorism,\r\nsource of desolation and instability for the international\r\ncommunity. We believe that the international\r\ncommunity should mobilize all of its means to fight\r\nand to put an end to poverty, which affects so much of\r\nour population. It should do more for the eradication of\r\ninjustice and inequality in order to ensure a better\r\nworld for future generations. Thus, we call for the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the entire\r\nUnited Nations system to ensure the implementation of\r\nall of the international commitments to help poor\r\ncountries. Commitments, such as those expressed in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, in the Monterrey Consensus\r\nand at the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, should be reflected in concrete actions\r\nwithout delay. Third-world countries, especially\r\ncountries of Africa, set great store by this.\r\nIn Africa, we would like to root out the causes of\r\npoverty. We have already grasped the different aspects\r\nof the situation and decided upon a framework to guide\r\nus in this long struggle against poverty, namely the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD).\r\nWithin NEPAD, we have pledged to put an end to\r\nfratricidal wars that devastate our already moribund\r\neconomies. We have pledged also to work towards\r\ndemocracy, good governance, and for letting the rule of\r\nlaw prevail.\r\nThe international community is hereby called\r\nupon to assist us in this process. We ask each of the\r\nrich countries to reexamine its positions regarding the\r\nterms that are often linked to various interventions\r\naimed at helping poor countries, particularly as regards\r\nthe debt and official development assistance (ODA).\r\nThis needs to be done in order to enable these countries\r\nto confront effectively the various scourges that\r\nthreaten them, including famine, pandemic diseases,\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, and so forth, so that they can\r\neventually catch up with the rich countries. Hence,\r\nglobalization will become profitable for the whole of\r\nmankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Central African\r\nRepublic, Mr. Agba Otikpo Mezode.\r\nMr. Mezode (Central African Republic) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly is being held one year after the terrible\r\nterrorist attack of 11 September 2001. The delegation\r\nof the Central African Republic still intimately feels\r\nthe strong emotion caused by that attack against liberty\r\nand democracy.\r\nThe President of the Republic, the head of State,\r\nHis Excellency Ange-Félix Patassé, leading the\r\ndelegation of the Central African Republic to the\r\ncommemoration, wanted to reiterate his friendly\r\nsympathy towards the American Government and\r\npeople, and to reassert the firm determination of his\r\ncountry to do everything that is necessary in order to\r\ncontribute effectively to the legitimate international\r\ncrusade against all forms of terrorism. Our work is\r\nstarting within a particular context in the history of\r\ninternational relations, because never has humanity\r\nbeen so conscious of the need to confirm its cohesion\r\nin order to ensure a world of concord, solidarity and\r\npeace.\r\nBefore expanding on those facts, Mr. President, I\r\nwould like to express to Mr. Jan Kavan and the\r\nmembers of the Bureau our warm congratulations on\r\nhis election to the presidency of this session. His rich\r\nexperience, as a great statesman and diplomat, will\r\nensure the success of our work. That work will benefit\r\nfrom the full cooperation of the delegation of the\r\nCentral African Republic. I take this opportunity also\r\nto express our admiration for his eminent predecessor,\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo, for the skill and competence with\r\nwhich he carried out his responsibilities.\r\nThe determination with which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, is\r\nworking, under all circumstances, to make the\r\nprinciples and ideals of the United Nations prevail,\r\nonce more elicits our admiration. The President of the\r\nRepublic, the people and the Government of the\r\nCentral African Republic, want hereby to assure you of\r\ntheir support and reiterate their deep gratitude for all\r\nthe objective reports on the situation in the Central\r\nAfrican Republic.\r\nMoreover, the entry of the Swiss Confederation to\r\nthe United Nations, and soon the entry of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, are evidence of\r\nthe resolute march of our Organization towards\r\nuniversality. The Central African Republic wishes to\r\nwelcome Switzerland and hopes to cooperate closely\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nwith that country within the framework of the United\r\nNations.\r\nTwo years ago, 189 Member States met in this\r\nvery hall. They set objectives for development for the\r\nMillennium, such as the reduction of extreme poverty,\r\neducation for all, promotion of gender equality and the\r\nempowerment of women, reduction of child mortality,\r\nimprovement of maternal health, fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS and other diseases, such as malaria and\r\ntuberculosis, preservation of a sustainable environment\r\nand the establishment of a world partnership for\r\ndevelopment. All States unanimously pledged, through\r\nmultilateral cooperation, to implement what is called\r\nthe Millennium Declaration in order to achieve those\r\nobjectives within 15 years.\r\nThe findings we made at the Millennium Summit\r\non the state of the world at that time showed serious\r\nshortcomings with regard to our will to fulfil\r\ncollectively the ideals bequeathed to us by the founding\r\nfathers of our Organization. However, through that\r\nsame will, we undertook, in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, to re-examine these issues so as to set a\r\ncourse for the world that corresponds to the aspirations\r\nand expectations of the people.\r\nHowever, this is far from what has happened. The\r\nrevolution in information and communications, the\r\nprogress of science and technology, the liberalization\r\nof trade and the disappearance of State frontiers, while\r\naccentuating the phenomenon of globalization, have at\r\nthe same time led the world into an uncertain and\r\nunforeseeable future, to the point where the world\r\ntoday is threatened in the short term with imbalance.\r\nStates should fully explore all the potential\r\noffered by multilateral cooperation within the\r\nframework of the United Nations, particularly to put a\r\nstop to such threats. These threats, according to our\r\ndelegation, are essentially of four kinds.\r\nThe first of these, as you can expect, is the threat\r\nthat changed the world in one hour. It is called\r\nterrorism. This diffuse form of organized trans-border\r\ncrime that foils armies, however powerful they may be,\r\ncannot be tolerated. The reaction of the international\r\ncommunity to this new form of aggression must be\r\nsustained by adhering to resolutions firmly condemning\r\nsuch actions, and by observing a certain attitude\r\ntowards the countries and institutions that tolerate their\r\nauthors. Thus, all together, through solidarity and\r\nmultilateral cooperation, we shall conquer terrorism,\r\nwhether committed by a State or a small group.\r\nThe destruction of the environment, which\r\nthreatens our future, is also a real threat. We should\r\nstrive for the sustainable preservation of forests, fauna\r\nand biodiversity for the benefit of present and future\r\ngenerations. This subject was eloquently analysed at\r\nthe Summit on Sustainable Development, held recently\r\nin Johannesburg. My delegation has no doubt that\r\ninternational solidarity can here too be of help to\r\nsafeguard nature. We should like on this occasion to\r\nexpress our gratitude for the American initiative,\r\nsupported by the international community, for the\r\nprotection of the Congo basin, of which the Central\r\nAfrican Republic is a member.\r\nThere is one threat, which does not need to be\r\nnamed because it is so obvious, and that is poverty,\r\nwhich — far from declining — has grown over the\r\nyears. The Declaration talks about reducing poverty,\r\nbut must we not first stop manufacturing it? Famine,\r\nendemic disease, HIV/AIDS and malaria are the daily\r\nlot of the two thirds of humankind living on barely $1 a\r\nday. How can we fail to be moved by this? That fringe\r\nof humanity calls merely for the solidarity that will\r\nallow it to live in conditions worthy of our civilization.\r\nIn the face of the drying up of official\r\ndevelopment assistance, and with respect to the failure\r\nof certain development initiatives, the African\r\ncountries have felt that we need to develop some sort\r\nof partnership with the countries of the North. They\r\nhave therefore proposed an original plan for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa through the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development. The delegation of the Central\r\nAfrican Republic fervently calls for the worldwide\r\nsupport of the international community for the\r\nimplementation of the plan.\r\nThe many challenges defined at the Millennium\r\nSummit in terms of goals to be attained, along with the\r\nnew plan for African development, will have no chance\r\nof success unless they are fostered in an environment\r\nof peace, security and stability. However, current\r\nconditions do not give much cause for optimism,\r\nalthough we note the occasional positive movement\r\ntowards the settlement of a few conflicts. Regional\r\ncrises remain, however, that are no less threatening to\r\npeace.\r\nFaithful to its doctrine, the Central African\r\nRepublic believes that the situation in the Middle East\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\ncan be settled only through the strict implementation of\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the United Nations on this\r\nsubject. It deplores the escalation of violence in that\r\nregion.\r\nIn the context of its own regional and subregional\r\nsphere, the Central African Republic highly appreciates\r\nthe latest developments in the situation in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in particular the\r\nsigning of the Pretoria peace agreement with Rwanda\r\nand the disengagement agreement signed with Uganda.\r\nIn conclusion, I am compelled to note that my\r\ncountry, the Central African Republic, is the victim of\r\ninternational ostracism and of indifference that borders\r\non contempt. How else is one to understand the silence\r\nof the international community and the international\r\nfinancial institutions in the face of calls for\r\nintervention and of Security Council resolutions\r\nfollowing on the reports of the Secretary-General since\r\nthe notorious date of 20 May 2000, and despite the\r\nappeals of the Organization of African Unity — now\r\nthe African Union — the Community of Sahel-Saharan\r\nStates and the Central African Economic and Monetary\r\nCommunity? And yet, our country has come a very\r\nlong way with respect to good governance — that\r\nfetishistic word! — in politics, economics and finance.\r\nAs of early 2002, the reduction of corruption is no\r\nlonger a figment of the imagination, as evinced by the\r\naction undertaken in our financial offices.\r\nMy country’s situation requires me to call\r\nattention to the words of the Algerian writer Kateb\r\nYassin:\r\n“Our blood must become enflamed and we must\r\ncatch fire in order to move the spectators. May\r\nthe world open its eyes not to our mortal remains,\r\nbut to the wounds of the survivors.”\r\nThe sustainable development we all dream of will\r\nbecome a reality only if, here and now, we inject\r\nsolidarity into international relations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia, His Excellency Mr. Fawzi Bin Abdul Majeed\r\nShobokshi.\r\nMr. Shobokshi (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nI have the honour to deliver the statement of the\r\nGovernment of Saudi Arabia on behalf of His Royal\r\nHighness the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure at the outset of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly to\r\nconvey to Mr. Kavan personally and to his friendly\r\ncountry, the Czech Republic, our sincerest\r\ncongratulations on his election to the important\r\nposition of President of the Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that he will preside with great skill and\r\nefficiency over our deliberations.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our\r\ngratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who\r\npresided over the last session with wisdom and\r\nexperience and deserves our gratitude and appreciation.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to express our\r\nthanks and appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan for his tireless efforts to achieve peace and\r\nconsolidate security throughout the world and for his\r\npersistent efforts to strengthen the Organization’s role\r\nand enhance its efficiency.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that the\r\nrecent admission of Switzerland to membership of this\r\nOrganization will enrich the United Nations and\r\nundoubtedly enhance its role, given that country’s\r\nremarkable contributions to and experience in\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nOur current session coincides with the first\r\nanniversary of the horrendous disaster that befell the\r\nUnited States of America as a result of a most\r\ndespicable act of terrorism that led to the death of\r\nthousands of innocent lives, with enormous material\r\nlosses and immeasurable harm from which we are all\r\nstill suffering. The pain and suffering of the American\r\npeople over the loss of their relatives and loved ones as\r\na result of this cowardly act was our loss, too, as we\r\nwitnessed those events in a state of total shock and\r\ndismay. We felt nothing but absolute condemnation for\r\nthose who committed that utterly criminal and barbaric\r\nact.\r\nI therefore convey our sincerest condolences and\r\nheartfelt sympathies to the President of the United\r\nStates, to the families of the victims and to the\r\nAmerican people. I assure them that this horrible\r\nexperience can only strengthen what we already know\r\nabout the inner strength and pride of the American\r\npeople. Those feelings of fortitude and resolve, as well\r\nas their determination to confront this challenge and to\r\nmove on with resolve, guided by the principles and\r\nvalues of the founding fathers of their great nation,\r\nwere unmistakable when we, along with the American\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\npeople and President, commemorated the first\r\nanniversary of the tragedy.\r\nIt was most overwhelmingly painful for us to see\r\na number of our young people, who were in a position\r\nto contribute beneficially to the development and well-\r\nbeing of their own country, fall victim to those who led\r\nthem astray as they embarked on a road that ended\r\ntragically. Those young men committed a grave offense\r\nagainst their country and their religion, which totally\r\nand utterly forbids the crime they committed.\r\nMay I be permitted here to quote from the letter\r\nsent to United States President George W. Bush by His\r\nRoyal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah, in describing\r\nthose young men in a most unambiguous and\r\nmeaningful manner:\r\n“We in Saudi Arabia felt especially acute pain at\r\nthe realization that a number of young Saudi\r\ncitizens had been enticed and deluded and their\r\nreasoning subverted to the degree of denying the\r\ntolerance that their religion embraced and turning\r\ntheir backs on their homeland, which has always\r\nstood for understanding and moderation. They\r\nallowed themselves to be used as a tool to do\r\ngreat damage to Islam, a religion they espoused,\r\nand to all Muslims.\r\n“I would like to make it very clear that real\r\nMuslims throughout the world will never allow a\r\nminority of defiant extremists to speak in the\r\nname of Islam and distort its spirit of tolerance.\r\n“Your friends in the Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia denounced and condemned the attacks of\r\n11 September as strongly as the American people\r\ndid. Like them, we are convinced that nothing can\r\never justify the shedding of innocent blood or the\r\ntaking of lives and the terrorizing of people,\r\nregardless of cause or motive. Therefore, we do\r\nnot simply reiterate our sincere condolences to\r\nthe victims’ relatives; we also assure all of our\r\ncontinued will and determination to do all we can\r\nto combat that malignant evil and uproot it from\r\nour world. My country will maintain its firm\r\nresolve to combat terrorism unilaterally and\r\njointly with the international coalition. We shall\r\npursue the war against terrorism relentlessly. Our\r\ndrive emanates from our firm conviction that\r\nterrorism is a pernicious disease that poses a\r\nlethal threat to every human society and every\r\neffort must be made to confront and defeat it.”\r\nSaudi Arabia’s position regarding terrorism has\r\nalways been very clear, dispassionate and responsible.\r\nThat is logical since our country was honoured by God\r\nto be the custodian of the Muslims’ holiest sites, and it\r\nis also the birthplace of the heavenly message of Islam.\r\nThus, we want to uphold the principles and teachings\r\nof the Islamic faith.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its total\r\nsupport for all Security Council resolutions related to\r\nthe question of terrorism. It has been cooperating fully\r\nwith the international community in implementing\r\nthose resolutions, with the aim of combating terrorism.\r\nMoreover, Saudi Arabia has taken the necessary steps\r\nto close any gaps in regulations related to charitable\r\nfundraising that might be exploited for illegal\r\npurposes.\r\nThe competent authorities in Saudi Arabia have\r\nput in place all the necessary measures to implement\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Moreover, the\r\nGovernment of Saudi Arabia has lent its support to\r\nevery international effort, within the framework of the\r\nSecurity Council, to crack down on terrorism by all\r\nmeans approved by the international community.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has itself\r\nsuffered from terrorist acts, has enacted regulations that\r\nmete out punishment to the perpetrators of terrorist\r\nacts. Moreover, it has made the fight against terrorism\r\npart of its basic school curricula.\r\nAt the regional level, Saudi Arabia was one of the\r\nfirst countries to sign the Pan-Arab Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorism, adopted by the League of\r\nArab States in 1998, and it is also a signatory to the\r\nConvention of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference on Combating International Terrorism.\r\nAt the international level, Saudi Arabia is a party\r\nto 10 conventions and agreements that deal with\r\nvarious forms of terrorism. We sincerely look to the\r\nUnited Nations, which represents all countries of the\r\nworld, to make the international effort to combat\r\nterrorism a truly global one, without bias or\r\ndiscrimination, with the primary goal of serving all\r\nmembers of the international community and protecting\r\nthem from the evils of terrorism, including State-\r\nsupported terrorism.\r\nConfronting terrorism, international cooperation\r\nin tracking down terrorist organizations and the\r\nexploration of all ways and means to eradicate it\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nrepresent important steps towards eliminating that\r\ndangerous phenomenon. However, the international\r\neffort against terrorism, regardless of its effectiveness,\r\nwill not be capable of totally eradicating that\r\nphenomenon unless it addresses its underlying causes,\r\nincluding political, economic and social circumstances\r\nthat become ground for extremism, violence and\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe decision to eradicate terrorism has been\r\ntaken, without hesitation or vacillation. However, if our\r\ntrue objective is to eradicate the possibility of its\r\nrecurrence, then attention must be paid to the political,\r\neconomic and social conditions that, in many instances,\r\ncreate grounds for extremism, especially when those\r\nconditions reach serious proportions and the possibility\r\nfor peaceful change and development does not exist.\r\nFor example, the deteriorating conditions of\r\noppressed people, whether they suffer injustice and\r\noppression or are subject to foreign occupation, and the\r\ninternational community’s inability, for one reason or\r\nanother, to find just solutions to those problems will\r\nultimately lead to a situation in which opportunity is\r\ncreated for people with evil intentions to take\r\nadvantage of naïve young men who are led to believe\r\nthat violence and terrorism are the only and ideal\r\nmeans for correcting the injustice that afflict them.\r\nThirty-five years have passed since the\r\nPalestinian people came under the suffocating Israeli\r\noccupation. The cycle of violence in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories will never end unless the\r\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinians are respected.\r\nThose rights have been acknowledged by the\r\ninternational community as a whole and are enshrined\r\nin many United Nations resolutions and have become\r\nlegally binding through various international\r\nagreements signed by consecutive Israeli Governments\r\nwith the Palestinian side.\r\nThe obligations contained in those agreements\r\nhave been completely ignored by the Israelis, whether\r\nthey relate to the continuation of the occupation or the\r\ntreatment of the Palestinian people and their legitimate\r\nleadership.\r\nThe policy of siege, starvation, military\r\nincursions, the destruction of property and the\r\ndesecration of holy places totally contravenes not only\r\nsigned agreements, but also international law and\r\nhumanitarian norms.\r\nFurthermore, the Government of Ariel Sharon is\r\nmarginalizing the Palestinian Authority, established\r\nunder the Oslo Accords, isolating the Palestinian\r\nterritories and destroying their infrastructure. In\r\naddition, with nothing left to destroy, recently Sharon\r\nhas implemented a policy not only of imprisoning, but\r\nalso of assassinating, members of the Palestinian\r\nleadership. He recently and blatantly declared that\r\nIsrael is no longer bound by any agreement signed with\r\nthe Palestinians, including the Oslo Accords.\r\nThe situation in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories will undoubtedly lead to a humanitarian\r\ndisaster resulting from the economic siege, the\r\nunchecked spread of disease and the virtual collapse of\r\npublic health and security forces.\r\nThe most important fact to be recalled by all,\r\nparticularly the Israeli people, is that the goal of\r\nsecurity promised by the current Israeli Government\r\nwill never materialize. That is due directly to the\r\npolicies and practices of that Government, which chose\r\nto ignore dialogue and negotiations and opted for\r\noppression and violence as a means of resolving the\r\nPalestinian problem.\r\nPresident Bush’s statement to the Assembly\r\nconcerning the difficulty of attaining peace between the\r\nPalestinians and Israelis, without providing the\r\nfreedom necessary for both, conforms with the current\r\nsituation in the occupied territories, which continue to\r\nface a cycle of violence and suffering because one side,\r\nnamely the Palestinians, has been denied its right to\r\nfreedom and independence.\r\nTherefore, the exit point of that dilemma is\r\nIsrael’s acknowledgement of the importance of the\r\nexistence of a Palestinian State established on a basis\r\nof constitutional legality and capable of conducting\r\nnegotiations and resolving pending problems that\r\ncannot be ignored or bypassed. That is the action that\r\nmust be taken if we truly intend to put an end to the\r\ncrisis in the occupied territories, the price of which is\r\nbeing paid by both Palestinians and Israelis.\r\nWe believe that an independent Palestinian State,\r\nbased on a constitution binding on all Palestinians, and\r\nspecifying the basis and rules governing their relations\r\nwith Israel, will ultimately constitute a guarantee not\r\nonly for the Palestinians, but also for the Israelis\r\nthemselves, because the Israeli side will have the\r\nassurance of dealing with a legitimate entity with clear\r\ncharacteristics, structures and institutions. Their future\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nrelations will determine their responsibilities. To\r\nachieve this goal, the international community must\r\nmove to end the humanitarian catastrophe and suffering\r\nfaced by the Palestinian people.\r\nThere is also a dire need to halt the violence\r\nraging in the area through a practical and dispassionate\r\ntreatment of the security situation. That clearly means\r\nthat the international community must hold the Israeli\r\nGovernment accountable to the same level of security\r\nobligations that is required of the Palestinian Authority.\r\nTo limit the security obligations to the Palestinian side\r\nalone is neither practical nor a means of solving the\r\nproblem. It is incumbent on all of us to work together\r\nto alleviate the suffering of the Palestinians and to take\r\nthe necessary practical steps to put the Palestinian\r\nproblem on the path to the desired settlement.\r\nAs far as the comprehensive settlement of the\r\nArab-Israeli conflict is concerned, we see in the Arab\r\npeace initiative adopted at the Beirut Arab Summit a\r\nhistoric move that contains all the requirements for a\r\njust and permanent peace in the Middle East based on\r\nresolutions of international legitimacy and supported\r\nby all Arab States. It would lead to Israel’s full\r\nwithdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and to\r\nnormalization of Arab relations with Israel.\r\nThere is another problem that has reached crisis\r\nproportions and has become a source of grave danger\r\nto the security and stability of the Middle East: the\r\nissue of Iraq and its implementation of the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. President Bush\r\nmentioned in his speech before the General Assembly\r\nthe need to refer this matter to the Security Council in\r\norder to have the appropriate resolutions adopted. That\r\nrepresents a new and positive approach that we view\r\nwith satisfaction. Without a doubt, that step has led to a\r\nnew climate, resulting in the decision of the Iraqi\r\nGovernment to allow the unconditional return of\r\nUnited Nations weapons inspectors. That development,\r\nwhich will avert confrontation through diplomatic\r\nmeans, shows that a positive step will, in most cases,\r\nlead to a reciprocal positive step. At this point, it is\r\nappropriate to express our satisfaction with the Iraqi\r\nGovernment’s prompt response to the call of the\r\nministerial committee of the League of Arab States,\r\nwhich met in parallel with the General Assembly. We\r\nbelieve that it is now the Security Council’s\r\nresponsibility to undertake serious efforts to alleviate\r\nthe suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq. We also\r\nbelieve that it is now the responsibility of Iraq to\r\npromptly carry out its pledges to allow the return of the\r\nUnited Nations weapon inspection teams without prior\r\nconditions.\r\nThe world has suffered great destruction and\r\nhuman misery during the last century, which was\r\ncharacterized by bloody confrontations, hate, conflicts\r\nand violence. In a world of intertwined dependencies\r\nand common interests, the peace and stability of\r\nhumankind depend largely upon the international\r\ncommunity’s determination to forsake wars, renounce\r\nviolence, combat terrorism and settle disputes by\r\npeaceful means and through the promotion of a culture\r\nof peace and dialogue, as well as by consolidating\r\ninternational cooperation, tolerance and understanding.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls for the\r\nestablishment of an international humanitarian order\r\nbased on a new form of partnership between the\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, on a solid basis of\r\ncooperation, solidarity and international economic\r\nrelations built on justice, equality, mutual benefits and\r\njoint responsibilities.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia looks forward to a\r\ntwenty-first century governed by the rule of law and\r\nnot by brutal force, a century of true pluralism in which\r\neveryone will participate in managing the affairs of the\r\npresent and in creating the future, instead of excluding\r\nand ignoring others. We look forward to a year in\r\nwhich the moral values that govern human behaviour\r\nwill prevail and in which the banners of justice, mercy\r\nand interaction among peoples will be raised in order\r\nto achieve security, stability and peace for all humanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHer Excellency Mrs. María Eugenia Brizuela de Ávila,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of El Salvador.\r\nMrs. Brizuela de Ávila (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me to express, on behalf of the people\r\nand the Government of El Salvador, our most sincere\r\ncongratulations to the President on being elected to\r\nconduct the work of this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nLikewise, we would like to express our\r\nrecognition to Mr. Han Seung-soo for the successful\r\nwork he carried out during the past session. We\r\ncommend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his work\r\nand attention in the prevention and solution of\r\nconflicts, and we encourage him to continue moving\r\nforward in the reform process of the United Nations.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nWe welcome to this important world forum the\r\nSwiss Confederation and, soon, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste in their new capacity of\r\nMember States. In this context, we reiterate our request\r\nto review the special international situation of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, whose 23 million\r\ninhabitants are being denied the right to representation\r\nin this forum. We nurture the hope that in the near\r\nfuture the participation in this world Organization of\r\nall the nations of the world without exclusion — as is\r\ncurrently the case with Taiwan — will become a\r\nreality.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador is convinced that\r\nit is necessary to examine new and visionary initiatives\r\nto remove existing obstacles in the discussions on the\r\ncomposition and role of the Security Council in the\r\nnew millennium. That is necessary and essential in\r\norder for the United Nations to continue to be the\r\nprincipal world forum of collective action in the face of\r\nchallenges to international peace and security.\r\nThis year, my country commemorated the tenth\r\nanniversary of the signing of the peace accords, which\r\nput an end to armed conflict and paved the way for a\r\nnew reality of hope, peace, democracy and\r\ndevelopment. Our democratic process has\r\nprogressively been consolidated and is advancing with\r\nnormality within the same dynamic of open debates\r\nand deliberations that characterize all democracies.\r\nThis has been a result of the firm desire of all\r\nSalvadorians to construct a free and democratic society,\r\nwhich we, the Member States, should feel proud of and\r\npart of, through the successful role played by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the economic and social fields, we have\r\nachieved significant progress in strengthening peace\r\nand democracy. The Government of President\r\nFrancisco Flores Pérez has strongly promoted an\r\neconomic model featuring economic rights as a means\r\nto advance towards development and to take advantage\r\nof the opportunities offered by the opportunities of\r\nglobalization. We have also favoured human\r\ndevelopment, investing primarily in education, health,\r\nhousing and basic services, as those areas are\r\nindispensable elements contributing to social well-\r\nbeing, to the improvement in the quality of life of our\r\npeople and to development.\r\nTen years after the signing of the peace accords,\r\nEl Salvador has successfully culminated its peace\r\nprocess and is now enjoying the dividends of peace.\r\nTherefore, we are grateful for the valuable support of\r\nthe international community and of the United Nations.\r\nWe are particularly grateful to the Group of Friends of\r\nthe Secretary-General for the peace process of El\r\nSalvador — Colombia, Mexico, Spain, Venezuela and\r\nthe United States of America — for the support they\r\noffered during the unfolding of that process, whose\r\nsuccessful outcome continues to assist efforts for\r\nconflict resolution throughout the world.\r\nWith regard to Central America, I wish to\r\nreaffirm El Salvador’s spirit of integration, which leads\r\nus to attach high priority to our relations with\r\nneighbouring countries in seeking common\r\ndevelopment for the region and in strengthening the\r\nCentral American integration process in its political,\r\neconomic and social facets. We do so because it is only\r\nthrough a stable and united region that we will be able\r\nto complement one another in order to strengthen our\r\nposition in the world economic environment and jointly\r\nface the challenges of globalization. Only through\r\nintegration will we be able to overcome our narrow\r\nterritorial limitations to effectively respond to the just\r\ndemands of our citizens in the areas of education,\r\nhealth and opportunities for the future. Being united\r\nand open to the world as a region will be the only way\r\nwe will be able to cease to appear small in the face of\r\nthe great challenge of creating, with all the requisite\r\nspeed, more and better jobs so that all our peoples will\r\nbe able to forge for themselves a worthy future in their\r\nown homelands.\r\nIt is in that context that the Presidents of Central\r\nAmerica have agreed on an economic integration plan\r\nof action effective immediately. That plan includes the\r\nformation of a customs union by next year. Likewise,\r\namong other things, we will continue to work on\r\nadopting common duty tariffs and facilitating trade and\r\nthe free movement of all products. With that goal in\r\nmind, and having already attained positive results with\r\nthe Central American agreements now in effect with\r\nMexico, the Dominican Republic, Chile and Panama,\r\nwe are also jointly negotiating free trade agreements\r\nwith Canada and United States. We are also working to\r\nstrengthen and implement the Puebla-Panama Plan by\r\nimplementing eight large meso-American integration\r\nprojects. Through the Puebla-Panama Plan we intend to\r\ntake advantage of the potential of Central America and\r\nof the southern and south-eastern regions of Mexico as\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\na natural corridor linking North and South America and\r\njoining two oceans.\r\nWe have responsibly assumed the historical\r\nchallenge to address through relevant bodies the border\r\ndisagreements inherited by the current generation of\r\nCentral Americans. El Salvador has done its share in\r\nthis regard. We are convinced that strict compliance\r\nwith international law provides the foundation for\r\nharmony among neighbouring countries. We have\r\ntherefore recently reached an agreement at the\r\npresidential level with the Republic of Honduras to\r\naccelerate the demarcation of our territorial borders.\r\nFurthermore, we have also recently resorted to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice to exercise our right to\r\nrequest a revision of its 1992 judgement, but only with\r\nregard to one of the six areas in dispute in the case that\r\nwe jointly submitted in 1986. Through these efforts, El\r\nSalvador and Central America are clearing the way in\r\norder to make unencumbered progress towards the\r\nrealization of our common integration projects. In the\r\nend, our goal is for the borders that we are now\r\ndefining through law to be erased in practice by\r\nharmony, mutual respect and the development of our\r\npeoples.\r\nIn the international sphere — having just\r\ncommemorated the first anniversary of the terrorist\r\nattacks perpetrated in the United States — the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador would like to reiterate its\r\nfirm commitment to the worldwide struggle against\r\nterrorism and all related criminal activities. We view\r\nthis global effort as a joint and individual endeavour of\r\nMember States. Consequently, we see it as an effort\r\nlinked to the deepest respect for the principles\r\nestablished in the Charter of the United Nations, in\r\ninternational law and in international humanitarian law.\r\nIn that connection, the Government of El Salvador\r\nwould like to express its gratitude for the efforts being\r\nmade by the Counter-Terrorism Committee established\r\nby Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We also\r\nreiterate our complete readiness to cooperate in the\r\nunequivocal implementation of that resolution. In\r\naddition, we would like to inform the international\r\ncommunity that El Salvador will host the third session\r\nof the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism.\r\nThat meeting will be held in San Salvador during the\r\nfirst half of 2003. We hope the meeting will adopt\r\nrelevant decisions to further strengthen the hemispheric\r\nfight against this scourge.\r\nEl Salvador recognizes the progress achieved\r\nwith the entry into force of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. In this regard, my\r\nGovernment is carrying out the necessary reviews to\r\nbring our constitutional rules in line with those of the\r\nStatute, so as to enable us to initiate the process of\r\njoining the Court.\r\nIn the same vein, I am also pleased to inform the\r\nAssembly that last week El Salvador ratified the\r\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the\r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\r\nFamilies, as well as the Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of\r\nChildren, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.\r\nIn his report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Secretary-General stated\r\nthat the world in which we live today is divided\r\nbetween rich and poor as never before in human\r\nhistory. That report also pointed out the harsh reality\r\nexperienced by one sixth of all human kind, which\r\ndaily fights to survive in a life and death struggle with\r\nsickness, hunger and natural and human disasters.\r\nMeanwhile, another sixth of mankind has attained\r\nlevels of well-being that would have been\r\nunimaginable just a few decades ago. Between both\r\nextremes there are the 4 billion inhabitants of\r\ndeveloping countries who, although we may no longer\r\nbe living on the verge of disaster, are very far from\r\nachieving the security, capacity and material well-being\r\nenjoyed by the developed world.\r\nAs a developing country, El Salvador is following\r\nthe course charted at Monterrey. We hope that the\r\noffers of funding made by various countries at the\r\nConference will become a reality. We are also actively\r\nparticipating in the preparatory work for the World\r\nSummit on the Information Society, as we are\r\nconvinced of the potential benefits that connectivity\r\nand knowledge will bring to the future development of\r\nfree societies.\r\nIn that sense, El Salvador shares the vision that\r\ninternational cooperation with medium-income\r\ncountries must not be exclusively limited to technical\r\ncooperation. That cooperation should also include\r\nfinancial cooperation, as the fight against poverty\r\nshould not be confined by borders or limited by\r\nstatistics pertaining to national averages. Such figures\r\nare far from being a true reflection of existing realities\r\nin different places. Our renewed democracies need to\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nbe consolidated, strengthened and made sustainable in\r\na way that gives everyone access to a better quality of\r\nlife.\r\nAnother of the major challenges we face, namely,\r\nnatural disasters, could nullify the efforts we have\r\nmade throughout the years. The devastating effects of\r\nsuch phenomena are no longer limited solely to\r\ntraditionally vulnerable regions. As was the case\r\nrecently in many European countries, other regions that\r\npreviously had not been very much affected by natural\r\ndisasters are now experiencing them. In this\r\nconnection, the people and the Government of El\r\nSalvador would like to reiterate their complete\r\nsolidarity with the Governments of affected countries\r\nand with the families that have suffered as a result of\r\nthe devastating floods in Europe.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador calls on the\r\ninternational community to jointly implement the\r\nagreements reached in the five basic areas taken up by\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development that\r\ntook place recently in Johannesburg, South Africa.\r\nThose included water and sanitation, energy, health,\r\nagriculture and biological diversity. All of them are of\r\ncrucial importance to the future of the environment,\r\nparticularly in developing countries.\r\nAllow me to conclude by reiterating the firm\r\ncommitment and political will of the Government of El\r\nSalvador to contribute actively to the search for\r\ncollective and individual solutions to the problems that\r\nwe will take up during this session of the General\r\nAssembly. We also wish to reiterate our confidence in\r\nthe work that the Secretary-General is doing on behalf\r\nof the nations that make up our Organization and on the\r\nbasis of the purposes and principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter. Along with the strengthening of\r\nmultilateralism, those purposes and principles remain\r\nentirely valid in the new millennium.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the\r\nright of reply. May I remind members that statements\r\nin the exercise of the right of reply are limited to 10\r\nminutes for the first intervention and to five minutes\r\nfor the second, and should be made by delegations\r\nfrom their seats.\r\nI call on the representative of Armenia.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): I wish to exercise my\r\nright of reply to the statement about the Armenian\r\ngenocide made yesterday in this Hall by the\r\nrepresentative of Turkey in his exercise of the right to\r\nreply to the statement made by the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Armenia.\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic\r\nof Armenia, in his address during the general debate of\r\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, said\r\nthe following:\r\n“We extend our profound appreciation to all\r\nthose Governments, legislatures and international\r\nbodies that have recognized the Armenian\r\ngenocide and pledge our cooperation to all those\r\nthat are currently in the process of reaffirming the\r\nfacts of that crime against humanity. As a\r\nsignatory to the Convention on the Prevention\r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the\r\nArmenian Government places a high priority on\r\nthe struggle to prevent future genocide and to\r\nstand up against all attempts to deny past\r\ngenocide.” (see A/57/PV.9)\r\nIndeed, I should like to thank the representative\r\nof Turkey for understanding the message correctly and\r\nfor once again bringing the issue of the Armenian\r\ngenocide to the attention of this body.\r\nIn that regard, allow me to make a few comments.\r\nThe twentieth century began for Armenians with the\r\ntragedy of genocide and mass deportations in the\r\nOttoman Empire in 1915 and 1923, which served the\r\ndeliberate, premeditated ultranationalist objective of\r\nwiping out the Armenian community in Ottoman\r\nTurkey. The first genocide of the twentieth century\r\nunfolded in full force and continued until it had\r\nconsumed the lives of 1.5 million Armenians.\r\nThe Armenian genocide is an undeniable and\r\nincontrovertible fact, and that is absolutely clear not\r\nonly to us, but to a large number of countries that have\r\nofficially recognized and condemned the crime of\r\ngenocide committed against the Armenian people. Yet\r\nTurkey spares no effort to deny this shameful event of\r\nits past. There is nothing new about the accusations,\r\nfalsifications and inventions that the Turkish\r\nGovernment is presenting in its futile attempts to deny\r\nor to justify what international law defines as genocide.\r\nThe representative of Turkey made a reference to\r\n“unsubstantiated evidence” of the Armenian genocide.\r\nThe genocide is not something that needs to be proved.\r\nHistorians and scholars have done their job, and\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\nextensive and well-documented evidence of the\r\nArmenian genocide is available in many Turkish,\r\nRussian, British and American archives. It is\r\nregrettable that Turkey has preferred deliberate and\r\nwillful ignorance to a sober and impartial approach.\r\nThe Armenian genocide showed that such an\r\ninhuman crime could be committed. The impunity of\r\nthe genocide policy of the Ottoman Empire brought\r\nnew brutalities. The most striking evidence is Hitler ‘s\r\nrhetorical flourish about his plans to invade Poland in\r\n1939: “Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation\r\nof the Armenians?” Those words can be read in the\r\nHolocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.\r\nI should like to particularly stress one more point,\r\nwhich is of special relevance to the United Nations. In\r\n1948, the Organization adopted the Convention on the\r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\r\nMr. Raphael Lemkin, author of the term “genocide”\r\nand one of the authors of the Convention, emphasized\r\nthe international community’s need for such a\r\nConvention by speaking of the necessity “to prevent\r\nfrom happening again what happened to Armenians\r\nduring World War I and to Jews during World War II”.\r\nRegrettably, Turkey, one of the parties to the\r\nConvention, does not want to acknowledge that denial\r\nis a continuation of genocide or, as some note, it is the\r\nfinal act of genocide.\r\nTurkey’s continuing denial of the genocide of\r\nArmenians in the Ottoman Empire has only intensified\r\nour aspirations to historical justice. Turkey’s pointless\r\ndiversions, accusations and distortions have no bearing\r\non the Armenian genocide, on its international\r\nrecognition or on its scholarly examination. They do,\r\nhowever, make a point about the evil of genocide and\r\nof its denial. Instead of condemning the criminal\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress, in charge of the\r\nOttoman Government during the First World War,\r\nTurkey embraces them today. Instead of distancing\r\nitself from the murderous policy of genocide, Turkey\r\ntirelessly seeks to justify it. That is a destructive policy\r\nthat in no way, shape or form can be construed as a step\r\ntowards healing, reconciling, understanding or\r\nimproving the relations between Turkey and Armenia.\r\nThere is a better way of dealing with the painful past:\r\nnamely, coming to grips with the truth of the matter.\r\nAs President Kocharian said in this Hall two\r\nyears ago in his address before the Millennium\r\nSummit: “Penitence is not humiliation; rather, it\r\nelevates individuals and nations” (A/55/PV.6, p. 11). In\r\nits resolution of 1987, the European Parliament\r\nreferred to the fact that the recognition of the Armenian\r\ngenocide must be viewed as a profoundly humane act\r\nof moral rehabilitation towards the Armenians, which\r\ncan only bring honour to the Turkish Government.\r\nIndeed, many nations have found their spiritual and\r\nmoral resurrection in the surge of validations of the\r\ntruth — in facing their own past squarely.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of Turkey to exercise the second right of\r\nreply, which will be limited to five minutes.\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey): I do not wish to indulge\r\nmyself in a prolonged debate, as I see that it is futile\r\nindeed to expect my Armenian colleague to question at\r\nleast some aspects of his arguments. I would say only\r\nthis. As is very well known, at the end of the First\r\nWorld War, the Armenians, reminding the victorious\r\nPowers that they had also fought as belligerents while\r\nthey were Ottoman subjects, wanted to be represented\r\nat the Paris and Sèvres Conferences. Here, I would like\r\nto quote the Armenian leader Mr. Ali Aharonian\r\nhimself, speaking at the Paris Peace Conference, from\r\nPapers Related to the Foreign Relations of the United\r\nStates: The Paris Peace Conference 1919, printed by\r\nthe Government Printing Office in Washington:\r\n“At the beginning of the war, our nation not\r\nonly forgot all grievances against Tsarist rule and\r\nrallied whole-heartedly to the Russian flag in\r\nsupport of the Allied cause, but our fellow\r\ncountrymen in Turkey and all over the world\r\noffered to the Government of the Czar (the\r\narchives of the Russian Embassy in Paris prove\r\nthis) to establish and support Armenian legions at\r\ntheir own expense to fight side by side with\r\nRussian troops under the command of Russian\r\ngenerals.”\r\nIndeed, in the words of an eminent scholar, whom\r\nsome of our Armenian friends do not like to have\r\nquoted, Professor Bernard Lewis,\r\n“What happened to the Armenians was the\r\nresult of a massive Armenian armed rebellion ...\r\nwhich began even before war broke out and\r\ncontinued on a larger scale. Great numbers of\r\nArmenians ... joined the Russian forces invading\r\nTurkey.”\r\nAnd elsewhere he stated:\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.17\r\n“The Armenians want to benefit from both\r\nworlds. On the one hand, they speak with pride of\r\ntheir struggle against Ottoman despotism, while\r\non the other hand, they compare their tragedy\r\nwith the Jewish genocide.”\r\nLastly, with regard to the process of achieving\r\ninternational recognition, I would like to quote the\r\nspokesperson for the British Foreign Office, Baroness\r\nRamsay of Cartvale, speaking on 14 April 1999:\r\n“The British Government had condemned\r\nthe massacres at the time. But in the absence of\r\nunequivocal evidence that the Ottoman\r\nAdministration took a specific decision to\r\neliminate the Armenians under their control at\r\nthat time, British Governments have not\r\nrecognized those events as indications of\r\ngenocide. Nor do we believe it is the business of\r\nGovernments of today to review events of over 80\r\nyears ago, with a view to pronouncing on them.”\r\nI would like to end my statement by paying\r\ntribute to the memory of all those who perished —\r\nTurks, Armenians and others — who perished at that\r\nvery tragic moment of our shared history.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of Armenia to exercise the second right\r\nof reply, which will be limited to five minutes.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): I apologize for taking\r\nthe floor again. I would like to make just a few\r\nadditional comments on the remarks of the\r\nrepresentative of Turkey. First, I would like to remind\r\nthe representative of Turkey that the Armenian\r\ngenocide began with “Kristallnacht”, the night of 24\r\nApril 1915, the first day of genocide, when more than\r\nthree hundred Armenian intellectuals were brutally\r\nmurdered by Turkish authorities, thus signaling the\r\nbeginning of mass annihilation of Armenians in the\r\nOttoman Empire.\r\nIt is not my intention to go into archives in this\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall. I would just like to quote one\r\nstatement by the Ambassador of Germany, representing\r\na Government allied with Turkey, who reported as\r\nearly as in July 1915,\r\n“The manner in which the relocation is\r\nbeing carried out demonstrates the Government is\r\nreally pursuing the aim of destroying the\r\nArmenian race in Turkey”.\r\nIn July 1917, his successor reported,\r\n“The policy of extermination has largely\r\nbeen achieved. The current leaders of Turkey\r\nfully subscribe to this policy.”\r\nIt is based on those and other facts that back in\r\n1919 the Kemalist Court tried and convicted a number\r\nof high-ranking young Turkish officials for their role in\r\nwhat the Turkish Government then called the massacre\r\nand destruction of the Armenians.\r\nThe unfortunate habit of the Turkish Government\r\nto deny the Armenian genocide continues to manifest\r\nitself in an unending stream of falsifications. If Turkey\r\ntoday encounters difficulties in building normal\r\nrelations with its neighbours, perhaps it is because it\r\nhas such an inconsistent and untenable view of the\r\npast, of the historical record as understood by the rest\r\nof the world. This sadly contorted effort to argue that\r\nevidence of the Armenian genocide is questionable is\r\nbut a reflection of the length to which Turkey is\r\nprepared to go in order to press upon the world its\r\nfictive denial of the truth.\r\nFor the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide it\r\nbehooves them to engage in introspection, to face and\r\nlearn from their history, to question how such violence\r\ncould have occurred, to examine what was there that\r\nlead them down the road to genocide and to find some\r\nredemption through appropriate acts of contrition,\r\nbeginning, but not ending, with knowledge and\r\nacceptance of the truth. If they are unable or unwilling\r\nto deal with the truth, and they still try to maintain\r\ntheir righteous self-image, then they may again find\r\nthemselves on a path towards victimization of other\r\ngroups.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
