(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.35 a.m.\r\nStatement by the President on the occasion of the\r\nInternational Day of Peace\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nfirst speaker for this morning, I should like to recall\r\nthat, by its resolution 55/282, the General Assembly\r\ndecided that, with effect from the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly, the International Day of\r\nPeace shall be observed every year on 21 September.\r\nBy the same resolution, the General Assembly declared\r\nthe International Day of Peace to be a day of global\r\nceasefire and non-violence and invited all nations and\r\npeople to commemorate the day by honouring a\r\n24-hour cessation of hostilities and through, inter alia,\r\neducation and public awareness.\r\nFor the past two decades the United Nations has\r\nbeen commemorating the International Day of Peace.\r\nBy adopting resolution 55/282, however, the General\r\nAssembly not only set a firm date for the observance of\r\nthe International Day of Peace, but also provided a\r\nforum through which the International Day of Peace\r\ncould have a global reach and a practical impact. I\r\nbelieve that the decision adopted at the fifty-fifth\r\nsession of the General Assembly has thus strengthened\r\nthe significance of the Day — a significance which\r\nshould grow even greater in coming years.\r\nAddress by Mr. Gustavo Noboa Bejarano, President\r\nof the Republic of Ecuador\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Gustavo Noboa Bejarano, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Gustavo Noboa Bejarano,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Noboa Bejarano (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMany of the heads of State that have preceded me at\r\nthis rostrum have been eloquent in expressing their\r\nopen condemnation of terrorism, their prescriptions for\r\nthe eradication of extreme poverty, their vision for a\r\nnew international order that will ensure peace and\r\nsecurity in the world and their reservations about a\r\nglobalization process that, if poorly understood, will in\r\nthe end make the gap between rich and poor\r\nunbridgeable.\r\nWe want to stress above all the urgent need to\r\ntake action and to begin to commit new and greater\r\nfinancial resources to development. We must\r\nstrengthen our common bond and work together to try\r\nto find solutions to the problems that affect us all.\r\nWe, the poor countries, are asked to practise\r\nausterity and fiscal discipline, respect the rules of the\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nfree market and free trade and cooperate in the fight\r\nagainst the scourges that afflict humankind. When we\r\ntry to obtain access to the major markets for our goods,\r\nhowever, the door is slammed shut. We are asked to be\r\ncompetitive, but when we take the fruits of our labour\r\nto the market, subsidies amounting to millions of\r\ndollars are placed in our way, making it impossible for\r\nus to even hope to compete.\r\nWe are asked to participate in the fight against\r\ndrug trafficking, but we have not been given the\r\nresources promised us to enable us to carry out our\r\naction plans.\r\nWhen we try to negotiate in a serious and creative\r\nway with international lending agencies, attempts are\r\nmade to impose terms on us — terms that, if accepted,\r\nwould dangerously weaken our young and sometimes\r\nfragile democracies.\r\nPeople don’t understand: our peoples, in their\r\npoverty, are quite perceptive, but they still cannot\r\nunderstand how they can benefit from a globalization\r\nprocess that may never knock at their doors.\r\nWe, the leaders of the developing countries, are\r\nseverely criticized when, upon our return from summits\r\nand forums, we have only meagre results to show, and\r\nwhen the resolve to provide support and cooperation is\r\nweakened because of the actions of a few with respect\r\nto a consensus declaration.\r\nI want to be very clear and simple in expressing\r\nmy thoughts in this universal forum: hypocrisy,\r\ninequity, injustice, increased poverty and failure to take\r\naction, among other ills, are the main reasons for\r\nbreaches of the peace. They create a framework in\r\nwhich violence, sectarian extremism and\r\nmisunderstanding find fertile ground.\r\nThe developed world has found new and\r\ndiscriminatory methods — in financial, social and\r\nethical terms — of categorizing our countries. Some\r\nare willing to perpetuate this perverse way of\r\ncategorizing us on the basis of criteria laid down by\r\nthose that have more than we do. We are criticized for\r\na lack of transparency and for some alleged lack of\r\nrespect for the law, while enormous losses are piling up\r\nowing to corruption. Could it be that the very\r\nfoundations of the capital system have been seriously\r\ndamaged by the scandals that have taken place in the\r\nwealthier and more powerful nations?\r\nOur emigrants are discriminated against, and\r\nsome forget how the most prosperous nations managed\r\nto create their identities through the mixing of races or\r\nby opening their arms to those yearning for progress\r\nand freedom. Developed countries demand the\r\nstrengthening of our institutions and they get quite\r\nlyrical in their support for democratic processes, which\r\noften take forms that lead only to instability. We must\r\nbreak paradigms, and we must do it now. We must not\r\npersist in simplifying, relying on a purely economic\r\nvocabulary, all the benefits of a globalization process\r\nthat is still not understood by all, nor assimilated in\r\neach of its components.\r\nWe speak of free flows of capitals, but these\r\nflows only take the form of transfers of investments in\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere. We countries in the Southern\r\nHemisphere have typically received these same capitals\r\nin the form of expensive loans, whose heavy burden it\r\nhas been impossible to alleviate over time.\r\nWhen the North looks to the South, it sees it with\r\npaternalistic and patronizing eyes. The widely\r\npublicized equity in the terms of exchange is only\r\nvisible in statements, manuals and textbooks of\r\ndeveloped countries. What we need is a new global\r\nethic, one that repudiates terrorism but helps, with the\r\nsame strength and resolve, give substance to our\r\ncreative efforts to eradicate poverty, a poverty that\r\nthreatens the most basic principles of human dignity.\r\nWhen food is lacking, when there is no health or\r\neducation, and when the survival instinct itself is\r\nlimited, very little or nothing can be done to pursue\r\nvalues and ideals cherished by any developed society.\r\nMy country condemns terrorism. My government\r\nsupports every effort to eradicate it, but Ecuador also\r\ndemands the creation of a new coalition and a new\r\norder to fight against poverty.\r\nThis is a new century, a century of solidarity and\r\nhope. But we must also make this century a century of\r\nrespect on the part of all nations for the principles that\r\ngovern international law. Yes, it is a new century, a\r\ncentury in which all activities that violate the sanctity\r\nof human life are condemned and prosecuted. There is\r\nno justification whatsoever for taking the lives of\r\ninnocent persons. We must work with all forces\r\navailable, together under the law, to fight this scourge.\r\nThis is also a century of changes of attitudes and\r\nof proposals, a time in which we must resolve\r\ndefinitively the problem of the debt of the poorest\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\ncountries towards the developed countries. It must be a\r\ntime of opportunity to build a fairer world, a world of\r\nsolidarity.\r\nAs a global citizen, I am concerned that the\r\ncommitment to ensure the very existence of the planet\r\nis not shared equitably by all. Everything is demanded\r\nof those of us who have great diversity and renewable\r\nresources, but, in return, we are denied the financial\r\ntools to seek alternative resources for a development\r\nnot entailing the destruction of our natural resources, as\r\nif this commitment to the environment should fall on\r\nour shoulders alone. We must fight to improve the\r\nquality of life on earth. But the beneficiaries of this\r\nstruggle must be every man and woman on earth, and\r\nnot only those with the good fortune to have been born\r\nin the North.\r\nEcuador, which I am honoured to represent in this\r\nAssembly, is a country committed to the most noble\r\ncauses of the international community. No effort will\r\nbe spared to enable our people to reach a human\r\nsociety in which men, women and children, without\r\ndistinction, without exclusion, can develop fully and\r\nflourish.\r\nEcuador wants to be an ethical model that looks\r\nto the future. We wish to see the voice of reason heard\r\nin every global forum. We want to create a world of\r\nfreedom, a more just and united society. We would like,\r\nfrom the centre of the two hemispheres, to be a bridge\r\nuniting North and South, two regions that should walk\r\ntogether towards development and not be separated by\r\ngeographic conventions.\r\nThank you so much, distinguished delegates, for\r\nthis extraordinary opportunity to address the world\r\ncommunity. Thank you for your continuing efforts to\r\nmake the United Nations the highest forum of\r\ninternational debate. My country and my Government\r\nview this body as the highest forum for debate and for\r\nthe settlement of those problems that constantly affect\r\nhumankind.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ecuador for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gustavo Noboa Bejarano, President of\r\nEcuador, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency, Mr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan\r\nKabbah, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nMr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency, Mr. Alhaji Ahmad Tejan\r\nKabbah, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Kabbah (Sierra Leone): Two years ago I\r\ncame to the rostrum of this Assembly with mixed\r\nfeelings. On the one hand, my country had just\r\nwitnessed an unprovoked attempt to derail the peace\r\nprocess. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone\r\n(UNAMSIL) was still recovering from a brazen affront\r\nto its military capability and the authority of the\r\nSecurity Council. On the other hand, I was optimistic,\r\nfirst of all because the people of Sierra Leone had once\r\nagain demonstrated their resolve to maintain their\r\nstruggle for peace. I was also optimistic because the\r\nSecurity Council had responded appropriately by\r\ngiving UNAMSIL additional responsibilities within its\r\nmandate, and by increasing the troop level of the\r\nmission.\r\nToday, I stand here with only one feeling, an\r\noverwhelming feeling of joy. At long last the rebel war\r\nin Sierra Leone is over. All combatants have been\r\ndisarmed and demobilized. Reintegration is well under\r\nway. Over 55,000 ex-combatants are currently engaged\r\nin reintegration programme activities, ranging from\r\nformal education and vocational-skills training to\r\nsmall-scale trade, agriculture and community\r\ndevelopment. While the National Commission on\r\nDisarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration is\r\nconcentrating on the integration of ex-combatants,\r\nanother national agency, the National Commission for\r\nSocial Action, is actively engaged in programmes that\r\nwill benefit all categories of victims of the brutal war,\r\nparticularly the most vulnerable population groups.\r\nMost heartening of the recent positive\r\ndevelopments was the affirmation four months ago by\r\nthe people of Sierra Leone that they would never forgo\r\ntheir constitutional right to choose their leaders freely\r\nthrough the ballot box. They sent a resounding message\r\nto the entire world that, in Africa, it is still possible to\r\nhold free and fair elections.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nOur objective was not merely to win the rebel\r\nwar, but to defend the right of our people to live. We\r\nfought against a brutal attempt by a few who, with the\r\nassistance of forces within and outside the subregion,\r\nwere determined to assume power and gain unimpeded\r\nand perpetual access to our mineral resources. My\r\nprimary objective as the democratically elected leader\r\nwas for us to win the peace. Today, I am pleased to say\r\nhere that the people of Sierra Leone are continuing to\r\nwork assiduously to win the peace.\r\nWe share the view that there cannot be real peace\r\nin Sierra Leone without justice. The support that we\r\nhave so far received for the establishment of a special\r\ncourt to bring to justice those who bear the greatest\r\nresponsibility for serious breaches of international\r\nhumanitarian law and the national laws of Sierra Leone\r\nshould also be regarded as part of the peace dividend.\r\nWe are also convinced that we cannot speak about\r\nlasting peace in Sierra Leone without national\r\nreconciliation. Making the Truth and Reconciliation\r\nCommission fully operational after its inauguration in\r\nJuly 2002 has now become one of our major\r\npreoccupations. Let me add, however, that inadequate\r\ninternational support for the Commission could\r\njeopardize prospects for national reconciliation which,\r\nmembers will agree with me, is one of the prerequisites\r\nof lasting peace and justice.\r\nThe victory that the people of Sierra Leone have\r\nso far achieved in the peace process is theirs, but not\r\ntheirs alone. It is also a victory for the United Nations,\r\nthe Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and the entire international community.\r\nIndeed, it is a victory for humanity, for all those who\r\ncherish the dignity and worth of the human person.\r\nTherefore, let me take this opportunity, on behalf of\r\nevery Sierra Leonean, to express our profound and\r\nsincere gratitude to the United Nations family,\r\nECOWAS and its Monitoring Group, and other regional\r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\r\nfor their support in our prolonged struggle. This was a\r\npartnership for peace and security that we will never\r\nforget.\r\nWith your permission, Sir, I am obliged once\r\nagain to single out for commendation some special\r\nfriendly States that played a crucial role in that effort. I\r\nrefer to the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of\r\nNigeria, the Republics of Guinea, Ghana and Mali, and\r\nthe United States of America and China, among others.\r\nWe will always remember their place in the great\r\npartnership for peace and security that wrenched Sierra\r\nLeone from the verge of total destruction. This is what\r\ncollective responsibility is all about in our\r\ninterdependent world.\r\nWhile we celebrate our mutual success, we\r\nshould at the same time be aware of the challenges that\r\nwe face not only in Sierra Leone, but also in the Mano\r\nRiver Union and the West African subregions. Our\r\nsuccess notwithstanding, the situation in our part of the\r\ncontinent continues to pose a threat to international\r\npeace and security. That threat will remain and could\r\nincrease if we fail to consolidate the gains that we have\r\nmade in Sierra Leone. I should therefore like to\r\nreiterate my recent appeal to the United Nations and\r\nthe international community as a whole to remain\r\nengaged in our national effort to consolidate our hard-\r\nwon peace. I was encouraged that, following the May\r\n2002 elections, the Secretary-General and the President\r\nof the Security Council underscored the need to further\r\nconsolidate what we have achieved so far.\r\nThe people of Sierra Leone and the international\r\ncommunity have made considerable investment in\r\nmaterial and human resources to bring us to the stage at\r\nwhich we find ourselves today. It would be a terrible\r\nmistake if, by sheer complacency and a failure to adopt\r\nthe appropriate course of action, we should allow the\r\ncountry to slip back into armed conflict. We share the\r\nview of the Secretary-General, expressed in his latest\r\nreport on UNAMSIL, that the Organization should\r\nensure that the next phase of the Mission does not\r\njeopardize the progress achieved so far in stabilizing\r\npeace in Sierra Leone.\r\nBeyond Sierra Leone, there are ominous signs of\r\nspillover conflicts hovering around the subregion. It\r\nwould also be tragic if we should underestimate the\r\ncurrent threat to peace and go on procrastinating about\r\nways of preventing a spillover.\r\nHow then do we go about ensuring, at least in the\r\nshort run, that Sierra Leone will sustain its newly-won\r\npeace? How do we contain the current hostilities across\r\nthe border with Liberia? The need to address these\r\nquestions has become more urgent as we approach the\r\nend of the current mandate of UNAMSIL. While\r\nlooking forward to the new phase of that important\r\ninstrument of peace, I thought that I should draw the\r\nattention of the Security Council, through the\r\nSecretary-General, to some of the issues that could be\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\ntaken into consideration and linked to an exit strategy\r\nfor UNAMSIL.\r\nRecently, I shared my thoughts on this and related\r\nmatters in a letter which I addressed to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The letter has since been circulated as\r\nSecurity Council document S/2002/975 of 29 August\r\n2002. Permit me to highlight some of the issues raised\r\nin that communication. These are issues related to the\r\ncapacity of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces and the\r\nSierra Leone police to perform their respective\r\nfunctions more effectively throughout the country; the\r\nchallenges facing us in the integration of all ex-\r\ncombatants; the risks following from the turbulent\r\nsituation in neighbouring Liberia, and particularly its\r\nrepercussions for peace and stability in Sierra Leone\r\nand the Mano River Union as a whole; the danger of\r\nthe apparent absence of a strategic plan of the\r\ninternational community to address the situation in\r\nLiberia, especially as the country approaches crucial\r\nelections next year; and finally, the delay in responding\r\nto the request for international assistance to ECOWAS\r\nin ensuring security on the borders shared by Guinea,\r\nLiberia and Sierra Leone.\r\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General has\r\ntaken these and other issues into account in preparing\r\nhis recommendations to the Security Council for a\r\nmeasured and phased downsizing of UNAMSIL. This\r\nwill ensure that we do not provoke any new sense of\r\ninsecurity in a population that has been traumatized for\r\ntoo long. I am also confident that the Security Council\r\nwill consider the recommendations carefully, especially\r\nin the light of my Government’s and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s own assessment that the conflict in Liberia\r\nstill constitutes the most serious threat to the stability\r\nthat now prevails in Sierra Leone. Who will forget that\r\nthe 10-year rebel war in Sierra Leone was launched\r\nfrom the territory of Liberia?\r\nThe current state of peace and security in Sierra\r\nLeone and the rest of the Mano River Union subregion\r\nis obviously a matter of constant concern to us.\r\nHowever, as a member of the global community, we are\r\nalso seriously concerned about impediments to\r\ninternational cooperation for economic and social\r\ndevelopment; about threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, including the nuclear arms race and terrorism\r\nin all its forms and manifestations; and about the rights\r\nof such vulnerable population groups as children and\r\npeople with disabilities. All those often require\r\nappropriate multilateral agreements or arrangements to\r\nensure that they are effectively addressed.\r\nNever since the end of the Second World War has\r\nmultilateral cooperation become such a necessary\r\nmeans for resolving international disputes and for\r\nensuring the well-being of people everywhere. Sierra\r\nLeone, therefore, attaches the utmost importance to the\r\nstrengthening of multilateral cooperation, as reflected\r\nby such recent conferences as the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. Those\r\nprovide effective platforms for articulating the interests\r\nof all States and for devising common strategies to\r\naddress collectively problems that would otherwise\r\noverwhelm the capacities of individual countries or\r\nregions.\r\nIt is, therefore, self-evident that we must continue\r\nto pursue the multilateral approach to those and other\r\ninternational issues. The consequences of diminishing\r\nor bypassing the multilateral approach in matters that\r\naffect the lives of millions of people worldwide could,\r\nI should emphasize, be disastrous for us all.\r\nTwo years ago, in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nheads of State and Government, in the spirit of\r\ninterdependence, made a commitment to work together\r\nin achieving specific goals in areas such as peace,\r\nsecurity and disarmament, human rights, good\r\ngovernance and poverty eradication. Those goals are\r\nall underpinned by a strong belief in the principles of\r\nmultilateral cooperation and shared interests.\r\nOf special significance to us are the commitments\r\nmade by the world leaders in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration to meet the special needs of Africa. That is\r\nnot only because Africa has the largest number of\r\ncountries classified as least developed, and in which\r\nalmost half the population lives in abject poverty. It is\r\nalso because we have all benefited and stand to benefit\r\nfrom each other’s resources.\r\nIn spite of its current level of overall\r\ndevelopment, Africa has a lot to offer to the rest of the\r\nworld. Of course, we Africans realize our\r\nresponsibility, first and foremost, to develop and\r\nimplement strategies for improving the quality of life\r\nof our people and for strengthening our capacity to\r\ncontribute more effectively to the economies of our\r\npartners in the developed world.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nIn effect, that is what the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) is all about —\r\npartnership among African countries, partnership with\r\nthe rest of the world and progress for all mankind. It is\r\nin that context that the conclusions reached at the high-\r\nlevel meeting of the Assembly earlier this week on\r\nways and means of supporting NEPAD assume\r\nsupreme importance for my country.\r\nIn a similar vein, Sierra Leone also welcomes the\r\ncommitment of the eight major industrialized countries,\r\nthe G-8, at their recent meeting in Canada, to provide\r\nstrong support to NEPAD and to establish enhanced\r\npartnerships with African countries whose performance\r\nreflects the NEPAD commitments. Sierra Leone, for its\r\npart, is determined to pursue vigorously the objectives\r\nset out in NEPAD, not just because we need donor\r\nassistance at this time, but more so because we believe\r\nin the soundness of those objectives as a vehicle for the\r\neradication of extreme poverty, the achievement of\r\nsustainable development and the assumption of greater\r\nresponsibility for our own destiny.\r\nI began by assuring the Assembly that I came this\r\ntime with one overwhelming feeling, a feeling of joy\r\nover recent developments in my country. Of course, the\r\nsearch for sustainable peace with justice and national\r\nreconciliation is a continuous process, and we are well\r\naware of the challenges that we still have to face.\r\nHowever, I can say with confidence that what we have\r\nso far achieved, with the support of the United Nations\r\nand the international community, has provided the\r\nmomentum for us to meet those challenges.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Sierra Leone for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, President of the\r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I wish to make a very brief\r\nannouncement. As announced in today’s Journal, the\r\nGeneral Assembly will consider this afternoon,\r\nimmediately upon conclusion of the general debate, the\r\nreport of the General Committee, contained in\r\ndocument A/57/250, as well as the request for the\r\ninclusion of an additional sub-item of the agenda of the\r\nfifty-seventh session, contained in document A/57/231.\r\nAddress by Mr. Askar Akayev, President of the\r\nKyrgyz Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Askar Akayev,\r\nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Askar Akayev, President of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Askar Akayev, President of\r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, and to invite him to address the\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Akayev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to the lofty post of President of this\r\nrepresentative world forum and to wish you every\r\nsuccess in your work. Your election as President of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly is\r\nsymbolic not only of the personal respect you hold, but\r\nalso of the authority your country enjoys in the world\r\ncommunity. In recent decades, the Czech Republic has\r\nbeen through some hard times. Because of that, you\r\nwell understand the problems of Kyrgyzstan, which is\r\ngoing through a transition from its authoritarian past to\r\na democratic future.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo for his excellent work as the President of the\r\nprevious session. The present session is significant in\r\nthat the Swiss Confederation and, soon, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of East Timor will have become Members of\r\nthe United Nations. We warmly welcome the\r\nrepresentatives of those countries, who are\r\nparticipating in this session of the General Assembly.\r\nThis is my first address from the rostrum of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as President of the sovereign\r\nKyrgyz Republic. 11 years have passed since the State\r\nof Kyrgyzstan declared its independence. What has\r\nbrought me to the Assembly is my desire to share with\r\nyou my thoughts on the most pressing problems of our\r\nnational development.\r\nFirst, I would like to refer to the International\r\nYear of Mountains, which is being celebrated this year\r\npursuant to a resolution adopted at the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\r\nIt was proclaimed at the initiative of Kyrgyzstan and\r\nother mountainous countries, for which the problem of\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nthe development of mountainous areas is of crucial\r\nimportance. We are very grateful for the support given\r\nto that initiative. Thanks to the efforts of the United\r\nNations, important events have already taken place at\r\nthe regional and national levels. The outcome of the\r\nwork done will be discussed at the Global Mountain\r\nSummit, to be held in our capital, Bishkek, at the end\r\nof October. We will create the most favourable\r\nconditions for its work, in the best tradition of Kyrgyz\r\nwarmth and hospitality.\r\nI believe the delegates present in the Hall will\r\nagree that among the many complex challenges facing\r\nthe world community, the most pressing problems are\r\ndeveloping democracy and guaranteeing human rights\r\nand freedoms. Those goals have been made a top\r\npriority in the Kyrgyz Republic since the earliest days\r\nof its establishment.\r\nWe are convinced that in modern day conditions,\r\nunless there is consistent democratization and human\r\nemancipation, progress and prosperity cannot be\r\nachieved. However, the remnants of the authoritarian\r\nSoviet heritage still has a tenacious hold on the minds\r\nof our people, especially among the elderly. There is\r\ngood reason why former Soviet States are referred to in\r\ninternational classifications as transitional countries.\r\nOur experience has shown that the process of transition\r\nis particularly difficult not only in the area of the\r\neconomy but in the minds of people.\r\nOn our road towards democracy, we have\r\nexperienced both joyful success and bitter failure.\r\nWhen we analysed our failures, we came to understand\r\nthat their main cause was a lack of democracy. In order\r\nto give the development of democracy a new and\r\npowerful impetus, I as President proclaimed a new\r\nnational idea: Kyrgyzstan, a country of human rights.\r\nWe intend to elaborate a democratic code and to\r\nestablish a council for democratic security. Recently, in\r\norder to further the process of democratization, I took\r\nthe decision to reform our Constitution and to convene\r\na Constitutional Assembly. During my stay in the\r\nUnited States, the Constitutional Assembly is at the\r\nconcluding stage of its work. The difficulty is that\r\nsociety has different approaches for developing\r\ndemocracy. Some forces claiming to be ardent\r\nsupporters of democracy consider the essence of\r\ndemocracy to be the destruction of existing structures\r\nand the undertaking of new experiments. That would\r\ncause the transition from authoritarianism to\r\ndemocracy to take a very long time, indeed, while\r\npeople have long awaited stability. On behalf of the\r\npeople of Kyrgyzstan, I would like to assure the world\r\ncommunity that we adhere to the principles of\r\ndemocracy and will confidently follow that path\r\ndespite the difficulties and obstacles that we encounter.\r\nI consider the problem of poverty eradication to\r\nbe as important as the problem of the development of\r\ndemocracy. The problem has worsened under present\r\nconditions in the post-Soviet period. We are not the\r\nonly poor country in the world. There are many reasons\r\nfor this, and I do not intend to analyse them in my\r\nstatement. Poverty has a negative impact on people’s\r\nmorale and creates many obstacles to developing the\r\ndemocratic process. Moreover, poverty is a breeding\r\nground for extremism and international terrorism.\r\nThe world community has repeatedly declared its\r\nresolve to help countries in need to overcome poverty.\r\nMr. George Bush, the President of the United States,\r\npromised to substantially increase assistance to poor\r\ncountries when he announced the creation of the\r\nMillennium Challenge Account. We are grateful for\r\nevery initiative of the United Nations, the United\r\nNations Development Programme and other\r\ninternational organizations, as well as of donor\r\ncountries, for their assistance to poor countries.\r\nHowever, those efforts are still not sufficient.\r\nFollowing the example of my colleagues from\r\nother poor countries, I would like to call upon the\r\nworld community not to slacken its efforts in the\r\ncampaign against poverty and to find new resources\r\nand new approaches in solving this problem. That\r\nwould help reduce pockets of instability, encourage the\r\ndevelopment of democracy and have a positive impact\r\non the world’s development as a whole.\r\nI would like to refer to the problem of\r\ninternational terrorism, which is the main danger to the\r\nworld. New York, where the Assembly is now\r\ngathered, was witness to a terrible tragedy which\r\nshowed the horrendous, brute face of terrorism. The\r\nKyrgyz Republic, which in past years experienced\r\nincursions into its territory by international terrorist\r\ngroups, has strongly supported the call of the President\r\nof the United States of America, Mr. George Bush, to\r\ncreate an anti-terrorism coalition. Together with Russia\r\nand our other partners and allies, Kyrgyzstan joined the\r\ncampaign against the horrendous, bestial face of\r\nterrorism. We very much appreciate the work of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council,\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nand I assure you that Kyrgyzstan will extend all\r\npossible assistance to the Committee in its work.\r\nAt the global, regional and national levels,\r\nKyrgyzstan is actively participating in the struggle\r\nagainst international terrorism. We have put our\r\nterritory at the disposition of the military forces of the\r\nanti-terrorism coalition. In December of last year, our\r\ncapital, Bishkek, hosted an international conference\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to\r\nstrengthen comprehensive efforts to fight international\r\nterrorism. A Declaration and Programme of Action\r\nadopted at that time established a firm foundation for\r\naction at the global level.\r\nMr. Noboa Bejarano (Ecuador), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAnti-terrorism centres have been established\r\nwithin the framework of the Shanghai Organization of\r\nCooperation and the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates. Within the framework of the Collective Security\r\nTreaty, Collective Rapid Deployment Forces have been\r\nestablished with headquarters in Bishkek.\r\nHowever, there are still many unresolved issues\r\nconfronting the anti-terrorist coalition in Afghanistan,\r\nwhere, until recently, the main redoubt of international\r\nterrorism was located. On 23 September I will be\r\nmeeting with President George Bush in the White\r\nHouse. I believe that the question of our cooperation in\r\nthe struggle against terrorism will be a top priority. I\r\nintend to assure the President of the United States that\r\nKyrgyzstan, acting together with Russia and our other\r\npartners, will discharge its responsibility.\r\nOne of the most important points of my statement\r\nto the General Assembly is to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to a major event in the Kyrgyz Republic. I am\r\nreferring to the fact that, next year, in 2003, our people\r\nwill be celebrating the 2,200th anniversary of Kyrgyz\r\nStatehood. Taking into account the wishes of wide\r\nsegments of our society, I, as President, issued an edict\r\nproclaiming 2003 the year of Kyrgyz Statehood.\r\nFor the newly independent States that emerged\r\nfrom the collapse of the Soviet Union, a search for our\r\nhistoric and ethnic roots has become a vital task. I am\r\nsure that, at the dawn of their independence, many\r\nStates that are now represented in the United Nations\r\nexperienced the same desire. Research carried out by\r\nour historians and a study of the works of well-known\r\norientalists have led us to the conclusion the formation\r\nof the first Kyrgyz State took place at the end of the\r\nthird century B. C. This has been convincingly borne\r\nout by ancient Chinese chronicles. The famous Chinese\r\nchronicler Sima Qian, who is considered to be the\r\nChinese Herodotus, drew up a chronicle in verse about\r\nthe existence in far-off times of a Kyrgyz State in the\r\nform of a Kyrgyz princedom. That State flourished at\r\ncertain periods and at others merely smouldered. But\r\nnational Statehood was carried forward by the Kyrgyz\r\npeople for many centuries up to the end of the\r\ntwentieth century, when it took the form of the Kyrgyz\r\nRepublic, which later became a Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI would like to remind the Assembly that, in\r\n1995, the Kyrgyz people celebrated a great event,\r\nnamely, the one thousandth anniversary of our great\r\nwork of folk literature, the heroic epic Manas. We are\r\nvery grateful to the United Nations for the decision it\r\ntook at the time to give that event international\r\nresonance. The celebration in Kyrgyzstan of the one\r\nthousandth anniversary of the Manas epic took place\r\nwith great enthusiasm. That contributed to an\r\nunprecedented revival of national spirit and to the unity\r\nof our people.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I wish to address the\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and all the delegations\r\nparticipating in the work of the current session to ask\r\nthem to adopt a decision to recognize as a great historic\r\nevent in the life our country the 2,200th anniversary of\r\nKyrgyz Statehood, and to give it international status.\r\nThat would be accepted by my people with profound\r\ngratitude. It would also do much to promote domestic\r\nstability and further consolidate the multi-ethnic nature\r\nof my nation. In cooperation with other delegations,\r\nmy delegation will submit an appropriate draft\r\nresolution on this subject that I, as President of\r\nKyrgyzstan, would ask the Assembly to support.\r\nKyrgyzstan’s cooperation with the United Nations\r\nis multilateral in nature. It encompasses a wide\r\nspectrum of problems of interest to us all. We have\r\nreceived unwavering support and assistance from the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies at every\r\nstage of our development since the proclamation of\r\nState independence. I should like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our sincere gratitude for that\r\nassistance. I also wish to proclaim from this rostrum\r\nthat Kyrgyzstan will in the future remain firmly\r\ncommitted to the purposes and principles of the\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nOrganization, and that we will do whatever we can to\r\nmake them a reality.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Kyrgyz Republic for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini, Prime\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency\r\nThe Right Honourable Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini,\r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nHis Excellency The Right Honourable Sibusiso\r\nBarnabas Dlamini, Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): It is an honour for me\r\nto address the General Assembly on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland. I bring with\r\nme the warm greetings and best wishes of His Majesty\r\nKing Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the\r\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation to all\r\nmembers of the United Nations family.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joined the rest of the\r\nworld in sadness to commemorate the first anniversary\r\nof the monstrous acts that took place in September last\r\nyear. Our hearts once again reached out to all those\r\nwho suffered on that fateful day here in New York and\r\nelsewhere in the United States, and to all those whose\r\nlives have been affected by subsequent events around\r\nthe world.\r\nIn the aftermath of 11 September, the world is\r\nunderstandably preoccupied with the question of\r\nsecurity and the war against terror. The Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland reiterates its strong commitment to do all in\r\nits power to support the global alliance against\r\nterrorism, and is determined to ensure that no aspect of\r\nterrorism, including its financing and organization,\r\nmay be permitted to take root within our borders.\r\nThe progress made in some areas of Africa is part\r\nof a general trend of optimism that is spreading among\r\nall the countries on our continent. We cannot deny that\r\nthere remain many serious challenges to address, both\r\nin terms of conflict situations and in terms of overall\r\ndevelopment. We have placed our trust in the African\r\nUnion to be the vehicle for this shift away from the\r\nunderdevelopment of the past, and the Kingdom of\r\nSwaziland looks forward to working with its fellow\r\nmembers to make the new body one that will truly\r\naddress the challenges and make a real difference in the\r\nlives of our peoples.\r\nOf crucial importance to the success of the\r\nAfrican Union is the role of the developed world in\r\nliving up to its commitments to the continent and to all\r\nin the developing world.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to develop\r\npeacefully and quietly, according to the aspirations and\r\nexpectations of its people. Our relationship with the\r\ninternational community remains founded on the\r\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence with all, on the\r\nresolution of all disputes through peaceful dialogue,\r\nand on mutual respect and due regard for the\r\nsovereignty of independent nations. We value our\r\nmembership in the United Nations and other\r\ninternational, regional and subregional organizations.\r\nOur cooperation and friendship with other countries of\r\nthe world give us an important instrument through\r\nwhich we can address our national economic, social\r\nand humanitarian concerns. Of particular importance\r\nare our access to international markets for our goods\r\nand the attraction of foreign direct investment: both are\r\ncentral to our efforts to improve our economy and to\r\nprovide jobs for our people.\r\nPoverty alleviation remains our number-one\r\npriority. Sixty-six per cent of our people are living\r\nbelow the internationally recognized poverty line, and\r\nyet our classification as a lower-middle-income\r\ncountry denies us many of the funds and resources that\r\nare available to those in other categories. We will be\r\nworking with the United Nations to ensure that that\r\nsituation is corrected.\r\nIn the meantime, we are focusing all our efforts\r\nand available resources on programmes that meet the\r\nchallenge of poverty in a sustainable and equitable\r\nmanner. Our national development strategy, which is\r\nthe result of direct consultation with the people\r\nthemselves, provides us with a blueprint for\r\nGovernment action and conforms precisely to the\r\nprinciples of Agenda 21.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nDespite all our best efforts and our limited\r\nsuccess in many areas, we are restricted in our capacity\r\nto meet our objectives, not only by our lack of access\r\nto development funds, but also by a multitude of\r\nproblems that are affecting us simultaneously and that\r\nwe cannot overcome on our own. As is the case with all\r\ndeveloping countries, we are particularly at risk in\r\ntimes of global economic difficulties and are especially\r\nvulnerable to disease and to the effects of changing\r\nweather patterns.\r\nOvershadowing all our development challenges,\r\nhowever, is the threat posed by multiple health risks,\r\nincluding malaria and tuberculosis, but especially\r\nHIV/AIDS. AIDS continues to claim the lives of huge\r\nnumbers of Swazis, and no family in our Kingdom has\r\nescaped the deadly touch of that disease. No sector of\r\ndevelopment is immune from the consequences of the\r\nvery high and increasing HIV infection rates among\r\nour people, with enormous strain placed on our\r\nfinancial and human resources in the battle to cope.\r\nWe are trying our best in the light of our limited\r\nresources. A national emergency response committee\r\non HIV/AIDS has been established to provide the focus\r\nfor our efforts. We are attacking the enemy on various\r\nfronts, with priority placed on prevention, care,\r\ncounselling and treatment. Perhaps the greatest tragedy\r\nis the effect on children who have lost their parents to\r\nthe disease. We are battling to provide those\r\nunfortunate orphans with the means to continue normal\r\nlives, especially with regard to food, clothing and\r\nschooling.\r\nWe are ready to embrace approved strategies of\r\nmedical care, including those that reduce mother-to-\r\nchild transmission of the virus, and the prescription of\r\nanti-retrovirals for those who need them. However, the\r\nsimple fact is that we cannot afford those costly drugs,\r\nand we must rely on the sympathy and support of\r\nothers. That is why the Kingdom was encouraged by\r\nthe expressions of commitment at last year’s AIDS\r\nSummit and by the creation of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. With our hopes\r\nhigh for support from the Fund, it came as a grave\r\ndisappointment to our people that our application to the\r\nFund earlier this year had been rejected and that the\r\ncriteria for selection of projects had become unclear.\r\nWe earnestly hope that our second application will\r\nmeet with approval and that international support from\r\nthat resource, and from those of all who pledged their\r\nsolemn commitments, may at last be forthcoming to\r\nhelp us in this national disaster.\r\nIn the meantime, we look to our own resources to\r\nfight the battle. One answer lies in the rediscovery of\r\npractices that are within our own traditions and culture.\r\nWe have resurrected the rites of chastity and respect for\r\nself that served our people well for many generations\r\nin the past, and these are finding increasing acceptance\r\nin our nation, especially among the younger generation.\r\nAs we announced last year, His Majesty has also\r\nreached out to the international entertainment\r\ncommunity for support, and we have been\r\noverwhelmed by the positive and heart-warming\r\nresponse. Next month will see the release of an album\r\nof music from international artists, entitled “Songs for\r\nLife”, whose proceeds will go entirely to HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes in southern Africa. We look forward with\r\ngreat confidence to the success of the album, with its\r\naims of promoting global awareness of the crisis in\r\nmany countries and of raising funds on a scale that will\r\nhelp those of us most affected to cope with its dreadful\r\nconsequences.\r\nAt precisely this moment of maximum\r\ndisadvantage, the Kingdom of Swaziland and others in\r\nthe southern African region have been hit hard by food\r\nshortages that are affecting 21 per cent of our people,\r\nlargely as a result of lack of rain. We have been warned\r\nthat the situation will deteriorate further next season\r\nwith the likely advent of the El Niño effect.\r\nFurthermore, the food security situation has been\r\nexacerbated by other problems, such as the lack of\r\nclean drinking water in rural areas and the prevalence\r\nof HIV/AIDS-related illnesses and deaths, which leave\r\nfamilies with severely diminished resources to meet\r\ntheir basic needs.\r\nUsing our scarce resources, we are making every\r\neffort to help our people, and we have made one of our\r\ntop priorities the construction of dams throughout the\r\nrural areas, where the crisis is the most serious. The\r\nKingdom of Swaziland is grateful to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and to the United Nations agencies for their\r\nefforts to address those problems through the launching\r\nof a United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal\r\nin response to the humanitarian crisis in southern\r\nAfrica. We are grateful for the response to the Appeal,\r\nand we hope for increased support as the famine\r\ntightens its grip on us.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nWe appreciate the direct involvement of the\r\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General on the\r\nhumanitarian crisis in our region, Mr. James Morris,\r\nand we look forward to working with him, and with all\r\nour international friends and partners, who have\r\nalready been so generous with emergency food aid, to\r\nmake it through this latest crisis for the Swazi nation.\r\nThe review of the Kingdom’s constitution\r\ncontinues, and the drafting stage is almost complete.\r\nThe next phase will be the people’s review of the draft\r\ndocument to ensure that their wishes have been met.\r\nThat will be the final stage before the document is\r\nformally adopted. We trust that the international\r\ncommunity will respect the fact that this final\r\ndocument, the product of extensive consultation with\r\nthe whole nation, will be the true expression of the\r\nwishes of the people themselves, and will serve the\r\nKingdom of Swaziland well for many generations to\r\ncome. We are grateful to all who have supported us in\r\nthis nation-building exercise.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would like to extend\r\na warm welcome to the United Nations newest\r\nMember, Switzerland, and soon-to-be Member East\r\nTimor. There now remains just one group of people\r\nthat is denied the opportunity to participate in the\r\nactivities of the United Nations and its associated\r\nagencies. I refer here to the 23 million inhabitants of\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, a sovereign State and\r\na constructive member of the international community.\r\nThese 23 million people have shown time and\r\nagain that they are willing and able to contribute to the\r\ninternational community. At this critical time in the\r\nhistory of the world, which is faced with the challenges\r\nof instability, under-development and economic\r\ndifficulties, we cannot afford to exclude from our joint\r\nefforts the resources and skills of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan. As a democratic, prosperous and\r\npeace-loving nation, Taiwan has displayed her\r\nreadiness to assist the development challenges of her\r\nfriends and partners, and has intervened in\r\nhumanitarian crises across the globe. Taiwan needs the\r\nUnited Nations, and the United Nations needs Taiwan.\r\nWe therefore appeal once more to our fellow Members\r\nto recognize the right of the 23 million people of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to representation in the\r\nUnited Nations system, and to take the appropriate\r\nmeasures to achieve this objective.\r\nWe are living in dangerous times. Global tension\r\nand the possibility of wide-scale conflict threaten all\r\nthe hopes for a century of peace, stability and\r\nsustainable development that were expressed at our\r\nMillennium Summit just two short years ago.\r\nOur strength as an Organization depends on\r\nconsultation and consensus among all Member States\r\nin matters that affect the whole world. The summits\r\nand special sessions that we all attend at great cost are\r\nvaluable only insofar as we carry through the\r\nresolutions we arrive at and the commitments we make.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\r\nfundamental principles on which the United Nations\r\nwas founded still present the best and only chance for\r\nhumankind to live and work in harmony with one\r\nanother.\r\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland here reaffirms her\r\nfull commitment to the founding Charter of our\r\nOrganization and offers her fullest support to all its\r\nactivities that have as their aim to make this world of\r\nours safer, more equal and healthier for all its people.\r\nWe look forward to working with the United Nations\r\nand her associated agencies in the coming year, to help\r\nus to meet the development challenges of our people.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Kristiina Ojuland.\r\nMrs. Ojuland (Estonia): Let me begin by\r\nwelcoming the United Nations new Member,\r\nSwitzerland who has always been devoted to the cause\r\nof the United Nations and has now finally decided to\r\njoin us. I look forward to welcoming East Timor as the\r\nnewest Member of the Organization in the very near\r\nfuture. I would also like to pass on my congratulations\r\nto the newly elected President of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nToday I would like to address three subjects of\r\nmajor concern for our globalizing world: the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism, human trafficking, and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nA year ago today, the whole world was still\r\nrecoiling from the horrendous terrorist attacks in the\r\nUnited States. Immediately after the terror attacks,\r\nmost States, including Estonia, and almost all\r\ninternational organizations expressed their solidarity\r\nwith the United States.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nWe also associated ourselves with the North\r\nAtlantic Council’s statement of 12 September 2001,\r\nwhich invoked article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as\r\nwell as with relevant European Union statements and\r\nundertakings.\r\nEstonia is actively participating in the\r\ninternational coalition to combat terrorism. We have\r\ncontributed a search and rescue team to Operation\r\nEnduring Freedom under United States leadership. Our\r\nhighly trained explosives detection dog team is\r\npresently serving in Afghanistan alongside the forces\r\nof the other countries, which are helping to restore\r\norder in that war-torn land.\r\nWe appreciate the noteworthy role of the United\r\nNations and its Security Council in the universal\r\ncampaign against terrorism. We fully recognize the\r\nimportance of preventive measures and further\r\nstandard-setting in this field. To date, not a single\r\ncrime that could be classified as terrorism has been\r\ncommitted in Estonia. However, let me assure you that\r\nEstonia will continue to make all efforts necessary to\r\nfulfil its role in this ongoing quest for comprehensive\r\ninternational security.\r\nIndeed, I can announce for the record that Estonia\r\nhas ratified all the relevant United Nations conventions\r\nand has promptly presented reports to the appropriate\r\nparties about the implementation of the various\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nWe are confident that truly joint efforts, which\r\nmake use of the input of all States, will eventually\r\nenable the international community to make\r\nremarkable progress in the global struggle against\r\nterrorism. In this regard, cooperation to counter the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is of\r\nparticular significance, since sooner or later, terrorists\r\nmight actually gain access to these ghastly tools of\r\ndoom.\r\nToday, the United Nations faces the challenge of\r\nupholding its authority. For the sake of our future, and\r\nthe prestige and relevancy of the United Nations, it is\r\nessential that the United Nations does not shy away\r\nfrom reacting effectively and decisively when\r\nconfronted with real and formidable dangers. Full and\r\nunconditional implementation of Security Council\r\nresolutions is obligatory for all Members, just as is the\r\neffective enforcement of these resolutions.\r\nTherefore, we value highly the decisiveness of\r\nthe international community to implement the\r\nresolutions dealing with Iraq. Estonia supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s further efforts to obtain Iraq’s\r\ncompliance with the Security Council resolutions. The\r\nreturn of the United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq\r\nis just a beginning. Further acts will have to follow.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe possible results of international\r\nindecisiveness and appeasement are well illustrated by\r\nthe history of the League of Nations, which\r\ndisappeared from the international arena, just as did\r\nsome of its member States, including my homeland,\r\nEstonia. The result was an international conflagration\r\nthat left a large part of the civilized world in ruins, the\r\nvery ruins upon which the United Nations Organization\r\nwas founded. This taught us all a very essential\r\nlesson — inaction can often be much more disastrous\r\nthan action.\r\nAnother important issue which deserves to be\r\ntouched upon here is human trafficking, in particular\r\ntrafficking in women. The Estonian Government\r\nrecently acceded to the three Protocols additional to the\r\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime, including the Protocol to Prevent,\r\nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially\r\nWomen and Children. In June 2001, at the Women and\r\nDemocracy Conference in Lithuania, the Nordic and\r\nBaltic Ministers for Gender Equality decided to launch\r\na joint Nordic-Baltic information campaign against\r\ntrafficking in women.\r\nThe aim of the campaign, which will continue at\r\nleast until the beginning of 2003, is to turn the general\r\npublic’s attention to the problems of prostitution and\r\ntrafficking in people and to initiate public discussion\r\nabout the problems surrounding the issue of trafficking\r\nin women. The joint campaign is being carried out\r\nsimultaneously in the eight Nordic and Baltic\r\ncountries, with all relevant institutions concentrating,\r\nthroughout this year, on the matter of how best to\r\ncombat this problem. We hope that we will soon have\r\nsome concrete proposals for drafting amendments to\r\nappropriate national legislation.\r\nThe problem of trafficking in women, however, is\r\npart of a broader series of issues relating to women,\r\nincluding their position in society, their participation in\r\nthe decision-making process and so on. In order to\r\ndiscuss all of these topics in depth and to highlight\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nwomen’s role in democratic societies, Estonia will\r\nhost, in February 2003, a major international\r\nconference on women and democracy. I sincerely hope\r\nthat that conference will help to further the cause of\r\nwomen’s rights.\r\nAnother crucial issue on the global agenda, and\r\nthe last topic that I wish to speak about, is development\r\ncooperation and sustainable development. Having\r\nparticipated in the Monterrey discussions, and in the\r\nwake of the Johannesburg Conference, I would like to\r\nemphasize that the most important factor for sustained\r\nand sustainable development is a clear national goal\r\nand a road map for achieving it. Estonia is in the\r\nprocess of drafting a special sustainable development\r\nstrategy, a process involving the cooperation of both\r\ncivil society and the private sector.\r\nEstonia acknowledges the problem of\r\nenvironmental deterioration, and we have taken action\r\nto tackle it. Estonia has ratified the Kyoto Protocol —\r\namong many other international and regional\r\nagreements concerning the environment — and we will\r\ndo our best to fully implement the decisions made in\r\nJohannesburg.\r\nSince the successful implementation of recent\r\ninternational decisions depends largely on the\r\nconcerted action of the various parties, communication\r\nand access to information are becoming key issues.\r\nBridging the digital divide between the haves and the\r\nhave-nots is essential if we want all countries to benefit\r\nequally from globalization. Thanks to our rapid rate of\r\nprogress, Estonia has been able to support development\r\nin various other countries.\r\nThe creation of an e-governance academy in\r\nEstonia — a cooperative effort involving the Estonian\r\nGovernment, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme and the Open Society Institute — is a\r\nsignificant step towards bridging the digital gap with\r\nthe countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The\r\nacademy will also be open to other interested regions.\r\nThe academy will draw on the experiences gained in\r\nvarious environments, thereby providing broad\r\nknowledge that will enable participants to choose or\r\ncreate the best solution for their particular situation.\r\nAmong other things, this project demonstrates the\r\nsynergy that can be created from cooperation between\r\nGovernments, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nToday I have spoken about some of the issues on\r\nthe global agenda, all of which have been discussed at\r\nlength at recent international meetings and\r\nconferences. Those discussions provided us with useful\r\nsignposts, agreements and decisions. Now it is time to\r\nimplement them.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): I have the honour, on behalf of my country,\r\nthe United Arab Emirates, to extend to you, Sir, and to\r\nyour friendly country, the Czech Republic, our\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. We\r\nare confident that your great skill and diplomatic\r\nexperience in international affairs will assist you in\r\nachieving the goals of this session. We wish you and\r\nthe members of the Bureau great success.\r\nI also would like to thank your predecessor,\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo, for his effective leadership during\r\nthe previous session.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome\r\nand congratulate the Swiss Confederation on becoming\r\na Member of the United Nations. We also look forward\r\nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste soon\r\njoining the Organization, which will enhance its\r\nuniversality.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his wise\r\nleadership and his tireless efforts to enhance the role of\r\nthe United Nations in maintaining peace, security and\r\nstability in the world.\r\nThe States of the world are gathered here today at\r\nthe beginning of a new session of the General\r\nAssembly, hopeful of reaching more effective and\r\ntransparent solutions to the world’s problems, based on\r\nfairness and justice, and of establishing peace in the\r\nworld, which is experiencing instability and an\r\nimbalance in international relations.\r\nIn addition to civil and regional wars, more than\r\nhalf of the world’s population is suffering from\r\npoverty, famine, epidemics and fatal diseases. Some\r\ncountries are still occupying the territory of others.\r\nThis is creating tension and instability in many regions\r\nof the world, which is endangering regional and\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nAs the international community faces an\r\nincreasing number of challenges, we are becoming\r\nmore aware of the importance of complying with the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of\r\nrespecting the sovereignty of international law in\r\nresolving, by peaceful means, disputes, conflict and\r\ninstances of occupation.\r\nIn this age of globalization and rapid\r\ndevelopment in information and communication\r\ntechnologies, the world has become a small village that\r\ncan be reached from anywhere. The different interests\r\nof the world’s nations have become intertwined more\r\nthan ever. Thus the problems and sufferings of other\r\npeoples cannot be ignored because of geographical\r\ndistances or differences of culture, civilization and\r\nbeliefs.\r\nThe current events in the world prove, without a\r\ndoubt, that the outcomes of conflicts and wars and the\r\nproblems of poverty, drug abuse and disease extend\r\nbeyond their geographical borders, reaching secure\r\nregions and threatening their stability. For that reason,\r\nthe establishment of international peace and security in\r\nthe world is the joint responsibility of all Governments\r\nand nations, of their public as well as private\r\ninstitutions. The dire need for a global partnership,\r\nworking under the umbrella of the United Nations with\r\na view to creating a comprehensive and calculated\r\nstrategy that takes into consideration international law,\r\nhuman and cultural values and people’s needs and\r\nsuffering can never be overestimated.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is well aware of the\r\nstrategic importance of the Arabian Gulf region, and it\r\nis aware that the security of the Arabian Gulf cannot be\r\nseparated from international peace and security.\r\nFurthermore, the United Arab Emirates, guided by the\r\nwise leadership of His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin\r\nSultan A1-Nahyan, the President of the country,\r\nbelieves in solving disputes by peaceful means, based\r\non the principles of the United Nations Charter and the\r\nprovisions of international law. On that basis, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates calls upon the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran to solve the issue of its occupation of the three\r\nislands, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Moussa,\r\nthrough bilateral talks or through the International\r\nCourt of Justice. We also reaffirm that the United Arab\r\nEmirates has complete sovereignty over these three\r\nislands, including their air space, their regional waters,\r\nthe continental shelf and the economic region related to\r\nthem, as they are an indivisible part of the United Arab\r\nEmirates.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has more than once\r\nshown good will and a serious desire to reach a\r\npeaceful solution to the issue of the three islands. This\r\nwas done through two visits by his Highness, Sheikh\r\nHamdan bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, representing the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, to Tehran, in addition to\r\nmutual visits made by the two parties. The United Arab\r\nEmirates hopes that those visits will contribute to\r\nbringing both parties closer and to reaching a peaceful\r\nsolution for the three islands. This will reinforce the\r\nprinciple of security and of regional and international\r\npeace. In addition, it will affirm the principle of\r\ndialogue, peaceful coexistence, trust and good\r\nneighbourliness.\r\nWe have witnessed, during this session, new and\r\nencouraging developments regarding the Iraqi issue\r\nand the security and stability of the region. The United\r\nArab Emirates welcomes Iraq’s acceptance of the\r\nreturn of the United Nations inspectors, in\r\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions. This decision will spare Iraq and the region\r\nuntold tragedies and catastrophes. We look forward to\r\nreal cooperation, one built on the United Nations\r\nCharter and international resolutions, in order to reach\r\nstability and cooperation among the States of the\r\nregion and to resolve all remaining problems that\r\nhinder trust, stability and collaboration among the\r\ndifferent parties. We call upon the international\r\ncommunity to support the Iraqi decision, to exert\r\ngreater efforts to solve the pending issues between Iraq\r\nand the United Nations, and to lift the sanctions\r\nimposed on the Iraqi people and under which they have\r\nsuffered for 12 years. We welcome, furthermore, the\r\npositive attitude expressed by Iraq towards returning\r\nthe Kuwaiti national archives and properties. We urge\r\nit to show more goodwill and take more effective steps\r\nby freeing the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and those of\r\nthird countries, returning the rest of the Kuwaiti\r\nproperties, respecting the sovereignty of Kuwait and\r\nnot interfering in Kuwait’s internal affairs.\r\nWe also reiterate the United Arab Emirates’\r\nposition with regard to the resolution adopted by the\r\nArab Summit in Beirut in March 2002. This resolution\r\nrejects the use of force or the threat to use it, along\r\nwith any military attack against Iraq. This position\r\naims to protect the region from another unnecessary\r\nwar. We reiterate, furthermore, the importance of\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nsecuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nIraq.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is very concerned\r\nabout the dangerous events in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories. We express our sympathy and solidarity\r\nwith the Palestinian people in their ordeal. We also\r\ndenounce all acts of aggression committed by the\r\noccupying Israeli forces, and we demand that the\r\ninternational community, in particular the large\r\ninfluential countries, the United States of America and\r\nthe European Union, compel Israel to end immediately\r\nall acts of murder, destruction, closure and\r\ndisplacement of the Palestinian people.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates renews its support of\r\nthe right of the Palestinians to self-determination and\r\nthe establishment of their independent State, with\r\nJerusalem as its capital. Accordingly, we reaffirm our\r\nsupport of the Arab peace initiative that was endorsed\r\nat the Beirut Summit. This initiative comprises a\r\nprocess for a just and comprehensive settlement that\r\nensures the rights of both parties. Such a position was\r\nexpressed by United States President George W. Bush\r\nin a speech calling for the creation of a Palestinian\r\nState.\r\nWe also call upon Israel to end its continuous\r\nviolations of the agreements it made within the\r\nframework of the peace process and to resume peace\r\ntalks in accordance with General Assembly and\r\nSecurity Council resolutions, in particular resolutions\r\n181 (1947), 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002), and\r\n425 (1978). These call for Israel’s withdrawal from the\r\nPalestinian occupied lands, including the city of\r\nJerusalem, to the 1967 borders, from the Syrian Golan\r\nHeights to the line set before 4 June 1967 and from the\r\nLebanese Shabaa farms, and for the dismantling of all\r\nsettlements in occupied Palestinian and Arab lands and\r\nfor the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland.\r\nMaintaining peace and security in the Middle\r\nEast and the Arabian Gulf region depends, to a great\r\nextent, on applying a more comprehensive and\r\ntransparent concept that entails the removal of weapons\r\nof mass destruction. The fact that Israel has these\r\nweapons, including nuclear weapons, is a direct threat\r\nto regional and international security. Accordingly, we\r\nagain urge the international community and relevant\r\ninternational organizations to pressure Israel, by all\r\nmeans possible, to abandon its nuclear weapons and to\r\nsubject its nuclear facilities to the supervision of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. This proposal\r\naims to establish a nuclear-free zone, along with a zone\r\nthat is free of weapons of mass destruction, in the\r\nMiddle East and the Arabian Gulf, similar to other\r\nregions in the world.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates watches with great\r\nconcern the escalation in tensions between India and\r\nPakistan. We call upon these two countries to deal with\r\ntheir disputes in a spirit of joint political responsibility\r\nthat ensures the security of the region and the world.\r\nWe ask them to resume bilateral negotiations to resolve\r\ntheir standing disputes peacefully in order to maintain\r\nregional and international peace and security.\r\nInternational terrorism is a direct threat to the stability\r\nof nations and to international peace and the world\r\neconomy. In denouncing all acts of terrorism,\r\nregardless of their motives and sources, the United\r\nArab Emirates reaffirms its commitment to relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions on terrorism. It renews its\r\ncall for an international conference on terrorism to\r\nreach a clear definition of terrorism based on the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nregional and international treaties, conventions and\r\ncovenants.\r\nPolitical and historical events have proven that\r\neconomic deterioration, poverty, lack of water, debts\r\nand foreign occupation pose dangerous threats to life\r\nresources and the security of human beings. They are a\r\nmain cause of conflicts, violence, ethnic cleansing and\r\ninstability. On that basis, the leaders of the world\r\ninsisted, in the Plan of Implementation and the Political\r\nDeclaration of the Johannesburg World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, on the common and\r\ndifferentiated responsibility to solve these problems\r\nand on the importance of providing the financial\r\nresources to achieve the goals of economic, social and\r\nenvironmental development to eradicate poverty, raise\r\nstandards of living and achieve global economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates calls on the\r\nGovernments of the developed countries to honour the\r\ncommitments they made in Johannesburg — especially\r\nwith respect to the developing and least developed\r\ncountries, as specified in the recommendations\r\nemanating from the Summit — and in particular the\r\nfinancial resolutions requiring the developed countries\r\nto contribute 0.7 per cent of their national production\r\nto help poor, developing States to implement\r\ndevelopment programmes in their countries.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nWe call upon Governments and relevant\r\norganizations to comply with resolutions relevant to\r\nsustainable development. The United Arab Emirates\r\nhas consistently initiated and provided development,\r\nfinancial and humanitarian assistance to many\r\ncountries, especially developing countries, that suffer\r\nfrom civil and regional wars and natural disasters. We\r\nalso call upon the international financial institutions to\r\nadopt more balanced and fair financial policies to\r\nalleviate the developing countries’ external debt\r\nburden. This would give them the opportunity to\r\nparticipate in formulating decision-making policies\r\nrelevant to the environment and sustainable\r\ndevelopment and to help them join the global market,\r\nthus reviving and enhancing their national economies.\r\nThey would thereby become productive members of\r\nthe international community, effectively promoting the\r\nstability of international economic relations.\r\nFinally, we hope that the debates on the items on\r\nthe agenda of this session will achieve positive and\r\nconcrete results, enhancing the role of the Organization\r\nin maintaining international peace and security and\r\nmaking the world a better place for human society.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nGambia, His Excellency Mr. Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila\r\nJagne.\r\nMr. Jagne (Gambia): Let me first congratulate\r\nMr. Kavan on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and for the\r\nexcellent manner in which he has been presiding over\r\nour deliberations since the beginning of the session.\r\nWith the calibre of leadership he has displayed, added\r\nto his vast experience and wisdom, I have no doubt that\r\nour deliberations will be easily guided to a successful\r\noutcome.\r\nLet me also express my delegation’s thanks and\r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for\r\nhis efficiency and effectiveness in conducting the\r\nbusiness of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not pay homage to our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for another year of\r\nfine stewardship of our Organization and of humanity\r\nat large. Thanks to his leadership, our Organization has\r\nbeen able to cross a number of important frontiers in\r\nthe year since we last met.\r\nLastly, my delegation warmly congratulates East\r\nTimor on its full transition to democracy, its successful\r\nconduct of democratic elections, its recent accession to\r\nindependence and its subsequent admission into our\r\nUnited Nations family. Our congratulations also go to\r\nthe Government and people of Switzerland on acceding\r\nto full membership of the United Nations as the 190th\r\nand newest Member State.\r\nOur session is being convened at a time when the\r\nanniversary of the dastardly 11 September attack on the\r\nUnited States is being observed. We join the rest of the\r\nworld, including the families of the victims, in\r\nremembering those who lost their lives and we pray\r\nthat almighty God grant them eternal rest. Gambians\r\nwere among the thousands from many nations of the\r\nworld who were victims of the attack. This only goes to\r\nshow that terrorism knows no national boundaries. In\r\ncommemorating 11 September, President Jammeh\r\ndeclared a public holiday for people to stay home and\r\npray. We must therefore harness all our efforts and\r\ncooperate effectively to address this wicked\r\nphenomenon and its root causes.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to commend the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) for the good\r\nwork that it is doing in enhancing cooperation in the\r\nfield of counter-terrorism. In the course of this year,\r\nthe Gambia was able to accede to all the major treaties\r\nrelating to terrorism and we are currently in the process\r\nof implementing resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nThe year 2002 has been a busy one for us all.\r\nFirst, we came here for the special session on children.\r\nThen, we went off to Monterrey for the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, and we just\r\nrecently concluded our deliberations on sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Johannesburg, South Africa. At each of\r\nthese important forums, we were offered the\r\nopportunity of rededicating ourselves to the noble\r\nobjectives of our Organization, especially those that\r\nwere so strongly evinced at the Millennium Summit\r\nand enshrined in the millennium development goals,\r\nwhich we all espoused.\r\nThrough our deliberations at these meetings in\r\nthe course of this year, we have recommitted ourselves\r\nto striving in a more purposeful and determined manner\r\nto spread and deepen democracy throughout the world;\r\ndo better in protecting human rights, fundamental\r\nhuman freedoms and the rule of law; strengthen our\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\ncooperation in the fight against hunger, poverty and\r\ndisease; do more to protect the weak and vulnerable in\r\nour respective societies, particularly children, the aged\r\nand the handicapped; and redouble our efforts to\r\nsanitize and preserve the physical and human ecology\r\nand environment. These are some of the important\r\npillars on which world peace and security are built and\r\nwhich we must consciously work to strengthen and\r\npreserve from crumbling. That is the only sure way that\r\nglobal security and development, which are at the core\r\nof our Organization’s mandate, can be assured.\r\nWe in the Gambia have been doing all we can to\r\nstay the course in the uphill task of nation-building\r\nunder the inspired and dynamic leadership of President\r\nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh. In the area of good\r\ngovernance, I am pleased to inform this body that, with\r\nspecial reference to the democratization process,\r\nfollowing the much-acclaimed presidential elections\r\nheld last October, National Assembly elections were\r\nheld on 17 January and local Government elections on\r\n25 April 2002. Mindful of the need to cultivate the\r\nculture of democracy and good governance, the\r\nGovernment of the Gambia has since developed and\r\nadopted a national governance policy and programme.\r\nThe main components of the policy framework\r\nare constitutional review and reform of electoral\r\nprocesses; enhancing parliamentary structures and\r\nprocesses; civic education; reform of legal and judicial\r\nprocesses and constitutional review; public sector\r\nmanagement and administrative reform; and\r\ndecentralization and reform of local Government\r\nsystems. Clearly, governance constitutes an important\r\ncomponent of our poverty reduction strategy.\r\nHalfway through the United Nations Decade for\r\nthe Eradication of Poverty, and in spite of all the\r\ncommitments we have made over the years to reduce\r\npoverty and to accelerate the pace of social and\r\neconomic development throughout the world, the gap\r\nbetween the rich and the poor is widening and the\r\nabsolute number of poor people, especially in the\r\ndeveloping world, is increasing. The scourge of\r\npoverty is insidious. It contains within itself all the\r\nelements that militate against its victim’s ability to rise\r\nabove his or her condition.\r\nTherefore, fighting poverty calls for conscious,\r\ndeliberate interventions that only the strong can\r\nprovide to help the weak. These interventions come,\r\nfor the most part, in the form of resource flows.\r\nUnfortunately, these have been dwindling over the\r\nyears and, in spite of the recent commitments made by\r\nthe G8 countries in Kananaskis in support of the new\r\nAfrican initiative — the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), for which we are grateful —\r\noverall, the shortfalls in the fight against poverty are\r\nstill huge and growing.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe international community should not lead\r\nAfrican countries to disenchantment. The Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is, for the most\r\npart, still good only on paper, largely speaking.\r\nProtectionist policies and heavy subsidies continue to\r\nfrustrate our efforts to earn a decent living through\r\nproduction and trade. And the promises of increased\r\nofficial development assistance and other forms of\r\nassistance over four United Nations Development\r\nDecades have remained largely unfulfilled. In fact, this\r\nsession of the General Assembly will look into the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, and the main\r\nconclusion will be that, by and large, the commitments\r\nmade by Africa’s development partners have not been\r\nmet. We missed another opportunity for the multilateral\r\nsystem to work towards poverty eradication and social\r\nand economic development.\r\nWith special reference to the plight of least\r\ndeveloped countries, I would like to add the Gambia’s\r\nvoice to those of previous speakers in calling for a\r\nrenewed commitment to implementing the programme\r\nof action for the least developed countries for the\r\ndecade 2001-2010. In that connection, we commend\r\nthe General Assembly for the decision taken to\r\nestablish the Office of the High Representative for the\r\nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing\r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States. We look\r\nforward to working closely with the High\r\nRepresentative.\r\nThe recently held ministerial meeting of least\r\ndeveloped countries in Cotonou was indeed timely, and\r\nwe call on the rest of the international community to\r\nlend its full support to the least developed countries so\r\nthat we implement fully the decisions taken. We\r\ncannot, however, discuss the issue of poverty\r\nalleviation without mentioning the problem of women\r\nand children. With regard to our women folk, we need\r\nto focus more on the 12 critical areas of concern laid\r\nout in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nincluding gender inequalities. As for the issues\r\nconcerning children, we hope that the follow-up\r\nsummit held here in New York recently will strengthen\r\nus in our resolve to achieve the noble goals that we\r\nhave set for ourselves to give our children a brighter\r\nfuture.\r\nFor our part, in the Gambia we have evolved a\r\nstrong and focused policy on poverty, which we have\r\narticulated in a programme of action for poverty\r\nalleviation. The strategy is anchored on my\r\nGovernment’s commitment to eradicate poverty in the\r\nlong term, by increasing income through economic\r\ngrowth and empowering the population with the\r\ncapacity for sustainable development. Our fight against\r\npoverty stands on five pillars: the creation of an\r\nenabling environment for economic growth and\r\ndevelopment, enhancing the productive capacity and\r\nsocial protection of the poor, improving coverage of\r\nbasic services, political empowerment of civil society,\r\nand strengthened partnerships with development\r\nstakeholders. My Government is committed to\r\nrelentlessly pursuing those objectives in line with the\r\nobjectives of the Millennium Development Goals. In\r\nthat, we shall be counting on the wholehearted support\r\nof the international community.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to express my\r\nGovernment’s most profound gratitude to our principal\r\npartners in development and to the donor community at\r\nlarge for their active participation at the sixth\r\nRoundtable Donors Conference for the Gambia, held in\r\nGeneva on 18 and 19 September 2002. We are\r\nconfident that all the pledges made will be honoured so\r\nthat together, in the true spirit of international\r\nsolidarity, we will implement smoothly and\r\nsuccessfully our national programme of action for\r\npoverty alleviation.\r\nThat is all the more urgent considering the fact\r\nthat, during the rainy season this year, we experienced\r\na long dry spell initially, resulting in the poor\r\nperformance of both crops and livestock.\r\nIt is our hope that all nations of the world will\r\nredouble their efforts to live up to the commitments\r\nthey made in Rio and, just recently, reaffirmed in\r\nJohannesburg. Even as we search for ways of taking\r\nour people out of poverty, we should also be mindful of\r\nthe need to conserve our natural environment.\r\nOf particular concern to my delegation are the\r\ndestructive fishing practices in the South Atlantic.\r\nDespite the adoption of numerous international\r\ninstruments to regulate fishing with a view to\r\nconserving fish stocks, unsustainable and often illegal\r\nfishing continues unabated in our coastal waters. The\r\nunbridled pursuit of profit without due regard to\r\nsustainability and long-term food security is the only\r\nreason for that undesirable situation. My delegation\r\ntherefore calls on all Member States to cooperate with\r\nus to address this serious state of affairs and to provide\r\nus with technical and other forms of assistance to\r\nenable all affected countries to better police their\r\nwaters in order to arrest those unsustainable and\r\nharmful fishing practices.\r\nThe momentum generated in Johannesburg must\r\nnot be allowed to wither away. It must be recognized,\r\nhowever, that there can be no meaningful development\r\nwithout peace and stability. That is why we attach great\r\nimportance to the issue of peacekeeping.\r\nIn the field of peacekeeping, our Organization\r\ncontinues to score remarkable successes. We appreciate\r\nthe efforts of the Security Council to put in place a\r\nrapid response mechanism through which a\r\nmultinational force could quickly be deployed to any\r\npart of the world. However, there is need to ensure that\r\nadequate resources are made available so that no\r\npeacekeeping operation is disrupted on account of lack\r\nof funds, thereby plunging the countries concerned\r\nback into a vortex of violence. Funding availability is\r\nalso important to bridge the gap between peacekeeping\r\nand national reconstruction.\r\nThe determination with which we have dealt with\r\nthreats to peace has paid handsome dividends in the\r\nperiod since we last met. That is why we welcome the\r\ngreat efforts made to distinguish the existing conflicts\r\nin Africa, especially in Sierra Leone, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Angola.\r\nWith regard to the Sudan, my Government\r\napplauds the signing of the Machacos Protocol between\r\nthe Government and the Sudanese People’s Liberation\r\nArmy (SPLA). We hope and pray that the process now\r\nstarted will finally bring that protracted conflict to an\r\nend.\r\nWhile we may rightly commend ourselves on\r\nthose achievements, we must not rest on our oars.\r\nThere are still some significant areas of uncertainty and\r\nvolatility in our own West African subregion that we\r\nneed to address. That requires a relentless effort.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nIn our capacity as coordinator of the Group of\r\nfriends of Guinea-Bissau, here at the United Nations,\r\nwe are calling on the rest of the international\r\ncommunity to provide more assistance to that sister\r\ncountry. In that way, the democratization process will\r\nbe consolidated and the country’s economic\r\nperformance enhanced.\r\nWe must bear in mind that ending hostilities is\r\none thing and getting the system on the right path to\r\nsocial and economic development of the type that\r\nwould eliminate the causes of conflict is quite another.\r\nIn like manner, a successful transition into a\r\ndemocratic dispensation does not necessarily, in and of\r\nitself, usher in peace and security. In many of the\r\ncountries where conflicts have ended, political stability\r\nremains fragile, and uncertainty and instability prevail.\r\nIn those countries, there is need to go beyond the\r\nimmediate political requirements for consolidating\r\npeace, to address governance in its broadest sense,\r\nincluding its economic and financial aspects, as well as\r\nthe capacities required for strengthening it. That is the\r\nemerging challenge for the international community.\r\nWe must devise mechanisms for follow-through into\r\npeace-building and be ready to provide the resources to\r\nprogressively restore confidence and strength among\r\nthose at the frontline.\r\nPresident Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, the Government\r\nand people of the Gambia are fully committed to the\r\nsearch for peace and the resolution of conflicts\r\neverywhere, particularly in our immediate subregion.\r\nThat is why we not only open our doors to our\r\nneighbours in distress, hosting many refugees, but we\r\nalso work actively with them as well as with other\r\nmembers of the international community, including the\r\nSecretary-General and his able team to remove\r\nmisunderstandings that could easily lead to a flare up\r\nof conflict.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains a matter\r\nof grave concern to my delegation. The Security\r\nCouncil must show more leadership in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to contain and resolve the\r\nserious tensions between Israel and Palestine, which\r\npose a grave threat to the stability of the nations in the\r\nregion and the peace of the whole world. It is\r\nunacceptable for the world to stand back and watch as\r\nhelpless civilians are attacked in refugee camps or are\r\nkilled or maimed by suicide bombers. The suffering of\r\ninnocent people in the Middle East must be brought to\r\nan end immediately.\r\nMy delegation strongly urges, therefore, that all\r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions on Palestine\r\nand the Middle East, notably Security Council\r\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), be complied\r\nwith without further delay. We also fully support those\r\nwho have called for the recognition of the State of\r\nIsrael by all nations, as well as the creation and the\r\nrecognition by all of a State of Palestine.\r\nElsewhere in the Middle East, there are still some\r\nunresolved issues. The situation between Iraq and\r\nKuwait has still not been fully resolved, and we are\r\nstill seeking a satisfactory resolution of the question of\r\nthe Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons, as\r\nwell as the return of the Kuwaiti national archives.\r\nWithin Iraq itself, we in the Gambia have always\r\ncalled for the alleviation of the suffering of the\r\ninnocent Iraqi people. With regard to the other\r\nunfinished business of weapons inspections, my\r\ndelegation applauds the decision of the Government of\r\nIraq to invite the United Nations weapons inspectors to\r\nreturn to Iraq to resume their work. We have always\r\nupheld the view that parties to any dispute should\r\nallow the United Nations to assume its responsibility\r\nunhindered in our common quest for amicable closure\r\nto conflict situations. We therefore note with\r\nsatisfaction the important statement made by President\r\nBush recognizing the central role of the United Nations\r\nand calling on the latter to assume its responsibility.\r\nBut let us also remember that we, all of us — nations\r\nbig and small, rich and poor — constitute the United\r\nNations. It can be only what we the Member States\r\nwant it to be. The choice is ours.\r\nIn South Asia, we cannot be indifferent to the\r\nprevailing situation between India and Pakistan. Those\r\nare two great countries with which the Gambia has\r\nalways enjoyed excellent relations. We are therefore\r\ncalling on them, out of that friendship, to exercise\r\nrestraint at all times and to withdraw their troops from\r\ntheir respective borders.\r\nAfter years of hard work and tough negotiations,\r\nwe finally succeeded in establishing the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC), with the entry into force of the\r\nRome Statute. We salute the tireless efforts of all those\r\nwho contributed in one way or another to that huge\r\nsuccess. It is our fervent hope that the Court, with the\r\nactive collaboration of all like-minded States, will act\r\nas an effective instrument in the fight against\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\ninternational crimes of all sorts and, by extension,\r\nextinguish the culture of impunity.\r\nTurning now to the issue of sanctions, my\r\ndelegation firmly believes that the time has now come\r\nfor us to review the procedure being used to impose\r\nsanctions on countries and individuals. The permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council, who determine who\r\nshould be placed on a sanctions or travel ban list, do\r\nnot usually provide evidence, either to the individual\r\nconcerned or to his Government, to justify their\r\ndecision. We have come to see that in many cases, such\r\ndecisions are based on speculation and conjecture and\r\nthat the individuals in question really did not deserve to\r\nbe punished and humiliated. Thus far, most\r\nGovernments have been very cooperative and, while\r\nrepeatedly requesting to no avail that evidence of\r\nwrong-doing be made known to them, have nonetheless\r\ngone along with the rest of the international community\r\nin respecting the decision taken by the Council. Some\r\nof those Governments, mine included, are reaching the\r\npoint of exasperation and have resolved that, unless the\r\nevidence being requested of the Security Council is\r\nprovided, they will refuse to comply with any ban or\r\nsanctions imposed on their nationals. We sometimes\r\nwonder whether someone out there does not have a\r\nhidden agenda. As sovereign nations, we demand more\r\ntransparency before acquiescing to our nationals being\r\npunished for wrongdoings that we have not been shown\r\nthey have committed. The United Nations Security\r\nCouncil must not be a bully.\r\nIn like manner, the multifaceted sanctions\r\nimposed on Cuba are still in place despite numerous\r\nresolutions calling for their removal. A window of\r\nopportunity now exists for them to be finally set aside.\r\nIt is in nobody’s interest to continue to pursue policies\r\nagainst Cuba that have lost their appeal.\r\nSabres are rattling on one side of the Taiwan\r\nStrait in the face of 23 million souls, for their merely\r\nhaving claimed their God-given right to be recognized\r\nas a political, economic and social entity. The Republic\r\nof China on Taiwan is today the only country on earth\r\nthat is not represented in the United Nations, contrary\r\nto the main guiding principle of the United Nations: the\r\nprinciple of universality. Article four of the Charter\r\ninvites “all ... peace-loving States” to become Members\r\nof the Organization. The people of Taiwan have\r\ndemonstrated over the years not only that they are\r\npeace-loving but also that they can contribute to all the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations in the fields of global\r\nsecurity, financial stability, culture, industrial and\r\ntechnological growth and sustainable development.\r\nTaiwan is not an insignificant player in the world\r\nproduction and trade arena. It is the world’s sixteenth\r\nlargest economy. It is equally highly developed in the\r\nfield of scientific and medical research.\r\nIn recognition of its importance as a trading\r\nnation, it was recently admitted into the World Trade\r\nOrganization. Logic demands that, for the very same\r\nreason, it should also be admitted into the World\r\nHealth Organization in recognition of its importance as\r\na country of highly sophisticated and developed health\r\nservices; into the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization because of its\r\nexceptionally high standing in the fields of science and\r\nculture; into the United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization because of its most\r\nadvanced industrial and technological development;\r\ninto the United Nations Children’s Fund because of its\r\nhighly developed child development policies and\r\nprogrammes; into the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization, the International Fund for Agricultural\r\nDevelopment and the World Food Programme because\r\nof its extremely well developed agriculture and its\r\nimportance as a food producer; and into the United\r\nNations Development Programme because of its huge\r\nofficial development assistance to developing countries\r\nfor capacity-building and poverty alleviation. In short,\r\nit should be admitted into all branches of the United\r\nNations family because of the tremendous\r\ncontributions it could make to the ideals and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations.\r\nTaiwan is a vibrant democracy with high ratings\r\non human rights, press freedom and the observance of\r\nthe rights of the individual. It could contribute\r\nimmensely to global security and the fight against\r\nterrorism. It is therefore baffling that this highly\r\ndeveloped, friendly and peace-loving nation has been\r\nbarred from membership in the United Nations for\r\npurely political reasons. My Government will not rest\r\nuntil this injustice is undone and the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan is granted its rightful place among the\r\ncomity of nations.\r\nStill in the same region, with regard to the Korean\r\nPeninsula, my delegation would like to reiterate once\r\nagain our unflinching support for all the efforts geared\r\ntowards peaceful unification.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nFinally, my delegation believes that the General\r\nAssembly needs to be strengthened so that it could play\r\nan even greater role in our quest for a just and\r\nequitable world order. We welcome the moves being\r\nmade to reform this important organ of the United\r\nNations in ways that would render it more effective in\r\ndischarging its mandate.\r\nThis is particularly true of the Security Council.\r\nWe in the Gambia will continue to add our voice to the\r\nclamour for the Security Council to be reformed in\r\norder to make it more democratic and more in tune\r\nwith the realities of and requirements for global\r\nsecurity in the twenty-first century. The credibility and\r\nrelevance of the Security Council now depend on the\r\nreforms that we all have been calling for. The\r\ndeveloping countries must be allowed a much more\r\neffective participation in this powerful organ of the\r\nUnited Nations. Africa should have a minimum of two\r\npermanent seats.\r\nIn conclusion, we urge all nations, great and\r\nsmall, to work relentlessly towards preserving the\r\nideals for which the Organization was set up. We\r\nshould all eschew behaviours that undermine the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations and that frustrate its\r\nefforts. Multilateralism is the only hope left to mankind\r\nfor the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Let us\r\ncherish and nurture it. Multilateralism will thrive only\r\nif there is trust and confidence among all the actors.\r\nBut a system that repeatedly frustrates and lets down\r\none portion of its membership will malfunction and\r\neventually become ineffective and irrelevant. We must\r\ntherefore all do more to ensure that such a fate does not\r\nbefall our Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to remind speakers of our time limit for\r\nstatements in the General Assembly, which is 15\r\nminutes.\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency Mr.\r\nAhmed Tahir Baduri, Chairman of the delegation of\r\nEritrea.\r\nMr. Baduri (Eritrea): Let me start by\r\ncongratulating the President on his unanimous election\r\nto preside  over the fifty-seventh session of the United\r\nNations General Assembly. His election is an honour to\r\nhim and to his country, the Czech Republic. The\r\ndelegation of the State of Eritrea assures you of its full\r\ncooperation and support.\r\nAllow me also to extend to his predecessor, Mr.\r\nHan Seung-soo of the Republic of Korea, my\r\ndelegation’s deep appreciation for a job well done\r\nduring the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\r\nProfound appreciation is also due to our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts to\r\nmake our United Nations more responsive and\r\neffective.\r\nOn this happy occasion, my delegation welcomes\r\nthe Swiss Confederation to the family of nations with\r\ngreat pleasure. We commend the decision taken by the\r\nSwiss people in allowing their great country to become\r\na full Member of the United Nations. The same words\r\ngo to the soon-to-be 191st Member of our\r\nOrganization, the Democratic Republic of East Timor,\r\na country whose sovereignty and independence has\r\nbeen won with sweat and blood, like that of my own\r\ncountry. Warm welcome from Eritrea, East Timor!\r\nThe fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly is taking place at a time when the wounds\r\nand scars from the 11 September terrorist attack one\r\nyear ago, in three locations over the soil of the United\r\nStates, are still healing. Grief, pain and anger are still\r\nlingering.\r\nAt a gathering here at Headquarters this 11\r\nSeptember to commemorate the first anniversary of the\r\nattack, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said,\r\n“On 11 September grief enveloped the\r\nworld, not only out of solidarity with the people\r\nof the United States, but out of shared loss. More\r\nthan 90 nations lost sons and daughters of their\r\nown — murdered that day for no other reason\r\nthan that they had chosen to live in this country.\r\nToday, we come together as a world community\r\nbecause we were attacked as a world\r\ncommunity.”\r\nThe loss of almost 3,000 innocent lives in a single\r\nday is so painful. The Eritrean people share the pain\r\nand the grief. They reiterate their condolences to those\r\nwho lost their loved ones, and they stand in solidarity\r\nwith the American people at this trying time. Indeed,\r\nthe attacks of 11 September have inevitably changed\r\nthe way we live and the way we see our world. This\r\nday has symbolized the alarm clock that rung around\r\nthe world to wake us all. My delegation regrets that it\r\ntook attacks of such magnitude to shake us from our\r\nunwatchful sleep.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nTerrorism is not a new phenomenon in my\r\ncountry. The State of Eritrea has suffered it since its\r\nformal independence, in 1993, as the youngest country\r\nin Africa. The Eritrean Islamic Jihad Movement and\r\nthe so-called Eritrean Popular Islamic Conference were\r\ncreated and sponsored by Al Qaeda and other regional\r\nand international Islamic groups to perpetrate\r\nsubversive acts in Eritrea for the last 10 years. In 1994,\r\nEritrean security forces intercepted a mixed group of\r\nterrorists that included in their ranks Al Qaeda-trained\r\nnationals from several countries. In 1995, this group\r\nmurdered four Belgian tourists inside Eritrea in cold\r\nblood. Sporadic cross-border acts of terror and\r\nsubversion continue to this day.\r\nIn a statement contained in document S/1997/517\r\nof 7 July 1997, my Government first warned the\r\ninternational community, and subsequently the then\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the Security\r\nCouncil, that international terrorist threats from\r\nextreme fundamentalist Islamic groups were on the\r\nway.\r\nThe Eritrean Jihad terrorist movements, which are\r\nmembers of the Al Qaeda network, are now part of the\r\nso-called Alliance of Eritrean National Forces. This\r\numbrella organization has bases and physical presences\r\nin some neighbouring, and a number of Western,\r\ncountries. These groups continue to obtain sanctuary,\r\nas well as financial and other forms of assistance, from\r\nWestern capitals.\r\nAs the fight against international terrorism\r\nassumes high priority and warrants concerted action,\r\nthe Government of Eritrea requests full cooperation\r\nand joint action from the countries where these terrorist\r\nelements live, plan and launch their operations. At this\r\njuncture, I also wish to reiterate to the Assembly that\r\nthe people and Government of Eritrea will continue to\r\nfight terrorism in all its forms.\r\nDespite the declaration by the 1999 Algiers\r\nSummit of the OAU to make the year 2000 the year to\r\nend conflicts and to start a new momentum for peace in\r\nAfrica, conflicts have continued to take a heavy toll on\r\nAfrican peoples in many countries of the continent.\r\nThis is indeed disappointing.\r\nI come from the Horn of Africa, a subregion\r\nwhere conflicts and wars have been a way of life for\r\nmany decades. The Horn of Africa is also a place that\r\nhas seen many misfortunes. Recurring conflicts over\r\npast decades have claimed hundreds of thousands of\r\nlives, displaced a staggering number of people and\r\nforced millions out of their countries to live as refugees\r\nin foreign lands.\r\nThe internal conflict in the Sudan is now the\r\nlongest running one in Africa. Under the framework of\r\nthe Inter-Governmental Authority on Development\r\n(IGAD), a subregional entity, the State of Eritrea,\r\ntogether with the other member countries, is doing its\r\nbest to bring about a resolution to this conflict. We\r\nhave come a long way in bringing the conflicting\r\nparties to face-to-face  talks. There are encouraging\r\nsigns, but we cannot congratulate ourselves yet. Our\r\nefforts may be considered a success once quieter days\r\nof peace, stability and sustained prosperity prevail in\r\nthat sisterly country. I must admit that we need the help\r\nof the international community to end the suffering of\r\nour brothers and sisters in the Sudan.\r\nIn the same vein, the problem in Somalia, another\r\nsisterly country in the Horn, continues to be a serious\r\none that the international community cannot ignore.\r\nThe vicious conflict in Somalia will have long-term\r\ncatastrophic humanitarian consequences if the\r\ninternational community abandons this unfortunate\r\ncountry. The United Nations and the world community\r\nat large must help the Transitional National\r\nGovernment of Somalia to stabilize peace and security\r\nin the country. The international community should\r\nrush to save Somalia.\r\nNow, on a positive note, let me tell the Assembly\r\nthe good news regarding the border conflict between\r\nmy country and Ethiopia. On 13 April this year, the\r\nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a panel of five\r\njudges established by the Algiers agreement, made a\r\njudicial ruling on the entire 1,000-kilometer border\r\nbetween the two countries. The people and\r\nGovernment of Eritrea are pleased to see a legal\r\nsolution to a conflict they never chose.\r\nMy Government believed from the very\r\nbeginning that this conflict could not be settled by\r\nmight, but by peaceful means alone. The pacifist A. J.\r\nMuste said it all: “There is no way to peace. Peace is\r\nthe way”.\r\nThe Boundary Commission has drawn the new\r\nborder and is currently in the process of physically\r\ndemarcating the lines on the ground. Completion of the\r\ndemarcation is expected in the next few months.\r\nAccording to the Algiers agreement, which both\r\ncountries signed, the decision of the Commission is\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nfinal and binding. Eritrea has reiterated its acceptance\r\nof the Commission’s decision of 13 April 2002. Eritrea\r\ntherefore believes that territorial claims and counter-\r\nclaims ended on that day. In legal terms, the conflict\r\nended then too.\r\nNow that the conflict has legally been put to rest,\r\nthe people of Eritrea want to leave this awful\r\nexperience behind them and move on with life afresh.\r\nAs Carl Bard said, “Though no one can go back and\r\nmake a brand new start, anyone can start from now and\r\nmake a brand new ending.” What matters is the\r\ndestination point. The people and Government of\r\nEritrea are committed to turning things around.\r\nAt the end of this saga, my delegation finds it\r\nfitting to pay tribute at the General Assembly to our\r\npeace-loving friends and partners who helped us to get\r\nhere. Allow me therefore to particularly thank the\r\nformer Organization of African Unity, now the African\r\nUnion; President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria; the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan; the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica; and the European Union. We are grateful to\r\nthem all for their valued efforts in this difficult and\r\nlong peace process.\r\nThe year 2002 saw five important international\r\ngatherings aimed at bringing peace, security, human\r\ndignity and economic prosperity to the peoples of the\r\nworld, big and small alike. Those meetings included\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in Monterrey, the Second World\r\nAssembly on Ageing in Madrid, the special session on\r\nchildren in New York, the World Food Summit in\r\nRome and, lastly, the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Johannesburg. The promises and\r\ndeclarations of all these international events are tied in\r\nwith the goals of the 2000 United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nAs we all know, those goals embrace the key\r\ndimensions of human development — related to\r\npoverty, hunger, education and health — stated as a set\r\nof time-bound targets. Those targets are: halving\r\npoverty and hunger, achieving universal primary\r\neducation and gender equality, reducing under-5\r\nmortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by three\r\nquarters, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and halving\r\nthe proportion of people who lack access to safe water.\r\nWith 1990 as the base year, those targets are to be\r\nachieved by 2015.\r\nDespite the promises of globalization and the\r\nmany initiatives launched at various times to help the\r\ncontinent, Africa’s economic growth is still lagging far\r\nbehind. The success of development in Africa still\r\ndepends on the political will of rich countries to\r\nprovide financial assistance, on the one hand, and on\r\nthe full ownership and effective execution of national\r\ndevelopment programmes by African countries\r\nthemselves, on the other.\r\nHaving said that, I shall now, for the benefit of\r\nour partners, reiterate the five core principles\r\nunderlying Eritrea’s development strategy: first,\r\ndeveloping the capabilities of our people as the\r\nprincipal asset and driving force of our development\r\nendeavours; secondly, establishing strong public-\r\nprivate sector partnerships; thirdly, striving to achieve\r\nself-reliance and avoiding chronic and debilitating\r\ndependency; fourthly, protecting the environment from\r\nthe adverse effects of development programmes; and\r\nfifthly, establishing effective development partnerships\r\nwith multilateral and bilateral development agencies,\r\nwith Governments and with non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nI would be remiss if I failed to bring to the\r\nattention of the Assembly the looming drought that\r\nthreatens the lives of more than 1 million men, women\r\nand children in Eritrea. The failure of vital rains\r\nexpected in the months of April and May has put their\r\nlives at risk. Famine is imminent if international aid\r\ndoes not reach the Eritrean people soon. I wish to use\r\nthis occasion, therefore, to appeal to the donor\r\ncommunity to respond to this pressing humanitarian\r\nneed.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my delegation’s\r\nconfidence that, under your able leadership, Mr.\r\nPresident, the fifty-seventh session will see much\r\nsuccess.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Ion Botnaru,\r\nChairman of the delegation of the Republic of\r\nMoldova.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Republic of Moldova): On behalf\r\nof the Government of the Republic of Moldova, I join\r\nother delegations in congratulating Mr. Jan Kavan on\r\nhis election as the President of the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly. I would also like to express\r\nmy sincere thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo, for the competent manner in which he managed\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nthis forum during the dramatic period of the previous\r\nsession.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nwelcome the Swiss Confederation as a Member of our\r\nfamily of nations. We look forward to welcoming East\r\nTimor as the 191st Member of the United Nations in\r\nthe near future.\r\nOne year after the terrible attacks of 11\r\nSeptember, we remember the innocent victims of those\r\ncrimes. As a result of that tragedy, the world changed\r\nfundamentally in many ways. The international\r\ncommunity agreed to start fighting terrorism in all its\r\nforms. The international anti-terrorism coalition, led by\r\nthe United States, succeeded in significantly\r\nundermining the capacity of the Al-Qaeda terrorist\r\norganization and in removing the Taliban regime,\r\nwhich had hosted it. The General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council took prompt action resulting in\r\nmandatory measures aimed at eliminating all forms and\r\nmanifestations of terrorism and requiring Member\r\nStates to take administrative, financial, legal and other\r\nsteps. The immediate, effective and, even more\r\nimportant, united action by the United Nations against\r\na terrorist threat that had now reached a new level\r\nshows the Organization’s continued importance and\r\nviability. Once more, we saw the capacity of the United\r\nNations to fulfil its noble mission by uniting and\r\nmobilizing us for this relentless fight.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova supports those actions\r\nand reaffirms its commitment to fighting terrorism in\r\nall its forms. My country has been taking concrete\r\naction towards the implementation of all relevant\r\nUnited Nations decisions, especially Security Council\r\nresolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390 (2002). First,\r\nconcrete steps have been taken to consolidate our\r\ndomestic anti-terrorist legislation. Moldova presented\r\ntwo relevant reports to the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee. Only months after those tragic events, our\r\nParliament adopted a law to combat terrorism and a\r\nlaw to prevent and combat money-laundering. Relevant\r\nmodifications were introduced to the Criminal Code.\r\nWith its recent accession to the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing\r\nand to the International Convention against the Taking\r\nof Hostages, as well as its ratification[n of the\r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\r\nFinancing of Terrorism, Moldova is about to conclude\r\nits process of acceding to the 12 main international\r\ninstruments related to combating terrorism. We call on\r\nall Member States to undertake new efforts to conclude\r\nthe United Nations Comprehensive Convention on\r\nInternational Terrorism.\r\nAt the same time, as a new independent State, we\r\nask for expert support in implementing some of those\r\ncomplex measures. Moldova has shown its political\r\nwill to combat terrorism by actively participating in\r\nnew efforts within the framework of many regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, including the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe; the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States; the Stability\r\nPact for South-East Europe; the South-East Europe\r\nCooperative Initiative; and the Georgia, Uzbekistan,\r\nUkraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova Group.\r\nThe stabilization and rehabilitation process in\r\nAfghanistan is a test for the Organization and for the\r\nrest of the international community. Considerable\r\nprogress has been achieved, and we must commend the\r\njob done by the anti-terrorism coalition under very\r\ndifficult conditions, the efforts of international donors\r\nand, above all, the efforts of the Afghanistan\r\nleadership, led by President Hamid Karzai. The Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for\r\nAfghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, has\r\nrepeatedly urged the international community to\r\nmaintain its strong and active support for the\r\nGovernment and people of Afghanistan. We share the\r\nview that stability for Afghanistan must be seen within\r\nthe context of a broader stabilization process that\r\nsecures increased support from international financial\r\norganizations for all Central Asian countries.\r\nUndoubtedly, there is an urgent need for more\r\nsubstantial efforts to bring an end to the Middle East\r\nconflict. This year has been marked by successive\r\nterrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and by Israel’s\r\ndisproportionate use of force against the Palestinians.\r\nWe support the efforts of the Quartet to restart the\r\npeace process on the basis of the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions in order to achieve the peaceful\r\ncoexistence of Israel and an independent Palestinian\r\nState within secure and internationally recognized\r\nborders.\r\nWe share the concern expressed by many\r\nprevious speakers on the situation concerning Iraq, and\r\nwe call on Baghdad to comply immediately and fully\r\nwith all relevant Security Council resolutions. In that\r\nregard, we welcome the statement made recently in this\r\nHall by President Bush recognizing the central role of\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nthe United Nations and calling on it to shoulder its\r\nresponsibility. Moldova, a country with an economy in\r\ntransition, attaches great importance to the United\r\nNations agenda for development and, in particular, the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development held in Monterrey this\r\nyear, the Doha Development Agenda and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg\r\nconstituted an essential step in the convergence of\r\ninternational efforts in such vital areas as the\r\neradication of poverty and the reversal of\r\nenvironmental and resource degradation.\r\nThe external debt burden, the lack of necessary\r\nresources, weak financial and banking systems,\r\nfrequent natural calamities and droughts are\r\nundermining many of the efforts made by our\r\nGovernments. Unfortunately, some recommendations\r\nimplemented at the request of and at the insistence of\r\nsome international financial institutions have proved to\r\nbe relatively, or even totally, ineffective. While they\r\naccept primary responsibility for the well-being of their\r\ncitizens, many Governments in the developing world\r\nare still waiting for promised resources.\r\nMy country welcomes the entry into force on 1\r\nJuly of this year of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), which inaugurated\r\na new era in the affirmation of fundamental human\r\nrights on the world stage. Moldova has begun\r\npreparations to join the ICC, which we believe will\r\nbecome an effective, competent and equitable legal\r\ninstrument.\r\nThe recent debates in the General Assembly on\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) demonstrate that the world strongly supports\r\nthe unprecedented integration processes taking place\r\non the African continent.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova welcomes the creation\r\nof the African Union. We share the view that the\r\nUnited Nations and the entire international community\r\nmust remain fully engaged in resolving the conflicts\r\nthat still prevail in many parts of Africa.\r\nConflict prevention is the central challenge facing\r\nour Organization. The Secretary-General called for the\r\nUnited Nations to move from a culture of reaction to a\r\nculture of prevention. Poverty, inequality and injustice\r\nare most frequently named as causes of conflicts.\r\nSeparatism is also one of the phenomena provoking\r\ninstability and conflicts in many parts of the world.\r\nWhile we are mentioning the improvement in the\r\nBalkan situation, there are still a number of so-called\r\nfrozen conflicts in the post-Soviet area, creating\r\ninstability in the entire region. Despite many years of\r\nnegotiations the separatist regime in Transdniestria\r\ncontinues blatantly to ignore any efforts made by the\r\nMoldovan Government, the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other\r\ncountries, to oppress the local population and violate\r\nelementary human rights. By creating new obstacles to\r\nthe process of removing ammunitions and weapons, the\r\nTransdniestrian separatist regime is putting at risk the\r\nfulfilment of the Istanbul OSCE Summit decision,\r\nwhich was reaffirmed by United Nations General\r\nAssembly resolution 55/179 concerning the withdrawal\r\nof all foreign forces and armaments from the territory\r\nof the Republic of Moldova by the end of this year.\r\nAnother reason for our deep concern is the\r\nexistence of a huge quantity of unregistered arms at the\r\ndisposal of paramilitary units. At industrial sites of the\r\nformer Soviet military complex in that region, the\r\nseparatist authorities produce different types of\r\nweapons, which are delivered through third countries\r\nto other areas of conflict, thus assisting terrorist and\r\ncriminal groups, as well as other separatist regimes.\r\nThe considerable changes that have occurred\r\nrecently in the international arena have highlighted the\r\noverwhelming role that the United Nations must play in\r\norder to consolidate democratic values and institutions\r\nand ensure peace and stability. My delegation fully\r\nsupports the efforts made by Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan toward reforming our Organization. Some steps\r\nhave been taken to revitalize the work of the General\r\nAssembly. The reform of the Security Council will\r\nmake it more equitable and consistent with the\r\nexpansion of the international community and will\r\nbetter reflect new realities. We support the expansion\r\nof permanent and non-permanent membership, so as to\r\nlet those Member States that are willing and able, to\r\nbetter contribute to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and stability.\r\nThe United Nations has also contributed to the\r\neconomic and social development of my country.\r\nUnited Nations agencies and especially the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) have\r\nactively participated in the implementation of many\r\nimportant programmes, thus finding lasting solutions to\r\nmany challenges and helping our young democracy to\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nsurvive. We also commend the activity of UNICEF in\r\nMoldova for helping the newest generation of our\r\ncitizens navigate through this difficult period of\r\ntransition.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express my Government’s warmest\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the efforts he\r\nhas exerted in order to maintain peace and security and\r\nfor his outstanding contribution to promoting and\r\nfostering the role of the United Nations. The award of\r\nthe centennial Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations\r\nand its Secretary-General was highly welcomed all\r\nover the world.\r\nIn this year’s annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization the Secretary-General writes:\r\n“Developments during the past year have\r\naffirmed the Organization’s increasing relevance\r\nin world affairs; but a review of the work of the\r\nOrganization is also a reminder that much still\r\nneeds to be done to achieve the aims and goals of\r\nthe Charter and the Millennium Declaration.”\r\n(A/57/1; para. 230)\r\nLet us work even harder to ensure that the United\r\nNations is able to meet the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nchairman of the delegation of Antigua and Barbuda,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Patrick Albert Lewis.\r\nMr. Lewis (Antigua and Barbuda): Let me\r\nexpress my country’s delight in having Mr. Jan Kavan\r\npreside over this fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. Antigua and Barbuda owes much to the\r\nCzech Republic and the adherents of the religious ideas\r\nof Jan Hus, the Moravians, who arrived in Antigua in\r\nthe mid-eighteenth century and administered to the\r\nslaves in a manner uncommon at that time. With\r\nhumanity and audacity they provided education to\r\nchattel servants, which was certainly one of the\r\nfoundations that led to the development of a sturdy,\r\nprogressive, and optimistic people, who this year\r\ncelebrate the twenty-first anniversary of successful\r\nindependence.\r\nLet me also pay tribute to Mr. Kavan’s\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Han Seung-soo, who\r\nguided the fifty-sixth session through a perilous period,\r\nyet found time to formulate positions to streamline our\r\nwork and enhance the functions of the President. I wish\r\nadditionally to welcome Switzerland into this body; we\r\nare mindful of the contributions it has made to our\r\nendeavours over the many years that we wished that it\r\nwould become formally incorporated.\r\nOn 18 June 2001 Antigua and Barbuda ratified\r\nthe Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court\r\nand was most pleased when on 11 April 2002 ten States\r\nsimultaneously deposited instruments of ratification,\r\nwhich brought the number of States that had ratified\r\nthe Statute to 66, six more than was required to bring it\r\ninto force. The reality is that this has been achieved at\r\na remarkably swift pace, demonstrating that the\r\nGovernments and peoples of the globe recognized the\r\nneed for the existence of such a body. My own country\r\nfollowed the process of development closely and\r\nparticipated in many conferences, seminars and\r\npreparatory commissions on the subject.\r\nThe adoption of the Statute manifested a\r\nrevolution in legal and moral attitudes toward some of\r\nthe worst crimes on earth. Whereas many developing\r\nStates have suffered under the hard yoke of\r\nglobalization, the International Criminal Court, with its\r\nprinciples of justice and the rule of law in international\r\naffairs represents a plus for the globalization process.\r\nNonetheless, much work remains to be done in\r\nobtaining worldwide ratification of the Rome Statute,\r\nensuring that the Court will have the appropriate\r\nmechanisms in place to begin functioning as early as\r\npossible and disseminating information to stakeholders\r\nat the national and international levels about the ICC,\r\nthe Rome Statute and its supporting documents.\r\nThe fears of some States concerning the operation\r\nof the Court when it is effectuated next year must be\r\novercome. The Statute has sufficient checks and\r\nbalances to allay all fears, and we remain convinced\r\nthat the ICC will be a legitimate judicial institution to\r\nadequately judge individuals for war crimes, genocide\r\nand crimes against humanity. We reiterate our\r\nconviction that this can be done while guaranteeing\r\nStates their rights, as they are protected from any\r\ninterference by the Court if they pursue such crimes at\r\nthe national level, and that the prosecutor’s\r\nautonomous power is accompanied by guarantees\r\nagainst using the Court for specious or politically\r\nmotivated endeavours.\r\nAlthough we are thrilled at the pace of\r\ndevelopment with regard to the Court, if we look closer\r\nit reveals the peripheral influence of Caribbean States.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nIt was Trinidad and Tobago that revived the idea of the\r\nICC 41 years after the idea was first discussed. But the\r\nspecific concerns that Trinidad and Tobago and other\r\nCaribbean States advanced as reasons for creating the\r\nICC have been put on the back burner. We had pleaded\r\nfor a court that would try, and sentence, those involved\r\nin the trans-shipment of narcotics, in carrying out acts\r\nof terrorism and in committing marine violations,\r\nincluding those in our territorial waters. I am sure that\r\nit is not lost on members that in 1989 we were\r\nemphasizing the need for the proposed court to try\r\nterrorists. The Court is an acknowledgement of that. It\r\nemphasizes genocide, crimes against humanity and war\r\ncrimes — and we support this. Yet we remain akin to\r\nRalph Ellison’s “invisible man”.\r\nDuring the previous session, there were three\r\nmajor meetings on what can broadly be classified as\r\nfinancing for development. At Doha, 142 countries\r\nagreed to launch the next round of World Trade\r\nOrganization negotiations. Once again developing\r\ncountries, particularly those with monocultures, found\r\nthemselves stymied with regard to getting favourable\r\nterms for their agricultural products, but were\r\nsuccessful in convincing developed countries that it\r\nwas acceptable to override patents to stem public\r\nhealth crises such as HIV/AIDS. Developed nations\r\nfeared that that would diminish the effectiveness of the\r\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\r\nProperty Rights and discourage pharmaceutical\r\nresearch, but proponents of the change argued forcibly\r\nfrom the humanitarian perspective.\r\nDelegates from the developing countries left the\r\nconference hoping to get better results at Monterrey —\r\na Conference whose title specifically referred to\r\nfinancing for development. Unfortunately, most\r\ndecisions were made before the statements of the well-\r\nprepared delegates from both developed and\r\ndeveloping countries could be structurally evaluated.\r\nAt Monterrey, there were repeated references by\r\nboth developed and developing countries to the fact\r\nthat half of the world’s population lived on less than $2\r\na day. But to any objective observer, it was never clear\r\nfrom the pronouncements of the dominant countries\r\nwhether they could best help by significantly\r\nincreasing foreign aid or by more concretely targeting\r\ntheir assistance to make it more effective. Many of the\r\ndeveloping countries kept signalling that both measures\r\nwere necessary and should be undertaken.\r\nIt appeared that women were particularly\r\ndisappointed with the Conference. The Executive\r\nDirector of the United Nations Development Fund for\r\nWomen, Noeleen Heyzer, declared, “you cannot talk\r\nabout halving poverty without looking at the\r\nfeminization of poverty”. Heyzer was critical of the\r\nfact that the Conference was working with static\r\npoverty statistics. A member of her staff pointed out\r\nthat new ways of financing development had to\r\nconsider protecting domestic industries while preparing\r\nwomen to take advantage of new opportunities.\r\nMs. Heyzer stated that the meeting should have\r\nconsidered institutional and legal barriers to women’s\r\nadvancement, such as banking systems that did not\r\nlend to women, and customary laws which prevented\r\nfemale ownership of land.\r\nIn reality, not only aid, but a complete\r\noverhauling of the present unidimensional focus of\r\nglobalization should have come out of Monterrey. The\r\ngoals — halving the proportion of people living on less\r\nthan $1 a day by 2015, accelerating the process of\r\nproviding access by individuals to clean water, and\r\nensuring gender equity, particularly with regard to\r\neducation — cannot be considered to have been\r\nadequately dealt with by simply stating that aid from\r\nthe developed world would increase from $50 billion to\r\n$100 billion.\r\nIn addition, it must be recalled that only one third\r\nof the $50 billion is spent in poor countries, while the\r\nlevel of aid and the conditionalities attached to it\r\nmakes it difficult to spend the rest effectively. The\r\nstringent conditions set by donors also have an impact\r\non the sovereignty of developing nations. Thus,\r\njumping from $50 billion to $100 billion without\r\nrevamping existing measures of disbursal and\r\nimplementation will not have the desired effect.\r\nFortunately, the developing countries, through\r\ntheir perseverance, were able to receive greater\r\nconsideration in Johannesburg. The recent World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development represents the\r\nstrongest effort by the international community to\r\npromote sustainable development through the adoption,\r\nas set out in the Summit’s Plan of Implementation, of\r\nsignificant and concrete commitments to improve the\r\nlives of people living in poverty and to reverse the\r\ncontinuing degradation of the global environment.\r\nAs a small developing State, my country sought\r\nto contribute to the overriding theme of the Summit:\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nthe promotion of action. In this respect, we commend\r\nthe Summit for the major progress made in addressing\r\nsome of the most pressing concerns of small island\r\ndeveloping States, namely, poverty and the\r\nenvironment, and welcome the commitments to\r\nincrease access to clean water and proper sanitation\r\nand to energy services; to improve health conditions\r\nand agriculture, particularly in dry lands; and to better\r\nprotect the world’s biodiversity and ecosystems.\r\nHowever the Summit’s failure to agree on a target date\r\nfor increasing the use of renewable energy was a major\r\ndisappointment to all small island developing States.\r\nThe true test of the Summit’s success will be in\r\nthe follow-up actions at all levels. While in and of\r\nitself the Summit generated a sense of urgency,\r\ncommitments for action, and partnerships to achieve\r\nmeasurable results, concerted activity must be\r\nundertaken. Antigua and Barbuda therefore calls on all\r\nactors to honour their commitments and undertake the\r\nnecessary actions to fight poverty and protect the\r\nenvironment through the implementation of the\r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including\r\nthose contained in the General Assembly’s Millennium\r\nDeclaration and Agenda 21, adopted in Rio de Janeiro\r\nin 1992. This will require a significant increase in\r\nfinancial resources, as elaborated in the Monterrey\r\nConsensus.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda has every intention of\r\nadhering to the time allotment, but must of necessity\r\ntouch on a few other issues. Unfortunately, we must\r\nrecall the threat of terrorism. We have been working\r\ndiligently to fulfil the United Nations requirements in\r\nthat respect. We must, however, move ahead and plan\r\nfor the future positively. We welcome the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and are eagerly\r\nawaiting the entry of East Timor into this body.\r\nWhile welcoming East Timor, we must again\r\nexpress our deep dissatisfaction that a referendum has\r\nnot been held in the Western Sahara. The question of\r\nthe Western Sahara involves the right of self-\r\ndetermination, a fundamental principle of the United\r\nNations. As long as the conflict remains, the regional\r\nsecurity in a significant part of the Maghreb will\r\nremain at risk. Clearly, the success or failure of the\r\nUnited Nations will enhance or compromise the\r\ncredibility of the current international system.\r\nA small developing State, such as Antigua and\r\nBarbuda, cannot deliver a statement at the United\r\nNations General Assembly without mentioning the\r\nimperfections of globalization and calling again for\r\nmeaningful remedies. When we consider the present\r\nthrust toward globalization, we once again see our lack\r\nof significance in the global scheme of operations.\r\nClearly, globalization leads to the reduction of the\r\nsovereignty of States, with the weakest and the\r\nsmallest being the biggest losers. Sadly lacking in the\r\narguments for globalization is mention of the need to\r\ngive consideration to the pace, direction and content of\r\nliberalization. We must bear in mind the different\r\nlevels of development and the need to build up national\r\ncapabilities. There is much insistence on free trade for\r\nthe developing world and yet exemptions from free\r\ntrade are claimed for the industrialized countries.\r\nProtective devices are built in for farmers in the\r\ndominant economies. These include subsidies,\r\nguaranteed markets, payments not to produce beyond a\r\ncertain level in order to maintain means of processing,\r\nand all of this is done under the most stringent of\r\nguidelines.\r\nOn the other hand, when former colonial\r\ncountries provide preferences to their previous colonies\r\nfor investments, challenges are mounted through the\r\nWorld Trade Organization by multinational enterprises.\r\nAll this is done with the clear knowledge that in\r\nmodern times there has never been free trade.\r\nRecently, the envoy of a very large country,\r\nseeking the support of Antigua and Barbuda for his\r\ncandidature to a major international committee, praised\r\nour twin-island state for its prominence, rationality and\r\nobjectivity in international affairs. He went on to state\r\nthat small States are generally more objective in\r\nrecognizing which countries ought to have positions on\r\nmajor international bodies. This is, in his view, due to\r\nthe fact that small States can consider issues without\r\nhaving to take into consideration the pressures from\r\nlarge armies and the need to maintain international\r\nprominence. Consequently, small States view issues\r\nfrom the perspective of how policies affect the entire\r\nglobe, of how there can be improvements for all\r\npeople, and of what the consequences of certain actions\r\nwill be.\r\nIt was an exchange that sobered and uplifted me\r\nfor an entire week. Yes, small States can contribute\r\nmuch and have a significant role to play in the United\r\nNations. But we need to be looked at and to be listened\r\nto. We have much to contribute. We will continue to\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.18\r\nspeak out, to speak up, to advocate, to plead and\r\nentreat. We urge that we be fully recognized, for we are\r\npositive, compassionate and forward-looking.\r\nI end by offering to you the motto of my country:\r\n“Each endeavouring: all achieving.”\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n"
