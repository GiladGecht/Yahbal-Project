(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 20\r\nAdmission of new Members to the United Nations\r\n(rule 136)\r\nApplication for admission (A/56/953)\r\nLetter from the President of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/57/258)\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.3)\r\nThe President: I should like to invite the General\r\nAssembly to consider, under item 20 of the agenda,\r\nentitled Admission of new Members to the United\r\nNations, the positive recommendation by the Security\r\nCouncil on the application for admission to\r\nmembership in the United Nations of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nThe Security Council has recommended the\r\nadmission of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\r\nto membership in the United Nations, as stated in\r\ndocument A/57/258. In this connection, a draft\r\nresolution has been submitted in document A/57/L.3.\r\nI now would like to give the floor to the Prime\r\nMinister of the Portuguese Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. José Manuel Durão Barroso, to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.3.\r\nMr. José Manuel Durão Barroso, Prime Minister\r\nof the Portuguese Republic, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Durão Barroso (Portugal): Timor-Leste is a\r\ntriumph of the human spirit. It is also proof that\r\nadversity can always be overcome and that, in the end,\r\njustice prevails. As a Portuguese poet, Fernando\r\nPessoa, noted,\r\n(spoke in Portuguese)\r\nEverything is worthwhile when the soul is not\r\nsmall.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe Timorese people have shown us that they are\r\ntrue to the basic values we all believe in and that are\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Today,\r\nTimor-Leste is becoming a Member State of the United\r\nNations, although it must be said that the people of\r\nTimor-Leste have long been with us.\r\nTimor-Leste reminds us that the United Nations\r\nCharter reaffirms our collective faith in fundamental\r\nhuman rights, in the dignity and worth of the human\r\nperson, in the equal rights of men and women and of\r\nnations large and small. To these ends, we have\r\ncommitted ourselves to practice tolerance and live\r\ntogether in peace with one another as good neighbours.\r\nThis is the way for a new Member State to deal with\r\nthe world at large and, in turn, for all of us to deal with\r\nthe new Member State of Timor-Leste. In looking at\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nyou, people of Timor-Leste, we are looking at\r\nourselves.\r\nToday, we are also paying a fitting tribute to the\r\nwork of the United Nations in Timor-Leste. This is a\r\nsuccess story. It is also proof that in situations of\r\nconflict the United Nations can make a difference for\r\nthe better, provided it is fully supported by Member\r\nStates. It would only be fair to thank, in particular, the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ndetermination and single-mindedness in pursuing the\r\nright path  the path of freedom and peace. Timor-\r\nLeste and the international community owe him a great\r\ndeal.\r\nThe fate of Timor-Leste is now in the hands of\r\nthe Timorese and their elected President, Xanana\r\nGusmão. I would like also to recognize the presence\r\namong us of Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri, Foreign\r\nMinister Jose Ramos-Horta and the Bishop of Dili,\r\nDom Ximenes Belo. This is truly an impressive\r\ndelegation. We have today in the General Assembly\r\nthree Nobel Peace Prize winners  including\r\nSecretary-General Annan  and one Sakharov Prize\r\nwinner. No better tribute could be paid to the work of\r\nthe United Nations in Timor-Leste.\r\nThe new country still needs the support of the\r\ninternational community. For Timor-Leste, joining the\r\nUnited Nations is not the end of the road, since its very\r\nexistence as a democratic and potentially prosperous\r\nState still depends on our collective solidarity.\r\nInternational attention to Timor-Leste should not be\r\nreplaced by international indifference. Indeed, we must\r\nnow ensure that we do not lose the peace.\r\nI would now like to add a few words in\r\nPortuguese.\r\n(spoke in Portuguese; English text provided by the\r\ndelegation)\r\nI would like to express the great honour I feel in\r\nrepresenting the Portuguese people in a ceremony to\r\nwhich we attach the deepest meaning. The values that\r\nthe Timorese embody are the same values that the\r\nPortuguese defended for decades, in particular in this\r\nGeneral Assembly. It is therefore particularly\r\ngratifying for us to have worked together with the\r\nfriendly nations of Australia and Indonesia on the draft\r\nresolution that we are about to adopt.\r\nPortugal will continue to lend a friendly hand to\r\nTimor-Leste, a country with which, since the\r\nBrasilia summit, we have also been associated with in\r\nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries.\r\nThousands of Portuguese have served in the United\r\nNations operations in Timor-Leste and in the bilateral\r\ncooperation programmes that we began even before\r\nindependence. I can assure the Assembly that the\r\nPortuguese people and the people of Timor-Leste are\r\nmuch closer in terms of the affection that we feel than\r\nour geographical distance would suggest. The\r\nPortuguese poet, Camões, stated, the whole world is\r\nmade of change; but there is something that will\r\nhardly ever change: the friendship that all Portuguese\r\nfeel for the people of Timor-Leste.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOn behalf of the 135 sponsors, I have the honour\r\nto introduce to the General Assembly the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/57/L.3 and to\r\nrecommend its adoption by consensus, thereby\r\nwelcoming by acclamation Timor-Leste as the newest\r\nState Member of the United Nations.\r\nBem-vindo, Timor-Leste.\r\nThe President: Before proceeding to take action\r\non the draft resolution, I should like to announce that,\r\nsince the introduction of the draft resolution, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors of A/57/L.3:\r\nArmenia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Congo,\r\nDjibouti, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe, Saudi Arabia, Tonga, Turkey and Zimbabwe.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly accepts\r\nthe recommendation of the Security Council and adopts\r\nthe draft resolution by acclamation?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n57/3).\r\nThe President: I therefore declare the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste admitted to\r\nmembership in the United Nations.\r\nI request the Chief of Protocol to escort the\r\ndelegation of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\r\nto its place in the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste was escorted to its place in the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: It is my great honour and\r\nprivilege to welcome, on behalf of the General\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nAssembly, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste as\r\na new Member of the United Nations.\r\nOnly a few months ago  on 20 May 2002  we\r\ncongratulated the first elected President of Timor-\r\nLeste, His Excellency Xanana Gusmăo, and\r\nparticipated in the celebration of the independence of\r\nTimor-Leste. I was very happy to attend the\r\nindependence ceremony in person, and appreciated the\r\nfact that I had the opportunity to have a short\r\nconversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, His\r\nExcellency Jose Ramos-Horta. As a former human\r\nrights activist and a fighter for the independence of my\r\nown country, I bow in respect and salute the courage\r\nand determination of the President, the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs and other East-Timorese whose\r\nstruggle brought about the success we can celebrate\r\ntoday.\r\nTimor-Leste is the first independent State and\r\nnation to have emerged in the twenty-first century. We\r\nhave all watched with admiration how the people of\r\nTimor-Leste progressed towards their independence.\r\nWe all remember the developments that led to the\r\ncountrys independence. It was not easy, but the\r\ncountry and its people succeeded. I am very proud and\r\nhappy that the United Nations was an integral part of\r\nthat whole process.\r\nDespite numerous difficulties and barriers, the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in East Timor and the United\r\nNations Transitional Administration in East Timor,\r\nconfirmed that United Nations participation was the\r\nright way to help ensure a smooth transition to the\r\nstatus of an independent and sovereign State.\r\nThe peaceful transition process in Timor-Leste\r\nwas a prime example of the ability of the Security\r\nCouncil and the United Nations to respond promptly\r\nand decisively to pressing issues.\r\nTimor-Lestes independence, however, does not\r\nmark the end of United Nations involvement. On the\r\ncontrary, it signals the beginning of an important new\r\nphase to consolidate the achievements and to build on\r\nthem. The establishment of the United Nations Mission\r\nof Support in East Timor is one of the examples of\r\nsuch engagement.\r\nThe United Nations and its Member States should\r\nbe prepared to strengthen their support to the region\r\nand to the Government of Timor-Leste. They should\r\nhelp in addressing the many remaining issues that need\r\nto be resolved. Timor-Leste will, for example, need a\r\nfully functioning infrastructure to enable it to earn\r\nsufficient revenue so as not to need to rely on\r\ncontinuous aid in the future.\r\nWe wish the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\r\nand its people peace, prosperity and every success in\r\ntheir future and we warmly welcome Timor-Leste to\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI now call on the representative of Côte dIvoire\r\nto speak on behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nMr. Djangone-Bi (Côte dIvoire) (spoke in\r\nFrench): The Group of African States at the United\r\nNations fully appreciates the feelings of Timorese men\r\nand women on this historic day. It could not do\r\notherwise, since most of the countries of our Group\r\nhave known the bitter taste of colonization and\r\nundertaken national liberation struggles, along with the\r\njoy of proclaiming hard-won political independence\r\nand the pride and emotion of trading their territorial\r\nstatus for that of independent State and member of the\r\nfamily of sovereign countries within the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe African Group therefore salutes the courage\r\nof the Timorese people who, despite the tremendous\r\nobstacles they faced in their liberation struggle, have\r\nremained resolute in their will to sunder the chains that\r\nbound them to the yoke of colonization. Through me,\r\nthe African countries of the United Nations welcome\r\nthe delegation of Timor-Leste, led by Mr. Xanana\r\nGusmão, President of the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste, who is the very resolute embodiment of\r\nhis peoples desire for liberation. May he accept our\r\nwarm and brotherly congratulations on this\r\nachievement.\r\nThe African Group also takes this opportunity to\r\ncommend the remarkable work of the United Nations,\r\nand in particular that of Special Representative Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, in the creation of the new State.\r\nThe African Group reaffirms its support for the\r\nreconstruction and reconciliation efforts of the\r\ninternational community on behalf of Timor-Leste. We\r\nbelieve that, like a newborn child, that country must be\r\nthe focus of the attention of its development partners in\r\nthe international community. For its part, Africa is\r\nprepared to lend its fraternal support and cooperation.\r\nIn that respect, we wish the new State peaceful\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\ncoexistence with all its neighbours so that it may\r\ndevote itself fully to the countrys development.\r\nIn celebrating Timor-Lestes entry into the great\r\nUnited Nations family, the African Group would\r\nremind everyone that we are in the Second\r\nInternational Decade for the Eradication of\r\nColonialism and that there remain 16 non-self-\r\ngoverning territories on the list of territories still to be\r\ndecolonized. Let us therefore strive, like Timor-Leste,\r\nto rid the world of colonialism in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative\r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran to speak on behalf of\r\nthe Group of Asian States.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran): I am\r\nhonoured and privileged to speak today on behalf of\r\nthe Asian Group to welcome an Asian country to the\r\nUnited Nations family. We are extremely pleased to\r\nhave among us the delegation of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, led by President Xanana\r\nGusmão. We offer our most sincere congratulations to\r\nPresident Gusmão and through him to the people and\r\nGovernment of East Timor on their countrys\r\nadmission today to the United Nations. It is a pleasant\r\nmoment for all of us to witness the independence of\r\nTimor-Leste through the central political role of the\r\nUnited Nations and the commendable cooperation and\r\nsupport of its Member States.\r\nOur Group is very much aware that there are\r\nmany pressing needs and priorities for the new nation\r\nof East Timor. We are encouraged by the wisdom and\r\nforesight of the leadership as well as the people of\r\nTimor-Leste, who have adopted a forward-looking\r\nattitude. We in the Asian Group welcome the excellent\r\nand fast-growing relations between Timor-Leste and\r\nother countries in the region, particularly Indonesia.\r\nUndoubtedly, ongoing and timely international support\r\nand cooperation are imperative to enable post-\r\nindependence Timor-Leste to make quick and steady\r\nprogress.\r\nOnce again, I would like to express our best\r\nwishes to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste on\r\nthis significant event and to wish the Government and\r\npeople of Timor-Leste peace, prosperity and a bright\r\nfuture.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative\r\nof Ukraine to speak on behalf of the Group of Eastern\r\nEuropean States.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): On behalf of the\r\nGroup of Eastern European States and my own country,\r\nUkraine, I have the honour and great pleasure to\r\ncongratulate the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\r\non its admission to the United Nations.\r\nThe attainment of independence by Timor-Leste\r\nmarked the culmination of a long process of self-\r\ndetermination and transition. On 20 May, history was\r\nmade in Dili as the Timorese celebrated the birth of\r\ntheir country  the first independent nation of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nGreat progress has been made over the past two\r\nand a half years in establishing the foundations of the\r\nState, in particular in the political and security spheres.\r\nThe Timorese has set an example through their\r\nsteadfast adherence to the core values of the United\r\nNations Charter, to reconciliation and to the creation of\r\ndemocratic institutions aimed at safeguarding human\r\nrights and values.\r\nIn May, all of us in the General Assembly\r\ncongratulated the East Timorese Government and\r\npeople on their attainment of independence. We paid\r\ntribute to the leaders of Timor-Leste for their efforts in\r\nachieving that goal.\r\nThe United Nations has played a crucial role in\r\nrestoring peace to that nation and in building a solid\r\nbasis for a democratic, viable and stable State. Let me\r\nexpress our deepest appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Special Representative, Sergio Vieira\r\nde Mello, as well as to the Governments of Australia\r\nand Indonesia, for their efforts to make this possible.\r\nWe commend the United Nations Transitional\r\nAdministration in East Timor for the important work it\r\nhas done to assist the people of Timor-Leste to develop\r\na sustainable social system. Their work constitutes a\r\nvivid example of the Organizations ability to tackle\r\nthe hardest tasks and achieve tangible results. The\r\nunique challenges of the Timor-Leste transition have\r\nalso provided an opportunity for our Organization and\r\nits Member States to put into practice new approaches\r\nto peacekeeping and to post-conflict peace-building\r\nand reconstruction.\r\nTodays historic occasion fills our hearts with\r\npride, dignity and joy. Let me welcome the Democratic\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, congratulate the Group of\r\nAsian States and wish the Government and the people\r\nof Timor-Leste every success, and prosperity and\r\npeace.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Irma Loemban Tobing-Klein,\r\nPermanent Representative of Suriname, who will speak\r\non behalf of the Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nMrs. Loemban Tobing-Klein (Suriname):\r\nEspecially today, on such a wonderful occasion  the\r\nadmittance of a new Member to the greatest family of\r\nnations  we should extend peace and love to one\r\nanother and to the Government and the people of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste in the light of the\r\npeace message that the Secretary-General and the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly presented to us last\r\nFriday on the eve of 21 September, the International\r\nDay of Peace, when we, the international community,\r\napplauded the United Nations call for a global ceasefire\r\nand non-violence.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States, I am very pleased to wholeheartedly\r\nwelcome the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste as\r\nthe new, 191st State Member of the United Nations.\r\nThe East Timorese people fought a hard battle to gain\r\ntheir independence. We can only suspect that, after\r\nsuch a struggle, the people of Timor-Leste will work\r\neven harder to safeguard their democratic\r\nindependence and their human rights, for they know\r\nwhat it means to strive for a nation in which justice,\r\ndemocracy and human rights rule.\r\nWe also commend the international community,\r\nin particular the Governments of Indonesia and\r\nPortugal, the United Nations, the Secretary-General\r\nand the United Nations administration in Timor-Leste,\r\nfor assisting Timor-Leste to become an independent\r\nnation. The people of Timor-Leste have thus had an\r\nexcellent introduction to, and experience with, our\r\nOrganization and our family of nations, which work to\r\nimprove the life of each of our people and each of their\r\npeople, and to promote a life of dignity.\r\nThe Governments and the peoples of all countries\r\nmembers of the Latin American and Caribbean Group\r\ncongratulate the Government, the people and the\r\nPresident of Timor-Leste at this great milestone and\r\nexpress the wish and the prayer that peace and love\r\nmay prevail every day, everywhere, under all\r\ncircumstances.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Gonçalo de Santa Clara Gomes, the\r\nrepresentative of Portugal, to speak on behalf of the\r\nWestern European and other States.\r\nMr. De Santa Clara Gomes (Portugal): It is for\r\nme a great honour to address the Assembly as\r\nChairman of the Western European and other States\r\nGroup, upon the admission of Timor-Leste as a State\r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nThis meeting today is the culmination of a long\r\nand difficult process through which the Timorese\r\npeople chose to be independent and to live according to\r\nthe principles that we in this Organization cherish the\r\nmost: democracy, the rule of law and respect for human\r\nrights. I am sure that Timor-Lestes membership in the\r\nUnited Nations will contribute to the efforts of the\r\nOrganization to strengthen those principles around the\r\nworld.\r\nTimorese involvement with the United Nation is\r\nnot new. We have all supported, we have all\r\nparticipated in and we have all followed with intense\r\nemotion the joint effort that the United Nations and the\r\nTimorese have made to bring this new country into the\r\ninternational community. The presence here today of a\r\ndistinguished delegation from Timor-Leste is evidence\r\nof that countrys continued commitment to the United\r\nNations. The members of the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States look forward to working\r\nclosely with the Timorese authorities and their\r\nrepresentatives here.\r\nI would like to conclude by paying a special\r\ntribute to President Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister\r\nMari Alkatiri, Foreign Minister José Ramos-Horta and\r\nBishop Ximenes Belo for their role in leading Timor-\r\nLeste to independence.\r\nI must also extend warm appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his personal engagement in the\r\nprocess that led to this new membership. As the\r\nTimorese flag is raised today, we will all have reason to\r\nbe proud.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. James Cunningham, representative of\r\nthe United States of America, the host country.\r\nMr. Cunningham (United States of America):\r\nLast May we celebrated the rise of the Timorese people\r\nfrom the ashes of conflict and their creation of an\r\nindependent nation. Today we celebrate that nations\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\naccession to its rightful place in the meeting house of\r\nmankind, the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of the United States, it gives me great\r\npleasure to offer Timor-Leste a warm welcome to\r\nUnited Nations membership. This day is made all the\r\nmore profound by the close and unique relationship\r\nTimor-Leste has had with the United Nations. Through\r\nthe United Nations Transitional Administration in East\r\nTimor and now the United Nations Mission of Support\r\nin East Timor, the United Nations and its membership\r\nhave done much to help the Timorese people in their\r\nhard-fought quest for freedom.\r\nThe United States is proud to have been able to\r\nplay a part in that success. United States assistance to\r\nTimor-Leste stands at $25 million annually, and it is\r\none of our largest bilateral aid programmes in the\r\nworld on a per capita basis. In truth, Timor-Leste\r\nwould never have reached the milestone we mark today\r\nwithout the tenacity and the spirit of its people. It is\r\nthose same great people who are now taking the reigns\r\nof their new freedom and are working for a brighter\r\nfuture.\r\nWe applaud the Timorese Government for its\r\nefforts to build a nation that can stand on its own two\r\nfeet. We welcome its work towards a nation that enjoys\r\nopen, inclusive democracy, a market economy, a just\r\nlegal system and harmonious relations with its\r\nneighbours. We encourage that work to continue.\r\nFinally, let me reiterate the commitment of the\r\nUnited States to close, cooperative relations with\r\nTimor-Leste. We will be with you, the people of Timor-\r\nLeste, as you forge your own future and as you carve\r\nout your own place in the community of nations.\r\nWelcome, friends.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Australia.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): As it is for the people of\r\nEast Timor today, it is an emotional moment here for\r\nthe people of Australia as well. On behalf of the\r\nGovernment and the people of Australia, we want to\r\nwelcome Timor-Leste into the United Nations family.\r\nIt is a special honour for me today to have jointly\r\nsponsored, with colleagues from Portugal and\r\nIndonesia, resolution 57/3, which formalizes Timor-\r\nLestes United Nations membership. That Timor-Leste\r\nstands here today as a United Nations Member State is,\r\nmore than anything else, testament to the resolve,\r\nstrength and courage of the East Timorese people, and\r\nit is a great pleasure for us all to see such an impressive\r\ndelegation from East Timor with us today. It points also\r\nto the exceptional work of the United Nations and of\r\nUnited-Nations-authorized missions. This has been a\r\ngreat success story for the United Nations, and it is\r\nfitting therefore that Timor-Leste should join the\r\nOrganization that was crucial in bringing stability,\r\norder and renewed hope to its people.\r\nAustralia will continue to play a leading role in\r\nthe United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor\r\nand as a bilateral friend and partner to Timor-Leste. We\r\nappeal to others in the international community to\r\nremain committed as well.\r\nAustralia and Timor-Leste are neighbours forever.\r\nFrom our perspective, we will always be good\r\nneighbours.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Hidayat (Indonesia): Allow me to begin by\r\nexpressing our sincerest appreciation to you, Mr.\r\nPresident, for convening this historic meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to admit the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste as the 191st Member of the United\r\nNations. On this glorious occasion for the Government\r\nand the people of the newborn State, we are deeply\r\nhonoured to share in their moment of joy. Indeed, the\r\npresence of President Xanana Gusmão in our midst\r\ntoday lends powerful expression to this momentous\r\noccasion, as his country takes its rightful place among\r\nthe community of nations.\r\nAs Timor-Lestes closest neighbour, Indonesia\r\nwould like to express its sincere congratulations to its\r\nGovernment and its people. Indonesia is, of course,\r\nproud to have been one the initiators, together with\r\nAustralia and Portugal, of the draft resolution to admit\r\nEast Timor as a Member of the United Nations.\r\nFour months ago, on the eve of Timor-Lestes\r\nindependence, President Megawati Soekarnoputri\r\nvisited Dili to help cement the new and promising\r\nrelationship between our two countries. Likewise, the\r\nState visit of President Xanana Gusmão to Jakarta in\r\nearly July this year greatly helped strengthen that\r\ngrowing bond. Since those two milestone visits, our\r\ncountries have embarked on a strong partnership,\r\nwhich is evident in the increasing number of concrete\r\nand mutually beneficial achievements. One such event\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nthat has greatly bolstered the new relationship is the\r\nestablishment of the Joint Commission, a forum for\r\ndiscussing pertinent issues and searching for mutually\r\nbeneficial answers to issues of common interest.\r\nIn a similar vein, I see continuing progress in\r\nsuch undertakings as my Governments initiative to\r\nhold the first ministerial meeting of the Southwest\r\nPacific Dialogue. That dialogue, which will take place\r\nearly next month, is designed to facilitate the\r\ndiscussion of issues of common interest and concern to\r\nIndonesia, Timor-Leste and four other friendly\r\ncountries on issues such as economic cooperation and\r\ntransnational crime, including terrorism and people-\r\nsmuggling.\r\nAll those steps are part of a number of tangible\r\nefforts to build stronger relationships bilaterally and\r\nregionally between Indonesia and Timor-Leste, which\r\nwill augur well for the future. The courage of the\r\nleaders and the peoples of both countries to step\r\nforward to construct a future on the basis of those\r\nobjectives should be applauded. We are confident that\r\nthe international community cherishes the new and\r\nforward-looking spirit of cooperation. However, we are\r\nfully aware that our brothers and sisters in Timor-Leste\r\nare facing daunting challenges, especially in the areas\r\nof capacity-building, education, health and other basic\r\nservices, and, of course, poverty eradication. To that\r\nend, Indonesia is ready to extend its collaboration,\r\nincluding through South-South cooperation.\r\nIn conclusion, let me once again, on behalf of the\r\nGovernment and people of Indonesia, express our\r\nsincere congratulations and best wishes to the\r\nGovernment and people of East Timor on this\r\nauspicious occasion.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Brazil, who will speak on behalf of\r\nthe Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil): I have the honour of\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Community of Portuguese-\r\nSpeaking Countries (CPLP) to welcome Timor-Leste\r\ninto this Organization. Ours is a warm and\r\nwholehearted welcome from countries that, beyond a\r\ncommon language and culture, also share with Timor-\r\nLeste a firm commitment to the principles of\r\ndemocracy, liberty, justice, peace and universalism.\r\nThe countrys admission into the membership of\r\nthe United Nations represents another accomplishment\r\nof the brave Timorese people in their long, heroic\r\nstruggle for self-determination. The accession of\r\nTimor-Leste is one more accomplishment in the\r\nsuccess story that this Organization helped to bring\r\nabout. Barely five months ago, we were gathering in\r\nthe Security Council to celebrate its independence.\r\nMore recently, in July, Brazil had the honour of hosting\r\na summit of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking\r\nCountries, in which our Community had the pleasure of\r\nreceiving Timor-Leste in our midst.\r\nThe admission of new Members is a special\r\nmoment for the Organization itself, a moment in which\r\nwe rekindle the wishes and hopes placed in the United\r\nNations as an effective instrument for the resolution of\r\nchallenges that lie ahead, especially those which, given\r\nthe global scope, can be addressed only through\r\nmultilateral channels. It is also a confirmation of the\r\nuniversality of the values that brought us together and,\r\nin that sense, the confirmation of our commitments to\r\nthese values.\r\nIn the case of Timor-Leste, though, this is\r\ncomplemented by a feeling of accomplishment and of\r\nhaving contributed to this Organization through the\r\nvery existence of the partner we now welcome into our\r\ncollective home. The critical role played by the United\r\nNations in the historic birth of an independent Timor-\r\nLeste is a vivid example that the United Nations can\r\nharness political will and resources  financial and\r\nhuman resources  effectively, thus making a\r\ndifference in the lives of the most vulnerable.\r\nThe story of the independence of Timor-Leste\r\nmust serve as an inspiration for us to muster the will to\r\ntackle the challenges that remain on the international\r\nagenda. The remarkable achievement of independence\r\ndoes not conclude the obligations of the international\r\ncommunity towards that country. The tasks and\r\nresponsibilities of the United Nations in Timor-Leste\r\nare far from over. The success of the United Nations\r\nMission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) will\r\nrequire the same level of political commitment that\r\ncharacterized the support of the United Nations\r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).\r\nTimor-Leste is a developing country in need of\r\ninternational assistance. In this context, it becomes\r\neven more pressing to continue to bring in income-\r\ngenerating projects, maintain the flow of international\r\naid and create the conditions for sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nWithin the means available, the member countries\r\nof the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries\r\nwill continue to provide support for the rehabilitation,\r\nreconstruction and development of Timor-Leste,\r\nbearing in mind the need for financial, material and\r\ntechnical assistance.\r\nBefore concluding, Sir, allow me to pay tribute to\r\nmy fellow countryman, Sergio Vieira de Mello, who,\r\nwhile serving as the head of UNTAET, played a crucial\r\nrole on the road to Timor-Lestes independence. Under\r\nhis competent guidance, an unprecedented success in\r\nthe history of the United Nations has been achieved.\r\nA word of recognition and admiration also is due\r\nto President Xanana Gusmão, a hero in the struggle for\r\nindependence, who has now been trusted with the task\r\nof guiding Timor-Leste in its early steps as a full\r\nmember of the international community. We also want\r\nto salute Prime Minister Alkatiri, Foreign Minister\r\nRamos-Horta and Bishop Belo, remarkable leaders of a\r\nbrave people.\r\nWelcome, Timor-Leste.\r\n(spoke in Portuguese)\r\nWelcome, Timor-Leste.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Saint Lucia, Chairman of the Special\r\nCommittee on the Situation with regard to the\r\nImplementation of the Declaration on the Granting of\r\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.\r\nMr. Huntley (Saint Lucia): As Chair of the\r\nSpecial Committee of 24 on decolonization, I have the\r\nhonour to welcome the Democratic Republic of Timor-\r\nLeste to the membership of this Organization and to\r\nconvey the profound pleasure of the members of the\r\nCommittee in so doing.\r\nOn this day, momentous for the people of East\r\nTimor, we cannot help but recall the years when their\r\nrepresentatives appeared time and again before the\r\nSpecial Committee here in New York to present their\r\ncase for decolonization. We admire and respect the\r\nresolve of the people of Timor-Leste in search of their\r\nobjective.\r\nAnd so, today, as they are finally free to take their\r\nseat as an independent State in the United Nations\r\nfamily, we believe that, with similar purposefulness,\r\ntheir contribution to our deliberations will enrich this\r\nbody.\r\nIn welcoming the newest nation into the halls of\r\nthe United Nations, we should not forget that Timor-\r\nLeste is still in the infancy of its development and\r\nnation-building. The international community has\r\nplayed an important role in the long journey of the East\r\nTimorese to full membership in the United Nations.\r\nBoth the international community and the United\r\nNations must now be a part of the process of the\r\ndevelopment of the new nation and assist this process\r\nby providing unremitting and generous support.\r\nHelping Timor-Leste to stand on its own as a viable\r\neconomy is a debt that we owe its people.\r\nToday is also a significant day for the members of\r\nthe Special Committee of 24, for it marks the\r\nconfirmation of the removal of one more territory from\r\nits list of non-self-governing territories. The de-listing\r\nof Timor-Leste has left 16 other non-self-governing\r\nterritories on the list of the Special Committee as\r\nterritories yet to exercise their right to self-\r\ndetermination. The majority of these are very small\r\nislands, and because they are islands that are so small,\r\nand so remote, we sense that the international\r\ncommunity prefers to remain indifferent to them.\r\nLet us not let the special circumstances or the\r\nfading of the glamour that marked the United Nations\r\ndecolonization drive four decades ago obscure the right\r\nto self-determination of these territories. Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan reminded us earlier this year that\r\nthere should be no room for colonialism in the twenty-\r\nfirst century and that all efforts should be made to\r\nclose this chapter of history once and for all.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of the\r\nSpecial Committee, to encourage all Administering\r\nPowers to work hand in hand with the Special\r\nCommittee of 24 to attain this goal. In doing so,\r\nhowever, we must remember that what must be of\r\ncardinal importance is that the freely expressed wishes\r\nand the interests of the people of those territories must\r\nalways be paramount in determining their future mode\r\nof governance out of the three options prescribed by\r\nthe United Nations. To do otherwise would be to sow\r\nthe seeds of conflict.\r\nTherefore, as we welcome Timor-Leste here\r\ntoday, let us do so with a commitment renewed by the\r\njoy of this occasion to ensure that within this Second\r\nInternational Decade for the Eradication of\r\nColonialism, the peoples of the remaining non-self-\r\ngoverning territories shall also peacefully exercise their\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nright to self-determination with the full support of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nAnd so I say again: congratulations and welcome,\r\nTimor-Leste, welcome!\r\nAddress by Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, President\r\nof the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Kay Rala Xanana\r\nGusmão, President of the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste.\r\nMr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the great pleasure to welcome to the\r\nUnited Nations the President of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, His Excellency Mr. Kay Rala\r\nXanana Gusmão, and to invite him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nPresident Gusmão (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Since the\r\n1960s, Timor-Leste had been on the list of non-self-\r\ngoverning territories, with the right to exercise self-\r\ndetermination and independence in accordance with its\r\npeoples aspirations for freedom. Many countries have\r\nin fact achieved their independence since that time.\r\nThe universal principles enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations were the points of reference for\r\nour actions, both as part of the resistance within the\r\ncountry and during the long journey made with\r\nconfidence and determination by the Timorese people\r\nside by side with the peoples of Angola, Brazil, Cape\r\nVerde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal and Sao\r\nTome and Principe, and with activists from all over the\r\nworld. Human rights and the fundamental right of\r\npeoples to decide their own destinies are an expression\r\nof the struggle for the emancipation of every human\r\nbeing as an individual, as part of a society and, of\r\ncourse, as a people  in this case, as the Timorese\r\npeople that we are proud to be.\r\nIn this great Hall of the peoples of the entire\r\nworld, where peoples are heard through their\r\nrepresentatives and where we had the privilege of\r\nattending the Millennium Assembly, since 1975,\r\nTimor-Leste has been present in minds and hearts, in\r\npolitical debates, in geo-strategic discussions and in the\r\nresolutions adopted. Timorese diplomats  led by the\r\nguerrilla of diplomacy, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate\r\nMr. Jose Ramos-Horta  heads of State or\r\nGovernment, the representatives of friendly nations and\r\nof organizations of international solidarity worked\r\ntirelessly as they roamed the corridors of this home of\r\nthe community of nations. During the terms of office of\r\nKurt Waldheim, Javier Pérez de Cuellar, Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali and Kofi Annan, the Security Council,\r\nthe Special Committee of 24, the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights and others have kept their doors open to\r\nlisten to the voice of the people of Timor-Leste.\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan decisively took\r\ninto his hands not only the suffering but, above all, the\r\naspirations of our people. People such as Francesc\r\nVendrell and Tamrat Samuel, who worked on the\r\nquestion of Timor-Leste from the outset, as well as,\r\nsubsequently, Ambassador Jamsheed Marker, deserve\r\nour appreciation along with other staff members of this\r\ninstitution. They exemplified dedication and promoted\r\ndialogue in the search for a solution. The outcome of\r\nthat effort to defend the Charter and the freedom of\r\npeoples was the Agreement of 5 May 1999.\r\nIt is often said that it is important to start a\r\nprocess because doing so entails defining intentions\r\nand objectives. But, particularly in a struggle, the true\r\nvalue of action and work is found in the results. The\r\npopular consultation carried out by the United Nations\r\nMission in East Timor (UNAMET) under the\r\nleadership of Ian Martin was the first democratic and\r\nconscientious act of our people. First, it was\r\nconscientious because it was conducted in a totally\r\nadverse and uncontrollable climate. Secondly, it was\r\nconscientious because it revealed to the world the\r\ncourage of the people of Timor-Leste. And, lastly, it\r\nwas conscientious because our people rejected\r\nviolence, the idea of conflict between brothers and the\r\nnotion of civil war.\r\nOur people struggled for their freedom for more\r\nthan two decades. The long and difficult struggle\r\nattained its objectives, and the people of Timor-Leste\r\nwere not overly concerned by the use of violence and\r\nthe perpetuation of the conflict. The day of liberation,\r\n30 August 1999, was the day of democracy. Since that\r\nday, the United Nations Transitional Administration in\r\nEast Timor, led by Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, has\r\nmade every effort to strengthen the democratic\r\nawareness of our people as the basis for genuine\r\nindependence. As a consequence, on 30 August 2001\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nthe first elections were held for the Constituent\r\nAssembly, with presidential elections held in April\r\n2002.\r\nThe presence of the Secretary-General and of\r\nmore than 90 official delegations from around the\r\nworld  including the current President of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. Jan Kavan, who at the time was the\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Czech Republic  made 20 May 2002 a\r\nmemorable day in our history. The United Nations and\r\nthe international community at large did justice to the\r\ninternational principles and the universal values that\r\nuphold the existence of nations and peoples by\r\nrecognizing their inalienable right to self-determination\r\nand national independence.\r\nWe feel greatly honoured and moved by the\r\nstatesmanship shown by Portugal, Indonesia and\r\nAustralia in jointly proposing the draft resolution that\r\nhas admitted us as the 191st Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nI have the privilege today of representing before\r\nthe General Assembly a small people of great dignity\r\nand extraordinary historic bravery who are driven by a\r\ntotal commitment to the present and filled with great\r\nconfidence for the future. Present among us as our\r\nspecial guest is our most beloved brother, Nobel Peace\r\nPrize laureate Ximenes Belo. Despite his wish to be\r\nhere today to share this moment with us, our dear\r\nfriend Basilio do Nascimento had to remain in our\r\ncountry out of his sense of responsibility.\r\nI represent a people who have already defined\r\ntheir vision for development for the next 20 years. That\r\nvision expresses their most profound aspirations with\r\nregard to the eradication of poverty and illiteracy, the\r\nachievement of better standards of living  to which\r\nevery citizen has a right  and their own involvement\r\nin the development process. We are aware of the fact\r\nthat there will be no economic or social development in\r\nour country if we do not establish the most elementary\r\nbases of democracy. The role of women and a strong\r\ncivil society are essential to ensuring that participatory\r\ndemocracy at the level of local Government guarantee\r\nboth social justice and the rights of citizens.\r\nMore than just coming here as the head of State,\r\nthe honour I feel stems from representing the courage\r\nof the women of my country, the high spirits aroused\r\nby the sacrifice of our men, the determination of our\r\nyoung people and the smiles of the children of the\r\ncrocodile nation. According to our legend, today we\r\nhave been transformed. We tread firmly on our land\r\nand sail safely through our sea, for we have been\r\nrecognized as a sovereign and independent nation and\r\nas a member of the international community.\r\nHaving emerged from decades of struggle for our\r\nindependence and 20 years of suffering, what our\r\npeople most yearn for now is peace and stability. Only\r\na tolerant and just society can create a climate of much-\r\nneeded stability, and only a tolerant and just society\r\nwill know how to love peace.\r\nTimor-Leste expresses its concern over the\r\nincreasing violence in the Middle East. We will not\r\npoint fingers or attempt to identify culprits. We prefer\r\nto believe that a solution exists and that a resolution\r\ncan be found to this conflict, which has already shed so\r\nmuch blood and taken so many lives. The Palestinian\r\npeople have a right to self-determination,\r\nindependence, peace and dignity. We believe that it is\r\nneither moral nor ethical to deny the right to freedom,\r\npeace and dignity to this extraordinary people.\r\nTimor-Leste and the State of Israel have\r\nestablished diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial\r\nlevel and will explore forms of mutually beneficial\r\ncooperation. Timor-Leste declares itself ready to\r\nrecognize the State of Palestine and to establish\r\ndiplomatic relations at ambassadorial level with the\r\nlegitimate authorities of the Palestinian people.\r\nWestern Sahara is yet another entity that is\r\nregrettably excluded from most major international\r\nforums. Timor-Leste shares with our Saharawi brothers\r\na remarkable amount of history. The inalienable right\r\nof the Saharawi people to self-determination was\r\nrecognized by the United Nations eight years before\r\nthat of Timor-Leste. Yet, while the case of Timor-Leste\r\nis now seen as a United Nations success story, that of\r\nWestern Sahara continues to be stalled by successive\r\nobstacles. At this moment, when we are reaffirming our\r\nfreedom and independence, we urge the resumption of\r\nthe United Nations plan to hold a referendum on self-\r\ndetermination in Western Sahara. We can put an end to\r\nthis unjust situation only if a fair, free and democratic\r\nconsultation is held, such as that which took place in\r\nTimor-Leste.\r\nThe people of Timor-Leste also express their\r\nsupport for the peace process in Afghanistan and, in\r\nparticular, for President Hamid Karzai, and we extend\r\nour wishes for success at this challenging time.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nRecently, Timor-Leste attended the third Summit\r\nof African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) heads of State or\r\nGovernment, held in Fiji. This made us more aware of\r\nour need to actively participate in groups of developing\r\ncountries that share common problems and similar\r\nadvantages and backgrounds. There is much we can\r\nlearn from and exchange with subregional partners\r\nwithin a group such as the ACP.\r\nRegardless of our relationship with the Pacific,\r\nwe are geographically close to South-East Asia and\r\nalso feel proud of being part of that region. Over the\r\npast couple of years, we have intensified our contacts\r\nin the region. Today, we are pleased to testify to the\r\ncommitted work and unwavering commitment of our\r\nAsian brothers in the rebuilding of Timor-Leste, as\r\nwell as with respect to the requests for peacekeeping\r\nforces and for various professional personnel made by\r\nthe successive United Nations missions deployed in our\r\ncountry.\r\nWe recently participated in the Association of\r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial meeting\r\nheld in Brunei, and will continue to participate as\r\ninvited observers in the organizations initiatives.\r\nLast July, we became a full member of the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, a group\r\nof countries that share a common language, history and\r\nculture which contributed to the shaping of our\r\nresistance identity. That is also a family of nations to\r\nwhich we are bound by ties of affection.\r\nWe join the world in its concerns at intolerance\r\nbetween cultures and religions and at the systematic\r\nuse of violence, which cannot but breed\r\nmisunderstanding and hatred, further distancing\r\npeoples and constraining dialogue.\r\nWe speak out, with the rest of the world, on the\r\nwar on terrorism. Despite the enormous demands of\r\nour independence process and the developing nature of\r\nour country, we will not ease our vigilance and\r\ndetermination in uprooting the extremism and\r\nradicalism that promote or contribute to terror against\r\ninnocents. Timor-Leste will never be a sanctuary for\r\nthose who terrorize innocent civilians, whether on\r\nbehalf of religion or ideology, or in any other guise.\r\nWe join the rest of the world in its commitment to\r\nfight against people-smuggling and the trafficking of\r\narms and drugs. Transnational networks focusing on\r\nsuch repugnant activities have particularly affected our\r\nregion. We will not permit our territory or our\r\nexclusive economic zone to be used to perpetuate the\r\ngrief caused by the ambition of a few who hide behind\r\nprofits made out of the misery of so many.\r\nWe join the rest of the world in its commitment to\r\nadopt comprehensive policies on the democratization\r\nof societies, the respect for civic and political rights,\r\nthe need for good governance and the involvement of\r\ncivil society, and on the adoption of stern policies\r\nagainst corruption. We join the rest of the world in its\r\nconcern for the misery, hunger and disease in\r\ndeveloping countries, which affect more than half of\r\nthe planets population.\r\nThere must be a steadfast commitment by the\r\ndeveloping countries to adopt the correct policies to\r\nfight poverty. However, other important factors must be\r\ntaken into account. We join those calling on the rich\r\ncountries of the North to increase their contribution to\r\noverseas development assistance to at least 0.7 per cent\r\nof their gross national product. We join those calling\r\nfor writing off the debt of the poor countries as an\r\nunavoidable measure. We join those calling for\r\nrescheduling the debt of the most heavily indebted\r\ncountries, and investing part of the debt in education\r\nand public health. We join those calling for greater\r\naccess to the markets of the rich countries, through the\r\nlifting of trade barriers and the easing and\r\nsimplification of customs rules and regulations.\r\nThe European Union everything but guns\r\ncooperation policy is an example that should be\r\nfollowed by other rich countries. But the policy on\r\nagricultural subsidies has placed poorer countries at a\r\ngreat disadvantage and has left them in continued\r\npoverty. We, the poorest country in Asia, now also face\r\nthe daunting challenge of globalization.\r\nWe have adopted a policy of reconciliation among\r\nall Timorese, based on justice. Nevertheless, to honour\r\njustice, our effort is focused on the eradication of all\r\nfeelings of hatred and revenge, because sound\r\nreconciliation will come about only when there is\r\ngreater social justice in Timorese society.\r\nOur destiny is to live in peace. This means that\r\nwe must, from the outset, lay the foundations of a new\r\nsociety where harmony, tolerance and solidarity prevail\r\nin the mind and spirit of every citizen. We are aware\r\nthat we will be serving the interests of our people only\r\nif we honour our international commitments by signing\r\nthe relevant conventions and treaties which not only\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nsafeguard our sovereignty and our interests but also\r\nrespect the sovereignty and interests of other peoples\r\nand States, particularly those of our region. I refer in\r\nparticular to the Convention Against Torture, the\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention\r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees and those on the use\r\nof chemical weapons, nuclear weapons and landmines.\r\nAs the people of the first new country of the\r\nmillennium, and given the historic process leading to\r\nindependence, the Maubere people are committed to\r\nsocial and economic development, to strengthening\r\ntheir culture and traditions and to being actively\r\nengaged in a policy of dialogue, cooperation and\r\nfriendship with all the other peoples of the world. The\r\npeople of Timor-Leste firmly believe in a future where\r\nworld peace will reign. The people of Timor-Leste are\r\nconvinced that peace has a price. That price is the\r\nfreedom of people, tolerance among societies of\r\ndifferent cultures and beliefs, and cooperation and\r\nfriendship between peoples.\r\nInternational Day of Peace, 21 September, was\r\nthe dream come true of one man, and it shook the\r\nconscience of todays world, where humanity lives side\r\nby side with insecurity. We believe that peace is the\r\nmost sacred objective of humanity. We urge all human\r\nbeings  from the largest urban centres to remote\r\nfarms and plantations, from social and professional\r\norganizations, artists and athletes to civil society and\r\nbusiness people, from groups in conflict to politicians\r\nand cabinet members  to concentrate, together,\r\ngreater energy on the need for peace in the world.\r\nI wish to put forward a proposal to declare a\r\nWorld Peace Week, to be observed from 21 to\r\n27 September each year. During that week, debates,\r\nconferences and workshops to discuss peace would be\r\nheld throughout the world. Peace would no longer be a\r\ntheoretical concept, but would rather be an issue for in-\r\ndepth reflection on relevant themes such as poverty,\r\ndemocracy, human rights and justice. Thus, individuals\r\nwould truly comprehend that genuine peace can emerge\r\nonly from the peace within each citizen.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to pay tribute to my people.\r\nThe international community, politicians and\r\nacademics often speak of our country as a United\r\nNations success story. The commitment of the\r\ninternational community  namely, the United Nations\r\nand its bodies the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil  is unquestioned. That collective success is\r\nequally due to the role and the engagement of the\r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies, of the World\r\nBank, of the International Monetary Fund and of the\r\nAsian Development Bank, as well as of the hundreds of\r\nUnited Nations Volunteers and international non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, in particular during the\r\nemergency and humanitarian relief periods. Today, we\r\nwish to express our recognition of, and our profound\r\ngratitude for, their commitment and their continued\r\naction in my country.\r\nAt the core of that success were, above all, our\r\npeople. By refusing to go down the path of violence,\r\neven when provoked; by exercising their rights in a\r\ndemocratic and civic-minded manner, even if it meant\r\nrisking their own lives; and by looking to the future\r\nwith hope for the certainty of freedom, our people\r\nproved to the world that they were worthy of respect,\r\nand thus gained credibility and the admiration of all.\r\nWe owe the success to which all were committed to the\r\npeople of Timor-Leste.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Kay Rala Zanana Gusmão, President of the\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform Member\r\nStates that the flag of the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste will be raised at a ceremony that will take\r\nplace in front of the delegates entrance immediately\r\nfollowing the adjournment of this meeting.\r\nAgenda item 117\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/57/429)\r\nThe President: If there is no proposal under rule\r\n66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the report of\r\nthe Fifth Committee that is before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Statements will therefore be\r\nlimited to explanations of vote.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendation of the Fifth Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that, under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that\r\nWhen the same draft resolution is considered in\r\na Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a\r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its\r\nvote only once, that is, either in the Committee or\r\nin plenary meeting, unless that delegations vote\r\nin plenary meeting is different from its vote in the\r\nCommittee.\r\nMay I remind delegations that, also in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations\r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that\r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the\r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee\r\nin paragraph 7 of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do likewise?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n57/4).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item\r\n117.\r\nAgenda item 15\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(a) Election of five non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now\r\nproceed to the election of five non-permanent members\r\nof the Security Council to replace those members\r\nwhose term of office expires on 31 December 2002.\r\nThe five outgoing non-permanent members are\r\nthe following: Colombia, Ireland, Mauritius, Norway\r\nand Singapore. Those five States cannot be re-elected.\r\nTheir names, therefore, should not appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the\r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2003 the\r\nfollowing States: Bulgaria, Cameroon, Guinea, Mexico\r\nand the Syrian Arab Republic. The names of those\r\nStates, therefore, should also not appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members that will\r\nremain in office in the year 2003, three are from Africa\r\nand Asia, one is from Eastern Europe and one is from\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of General\r\nAssembly resolution 1991 A (XVIII) of 17 December\r\n1963, the five non-permanent members should be\r\nelected according to the following pattern: two from\r\nAfrica and Asia, one from Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean and two from Western Europe and other\r\nStates. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is\r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the two States to\r\nbe elected from Africa and Asia, one should be from\r\nAfrica and one from Asia.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those\r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of\r\nseats to be filled, that receive the greatest number of\r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of those present and\r\nvoting will be declared elected.\r\nIn the case of a tie vote for a remaining seat, there\r\nwill be a restricted ballot limited to those candidates\r\nthat have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by\r\nthe Chairmen of the respective regional groups of the\r\nfollowing.\r\nFor the two vacant seats from among the African\r\nand Asian States, there are two endorsed candidates:\r\nAngola and Pakistan.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nFor the vacant seat from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there is one endorsed\r\ncandidate: Chile.\r\nFor the two vacant seats from among the Western\r\nEuropean and other States, there are two endorsed\r\ncandidates: Germany and Spain.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall proceed now to the election by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked A, B and C will now\r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only\r\nthose ballot papers that have been distributed.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot\r\npapers marked A, for the African and Asian States,\r\nthe names of the two States for which they wish to\r\nvote; on the ballot papers marked B, for the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the name of the one\r\nState for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot\r\npapers marked C, for the Western European and\r\nother States, the names of the two States for which they\r\nwish to vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid. Names of Member States on a\r\nballot paper which do not belong to that region will not\r\nbe counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Luke\r\nSookocheff (Canada), Mr. José Sosa (Dominican\r\nRepublic), Mr. Kai Sauer (Finland), Mr. Gebhard\r\nKandanga (Namibia), Mr. Faisal Al-Athba\r\n(Qatar) and Mr. Pavlo Orel (Ukraine) acted as\r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nI now suspend the meeting for thirty minutes.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 12.25 p.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A —  African and Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 183\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 183\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 182\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 122\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nAngola 181\r\nPakistan 172\r\nIndia 1\r\nGroup B —  Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 183\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 183\r\nAbstentions: 5\r\nNumber of members voting: 178\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 119\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nChile 178\r\nGroup C —  Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 183\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 183\r\nAbstentions 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 183\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 122\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nGermany 180\r\nSpain 180\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority,\r\nthe following States were elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council for a two-year term beginning 1\r\nJanuary 2003: Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan\r\nand Spain.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have\r\nbeen elected members of the Security Council.\r\nI would also like to thank the tellers for their\r\nassistance in the election.\r\nWe have thus concluded our consideration of sub-\r\nitem (a) of agenda item 15.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.20\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof the General Assembly to document A/INF/57/3,\r\nwhich contains a tentative programme of work and\r\nschedule of plenary meetings for the period from\r\n27 September to 10 December 2002 and which has\r\nbeen distributed in the Hall.\r\nI should also like to remind members that the list\r\nof speakers for items listed  in document  A/INF/57/3\r\nare open.
