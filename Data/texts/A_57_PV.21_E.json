The ballot papers reflect\r\nthis pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those\r\ncandidates, their number not exceeding the number of\r\nseats to be filled, who receive the greatest number of\r\nvotes and a two-thirds majority of members present and\r\nvoting, will be declared elected. In the case of a tie\r\nvote for a remaining seat, there will be a restricted\r\nballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an\r\nequal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to\r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the\r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret\r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by\r\nthe Chairman of the respective regional groups that for\r\nthe five vacant seats from among the African States,\r\nthere are five endorsed candidates, namely Benin, the\r\nCongo, Kenya, Mozambique and Senegal.\r\nFor the three vacant seats from among the Asian\r\nStates, there are five candidates, namely Japan,\r\nLebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia and Saudi Arabia.\r\nFor the one vacant seat from among the Eastern\r\nEuropean States, there is one endorsed candidate,\r\nnamely Azerbaijan.\r\nFor the four vacant seats from among the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, there are four\r\nendorsed candidates, namely Cuba, Ecuador, Jamaica\r\nand Nicaragua.\r\nFor the five vacant seats from among the Western\r\nEuropean and other States, there are five endorsed\r\ncandidates, namely France, Germany, Greece, Ireland\r\nand Portugal.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, we shall now proceed to the election by\r\nsecret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like\r\nto remind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the\r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly, no\r\nrepresentative shall interrupt the voting except on a\r\npoint of order on the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the\r\nelection. Please be reminded that, during the voting\r\nprocess, all campaigning should cease in the General\r\nAssembly Hall. This means in particular that, once the\r\nvoting has begun, no more campaign material can be\r\ndistributed inside the Hall. All representatives are also\r\nrequested to remain at their seats so that the voting\r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.21\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E”\r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use\r\nonly those ballot papers and to write on them the\r\nnames of States for which they wish to vote.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot\r\npapers marked “A” for the African States the names of\r\nthe five States for which they wish to vote, on the\r\nballot papers marked “B” for the Asian States the\r\nnames of the three States for which they vote, on the\r\nballot papers marked “C” for the Eastern European\r\nStates the name of the one State for which they wish to\r\nvote, on the ballot papers marked “D” for the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States the names of the four\r\nStates for which they wish to vote and on the ballot\r\npapers marked “E” for the Western European and other\r\nStates the names of the five States for which they wish\r\nto vote.\r\nA ballot paper containing more names from the\r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it\r\nwill be declared invalid.
