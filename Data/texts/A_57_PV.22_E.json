(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 44 and agenda item 10 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/270 and\r\nA/57/270/Corr.1)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/57/1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nSecretary-General presented his report to the General\r\nAssembly at the 2nd plenary meeting, on 12 September\r\n2002.\r\nI now give the floor to the Secretary-General to\r\npresent his report on the implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Let met begin by\r\nthanking you, Mr. President, for giving me this\r\nopportunity to present to the Assembly the first of my\r\nannual reports on progress achieved by the United\r\nNations system and Member States towards\r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration. I shall do so\r\nbriefly, because I believe the report speaks for itself. In\r\nfact I cannot do better than repeat to you what I wrote\r\nin the concluding chapter:\r\n“The record of the international community\r\nin the first two years of implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration is, at best, mixed. Some\r\nMillennium goals have benefited from the hard\r\ndecisions and courageous reforms that are\r\nneeded. Others have not. In the remaining 13\r\nyears, progress must be made on a much broader\r\nfront. Otherwise, the ringing words of the\r\nDeclaration will serve only as grim reminders of\r\nhuman needs neglected and promises unmet.”\r\n(A/57/270, para. 113)\r\nAt a time when grave decisions have to be taken\r\nabout threats to international peace and security, and\r\nthe best way to deal with them, some of us may be\r\ntempted to put the broader and longer-term agenda of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration on the back burner. I\r\nimplore you to resist that temptation. Nothing, indeed,\r\ncould be more contrary to the spirit of the United\r\nNations and its Charter, in which the goal of saving\r\nfuture generations from the scourge of war is so closely\r\nlinked to that of promoting social progress and better\r\nstandards of life in larger freedom.\r\nThe United Nations must be able to confront\r\nimmediate threats to peace and security without\r\nslackening its efforts on behalf of those who struggle to\r\nsurvive on less than $1 a day, without clean water or\r\nsanitation, and go to bed hungry every night.\r\nWe cannot afford to treat the Millennium\r\nDeclaration as something to think about tomorrow, or\r\nwhenever the pressure of business permits. Let us not\r\nforget that our heads of State or Government adopted it\r\nas an urgent agenda — a list of the things we cannot\r\nneglect and most urgently need to change if this new\r\ncentury is to be any better than the last.\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nYet at present we are falling short. What this\r\nreport shows is that, if we carry on the way we are,\r\nmost of the pledges made in the Declaration are not\r\ngoing to be fulfilled.\r\nOn all our broad objectives — human rights,\r\ndemocracy, good governance, the resolution of\r\nconflicts and the special needs of Africa — we are\r\nmoving too slowly. Unless we can speed things up\r\ndramatically, we shall find when we get to 2015 that\r\nthe words of the Declaration ring hollow.\r\nOn progress towards the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals — the targets which are most\r\nprecise, and therefore easiest to measure — there are\r\nmarked differences between regions.\r\nOver the past decade, East Asia has already\r\nhalved the proportion of people living on $1 or less per\r\nday — from 28 per cent to 14 per cent. South Asia,\r\nwhere nearly half the world’s poor still live, has seen a\r\nmore modest drop, from 44 per cent to 37 per cent.\r\nBut in Africa, where 10 years ago, 48 per cent of\r\nthe people were living on $1 a day or less, the figure\r\ntoday is 47 per cent. In 10 years, Africa has managed\r\nto cut the proportion only by one forty-eighth. There\r\nwill have to be a dramatic change if by 2015 — only\r\njust over 12 years from now — it is going to be cut by\r\n50 per cent, as we have promised.\r\nThe first big test of the Millennium commitment\r\nwill come in 2005 — little more than two years from\r\nnow — by which time Member States hope to have\r\nachieved parity of girls and boys in primary and\r\nsecondary schools. I regret to say that it is unlikely to\r\nbe met. Between 1990 and 2000, the gender gap\r\nnarrowed only by 25 per cent. And without greater\r\nsuccess in placing more girls in school, I fear it will\r\nprove even more difficult to reach the other goals.\r\nThe Millennium Goals are global, but what will\r\ndetermine whether they are or are not met is what\r\nhappens in each separate country. And there is no\r\nmagic formula for reaching them that every country\r\ncan apply. Each country must find the right mix of\r\npolicies — one that suits its local conditions — and the\r\npeople of each country must insist that those policies\r\nbe applied.\r\nLet no one think that this applies only to\r\ndeveloping countries. The developed countries, too,\r\nmust ensure that no part of their own population falls\r\nshort of the Millennium Development Goals. And they\r\nalso have a special global responsibility. They must\r\ndeliver what they have promised: to open their markets\r\nfully to the products of developing countries; to let\r\nthem compete in the global market on fair terms; and to\r\nprovide much more generous development assistance.\r\nWithout these things, many developing countries will\r\nbe unable to reach the Millennium Goals, however hard\r\nthey try. In other words, it is not here at the United\r\nNations or by the work of United Nations officials that\r\nthese Goals can be achieved. They have to be achieved\r\nin each of the countries that are represented here, by\r\nthe efforts of its Government and its people.\r\nThat is why I have started a millennium campaign\r\nto make the Goals better known throughout the world\r\nand to try and mobilize the force of public opinion\r\nbehind them. I shall deliver my annual global report to\r\nthe General Assembly each year, but I hope that every\r\ndeveloping country, with the help of the United Nations\r\nand other international institutions, will also produce\r\nits own annual report so that, in each country, the\r\npeople will know how they are doing. Our hope is that,\r\nin this age of democracy, once people know, they will\r\ninsist on action.\r\nWith the Declaration, the road map, the\r\nMillennium Development Goals and the decisions\r\ntaken this year in Monterrey and Johannesburg, we\r\nnow have an impressive corpus of international\r\ncommitments, all brought together in a single coherent\r\nvision on which all Member States agree.\r\nThis vision can become a reality only if all those\r\nwho have a stake in it play their due part. As I have\r\njust said, the decisive action must be taken within and\r\nby each Member State, but the international\r\ncommunity, and the United Nations in particular, also\r\nhave an enormous collective stake in the outcome. We\r\nmust all do our part to ensure that the necessary action\r\nreally happens, and I personally am fully committed to\r\ndo so.\r\nThis Assembly, which is the most authentic\r\nrepresentative of the international community as a\r\nwhole, has an especially important role to play and,\r\nhere and now, an important procedural decision to take.\r\nLet me urge representatives to follow this process with\r\nvigour, but also in an integrated fashion. The\r\nMillennium Declaration has given us a big picture. We\r\nmust not allow that picture to be fragmented and dealt\r\nwith piecemeal by different processes in different\r\ncommittees. We need to keep the whole of it firmly in\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nview. Mr. President, I leave that important issue in your\r\ncapable hands.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: Today, we open our first joint\r\ndebate on two very important agenda items: the work\r\nof the Organization and the follow-up to the outcome\r\nof the Millennium Summit. Let me first express my\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\nintroduction of both reports and especially for his\r\ndetermination to pursue the goals of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Both reports are comprehensive yet\r\nconcise, and provide a very good basis for our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nMore than ever, the call for multilateralism in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security\r\nresonates through the Organization. The joint\r\nconcentration of Member States on the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism produced some results\r\nthroughout the past year. It is necessary, however, to\r\ncommit ourselves to further strengthening the United\r\nNations legal framework, including a renewed effort to\r\nnegotiate the comprehensive convention against\r\nterrorism.\r\nDespite some positive developments, we have\r\nwitnessed growing tensions and the escalation of\r\nconflicts in many parts of the world. To be more\r\neffective in the area of peacekeeping, we must continue\r\nto implement its reform measures, including enhancing\r\nrapid deployment capabilities, taking action on lessons\r\nlearned and generating sufficient resources, to name\r\njust a few.\r\nOur efforts should, however, first and foremost\r\nconcentrate on preventing conflicts before they arise.\r\nThe recently increased attention to the concept of\r\nprevention of armed conflict is therefore proper. The\r\nUnited Nations can contribute through effective and\r\ntimely use of the existing preventive tools, such as\r\nearly warning systems, mediation and political\r\nguidance, good offices, fact-finding and goodwill\r\nmissions, or preventive deployment and disarmament.\r\nEqually important are policy advice and\r\ndevelopment cooperation in the areas that are crucial\r\nfor conflict prevention, such as good governance,\r\ncapacity-building and poverty eradication. I believe\r\nthat the resumption of the work, on the initiative of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, in drafting the draft resolution on\r\nconflict prevention will ensure that this topic remains\r\nhigh on the agenda of the current session. I do hope\r\nthat, during our presidency, we will be able to reach a\r\nconsensus on that important draft resolution. We will\r\ndefinitely not spare our energy to achieve this goal.\r\nDuring the fifty-seventh session, I am particularly\r\ndetermined to devote special attention to the issue of\r\nthe coordinated and integrated follow-up of the\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations international\r\nconferences of the past decade, especially the\r\nMillennium Summit and the Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg summits. I am convinced that such an\r\napproach will yield a positive and effective input to a\r\nmore coherent and relevant review of the\r\nimplementation of those conferences. In this respect, I\r\nrely on Members’ support and active participation in\r\nthe work of the plenary and Main Committees that will\r\nresult in a synergy of different views to formulate a\r\nholistic approach to the follow-up of the conferences.\r\nAllow me to add a few comments on the report on\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nreport provides a good overview of the\r\naccomplishments and shortcomings on the road\r\ntowards attaining the millennium goals. The report\r\nconcludes that sufficient progress has been achieved in\r\na few countries only and that prospects for meeting the\r\nMillennium Development Goals are, at best, mixed. I\r\nhope that our debate will help us to identify gaps and to\r\nformulate strategies for the future, as spelled out in the\r\nresolution 55/162.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals became the\r\nbasis of the economic and social policy of the United\r\nNations and international development cooperation.\r\nTheir implementation must remain our top priority.\r\nNow, with the first report on the implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration presented, it is\r\ntime to engage ourselves in the search for the most\r\neffective approach in the follow-up mechanism,\r\nformulating a set of requirements for the monitoring\r\nand review of the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals to ensure due results at the due\r\ntime.\r\nWe have to keep in mind that the credibility of\r\nthe United Nations is based not only on its ability to\r\narticulate political goals but also — and primarily —\r\non its ability to mobilize the political will for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nMr. Manis (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is our\r\npleasure to thank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nhaving responded to General Assembly resolutions by\r\nissuing these two important reports (A/57/1 and\r\nA/57/270 and A/57/270/Corr.1) to set out for Member\r\nStates the vision, and status of the implementation, of\r\ndeclared commitments.\r\nThe international community and the peoples of\r\nthe world celebrated the Assembly’s adoption of the\r\nMillennium Declaration at the end of 2000. It was a\r\nunique and historic event setting out goals and\r\napproaches. It outlined how we were to meet the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, such as\r\neconomic and social underdevelopment, extreme\r\npoverty, deadly diseases such as AIDS, malaria and\r\ntuberculosis, and other important challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security such as terrorism,\r\norganized crime and armed conflicts. The Declaration\r\nalso called for necessary attention to be given to the\r\nvery important issue of the reform of the Organization,\r\nwhich is the principal mechanism for carrying out the\r\nactivities, efforts and programmes of the international\r\ncommunity in the interest of its peoples.\r\nOne of the most important and needed reforms —\r\nand on which tangible progress has not been made\r\nsince the Millennium Summit — is Security Council\r\nreform, including the expansion of its permanent and\r\nnon-permanent membership in order to make the\r\nCouncil more representative of the United Nations\r\nmembership. The Council’s working methods should\r\nalso be reformed in order to make Council resolutions\r\nmore democratic and transparent. It is regrettable to\r\nnote that the Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform has held meetings since January 1994 without\r\nmaking any significant progress.\r\nThe challenge facing us today is to turn\r\nglobalization into a positive force and to use\r\ninformation technology in the service of development.\r\nHowever, we note that the gap between the countries of\r\nthe North and of the South is continually widening and\r\nthat the ongoing digital divide reflects the utter failure\r\nof international and regional policies in the fields of\r\ndevelopment cooperation and assistance. In spite of the\r\nmany international conferences held, in particular the\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg conferences, the gap\r\nbetween the rich and the poor is still widening. We\r\nurgently need to establish an international economic\r\nsystem that is more democratic and just and which\r\ngrants poor countries preferential conditions for trade\r\nwith rich countries, in addition to an increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance and external debt relief for\r\npoor countries.\r\nWe would like to welcome the purely African\r\ninitiative of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment and the General Assembly’s decision,\r\ntaken last month, to support it. We also welcome the\r\nfinal review of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s, which should lead\r\nto a willingness on the part of the international\r\ncommunity to assist the African continent, in\r\naccordance with General Assembly resolutions.\r\nThe social and economic situation of the least\r\ndeveloped countries requires that the international\r\ncommunity give special and serious attention to those\r\ncountries in order to help them defeat poverty, hunger\r\nand disease. In that respect, we call for the\r\nimplementation of the Brussels Programme of Action.\r\nWe would like to draw attention to the\r\nAssembly’s decision to establish the Office of the High\r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries,\r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island\r\nDeveloping States as a follow-up mechanism to\r\nimplement the Programme of Action for the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries. We hope that the High\r\nRepresentative will receive the support he needs to\r\ncarry out his duties.\r\nMeasures to improve the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations require our full\r\nattention and support. In this regard, we welcome the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations system through an agenda for further\r\nchange. We support that report (A/57/387) and the\r\nideas and initiatives that it contains to better enable the\r\nOrganization to effectively face new challenges and to\r\nrespond to the aspirations of all peoples.\r\nWe pay tribute to the success achieved by United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Sierra\r\nLeone, Timor-Leste and Afghanistan. We welcome the\r\nsubstantial cooperation and coordination between the\r\nOrganization and other relevant bodies. We look\r\nforward to the report that the Secretary-General has\r\npromised on the introduction of programme and\r\ninstitutional improvements to make the Millennium\r\nDeclaration an instrument that is real, easy to\r\nimplement and that achieves concrete results.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that\r\nfundamental human rights, economic, social and\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\ncultural rights and basic freedoms form an integral\r\nwhole. Human rights can be realized only through the\r\nelimination of poverty and the improvement of\r\neconomies. In that regard, we affirm our rejection of\r\nselectivity, double standards and the politicization of\r\nhuman rights issues. We call for providing the\r\nresources necessary to enable countries to deal with\r\ntheir problems without prior conditions or ulterior\r\nmotives. We welcome the outcome of the Durban\r\nConference against Racism. We hope that the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, through the necessary financing,\r\nwill lead to tangible results.\r\nWe value the quick United Nations response to\r\nthe events of 11 September 2001 and the adoption of\r\ndecisive resolutions to combat international terrorism.\r\nAfter devoting an entire week to consideration of that\r\nissue, the General Assembly adopted resolution 56/1 by\r\nconsensus. The Counter-Terrorism Committee was\r\nestablished pursuant to Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001). The international community has\r\nresponded expeditiously to all calls to combat\r\nterrorism, but many States have also called for an\r\ninternational conference to be held to define terrorism\r\nand to distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate\r\nrights of peoples to self-defence in confronting external\r\naggression. Sudan has condemned terrorism in all its\r\nforms and has cooperated with all international efforts\r\nto combat it. We have ratified 11 relevant conventions,\r\nand we look forward to a definition of terrorism that\r\nwill help us achieve all United Nations initiatives.\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for the reports we have received.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s mixed feelings\r\nabout the Organization’s achievements and the current\r\nworld situation. Indeed, during the past year, we noted\r\nwith satisfaction important progress in the fight against\r\ninternational impunity with the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). There has also\r\nbeen progress in landmine eradication and in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, the Security Council having\r\nestablished a committee on that issue. There has also\r\nbeen progress in humanitarian assistance and a better\r\norganized effort to cope with natural disasters. But, like\r\nthe Secretary-General, we also believe that much\r\nremains to be done to achieve a world free of threats,\r\nviolence and poverty.\r\nThe Secretary-General reminds us of the deep\r\ndisparity that exists between the logic of disarmament\r\nand the logic of development. Worldwide, $839 billion\r\nis spent annually on military expenditures, while\r\nofficial development assistance amounts to only $51\r\nbillion a year. The international community could\r\neliminate the $70 billion deficit in financing the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals by\r\n2015 just by reducing annual military expenditures by\r\nless than 10 per cent.\r\nIn our view, that situation is an aberration. The\r\nmajor threats to international security today are\r\ngenerated by the asymmetrical conflict created by\r\ninternational terrorism, transnational crime and drug\r\ntrafficking. Similarly, world stability is continuously\r\nthreatened by extreme poverty, environmental\r\ndeterioration, global warming and the economic\r\nstagnation of the majority of the countries referred to\r\nas developing countries; in the past decade only 17\r\nsuch countries have achieved growth of 5 per cent,\r\nwhich is the minimum expected to reduce poverty.\r\nSometimes we wonder why most of the countries of\r\nthis Organization are referred to as developing\r\ncountries when they are not developing; they continue\r\nto be underdeveloped. Therefore, controlling that\r\nproblem should be one of the main goals of this\r\nOrganization.\r\nSimilarly, we believe that the situation will not be\r\ncorrected by increasing military budgets, nuclear\r\nsystems and sophisticated conventional weapons.\r\nThat is unrealistic. Not exempt from this appraisal are\r\nthe underdeveloped States, which maintain\r\ndisproportionately large armies and become mired in\r\narms races, though they are faced with virtually non-\r\nexistent prospects of war. Many such countries shirk\r\ntheir most basic responsibilities to guarantee\r\ndemocratic, free and just societies.\r\nFor those reasons, Peru has reduced its military\r\nbudget by 20 per cent and has been promoting concrete\r\ninitiatives in South America aimed at addressing that\r\nreality, such as the recent adoption of the Andean\r\nCharter for Peace and Security and the creation of a\r\nSouth American zone of peace and cooperation, by\r\nwhich we propose to reduce military expenditures in\r\norder to redirect them to the fight against poverty and\r\nsocial development. There is also the initiative to\r\nnegotiate a reduction in the number of missiles in Latin\r\nAmerica, as well as to strengthen confidence-building\r\nmeasures and transparency mechanisms in Latin\r\nAmerica\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nIn Peru’s view, that type of initiative, which we\r\nhope can be reproduced in other regions, is fully in\r\nkeeping with the creation of a culture of peace and\r\nwhat is called structural prevention, based specifically\r\non the need to resolve political, economic and social\r\nfactors that contribute to the emergence of violent\r\nconflicts.\r\nThe great development challenge we face is to\r\ncreate societies where democracy, the rule of law,\r\nrespect for human rights, social solidarity and\r\nindividual prosperity prevail. Latin America has made\r\ngreat progress in consolidating democracy and the rule\r\nof law. However, it faces a very critical economic and\r\nsocial situation today. As the reports of the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank point\r\nout, our region not only has the lowest economic\r\ngrowth rates of all regions of the world, it is also faced\r\nwith an ongoing systemic and financial crisis.\r\nThat situation not only threatens to spread and\r\naggravate poverty in the countries of Latin America, it\r\nalso threatens to erode our effort to attain the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Worse still is that the\r\nsituation is also eroding democratic governance, while\r\nour citizens call for concrete results in the economic\r\nand social fields from democratic Governments. We\r\nmust, therefore, understand that strong democratic\r\ngovernance requires economic strength and stability,\r\nand the only way to address growing social demands,\r\nunemployment and acute poverty is through healthy\r\ngrowth, with social equity among our economies.\r\nTherefore, the time has come to find a way to\r\nfinance the defence of democratic governance. For that\r\nreason, Peru has proposed to the international\r\ncommunity in various forums the need to create\r\ninnovative financing mechanisms that will enable us to\r\nstrengthen democratic governance. We need to\r\nestablish international mechanisms that will enable us\r\nto close the gap between social demands faced by\r\ndemocratic Governments, particularly demands that\r\ncall on society to produce concrete results for people’s\r\nwell-being. Results will be seen later through the\r\neconomic policies pursued that encourage investment,\r\ntrade and the development of our markets. What is at\r\nissue specifically is defending the enormous efforts\r\nachieved in building democracy and macroeconomic\r\nstability. We have thus asked the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean to\r\nprepare a study about possible mechanisms of a new\r\narchitecture for the international financial system in\r\norder to support democratic governance. The United\r\nNations Development Programme is also examining\r\nfuture measures to that end. We hope that the next\r\nreport of the Secretary-General will include innovative\r\nideas on this crucial issue faced by Latin America.\r\nI wish to conclude by expressing the firm\r\nconviction of Peru that the strengthening of the United\r\nNations and the effective performance of its functions\r\nare fundamental in seeking cooperative responses to\r\ninternational crises and problems. Consequently, we\r\nsupport the appeal of the Secretary-General to continue\r\nstrengthening multilateralism as the sole strategic\r\noption in the endeavours of States.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): In presenting\r\nhis report (A/57/1) on the work of the Organization on\r\n12 September, the Secretary-General made a strong\r\nappeal for multilateralism. That might seem surprising\r\nbefore an audience that should epitomize the spirit of\r\nmultilateralism. But while the international community\r\nindeed rallied in a forceful and unprecedented manner\r\nto respond to the attacks of 11 September, the promise\r\ncontained in our coming together quickly faded and\r\nwas replaced by old patterns of confrontation and\r\nunilateral action. To our mind, the rule of law has\r\nbecome a predominant theme over the past few months.\r\nThis Organization, and the Security Council in\r\nparticular, is challenged to live up to its role as the\r\nguardian of the rule of law.\r\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding the\r\nInternational Criminal Court took on an unfortunate\r\nnew dimension when the Security Council adopted its\r\nresolution 1422 (2002) last summer. We remain\r\nconvinced that the functions and powers of the Security\r\nCouncil do not encompass the com petence to alter or\r\ninterpret international treaties. We are also concerned\r\nthat such action outside the mandate given by the\r\nCharter could weaken the political credibility of the\r\nCouncil in the long run.\r\nGiven that the Council acts on behalf of the entire\r\nmembership, and in the light of the enormous\r\nchallenges it is facing, the legitimacy and thus the\r\npolitical credibility of the Council are of the utmost\r\nimportance. I would like to reiterate at this juncture\r\nthat my Government remains fully committed to\r\npreserving the integrity of the Rome Statute which\r\nentered into force on 1 July.\r\nThe international rule of law is in particular at\r\nstake when it comes to the use of armed force. While\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nthe discussions of the past few weeks have been cause\r\nfor some concern, they still made one thing abundantly\r\nclear. The legitimacy provided by a decision of the\r\nSecurity Council is unique indeed, and that legitimacy\r\nis necessary to ensure that armed intervention, where\r\ninevitable, enjoys the support of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nImplementation, of course, is the other element\r\nthat is decisive for credibility. Resolutions of the\r\nCouncil are legally binding on all Member States, and\r\nthe implementation of all Council decisions must be\r\nensured. In this context, the use of armed force should\r\nbe considered only as a last resort in cases where non-\r\ncompliance clearly poses a threat to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) is the\r\ncentral element of the quick and determined response\r\nof the United Nations to the threat posed by\r\ninternational terrorism. The work of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee illustrates in many ways how the\r\nUnited Nations works at its best and how the rule of\r\nlaw is essential to guarantee human security.\r\nThat same rule of law must also prevail in our\r\ndealing with individuals suspected of involvement in\r\nterrorist activities. Basic standards of human rights,\r\nwhich constitute one of the great achievements of the\r\nUnited Nations, have to be observed at all times. It\r\nwould be a grave mistake to treat human rights, a\r\n“bedrock requirement for the realization of the\r\nCharter’s vision” (A/57/387, para. 45), to quote the\r\nSecretary-General, as a luxury which we can afford\r\nduring good times and dispense with in times of crisis\r\nsuch as those created by international terrorism. Rather,\r\nthey constitute the foundation upon which our actions\r\nmust be based.\r\nMy remarks so far have focused on the Security\r\nCouncil because its activities during the past year have\r\nhad such a strong impact. But much of what I have said\r\nleads me to conclude that this body, the General\r\nAssembly, has to play a stronger role. We are therefore\r\nsatisfied to see that both the new reform proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General — an agenda for further change\r\n(A/57/387) — and the priorities for your term in office,\r\nMr. President, contain a call for a stronger General\r\nAssembly. The implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration offers an ideal opportunity for the General\r\nAssembly to assert its place as the only universal organ\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations is about to enter\r\nan era of implementation and application of the agreed\r\nstandards and goals, many of which are a result of the\r\nmajor conferences of the past decade. We do\r\nindeed feel the “summit fatigue” (A/57/357, para. 24)\r\nmentioned by the Secretary-General in his reform\r\nreport. The standards are clear. Ambitious goals have\r\nbeen set, and our work should now focus on\r\nimplementation.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals must\r\nconstitute the centre of our efforts in that respect. The\r\nroad map given to us by the Secretary-General offers\r\nclear guidance for the implementation process which,\r\nafter the conferences of Monterrey and Johannesburg,\r\nwhich were complementary in many respects, must be\r\ntackled with renewed vigour and political will.\r\nWe appreciate the overview on progress achieved\r\ngiven to us by the Secretary-General, in particular the\r\nemphasis placed on the two themes designated for this\r\nyear: conflict prevention and the prevention of major\r\ndiseases. On conflict prevention, it is not too surprising\r\nto note that the necessary change of mindset has not yet\r\ntaken place, and that political and material support for\r\npreventive efforts has not been very forthcoming. Since\r\nthe change from response to prevention constitutes a\r\ntrue paradigm shift, and given the often elusive\r\ncharacter of preventive efforts, it will only be after a\r\nlearning process that prevention will take its rightful\r\nplace as foreseen in the Charter of the Organization.\r\nWe will continue to give our full political support to\r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to create a culture\r\nof prevention.\r\nIn the area of fighting diseases, HIV/AIDS\r\ncontinues to be at the forefront of our concerns, and the\r\ninformation available does not indicate a reversal of\r\ntrends since the adoption of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment last year (resolution S-26/2). The\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS was a good example of\r\nhow the quick succession of major United Nations\r\nmeetings can have a negative impact on follow-up and\r\nimplementation activities. The Declaration of\r\nCommitment is a bold text and would constitute an\r\nefficient tool to combat the pandemic if applied and\r\nimplemented at the national and international levels.\r\nWe therefore hope that the General Assembly will\r\ndevote special attention to the follow-up activities,\r\nespecially since 2003 is already the first target year\r\ncontained in the Declaration.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals are\r\nvisionary and are subject to a lengthy process. We must\r\nensure that our record on implementation is very soon\r\nmore positive than mixed at best.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, I should like to express my sincere thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for the report on the Organization’s\r\nactivities (A/57/1) as well as his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration\r\n(A/57/270), adopted in September 2000 by the United\r\nNations. While the former report provides an\r\naccounting of what has been undertaken in the various\r\nareas of the Organization’s activity during the past\r\nyear, the latter endeavours to recount the progress\r\nachieved and the problems encountered over the past\r\ntwo years in implementing the commitments\r\nundertaken under the various chapters of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. It is therefore evident that\r\nboth reports are linked in terms of their contents, which\r\njustifies their being considered in the same debate.\r\nClearly, the breadth and the diversity of the\r\nOrganization’s activities — which both of the reports\r\npresent in exhaustive detail — and the limited time that\r\nhas been accorded us for today’s debate do not permit\r\nus to address in detail all the activities undertaken by\r\nthe Organization in the past year. Since we will soon\r\nhave the opportunity to consider some extremely\r\nimportant points before the Assembly — such as those\r\ntouching on the reforms of the Organization and the\r\nrevitalization of the Assembly — I shall confine my\r\ncomments to certain areas of the Organization’s\r\nactivities that are of major importance to my\r\ndelegation.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September have given new impetus to the\r\nOrganization’s anti-terrorism activities aimed at giving\r\neffect to concerted measures to fight terrorism, in\r\nconformity with the commitments undertaken by States\r\nMembers in the Millennium Declaration. However,\r\nwhile one welcomes the international community’s\r\nawakening to the dangers that terrorism represents for\r\nhumanity as a transnational phenomenon and as a\r\nthreat to international peace and security — as well as\r\nto the measures taken by the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council to prevent and to combat terrorism —\r\nit is still true that much remains to be done. I am\r\nspeaking here of concrete actions to eradicate that\r\ndevastating scourge.\r\nThe United Nations must, first of all, pursue its\r\nefforts to urge Member States to ratify the 12\r\ninternational conventions against terrorism and to\r\nfinalize the negotiations on the two draft conventions,\r\nin particular the draft comprehensive convention\r\nagainst terrorism. We also hope that the General\r\nAssembly, at the level of both the Third Committee and\r\nthe Fifth Committee, can adopt during this session the\r\nproposals of the Secretary-General contained in his\r\nreport (A/57/152) dated 2 July 2002 on strengthening\r\nthe Terrorism Prevention Branch of the Secretariat.\r\nFinally, subregional, regional and international anti-\r\nterrorism cooperation — to which all States say they\r\nare attached — should become a tangible reality so that\r\nthe States that face terrorism have at their disposal the\r\nnecessary means to combat it.\r\nNow more than ever, the United Nations needs\r\nincreased capacity and means to realize its potential for\r\nconflict prevention. Experience has shown that the\r\neffective and swift prevention of conflicts is clearly\r\nmore effective and less costly for the Organization in\r\nhuman and financial terms than peacekeeping or peace-\r\nbuilding operations. We subscribe to the idea expressed\r\nby the Secretary-General that\r\n“the international conflict management system\r\ncan and must invest in capacities for structural\r\nand operational prevention at all levels, from\r\nlocal to national, from regional to\r\ninternational ....” (A/57/270, para. 32)\r\nWhile it is true that success in conflict prevention is\r\ndifficult to measure, that does not make such success\r\nany less important. The events of 11 September\r\nreminded us of that reality in a brutal and tragic way.\r\nIn the area of peacekeeping, the United Nations\r\nhas benefited in the past two years from an extremely\r\nimportant contribution of financial, human and\r\nlogistical resources. First of all, the scale of\r\nassessments for the peacekeeping operations budget\r\nwas reformed in December 2000, making it possible to\r\nmeet financing needs, which reached a volume\r\nunprecedented in the Organization’s history — nearly\r\n$2.8 billion — in the past budgetary year. Then, in the\r\ncontext of the Brahimi report (A/55/305), the\r\nmanagement and planning capacities of the Department\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations were strengthened with the\r\ncreation of more than 200 new posts. And finally, last\r\nJune the General Assembly approved the\r\nimplementation of the concept of strategic deployment\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nstocks, enabling the Secretariat to set up a reserve of\r\nstores to support a complex mission at the United\r\nNations Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy, for the rapid\r\ndeployment of a mission within 30 to 90 days.\r\nNevertheless, we continue to think that\r\nharmonious and orderly implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Brahimi report, and those of\r\nthe Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations,\r\nessentially requires establishing better coordination\r\namong the various actors and increasing the\r\neffectiveness of the planning and management of\r\npeacekeeping operations by recruiting highly qualified\r\npersonnel, including for missions in the field. It is also\r\nessential to strengthen United Nations assistance to\r\nregional organs so that they can fulfil their\r\nresponsibilities, particularly with regard to conflict\r\nprevention and peacekeeping in their respective\r\ngeographic spheres. In that connection, we hope that\r\nthe envisaged revision and redefinition of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union will\r\ngive new impetus to the collaboration between those\r\norganizations.\r\nThe wide scope of the humanitarian problems\r\ngenerated by situations of war or natural disaster that\r\ntoday affect vast regions of the world — in particular\r\nnumerous developing countries — shows that it is\r\nindispensable and urgent that we strengthen the means\r\navailable to the United Nations to react swiftly and\r\neffectively, with a view to ensuring that we meet the\r\nvital needs of civilian populations, particularly\r\nvulnerable persons such as women and children. In\r\nAfrica, persistent humanitarian crises linked to\r\nconflict, famine, natural disasters, especially drought,\r\nand the spread of infectious diseases, particularly\r\nHIV/AIDS, challenge the human conscience and\r\nrequire effective measures to be taken at the level of\r\nthe United Nations system with a view to finding a\r\nlasting solution. So that it may play its full role in the\r\nhumanitarian area, the United Nations must put in\r\nplace mechanisms to coordinate aid among the various\r\nhumanitarian bodies and institutions, which then must\r\nact in partnership to negotiate access, to mobilize\r\nresources and to furnish common services, such as\r\naerial transport and communications.\r\nFurthermore, although it is true that it is up to the\r\nconcerned countries themselves to tackle problems\r\nrelated to internally displaced populations, it is no less\r\nnecessary that policies and mechanisms agreed upon by\r\nintergovernmental organs be established at the United\r\nNations level to help address, in a concerted manner\r\nand at the request of concerned States, the problems of\r\ndisplaced civilians, whose growing number — more\r\nthan 50 million worldwide in 2001 — is becoming\r\nincreasingly disturbing. Despite the improvement seen\r\nin 2001 after the repatriation of 700,000 refugees to\r\ntheir countries of origin, the refugee situation remains\r\nworrisome — particularly in Africa, which still has\r\nmore than 5 million refugees. The situation is even\r\nmore disturbing in the light of the acts of violence and\r\nsexual exploitation committed against women and\r\nchildren by humanitarian personnel or by members of\r\npeacekeeping missions, particularly in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and in West Africa — serious allegations\r\nthat are currently the subject of an investigation by the\r\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services.\r\nTurning to the field of international economic\r\ncooperation, we vest great hope in the effective\r\nimplementation of the commitments undertaken at the\r\nMonterrey Conference on Financing for Development,\r\nthe Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the DOHA Ministerial Conference in\r\norder to overcome those obstacles that stand in the way\r\nof economic growth and sustainable development of\r\nthe developing countries, and thus to achieve the\r\nobjectives of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nparticularly to halve, by 2015, poverty and famine\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThis is the context of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) initiative, which aims\r\nto set Africa on the way to sustainable development\r\nand to integrate it into the global economy. That being\r\nso, the support of the international community and in\r\nparticular of the United Nations system is more than\r\never necessary for the success of this initiative, which\r\nwas launched by the Africans themselves, and also to\r\nrespond to the specific needs of Africa as set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nIn order effectively to implement NEPAD, it is\r\nessential to adapt United Nations programmes to the\r\nNEPAD approach, to promote intersectoral coherence\r\nand to bring about, under the authority of the Chief\r\nExecutives Board for Coordination, enhanced\r\ncoordination between the agencies and bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations system in order to share tasks and avoid\r\nduplication and overlapping.\r\nThus we attach particular importance to the\r\nupcoming regional meeting of the United Nations\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\ninstitutions, to be held at Addis Ababa, particularly in\r\nterms of dealing with certain weaknesses and\r\nshortcomings in matters of coordination. We would like\r\nalso to see some account taken of the recommendation\r\nof the Committee for Programme and Coordination,\r\nwhich was approved by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil at its substantive session last July, emphasizing\r\nthe need for the United Nations system to define a\r\nstrategic operational framework that will provide\r\nsupport for the implementation of NEPAD — a\r\nframework that should identify problems, spell out\r\nobjectives, define the role to be played by the various\r\norganizations, set out resource needs and, finally,\r\nintroduce achievement indicators.\r\nThe modest results of the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, as set out in the annual report\r\nof the Secretary-General, should encourage States\r\nMembers of the United Nations to redouble their\r\nefforts to give significant impetus particularly to those\r\nactivities connected with priority areas in which little\r\nprogress, unfortunately, has been made. It is our hope\r\nthat the breakthroughs that have been seen in certain\r\nfields will be consolidated by 2005, and that, when the\r\nSecretary-General presents his overall five-year report\r\non the implementation of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nfurther success will have been achieved under all of the\r\nheadings of the Declaration.\r\nMr. McIvor (New Zealand): Sir, let me first offer\r\nmy delegation’s congratulations on your election as\r\nPresident of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. We look forward to working with you over\r\nthe coming months.\r\nMy delegation will address particularly the\r\nsecond item in this joint debate — that is, the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the work of the Organization.\r\nBefore doing so, however, I would like to comment\r\nbriefly on one of the key issues identified in the\r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Summit.\r\nThe challenge of humanitarian intervention has\r\nlong been on the agenda of the United Nations. We\r\nwelcome the report of the International Commission on\r\nIntervention and State Sovereignty, entitled “The\r\nresponsibility to protect”. That report addresses some\r\nof the questions surrounding humanitarian intervention\r\nand sovereignty posed by the Secretary-General in his\r\nMillennium address. We encourage further debate and\r\ndialogue on the ideas expressed in the report.\r\nThe onus to rise to the challenges set forth by the\r\nSecretary-General and encapsulated in “The\r\nresponsibility to protect” rests also with the Security\r\nCouncil. It is unfortunate that the power of the veto\r\ncontinues to undermine the ability of this Organization\r\neffectively to respond to humanitarian situations and to\r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report provides a useful\r\naccount of the Organization’s activities during the past\r\nyear. It highlights the major challenges faced, of which\r\nthere were many. It was a year that — perhaps more\r\nthan ever before — demonstrated the unique value of\r\nmultilateral action through the United Nations.\r\nCollective action is needed, whether the challenge is to\r\nrespond to a major threat to global security and\r\nstability, or to combat poverty and promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The issues are complex and interrelated.\r\nWe fully endorse the Secretary-General’s view, as set\r\nout in paragraph 4 of his report, that “all nations stand\r\nto benefit from the constructive change that\r\nmultilateralism makes possible”.\r\nThe value of an annual report is in providing an\r\nanalytical account of recent developments that\r\nidentifies the major issues for an Organization in\r\nworking towards its key goals. As a stakeholder in this\r\nOrganization, we look for something more than a\r\nhistoric record — rather, a strategic overview that can\r\nhelp us provide direction and advice to the\r\nOrganization on the best way forward.\r\nThe benefits of such an approach are picked up\r\nby the Secretary-General in his latest initiative to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations. He sees the report on\r\nthe work of the Organization as the precursor to a more\r\nforward-looking report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Together these documents\r\nwould form the annual report of the United Nations —\r\nlearning from what has happened in the past year and\r\napplying those lessons to the challenges ahead. We\r\nsupport this proposal to rationalize reporting and\r\nindeed wonder whether it might not be possible to take\r\nthe further step and combine the two reports in a single\r\ndocument. This would also have the advantage of\r\nfocusing this debate on achieving the Millennium\r\nGoals as central to the business of the United Nations.\r\nIn this regard, the Secretary-General has just provided\r\nus with a frank and disturbing assessment of the lack of\r\nprogress towards these goals.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nWe are not seeking change for change’s sake. As\r\nthe Secretary-General has said, his goal is to enhance\r\nthe coherence of analysis by the Secretariat and to\r\nencourage Member States to address related issues in\r\nan integrated way. This will allow us to maximize the\r\npolicy relevance and impact of our deliberations. We\r\nfully endorse this approach.\r\nThe 2002 report is comprehensive, and we would\r\ncomment on a few aspects only.\r\nThe Secretary-General rightly highlights the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the transitional administration\r\nof East Timor. On 20 May this year we witnessed the\r\nbirth of a new nation. Recently, that nation took its\r\nrightful place in the membership of this Organization.\r\nWe have commented elsewhere on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the process. Let me just say here that\r\nwe have learned the importance of an international\r\nresponse that is timely and flexible. In a remarkably\r\nshort time frame, the United Nations has had to provide\r\na diverse range of assistance. We welcome the\r\ncontinued engagement of the United Nations through\r\nthe United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor\r\n(UNMISET) in the knowledge that there is still much\r\nwork to be done.\r\nThere is also progress in Bougainville, Papua\r\nNew Guinea. The United Nations Political Office\r\nusefully complemented the work of the regional\r\n“coalition of the willing” Peace Monitoring Group and\r\nhas played an important role in weapons disposal. As I\r\nspeak, the second, bulk containment phase of the\r\nweapons-disposal process is scheduled to be nearing\r\ncompletion. The commitment shown by the parties lays\r\na solid foundation for future peace in Bougainville. My\r\nGovernment is confident that the new Government of\r\nPapua New Guinea, led by Sir Michael Somare, will\r\ncontinue to support the peace process in Bougainville.\r\nWe call on Francis Ona, the leader of the Me’ekamui\r\nDefence Force, to seize the opportunity to play his part\r\nin the history of Bougainville, for the future of all its\r\npeople, and join the peace process as it moves to\r\ncompletion. If current progress is maintained, the\r\nelection of an autonomous Bougainville Government\r\nshould be possible within the next 12 months.\r\nThe international intervention in Afghanistan has\r\nbeen perhaps the most comprehensive of its kind. With\r\nsecurity provided by International Security Assistance\r\nForce (ISAF), the Security Council approved a\r\nmandate for the United Nations operation, United\r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)\r\nthat included humanitarian, recovery, political,\r\ngovernance and peace-building elements. This\r\nacknowledges the fact that complex situations require\r\ncomplex solutions.\r\nWe have been pleased with developments in the\r\npeacekeeping area, including improved consultation\r\nbetween the Security Council and troop-contributing\r\ncountries. It is encouraging to note that the Department\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has set itself a\r\nsmall number of strategic goals and that significant\r\nprogress has been made in enhancing rapid deployment\r\ncapability, especially with the United Nations Standby\r\nArrangements System (UNSAS) for personnel. New\r\nZealand was pleased to formalize its commitment to\r\nUNSAS this year with the Prime Minister signing a\r\nMemorandum of Understanding. We would encourage\r\nother States to support the United Nations in this\r\nregard. We also note that the strategic deployment\r\nstocks in the logistics base at Brindisi are being\r\nenhanced. New Zealand over the last few years has\r\nmade a substantial contribution to the peacekeeping\r\nmission in East Timor. We will continue to play our\r\npart in supporting United Nations peacekeeping efforts\r\nwithin our available resources and capabilities.\r\nThe past year has witnessed the rejuvenation of\r\nglobal commitment to sustainable development. The\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment brought about a remarkable consensus on\r\nthe need for global action to address development\r\nissues through adequate financing, people-centred\r\ndevelopment, policy reforms and the involvement of all\r\nrelevant stakeholders.\r\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\r\nreiterated the importance of sustainability in the\r\nholistic process of development and our shared\r\nresponsibilities in this regard. WSSD saw the\r\nestablishment of important objectives on water and\r\nsanitation, oceans, energy, natural resources,\r\nbiodiversity, health, and the addressing of regional\r\nconcerns, including those of the Pacific island States. It\r\nupheld universal social objectives and the\r\ndetermination to eradicate poverty. It offered fresh\r\nideas on the roles of the United Nations agencies,\r\nincluding the streamlining of the Commission on\r\nSustainable Development. Coupled with the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg have left the United Nations and its\r\nMember States with a clear road map for global\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nprogress. The challenge now, is to ensure effective\r\nimplementation of those undertakings. New Zealand\r\nlooks forward to working with the international\r\ncommunity to achieve that.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report notes that work\r\nhas begun on further reform of the Organization. We\r\nwelcome his initiative to further strengthen the United\r\nNations and believe that his proposals, if fully adopted\r\nand implemented, could substantially improve the\r\nOrganization. We will address his proposals in more\r\ndetail under the relevant item.\r\nMr. Wang Yingfan (China): The Chinese\r\ndelegation wishes to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nhis reports on the work of the Organization and on the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The two reports cover the progress made\r\nin all major areas of work and deserve serious\r\nconsideration by Member States. Here, I would like to\r\nmake the following comments in the light of these\r\nreports.\r\nFirst, even as mankind has entered into the\r\ntwenty-first century, we are still faced with severe\r\nchallenges in safeguarding world peace. In the Middle\r\nEast, the vicious cycle of violence between Israel and\r\nPalestine has not stopped. In Iraq, the danger of war\r\nbreaking out exists. If it should happen, the already\r\nturbulent situation in that region would become more\r\ncomplex. The situation in the South Asia subcontinent\r\nis also worrying. In spite of the fact that different\r\ndegrees of progress have been made in reaching\r\npolitical settlement in some regional conflicts in\r\nAfrica, peace and stability have not prevailed. While\r\nthe international struggle against terrorism has reaped\r\nfirst fruits, tasks to eliminate the root causes are\r\nonerous and the road is long.\r\nThe international community should have a sober\r\nunderstanding of the threats that face the current peace\r\nsituation. It must deal with all kinds of problems, new\r\nand old, with renewed thinking and methods in the\r\nlight of emerging novel situations and problems and\r\nprepare to face numerous complicated security\r\nchallenges with multiple means, such as political,\r\neconomic, scientific and technological and cultural\r\nmeans. It must also always attach importance to\r\nensuring that the United Nations plays a central role in\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nSecondly, the prevention of the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems\r\nand the eventual elimination of those weapons are\r\ncrucial for maintaining and enhancing international\r\npeace and security. The full participation of and close\r\ncooperation among all States is a prerequisite for the\r\nsuccess of international non-proliferation efforts. In\r\nthis regard, we should give full play to the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations.\r\nChina has always been firmly opposed to the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and has\r\ntaken concrete actions in this regard. Recently, the\r\nChinese Government promulgated regulations on\r\nexport control of missiles and missile-related items and\r\ntechnologies, and the missiles and missile-related items\r\nand technologies export control list. Moreover, the\r\nChinese Government will promulgate in the near future\r\nadministrative rules on export control of chemical\r\nitems and related equipment and technologies, and\r\nregulations on export control of biological dual-use\r\nitems and related equipment and technologies. With the\r\npromulgation of the above-mentioned regulations,\r\nChina will establish a comprehensive system of export\r\ncontrols over sensitive items covering the nuclear,\r\nbiological, and chemical and missile fields.\r\nChina supports the full implementation of the\r\nthirteen nuclear disarmament steps contained in the\r\nFinal Document of the 2000 Nuclear Non-Proliferation\r\nTreaty (NPT) Review Conference on the premise of\r\nmaintaining global strategic stability and undiminished\r\nsecurity for all countries. China welcomes the new\r\ntreaty between the United States and the Russian\r\nFederation on the reduction of strategic offensive\r\nforces, and hopes that the United States and Russia, as\r\nthe countries with the largest nuclear arsenals and\r\nbearing special and primary responsibilities for nuclear\r\ndisarmament, will continue to drastically reduce and\r\ndestroy their nuclear weapons in a verifiable and\r\nirreversible way.\r\nChina is of the view that the Conference on\r\nDisarmament should at an early date re-establish the\r\nAd Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race\r\nin Outer Space and start substantive work with a view\r\nto negotiating and concluding an international legal\r\ninstrument that would prevent the weaponization of\r\nand the creation of an arms race in outer space. The\r\ngoal is to prevent outer space from becoming a new\r\nbattlefield.\r\nThirdly, over the past year, the United Nations\r\nhas sponsored a series of important conferences,\r\nincluding the International Conference on Financing\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nfor Development and World Summit for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, during which the Monterrey Consensus\r\nwas forged and the Johannesburg Declaration and Plan\r\nof Implementation were adopted. These were of great\r\nsignificance for promoting the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. However, efforts in\r\nimplementing those goals are very unbalanced. Much\r\nof sub-Sahara Africa and large parts of Central Asia are\r\nhardly advancing, and some even falling back in\r\npoverty-reduction. Some parts of Latin America are\r\nalso slow in this area. Based on the current trend, it\r\nwill be very difficult for the developing countries to\r\nachieve the objective of halving the poverty rate by\r\n2015.\r\nIn order to meet the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity should take more active measures to\r\nincrease the investment of resources. At present, it is of\r\nutmost importance to do the following: first, developed\r\ncountries ought to open their markets to developing\r\ncountries, expedite their implementation of\r\ncommitments in debt-reduction and enable official\r\ndevelopment assistance to reach a percentage of 0.7 per\r\ncent of their gross national product, so as to enable\r\npractical solutions to issues of finance and technology\r\nthat are necessary for meeting the development goals.\r\nSecondly, we advocate promoting a balanced and\r\nsteady development of economic globalization,\r\nreforming the current rules in the world economy and\r\nstrengthening the guidance and management of the\r\nglobalization process.\r\nThirdly, there should be a strengthening of\r\ndeveloping countries’ capacity for self-development.\r\nThe international community should respect the right\r\nof the developing countries to choose a development\r\npath suited to their own national conditions and\r\nprovide them with assistance in areas such as\r\ninstitution-building, personnel training and\r\ncompetitiveness development.\r\nFourthly, the international community should\r\ncontinue to promote sustainable development and a\r\nbalanced development of the economy, population,\r\nresources and environment, with a view to achieving\r\nappropriate integration of economic return, social well-\r\nbeing and environmental benefits. The international\r\ncommunity should also endeavour to combine the\r\nefforts to address environmental problems of individual\r\ncountries with their efforts to tackle global concerns.\r\nMultilateralism has become the main theme of the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly. Most Member\r\nStates support the remarks made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, to the effect that multilateralism, with the\r\nUnited Nations as its centre, is needed by all nations in\r\norder to meet global challenges successfully.\r\nExperience has shown that, as the most universal\r\nand representative inter-governmental Organization,\r\nthe United Nations has an irreplaceable role to play in\r\nsafeguarding peace, promoting development,\r\nenhancing anti-terrorism cooperation and helping to\r\nsolve global problems, such as mass movements of\r\nrefugees, HIV/AIDS, overpopulation and\r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\nRecently, the Secretary-General submitted a\r\nreport entitled “Strengthening of the United Nations:\r\nan agenda for further change” (A/57/387). This report\r\ndeserves serious study by Member States. China will,\r\nas always, actively support and participate in the\r\nUnited Nations reform process.\r\nMr. De Alba (Mexico)(spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave received with interest the first annual report on\r\nthe progress made by the United Nations system and\r\nMember States in the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. There is no doubt that these\r\nreports and the five-year report are essential in order to\r\nprovide concise monitoring of the fulfilment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nHowever, I must note our concern that, in the first\r\ntwo years since the adoption of the Declaration,\r\nprogress in the fulfilment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and the broader and cross-cutting\r\ngoals, such as the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, disarmament, human rights, democracy,\r\ngood governance and attention to the specific needs of\r\nAfrica, have been very uneven.\r\nThe results of this report should be taken as an\r\nearly warning sign regarding the need to pool our\r\nefforts and resources at the national, regional and\r\ninternational levels, in order to remedy these\r\ndisparities, if we wish to reach the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals by the year 2015, as we committed\r\nourselves to doing.\r\nIt should be recalled that these goals are not new.\r\nRather, they sum up the commitments undertaken in\r\nseveral world conferences held during the 1990s.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nFailure to meet them would render the United Nations\r\nOrganization irrelevant.\r\nThe development goals range from the\r\neradication of poverty and hunger to the fight against\r\ninfectious disease and the reduction of infant and\r\nmaternal mortality. The report makes it clear that\r\nadvances made in recent years in the developing\r\ncountries conceal, in general, a much more fragmented\r\nreality. The figures as a whole do not reflect the\r\nenormous disparities that exist between the regions that\r\nmake up the developing world and between the\r\ncountries within a single region, with East Asia and the\r\nPacific at one extreme, and a large part of sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica and Central Asia at the other.\r\nThe present slowdown of the world economy is a\r\nfactor that certainly was not foreseen when the\r\nMillennium Declaration was adopted and thus renders\r\nthe pursuit of its Goals more difficult. This slowdown\r\nis affecting all countries in the world inasmuch as\r\nglobalization links all economies, directly or indirectly;\r\nbut, above all, it makes more remote the possibility that\r\nthe poorest countries and developing countries, which,\r\ndue to their geographical situation, may be at an\r\nadditional disadvantage — as is the case of small\r\nisland States and landlocked States — would be able to\r\nreach the Millennium Goals.\r\nThe Monterrey consensus recognized the primary\r\nresponsibility of each country for its own economic\r\nand social development. At the same time, it\r\nrecognized the link of national economies to the global\r\neconomic system and the fact that the success of\r\nnational development efforts depends not only on\r\nGovernments’ adopting appropriate policies, but also to\r\na great extent on their having a favourable international\r\nenvironment.\r\nDirect foreign investment, international trade,\r\nsustainable financing of external debt, official\r\ndevelopment assistance and greater coherence and\r\ncoordination of the monetary, financial and\r\ninternational trade systems are basic instruments to\r\nensure that the efforts of developing countries can bear\r\nfruit.\r\nThis linkage between national economies and the\r\nworld economic system means that the only way to\r\napproach the problems of development is through\r\nbroad strategic alliances, conceived between\r\nGovernments, international institutions and civil\r\nsociety, including, especially, the private sector. This\r\nwas clearly embodied in the Millennium Declaration\r\nand in the summits that have been held since that time,\r\nsuch as the Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nconferences.\r\nA sustainable environment is another of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, in which, although\r\nthere has been some progress, there have also been\r\nsignificant setbacks. We are moving away from this\r\ngoal when we allow, among other things, continued\r\ndeforestation and dependency on fossil fuels. The\r\nconsequences of global warming could more seriously\r\naffect the poorer regions, which are those least to\r\nblame for the problem. Therefore, the report makes an\r\nappeal, endorsed by Mexico, that developed countries\r\nshould lend assistance to those developing countries\r\nmost vulnerable to climate change, so that they can\r\nadapt in the best possible way to its effects on their\r\neconomies. It is clear that what is required is greater\r\ncooperation between the industrialized and the\r\ndeveloping countries, since we are dealing with shared\r\nresponsibility. But, above all, we are dealing with a\r\nparticular responsibility — that of the developed\r\ncountries — inasmuch as they have contributed to the\r\ngreater extent to the deterioration of the environment.\r\nAmong threats to international peace and security,\r\ncertainly terrorism is in the foreground. This subject\r\nhas received special attention over the past year,\r\nstemming from the tragic events in the United States on\r\n11 September 2001. We, United Nations Member\r\nStates, have shown solidarity and collective\r\nresponsibility in our response to these attacks.\r\nHowever, we must not lose sight of the fact that\r\nterrorism is not the only threat to international peace\r\nand security and that in order to confront it more\r\neffectively it is necessary to attack its causes.\r\nSimilarly, it is essential to bear in mind that we\r\nmust take special care to fully respect human rights in\r\nthe fight against terrorism.\r\nWe are also concerned about the fact that the\r\ninconclusive results in promoting democratic systems,\r\ngood governance and respect for human rights in\r\ngeneral show insignificant progress. The most recent\r\nHuman Development Report confirms the fact that the\r\nlink between democracy, the rule of law and human\r\ndevelopment constitutes an essential principle for\r\npolitical stability. It is also therefore essential for\r\npeace, transparency in public administration, the\r\npolitical participation of our populations and the\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\noverall well-being of our peoples. Democracy could be\r\nimperiled if the principles and policies that national\r\nGovernments committed themselves to implement\r\nwhen they adopted democratic systems were to be\r\nignored in the management of the international\r\neconomic system. The same will be true if measures\r\nare not adopted to counteract the negative impact of the\r\nglobal economic downturn and that of globalization in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMs. Tan (Singapore): We congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General for his thoughtful and balanced\r\nreports on the work of the Organization and the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. They\r\nare concise and analytical accounts of the work of the\r\nUnited Nations over the past year. It is particularly\r\ncommendable that the Secretary-General not only\r\nfocused on the successes, but also highlighted the\r\nproblems that need to be addressed.\r\nWhen this agenda item was debated last year, we\r\nobserved with regret that the Secretary-General could\r\nnot report on the performance of the board of directors\r\nof the United Nations, that is, the Member States of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We also suggested that it was\r\npossible that some of the legislative processes within\r\nthe United Nations might have become dysfunctional.\r\nIn his seminal work, Swords Into Ploughshares,\r\nInis Claud, Jr., observed the following about the\r\nGeneral Assembly:\r\n“The Assembly’s central position in the\r\nadministrative system of the Organization,\r\ntypified by its electoral, budgetary and\r\nsupervisory powers, makes it the institutional hub\r\nof the United Nations. Thus the evolution of\r\nconstitutional relationships within the United\r\nNations system has tended to make the General\r\nAssembly the unrivalled principal organ of the\r\nentire system.”\r\nIn fact, Mr. Claud expressed concern about the\r\nincreasing role of the General Assembly at the expense\r\nof the Security Council. That was in 1956, when the\r\nbook was first published. How does that compare with\r\nthe situation today? The Secretary-General noted in his\r\nreport entitled “Strengthening of the United Nations:\r\nan agenda for further change” that\r\n“The General Assembly is the only\r\nuniversal forum in which all States have an equal\r\nvoice. Through its power to consider and approve\r\nthe budget, the Assembly has a great deal of\r\nauthority for the effective functioning of the\r\nUnited Nations. Yet, many Member States\r\nconsider that the Assembly’s contribution to the\r\nOrganization’s work is diminishing, and I share\r\ntheir concern.” (A/57/387, para. 15)\r\nThe prestige of the United Nations balances on a\r\ntripod made of three equally important legs: the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\r\nSecretariat. The award of the centennial Nobel Peace\r\nPrize to the United Nations and the Secretary-General\r\nlast year is a clear recognition that the United Nations\r\nhas done some things right. The Secretariat has\r\nundergone a period of significant reforms through the\r\ninstitutional process and programme improvements\r\nimplemented by the Secretary-General since 1997. It\r\nhas now emerged leaner and fitter, even though it is\r\nbeing asked to do more within unchanging budgets.\r\nA lot more could be done to improve the Security\r\nCouncil’s accountability, transparency and willingness\r\nand ability to act in a timely manner in situations\r\naffecting international peace and security. But some\r\nnoteworthy and substantive progress has been made to\r\nits working methods. Many of those developments are\r\noutlined in the report prepared by the Secretariat and\r\ncirculated as document S/2002/603, dated 6 June 2002.\r\nThose improvements are also noted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations.\r\n(Mr. Bouallay (Bahrain), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.)\r\nIn comparison, the General Assembly is\r\nincreasingly seen as the weakest link of that tripod. The\r\nmedia have little or no interest in the statements\r\ndelivered. There is a perception that the General\r\nAssembly is saddled with an ever-expanding laundry\r\nlist of issues, many of which are repetitive and have\r\nbeen on the agenda for years. In fact, issues that are\r\nclearly within the prerogative of the General Assembly\r\nare increasingly being raised in the Security Council,\r\nwhere the chances of catching media and public\r\nattention are greatly enhanced. Examples include\r\nHIV/AIDS and the protection and promotion of the\r\nrights of women and children.\r\nIncidentally, it is interesting to note that although\r\nthe General Assembly comes before the Security\r\nCouncil in the ordering of the Chapters in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, in the United Nations daily\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nJournal Security Council meetings are always\r\npresented before General Assembly meetings.\r\nWe are in a paradoxical situation. We are all\r\nagreed on the importance of revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly. During the general debate, three weeks ago,\r\nnearly all delegations cited revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly as an important priority. However, despite\r\nseveral successive rounds of reform, the pervasive\r\nassessment is that we have not done enough. Many\r\nresolutions have been passed on revitalization since the\r\nforty-sixth session. Many of the ideas put forward have\r\nbeen on the table for quite a long time. What we really\r\nneed is the will to implement them and to change the\r\nstatus quo.\r\nAll that is not to say that there have not been\r\nrecent improvements to the General Assembly. The\r\nSecretary-General said in his report on the Millennium\r\nDeclaration that the innovations endorsed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in response to his 97 reports on\r\nrenewing the United Nations and on the Brahimi report\r\nhad enabled the Organization to act with greater unity\r\nof purpose, coherence of efforts and agility. But those\r\nare not sufficient. Several permanent representatives\r\nand other representatives observed that the General\r\nAssembly that they knew from, say, 20 years ago, was\r\nthe hub of United Nations activities. The debates in the\r\nplenary Hall were lively and interesting. Lively and\r\ninteresting debates are not ends in themselves. But the\r\ndeep somnolence that characterizes our debates now\r\ncannot be desirable.\r\nThe General Assembly is clearly overburdened\r\nwith an ever-expanding agenda. Worse still, we have\r\ncontinued with our old working methods, rituals and\r\nhabits — resulting in repetitious statements and\r\nexhausting negotiations. The truly worrisome aspect of\r\nit all is that the energies expanded are often not\r\ncommensurate with the outcomes achieved. The result\r\nis exhausted representatives, dissipated energies,\r\ndissatisfactory implementation of agreed goals and a\r\ndisinterested public, with consequent impacts on\r\nfollow-up. The Secretary-General made similar\r\nobservations in his reports on the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nUnder the leadership of the President’s\r\npredecessors we have made some progress towards\r\nmanaging agenda items more efficiently through\r\nclustering and spacing out of the frequency at which\r\nissues appear on the agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are already benefiting from this, and the work\r\nprogramme for this year’s plenary meetings is much\r\nimproved. We are particularly pleased that in his\r\nstatement at the opening of the fifty-seventh session,\r\nthe President announced his intention to hold panel\r\ndiscussions and informal consultations on issues of\r\ncommon interest, as well as to streamline the General\r\nAssembly agenda.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, agreed to by our\r\nleaders, clearly sets out priorities including precise and\r\ntime-bound goals. The Secretary-General’s proposed\r\nroad map to implement the Millennium Declaration\r\nprovides a good basis for the work of the General\r\nAssembly. During his press conference on the fifth\r\nprogress report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Secretary-General\r\nreported that the world was falling short in meeting the\r\nMillennium Goals. The achievement of many of those\r\ngoals depends on actions taken at the national level.\r\nIt is also very important that the General\r\nAssembly align its activities with the Goals.\r\nIt is also very important that the General\r\nAssembly align its activities with the Goals. The many\r\ndraft resolutions we deliberate on and adopt in the\r\nGeneral Assembly must be streamlined with a view to\r\nachieving those Goals in the most expeditious way.\r\nThere have been good examples of proactive action\r\ntaken by some committees. Last year, for example, the\r\nSecond Committee agreed to defer discussions on\r\nseveral key issues since they were already being\r\nnegotiated in the context of the preparations for the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment. We understand that the Second\r\nCommittee is currently in the midst of examining its\r\nworking methods in order to implement effectively the\r\noutcomes of recent high-level summits and meetings\r\nsuch as the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Social\r\nDevelopment. All such practices are highly\r\ncommendable and should be actively considered.\r\nWe fully support the views expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General in the concluding paragraphs of the\r\nreport on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration that efforts to revitalize the General\r\nAssembly must continue if the Organization is to\r\nassume in full the responsibilities entrusted to it by the\r\nCharter. We are all aware of the problems facing the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We need to intensify our efforts to\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nrationalize its agenda, working methods and\r\nprocedures. The General Assembly is an\r\nintergovernmental body, and only Governments can\r\nensure that it is able to effectively play its role as the\r\nchief deliberative, policy-making and representative\r\norgan of the United Nations. A tripod is a simple yet\r\nremarkably stable and ingenious piece of engineering\r\nequipment. A tripod needs all of its three legs to be\r\nequally strong. We have a critical need to fortify the\r\nthird leg — the General Assembly — in order to ensure\r\nfor the United Nations a position of strength and\r\nstability.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Let me begin by\r\ncomplimenting the Secretary-General on his\r\nintroduction to the report before us on implementation\r\nof the United Nations Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration has given new\r\npriorities and a new direction to the Organization and\r\nits Member States. Each country must choose a\r\nstrategy to achieve the goals that we have set\r\ncollectively. The important issue is, however, that the\r\nMillennium Development Goals be reached within the\r\nagreed time limits. The international community and\r\nmultilateral and bilateral donors must ensure that their\r\nefforts to assist in this endeavour are based on national\r\npoverty-reduction strategies. This will ensure both\r\nnational ownership and a coordinated approach.\r\nThe prospects for achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, based on current trends, are\r\ndecidedly mixed, with marked differences between and\r\nwithin regions. This can to some extent be explained\r\nby the different approaches chosen by countries to meet\r\nspecific goals.\r\nThe Secretary-General has made it clear in his\r\nreport, that the world is falling short in meeting the\r\nobjectives that world leaders agreed on two years ago\r\nin the Millennium Declaration. Let this be a timely\r\nwarning to us all. Those in need and “We the\r\npeople” — our constituencies — will not understand\r\nwhy we have made so little progress on the road to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe Secretary-General is also cautioning that\r\ninsufficient progress is being made in meeting the\r\nbroader objectives in the Declaration on issues such as\r\nhuman rights, democracy and good governance,\r\nconflict resolution, and the special needs of Africa.\r\nMy Government is firmly convinced that there\r\nare clear links between peace and security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the broader sense and good governance\r\nand respect for human rights. Every country is\r\nresponsible for its own development, and this includes\r\nthe responsibility for creating national mechanisms for\r\nsharing political, social and economic goods and\r\nensuring the protection of civil liberties and human\r\nrights — in other words, the responsibility to help\r\nbuild democracy. This is a crucial and universal\r\nresponsibility that no Government can ignore, whether\r\nor not it is measured against the attainment of the\r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nThere is another, equally important, responsibility\r\nthat also needs to be clearly highlighted. The same kind\r\nof solidarity and sharing that we are asking for at the\r\nnational level from all of our partners has a universal\r\nand global parallel: it is called official development\r\nassistance, and it is a development tool of the first\r\norder. Official development assistance should, by any\r\nreasonable standard of solidarity, have reached at least\r\n0.7 per cent of donors’ gross national product a long\r\ntime ago.\r\nPreliminary estimates show that the funds needed\r\nto fulfil the Millennium Development Goals are at least\r\nequal to a doubling of the present level of official\r\ndevelopment assistance. It could well be much higher.\r\nSince we as donor countries now have specific\r\ncommitments to meet and a better understanding of\r\nwhat it takes to fulfil the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, it is more than reasonable to expect renewed\r\nefforts to meet official development assistance\r\ncommitments. It is also reasonable to expect improved\r\nmarket access for developing countries, reduced debt\r\nburden and other initiatives of equal importance to our\r\npartners in the developing countries.\r\nThis is also a question of meeting the scale of the\r\nchallenges. It is no use emptying a few buckets of\r\nwater onto a raging wildfire. Our most important fire-\r\nfighting equipment for achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals is hard cash. This is particularly\r\ntrue when its comes to reaching targets such as halving\r\npoverty, achieving universal primary education and\r\nreversing the spread of killer diseases.\r\nMeeting the special needs of Africa is a challenge\r\nthat in one way or another involves practically all the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. This is another\r\nchallenge whose real magnitude must be viewed in the\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\ncontext of the scale of the problems and met\r\naccordingly, by both the international community and\r\nthe African countries themselves. My Government\r\ncommends the African leaders on the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) initiative and on\r\ntheir willingness to tackle their continent’s diverse and\r\ndifficult problems. It is our belief that this new policy\r\nwill contribute to peace and security and the prevention\r\nof armed conflict, which is a prerequisite for\r\nsustainable development. The NEPAD initiative is a\r\ntruly valuable one and is worthy of international\r\nsupport.\r\nBetter ways must be found to support and finance\r\nthis and other national and regional initiatives,\r\nhowever. Since the Millennium Summit, we have taken\r\non new commitments at Doha, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg on trade, financing for development and\r\nsustainable development. We have also succeeded in\r\ncreating new partnerships in those areas. These\r\npartnerships should be developed and better tailored to\r\nsupport initiatives like NEPAD. This is one way of\r\nadvancing towards the universal attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Given the sheer\r\nnumbers and stark statistics of Africa, we have no\r\noption but to tackle Africa’s urgent problems if we are\r\nto be anywhere near achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThis is particularly true when we consider the two\r\nissues highlighted in this year’s report — the\r\nprevention of armed conflict and the treatment and\r\nprevention of major diseases, including the devastating\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. These are, of course, not\r\nspecifically African issues, but their impact is felt more\r\nstrongly on that continent than anywhere else.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration also has a bearing on\r\nthe strengthening of the United Nations. My\r\nGovernment is a strong believer in multilateralism and\r\ninternational solidarity. We believe firmly that United\r\nNations Member States have a responsibility to meet\r\ncommon challenges and to solve common problems.\r\nWe therefore welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport “Strengthening the United Nations: an agenda\r\nfor further change”. It is necessary to focus the\r\nOrganization’s attention on achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and on following up on the recent\r\nworld conferences. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the new priorities outlined in the report. All\r\nactivities should be scrutinized for policy coherence to\r\nensure that the Millennium Development Goals are\r\ncomprehensively addressed in the revised programme\r\nbudget for the biennium 2004-2005.\r\nLet me in conclusion also say that we welcome\r\nthe start of a millennium campaign to make the\r\nmillennium commitments better known throughout the\r\nworld and to ensure that they are the focus of global\r\naction. We think that the emphasis on national reports,\r\nwhere all stakeholders can participate, is a brilliant\r\nidea. We highly appreciate the appointment of Ms.\r\nEveline Herfkens, former Minister for Development\r\nCooperation of the Netherlands, to advise and assist the\r\nSecretary-General in this regard.\r\nMr. Manalo (Philippines): I wish to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive and\r\nsubstantive reports on the work of the Organization and\r\nthe follow-up to the Millennium Declaration. In view\r\nof our limited time, however, I shall focus only on\r\nsome issues raised in the report on the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation shares the Secretary-General’s\r\nviews on the continuing political, economic,\r\nenvironmental and technological challenges facing our\r\nworld. Issues such as terrorism, mass refugee\r\nmovements, HIV/AIDS, weapons of mass destruction,\r\nenvironmental degradation and pollution remain high\r\non our agenda.\r\nOn conflict prevention, the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to move the United Nations from a\r\nculture of reaction to one of prevention should be\r\nsupported. We continue to believe that conflict\r\nprevention remains the most efficient approach to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nHowever, it is important to note that conflict\r\nprevention should ultimately aim at addressing the root\r\ncauses of potential conflicts and that conflict\r\nprevention measures of the United Nations should be\r\nundertaken in accordance with the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, taking into account the\r\nhistorical background and political milieu of each\r\nsituation being addressed. We shall be guided by these\r\nprinciples when we return to the pending draft\r\nresolution on this item later in this session.\r\nPeacekeeping remains a major task of this\r\nOrganization. This past year proved to be one marked\r\nby relative success. In this regard, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the conclusion of the Transitional\r\nAdministration of East Timor. As a neighbour from the\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nSouth-East Asian region and having been an active\r\nparticipant in United Nations initiatives and\r\npeacekeeping operations in that country, the\r\nPhilippines is pleased that the Democratic Republic of\r\nTimor-Leste has emerged from adversity to become the\r\nnewest Member of the United Nations.\r\nAfter the horrors of 11 September, the issue of\r\nfighting terrorism has become a priority issue on our\r\nagenda. My Government has fully supported and\r\ncontinues to fully support the efforts of the United\r\nNations to fight terrorism and we encourage the\r\nSecretary-General to assist Member States in\r\ncomplying effectively with Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001). While the year under review witnessed an\r\naccelerated pace in the ratification of legal instruments\r\non terrorism, manifesting vigilant global support for\r\ncombating terrorism, much remains to be done.\r\nWe must also continue to work for the full\r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. The Philippines is a party to these\r\nTreaties and ratified the Treaty on South-East Asia\r\nNuclear Weapon Free Zone, thus fulfilling our\r\nconstitutional requirement of keeping the Philippines\r\nfree from nuclear weapons. We also continue to support\r\nthe convening of an international conference devoted to\r\ndisarmament.\r\nIn the area of small arms, which is also cited in\r\nthe report, the Philippines hosted a regional seminar on\r\nimplementing the United Nations Programme of Action\r\nto Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, with\r\nthe co-sponsorship of Canada last July, as a follow-up\r\nto the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects. The\r\nseminar, in which member countries of the Association\r\nof South-East Asian Nations, as well as China, Japan\r\nand the Republic of Korea participated, focused on the\r\nproblems associated with the proliferation of small\r\narms.\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-General’s views on\r\nthe alarming number of civilians who continue to be\r\ndisplaced either by natural disasters, armed conflict or\r\ncases of potential conflict. The deepening humanitarian\r\ncrises in many parts of the world that have caused new\r\nwaves of displacement are of great concern to many,\r\nincluding my Government. At the same time, as\r\nglobalization progresses, more opportunities and\r\ngreater choices for people to travel the world in search\r\nof and finding a livelihood are being created. Their\r\nsafety and welfare thus become of paramount\r\nimportance. We therefore encourage Member States to\r\nbecome State parties to the International Convention on\r\nthe Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers\r\nand Members of Their Families, and to support the\r\nimportant work of humanitarian assistance agencies,\r\nsuch as the International Organization for Migration.\r\nPropelled by economic differentials, internal\r\npolitical disorder, global networks of communication\r\nand transportation, and the political and economic\r\nconstraints on the admission of migrants and refugees,\r\nthe global nature of migration involving hundreds of\r\nmillions of people requires that much higher priority be\r\ngiven to this issue in the United Nations system. As\r\nstated by the Secretary-General in his report on an\r\nagenda for further change, it is time we took a more\r\ncomprehensive look at the various dimensions of the\r\nmigration issue.\r\nWe are also pleased to note the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reference in his report to the link between the\r\nMonterrey Consensus on financing for development\r\nand a number of the core Millennium Development\r\nGoals. The most immediate and urgent task before us is\r\nto ensure that the Monterrey process enters its\r\nimplementation stage by translating the Monterrey\r\nConsensus into concrete action measures. The follow-\r\nup to Monterrey is a priority issue on the agendas of\r\nboth the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nOn the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, we share the Secretary-General’s view\r\nthat the Summit has put us on a path that reduces\r\npoverty while protecting the environment. It is also\r\nimportant that the follow-up processes on financing for\r\ndevelopment and sustainable development complement\r\neach other.\r\nThe Philippine Government supports the United\r\nNations commitment to African development priorities\r\nwithin the framework of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development and through the African Union.\r\nThe Philippines has had a strong bond of friendship\r\nand solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Africa,\r\nwith whom we share common concerns, values and\r\naspirations. In terms of technical assistance, as stated\r\nby my Secretary of Foreign Affairs during the most\r\nrecent general debate, the Philippines has held\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\npreliminary discussions with donor countries for\r\nproviding technical assistance to Africa, especially in\r\ncapacity-building. He expressed confidence that these\r\ntalks would bear fruit.\r\nWe are further pleased to note the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s inclusion of the problem of HIV/AIDS as\r\none of his priority areas. The Philippines continues to\r\nsupport the goals of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, especially on the need to involve civil\r\nsociety, individuals and organizations in combating the\r\npandemic. We also join other Governments in\r\ncontinuing to lobby for the affordable and easily\r\naccessible treatment of HIV/AIDS.\r\nMy delegation also recognizes the need to\r\npromote equal opportunities for the elderly and for\r\npeople with disabilities in order to develop their\r\nabilities and to integrate them into the mainstream of\r\nour societies. We urge the Secretary-General and\r\nMember States to give high priority to this issue.\r\nThe continuing efforts of the Secretary-General to\r\nstrengthen the Organization are, indeed, welcome. In\r\nthis regard, we find a number of the recommendations\r\nin his report entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change” (A/57/387) to\r\nbe both necessary and timely. We will comment on\r\nthem in more detail at the appropriate time during this\r\nsession.\r\nOn the overall issue of United Nations reform,\r\nour priority continues to be the revitalization of our\r\nmost universal forum, the General Assembly, both\r\nstructurally and in terms of more meaningful and\r\nsubstantive interaction with the other principal United\r\nNations organs. The Philippines therefore urges that we\r\nbuild upon last year’s exercise, while, at the same time,\r\nbegin to implement agreed measures aimed at\r\nstrengthening the General Assembly. In this regard, the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and Presidents of\r\nfuture sessions of the Assembly might wish to consider\r\neffective ways to implement those existing mandates,\r\nsuch as convening more informal and interactive\r\ndebates on certain plenary items such as the present\r\none on the report of the Secretary-General on the work\r\nof the Organization (A/57/1) and the report on the\r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Declaration (A/57/270) or\r\non the report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAs suggested in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “Strengthening of the United Nations:\r\nan agenda for further change”, we need a more\r\ncoherent approach towards issues and our work in\r\ngeneral. Perhaps that could be achieved by aligning the\r\nGeneral Assembly agenda with the priorities of the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the decisions of recent\r\nglobal conferences, and by maintaining the flexibility\r\nto incorporate issues of immediate or urgent concern to\r\nthe international community. This may not be as easy\r\nto accomplish as it sounds, but it is certainly worth a\r\nserious attempt on our part.\r\nMr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\npresentation that the Secretary-General made on\r\n12 September, on his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/57/1) and his report on implementing\r\nthe Millennium Declaration (A/57/270) shared the\r\ncommon denominator of reaffirming multilateralism as\r\na fundamental diplomatic tool for ensuring peace.\r\nThe lessons learned from the tragic events of the\r\nlast century and the beginnings of the current century\r\nindicate that the grave problems we must face\r\ntranscend national borders and that, as a consequence,\r\nthey require coordinated solutions at the global level.\r\nThe United Nations, because of its global mandate and\r\nuniversal representation, is the institution within which\r\nwe must forge the agreements enabling humanity to\r\nadvance together in overcoming the current challenges.\r\nThe two documents that we are examining on this\r\noccasion devote a substantial section to the question of\r\npeace and security. The Secretary-General notes that\r\nthe grave events we are witnessing in various regions\r\nof the world are more akin to the state of anarchy\r\ndepicted by Hobbes than to the noble aspirations\r\nembodied in the Millennium Declaration. We should\r\nstudy his words with the same seriousness which they\r\nembody and acknowledge that the construction of an\r\norder ensuring peace will always depend on the\r\npolitical will of States and on their readiness to abide\r\nby rules that have been agreed on collectively. All are\r\nbound by that requirement, but only the unwavering\r\ncommitment of the most powerful can ensure that such\r\nan order works effectively.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s call that we not wait for\r\nthe outbreak of conflicts but, rather, that we work\r\npatiently for their prevention captures an essential\r\naspect of the problem. A common will to direct human\r\nand material resources to that objective must be shown.\r\nThat was possible in the recent past, when two\r\nsuccessful preventive peacekeeping operations were\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\ncreated, the United Nations Preventive Deployment\r\nForce in Macedonia and the United Nations Mission in\r\nthe Central African Republic. We agree that the\r\nregional and subregional context is also decisive in\r\nadequately managing a conflict, and we encourage\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations in discussing and exchanging experience\r\non conflict prevention and the coordination of joint\r\nendeavours.\r\nWe have examined the work carried out by the\r\nvarious peacekeeping operations. We agree that,\r\ndespite the persistence of other grave situations, there\r\nis cause for satisfaction. Timor-Leste’s admission to\r\nthe Organization is the result of its people’s determined\r\nstruggle for the recognition of their right to self-\r\ndetermination. It has also been seen that when there is\r\nthe political will, a clear mandate, sufficient financial,\r\nlogistic and human resources and an exit strategy, the\r\nUnited Nations can play a very constructive role that\r\nhelps to lay the foundation for the political, social and\r\neconomic development of a country. Another\r\nremarkable case is that of Sierra Leone, where the\r\nwork of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone\r\nand the disarming of the combatants led to elections\r\nand the formation of a Government that must now lead\r\nthe way to a lasting national recovery.\r\nThe grave situation of civilian populations in\r\ncomplex emergencies, who become the direct target of\r\nattacks and abuses of all types, is cause for concern.\r\nAlmost two years ago, the Secretary-General called for\r\nfinding ways to respond to those attacks while\r\nrespecting the sovereignty of States.\r\nAt the invitation of the Canadian Government,\r\nArgentina has contributed to the preparation of a\r\ncollective process of reflection, as described in the\r\nreport presented by the International Commission on\r\nIntervention and State Sovereignty, entitled “The\r\nResponsibility to Protect”. The report invites us to\r\nconsider sovereignty — rather than as a right — as a\r\nresponsibility to ensure the well-being of the\r\npopulation. My Government wishes to thank Canada\r\nfor that initiative, which provided the basis for a\r\nprocess of reflection that cannot be postponed.\r\nThere is no doubt that, as is amply expressed in\r\nboth reports, the brutal terrorist attack against the\r\nUnited States on 11 September of last year, in addition\r\nto being a criminal attack on its immediate victims,\r\nwas an extraordinary challenge to everything that the\r\nUnited Nations represents in terms of defending peace\r\nand human rights. We believe that since those tragic\r\ndays, the international community has reacted in a\r\nconcerted manner to suppress the financing, planning\r\nand execution of terrorist acts, as well as to make\r\nprogress in the creation of binding legal instruments.\r\nThe categorical condemnation of terrorism cannot\r\nbe qualified for any reason without risking a descent\r\nalong a slippery slope of highly dubious ethics.\r\nHowever, it is true that behind the evil actions of\r\nterrorist groups often lies a profound malaise of the\r\nsocieties in which this phenomenon arises. That is why\r\nit is necessary to analyse the context in which terrorism\r\nemerges in order to attack its causes and to prevent its\r\nproliferation.\r\nStates that are weak or that have fallen into\r\nanarchy and disintegration are a source of international\r\nthreats from which come global ills such as terrorism\r\nand trafficking in arms and drugs. The international\r\ncommunity must not forget or underestimate the\r\nimportance of the so-called forgotten conflicts, since\r\nwe still have before us the example of what happened\r\nin Afghanistan under the Taliban.\r\nWe believe that poverty eradication and the need\r\nto achieve development for all, the key objectives of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, are priorities whose\r\nrelationship to violence cannot be underestimated. We\r\nmust focus great efforts to achieve development, given\r\nthe bleak picture described by the documents, which\r\nindicate that the world is divided as never before\r\nbetween rich and poor.\r\nThe Monterrey Conference produced a broad\r\nConsensus on means for mobilizing resources to that\r\nend. We fervently hope that the commitments made\r\nwill become a reality. Important pledges were made for\r\ndevelopment assistance that lead us towards the goal of\r\ncontributing O.7 per cent of the gross national product\r\nof developed countries, which only some have\r\nachieved.\r\nThere were also agreements reached there\r\nregarding free trade and access to markets. However,\r\nsome events this year indicate that the principles of the\r\nfree market, so strongly advocated by the developed\r\ncountries, actually continue unapplied. Protectionism\r\ncontinues, and $1 billion continue to be spent daily on\r\nagricultural subsidies, excluding the exports of\r\ndeveloping countries from the market. It is essential\r\nthat the Monterrey Consensus be implemented, that the\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nwill for trade liberalization expressed at Doha not be\r\nthwarted and that negotiation within the context of the\r\nWorld Trade Organization be intensified. The price of\r\nfailure would be very high, as the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals would not be achieved and\r\nconfidence in multilateral action would weaken,\r\nresulting in more conflicts and tension.\r\nIt has been rightly said that lack of respect for\r\nhuman rights and the absence of democracy are factors\r\nthat intensify political and social tension. The United\r\nNations has already achieved important work in\r\npromoting and protecting human rights at all levels. We\r\nbelieve that in that area the lack of confidence of those\r\nwho see political motives behind every reference to\r\nhuman rights must be overcome. Bloc voting in\r\nmultilateral forums, referred to by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report, serves no purpose in opposing\r\nhow human rights violations are addressed, because it\r\nonly evades a problem that will soon erupt resulting in\r\nserious repercussions. We must work together to ensure\r\nthe full operability of the special procedures of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights, its system of\r\ncommunications and the committees established\r\nthrough international instruments in that domain.\r\nThe entry into force of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is an institutional advance\r\nthat Argentina supports because it is aimed at putting\r\nan end to impunity and preventing genocide, war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. The Criminal\r\nCourt will play an outstanding deterrent role in the\r\nprevention of future human rights abuses. It must also\r\nbe strengthened and its substance must be supported.\r\nAnother important factor in the outbreak of\r\nconflicts can be found in the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. In that context, the Argentine Republic\r\nwelcomes the work done by the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies in the process that led to the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, recently\r\nheld in Johannesburg, which identifies concrete actions\r\nfor implementing the commitments made in Agenda 21\r\nin the economic, social and environmental fields.\r\nArgentina notes with satisfaction the contents of\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General regarding the\r\nadministration and management of the Organization. In\r\nthat respect, my country firmly supports the\r\ndevelopment in the area of information technology,\r\nparticularly the integrated management information\r\nsystem. That is undoubtedly an element that provides\r\ngreat added value to the work of United Nations\r\npersonnel. We also look forward to the reports\r\nconcerning the capital master plan, particularly the\r\nproposals for agreements on financing it, which should\r\nbe the subject of detailed discussion by the Fifth\r\nCommittee.\r\nThe initiatives presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will strengthen the Organization in the area of\r\nadministration and management, with a view to\r\nadvancing the implementation of the objectives of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Argentina pledges its\r\nparticipation in the consideration of that item by the\r\nFifth Committee. We support the process of\r\nstrengthening and reform of the United Nations now\r\nunder way, and we shall speak in due course on that\r\nitem when it comes before the Assembly. We agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General that any reform of the\r\nUnited Nations will be incomplete without reform of\r\nthe Security Council. We want and need a Council that\r\nis more transparent in its procedures, more democratic\r\nin its decision-making, more representative in its\r\nmembership and more responsible.\r\nAmid present difficulties, we do not want the\r\nwords of the Millennium Declaration to serve in the\r\nfuture “as grim reminders of human needs neglected\r\nand promises unmet”, as stated in the report on the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration. Every State knows\r\nwhere its responsibilities lie, but only by through\r\ncoordination will we be able to respond within a\r\nmultilateral framework to the expectations in our\r\ncountries that Members of the United Nations will be\r\nable to guarantee a future of peace, stability and\r\nprogress.\r\nMr. Akinsanya (Nigeria): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing appreciation to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his report on the work of the\r\nOrganization. The report, contained in document\r\nA/57/1, discussed some of the most pressing issues\r\nconfronting humanity today, such as terrorism,\r\nconflicts, natural disasters, human rights questions, the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, poverty and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The report is, therefore, not only a\r\nreview of the relentless efforts of the Secretary-General\r\nto seek constructive solutions to those fundamental\r\nproblems; it is also recognition of the complexities of\r\nthe tasks confronting our Organization.\r\nWhile some success has, obviously, been\r\nachieved in resolving some conflicts across the globe, a\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nlot still needs to be done to usher in durable peace and\r\nstability to conflict-ravaged States. In that regard,\r\nNigeria commends the continued efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General on his use of the tools of quiet\r\ndiplomacy, fact-finding and confidence building\r\nmissions, informal networks of eminent persons,\r\nmediation, conciliation and arbitration in the search for\r\npeace. To some extent, modest successes have been\r\nrecorded in the area of conflict prevention, mediation\r\nand resolution. For example, the total number of armed\r\nconflicts is on the decline, and there has been a\r\nsignificant increase in the number of peace agreements,\r\nespecially in Africa. The adoption of a comprehensive\r\nand multidisciplinary approach to conflict prevention\r\nis, to our satisfaction, yielding good results.\r\nIn complying with the Millennium Declaration,\r\nregional organizations are strengthening their capacity\r\nin the area of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, through the establishment, with the assistance\r\nof the United Nations, of institutional arrangements for\r\nconflict prevention, management and resolution. In\r\nWest Africa, for example, the establishment by the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) of the Conflict Prevention, Resolution and\r\nManagement mechanism, as well as complementary\r\ninstitutions, such as the Council of Elders and the\r\nMano River Women’s Peace Network, are efforts\r\naimed at institutionalizing conflict prevention strategy\r\nin the sub-region. In this respect, the United Nations, in\r\nactive collaboration with ECOWAS and Mano River\r\nUnion countries, participated in addressing complex\r\nhumanitarian, political and security situations affecting\r\nGuinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\r\nWe commend United Nations continued support\r\nof ECOWAS initiatives in the promotion of dialogue\r\namong these countries, in the belief that, without such\r\ndialogue, efforts to address the root causes of the sub-\r\nregions problems may not yield desired results. Nigeria\r\ntherefore commends the establishment of the office of\r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary General for\r\nWest Africa as a demonstration of the United Nations\r\ncommitment to work closely with regional\r\norganizations and member States in finding solutions to\r\nthe problems within the region. In this regard, we urge\r\nfinancial and logistical support to regional and sub-\r\nregional organizations in order to enhance their\r\neffectiveness.\r\nAs the world marks the anniversary of the\r\nunfortunate events of 11 September 2001, Nigeria\r\nreaffirms its unequivocal condemnation of all acts of\r\nterrorism, and its firm commitment to join all efforts\r\nwithin the United Nations and outside to combat this\r\nmenace. We also pledge our cooperation with other\r\nmembers of the international community, through\r\nbilateral and multilateral efforts, to combat terrorism in\r\nall its manifestations. Nigeria condemns, in the\r\nstrongest terms, all acts of terrorism and urge firm\r\naction by all Member States of the international\r\ncommunity to fight this global phenomenon and to\r\ndeny any support to terrorists and their cohorts.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, our leaders resolved\r\nto eliminate weapons of mass destruction, especially\r\nnuclear weapons, and to reduce the global risk posed\r\nby small arms, light weapons and landmines. The\r\nexcessive accumulation, easy accessibility to, and\r\navailability of small and light weapons, hinder peace-\r\nbuilding and development efforts and threaten human\r\nsecurity. In this regard, Nigeria reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the Programme of Action adopted by\r\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, held\r\nin July 2001. We urge the international community to\r\ncontrol the movement of these weapons, especially to\r\nnon-State actors. We also call for the early elaboration\r\nof a legally binding international instrument to combat\r\nillegal trafficking in these arms.\r\nWith respect to landmines, Nigeria notes with\r\nsatisfaction the success in the implementation of the\r\n1999 Ottawa Convention. We observe that partnerships\r\nbetween the United Nations, Governments, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and international\r\norganizations have resulted in progress on mine action,\r\nwith a consequent decrease in the production and\r\ntransfer of anti-personnel landmines. Nevertheless,\r\nlandmines continue to impede the development and\r\nsecurity of populations, especially in some African\r\nStates emerging from conflicts. We should therefore\r\nstrengthen our support for the United Nations mine\r\naction, as it is the only source of curbing the menace of\r\nlandmines.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to pose a\r\ngrave challenge to our developmental efforts. We\r\nappreciate the efforts of the United Nations and the\r\ncontribution of the international community in\r\ncombating the HIV/AIDS scourge, particularly in\r\nAfrica. Nigeria endorses the call by the Secretary\r\nGeneral for a major new global campaign in the fight\r\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We also endorse the\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nPlan of Action adopted at the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) Special Summit on AIDS, which\r\nunderscored the commitment of African leaders to\r\nintensify their efforts and mobilize resources for\r\nprevention, care and treatment of people infected by\r\nthe disease.\r\nNigeria commends the Secretary-General for the\r\nestablishment of a Global Aids and Health Fund in\r\norder to mobilize sufficient funds necessary to address\r\nthe AIDS pandemic. In spite of its own commitments,\r\nNigeria has redeemed its pledge of contributing $10\r\nmillion to the Global Aids Fund.\r\nWe also recall that at the Millennium Declaration,\r\nour leaders resolved to eliminate poverty by launching\r\na sustained campaign to make the right to development\r\na reality for all. In order to reduce poverty and promote\r\ndevelopment, it is essential to achieve sustained and\r\nbroad-based economic growth. The Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals highlighted priority areas that must\r\nbe addressed, including commitments made by\r\ndeveloped nations, such as increased official\r\ndevelopment assistance and improved market access\r\nfor exports from developing countries. It is regrettable,\r\nhowever, that our development partners have yet to\r\nmatch their words with action on this matter of crucial\r\nimportance for the achievement of the Millennium\r\nGoals.\r\nThe increasing level of poverty in developing\r\ncountries, particularly in Africa, suggests that not much\r\nhas been achieved with respect to increasing ODA and\r\nforeign direct investment flows to them, thereby\r\nconstraining their ability to meet the targets of the\r\nMillennium Declaration on poverty eradication. If the\r\ninternational community must meet its goals of\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, conscious efforts\r\nmust be made to accelerate economic growth in\r\ndeveloping countries. Nigeria therefore urges Member\r\nStates to ensure that Millennium Development Goals\r\nare incorporated into their national development plans,\r\nas they would help to increase the coherence of\r\nnational policies and programmes.\r\nWith the establishment of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), African countries\r\nhave accepted responsibility for their own social and\r\neconomic development. We acknowledge the\r\nimportance of sound national policies and good\r\ngovernance, as prerequisites for poverty reduction and\r\nsustained national growth. We therefore welcome the\r\nfulsome recognition of the special needs of Africa, as\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration, and the\r\noverwhelming support for NEPAD at the recent high-\r\nlevel debate of the General Assembly. Africa is poised\r\nto free itself from the throes of poverty, disease and\r\nunder-development. We count on the support of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community in the\r\naccomplishment of this goal.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations and other\r\nsources of international law have established\r\nconditions under which justice and respect for the\r\nobligations arising from treaties can be maintained. We\r\nobserve that the rule of law at the international level is\r\nbecoming more widely accepted and States are\r\nincreasingly employing treaties to regulate their\r\nrelations. In this regard, we commend the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court,\r\nestablished by the Rome Statute. We believe that its\r\ncreation will contribute significantly to compliance\r\nwith international humanitarian law and respect of\r\nfundamental freedom.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria is pleased to note that the\r\nSecretary-General has made commendable efforts\r\ntowards strengthening the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations. We also note that the Secretary-General has\r\ntaken various initiatives, and hope that this would help\r\nus achieve the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nreach the targets we have set for ourselves.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): The Secretary-General,\r\nin his address to the General Assembly, stressed the\r\never-increasing importance of multilateralism and the\r\nresponsibility of Member States of the United Nations\r\nto uphold the principles embodied in the Charter of our\r\nOrganization. For that, and for his reports on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration and on\r\nthe Work of the Organization, respectively, my\r\ndelegation expresses its appreciation.\r\nWe live in a world where so many of its citizens\r\nare troubled. So many people have lost hope for the\r\nfuture. How much effort we put into realizing a more\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world, in which all\r\nhuman beings can live better and safer lives, is the\r\nchallenge we all face.\r\nThe Secretary-General tells us that the events of\r\n11 September last year brought us closer to the\r\nsituation of millions of people around the world for\r\nwhom the world had long been dangerous. What we do,\r\ntherefore, to avoid a reoccurrence should make\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\neverywhere in the world a safe place for human beings.\r\nTerrorism thrives on fear and division; only through\r\ncollective action can we combat that menace. The\r\nSecretary-General said it all when he pointed out that\r\nthe causes and motivation of terrorism need to be\r\nanalyzed in each specific context. Only then can our\r\naction be purpose- and goal-oriented. The\r\noverwhelming response to Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) demonstrates the resolve of Member\r\nStates to address this worldwide challenge. However,\r\nthe considerable strain that it is putting on the limited\r\ncapacities of developing countries to implement\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) need to be seriously addressed.\r\nHIV/AIDS is spreading fast, and improving their\r\naccess to drugs is slow and very painstaking for those\r\nin developing countries. It is estimated that, of the 28\r\nmillion people infected with HIV/AIDS, 26 million are\r\nin sub-Saharan Africa. In the light of that grave\r\nsituation, it is estimated that $10 billion a year is\r\nneeded to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries,\r\nyet only a fraction of that has been secured.\r\nMeanwhile, global military spending stands at $800\r\nbillion a year. That is not morally right, and something\r\ndifferent must be done. What is needed is access to\r\naffordable drugs and to a preventive vaccine. The\r\nmajor criterion in resource distribution should be the\r\nimpact of the disease.\r\nChildren orphaned by HIV/AIDS need immediate\r\nattention, because they are at high risk. Malaria and\r\ntuberculosis are also spreading. Therefore, any efforts\r\nto combat the spread of HIV/AIDS must focus on\r\nwomen and girls if we are to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Nowhere else is the problem of\r\norphans and vulnerable children more rife than in rural\r\nareas in sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, the harmonization\r\nof policies among the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations, the World Food\r\nProgramme and the International Fund for Agricultural\r\nDevelopment with regard to the impact of HIV/AIDS,\r\nfood security and rural poverty is a welcome\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhile progress is being made in some regions in\r\nthe area of poverty eradication, on the whole, Africa\r\ncontinues to lag behind. The simple fact of life is that\r\ndeveloping countries cannot escape the web of poverty\r\nthrough their own efforts alone. The feminization of\r\npoverty is on the increase and needs to be addressed.\r\nThe efforts of the United Nations Development Fund\r\nfor Women and of other United Nations agencies aimed\r\nat helping women to improve their control over their\r\neconomic assets need to be supported. If only the\r\nprogrammes of action agreed to at all major United\r\nNations conferences could be implemented, then true\r\npartnership in eradicating poverty could be realized\r\nand progress could be made in halving poverty by\r\n2015.\r\nAt this juncture, let me reiterate that there are\r\nacute food shortages in Southern Africa as a result of\r\ndrought. We welcome the positive response to the\r\nUnited Nations appeal for Southern Africa. Natural\r\ndisasters are recurrent, and the best way to address\r\nthem is through an early-warning system. Food security\r\nin Africa needs to be addressed in the context of efforts\r\nto combat drought and desertification and acute water\r\nshortages.\r\nThe causes of conflict are multidimensional. We\r\nmust do more in that area, and indeed we can prevent\r\nconflict from breaking out. We must invest more in\r\nconflict prevention. We concur with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the capacity of States and of the United\r\nNations needs to be bolstered. Regional organizations\r\nhave a crucial role to play in that regard, and they need\r\nto be supported.\r\nJust as the causes of conflict have many\r\ndimensions, so do its effects. As a country that\r\nemerged from a war of national liberation, we know\r\ntoo well the challenges posed by the reintegration of\r\nex-combatants into society. That is a long-term\r\nprogramme dictated by specific conditions in each\r\ncountry. All parties to a conflict, the United Nations\r\nsystem and the international community as a whole\r\nhave responsibility towards such people.\r\nIf we can strengthen the capacities of the United\r\nNations funds and programmes in the vital area of\r\nnation-building, then we can accelerate the processes\r\nof peacemaking and peace-building. The long-standing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union should be strengthened to complement\r\nmutual efforts towards conflict prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding. In that context, efforts should be made to\r\naddress the problems of the spread of small arms and\r\nlight weapons in Africa. In situations of conflict, the\r\nmajor problem has often been lack of access to\r\nhumanitarian assistance. It is estimated that in Angola,\r\napproximately 800,000 people have gained access to\r\nsuch assistance for the first time in many years.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nAfter favourable conditions have been created,\r\nthe problem then becomes one of low response to\r\navailable humanitarian assistance. That needs to be\r\naddressed, because, besides their nutritional needs, the\r\nhealth of women and girls — especially their\r\nreproductive health — warrants assistance. The\r\nsituation of children is particularly important. We\r\nwelcome the National Immunization Days of UNICEF,\r\nand we call on the parties to any conflict to honour\r\nthose humanitarian efforts. The delivery of\r\nhumanitarian assistance comes at a high price for\r\nUnited Nations staff and for other humanitarian\r\nworkers. The Inter-Agency Security Management\r\nNetwork should, therefore, be supported earnestly.\r\nNever before in recent times had multilateralism\r\nbeen emphasized as it was during the general debate of\r\nthe fifty-seventh session. The growing political, social\r\nand economic problems that we face in this\r\ninterconnected world require such an emphasis. The\r\nUnited Nations is an imperfect institution, but there is\r\nno alternative to it. What we must do is to enable the\r\nOrganization to meet effectively the demands that we\r\ncontinue to place upon it, so as to make this world a\r\nbetter place for all, as our leaders committed\r\nthemselves to do in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, I should like to extend my thanks to the\r\nSecretary-General for the two very useful reports that\r\nwe are considering today. We have studied them with\r\ninterest, given the fact that they contain a clear\r\npresentation of the work of the Organization and of the\r\nprogress made towards the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nLast year a new challenge to humankind emerged:\r\nthe threat posed by international terrorism. As a\r\nconsequence of the regrettable events of 11 September\r\n2001, international recognition of the new gravity of\r\nthis new challenge led to efforts on the part of the\r\norgans of the United Nations to confront this dangerous\r\nphenomenon. This has proved once again the pivotal\r\nrole of the United Nations in addressing international\r\nproblems and phenomena, particularly with respect to\r\ninternational terrorism, which does not recognize any\r\nborder or belong to any religion or culture.\r\nWe reiterate once again our support for the efforts\r\nof the United Nations in combating international\r\nterrorism. We believe it must play a practical and\r\npivotal role in this regard as an effective tool that\r\nrepresents international will and legitimacy. Indeed, it\r\nhas been successful in coordinating international\r\nefforts to suppress international terrorism.\r\nEgypt believes that joint international efforts to\r\nachieve development should be based on the fact that\r\nthis is a joint ethical, humanitarian and political\r\nresponsibility on the part of the North and of the South.\r\nIt is the best way to achieve prosperity for all and to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. Egypt\r\ntherefore calls for the strict implementation, in letter\r\nand spirit, of the decisions of the Millennium Summit\r\nand of other international conferences and summits.\r\nHistory’s final judgement will not be based on the\r\ngood intentions and recommendations contained in\r\npolitical declarations, but on our success in\r\nimplementing them. We noted with concern, in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, the statistics on the\r\nimplementation of international development goals and\r\non the major disparities among different geographical\r\nregions, as well as the difficulties facing the African\r\ncontinent in achieving these goals.\r\nIn this connection, Egypt would like to emphasize\r\nthat, in order to implement international development\r\ngoals, the international community should have the\r\npolitical will to make resolute efforts to find a solution\r\nto the external debt problems of the developing\r\ncountries; increase official development assistance to\r\ninternationally agreed levels; liberalize the trade\r\npolicies of industrialized countries, particularly in\r\nfields of interest to the States of the South, such as\r\nagriculture, textiles and clothing; address the issues of\r\nprice instability of primary commodities and transfer of\r\ntechnology to developing countries and provide the\r\nnecessary technical assistance to them.\r\nHence we call on the international community to\r\nfollow up on the implementation of the commitments it\r\nhas undertaken vis-à-vis the developing countries to\r\ncomplement their own efforts in that regard.\r\nThe commitments undertaken in the context of\r\nthe Declaration’s Development Goals are not only the\r\nresponsibility of the developing countries, with their\r\nlimited national resources; they are a joint\r\nresponsibility that requires the efforts of developed and\r\ndeveloping countries alike. It not enough, therefore, to\r\nrefer only to the importance of various international\r\ndevelopment goals and international documents.\r\nRather, these goals and the availability of funds to\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.22\r\nimplement them should be linked in keeping with the\r\nlimited time frames.\r\nInternational studies have indicated that\r\nachieving the goal set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration of halving the number of people living in\r\nabject poverty in Africa by 2015 will require that the\r\neconomy of that continent increase by at least 7 per\r\ncent annually. This will require closing a financing gap\r\nof $64 billion a year. But how can the continent come\r\nup with this enormous amount of money in the context\r\nof its current financial and trade system? What is\r\nrequired at this stage is not simply to diagnose and\r\ndescribe poverty academically at round tables, but\r\nmultilateral consideration. We are of the view,\r\ntherefore, that the continuing unfavourable\r\ninternational economic conditions and the large\r\ndecrease in United Nations resources earmarked for\r\nachieving its development goals and operational\r\nactivities are issues that must be addressed.\r\nThis is the starting point for the channeling of the\r\nresources promised by the countries of the North at\r\nMonterrey and for achieving the goals and\r\nimplementing the programmes of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the commitments undertaken at\r\nJohannesburg. The United Nations should continue to\r\nplay its pivotal role in elaborating the political\r\nframework for international development and should\r\nendeavour to harmonize and integrate international\r\ndevelopment policies.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General makes clear\r\nthe fact that the attempt to control the spread of\r\ninfectious disease is absorbing most of the funds\r\nallocated to international development. The impact of\r\nthose diseases is not confined to the enormous losses in\r\nterms of human life; it is also limiting the production\r\ncapabilities and consequently the income of those\r\nStates.\r\nDevelopment losses have a double impact in\r\nterms of their dimensions and their effects. It is\r\ndifficult to speak of the economic consequences of\r\ninfectious diseases, particularly AIDS, which affects\r\nmore than 60 million people. A third as many have\r\ndied, and treatment is still difficult. All we can do is try\r\nour hardest to provide drugs for them that will curb the\r\nspread of the disease and enhance their immunity.\r\nIn this regard, the report states that the\r\noverwhelming majority of AIDS patients cannot afford\r\nthese drugs. An incurable disease is a very sad thing.\r\nHowever, the fact that the drugs exist but cannot be\r\nacquired is psychologically destructive and ethically\r\nwrong.\r\nWe agree, therefore, with the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendation that there is a need for additional\r\nresources that exceed the current flows. We agree also\r\nwith the call in the report to enhance the capacities of\r\nhealth-care institutions in the developing countries to\r\nhelp them deal with this disease.\r\nThe Organization’s humanitarian efforts are of\r\nparticular importance and should be supported at this\r\ndifficult stage of humanity’s history. There has been an\r\nincrease in natural disasters and armed conflicts, which\r\nhas led to the loss of many lives and the destruction of\r\ninfrastructure. It has adversely affected development\r\nefforts in many countries, and has given rise to an\r\nunprecedented number of refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons.\r\nWe strongly condemn any violations perpetrated\r\nagainst civilians in time of war. We call on the\r\ninternational community to urge all States and parties\r\nto a conflict to respect the rights of civilians and not to\r\nsacrifice them to political or military ends. We\r\nemphasize the need for humanitarian assistance to\r\nreach these civilians. My country calls for applying the\r\nsame standards in all cases, particularly since all the\r\nrules of international humanitarian law are binding on\r\nall States, whether big or small. In this connection,\r\nEgypt calls upon the international community to face\r\nup to the humanitarian emergency situation being\r\nexperienced by the Palestinian people. This matter\r\nappeals to the international conscience, and will serve\r\nto provide this defenseless people with protection, as\r\nwell as save the peace process in the Middle East.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.35 a.m.\r\n"
