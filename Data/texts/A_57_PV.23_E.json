(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Hidayat\r\n(Indonesia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 44 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/270 and\r\nA/57/270/Corr.1)\r\nAgenda item 10 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/57/1)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nthe representative of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The tragic events of 11 September 2001 gave\r\na powerful impetus to our collective efforts to combat\r\ninternational terrorism and, as rightly underlined by the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General in his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nhighlighted once again the vital importance of\r\nmultilateral efforts in preserving international peace\r\nand stability. The Russian Federation has always\r\nbelieved that a strong and efficient United Nations is\r\nthe key tool to collectively manage international affairs\r\nand to build a stable multi-polar world order based on\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the rules of\r\ninternational law. In this regard, it is necessary to\r\ncontinue improving and strengthening the\r\nOrganization, and this is one of the most important\r\ntasks to bear in mind when implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s appeal to\r\nformalize in the United Nations agenda the\r\nOrganization’s reform priorities as set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. In his reports, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, with good reason, emphasizes the unique role\r\nplayed by the United Nations and the Security Council\r\nin international efforts to combat terrorism. The strong\r\ndetermination to unite efforts to oppose terrorism is\r\nseen in the activities carried out by the international\r\nanti-terrorist coalition. Russia is one of the responsible\r\nparticipants in this coalition. It is vitally important that\r\nthe coalition follow the consolidating and coordinating\r\nlead role of the United Nations and the Security\r\nCouncil, according to the rules of international law,\r\nparticularly Council resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1377\r\n(2001).\r\nWe note with satisfaction that, over the past year,\r\nthe Organization has made great progress in regional\r\nconflict settlement issues, such as the assistance\r\nrendered to East Timor in its acquiring independence,\r\nthe provisional self-governance authorities in Kosovo,\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the\r\nTransitional Administration in Afghanistan. We share\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General’s view of the\r\nimportance of the progress made during the past year,\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nimproving peacekeeping operations and increasing the\r\nUnited Nations’ rapid deployment capability.\r\nThe Security Council’s key role at each phase of\r\na peacekeeping operation — from the time of\r\nauthorizing such operation, to adopting its mandate,\r\nand until its completion — is clearly defined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. In this context, it is of crucial\r\nimportance to prevent any attempt to overlook the\r\nSecurity Council’s authority, particularly when it\r\ncomes to deciding on the use of force on behalf of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe welcome the positive developments seen in\r\nenhancing the capabilities of Member States, the\r\nSecretariat and the United Nations system at large to\r\nplan and conduct peace-making operations. However,\r\ncontemporary large-scale problems in the world’s\r\nhotspots require further intensification of joint efforts\r\nat all levels — national, regional and international —\r\nto improve and provide States’ assistance in\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building to the Organization.\r\nIn this context, we are deeply concerned about the\r\npersistent problem of shortage in troops and logistics to\r\nconduct peacekeeping/peacemaking operations,\r\nespecially on the African continent.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s assessment of\r\nthe growing role of preventive diplomacy as a reliable\r\nmeans of safeguarding stability in the world. The\r\nunique set of political and diplomatic tools to resolve\r\nalmost every acute international problem now available\r\nto the international community should be used\r\neffectively. We support the Organization’s development\r\nstrategy, reaffirmed in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\naimed at the eradication of poverty, the promotion of\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nParticular importance is attached to United\r\nNations activity guaranteeing a more equitable\r\ndistribution of globalization benefits among all\r\ncountries, including through their efficient\r\nparticipation in the international trade system, through\r\nstrengthened international financial structures and\r\nimproved access to the international resources for\r\ndevelopment purposes. The Conferences in Doha,\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg have become significant\r\nmilestones along the way to attaining such objectives.\r\nWe also note the new quality of interaction of the\r\nUnited Nations with the World Bank, the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF), the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) and other partners in achieving goals set up in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration and decisions of global\r\nforums.\r\nOn the whole, we share the Secretary-General’s\r\nopinion that, despite the complexity of the outcome of\r\nthe first stage of implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the success achieved shows, nonetheless,\r\nthat the given tasks are within the international\r\ncommunity’s power.\r\nThe Russian Federation will continue to work\r\nactively to implement the Millennium Summit\r\ndecisions in the future on the basis of the widest\r\npossible cooperation with the United Nations. The\r\nobjectives set out in the Millennium Declaration cover\r\nall of today’s pressing problems and lay the basis for\r\nshaping an effective global system to meet new threats\r\nand challenges, as proposed by Mr. Igor S. Ivanov,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation,\r\nin his address to the General Assembly.\r\nToday the entire world realizes the need for\r\nmaking cooperative efforts to overcome common\r\nthreats. We have already got political experience and\r\nlegal instruments for interaction, but the most\r\nimportant thing is that the international community\r\nhave a reliable mechanism — a United Nations — that\r\nis capable of acting as a global coordinating centre\r\nwith unique legitimacy, universality and potential.\r\nWe propose to adopt a resolution at this General\r\nAssembly session to encourage efficient and\r\ncoordinated action aimed at responding to the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. The Russian\r\ndelegation is putting forward a corresponding draft\r\nresolution, the essence of which is to facilitate further\r\ncollective efforts to implement the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, in such as way that all the objectives\r\nstipulated in it are attained on the basis of their organic\r\ninterrelation and interdependence in the globalization\r\nage.\r\nTo do so, all States, the United Nations, the\r\nspecialized agencies, regional organizations and the\r\nprivate sector, as well as civil society, should unite\r\ntheir efforts. We highly appreciate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s endeavour to promote interaction and\r\npartnership in all these areas, and we deem it important\r\nto encourage such interaction. We hope that our draft\r\nresolution will win support of the participants in this\r\nsession.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nthe representative of Cuba.\r\nMr. Requeijo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwant to express our thanks for the convening of this\r\nmeeting and for the opportunity given to us by the\r\nSecretary-General to discuss his report on the work of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nOn this occasion, we are trying a new way of\r\nconsidering this item by combining a debate with\r\nanother substantive item on the agenda, the follow-up\r\nto the outcome of the Millennium Summit. This is a\r\ncomplex task, because a number of reports have been\r\npublished by the Secretariat on these topics, and they\r\nrequire profound analysis by Member States. We have\r\nvery little time for this purpose.\r\nWe are now at a crucial point in the consideration\r\nof the United Nations system and how to adjust all of\r\nits institutions to enable them to deal with the realities\r\nof today’s world.\r\nThe follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nSummit provides us with a unique opportunity to begin\r\nthe process of creating a just and sustainable world\r\norder. It can serve as a turning point, making it possible\r\nto stem the new, elitist order of domination that has\r\nbeen taking shape before our very eyes, but without our\r\nparticipation.\r\nIn this regard, we thank the Secretary-General for\r\nintroducing his first annual report on the follow-up to\r\nthe outcome of the Millennium Summit, as contained\r\nin document A/57/270, which invites us to reflect on\r\nthe future of our Organization.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba considers the follow-up\r\nto the outcome of the Millennium Summit to provide a\r\nway of mobilizing the political will necessary to fulfil\r\nthe commitments contained in the Declaration, without\r\nany need to reassert or restate those commitments.\r\nWe believe that the Millennium Declaration is\r\nbasically well-balanced. Despite the various views and\r\npriorities of Member States, the Declaration has been\r\nable to provoke a largely positive response from the\r\nmajority with regard to the need for its implementation.\r\nMy country would like first of all to welcome the fact\r\nthat the Millennium Declaration reaffirms our support\r\nfor the purposes and principles of the Charter and that\r\neconomic and social development objectives constitute\r\nthe fundamental core of the international community’s\r\npriority goals.\r\nThe prevention of armed conflict is, without\r\ndoubt, a challenge that is confronting our Organization\r\nto a greater degree than ever before. Cuba believes that\r\nthe strengthening of the principles and objectives of the\r\nCharter and of international law remain the basic\r\npillars of international security: full respect for the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the non-\r\nuse of force in international relations and non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States.\r\nThe current unjust and profoundly inequitable\r\ninternational order must not be superseded by one that\r\nis yet more primitive and based on a unilateral\r\nreinterpretation of the Charter and of international law.\r\nWe should not, for example, seek a United Nations that\r\ncontributes to the achievement of a safer world by\r\nlegitimizing neo-interventionism on the pretext of\r\nhumanitarian action. The security problems that we are\r\nconfronting today will never be resolved through so-\r\ncalled preventive wars or “humanitarian” intervention,\r\nwhich, in addition to constituting a grave risk to the\r\nsecurity and stability of the developing countries, place\r\nthe United Nations in a position subordinate to\r\nhegemonic interests.\r\nIntervention is a gross violation not only of\r\nsovereignty but also of international law as it relates to\r\nthe use of armed force, which the Charter specifically\r\nallows as an exception only. So-called humanitarian\r\nintervention as an exception to Article 2 of the\r\nCharter — intervention that attempts to justify itself\r\nwith claims of protecting and defending human\r\nrights — is unacceptable.\r\nThe political manipulation of human rights,\r\nselectivity, partiality and double standards in the\r\nimposition of narrow-minded approaches must come to\r\nan end. Absolute and one-sided concepts of democracy\r\nbased on models that have nothing at all to do with the\r\nspecific characteristics of the society in question\r\ncannot continue to be imposed. If we allow the\r\nadvancement of ideas that would tend to give yet more\r\npower to the powerful, making it easier for them to\r\nexercise their policy of domination using our\r\nOrganization for that purpose, we would be\r\ncontributing directly to legitimizing the law of the\r\njungle in the system of international relations.\r\nAnother challenge presented by the Millennium\r\nDeclaration is the emphasis that the United Nations\r\nshould place on resolving the true causes of conflict\r\nand the problems of poverty and underdevelopment\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nthat today affect over four fifths of humankind. The\r\nUnited Nations has a fundamental role to play in\r\nmobilizing financial resources and promoting\r\ninternational cooperation — elements that are essential\r\nif we are to fulfil the commitments and goals of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Without greater political will\r\non the part of the developed countries and the reforms\r\nnecessary for the participation, on an equal footing, of\r\nthe developing countries in the monetary, trade and\r\nfinancial systems, the aspiration to achieve a better\r\nworld will amount only to good intentions and will not\r\nenable the eradication of poverty and the attainment of\r\nsustainable development in the era of globalization.\r\nNeo-liberal globalization has created a world with\r\nclear imbalances. Political, economic and technological\r\npower is concentrated in the rich countries, which\r\naccount for 20 per cent of the world’s population, while\r\nmillions in the developing world are marginalized and\r\ncontinue to live in extreme poverty and to suffer from\r\npoor health. For the developing countries, the right to\r\ndevelopment is an age-old aspiration. Despite the fact\r\nthat the Millennium Declaration includes the right to\r\ndevelopment among its commitments, it has been\r\nforgotten. Worse yet, some developed countries are\r\neven questioning their own commitment to bringing it\r\nabout. These countries — the same ones that preach\r\ngood governance and respect for human rights as a way\r\nof development — might well be asked whether the\r\nright to development is not a human right.\r\nMy delegation does not share the views expressed\r\nin the chapter of the report on the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration on human rights,\r\ndemocracy and good governance in public affairs,\r\nwhich imply that only civil and political rights are\r\nrelevant to the exercise of democracy. Such a claim is\r\ntantamount to disregarding the importance of social,\r\neconomic and cultural rights, and thus undermines the\r\nvalidity of the arguments contained in that chapter.\r\nA change is needed in the international economic\r\nand political order, and the United Nations must play\r\nan essential role in bringing it about. The international\r\nmonetary, economic and financial system must be\r\nreformed. There is a need for international\r\ngovernability to make current international economic\r\nrelations transparent and allow the developing\r\ncountries to be integrated into the world economy in a\r\nsustainable way, so that such countries can cease to be\r\npassive participants in the global decision-making\r\nprocesses. The developing countries cannot remain on\r\nthe sidelines as far as the benefits of the information\r\nand communication technologies revolution are\r\nconcerned.\r\nJust two years ago, the international community\r\ncommitted itself in the Millennium Declaration to\r\nhalting and beginning to reverse the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases by 2015. Rather\r\nthan improving, however, the global situation is\r\nworsening. Today, millions are dying of AIDS and\r\nmillions more are continuing to be infected by the\r\nvirus. More than 80 per cent of such deaths occur in\r\nAfrica, where the majority of the more than 28 million\r\npeople affected by the epidemic do not have proper\r\naccess either to the medication or treatment that they\r\nneed in order to fight the disease, avoid other\r\nopportunistic infections and alleviate their suffering.\r\nThe developing countries, particularly those in\r\nAfrica, require immediate support from the\r\ninternational community, since the resources available\r\nto them are insufficient. They have to allocate such\r\nresources to paying off their foreign debt instead of\r\nusing them for development. Today, Africa spends four\r\ntimes more on debt servicing than it does on education\r\nand health combined.\r\nTherefore, without the allocation of the needed\r\nresources and the contribution of the rich countries, it\r\nwill be impossible to reverse the trend, thus\r\naggravating these and other problems in the developing\r\ncountries.\r\nOnly if the developing countries receive special\r\nand differentiated treatment; if they are guaranteed full\r\naccess to markets; if the deterioration in commodity\r\nprices is halted; if their foreign debt is cancelled; if\r\nthey obtain access to modern technology; if official\r\ndevelopment assistance is increased; and if they are\r\ngiven the necessary financial resources without\r\ninterference or precondition will they be able to\r\nachieve sustainable development.\r\nThe commitment to multilateralism should lead to\r\nthe exercise of shared responsibility on the part of all\r\nStates in the attainment of those commitments and\r\ngoals. We also firmly believe, however, nonetheless\r\nthat such responsibility must be differentiated between\r\nthe rich and the poor countries so that special measures\r\nmay be applied that favour the developing countries.\r\nNot to do so would be to perpetuate inequality and\r\nmake us unable to fulfil the desired development\r\nobjectives established in the Millennium Declaration.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran): I wish to\r\nbegin by expressing my gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for producing a comprehensive and thoughtful\r\nreport on the work of the Organization. This report\r\nbears witness to the extensive and unrelenting efforts\r\nmade by the Secretary-General and his colleagues in\r\nthe Secretariat to advance the goals of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation applauds the Secretary-General for\r\nhis significant focus, both in his report and in his\r\ninsightful address to this Assembly, on the constructive\r\nchange that multilateralism makes possible, as well as\r\nthe opportunities and solutions that it provides. We\r\nbelieve that such a focus is of especially great\r\nimportance at this stage of international relations. We\r\nare pleased that the leadership of the United Nations\r\nhas taken the lead in developing the principles and\r\npractice of multilateralism and, in so doing,\r\nproficiently lived up to the expectations of the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nUndoubtedly, a growing tendency towards\r\nunilateral action that has intensified in the past year or\r\ntwo lies at the origin of the ongoing uncertainty and\r\ninsecurity and, if unchecked, may cause a dangerous\r\nand widening rift between those who tend to act\r\nunilaterally and the wider international community.\r\nAnd as such, it poses fundamental risks to the\r\ninternational system, in the sense that it has already\r\ngiven rise to conflicting conceptions of how the great\r\npublic goods — security, peace, environment, health,\r\ntrade, aid and so many other things — can be achieved.\r\nUnilateral policy and behaviour are not\r\ncompatible with the globalized and interconnected\r\nnature of the current international system and are thus\r\nnot sustainable in the medium and long terms. A glance\r\nat the actual world reveals that, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral correctly states in his report,\r\n“no single country has the capacity to cope with\r\nthe political, economic, environmental and\r\ntechnological challenges of an interconnected\r\nworld”. (A/57/1, para. 4)\r\nIt is obvious that the current international structure is\r\nnot unipolar in the sense that one super-Power, no\r\nmatter how powerful it may be, can effectively resolve\r\nimportant international issues alone.\r\nIt is against this background that the vision\r\nprovided by the Secretary-General on the need to\r\nenhance multilateralism takes on more importance.\r\nInasmuch as the United Nations is a universal\r\nOrganization and the unilateral approach runs counter\r\nto its very existence, it is appropriate and\r\ncommendable that the leadership of this Organization\r\nplay a leading role in preserving and promoting\r\ncooperation and coordination at the international level.\r\nDriven by this vision, clearly, the leadership of\r\nthe Secretary-General has made a significant difference\r\non the issues of peace and security. To the extent\r\npossible, the United Nations has done its best to live up\r\nto the expectations of the world community with regard\r\nto the challenge of terrorism in the wake of the terrorist\r\nattacks on 11 September. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport refers to multi-pronged efforts undertaken by the\r\nUnited Nations with a view to mobilizing and\r\nharmonizing the global struggle against terrorism. In\r\nour view, the United Nations is playing its part\r\nremarkably in building on the new focus of the\r\ninternational community on weak or collapsed States,\r\nsuch as Afghanistan, and mobilizing for their\r\nreconstruction. In the case of Afghanistan, the United\r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has played\r\na positive role since its establishment last March as a\r\npositive example of an integrated United Nations\r\nMission designed to address almost all aspects of the\r\nsituation.\r\nWe also concur with the Secretary-General that\r\n“terrorism has political, economic, social and\r\npsychological roots” (ibid., para. 1). While nothing at\r\nall can justify the killing of innocent people, we\r\nbelieve that, unless political issues that serve as\r\nbreeding grounds for terrorism are effectively\r\naddressed, unilateral military and forcible measures\r\nwill be able only to cut terrorism’s limbs. To address\r\nthese issues more appropriately, we believe that there is\r\na need for closer coordination between the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Security Council.\r\nAs to the Palestinian question, one of the\r\nlingering political issues in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, it is unfortunate that the Israeli regime has\r\nfrustrated and finally defeated all efforts undertaken by\r\nthe Secretary-General and his representatives aimed at\r\nalleviating the plight of the Palestinian people. The\r\nassertion by the Secretary-General, who has repeatedly\r\naffirmed that security cannot be achieved while no\r\nmove towards the restoration of the basic rights of the\r\nPalestinian people is in sight, has fallen on deaf ears.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nThe proposal made last April by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish a multinational force was a\r\ncourageous initiative, which, if implemented, could\r\nhave had a great impact in lessening the suffering of\r\nthe Palestinian people. Moreover, the effort of the\r\nSecretary-General to organize an investigation into the\r\ncrimes committed during the Israeli incursion into the\r\nJenin refugee camp — an effort that was blocked by\r\nthe Israelis — is also worth recalling.\r\nRegrettably, the Security Council has failed to act\r\non these initiatives or to follow through on them and,\r\nin general, the Council continued in the period under\r\nreview with its pattern of inability to put an end to the\r\noccupation of the Arab lands or to take any action that\r\nmight improve the plight of the Palestinians. It is\r\nneedless to recall that several actual vetoes or threats\r\nof veto lie at the origin of the paralysis of the Security\r\nCouncil on the Palestinian question. In the final\r\nanalysis, the failure of the Council to enforce the\r\nimplementation of its numerous resolutions risks\r\neroding its authority.\r\nIn the area of disarmament, like the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we are disheartened by the low level of\r\ninternational cooperation in relevant multilateral\r\nforums. Regrettably, as he states in his reports,\r\nnegotiations on a number of issues in the Conference\r\non Disarmament remained deadlocked. The\r\nunilateralist tendency is having an impact, thereby\r\nrendering the task of the United Nations in conducting\r\nmultilateral negotiations on strengthening the ban on\r\nweapons of mass destruction more difficult.\r\nMoreover, an inclination towards a unilateral\r\napproach is blocking the negotiations on the protocol\r\nof the Biological Weapons Convention. As a result, in\r\nthe period under review, the United Nations has been\r\nsuccessful in achieving only some progress in\r\nimplementing the Programme of Action on the illicit\r\ntrade in small arms and in the increase in the number of\r\nparticipants in the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms. Indeed, it is modest progress\r\nindicative of the long way yet to be travelled.\r\nIn the field of development, we concur with the\r\nview of the Secretary-General that collaboration among\r\nUnited Nations system, the Bretton Woods Institutions\r\nand the World Trade Organization should be continued\r\nand further augmented. Obviously, the aim of this\r\ncooperation is to achieve the internationally agreed\r\ndevelopment goals contained in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and in the outcomes of the Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development and other major conferences\r\nand summits. We also agree with the Secretary-General\r\nthat reinforcing the institutional capacity of the United\r\nNations regional commissions to implement regional\r\nprogrammes is an important and challenging task for\r\nthe United Nations. As a matter of fact, implementation\r\nis a challenge at all levels. Fortunately, the conferences\r\nin Doha, Monterey and Johannesburg have clearly\r\ndefined how to address the challenge of putting the\r\ndevelopment concerns of the vast majority of\r\ncountries — the developing world — at the centre of\r\nthe activities of international organizations, in\r\nparticular the United Nations. In the light of the\r\noutcomes of those conferences, the United Nations can\r\nand should further improve its work. To perform its\r\nleadership role, it is of crucial importance that the\r\nUnited Nations take concrete measures to implement\r\nthe outcomes of those conferences which relate to the\r\ninstitutional and organizational aspects of its work. To\r\nthis end, chapter X of the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development’s Plan of Implementation —\r\nwhich anticipates new changes in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations system — and other relevant\r\nconferences should be implemented in an expeditious\r\nmanner. Operationalization of those outcomes, which\r\nhave the endorsement of world leaders, would enable\r\nthe United Nations to succeed in the important aspect\r\nof its work: the promotion of development.\r\nFinally, my delegation has noted the emphasis the\r\nreport places on the efforts towards ensuring sound\r\nfinancial management, mainstreaming performance\r\nmanagement and consolidating the reform of human\r\nresources management within the Secretariat. The\r\nfindings and conclusions of various inspections, in-\r\ndepth evaluations, audit activities and investigations\r\nundertaken during the past year demonstrate the\r\nimportance of an intensified mechanism of\r\naccountability which is to be instilled throughout the\r\nOrganization. Such a mechanism, a key element in the\r\nsuccessful completion of the reform in human\r\nresources management, is imperative for full\r\nimplementation of all mandated programmes approved\r\nby Member States. We believe that the Office of\r\nHuman Resource Management should continue its\r\ncentral role of effectively supervising, among other\r\nthings, the recruitment process to ensure that, while\r\nattracting highly qualified staff, the principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution is respected,\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nincluding in filling vacancies in senior management\r\npositions. Strengthening the United Nations to be\r\ncredible and capable of responding to the challenges\r\nemanating from the ongoing globalization process and\r\nto be relevant to all Member States entails the\r\nenhanced capacity of the Secretariat. We hope that the\r\nmost recent round of reforms initiated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will help the Secretariat’s programme of work\r\nto better respond to the demands and concerns of\r\nMember States, particularly developing countries.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Denmark, to speak on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMs. Løj (Denmark): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The countries of\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Association country of the European\r\nEconomic Area Iceland, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration brought together in a\r\nunique manner demanding, concrete and time-bound\r\ngoals on peace, security and development as well as\r\ngoals related to the further strengthening of the United\r\nNations. The comprehensive implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration is an overriding priority for\r\nthe European Union. The reports prepared by the\r\nSecretary-General as input for the debate today\r\nunderline the complexity of the challenges we face in\r\nachieving the ambitious goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration two years ago. Progress towards reaching\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals has been\r\nsignificant but mixed.\r\nSince the adoption of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, we have made major steps towards\r\nsuccessful implementation. In Doha, we agreed to a\r\ncomprehensive development agenda with the focus on\r\nintegrating the developing countries into the global\r\neconomy. In Monterrey, we firmly established the\r\npartnership pact: the clear commitment by all\r\ndeveloping countries to take primary responsibility for\r\ntheir own development, ensuring sound policies, good\r\ngovernance, democracy, human rights and rule of law.\r\nWe would also like to pay tribute to the African leaders\r\nwho have taken an impressive lead in this regard with\r\nthe initiative of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. Developed countries have made a clear\r\ncommitment to lend support to the development efforts.\r\nThe commitments were reaffirmed at the World Food\r\nSummit in Rome last June. And the circle was\r\ncompleted in Johannesburg, which set additional\r\ntargets for sustainable development to supplement the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and which called for\r\npartnerships and implementation. Concrete action was\r\ncalled for — led by the developing countries — to\r\npromote sustainable development and eradicate\r\npoverty.\r\nThose commitments must be followed through\r\nwith perseverance. The European Union is fully\r\ncommitted to a comprehensive approach and to a\r\ncoordinated strategy addressing the interlinkages in the\r\nefforts to promote sustainable development. Economic\r\ndevelopment, social development and environmental\r\nprotection are mutually reinforcing components of\r\nsustainable development. The European Union stands\r\nready to assist in the efforts for development at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. We are the\r\ngreatest trade partners for developing countries, and\r\nwith the Everything But Arms initiative, we are\r\nopening our markets for all goods from the least\r\ndeveloped countries. European Union heads of State\r\nand Government have pledged to significantly increase\r\nour level of development assistance and to ensure\r\nimplementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative. I would like to reiterate those\r\ncommitments today.\r\nAlso, a strengthening and enhancement of the\r\nUnited Nations as an organization, at the Secretariat,\r\nintergovernmental and country levels, is a prerequisite\r\nfor success in implementing the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and meeting the goals contained therein.\r\nThe European Union is fully supportive of the\r\nSecretary General’s initiative to strengthen the\r\nOrganization and will do all it can to take this issue\r\nforward in the General Assembly. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration should be the main basis for continued\r\nimprovement of the Organization’s intergovernmental\r\nstructure, the Secretariat and the budget — and the\r\nprogrammatic process. The European Union welcomes\r\nthe fact that the Secretary-General, in his capacity as\r\nchief administrative officer of the Organization, has\r\ntaken important steps towards modernizing the\r\nSecretariat.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nWe also emphasize the need of ensuring\r\ncoherence between the follow-up to the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the other major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. We must also take a holistic\r\napproach to monitoring and evaluation. A coordinated\r\nand integrated conference follow-up is called for\r\nwithin the existing frameworks — both at the national\r\nlevel and in the United Nations. That goes both for the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly, the Second\r\nCommittee, the Third Committee, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and for reporting the resolutions and\r\nfollow up.\r\nThis year the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nfollow up to the Millennium Declaration focuses on\r\ntwo topics that need to be addressed as a matter of\r\nurgency: the prevention of armed conflict and the\r\ntreatment and prevention of major diseases, including\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\r\nAs for the prevention of armed conflict, the\r\nEuropean Union warmly welcomes the extended focus\r\nand priority allocated to moving the United Nations\r\nfrom a culture of reaction to one of prevention. The\r\nEuropean Union hopes that all United Nations member\r\ncountries will embrace the conclusions and\r\nrecommendations made in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on conflict prevention. We would support, and\r\nindeed actively participate in the implementation of all\r\nrecommendations both within the United Nations as\r\nwell as in other international and regional\r\norganizations and at the national level. The EU has\r\nembarked on its own programme for the prevention of\r\narmed conflict, with clear political priorities for\r\npreventive action. The EU will continue to work\r\nactively towards strengthening United Nations capacity\r\nin peace and security. The EU considers that the\r\nBrahimi report offers a unique opportunity to improve\r\nthe way the international community approaches peace\r\noperations, and it will continue to contribute to the\r\nimplementation of its recommendations.\r\nThe ability to provide humanitarian assistance to\r\nthe millions that suffer as a consequence of conflicts all\r\nover the world is also an integral part in establishing\r\nand maintaining peace and security. There are serious\r\ngaps in the United Nations humanitarian response to\r\nthe needs of the millions of internally displaced\r\npersons. To complicate things, there are still\r\nwidespread attacks against humanitarian workers.\r\nThose matters need to be addressed. The protection of\r\ncivilians, humanitarian workers and United Nations\r\npersonnel in armed conflict is first and foremost the\r\nresponsibility of the host State. But an enhanced\r\ninternational effort is also called for, and not least\r\nbetter coordination between all actors: local\r\ngovernments, civil society and the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe international community made clear in the\r\nMillennium Declaration its commitment to assist\r\ncountries hosting refugees and to promote the return of\r\nrefugees and displaced persons. We support ongoing\r\nefforts to strengthen focus on finding sustainable\r\nsolutions in the region of origin in the form of local\r\nintegration or reintegration.\r\nEvidence proves that there is a clear critical link\r\nbetween peace, security and conflict prevention and\r\nsustainable development and respect for human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms. That point cannot be\r\nstressed enough. The inter-linkage is unquestionable.\r\nBoth sides of the problem need to be addressed. The\r\ntask of achieving universal respect for human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms remains daunting. Increased\r\ncompliance with core human rights instruments and\r\ncooperation with human rights mechanisms are crucial\r\nin that context. But the persisting and grave violations\r\nof human rights in many parts of the world serve as a\r\nclear reminder that further international efforts are\r\nurgently needed in order to achieve universal respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General highlights\r\nonce again the devastating impact the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic has had on development in a number of\r\ndeveloping countries, especially in the least developed\r\ncountries and in sub-Saharan Africa. The EU will\r\ncontinue and intensify its efforts aimed at eliminating\r\nHIV/AIDS. We reaffirm the importance we attach to an\r\nenhanced and balanced approach in order to address all\r\ndimensions of the HIV/AIDS pandemic through strong\r\nand coordinated efforts covering different forms of\r\ninterventions, including prevention, treatment and care.\r\nThe EU action plan on aid for poverty diseases in\r\ndeveloping countries aims at providing a\r\ncomprehensive package of interventions for the three\r\nmajor communicable diseases: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis\r\nand malaria. The EU member States and the European\r\nCommission have committed substantial resources to\r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria, and we continue our commitment to helping\r\nthe fund establish itself as an effective mechanism for\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\ndelivery of essential support to those most in need. The\r\nEU underscores the need to implement national and\r\nsectoral policies and plans, in which universal access to\r\nreproductive health care and services, population and\r\ngender issues are integrated, with a focus on\r\nadolescents.\r\nOne issue has been at the top of the international\r\nagenda during the past year: the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe EU categorically condemns terrorism, whatever its\r\nform, motivation and manifestations. But with the same\r\nresolve, the EU emphasizes that the fight against\r\nterrorism must be conducted with respect for the rule\r\nof law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We\r\nacknowledge the central role of the United Nations, the\r\nSecurity Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee,\r\nand we urge the speedy signing and ratification of all\r\n12 United Nations terrorism-related conventions,\r\nespecially the one related to the financing of terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, the EU believes strongly in\r\nmultilateralism. We are ourselves proof of that. We can\r\ndo more together than by individual actions. We\r\nwelcome the commitment of the Johannesburg Summit\r\nto support the leadership role of the United Nations as\r\nthe most universal and representative organization in\r\nthe world. We agree with the Secretary-General when\r\nhe states that the United Nations is a unique instrument\r\navailable to the world for dealing with critical global\r\nproblems and challenges.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the\r\nrepresentative of Indonesia.\r\nMs. Rustam (Indonesia): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the annual report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization. As usual, it offers a\r\ncomprehensive and succinct review of United Nations\r\nactivities in the past year, indicating areas of success\r\nand failure and pointing the way forward. It is enriched\r\nand supported this year by the arrival of the first-ever\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the\r\noutcome of the United Nations Millennium Summit.\r\nWe thank him for both reports.\r\nThese reports remind us of the extraordinary\r\nchallenge to international security and stability in the\r\npast year, following the terrorist attacks on the United\r\nStates in September 2001, barely one year after the\r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nSecretary-General draws attention to the important role\r\nplayed by the United Nations in mobilizing\r\ninternational action in the global struggle against\r\nterrorism during the period, but notes that the\r\nphenomenon of terrorism has deep political, economic,\r\nsocial and psychological roots. We support the view\r\nthat Member States have the primary responsibility to\r\nprevent the conditions within their borders that can\r\ngive rise to terrorism.\r\nIn Indonesia’s view, terrorism is a heinous crime.\r\nWe need to combat that phenomenon and address its\r\nroot causes comprehensively. However, while we fully\r\nsupport the resolutions adopted in the past year by the\r\nSecurity Council in an effort to combat terrorism, and\r\nthe measures taken by Member States and regional\r\ngroups, we believe that the challenge before the\r\ninternational community — as the Millennium\r\nDeclaration makes clear — is, in effect, to make life\r\nworth living for all, so that terrorism has no hidden\r\ncorners in which to sulk or breed. We must commit\r\nourselves to lifting peoples from poverty. We believe\r\nthat the international community should pay very close\r\nattention to this point and accept, as never before, that\r\nthe issue of development is urgent, indeed a priority.\r\nUnfortunately, on the subject of development and\r\npoverty eradication, the Secretary-General describes\r\nthe prospects for meeting the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, one of which is reducing by half the number of\r\npeople living on one dollar a day, as mixed, with\r\nprogress in some parts of the world either hardly\r\nadvancing or falling back dramatically. We still have\r\n13 years to go before the target date, but as the\r\nIndonesian Minister for Foreign Affairs stressed here in\r\nthe General Assembly debate last month, the war\r\nagainst terrorism can only be won if we emerge\r\nvictorious in a more basic struggle, the one against\r\npoverty. In other words, it is not too early to remind\r\nourselves that we cannot afford to fail.\r\nIn this connection, and in recognition of the\r\nvarious issues at stake, Indonesia recalls that last\r\nmonth the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\r\nfor which we were pleased to have served as the\r\nchairman of the preparatory committee, reached an\r\nagreement on a global programme to reduce poverty\r\nand restore the integrity of our planet. If Governments,\r\nprivate business and civil society faithfully implement\r\nthe plan of implementation that emerged, the world\r\nnow has a good chance of making progress on this\r\nsubject.\r\nIt is our hope that this session of the General\r\nAssembly will translate the aspirations of developing\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\ncountries, expressed at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development (WSSD), into reality. We\r\nalso share the appeals being made by other developing\r\ncountries to our development partners and the\r\ninternational financial institutions to provide additional\r\nresources and honour the agreed targets for the official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). In addition, we\r\nreiterate that for the Millennium Development Goals to\r\nbe met, it is important to achieve an international trade\r\nregime where genuine multilateralism wins over\r\nunilateral practices and protectionism. We further\r\nsupport the initiative of the Secretary-General to\r\nestablish a Millennium campaign in the United Nations\r\nto continuously place the Millennium Goals at the\r\nforefront of public consciousness throughout the world\r\nand ensure that they are the focus of action.\r\nWe believe that this same approach should be\r\napplied to the subject of conflict prevention and\r\npeacemaking. The Secretary-General notes that the\r\nfocus of the implementation of the recommendations\r\ncontained in his report of June 2001 on the prevention\r\nof armed conflict has been on securing greater\r\ncooperation with Governments, supporting sub-\r\nregional initiatives to promote peace and stability, and\r\nencouraging the inclusion of conflict prevention into\r\nnational development programmes. We are in support\r\nof these efforts.\r\nThe General Assembly, along with other\r\nagencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations,\r\nhas responsibility for eliminating the root causes of\r\nconflicts, especially those relating to socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. The link between conflict prevention and\r\nsustainable development has already been established,\r\nand we call for action on short- and long-\r\nterm measures. We hope that, before the close of the\r\nfifty-seventh session, consensus will be reached on the\r\ndraft resolution on conflict prevention.\r\nIn this regard, it is a sad reality that the\r\ninternational community seems more predisposed to\r\nabsorb the enormous costs of conflict than to finding\r\nthe will to prevent it. If the Millennium Declaration is\r\nto have any meaning, if it is to make a resounding\r\nimpression in many parts of the world, it must begin by\r\ndemonstrating not just the capacity of the international\r\ncommunity to help find ways out of bitter conflicts but\r\nrather the commitment to prevent them in the first\r\nplace. In this regard, we are grateful for the recognition\r\naccorded by the Secretary-General in his report to our\r\napproach at the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN) to the prevention of regional\r\nconflict, an approach that focuses on economic\r\nintegration and quiet dialogue.\r\nWe cannot end our comments on the subject of\r\nconflict prevention without saying a couple of things\r\non the situation in the Middle East. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral observed that, in the past year, the political\r\ntension was aggravated by further violence in the\r\nregion. My delegation shares his view concerning the\r\nopportunities that arose during the year for progress\r\ntowards a political settlement. We refer here to\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002), which\r\nendorsed the prospects of a region where two States,\r\nIsrael and Palestine, live side by side within secure and\r\nrecognized borders, and welcomed the emergence of\r\nthe Quartet to help both parties transcend the cycle of\r\ndestruction.\r\nWe reiterate our call on those Member States that\r\nwield influence in the region to adopt a just and\r\nbalanced approach to the issue of Palestine. They\r\nshould persuade Israel to withdraw its forces from\r\noccupied territories and cease settlement activities in\r\naccordance with the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions with a view to giving peace a genuine\r\nchance. In the interim, we once again stress the urgent\r\nneed to deploy an international security force to protect\r\ninnocent civilians in the conflict-ridden areas.\r\nOn the subject of disarmament, it is disappointing\r\nthat in the past year international cooperation in\r\nmultilateral forums continued to suffer. According to\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General, negotiations on\r\nnuclear disarmament and a treaty on fissile materials,\r\nas well as efforts to prevent an arms race in outer\r\nspace, remained deadlocked in the Conference on\r\nDisarmament. In addition, the review of the Biological\r\nWeapons Convention was suspended until November\r\n2002, and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\r\nhas still not entered into force.\r\nWe welcome, however, the signing of the\r\nMoscow Treaty by the Presidents of the United States\r\nand the Russian Federation as a step towards reducing\r\ntheir deployed strategic nuclear weapons, but agree\r\nwith the preference of the Secretary-General for such\r\nreductions to be made irreversible, transparent and\r\nverifiable. We reiterate our call on nuclear-weapon\r\nStates to return to negotiations, and to pursue them\r\nwith a serious political commitment.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nTurning to humanitarian issues, we agree with the\r\nassessment of the Secretary-General that the diversity\r\nof the humanitarian challenges over the past year\r\nunderlines the need to further strengthen the\r\ncapabilities of the United Nations to respond, quickly\r\nand effectively, and to offer comprehensive protection\r\nto civilians facing war and natural disaster. It is\r\ndisturbing to learn that the challenges of delivering\r\nassistance and mobilizing adequate resources for\r\nunder-funded emergencies has not improved over\r\nprevious years, and that donor responses to United\r\nNations Consolidated Appeals remains unsatisfactory.\r\nWe note the continuing and growing use of the\r\ntool of partnerships in the work of the Organization.\r\nIndonesia is proud to be a part of these partnerships.\r\nWe encourage them as they nourish human\r\nunderstanding and support the work of the\r\nOrganization. In his report, the Secretary-General notes\r\nhis visit to Indonesia in May 2002, and draws attention\r\nto the efforts being made by the United Nations funds\r\nand programmes to support the Government’s pursuit\r\nof political, economic and social reforms.\r\nThe Government of Indonesia is determined to\r\npromote good governance and to establish a stable,\r\ndemocratic and prosperous society, and we are grateful\r\nboth for the Secretary-General’s visit and for the\r\ndeclaration of his intention to enhance the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to assist the Government of Indonesia\r\nin achieving those objectives.\r\nWhile this first report of the Secretary-General\r\nexplores the efforts being made to implement the\r\nMillennium Development Goals in general, it is\r\nenriched by a very useful statistical annex that tracks\r\nprogress in achieving the goals through the use of a\r\ncommon baseline. We thank the Secretary-General for\r\nthat detailed information, and we hope that it will\r\nenable Member States to keep track of yearly progress\r\nas we approach 2015.\r\nFinally, I should like to say a word about\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. We are in agreement\r\nwith the Secretary-General on the tremendous changes\r\nthat have taken place in the Organization since it was\r\nformed in 1945 and on the improvements that must be\r\nmade if the Organization is to continue to offer the\r\npeoples of the world its best service. On this point,\r\nIndonesia would like to emphasize the need to make\r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council a reality, not just a\r\nconvenient slogan. We share the view that no reform of\r\nthe United Nations would be complete without\r\nenlargement of the Security Council; the more the\r\nCouncil is seen as representative, the more\r\nauthoritative it will be. At the same time, it is\r\nimportant to remember that the Council’s authority will\r\nbe strengthened by its working methods and by its\r\nability to respond with equal purpose and fairness to\r\nthe issues brought before it. It is through the taking of\r\nconcrete action that the promise of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration — which is a promise to the peoples of the\r\nworld and to their posterity — will be fulfilled.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nthe representative of Brazil.\r\nMr. Cordeiro (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nannual debate concerning the report on the activities of\r\nthe Organization offers us an opportunity to reflect on\r\nthe direction being taken by the United Nations and on\r\nthe ways of expanding the limits of our collective\r\ncapacity to respond to the challenges that confront the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThus, we see this debate as a natural continuation\r\nof the general debate, as an occasion to draw\r\nconclusions from the analysis of the world situations\r\nmade by our heads of State or Government and our\r\nMinisters two weeks ago, and as an appropriate time to\r\nprepare to take decisions that reaffirm the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as the repository of our hopes for a\r\nmore secure, freer and more just world. Let us,\r\ntherefore, not look so much to the past — to the many\r\nsuccesses and the not-infrequent failures of the\r\nOrganization — but rather to the future, with a clear\r\nvision of our collective responsibility in preserving and\r\nactively promoting the principles and objectives that\r\ninspire the Organization.\r\nToday, we face a crisis of confidence in the\r\nmechanisms and methods of multilateralism. That must\r\nbe overcome. We also face profound discouragement at\r\nthe practical results of our efforts in the field of\r\ncooperation for development. That, too, must be\r\novercome. As the Secretary-General said, the choice\r\nbefore us is very clear: we can continue to invest our\r\nefforts in achieving peace, order and justice in the\r\nworld through negotiation and the quest for consensus,\r\nor we can return to an era when conflicts of interest\r\nwere resolved through other means. For us, the choice\r\nis clear: there is no turning back.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nI should like to refer specifically to four points.\r\nFirst, there is the fight against terrorism, which\r\nrequires much of our energy. The general debate threw\r\ninto relief the centrality of that topic. We are all\r\ncommitted unconditionally to that struggle; it is our\r\nconviction. The Organization’s immediate response to\r\nthe terrible events of 11 September was important,\r\nalong with the advances made in perfecting our\r\ninstruments of cooperation. Our efforts in that area\r\nmust be pursued with determination.\r\nHowever, the actions that we decide to take to\r\neradicate terrorism must be conducted strictly within\r\nthe limits of international law and of respect for human\r\nrights. In addition, we must not lose sight of the\r\nunderlying causes of the phenomenon of terrorism —\r\nthe fact that terrorism finds fertile ground in situations\r\nof conflict, extreme poverty, social exclusion,\r\ncollective humiliation and despair. To limit our struggle\r\nto repressive and security aspects would be political\r\nshort-sightedness, with dramatic consequences for the\r\nvery credibility of our efforts. Likewise, the security\r\nagenda must be part of — or at least must be\r\njuxtaposed with — an effective agenda of conflict\r\nsettlement and cooperation for development.\r\nThat leads directly to my second point. The\r\nresults of the Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nConferences are positive in that they continue to give\r\nthe proper priority to the topic of development on the\r\ninternational agenda. We now have a clear vision, and\r\neven a common platform, of necessary actions to\r\nconfront the challenge represented by the promotion of\r\nmore dignified living conditions for everyone.\r\nNonetheless, in that regard, we believe that it is not\r\nnew conferences or consensuses, but rather genuine\r\nreadiness and political will, that are needed to set in\r\nmotion the mechanisms that will enable us to\r\nimplement the existing consensuses. That thought\r\napplies to all topics, from trade and development\r\nfinancing to the fight against HIV/AIDS and the\r\npromotion of sustainable development. Unfortunately,\r\nthe lack of political will continues to increase,\r\njeopardizing the consensuses that we have reached. The\r\ndeveloping countries are individually undertaking\r\nefforts beyond their means to attain the goals agreed in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. But we have still not\r\nbrought about a favourable international economic\r\nenvironment in which to realize those objectives.\r\nProtectionism continues its persistent trend in\r\nindustrialized economies; the flow of productive\r\ninvestment in developing economies has declined even\r\nfurther; resources for development financing are\r\nclearly insufficient; official development assistance has\r\nreached its lowest levels ever; international financial\r\ninstitutions are not managing to respond effectively to\r\nthe liquidity crisis and to speculative attacks; the funds\r\nto combat HIV/AIDS are quickly running out; some\r\ndeveloped countries continue to boycott the Kyoto\r\nProtocol; and the Convention on Biological Diversity is\r\nunable to set in motion its mechanisms for the\r\nequitable distribution of the benefits of conservation\r\nand of sustainable use of biodiversity resources. We are\r\nexperiencing an ambivalent situation, with important\r\nconceptual advances regarding the needed policies and\r\nactions, combined with an inability to put them into\r\npractice.\r\nI turn now to the situation in the Middle East and\r\nto the problem of Iraq. With regard to the tragic\r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territories, the\r\nabsence of a political consensus on how to resume the\r\npeace process and how to find hope with security for\r\nIsraelis and Palestinians has led us to intolerable\r\ninaction. It is urgent that we find a solution, and it\r\ncannot be wholly delegated to a few actors. Rather, it is\r\na collective responsibility that rests with the United\r\nNations and, above all, the Security Council.\r\nIt is vital that the Security Council not confine\r\nitself to rhetoric and that it fully shoulder its\r\nresponsibilities, including through mechanisms that can\r\nensure implementation of the decisions adopted.\r\nIn the case of Iraq, we reiterate that enforcement\r\nactions considered under Chapter VII of the Charter\r\ncannot be taken without the authorization and the\r\nexplicit support of the Security Council. The fact that\r\nIraq or any country can repeatedly refuse to comply\r\nwith Security Council decisions is a source of serious\r\nconcern and is not inconsequential to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nThis is a crucial time for the United Nations and\r\nfor the credibility of its decisions and its working\r\nmethods. Just as we are debating this topic here in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, we would like to see the Security\r\nCouncil itself debate it publicly as soon as possible in\r\norder to provide a clear understanding of the individual\r\npositions of its members.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): The Pakistan delegation\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s report on the work\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nof the Organization and the report on the Millennium\r\nSummit.\r\nWe could not agree more with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that\r\n“no single country has the capacity to cope with\r\nthe political, economic, environmental and\r\ntechnological challenges of an interconnected\r\nworld”. (A/57/1, para. 4)\r\nThe United Nations is a unique instrument and a\r\nforum in which collective resources and cooperation\r\ncan be deployed to address critical global problems.\r\nFifty-seven years ago, the United Nations was\r\nconsidered humankind’s last best hope. It is, if\r\nanything, even more critical to humankind’s aspirations\r\nfor universal peace and durable security today. The\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nremain as valid as they were in 1945.\r\nToday, the shadow of conflict hangs over the\r\nworld. During the past year, tensions have escalated in\r\ntwo sensitive areas of the world — South Asia and the\r\nMiddle East. Our region — South Asia — is once again\r\nliving up to its characterization as the most dangerous\r\nplace on earth. India has deployed nearly 1 million\r\ntroops on our eastern border. It refuses reciprocal de-\r\nescalation; it refuses bilateral dialogue; it refuses third-\r\nparty mediation. The Secretary-General’s report states:\r\n“In South Asia, an abrupt escalation of\r\ntensions between India and Pakistan during the\r\nfirst half of msituation remains volatile, and an\r\noutbreak of hostilities between these two\r\ncountries with nuclear-weapon capabilities has\r\nthe potential to escalate with terrible\r\nconsequences.” (ibid., para. 24)\r\nIn his opening statement to the General Assembly\r\nlast month, the Secretary-General urged India and\r\nPakistan to address the underlying cause of their\r\ndifferences — that is, Kashmir.\r\nThe path to peace in South Asia is clear. It does\r\nnot lie in recourse to fraudulent elections in Indian-\r\noccupied Kashmir, to replace one puppet by another. It\r\nrequires, first, withdrawal of forces from the borders;\r\nsecondly, a ceasefire along the line of control; thirdly,\r\nan end to India’s State terrorism in Kashmir; and\r\nfourthly, a resumption of dialogue.\r\nPakistan will continue to act with restraint and\r\nresponsibility. We welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nrenewed offer of good offices to India and Pakistan and\r\nwould be happy to accept that offer. We hope India will\r\ndo likewise. We would also like to welcome the\r\nappointment by the Secretary-General of a special\r\nrepresentative for the Kashmir dispute.\r\nWe all have welcomed the positive developments\r\nin Afghanistan and the positive role of the United\r\nNations in this situation. But we cannot afford to\r\nbecome complacent. Security continues to be under\r\nthreat in Afghanistan from a variety of sources,\r\nincluding tribal and regional rivalries. Pakistan\r\ncontinues to believe, and to urge, that the international\r\ncommunity should deploy additional forces, especially\r\nin the regional centres, as a means of consolidating\r\npeace and security in Afghanistan and thereby ensuring\r\nthat the writ of President Karzai runs throughout the\r\ncountry. To the same end, it is equally important to\r\nsimultaneously commence the processes of\r\nrehabilitation and of reconstruction in Afghanistan.\r\nDespite the Security Council resolutions adopted\r\nthis year, again affirming the principle of land for\r\npeace and the creation of two States — Israel and\r\nPalestine — living side by side, the security\r\nenvironment in the Middle East has sharply\r\ndeteriorated, as noted in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nIsrael has persisted in its reoccupation and in the\r\ndisplacing of Palestinians, seeking to portray President\r\nArafat in an ignominious light but, ironically,\r\nachieving the opposite. Unfortunately, peace remains\r\never more distant in Palestine, with the parties far apart\r\non the structure and sequence of lasting peace in the\r\nregion.\r\nToday, the shadow of conflict hovers over the\r\nMiddle East and beyond. The course of events relating\r\nto Iraq could have a significant impact on the future of\r\ninternational relations and of the United Nations itself.\r\nIn our view, full and faithful implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and adherence by all to\r\ninternational legality are good guiding principles in this\r\nas in other international crises.\r\nThe Security Council has assumed an important\r\nrole in peacekeeping and peace-building in various\r\nparts of the world. It is vital to ensure respect for the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. This includes implementation\r\nof Security Council resolutions, in accordance with\r\nArticle 25 of the Charter.\r\nRecent developments in South Asia, the Middle\r\nEast and elsewhere have highlighted the continuing\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nreluctance of the United Nations fully to utilize the\r\nmodalities for the peaceful resolution of disputes as set\r\nout in Chapter VI of the Charter. We hope that the\r\nSecretary-General will find it possible to activate these\r\nprocedures where necessary, without the precondition\r\nof their open acceptance by all concerned parties.\r\nPeacekeeping will remain important for the\r\nmanagement of crises and the restoration of peace to\r\nmany fractured societies across the Third World.\r\nPakistan has historically played a major role in United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. We are at present the\r\nsecond-largest troop contributor, and we hope to\r\ncontinue in this role. We could do so more readily if\r\nour eastern neighbour ended its threatening\r\ndeployments and agreed to mutual military de-\r\nescalation.\r\nPakistan notes with satisfaction the efforts made\r\nto improve United Nations peacekeeping operations in\r\nthe past year or so. It welcomes the preparation of\r\ndetailed standard operating procedures to streamline\r\nthese operations.\r\nIn the context of discussing the role of United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report has omitted any mention of the United\r\nNations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan\r\n(UNMOGIP), which has been monitoring the ceasefire\r\nline between India and Pakistan since 1949 in the\r\ndisputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The\r\nstationing of UNMOGIP has on numerous occasions\r\nplayed a useful role in moderating tensions along the\r\nline of control. Pakistan would welcome a decision by\r\nthe Secretary-General to enlarge UNMOGIP and to\r\nstrengthen its mandate.\r\nThe United Nations role in disarmament must\r\nassume a greater salience than at present. The work\r\nbeing done on small arms, landmines, illicit transfers,\r\nand so forth, is important. The United Nations should\r\nnot, however, abdicate its responsibilities to address\r\nthe disarmament concerns that are central to the\r\nstructure of international peace and security, as\r\nvisualized in the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe United Nations must be able to substantially\r\naddress nuclear disarmament, other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the issue of missiles and anti-ballistic\r\nmissile systems, as well as conventional disarmament,\r\nboth at the global and regional levels. Apart from\r\nnegotiations in the Conference on Disarmament, the\r\nother relevant deliberative organs of the United\r\nNations — that is, the Disarmament Commission and\r\nthe First Committee, as well as the Disarmament\r\nsecretariat — should be able to evolve the new norms\r\nand approaches required to address these central\r\ndisarmament and security issues. Perhaps the\r\nconvening of a fourth Special Session on Disarmament\r\n(SSOD) could provide the mechanism to do so.\r\nThe United Nations humanitarian role has been\r\nreinforced in recent crises, including the war against\r\nterrorism in Afghanistan. Apart from clear\r\nidentification of objectives and parameters, in each\r\nmajor humanitarian operation, there is a need to\r\nstreamline the command and control structures and to\r\nclearly define mandates, especially where several\r\ninternational agencies, bilateral donors and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations are involved in a\r\nhumanitarian operation. It is also essential to evolve\r\nsome mechanism to ensure the durability of funding for\r\nhumanitarian causes, particularly when they are off the\r\ntelevision screens and the front pages.\r\nA conscious endeavour is needed to realize the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations in promoting\r\neconomic and social development as envisaged in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The international conferences\r\nheld in recent years reflect a United Nations consensus\r\non economic and social issues. We must translate this\r\nconsensus into action through an effective follow-up\r\nprocess. Pakistan has advanced some ideas to establish\r\na follow-up and implementation mechanism that can\r\nensure coherent, integrated and coordinated progress\r\ntowards the agreed goals endorsed by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe objective of achieving peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa has been a priority for the\r\ninternational community for over a decade. Pakistan\r\nsupports all United Nations initiatives that could bring\r\npeace and prosperity for Africa. We have consistently\r\nsupported United Nations peacekeeping operations in\r\nAfrica and have participated in these operations on a\r\nlarge scale.\r\nWe have a binding commitment to our partnership\r\nwith Africa. We welcome the launching of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which\r\nwe hope will open up greater opportunities for durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nGlobalization has opened enormous opportunities\r\nfor development, but its benefits are uneven and\r\nunequal. It has particularly accentuated the\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\ndisadvantaged position of developing countries,\r\nespecially the least developed. This is manifested in\r\nrising income inequalities, the digital divide and\r\nconcentration of economic power in a few corporate\r\nhands. Developing countries have little chance of\r\nintegrating themselves into the global economy, unless\r\nwe can have an enabling environment in which to\r\nwork. The need of the hour is an effective,\r\ncomprehensive, equitable and development-oriented\r\nstrategy to address the debt problem of the developing\r\nand least developed countries, including debt reduction\r\nand increased concessional financial flows.\r\nOne area that requires close intergovernmental\r\nand Secretariat review is that of human rights. It seems\r\nessential to organize the United Nations human rights\r\nmechanisms and the Office of the High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights in a rational and effective way,\r\nincluding the manner of its funding and operations. We\r\nare not sure that we can advance human rights by\r\nproliferating human rights mechanisms. In this\r\nendeavour, we could draw upon the efforts made in the\r\nrecent past by a working group of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights. We are confident that the new United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights will\r\naddress these issues energetically and effectively.\r\nWe have welcomed the Secretary-General’s\r\nsecond report on United Nations reform. Pakistan\r\nsupports, in principle, the process of reform at the\r\nUnited Nations. There are a number of proposals in the\r\nreport that will streamline the functioning of the\r\nSecretariat. Such proposals would receive our strong\r\nsupport. There are, however, a number of proposals\r\nthat impact the intergovernmental processes. We\r\nbelieve that these will require intergovernmental\r\ndiscussions, especially with regard to the financial\r\nmanagement of the Organization.\r\nWe have also taken note of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on progress achieved by the United\r\nNations system and Member States towards\r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration. We agree\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s assessment that the record\r\nof the international community in the first two years of\r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration is, at best,\r\nmixed. While some advancement has been made, the\r\noverall progress in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and other lofty objectives has been\r\nabysmally slow. We join in the call made by the\r\nSecretary-General to evolve a coordinated strategy —\r\none that harnesses the combined energy of Member\r\nStates, international institutions and civil society — in\r\nthe pursuit of the objectives of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nSpeaking here on 12 September, the President of\r\nPakistan stated,\r\n“We must capture this growing spirit of global\r\nhumanism to advance the quest for global\r\nprosperity and universal peace. This can be\r\naccomplished only at and by the United Nations”.\r\n(A/57/PV.2)\r\nThat is its central purpose, the reason for the existence,\r\nof our Organization.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I should like to announce that on the\r\nmorning of Monday, 7 October 2002, the General\r\nAssembly will consider the second report of the\r\nGeneral Committee as the first item.\r\nNow I would like to give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Mahendran (Sri Lanka): The Sri Lanka\r\ndelegation is grateful to the Secretary-General for\r\nintroducing his annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization and also for his first annual report on the\r\nfollow-up to the Millennium Summit, which focuses on\r\ncommitments made in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe two reports, taken together, provide us with a\r\nreview of our actions in the past year and information\r\non what is needed to move further ahead.\r\nThe Secretary-General has correctly observed that\r\nthe agenda of the United Nations is vast. The United\r\nNations agenda has many important issues. These\r\ninclude achieving peace and security, promoting\r\ndevelopment and eradicating poverty, all of which\r\naffect us all. International cooperation in these\r\nactivities is aimed at improving the quality of life of\r\npeople, wherever they may be.\r\nDespite serious setbacks for international peace\r\nand security in some regions, the United Nations has\r\nmade progress in bringing peace to other areas. The\r\ncatalogue of steps taken by the Secretary-General and\r\nhis staff, and the efforts they are making to achieve\r\npeace and security, are commendable. The advances\r\nmade, to name a few, in East Timor, Kosovo,\r\nAfghanistan and Sierra Leone, are important\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\ndevelopments in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nIn his report on the follow-up to the Millennium\r\nSummit, the Secretary General has underlined certain\r\nimpediments for better planning and coordination of\r\nUnited Nations efforts for peace-building and stressed\r\nthe need for increased support from Member States.\r\nWe in the international community should\r\nendeavour to make available to the Secretary-General\r\nthe necessary assistance to enable him to improve the\r\nUnited Nations capacity to maintain peacekeeping\r\noperations, including United Nations activities in the\r\narea of the disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration of ex-combatants. We wish to reiterate\r\nour support for the United Nations contribution to\r\npeacekeeping operations and to building the\r\ninfrastructure of peace.\r\nThe United Nations has been at the forefront of\r\nmeeting humanitarian challenges and protecting and\r\nassisting refugees and internally displaced persons.\r\nHowever, we note that the United Nations agencies that\r\ndeal with assistance to refugees and displaced persons\r\nare facing insufficient funding. We urge the\r\ninternational community to consider the provision of\r\nadequate resources to the Secretary-General for those\r\npurposes.\r\nIn this context, I would like to refer to my\r\ncountry, where, since 5 December last, when the new\r\nGovernment came into office, we have been\r\nimplementing an initiative to build up a peace structure\r\nin our country so as to bring to an end our long, drawn-\r\nout internal conflict. In this effort, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has been magnanimous. When requested, he\r\nsent a fact-finding mission and a needs-assessment\r\nmission, which he put together in little more than 24\r\nhours. That is the type of prompt response that can go a\r\nlong way in helping to strengthen the hand of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nWe are grateful to the newly established Inter-\r\nagency Network on Internal Displacement, which is\r\nproviding targeted support to teams, not only in Sri\r\nLanka, but in many other regions in the world —\r\nwherever there is a refugee problem.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s view that the\r\nresponse to problems of internal displacement rests\r\nprimarily with the affected country. But at the same\r\ntime, in areas where conflict has erupted or is ongoing,\r\nit would be very difficult for such countries to find\r\nadequate resources to help in settling displaced persons\r\nin the areas where they should be. We support the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts to obtain greater resources\r\nin this area.\r\nIt is in this context that I wish to refer to your\r\nopening statement, Mr. President, in this debate on the\r\ntwo items under consideration. You very rightly said\r\nthat we have to keep in mind that the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations is based not only on its ability to\r\narticulate political goals but also, and primarily, on its\r\nability to mobilize political will for their\r\nimplementation. You never said a truer word. I think\r\nwe should all remember those words. Without political\r\nwill we will not achieve what we have set out to do.\r\nThis is particularly true in the sphere of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe development goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration are of the utmost importance, and\r\nachieving those goals remains a high priority. Progress\r\nhas been made in some regions, but the progress made\r\namong the poorest of the poor — that is, poverty\r\nalleviation in the poorest countries — appears to be\r\nslow and marginal. The mixed results of the progress\r\nmade so far in meeting the development goals paint a\r\nvery gloomy picture indeed. For the poorest of the\r\npoor, who deserve immediate attention and maximum\r\nbenefits in the process of achieving these goals, the\r\nwindow seems to be closing rather than opening.\r\nUrgent attention therefore needs to be paid to what we\r\nset out to do at the most recent international conference\r\nin South Africa.\r\nWe welcome the steps outlined by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to accelerate progress to reach those\r\ndevelopment goals. Coordination among and assistance\r\nto all United Nations agencies that have set out targets\r\nin this field must be our priority.\r\nWe must strengthen action within the United\r\nNations — action on social concerns in relation to\r\nageing, population, people with disabilities, drug abuse\r\nand transnational crime, and in relation to the technical\r\ncooperation provided to Governments for the\r\nimplementation of social development programmes,\r\nincluding, in particular, HIV/AIDS programmes.\r\nWe are happy to see the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations Information and Communication\r\nTechnologies Task Force, which is now ready to assist\r\nin such areas as integrating information and\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\ncommunication technologies into national development\r\nstrategies. In doing so, the United Nations goal should\r\nbe to provide a major portion of the population with\r\naccess to communication technology at an affordable\r\nprice.\r\nIt is rather disappointing to note that there was\r\nlittle international cooperation this year in multilateral\r\nforums on disarmament. This has also left negotiations\r\non a number of major disarmament issues deadlocked\r\nin the Conference on Disarmament. We urge the\r\nConference on Disarmament to engage in constructive\r\ndiscussions in order to resolve the outstanding issues.\r\nProgress in implementing the Programme of\r\nAction adopted at the 2001 United Nations Conference\r\non the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons\r\nin All Its Aspects is noteworthy.\r\nIn this regard, we thank the Secretary-General for\r\nproviding assistance to Sri Lanka by sending a fact-\r\nfinding mission on the proliferation of illicit small\r\narms. The report of the fact-finding mission is\r\ncurrently being studied by the authorities in Sri Lanka\r\nwith a view to taking further action.\r\nReform of the United Nations also remains high\r\non our agenda. We appreciate the work done by the\r\nSecretary-General in the area of United Nations\r\nreform, as well as his continued efforts in carrying out\r\nthe reform process, the focus of which is to ensure that\r\nthe United Nations programme of work is aligned with\r\nthe priorities and principles laid out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Finally, we agree that the reforms should\r\ntake place within the United Nations Secretariat and\r\nthe General Assembly, as well as in its principal\r\norgans.\r\nMr. Singhara Na Ayudhaya (Thailand):\r\nThailand is pleased with the decision of the General\r\nAssembly to take up agenda items 44 and 10 jointly,\r\nsince the subject matter of these items is clearly inter-\r\nrelated. We believe that in order to make significant\r\nadvances towards achieving the goals set out at the\r\nMillennium Summit, the work programme of the\r\nUnited Nations must be realigned with the priorities\r\nand principles laid out in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe threat to international peace and security, as\r\nwell as to human security, posed by international\r\nterrorism continues to be of major concern to the\r\ninternational community one year after the horrifying\r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September. It is therefore fitting\r\nthat the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration (A/57/270) and the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization (A/57/1) both\r\nhighlight this important issue. On 4 October 2002, the\r\nSecurity Council held an open meeting in which\r\nregional groups, including the Association of South-\r\nEast Asian Nations, and States reflected on what the\r\nUnited Nations has accomplished in the critical area of\r\ncounter-terrorism in the past year. The prevailing\r\nmessage at the meeting was that a lot has been\r\nachieved to advance the cause of international\r\ncooperation on counter-terrorism but that still more\r\nneeds to be done. The Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nmay have provided the catalyst, but, in the end, it is the\r\nactions of States in combating international terrorism\r\nand — equally as important — the assistance they\r\nreceive from the international community that will\r\nmake the difference.\r\nAs for Thailand, we are strengthening our laws\r\nand our cooperation with the United Nations in the\r\nfight against international terrorism, while also\r\nintensifying cooperation at the regional and\r\nsubregional levels. And as the Thai Foreign Minister\r\nsaid in his statement to the General Assembly on 17\r\nSeptember\r\n“There is to date no indication whatsoever\r\nthat there is any trace of terrorist capability in\r\nThailand. We are making sure that no terrorist\r\nactivities or networks can be harboured in our\r\nterritory.” (A/57/PV.12)\r\nThe threat posed by international terrorism makes\r\nmultilateralism even more relevant. The need to\r\nenhance international support for multilateralism goes\r\nbeyond the calls for the strengthening of the United\r\nNations: it requires a reaffirmation of faith in\r\nmultilateralism and in the ability of the United Nations\r\nto discharge its mandate effectively and fairly. It is thus\r\nregrettable to note in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nthat the increasing frequency of unilateral actions has\r\nput existing multilateral arrangements at risk. This case\r\nis most clearly seen in the area of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. As indicated in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport on the work of the Organization, there was little\r\ncooperation in multilateral forums on disarmament this\r\npast year. The threat of terrorist organizations gaining\r\naccess to weapons of mass destruction surely should\r\nhave spurred countries to renew their commitments to\r\nmultilateral agreements regarding such weapons.\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\nHowever, the reality is that confidence in multilateral\r\nagreements on weapons of mass destruction is being\r\neroded and that unilateralism could become a first,\r\nrather than a last, resort. Nevertheless, Thailand\r\ncontinues to have strong faith in multilateralism and\r\nconfidence in the United Nations system’s ability to\r\nresolve all issues affecting international peace and\r\nsecurity and to meet other goals of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe promotion of international peace and security\r\nis the responsibility of all of us. In this connection, I\r\nshould like to recall the Secretary-General’s\r\nobservation in his report on the Millennium\r\nDeclaration that, in some areas of the world, there has\r\nbeen some progress towards peace, whereas in others,\r\npeace remains elusive. This clearly requires greater\r\ninternational attention and cooperation in conflict-\r\nprone areas. For our part, Thailand will continue to\r\ncontribute to promoting international peace and\r\nsecurity. In that regard, Thailand is proud and honoured\r\nto facilitate the peace negotiations between the\r\nGovernment of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of\r\nTamil Eelam by serving as host to the negotiations.\r\nHowever, peace and security cannot be sustained\r\nif we do not address the economic and social\r\nchallenges of a particular country or region.\r\nPeacekeeping and peace-building are thus becoming\r\nincreasingly symbiotic; we cannot fully have one\r\nwithout the other. A successful peacekeeping operation\r\nneeds to be complemented by feasible and sustainable\r\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and, sometimes, a\r\ncomprehensive nation-building effort. In keeping with\r\nthat approach, Thailand’s peacekeepers in Timor-Leste,\r\nthrough the United Nations Transitional Administration\r\nin East Timor and the United Nations Mission of\r\nSupport in East Timor, not only have fulfilled the\r\ntraditional peacekeeping roles assigned to them but\r\nhave also engaged intensively in rebuilding activities\r\nand other measures to support sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Thailand will continue to give its strong\r\nsupport to United Nations peacekeeping missions and\r\nhopes that all such peacekeeping missions will have\r\nadequate peace-building components.\r\nWhile the international community should\r\ncontinue to be engaged in maintaining international\r\npeace and security and be more vigilant in the war\r\nagainst international terrorism through multilateral\r\nframeworks, that should not divert our attention from\r\nother equally important and pressing goals, in\r\nparticular poverty eradication. During the past year, the\r\ninternational community has adopted three important\r\ndocuments that provide fresh impetus to improving the\r\ninternational trade and financial system and to securing\r\ngreater benefits for all economies in the globalized\r\nworld. The United Nations has played a pivotal role in\r\nbuilding up the dynamism of a global partnership for\r\ndevelopment and must play a more meaningful role to\r\nensure that the Doha Agenda, the Monterey Consensus\r\nand the Johannesburg Declaration and Plan of\r\nImplementation are implemented in a manner that truly\r\nbenefits developing countries. Thailand also shares the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that the right national and\r\ninternational economic conditions are key to achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals on poverty\r\neradication.\r\nThe rapid spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic is\r\nanother major threat to human security and is\r\nappropriately given attention in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. Such is the enormity of the pandemic that it\r\ncould potentially reverse what we have achieved in\r\ndevelopment. The fact that over 40 million people are\r\ninfected by the disease worldwide is utterly\r\nunacceptable, as well as unsustainable. Thailand is not\r\nspared by this scourge. But we have faced up to the\r\nproblem and initiated various measures to deal with it\r\nin a comprehensive manner. Our success in the control\r\nand reduction of the HIV/AIDS infection rate has been\r\nwidely recognized and recorded. We are proud and,\r\nindeed, grateful that the Secretary-General has referred\r\nto Thailand as one of the few countries where HIV\r\nprevalence rates have declined for several years.\r\nAlthough Thailand has made great strides in this area,\r\nwe are fully cognizant that the threat of HIV/AIDS can\r\nnever be overcome single-handedly because it is a\r\nglobal epidemic. So, we shall continue to cooperate at\r\nthe global level. In this regard, Thailand will host the\r\nXV International AIDS Conference in 2004, with a\r\nview to addressing the multiple aspects of HIV/AIDS,\r\nnamely prevention, treatment, care and support, as well\r\nas research and development.\r\nThe production and trafficking of illicit drugs\r\nremain a major concern of the international community\r\nand a major threat to human security in my country.\r\nThe drug threat, when linked to other forms of\r\ntransnational crime, such as money-laundering,\r\ninternational terrorism and illicit trade in small arms\r\nand light weapons, becomes even more dangerous. We\r\nare determined to counter the world drug problem, as\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.23\r\ncalled for in the Millennium Declaration, and the Thai\r\nGovernment has declared an outright war on drugs. To\r\nensure success in tackling this menace, a strong\r\npartnership must be formed domestically between\r\ngovernmental agencies and local communities, and\r\nthrough bilateral, regional and international\r\ncooperative frameworks. The expertise and financial\r\nsupport of the United Nations, particularly the United\r\nNations International Drug Control Programme, are\r\nvital ingredients in this partnership. For our part,\r\nThailand will continue to play its part in forging such a\r\npartnership. In that regard, we have initiated\r\nquadrilateral cooperation on the prevention and the\r\nsuppression of the production and trafficking of drugs\r\nbetween China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, and it is\r\nanticipated that the leaders of those four countries will\r\nmeet at an appropriate time to give much-needed\r\npolitical impetus.\r\nDespite much progress, much remains to be done.\r\nAttainment of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nrequires the existence of an enabling environment of\r\npeace, as well as a favourable economic environment\r\nand stability. We also need to ensure a fairer world\r\neconomic system and a more level playing field among\r\nnations. An oasis of prosperity cannot be sustained\r\nwhile millions are still condemned to a life of\r\nhopelessness.\r\nThe President: I regret to have to announce that I\r\nwill have to adjourn the meeting because of a lack of\r\nspeakers ready to take the floor now. Yet, I would like\r\nto remind Members that the schedule for the\r\nconsideration items 10 and 44 was announced weeks\r\nago and was confirmed last Friday in the published\r\nprogramme of work of the General Assembly.\r\nTherefore, Member States have had, in my mind, ample\r\ntime to prepare their statements. I regret to\r\nacknowledge that today we have heard only 23\r\nspeakers, 14 in the morning and 9 in the afternoon, and\r\nthat there are still 43 speakers on my list. We shall\r\ncontinue the debate on Monday morning, 7 October\r\n2002, at 10 a.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.05 p.m.\r\n"
