"United Nations A/57/PV.24\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nFifty-seventh session\r\n24th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 7 October 2002, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-154. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n02-62191 (E)\r\n*0262191*\r\nPresident: Mr. Jan Kavan. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Pfanzelter\r\n(Austria), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nSecond report of the General Committee\r\n(A/57/250/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nattention of representatives to the second report of the\r\nGeneral Committee (document A/57/250/Add.1),\r\nconcerning a request by the delegation of Cambodia for\r\nthe inclusion of an additional sub-item under agenda\r\nitem 22, “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations”.\r\nThe General Committee decided to recommend to\r\nthe General Assembly that an additional sub-item,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations”, be\r\nincluded as a sub-item of agenda item 22, “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include this additional sub-item as a sub-item of\r\nagenda 22 in the agenda of the current session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Committee\r\nfurther decided to recommend to the General Assembly\r\nthat the additional sub-item should be considered\r\ndirectly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider the additional sub-item directly in plenary\r\nmeeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nMembers that the new sub-item becomes sub-item (s)\r\nof agenda item 22.\r\nAgenda item 44 and agenda item 10 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/270 and\r\nA/57/270/Corr.1)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/57/1)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Japan.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Today, I should like to\r\nfocus on the following three areas, which are currently\r\nhigh on the United Nations agenda: international peace\r\nand security, development and United Nations reform.\r\nPreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and of their means of delivery has become\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\na task of the greatest urgency in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Weapons of mass\r\ndestruction are a particularly grave threat when they\r\nare used for terrorism. At this time, the issue of Iraq is\r\nof profound concern to the international community. It\r\nis essential that Iraq allow inspections without any\r\nconditions or restrictions and that it comply with all\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We believe that\r\nthe Security Council should seek to adopt appropriate\r\nand necessary resolutions in order to gain international\r\ncooperation in resolving that issue.\r\nThe relaxation of tensions on the Korean\r\nPeninsula is essential for peace and stability in north-\r\neast Asia. At the recent summit meeting between Japan\r\nand North Korea, North Korea expressed its intention\r\nto work with sincerity to resolve humanitarian issues,\r\nsuch as the abduction of Japanese nationals, and\r\nsecurity issues, such as its nuclear and missile\r\nactivities. Japan intends to undertake strenuous efforts\r\nto resolve those and other important issues in the\r\nprocess of the resumed normalization talks and to\r\nrealize a normalization of relations, thereby\r\ncontributing to the peace and stability of the region.\r\nThe recent relationship between India and\r\nPakistan is of serious concern to us. We want to urge\r\nboth countries to seek a reduction of tensions and a\r\nresumption of dialogue, not only for the sake of peace\r\nand stability in South Asia, but also for the world. On\r\nthe other hand, Japan welcomes the commencement of\r\npeace talks between the Government of Sri Lanka and\r\nthe Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which\r\nare meant to bring about peace and reconstruction in\r\nSri Lanka. Japan is prepared to cooperate in the peace\r\ntalks and in the reconstruction process.\r\nConcerning Afghanistan, it is important for the\r\ninternational community to promote cooperation to\r\nensure security and steadily to fulfil its commitments\r\nto assist that country. In this regard, Japan is now\r\npreparing a program called “Register for Peace”, to\r\nfacilitate the reintegration of former combatants. In our\r\nview, ensuring a seamless transition from humanitarian\r\nassistance to recovery and reconstruction assistance is\r\ncritically important for the stability of Afghanistan.\r\nCooperation for the construction of roads which\r\nconnect major cities is an especially urgent need, as is\r\na comprehensive regional development programme\r\nthrough, inter alia, resettlement of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons.\r\nI would also like to touch upon the situation in\r\nthe Middle East. It is crucial that the vision of the\r\npeaceful coexistence of Israel and an independent\r\nPalestinian State be materialized as early as possible.\r\nHowever, the most urgent task is for both parties to\r\nrebuild mutual trust and put an end to the vicious circle\r\nof violence. Towards that end, Japan strongly urges\r\nIsrael immediately to withdraw its troops to the line of\r\nSeptember 2000, halt its military operations and lift\r\nclosures in the autonomous areas; at the same time,\r\nJapan resolutely condemns terrorist acts by Palestinian\r\nextremists.\r\nLet me also refer to the situation in Africa. We\r\nare encouraged by the positive movements there, such\r\nas the establishment of peace in Angola and a partial\r\nceasefire in the Sudan. On the other hand, to our regret,\r\nefforts for national reconciliation in Côte d’Ivoire are\r\nretrogressing. Violence and bloodshed must be stopped\r\nimmediately. In this regard, we deeply appreciate and\r\nsupport the efforts made by the African people\r\nthemselves through, for example, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), which\r\nhas been seeking to undertake arbitration.\r\nThere is a clear causal link between development\r\non the one hand and peace and stability on the other.\r\nWhere instability, conflicts and war prevail, we see\r\nsorrow, tears, frustration, lack of development and\r\npoverty. Where there is stability and peace, we find joy,\r\nsmiles, hopes and steady development. Development\r\nalso has a lot to do with the enhancement of human\r\nsecurity. Incidentally, human security is a concept to\r\nwhich Japan attaches great importance, and we are\r\nlooking forward to the final report which the\r\nCommission on Human Security, co-chaired by Mrs.\r\nOgata and Professor Sen, is going to issue next spring.\r\nHaving said that, I would like to draw the\r\nattention of the Assembly to the following historical\r\nfact. In the 1960s, the per capita gross national product\r\nof countries in East Asia was similar to that of sub-\r\nSaharan African countries. Since then, however, East\r\nAsian countries have dramatically increased their per\r\ncapita gross national product, and in the past 10 years\r\nthe proportion of the population living in poverty has\r\nbeen successfully cut in half. Such sustainable growth\r\nhas been described as the “East Asian miracle.”\r\nNaturally, it is not at all my intention to be boastful of\r\nthe success of East Asia, of which Japan is a part. I\r\ncited the story simply because I thought that it must\r\ncontain a valuable clue which could serve as a useful\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nreference for us in addressing the issue of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhat is the clue, then? After a thorough study,\r\nthe World Bank came to the conclusion that this had\r\nbeen achieved through vigorous investment, sustained\r\nby a high savings rate and the availability of highly\r\nskilled human capital. I agree that vigorous investment\r\nwas a powerful engine for growth. But what is\r\nnoteworthy here is that the major portion of that\r\ninvestment capital came from the accumulation of\r\nsmall amounts of money saved by people with low\r\nincomes who believed in a better future.\r\nThe availability of many men and women with\r\nbasic education must have been another vital factor.\r\nThis was possible in part because many mothers were\r\nwilling to skip lunch in order to pay for the education\r\nof their children. It is those vivid, concrete human\r\nfactors that, in my view, have played a major role in\r\nachieving this success.\r\nOf course, I do not deny the important,\r\ncomplementary role which donors and overseas\r\ninvestors played in their development. In view of the\r\ntremendous handicap that many developing countries\r\nhave and in the light of the increasing interdependence\r\nof States, assistance by donors has become all the more\r\nimportant.\r\nIt is fortunate that we were able to agree on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals in this respect.\r\nHowever, it is crucial that we keep reminding ourselves\r\nthat these goals could lose much of their relevance\r\nunless there are many who are prepared to run,\r\nsweating and short of breath, towards those goals, and\r\nunless an equal number are prepared to cheer and to\r\ngive warm encouragement, supply water and towels to\r\nthose serious runners, or ensure that the course is in\r\ngood condition.\r\nIn this respect, Japan welcomes the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and\r\nthe establishment of the African Union as\r\nmanifestations of the ownership of the process by\r\nAfrican countries. Anticipating that African countries\r\nwill strive to make further progress in their\r\ndevelopment on the basis of NEPAD, and to help\r\nstrengthen their partnership with the international\r\ncommunity, Japan will convene the third Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD III) in October 2003.\r\nDevelopment must be pursued in a sustainable\r\nmanner. It is therefore important duly to follow up the\r\nresults of the Johannesburg Summit. For example, the\r\nSummit’s Plan of Implementation recommended that\r\nthe General Assembly consider declaring a “Decade of\r\nEducation for Sustainable Development” starting in\r\n2005. Japan is in favour of this recommendation.\r\nJapan, for its part, will host the Third Water Forum and\r\nits International Ministerial Conference in March of\r\nnext year.\r\nThe treatment of HIV/AIDS and other infectious\r\ndiseases is another major task. As the report by the\r\nCommission on Macroeconomics and Health of the\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) pointed out last\r\nDecember, public health is critical for the economic\r\ndevelopment of poor countries, and investment in the\r\nhealth sector is a means not only of improving health\r\nconditions but also of achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals with respect to poverty reduction.\r\nIn order to address the issue of infectious diseases\r\neffectively, it is necessary to adopt a well-coordinated\r\napproach that responds to the wide-ranging needs of\r\neach country, including education, prevention,\r\ntreatment, public sanitation, and research and\r\ndevelopment. Cooperation based on balanced\r\nconsideration to regions in need of assistance is also\r\nimportant. From this viewpoint, Japan will continue to\r\ncontribute to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria.\r\nLast but not least, I would like to address the\r\nneed to strengthen the United Nations. The United\r\nNations must focus on the new challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century and take action in a flexible and\r\nmore effective manner. The priority issues which the\r\nUnited Nations is expected to address are being defined\r\nby the Millennium Declaration and through global\r\nconferences. It is up to the United Nations to establish\r\nwork programmes and formulate budgets in accordance\r\nwith these priorities, and then to undertake\r\norganizational reforms. The report on United Nations\r\nreform recently issued by the Secretary-General clearly\r\nsets forth the direction which this effort should take.\r\nJapan welcomes the basic stance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and intends fully to cooperate in the process of\r\nreform.\r\nA large number of heads of State and\r\nGovernment noted at the Millennium Summit that\r\nSecurity Council reform is especially important in\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral stated in his recent report, no reform can be\r\ncomplete without Security Council reform. I welcome\r\nhis exhortation to Member States to move ahead in the\r\ndiscussion of this important issue. As the debate on\r\nSecurity Council reform is about to enter its tenth year,\r\nJapan believes that we should focus our discussion on\r\nsuch questions as the number of seats on an enlarged\r\nSecurity Council. Japan intends to make various efforts\r\nin this regard and hopes that the present report will\r\nprovide momentum to the discussions.\r\nThe Japanese Government also welcomes the fact\r\nthat the reform of United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, which is based on the Brahimi report, is\r\nshowing increasing results. Japan looks forward to the\r\nefficient and effective use of the enhanced capacity of\r\nthe Secretariat in this area.\r\nIt is important that we not view the goals\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration simply as\r\nends in themselves. By 2015, we must reduce world\r\npoverty and hunger by half, eliminate gender disparity\r\nin education and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS.\r\nThus, we can build a more peaceful, prosperous and\r\njust world and to that end, developing and developed\r\ncountries are equally required to do their utmost\r\naccording to their respective capacities. Japan will\r\nspare no effort to contribute to the work of the United\r\nNations in attaining the goals of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nMr. Simonovic (Republic of Croatia): The issue\r\nof peace and security was our foremost concern in the\r\npast year and remains so today. Our common vision,\r\nembodied in the Millennium Declaration for a more\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world, in which all\r\nhuman beings can live better and safer lives is,\r\nunfortunately, still distant. In this respect, some\r\npositive developments have been forthcoming as a\r\nresult of our joint action.\r\nThe fight against terrorism has also brought about\r\nsome positive results. The situation in Afghanistan is\r\nimproving, although not sufficiently. We welcome once\r\nmore Timor-Leste to the United Nations family, and\r\napplaud the persistent struggle for independence of its\r\npeople.\r\nWhat we should learn from these examples is\r\nthat, working together, through multilateral cooperation\r\ncan make a difference. As the Secretary-General stated\r\nat the 2nd meeting of the current session,\r\n“When countries work together in multilateral\r\ninstitutions — developing, respecting, and when\r\nnecessary enforcing international law — they also\r\ndevelop mutual trust and more effective\r\ncooperation on other issues.”\r\nThat is why the United Nations was important in\r\nthe past, and remains so, now more then ever. In the\r\nglobalized and increasingly mutually dependent world,\r\nserious threats to world peace and security, such as the\r\nsituation with Iraq, require our joint efforts. Croatia\r\nstrongly supports the implementation of all the\r\nresolutions and decisions of the Security Council on\r\nIraq. We hope that the United Nations will also have a\r\nleading role in resolving problems in another area of\r\nconcern — the Middle East.\r\nUnited Nations activities should be realigned with\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the outcome of\r\nmajor international conferences. We all agree that time\r\nhas come for implementation and tangible results. As I\r\nhave already warned in my capacity as President of the\r\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Council, we\r\nshould not measure the success of our work by the\r\nnumber of resolutions we pass, but by the difference\r\nwe make on the ground: that is, in the lives and future\r\nprospects of people who are hungry, have no access to\r\nmedication, and suffer from conflict or extreme\r\npoverty.\r\nTo date, the progress in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals has been too slow and uneven. In\r\nsome regions, such as East Asia and the Pacific,\r\nextreme income poverty has been reduced, but others,\r\nespecially sub-Saharan Africa, are falling behind.\r\nHunger is still a major problem for a number of\r\ncountries. Universal primary education, particularly\r\neducation for girls, is a goal still to be reached.\r\nHowever, the most horrific problem is high child\r\nmortality, with millions of children dying each year\r\nfrom diseases that could be prevented if there are\r\nresources available. For many countries fighting a\r\nlosing battle with HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis,\r\nthe establishment of the Global Fund to help national\r\nefforts is a welcoming breakthrough, and a source of\r\nnew hope.\r\nAlthough we cannot be satisfied with trends, most\r\ncountries still have a chance to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in the remaining 13 years, but they\r\ncannot do it alone. We have to build on Doha,\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg to reach these Goals and\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nto make globalization work for all. To this end, we\r\nneed to encourage building partnerships at global,\r\nnational and regional levels, and include the private\r\nsector and non-governmental organizations. Strong\r\nfeeling of ownership of the countries fighting for their\r\ndevelopment is key to their success. In this regard, we\r\nparticularly welcome the New Partnership for\r\nDevelopment in Africa (NEPAD).\r\nIf we really want to accomplish the difficult tasks\r\nin front of us, the United Nations must work together.\r\nCoherent and efficient policies, which can only be\r\nachieved by constantly improving coordination among\r\nmain United Nations bodies and agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes, are of utmost significance. To this end the\r\nfurther strengthening of the General Assembly and\r\nenhancing the Economic and Social Council is of\r\ninterest to everyone. The spring meeting of ECOSOC\r\nwith Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization should become a forum where stock is\r\ntaken of what has been done and new policies are set.\r\nCooperation between the two brings benefits to all.\r\nECOSOC brings into this partnership more\r\nrepresentative participation of States, and inclusion of\r\nthe private sector and non-governmental organizations,\r\nwhich are important in strengthening the credibility of\r\nglobal economic decision-making. On the other hand,\r\nECOSOC, through its cooperation with Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions becomes more influential.\r\nIn our efforts to contribute to a safer and more\r\nprosperous world, our special attention should be\r\ndevoted to the countries emerging from conflict. There\r\nis an urgent need to bridge the gap between\r\nhumanitarian and developmental aid and also to ensure\r\nthat post-conflict development is based on sound\r\neconomic and social policies integrated into the\r\ndevelopment plans of the concerned country itself. To\r\nthis end, ECOSOC has adopted a resolution which\r\nprovides for the establishment of an ad hoc advisory\r\ngroup on African countries emerging from conflict. We\r\nare right now in the process of establishing such a\r\ngroup on Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia welcomes and continues\r\nto support the valuable work of the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nand that of the Commission on Human Rights. In\r\ntoday’s globalized world, promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights, based on universal values, are our\r\ncommon tasks. The progress that has been made in this\r\nrespect is obvious, but there is still a lot to be done. As\r\nwas mentioned in the report of the Secretary-General\r\non the work of the Organization, it is especially\r\nimportant to include human rights into all activities of\r\nthe United Nations, including activities relating to the\r\nrule of law, sustainable development, conflict\r\nresolution, peacekeeping and peace-building.\r\nDuring this time that we are fighting against\r\nterrorism, and for the sake of the values we stand for,\r\nwe must be particularly sensitive to the protection of\r\nhuman rights. No fight for protection of national\r\nsecurity can be fought at the expense of human rights.\r\nIt is by promoting greater respect for human rights,\r\nalong with development, democracy and social justice,\r\nthat we will contribute to the prevention of terror.\r\nInternational instruments for the protection of\r\nbasic human rights, and punishment of their gravest\r\nviolations, are — although not without challenges —\r\ngathering strength. The ever-increasing number of\r\nStates Parties to the Rome Statute, Croatia being\r\namong them, demonstrates the commitment of the\r\ninternational community to end the culture of impunity\r\nand selective justice through the establishment of a\r\npermanent, universal court which would try the\r\nperpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity\r\nand genocide, irrespective of their status or nationality.\r\nThe entry into force of the Rome Statute in an\r\nunprecedentedly short time was an achievement in\r\nitself. However, new challenges have arisen with the\r\nrecent debate on the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction\r\nwith regard to non-Parties. For very pragmatic reasons,\r\nin the short run, it might be rational to search for a\r\ncompromise; however, in the long run, the clear\r\nsolution is universal participation in the Rome Statute.\r\nIn conclusion, the Government of Croatia fully\r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s efforts in realizing his\r\nvision of an overall program of reforming the United\r\nNations. World leaders, heads of State and\r\nGovernment, who were gathered here two years ago at\r\nthe Millennium Summit, reaffirmed their faith in the\r\nOrganization. We believe that, besides the\r\n“housekeeping reform” that is going on, the United\r\nNations requires major improvement and reform to\r\nsuccessfully meet the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. Croatia is ready to actively support such\r\nefforts.\r\nThe Nobel Prize awarded to the United Nations\r\nwas fully deserved. It should encourage us only to do\r\nmore.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nMr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, I wish to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report on the\r\nwork of the Organization (A/57/1) over the past year.\r\nWe also thank him for the informative report on the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration (A/57/270).\r\nAs aptly observed by the Secretary-General, the\r\npolitical and security landscape of the world stands\r\nmixed, rather than satisfactory. The objectives\r\nembodied in the Millennium Declaration appear as a\r\ndistant aspiration. But we should not lose hope, since\r\nexperience has shown that when concerted and united\r\nactions are taken, the goals are more achievable.\r\nNowhere is this more evident than in the joint efforts of\r\nthe international community, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, for attaining stability and democracy\r\nin such nations as East Timor, Afghanistan and Sierra\r\nLeone. These successes and others certainly offer a\r\ncompelling source of gratification and achievement.\r\nAt the same time, heightened tensions in some\r\ncorners of the globe continue to be of grave concern to\r\nus. This has resulted in conflict prevention becoming\r\nan important priority item for consideration. My\r\ndelegation considers the ongoing endeavours\r\nundertaken by United Nations specialized agencies,\r\nprogrammes and funds to integrate a conflict\r\nprevention perspective into their activities to be an\r\nencouraging development. The Secretary-General’s\r\ndedicated work in this regard, including his good\r\noffices and the contributions by his special\r\nrepresentatives assigned to conflict areas, deserve our\r\nappreciation. My delegation also appreciates the\r\nSecretary-General’s expressed willingness to assist and\r\nsupport all efforts aimed at fostering inter-Korean\r\nreconciliation through dialogue.\r\nSince the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the\r\ninternational community has been united in taking\r\nconcerted action to fight terrorism. In particular, the\r\nSecurity Council has played a crucial role in leading\r\nthe international efforts to combat terrorism through its\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee and Sanctions\r\nCommittee on Afghanistan. We further believe that the\r\nPolicy Working Group on the United Nations and\r\nTerrorism, established at the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, will serve as a reinforcing factor for the\r\nOrganization’s fight against terrorism.\r\nIn the area of disarmament and non-proliferation,\r\nthe lack of progress in multilateral forums in the past\r\nyear should not deter us from our efforts to address the\r\nissues of global security. We look forward to working\r\nwith the international community to achieve the\r\nuniversality of, and adherence to, existing multilateral\r\narms control agreements. We also believe that a\r\nregional approach has a great deal to contribute to this\r\ngoal, especially if such endeavours are harnessed\r\neffectively and take into consideration the specific\r\nconcerns of a region.\r\nRegarding peacekeeping, my delegation takes\r\nnote of the continuing efforts of the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations to enhance its capacity in the\r\nfield of planning, management and support of\r\npeacekeeping operations. We have always regarded\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping as vital to ensuring peace\r\nand stability in areas of strife around the world, and the\r\nRepublic of Korea will take a more active role in these\r\ncrucial activities in the years to come.\r\nTime and again, we witness the increasing\r\ninterrelationship between the problems of conflict,\r\npoverty and underdevelopment. That being said, my\r\ndelegation regards the United Nations initiatives in\r\ndevelopment, including the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, to be of utmost importance. During the past\r\nyear, the international community, developed and\r\ndeveloping countries alike, reaffirmed their\r\ncommitments in Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg, to\r\nshare the responsibilities and the benefits of\r\ndevelopment for all humankind. Now it is time for the\r\ninternational community to work together in a spirit of\r\ncooperation to achieve tangible progress.\r\nOf equal importance is the need to pay increasing\r\nattention to the vast disparities among many regions in\r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals, as the\r\nSecretary-General has rightly underscored. Given that\r\nAfrica lags behind in most of the targeted areas, we are\r\npleased to note the concrete action taken in the field of\r\nAfrican development, especially with the launching of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and the creation of the African Union. As\r\nreflected in the high-level plenary meeting on African\r\ndevelopment, on 16 September 2002, NEPAD should\r\nbe welcomed as a dynamic African development\r\ninitiative. In this regard, coordinated efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations system would contribute to the success\r\nof these initiatives.\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nIn the twenty-first century, development is very\r\nmuch linked to information and communication\r\ntechnologies (ICT). Against this backdrop, the high-\r\nlevel meeting devoted to ICT for development, held at\r\nthe United Nations in June 2002, was an important\r\nforum to reaffirm the multi-stakeholder approach of\r\nMember States, the private sector, civil society and the\r\nUnited Nations, all of which have a role to play in\r\nbridging the digital divide within and among countries.\r\nThus, the momentum created should be followed up,\r\naiming at making ICT a priority in development\r\nstrategies.\r\nHuman rights has never been on a firmer\r\nfoundation than in the present era, thanks in large\r\nmeasure to this global body. It should be acknowledged\r\nas one of the meaningful achievements of the United\r\nNations that it could mobilize the will and action of the\r\ncountries of the world to elaborate an increasingly\r\nrobust and comprehensive legal regime of human rights\r\nprotection and promotion. The latest addition to the\r\nbody of international law for human rights have been\r\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against\r\nWomen, the two Optional Protocols to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child in 2000 and the Rome\r\nStatute on the International Criminal Court in July this\r\nyear. The Republic of Korea appreciates the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations to assist and protect refugees,\r\ndisplaced persons and others in need of international\r\nprotection as a result of hunger, natural disaster, war\r\nand disease. The global consultations undertaken by\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees in commemoration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the Convention relating to the Status of\r\nRefugees was an important milestone, reaffirming the\r\nenduring importance of the Convention and the 1967\r\nProtocol, as well as highlighting the need to strengthen\r\nthe system in favour of the protection of refugees and\r\nother persons of concern to UNHCR. We look forward\r\nto cooperating further with Member States in support\r\nof the efforts of UNHCR to strengthen the international\r\nprotection system.\r\nThe urgent need for international cooperation in\r\nthe fight against AIDS has become a priority for this\r\nworld body. Millions of people throughout the world\r\nare infected with the disease with little hope of\r\nsurvival. My delegation would like to recall the\r\ncommitment made in the Millennium Declaration, by\r\nwhich the international community resolved to halt and\r\nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS. We regard the focus\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report this year to be most\r\ntimely, as it calls for innovative action on all fronts.\r\nLast but not least, we share the concerns of the\r\nSecretary-General that the progress achieved so far in\r\nimplementing the goals of the Millennium Declaration\r\nhave fallen far short of our expectations. In this regard,\r\nwe acknowledge the value of the campaign launched\r\nrecently by the Secretary-General. Ultimately, a\r\nsuccessful outcome will depend on the collective\r\nefforts of all Member States to fulfil their\r\ncommitments. For its part, the Republic of Korea will\r\njoin in the effort to translate the goals into reality.\r\nMr. Clodumar (Nauru): My delegation would\r\nlike at the outset to congratulate the Secretary-General\r\nand all those who contributed to the preparation of the\r\ntwo reports for the comprehensiveness and clarity of\r\nthose reports, which deal with how effectively or\r\notherwise the United Nations system has converted\r\nrhetoric and undertakings into tangible outcomes.\r\nIt was only two years ago that our leaders\r\ncelebrated the dawn of the new millennium with an\r\nextraordinary summit, here in the Assembly. It was a\r\nhistoric moment, celebrated with zeal, as it laid out a\r\npath for greater cooperation in our collective vision for\r\na more prosperous future. The very first annual report\r\non the implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, which is before us today, reminds us all of these\r\naspirations and catalogues the progress achieved to\r\ndate.\r\nConsistent with the ideal of meeting our\r\ncommitments, Nauru has been working with the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum, the regional organizations and our\r\ndevelopment partners to develop regional strategies\r\nand frameworks that will enable us to implement,\r\ncollectively and individually, measures that are\r\npractical and acceptable to our communities.\r\nThe 1992 Honiara Declaration, the 2000\r\nBiketawa Declaration and the 2002 Nasonini\r\nDeclaration provide the States members of the Forum\r\nwith the framework for strengthening regional\r\ncooperation within and outside the region on matters\r\nrelating to peace and security. Those declarations\r\ncalled for concrete domestic action in specific areas,\r\nsuch as the introduction of domestic laws to address\r\nmoney-laundering, terrorism and transnational crime.\r\nIn the case of Nauru, however, little progress has been\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nmade in the implementation of these undertakings,\r\nmainly because of resource constraints.\r\nNauru, together with most, if not all, of the\r\nPacific island countries, has done all that is necessary\r\nto keep the subregion safe from nuclear weapons,\r\nweapons of mass destruction and toxic waste by\r\nratifying regional and international instruments, such\r\nas the Treaty of Rarotonga, the Convention of Waigani,\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the\r\nBasel Convention on the Control of Transboundary\r\nMovements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, to\r\nname just a few.\r\nIt is regrettable, however, that our many calls for\r\nStates that have nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction to respect our desires are ignored. The\r\nproblem may well be one of attitude. Some of the\r\nnuclear-weapon States consider themselves to be the\r\n“good guys” and believe that they should not be\r\npestered with such commitments, whereas those they\r\nclassify as either “bad” or “evil” should be bound.\r\nSecondly, those same nuclear-weapon States consider\r\nthe safety and security of their own countries and\r\npeople to be paramount, even at the expense of\r\nneighbouring regions and their peoples. The\r\ndevelopment of “star wars” weapons can only reinforce\r\nsuch thinking.\r\nMy country, like many others, was also quick to\r\nratify the Rome Statute on the International Criminal\r\nCourt, even though the Statute has no direct relevance\r\nfor us. We nonetheless acted on it because we wanted\r\nthe instrument to be ratified and come into force and\r\nbecause we believe that establishing the Court will\r\nprovide a mechanism against impunity in regions of\r\nconflict, thereby contributing to the undertakings under\r\nparts I and II of the Millennium Declaration. Again, it\r\nis regrettable to see those States that have expressed\r\nreservations about the Court intent on making the\r\ninstitution impotent and preventing it from achieving\r\nits purposes, even going so far as to state that the Court\r\nis a threat to peace and security.\r\nNauru agrees that good governance should be an\r\nintegral part of economic and social development\r\nprogrammes and national development plans, and we\r\nare now increasingly looking at ways to improve and\r\nstrengthen our law enforcement mechanisms to make\r\nthem more effective. We are also encouraged by the\r\nincreasing participation of non-governmental\r\norganizations and the private sector in governance\r\nissues. Again, my country, in consultation with the\r\nPacific Islands Forum secretariat, is taking the\r\nnecessary steps to implement the relevant regional\r\npolicies on law enforcement, governance and\r\naccountability.\r\nThe themes in the report on the prevention of\r\narmed conflict and the treatment and the prevention of\r\ndiseases, including HIV/AIDS, are particularly\r\nrelevant. Nauru recognizes that health and education\r\nare fundamental building blocks for society, but\r\nwithout peace they become secondary issues when it\r\ncomes to the allocation of resources. We are somewhat\r\nfortunate in our region on this score, as the report’s\r\nstatistical annex shows that in terms of the major\r\nMillennium targets, the Pacific enjoys fairly high\r\nsocio-economic indicators. But our regional efforts in\r\nmaintaining and improving such standards requires\r\ncontinued support from the international community,\r\nparticularly the United Nations system, including the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund, the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme and the World Health\r\nOrganization. To date, their support has been\r\ninconsistent and ad hoc, but the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals fortunately provide a centralized\r\nand coordinated framework for assistance.\r\nSmall as it may be, Nauru is pleased to have\r\ncontributed to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nHowever, it is sad to note that donor funding for the\r\nfund is still limited, and that there remains a shortfall\r\nof some $7 billion. The way forward will require\r\ncontinuing bold and innovative action on all fronts by\r\nall stakeholders, and I would urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to keep up the good fight.\r\nNauru endorses the strong emphasis on\r\nintegrating the principles of sustainable development\r\ninto country policies and programmes. For us, one of\r\nthe most important goals of the Declaration was the\r\ncommitment in part III to address the special needs of\r\nsmall island developing States within the framework of\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action. We continue to\r\nadvocate such a framework, but call for an even\r\nstronger global response to emerging global problems,\r\nsuch as climate change and the loss of biodiversity. The\r\nrecent World Summit on Sustainable Development\r\ndeveloped a Plan of Implementation that goes some\r\nway towards achieving a concerted global response, but\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nhere again all of us will have to take strong action to\r\nmeet the commitments made on the environment and\r\non sustainable development in general.\r\nWith regard to the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe work of the Organization, I do not wish to raise any\r\nsubstantively different issues because I believe that the\r\ntwo documents are inextricably linked and can\r\nultimately be fused into a single, coherent and\r\nintegrated summary of the work of the United Nations,\r\nwith a focus on the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration Goals.\r\nI would, however, refer to chapter VIII of\r\ndocument A/57/270, on strengthening the United\r\nNations, which I believe does not adequately show the\r\ndepth of the change that the Organization has\r\nundergone. The ongoing reforms will help to meet the\r\ngoals of the Millennium Declaration concerning the\r\nadministration of this great body and I commend the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff for the work done to\r\ndate. But, of course, we should not stop here. For the\r\nOrganization to continue to play its envisioned role\r\neffectively, we need to continue efforts to revitalize and\r\nstreamline our work, including restructuring the core\r\nUnited Nations bodies — such as the Security Council,\r\nthe Economic and Social Council and even the regional\r\ngroupings — to better reflect new geopolitical realities,\r\nas well as to address emerging global issues.\r\nThe United Nations is an imperfect institution\r\nthat has its limitations, but the fact is that the main\r\nconcerns of the body are of relevance to all nations and\r\naffect our lives. The agenda of this Organization grows\r\neach year and every Member State has a stake in\r\nensuring that it continues to strive to achieve its\r\nobjectives. The only way for the United Nations to\r\nsucceed in its lofty goal is for us to remain strongly\r\ncommitted to the road map we adopted at the\r\nMillennium Summit.\r\nMr. Jalang’o (Kenya): Allow me at the outset to\r\nexpress my delegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the work of\r\nthe Organization during the past year. The report\r\nprovides us with abundant information for debate on\r\nthe item under review.\r\nThe Millennium Summit held here in New York\r\nin September 2000 was a historic event aimed at\r\ndealing comprehensively with the major problems\r\naffecting mankind. At that important Summit, our\r\nleaders collectively resolved on a common vision for a\r\npeaceful, just and prosperous world. It is therefore\r\nappropriate for us at this juncture to conscientiously\r\nlook back and reflect on the progress we have made in\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals.\r\nAs stated by the Secretary-General in the first\r\nannual report on the implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration, given current trends\r\nthe prospects of meeting the Millennium Development\r\nGoals are decidedly mixed, with marked differences\r\nbetween and within regions. My delegation notes with\r\nconcern that progress in much of sub-Saharan Africa is\r\nhardly advancing at all, with dramatic fallback in some\r\nof the critical target areas, such as poverty reduction.\r\nAllow me to inform the Assembly of the actions\r\nthat Kenya has taken towards the implementation of the\r\nGoals. We have set up a national task force comprising\r\nrepresentatives of the Ministry of Finance and\r\nPlanning, the United Nations system, bilateral partners,\r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector\r\nto spearhead the mobilization of national response,\r\nstrengthen coordination among stakeholders to achieve\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, and prioritize the\r\nnecessary development interventions and assistance\r\nrequired. The task force will also advise on the\r\nlinkages between the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand other national planning tools. We look forward to\r\nthe preparation of our first national report on the\r\nMillennium Development Goals at the end of this year.\r\nThe proportion of people living on less than $1 a\r\nday, as well as those suffering from hunger and\r\nmalnutrition, has continued to rise. This situation is\r\nmore severe in sub-Saharan Africa, where almost half\r\nof the population lives below the poverty line.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has further aggravated\r\nthe situation. HIV/AIDS has increased demands on\r\npublic health services and education, lowered labour\r\nproductivity and affected the supply of skilled work\r\nforce. The pandemic has also eroded the gains that had\r\nbeen made in the education of children and in child and\r\nmaternal mortality. Kenya therefore urges the speedy\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS and especially the mobilization of\r\nadditional resources for the Global Fund to fight Aids,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria.\r\nDeveloping countries continue to carry a heavy\r\ndebt burden. Debt-servicing obligations, accompanied\r\nby declining levels of official development assistance,\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nhave resulted in a net outflow of financial resources\r\nfrom developing to developed countries. This has\r\nimpacted negatively on the ability of developing\r\ncountries to provide essential services, such as\r\neducation and health, and hence on the achievement of\r\ntargets set in those critical social sectors.\r\nThe era of multilateral trade arrangements has\r\ndisadvantaged rather than benefited most developing\r\ncountries. Developed-country markets remain totally\r\ninaccessible to the products of developing countries\r\ndue to tariff and non-tariff barriers, such as subsidies,\r\nsanitary and phyto-sanitary standards, among others.\r\nPrimary commodities, a major export of developing\r\ncountries, continue to fetch lower prices in the world\r\nmarkets. These challenges have inhibited the ability of\r\nour countries to finance their own development.\r\nWe recognize the important role of regional\r\neconomic integration as a vehicle to peace, stability\r\nand development. The recent launching of the African\r\nUnion by our leaders is evidence of the commitment to\r\nputting the African people on the path to sustainable\r\ndevelopment. African leaders are committed to the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), a\r\nprogramme of the African Union, as a tool for\r\neconomic, social and political development. However,\r\nif NEPAD objectives are to become a reality, we need\r\nthe unfailing commitment and support of Africans\r\nthemselves, as well as of the international community.\r\nWe are convinced that Africa has the capacity to\r\nresolve the conflicts that have continued to reverse\r\ndevelopmental gains on the continent. Those conflicts\r\nhave been one of the factors contributing to the\r\nproliferation of small arms in Africa. At a recent\r\nmeeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the\r\nGreat Lakes Region and the Horn of Africa, held in\r\nNairobi last August, on the occasion of the First\r\nMinisterial Review Conference of the Nairobi\r\nDeclaration, the Ministers reaffirmed their commitment\r\nto combat and to eradicate the illicit trade in small\r\narms and light weapons in all its aspects. In order to\r\nachieve that objective on a sustainable basis, there is\r\nneed for financial, technical and political support from\r\nthe international community. Kenya would also like to\r\ntake this opportunity to thank the Department for\r\nInternational Development of the United Kingdom,\r\nCanada, Norway, the Netherlands, Safer World of the\r\nUnited Kingdom and Safer World of South Africa for\r\nthe assistance they have extended in the\r\nimplementation of the Nairobi Declaration.\r\nKenya believes that the recent peace initiatives in\r\nsouthern Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and Angola are\r\nsignificant signals and are a source of hope for peace\r\nand stability in the continent. We reiterate the\r\nimportant role of the regional organizations in conflict\r\nresolutions, preventive diplomacy and peacemaking. In\r\nthis regard, Kenya calls for the strengthening of\r\nregional and subregional bodies such as the African\r\nUnion, the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates, the Inter-Governmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment and the Southern Africa Development\r\nCommunity in recognition of their contribution to\r\npeace.\r\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals may not be achievable at the\r\npresent rate of implementation. There is no doubt that a\r\nmuch larger effort is needed from all actors — in true\r\nglobal partnership — in the mobilization of financial\r\nresources to fund the implementation of those goals.\r\nThe United Nations and the international community\r\nhave over the years accumulated a wealth of experience\r\nand policy frameworks to deal with the problems\r\nhighlighted in the Millennium Declaration. The\r\ncommitments of the United Nations conferences of the\r\n1990s, the special sessions of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly on HIV/AIDS and on Children, the\r\nFourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, if honoured and effectively\r\nimplemented, can put us on track to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): The\r\nobjective assessment provided by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the two reports under consideration brings\r\nus to a real moment of truth — a truth that may not be\r\neasy to accept but one that we must have the courage to\r\ntake responsibility for.\r\nSome of us might ask , what truth is that? I do not\r\nwish to repeat here all the conclusions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I will simply refer you to the key words that\r\npunctuate almost every passage of the reports under\r\nconsideration by the Assembly: limited progress,\r\ninsufficient progress, mixed results at best, very minor\r\nchances of attaining the established goals, and so on.\r\nWho is responsible for this state of affairs? Why\r\nsuch slow progress fulfilling commitments that we all\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nmade freely and voluntarily? What path should we take\r\nto correct this situation?\r\nI do not think that we have to look far to identify\r\nthose responsible. It is, simply, we the Member\r\nStates — to different degrees, admittedly — but we\r\nmust collectively accept responsibility for this.\r\nWe should, in this respect, recognize the\r\ntremendous efforts made by the Secretary-General in\r\nconducting the work of the Organization and in\r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration’s objectives.\r\nI would also like specifically to commend his spirit of\r\ninitiative and the relentless creativity that he\r\ndemonstrates in this regard. It is in this spirit that we\r\nwelcome with the greatest satisfaction his decision to\r\nlaunch the Millennium Campaign and to appoint, as its\r\nexecutive coordinator Mrs. Eveline Herfkens, who was\r\nactive at Monterrey. We are also glad that Mr. Mark\r\nMallock Brown, the Administrator of the United\r\nNations Development Programme, will be closely\r\nassociated with this endeavour.\r\nNevertheless, the dedicated efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General cannot be sufficient in and of\r\nthemselves, especially insofar as we have all failed so\r\nfar to live up to our commitment to give the\r\nOrganization the means to take effective action.\r\nThe path that leads in the right direction is no\r\nmystery. To achieve the Millennium Goals, the recipe\r\nremains the same: a global approach, a coordinated\r\nstrategy, the mobilization of wills and necessary\r\nresources and the strengthening of the leading role of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI would like, in this respect, to reiterate the\r\nmessage that Tunisia delivered from this very rostrum\r\nduring the general debate: let us work together to forge\r\na pact of international partnership, based on a code of\r\ninternational conduct, that will engage all parties in the\r\npolitical, economic, development and the international\r\nsecurity and stability domains.\r\nI would now like to turn more specifically to\r\nthree areas of the Millennium Declaration that are of\r\nparticular importance in our eyes: peace and security,\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, and responding\r\nto the special needs of Africa.\r\nWith respect to peace and security, we recognize\r\nthat the United Nations has made important progress in\r\nthis field and can pride itself on its considerable\r\nsuccess. It is still imperative, however, that the work of\r\nthe United Nations and, particularly, of the Security\r\nCouncil, be further developed. The Council should\r\ntreat all conflicts on an equal basis and with the\r\nnecessary diligence. The Middle East, Somalia, and\r\nLiberia — which are but a few examples among\r\nmany — deserve the same attention that the Council\r\npays to the other questions on its agenda. The Security\r\nCouncil must collectively take charge of the Iraq\r\nquestion. I repeat, the Council must retain collective\r\nresponsibility for the Iraqi question. We believe that\r\nBaghdad has responded positively and without\r\nrestrictions to the return of the inspectors, and we\r\nwelcome that. There is now room for a diplomatic\r\nsettlement that will spare the world and the region.\r\nOn the Palestinian question, the Council, here\r\nagain, must fully assume its role by enforcing its\r\nresolutions, to induce Israel ultimately to terminate its\r\noccupation of all the occupied territories and to return\r\nto the negotiating table. The Palestinians are committed\r\nto a political settlement that guarantees peace and co-\r\nexistence between two States: Palestine and Israel.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe purely and exclusively national interests of\r\nthe member States of the Council should not serve as\r\nthe basis for its decision-making, which is supposed to\r\nrepresent international conscience and legitimacy. The\r\nuse of sanctions must be improved and regulated, in\r\norder to take into account humanitarian considerations\r\nand the provisions of Article 50 of the Charter. The\r\nmembers of the Council should accelerate their work in\r\nthat regard.\r\nHowever, the most urgent issue, in our view, is\r\nthe refinement of our counter-terrorism strategy. It\r\nseems clear to us that, without a genuine global\r\napproach that would focus fully on the root causes of\r\nthat phenomenon, particularly those of a social and\r\neconomic nature, the global campaign against terrorism\r\nwould not have a good chance of succeeding. It also\r\nseems equally imperative to us to establish, as soon as\r\npossible, the appropriate legal framework, under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, by concluding a\r\ncomprehensive convention on terrorism that would\r\ninclude a precise and universally acceptable definition\r\nof the concept of terrorism. The sooner that is done, the\r\nbetter.\r\nSecondly, regarding development and poverty\r\neradication — this is the Millennium Declaration topic\r\nin which there has been the least progress, if any at all\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\ncan be shown. As indicated by the Secretary-General,\r\nthe situation has worsened in certain regions, notably\r\nin Africa. Paradoxically, however, that issue has\r\ndominated the agenda of the international community\r\nover the past two years. In Doha, Monterrey, Bali and\r\nJohannesburg, that question was examined from every\r\nangle and in all its dimensions and ramifications. The\r\nSecretary-General’s conclusions are truly disquieting.\r\nAdmittedly, we still have the next 14 years to\r\ncatch up, but in order to do that, we must take action\r\nand honour the commitments made, because, as far as\r\nwe are concerned, what is involved here are\r\ncommitments made at the highest level. They are not\r\nmere aspirations or wishful thinking, as some might\r\nwish to think. In failing to address that challenge\r\nwithin the fixed time frame, those who have not\r\nfulfilled their obligations must assume the heavy\r\nresponsibility of having further fuelled the root causes\r\nof all the ills from which our world suffers.\r\nThe margin for manoeuvre to achieve the\r\nMillennium Declaration Goals, which are a high\r\npriority, is fairly broad. We have institutional and legal\r\nframeworks that are already in place. We must make\r\nthe effort to invest in concrete action. Here again\r\nTunisia has made its contribution through the initiative\r\nof its President, His Excellency Mr. Zine El Abidine\r\nBen Ali, which is aimed at establishing a world\r\nsolidarity fund for poverty eradication. The creation of\r\nthat fund was called for by the Johannesburg Summit,\r\nand we hope that the General Assembly will endorse\r\nthat decision.\r\nThirdly, regarding meeting the special needs of\r\nAfrica, when our heads of State and Government\r\nidentified that area as an area for priority action, they\r\ndid so rightly, not expecting that the achievements in\r\nthe area would be so slight and disappointing. Africa\r\nremains the continent that is the least stable, the\r\npoorest, the most needy and the hardest hit by the most\r\ndevastating epidemics. Admittedly, Africans\r\nthemselves are taking charge of their own problems\r\nand have committed themselves to that end in the most\r\nvigorous terms; for instance, by launching the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and the African\r\nUnion.\r\nBut does that mean that the international\r\ncommunity’s responsibility for the African continent is\r\nthereby reduced? Definitely not. On the contrary, we\r\nbelieve that the international community, with all its\r\ncomponents and mechanisms, must redouble its efforts\r\nand pledge itself today, before it is too late, to assist in\r\nAfrica’s recovery. Such international assistance must\r\nbe provided in a way that responds to the priorities\r\nidentified by Africans themselves, and should not be\r\ntied to pre-conditions that are not related to the\r\ndemands of the African reality. We also believe that it\r\nis necessary to strengthen coordination and\r\nconsultation with regional and subregional African\r\norganizations, which are in the best position to identify\r\nAfrica’s real needs and their appropriate responses.\r\nThe debate on the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nthe work of the Organization and the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration is an opportunity for\r\ngenuine self-criticism, with a view to generating real\r\nmomentum to honour the words of our heads of State\r\nand Government, who have shown us the path towards\r\na better world.\r\nFor its part, Tunisia will continue to devote itself\r\nto meeting its obligations, and will maintain and\r\nreinforce, as needed, its cooperation with all\r\nmultilateral institutions, as well as with its regional\r\npartners, in order to make the Millennium Declaration\r\nGoals a reality, instead of simply a collection of\r\npromises and good intentions doomed never to be\r\ntranslated into action.\r\nMr. Nambiar (India): My delegation wishes to\r\ncongratulate the President on the skilful way in which\r\nhe has been conducting the work of this session. We\r\nthank the Secretary-General for the comprehensive\r\noverview provided to us of the activities of the\r\nOrganization over the past year in various areas. The\r\nreport also highlights many major challenges ahead of\r\nus. Since time is limited, I shall refer to only a few. To\r\nsave time, I shall also skip some paragraphs in the\r\ncirculated text.\r\nThe Secretary-General has reminded us of the\r\nneed to renew our faith in United Nations-centred\r\nmultilateralism. The terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\nlast year demonstrated that the phenomenon of\r\nterrorism can be tackled only through a multilateral\r\napproach. No country is immune to terrorism and no\r\ncountry can tackle it alone. While reminding us of the\r\nclear interest and responsibility of all States to uphold\r\ninternational law and maintain international order, the\r\nSecretary-General, in his address, also calls upon\r\nStates to agree to the exercise of sovereignty together\r\nin order to gain a hold over problems that defeat each\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nseparately. We take those words as a powerful message\r\npointing to the global challenges facing us today that\r\ndemand action and solutions that acquire legitimacy\r\nwhen tackled through multilateral cooperative efforts.\r\nAdmittedly, the credibility of the world\r\nOrganization rests upon its ability to impart momentum\r\nor dynamism to the peace processes in areas of tension\r\nor potential conflict around the world. In this, the\r\nOrganization has generally worked with deliberation\r\nand discretion. In Afghanistan, the Afghan parties were\r\nbrought together in Bonn in December 2001, under\r\nUnited Nations auspices, and were able to agree on a\r\npolitical process that has now led to the establishment\r\nof a transitional authority under President Karzai. After\r\nyears of conflict, there now appears a promising, but\r\ntenuous, prospect for peace. In the Middle East the\r\nUnited Nations has given cautious support to the\r\nactions of the Quartet, of which it is a constituent.\r\nImplied in this approach is the recognition by the\r\nUnited Nations of the need for a sophisticated and\r\ndifferentiated approach to the many problems that beset\r\nthe world today.\r\nIn his statement introducing his report on the\r\nwork of the Organization, the Secretary-General\r\nreferred to the situation in South Asia, stating that it\r\nremains perilous and that the underlying causes must\r\nbe addressed. In our view, the underlying causes are\r\ncross-border terrorism and the unwillingness of\r\nconcerned establishments in our neighbourhood to\r\ndismantle the infrastructure of terrorism, which has\r\nbeen nurtured over almost two decades. Other\r\nunderlying causes include a policy of compulsive\r\nhostility, the absence of democratic governance and the\r\nunwillingness of a military establishment to subject\r\nitself to civilian control. It is only when these\r\nunderlying causes are addressed that the commonalities\r\nbetween the nation-building interests of the peoples of\r\nthe subcontinent can be rediscovered and that the\r\nproblem areas in the relationship between the countries\r\ncan be addressed and resolved. The Secretary-General\r\nhas wisely chosen to exhort both parties in South Asia\r\nto resume bilateral dialogue and to resolve differences\r\nthrough peaceful means. In our view, apart from being\r\nthe only viable option, the bilateral route is also the\r\nroute to which both countries remain formally\r\ncommitted.\r\nEfforts to sidetrack this essential premise were at\r\nthe root of the so-called nuclear scare in the region a\r\nfew months ago. We do not deny the severity of the\r\npolitical tensions that were generated in the\r\nsubcontinent as a result of the mindless acts of\r\nterrorism perpetrated against important symbols of\r\nIndian democracy and nationhood. The measures\r\nadopted by the Government of India were deliberate\r\nbut restrained, as would befit a responsible democracy\r\naccountable to its people. As mentioned by the\r\nSecretary-General himself, the efforts of some well-\r\nplaced Member States did contribute to a temporary\r\neasing of the overall situation based, on express\r\ncommitments to end cross-border infiltrations\r\npermanently. But, again, those commitments remain\r\nunimplemented or have been backtracked upon.\r\nWithin the United Nations system, the artificial\r\nscare created recently by declaring a phase-III\r\nemergency or security alert covering United Nations\r\npersonnel in India was not without its whimsical\r\nsidelights. Family members of United Nations staff\r\nmembers in New York vacationing in India at official\r\nexpense were forced to displace themselves from India,\r\nat further official expense, to hotels in Thailand for\r\nperiods extending for weeks. Whatever the\r\nimplications that may have had for the expenses borne\r\nby the Organization, for India this development\r\nprovided a telling insight into the political judgment\r\nand evaluative capacities of the United Nations\r\nSecretariat at senior levels in the political and security\r\ndivisions.\r\nIndia has been consistently and totally committed\r\nto the cause of United Nations peacekeeping. That\r\ncommitment is unwavering and undiminished, and will\r\ncontinue. India has contributed more than 60,000\r\ntroops and police personnel to 35 United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations, with 109 Indian peacekeepers\r\nhaving made the supreme sacrifice in the service of the\r\nUnited Nations. We have also pledged a brigade under\r\nthe United Nations Standby Arrangements System, as\r\nwell as 60 officers to the on-call list for a generic\r\nmission headquarters. Overall, we have been among\r\nthe largest contributors of troops, having participated\r\nin almost every major peacekeeping operation. We\r\ntherefore speak with considerable knowledge and from\r\na wealth of accumulated experience, with the intent of\r\nstrengthening United Nations peacekeeping practice\r\nand procedure and making peacekeeping operations\r\nmore efficient and effective.\r\nWhile recognizing the progress made in\r\nimproving the management of peace operations, some\r\nproblems remain. In paragraph 53 of his report, the\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nSecretary-General refers to the shortage of\r\npeacekeepers. In his report, Mr. Brahimi observed that\r\n70 per cent of troop contributions come from\r\ndeveloping countries. This is untenable, and reflects\r\npoorly on the commitment of those who have a special\r\nresponsibility in the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. The lack of political will among certain\r\nMember States detracts from the universal character of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. They also lay\r\nthemselves open to the charge of double standards,\r\nwhereby they are prepared to contribute to operations\r\nin Europe but are reluctant to do so in Africa. This\r\ncommitment gap needs to be addressed.\r\nWe welcome the attention paid by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the issue of terrorism in his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nTerrorism, as is so rightly stated in the report, threatens\r\nsovereignty, democracy, human rights, the rule of law\r\nand the other principles enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. Given the horrific dimensions it has\r\nassumed, it represents a central challenge for the\r\ninternational community today.\r\nTerrorism seeks immunity for itself by invoking\r\narguments about its root causes. Those arguments\r\nprovide it with licence for attempting to disrupt\r\ndemocratic processes and for killing civilians,\r\nincluding women and children. Terrorism also draws\r\nsustenance and justification from those who say that\r\nwhile acts of terrorism by groups should be\r\ncondemned, they should not be outlawed. We have\r\nheard arguments to the effect that freedom struggles\r\nshould not be de-legitimized by efforts to link them to\r\nterrorism. We would argue that terrorism should not be\r\nlegitimized by pseudo-justifications on the grounds of\r\nthe so-called freedom struggles within independent\r\nnations.\r\nTerrorists are often harboured by States. They are\r\nfinanced, trained, armed and provided sanctuary by\r\nthem. The first and foremost requirement, if we are to\r\nmake any progress in the fight against terrorism, would\r\nbe to focus on groups known to perpetuate terrorism\r\nand on States known to sponsor them. We have\r\nwelcomed the creation of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee by the Security Council. We look forward\r\nto a meaningful contribution by the Committee to the\r\nfight against terrorism. That would go a long way\r\ntowards the preservation of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nIndia has been a victim of State-sponsored, cross-\r\nborder terrorism for almost two decades now, with a\r\ntoll in the tens of thousands. The most recent terrorist\r\nattack, at a place of worship in Gujarat, left a trail of\r\ndeath and destruction in its wake. The people of the\r\nstate of Jammu and Kashmir demonstrated their resolve\r\nto exercise electoral rights to choose their\r\nrepresentatives, despite attempts to undermine the same\r\nby a campaign of intimidation and terror inspired,\r\ninstigated and executed from across the border. The\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir, in the tradition of all\r\ndemocratic societies, have defied such provocations\r\nand chosen to adhere to the democratic path. This may\r\nnot be palatable to those who, despite their occasional\r\nlapses into democracy, are unaccustomed to the values\r\nof tolerance, pluralism and respect for diversity that\r\ncharacterize a truly democratic political culture.\r\nIndia, along with other developing countries,\r\nattaches the highest importance to the achievement of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Monterrey\r\nConference and the Johannesburg Summit were to have\r\nprovided the means for achieving those Goals. While\r\ntheir outcomes were encouraging in many ways, they\r\nhave fallen short of the level of commitment required\r\nfrom the international community. There is\r\nnevertheless a need to move ahead and translate the\r\ncommitments that we have undertaken into concrete\r\naction. We are acutely aware that we have now only 12\r\nyears to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe find that the section of the report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration dealing\r\nwith human rights, democracy and good governance\r\nfocuses nearly exclusively on international\r\nconventions, legal frameworks and world conferences.\r\nThis is disappointing, as selective solutions that rely\r\nexclusively on strengthening the legal order for the\r\npromotion of human rights or on enforcement-minded\r\napproaches to redress human rights grievances by\r\nthemselves contribute little to any durable culture of\r\nhuman rights. We are also surprised that the same\r\nsection of the report makes no reference to the\r\nusurpation of power by militaries or to its perpetuation\r\nthrough legal framework orders. In our view, this has a\r\nbearing on the subject of democracy, good governance\r\nand human rights.\r\nWe welcome the global campaign regarding the\r\nMillennium Development Goals that has been initiated\r\nby the Secretary-General, as well as the appointment of\r\nMs. Eveline Herfkens as its Executive Coordinator.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nThe Zedillo High-Level Group has estimated that an\r\nadditional $50 billion in official development\r\nassistance alone is required if the Goals are to be met.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals were not adopted\r\nin a meeting of the G-77. They were adopted by a\r\nSummit held in the United Nations, and are contained\r\nin the Millennium Declaration, which represents a\r\nglobal compact bringing together all Member States,\r\ndeveloped and developing. We would, in this context,\r\nurge country-level reporting on official development\r\nassistance, debt relief and market access for our\r\ndeveloped partners as well. Such reports should help to\r\nfoster and focus public debate in developed countries,\r\nre-energize a broad political constituency in favour of\r\ndevelopment and create the necessary links between\r\nnational priorities and targets assumed at the global\r\nlevel. It is only by having country-level reporting on\r\nthe fulfilment of pledges undertaken by developed\r\ncountries that the Secretary-General’s campaign can be\r\ntruly global.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour appreciation for the continuous efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations system to respond to humanitarian\r\ncrises. In Afghanistan, in particular, the United Nations\r\nsystem has demonstrated its ability to quickly and\r\neffectively face up to the most daunting challenges.\r\nThe United Nations Development Programme is\r\nplaying a leading role in meeting humanitarian,\r\nrecovery and rehabilitation requirements. The United\r\nNations Children’s Fund has supported the back-to-\r\nschool campaign which has ensured that 3 million\r\nchildren have returned to school. The World Food\r\nProgramme has launched one of its largest relief\r\nprogrammes in Afghanistan, providing the difference\r\nbetween starvation and survival.\r\nWe commend the United Nations system for these\r\nachievements. We hasten, however, to strike a note of\r\ncaution. The Secretary-General has often reminded us\r\nof what happens when a crisis stops attracting media\r\nattention. We must not allow that to happen in\r\nAfghanistan as that would have a bearing on the\r\ncredibility the United Nations system enjoys in the\r\nfield of humanitarian assistance.\r\nWe are happy to note the support provided by the\r\nUnited Nations system for the development of Africa.\r\nThe findings of the independent review, commissioned\r\nby the Secretary-General on the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa, will be a useful\r\nguide when we consider the support that the\r\ninternational community should provide to the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). We\r\nare happy that the Food and Agriculture Organization\r\n(FAO) has already initiated a joint programme with\r\nNEPAD. The United Nations system should work\r\nclosely with African Governments and its support to\r\nNEPAD should be Africa-driven. Any deviation would\r\nonly be seen as an attempt to impose an external\r\nagenda. This, we hope, will not happen.\r\nMr. Mmualefe (Botswana): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing the appreciation of my delegation to the\r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive, concise and insightful report on the\r\nFollow-up to the Outcome of the Millennium Summit,\r\nwhich he introduced to the General Assembly last\r\nweek.\r\nThe report focuses attention on very important\r\nissues of our time. These were discussed by world\r\nleaders during the Millennium Summit, where they\r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration, setting out clear\r\ngoals and commitments as well as targets for attaining\r\nthem.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report gives a good\r\naccount of accomplishments by, and shortcomings of,\r\nthe United Nations and its Member States in pursuit of\r\nthe Millennium Goals. Through the report, the\r\nSecretary-General also provides invaluable insights on\r\nwhat could be done to achieve progress. This is indeed\r\nan important first step, which requires the support of\r\nthe international community so that it does not become\r\nan end in itself but a catalyst for more concerted effort.\r\nThe challenges facing humanity are as varied as\r\nthey are complex, and require concerted individual and\r\nglobal responses — and what a better place to start\r\nthan with the United Nations in cooperation with other\r\nstakeholders? After all, the United Nations is the only\r\ninstitution that can effectively foster partnership,\r\ncooperation and multilateralism.\r\nThe challenges that face developing countries,\r\nparticularly Africa, are even more daunting. These\r\ninclude the high level of poverty, which is exacerbated\r\nby the unfavourable economic environment and\r\nconflicts, and compounded by the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic.\r\nThe report’s statistical analysis on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals paints a grim picture of Africa’s\r\nperformance with respect to various indicators,\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\ncompared to other regions where improvements have\r\nbeen taken place.\r\nThere is, however, no room for despair. Recent\r\nefforts of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity give much hope that the challenges facing\r\nthe continent can be successfully addressed. In\r\nparticular, the recently held United Nations Conference\r\non Financing for Development, which produced the\r\nMonterrey Consensus, is important in that it identified\r\nsources that can be used to finance the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Among such sources are the\r\nfollowing: The mobilization of domestic resources; the\r\nmobilization of external resources, including foreign\r\ndirect investment; increased financial and technical\r\ncooperation, and the resolution of the debt crisis. We\r\nwelcome the important step taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to initiate, within the United Nations, a\r\nMillennium campaign to place the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals on the top of the agenda for global\r\naction.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General gives\r\nprominence to the scourge of HIV/AIDS and other\r\ndiseases. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had very\r\nserious implications for economic and social progress\r\nin the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where\r\nthere is very little capacity to deal with the problem,\r\nowing mainly to limited resources at the disposal of\r\nthese countries. This necessarily requires more broad-\r\nbased global approaches.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report offers useful\r\ninsights on steps that can be taken to reverse the\r\nsituation, including addressing stigma and\r\ndiscrimination; prevention; mobilizing global response;\r\nexpanding access to care and treatment, and raising the\r\nrequired resources.\r\nDespite the involvement of the United Nations,\r\nthe donor community and other partners in providing\r\nresources for the fight against the pandemic, the\r\nresources are still inadequate to satisfactorily fund the\r\nresponse to HIV/AIDS. The challenge remains and\r\nrequires much more to be done if the goal of halting\r\nand reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and\r\nother major diseases by the year 2015 is to be\r\nachieved.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General deals as well\r\nwith issues of conflict prevention and peace, security\r\nand disarmament. These are also at the heart of the\r\nUnited Nations agenda.\r\nThe consequences of failure on the part of the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations to\r\nprevent conflict in various parts of the world have been\r\na loss of millions of lives, shattered economies and\r\ndisplacement of people. There is, therefore, a need to\r\nmake a concerted efforts to prevent conflicts from\r\nbreaking out in the first place. Such efforts should take\r\ncognizance of the fact that causes of conflict are\r\nmultidimensional. The Secretary-General’s report\r\noffers invaluable insights in this regard — that the\r\nresponsibility lies with national governments to adopt\r\nequitable public policies and to ensure adherence to\r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights standards,\r\nand for such efforts to be supported by the United\r\nNations, regional organizations, civil society and the\r\nprivate sector. We therefore look forward to the debate\r\non the agenda item entitled “Causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa”, where these issues will be\r\nexamined in greater detail.\r\nThe cooperation arrangements between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations need to be\r\nstrengthened, for they have the potential for effective\r\nprevention of conflict, covering all regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe world has not been spared from the scourge\r\nof terrorism. There is no alternative to forging strong\r\npartnerships in addressing that challenge. The events of\r\n11 September 2001, while indeed regrettable, have\r\ngiven a new impetus to the international community’s\r\ncommitment to deal with the problem. The work of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, established through\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), is worthy of\r\nthe support and cooperation of Member States. But it is\r\nalso important that the capacity problems faced by\r\nmost developing countries be addressed in order to\r\nenable them to implement all required measures, as\r\nstipulated in the resolution.\r\nWe look forward to the further strengthening of\r\nthe legal framework for the prevention and suppression\r\nof international terrorism by the United Nations,\r\nthrough the elaboration of a comprehensive and global\r\nconvention on terrorism. We stand ready to contribute\r\nto that process. It is also important that as many\r\nMember States as possible ratify all existing\r\nconventions on terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to add that the\r\ncontinent of Africa has recently taken a bold step to\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nensure that it is united in facing the enormous\r\nchallenges confronting it, through the establishment of\r\nthe African Union, which has initiated the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development. The continent is\r\ncommitted to creating an environment conducive to\r\neconomic growth and development. And the support\r\nand assistance of the international community, acting in\r\npartnership with Africa, is required for the initiative to\r\nsucceed.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): The report before us,\r\nwhich, under provisions of the Charter, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is expected to submit yearly to the General\r\nAssembly, is relatively short — definitely shorter than\r\nthat submitted last year — revealing, at first glance, the\r\ndetermination of the Secretary-General to cut down on\r\npaper use. We congratulate the Secretary-General on\r\nthe preparation of the report. It is precise, easily\r\nreadable and substantive.\r\nWe have noted the important changes that have\r\ntaken place since 1997 and the resultant adaptation of\r\nthe internal structure of the United Nations to the new\r\nchallenges. The Millennium Declaration of two years\r\nago, with its clear-cut priorities and time-bound goals,\r\nthe improvements in peacekeeping operations, the\r\npriorities set in combating and eradicating poverty and\r\nHIV/AIDS, and the fruitful partnerships are all\r\nevidence of a strong trend for a creative international\r\norganization worthy of the vision of its founding\r\nfathers and of the trust bestowed upon it by mankind.\r\nWe fully agree with the Secretary-General that\r\nthe need for a multilateral institution has never been\r\nmore acutely felt than it is today, and we pledge our\r\nunequivocal support for his efforts to strengthen the\r\nrole of the United Nations. Strengthening the United\r\nNations, the Organization entrusted with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, has\r\nbeen the cornerstone of our foreign policy. We\r\nearnestly believe that the Organization should have the\r\nnecessary means — both political and economic — so\r\nthat, as the Secretary-General said in a previous report,\r\nit will not let down those who trusted their fate to it.\r\nTherefore, it is high time that the collective system of\r\nsecurity, as provided for by the Charter of the United\r\nNations, be implemented and thus that the work of the\r\nfounding fathers be finally completed.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that there is\r\na need for even more changes, including in the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Department of Public\r\nInformation, and for the creation of an Office for the\r\nGlobal Compact as well as for the planning and\r\nservicing of meetings. Moreover, enhancing public\r\ninformation through special United Nations\r\nprogrammes and meaningful messages, referred to in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, will be especially useful\r\nin the task of strengthening the good relationship\r\nexisting among the United Nations, diplomatic\r\npersonnel and the citizens of our host city and country.\r\nThe general United Nations membership — especially\r\nthose associated with the Committee on Relations with\r\nthe Host Country — would fully agree on that need.\r\nThe United Nations, the report states, has a compelling\r\nstory to tell. We echo that statement and express the\r\nhope that it may have the desired impact in the world at\r\nlarge and in our beloved host city of New York.\r\nWe welcome the progress achieved in making the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council more\r\ntransparent, and we again express the hope that the\r\ndecade-old efforts of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nwith regard to enlarging the Security Council will be\r\nagreed upon. An enlarged Security Council would be\r\nmore democratic and thus more representative and\r\neffective. We agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nproliferation of meetings and of official documents and\r\nreports is a source of problems for the general United\r\nNations membership, especially the small delegations.\r\nCurtailment is therefore necessary with respect to\r\ndocumentation and meetings. We support the\r\nrationalization of the agenda of the General Assembly,\r\nprovided that the new agenda serves the interests and\r\nthe needs of the entire international community.\r\nWe also share the Secretary-General’s view that\r\nthe road to a better future is one of cooperation and\r\npartnership among States, as well as among the private\r\nand the civic sector, non-governmental organizations,\r\ninstitutions of learning and research, and others. The\r\nUnited Nations can guide those partnerships and unite\r\ntheir myriad efforts in pursuit of specific goals, such as\r\nthose contained clearly, and on the basis of priorities,\r\nin the historic Millennium Summit Declaration.\r\nCreating a partnership office to guide and channel all\r\nactivities within United Nations principles seems\r\nnecessary to us, especially since the implementation of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals has, as the\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nSecretary-General informed us, fallen short of\r\nexpectations.\r\nCorporations and the private sector in general\r\nhave much to contribute under the compact for\r\npartnership, and we welcome the appointment of an\r\nadviser in this domain.\r\nOf special concern is the Secretary-General’s\r\nassessment that on all of our broad objectives —\r\nhuman rights, democracy, good governance, the\r\nresolution of conflicts and the special needs of\r\nAfrica — we are moving too slowly. We owe it to\r\nourselves and to the credibility of the United Nations to\r\nmove faster in implementing the commitments we have\r\nundertaken in the Millennium Declaration related to\r\nthese most important objectives.\r\nFinally, we wish to stress also the need for more\r\nefficient human resources management and for\r\nflexibility in using budget resources for those priority\r\nissues among the goals of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): My delegation has considered with interest the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/57/1), as well as the report on the\r\nfollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\n(A/57/270).\r\nI should like at the outset to express our\r\nsatisfaction at the contents of the two reports in terms\r\nof information. They not only review the steps that the\r\nUnited Nations is taking to assist in resolving\r\ninternational problems and in promoting cooperation in\r\nall areas, but they also reflect, boldly and candidly, all\r\nof the successes and failures of the United Nations and\r\nof its missions, and discuss what needs to be done to\r\ndeal with grave international problems that require\r\nnecessary resources as well as cooperation among all\r\nStates.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization, the\r\nSecretary-General reviews cases that reflect positive\r\ndevelopments in the arena of international relations,\r\nparticularly in Asia and Africa, and the new\r\nmomentum produced by major international\r\nconferences. We share his view that peace and\r\ndevelopment are clear indicators of promising\r\nopportunities to consolidate security and stability in\r\nsome of the areas he mentioned and to bring about\r\npeace in other areas that are still suffering from conflict\r\nand turmoil.\r\nOne of the reasons for our satisfaction is that, in\r\ncases where success seems elusive, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has expressed his determination to exert\r\nutmost efforts to face international challenges in the\r\npolitical, economic and environmental areas. We hope\r\nthat he will work to resolve issues such as the increased\r\nlevel of poverty, the spread of disease, the deterioration\r\nof the environment and the decrease in growth rates,\r\nand that an end will be put to the Security Council’s\r\ninability to deal with certain grave problems, such as\r\nincreased tensions and conflicts and the continued\r\nusurpation and occupation of lands and the severe\r\npunishment of their inhabitants. The Secretary-General\r\nhas stated clearly that, instead of moving towards the\r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nthe world seems to be backsliding towards more\r\nconflicts.\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General speaks for\r\nall of us when he points out that terrorism threatens the\r\nprinciples contained in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. The international community must actively\r\naddress this problem and its causes by reviewing what\r\nthe United Nations has done in this area. Given the\r\nconclusions reached by international conferences, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the determination of the\r\nSecretary-General to see that the Organization plays an\r\neven more vital role in combating terrorism. In\r\nparticular, we would like to support his call on all\r\ncountries that have not done so to accede to all\r\nconventions aimed at fighting terrorism and\r\neliminating it. My country has acceded to all of the\r\ninternational and regional agreements in this area, and\r\nwe have presented our original report and our\r\ncomplementary reports, in accordance with the\r\nrequirements of the Committee established pursuant to\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nWe believe that putting an end to terrorism will\r\nrequire, first and foremost, uprooting it, and we must\r\nalso avoid the use of double standards in dealing with\r\nit. Terrorism will not be eradicated through lone efforts\r\nby individual States or a group of States. Indeed, the\r\nSecretary-General has stated that the United Nations is\r\nthe only forum that can give international legitimacy to\r\nthe struggle against terrorism.\r\nAlong these lines, we think that it is absolutely\r\nwrong to link terrorism to one culture, religion or\r\nethnicity, as some have done, and that it is\r\nunacceptable to describe as terrorism the struggle\r\nwaged by certain peoples in self-defence or for\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nindependence. The Organization must address these\r\nissues. We hope that we will arrive at an agreed text for\r\na comprehensive convention to suppress international\r\nterrorism. We also call for the holding of a special\r\nsession by the United Nations or an international\r\nconference devoted to the fight against terrorism that\r\nwould address all of the motives behind and causes of\r\nterrorism as well as the means of eradicating them. To\r\ndo so, we have to agree on a clear definition of\r\npolitically and internationally rejected terrorism and\r\ndelink it from legitimate struggles for independence\r\nand national liberation.\r\nDealing with the horrible phenomenon of\r\nterrorism should not distract us from the other issues\r\nmentioned by the Secretary-General in his report. We\r\nshare his concern that we have not achieved what had\r\nbeen expected in the area of disarmament, in particular\r\nwith respect to weapons of mass destruction. As long\r\nas these weapons exist, no one will have safety or\r\nsecurity. We welcome cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations as well as\r\nthe elaboration of joint strategies for the prevention\r\nand settlement of conflicts.\r\nWe look forward to progress in the reforms\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General to coordinate the\r\nwork of the Organization with that of other\r\ninternational bodies. We urge once again an equitable\r\ndistribution among the nationals of the States members\r\nof the United Nations, and we also welcome the efforts\r\nmade to bring about peace on the African continent, to\r\nconsolidate security in African countries and to direct\r\nefforts towards development and stability.\r\nWe welcome the fact, noted in the report, that\r\nmost African countries have registered impressive\r\ngrowth rates and recorded a decline in the rate of\r\nHIV/AIDS infection. Also important are the measures\r\ntaken by the Secretary-General to meet the needs of the\r\ncontinent in terms of bringing about the African\r\nUnion — something to which the continent had long\r\naspired — thereby enabling all African countries to\r\ncope with the challenges that the continent faces.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the pledges and\r\npromises made at the high-level meeting on the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). It is\r\nimportant that all concerned partners cooperate with\r\nthe African Union to achieve the objectives set out by\r\nNEPAD, which is led, owned and managed by the\r\nAfrican Union; that they support all efforts to ease\r\ntensions and to work to eradicate hunger, poverty and\r\ndisease; and that they help put an end to the draining\r\nby colonialist Powers of the wealth of the continent.\r\nThe issue of sanctions also is among those\r\nconsidered by the Secretary-General in his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization. He underlines, among\r\nother things, that targeted sanctions can contribute to a\r\ngeneral strategy of preventive diplomacy. This is true if\r\nall the provisions of the Charter are taken into account.\r\nHowever, sanctions should not be resorted to before\r\npeaceful means have been explored, nor should they be\r\nused as a punishment, as happened to my country, on\r\nwhich sanctions were imposed without any evidence of\r\nguilt — sanctions that the Security Council is\r\nprevented from lifting because one country will not\r\nallow it for political reasons.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s call for the\r\nreform of the Security Council, not only to expand its\r\nmembership but also radically to reform its methods of\r\nwork, so as to enhance its credibility in fulfilling its\r\nresponsibility to maintain international peace and\r\nsecurity, as entrusted to it by the Charter, and to ensure\r\nthat it is not used as a means for the powerful to\r\nachieve their political objectives.\r\nMr. Traoré (Guinea) (spoke in French): On\r\nbehalf of my delegation, I should like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his reports on the work of the\r\nOrganization and on the follow-up to the outcome of\r\nthe Millennium Summit. May I also congratulate him\r\non the quality of these two important documents. I will\r\nfocus here on the first report.\r\nAs in previous years, the question of international\r\npeace and security has occupied a pivotal place in the\r\nactivities of the Organization. As the Secretary-General\r\npoints out, some conflicts have seen some progress,\r\nwhereas others, unfortunately, continue to give rise to\r\nconcern. My delegation welcomes the laudable efforts\r\nthat have been made by the United Nations to reduce\r\ntension in a number of hot spots around the world,\r\ngiving rise to some notable breakthroughs during the\r\ncourse of the year 2002 in the settlement and\r\nmanagement of crises, for example, in Afghanistan,\r\nTimor-Leste, and to a certain extent, in Sierra Leone.\r\nIt is my country’s hope that the prospects for\r\npeace that have emerged recently in countries long\r\nbeset by conflict can strengthen and lead to final and\r\nlasting resolution, be it in Angola, Ethiopia and Eritrea,\r\nSudan or the Great Lakes region. However, it should be\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nemphasized that our Organization should stay with\r\nthose countries as the peace is consolidated, which\r\nrequires a global and integrated approach to the peace\r\nprocess with simultaneous action on several fronts —\r\npolitical, military, humanitarian and economic.\r\nWhile we can be pleased at the positive results\r\nachieved in settling crises and peace-building, it\r\nremains true, nevertheless, that a number of challenges\r\nstill need to be met. This is, unfortunately, the case in\r\nthe Middle East, Liberia, Western Sahara, Somalia and\r\nIraq.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation believes that the\r\nsignificant achievements in conflict management have\r\nresulted, to a large extent, from the improvements\r\nmade in the capacity for rapid deployment, training,\r\nand integrated planning for peacekeeping operations.\r\nWe urge continued effective implementation of the\r\nrecommendations of the Panel on United Nations Peace\r\nOperations. We echo the concerns expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General regarding the shortage of personnel\r\nin peacekeeping operations. In this connection, we urge\r\nthe troop-contributing countries to continue their\r\nefforts so that the effectiveness of these missions will\r\nnot be compromised.\r\nThe serious humanitarian consequences that have\r\nstemmed from armed conflicts and natural disasters,\r\nsuch as those discussed in the report, should receive\r\nmore of our attention. The breadth and the range of\r\nhumanitarian problems make it imperative that\r\navailable means be augmented in order to ensure that\r\nappropriate emergency aid is forthcoming. The\r\nprotection of civilians, which is at the heart of the\r\naction taken in complex emergency situations, is\r\ncurrently encountering great difficulties, including\r\naccess to displaced persons, failure to respect\r\nfundamental humanitarian principles and rights, and\r\ninadequacy of financial resources.\r\nIn the light of the fifty million civilian persons\r\ndisplaced throughout the world as a result of conflicts\r\nor natural disasters, my delegation favours that policies\r\nand mechanisms be adopted at the level of the United\r\nNations. We particularly welcome the specific support\r\ngiven by the inter-agency Unit on Internal\r\nDisplacement, which was set up in January 2002 and\r\nhas helped a number of countries, including my own,\r\nas part of its humanitarian operations. We believe that\r\nsending this kind of inter-disciplinary missions to\r\nunstable areas should be encouraged and supported.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation would like to support\r\nthe appeal by the Secretary-General to mobilize\r\nadequate resources for emergency actions. We welcome\r\nthe appointment of an independent Security\r\nCoordinator at the rank of Assistant-Secretary-General.\r\nWe are also grateful for the welcome initiatives that\r\nhave led to the creation of sound partnerships with\r\nother international agencies, Governments and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nAnother challenge that needs to be met, and not\r\nthe least, is the eradication of poverty, which often is\r\nthe root cause of instability. We believe, in this\r\nconnection, that the attention given by our\r\nOrganization to settling crises throughout the world\r\nshould go hand in hand with efforts to combat poverty\r\nin accordance with the historic Millennium Summit\r\nDeclaration. Important conferences that have been held\r\nover the last twelve months are a part of this ongoing\r\neffort. But more than ever, it is essential that the\r\ncommitments entered into at these meetings be\r\nhonoured so as to produce concrete solutions to\r\ndevelopment problems, particularly in Africa.\r\nIn that same vein, my delegation once again\r\nmakes an earnest appeal for the international\r\ncommunity to mobilize and provide support for the\r\nNew Partnership for the Development of Africa\r\n(NEPAD).\r\nIn conclusion, Sir, my delegation would like to\r\nreiterate its support to the Secretary-General and\r\nextends every good wish for success in the various\r\nactions he has initiated to the service of the community\r\nof nations.\r\nMs. Pérez Contreras (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): My delegation has read with interest the first\r\nreport on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm the commitment of the Government of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the goals set forth\r\nin that Declaration, adopted by the heads of States and\r\nGovernments of the whole world in September 2000.\r\nIn that Declaration, world leaders underscored\r\ncommon values, such as freedom, equality, solidarity,\r\ntolerance, respect for nature and common\r\nresponsibility. On that basis, they expressed their\r\nintention to carry out concerted action on the\r\ninternational agenda of the twenty-first century,\r\nparticularly in areas relating to international peace and\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nsecurity, and the economic and social development of\r\nour peoples.\r\nThe target date of 2015 was set to achieve most\r\nof the Goals, including the eradication of poverty and\r\nhunger, the reduction of infant mortality and\r\nmalnutrition, combating diseases, such as HIV/AIDS\r\nand malaria, ensuring environmental sustainability and\r\ndeveloping a global partnership for development.\r\nMy delegation believes that the General\r\nAssembly has the requisite structure to monitor\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nand that there is no need to create new bodies for this\r\npurpose. However, there is a need for enhanced\r\ncoordination among the principal organs of the United\r\nNations and agencies in the system. The guide for the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration, a\r\ndocument presented by Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nin document A/57/387, represents the main\r\nmethodological framework for such coordination.\r\nVenezuela attaches the greatest of importance to\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nbelieves in the need to forge an international\r\nenvironment in which South-South cooperation will be\r\na crucial instrument. Re-starting the North-South\r\ndialogue will also be an urgent need, and the United\r\nNations will be a fundamental component of this.\r\nWe believe that the aspirations of the Millennium\r\nSummit need to be seen together with the commitments\r\nundertaken at the Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nConferences. Achieving the objectives and goals\r\nwhich, together, target development and well-being for\r\nour nations will mean an endeavour of tremendous\r\nmagnitude, involving everyone’s pooled efforts to\r\ndevise strategic partnerships at the multilateral level,\r\namong States, the Bretton Woods institutions, the\r\nWorld Trade Organization and other international\r\nagencies, as well as at the domestic level in all\r\ncountries.\r\nHence, the importance of the Monterrey\r\nconsensus, which is the outcome of decades of\r\ninsistence on the part of the developing countries to try\r\nto combine the efforts of the Bretton Woods institutions\r\nand those of the United Nations. These efforts, in turn,\r\nhave to go hand in hand with the resolve to liberalize\r\ntrade and access to markets, expressed at Doha, with a\r\nview to fostering a more integrated trading system.\r\nLikewise, the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation reaffirms the international\r\ncommunity’s commitment to achieve the complete\r\nimplementation of Agenda 21. The three-fold structure\r\nthus created highlights and reiterates the permanent\r\nneed for strengthening international cooperation. We\r\nreaffirm the proposal of our President, Hugo Chávez\r\nFrías, to set up an international humanitarian fund,\r\nusing a portion of the resources released by reduced\r\nmilitary expenditure, among other things.\r\nThe priority given to Africa in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration met with a satisfactory response this year.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reaffirm its recognition of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\ninitiative, which proposes new forms of cooperation\r\nand a dovetailing of interests between Africa and the\r\ndeveloped world. We are certain that its success will\r\nopen new avenues, not only for South-South\r\ncooperation, but also in the North-South context.\r\nMy delegation views with satisfaction the report\r\nof the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization and the plans designed to adapt this work\r\nto the priorities and postulates of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Venezuela believes that the United\r\nNations must play a decisive and irreplaceable role in\r\nfinding solutions to world economic problems, in\r\nfostering development and international cooperation,\r\nand in leading the struggle against international\r\nterrorism, while at the same time paying attention to\r\nother no less important political commitments that\r\naffect our nations, such as securing peace, security and\r\ninternational disarmament, bolstering democracy and\r\ngovernance in nations, strengthening national human\r\nrights institutions and providing electoral assistance in\r\nassisting the development of new and restored\r\ndemocracies.\r\nVenezuela is in favour of strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations, given our conviction that\r\nmultilateralism should be an effective instrument with\r\nwhich to forge common positions and resolve\r\ndifferences. Reform means revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly, restructuring the Security Council and\r\nmaking it more democratic; and bolstering the United\r\nNations as a whole.\r\nThe course mapped out at the Millennium\r\nSummit, together with the Doha, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg Conferences as major milestones, should\r\nenable us to achieve the Millennium Development\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nGoals. But this will be true only if we can achieve a\r\nstrategic partnership, sustained by genuine political\r\nresolve, among all the world’s leaders who will act\r\nwith decisiveness and commitment to their own\r\nnations.\r\nMr. Aboulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nbehalf of the State of Kuwait, allow me, Sir, to express\r\nour deep appreciation for all the efforts undertaken by\r\nthe Secretary-General in leading our Organization, as\r\nreflected in the various reports under discussion at this\r\nfifty-seventh session. In particular, I wish to mention\r\nhis annual report on the work of the Organization. All\r\nof this shows how seriously he is taking his mandate\r\nand how he carries it out in the best possible way. I\r\nwould also like to thank him for the statement he made\r\nin the General Assembly when we first started\r\ndiscussing this agenda item, at which time he stressed\r\nthe importance of implementing the Declaration of the\r\nMillennium so that it would not become a mere\r\nmemory. That could undermine the prestige held for\r\nour Organization in the eyes of our peoples, who are\r\nlooking forward to seeing the United Nations play a\r\ngreater role in the new millennium.\r\nBefore expressing our comments and opinions on\r\nthe substantive issues contained in the two reports of\r\nthe Secretary-General concerning the work of the\r\nOrganization and the follow-up to the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, we would like to pay tribute\r\nto the measure adopted by the General Assembly in\r\nmerging the discussion of the two items. We see this as\r\na contribution to efforts made towards rationalization\r\nof the work of the General Assembly and\r\nreinforcement of its role.\r\nYet, at the same time, my delegation feels that\r\nrationalization and reform have not been fully covered\r\nwhen discussing these two items. Although we merged\r\nthe discussion of the two items, we did not fully benefit\r\nfrom the rationalization, because it did not reduce the\r\nnumber of reports submitted, particularly since one of\r\nthe proposals for rationalization and reform in the\r\nSecretary-General’s most recent report calls for\r\nreducing the number of reports submitted in order to\r\navoid repetition of these items.\r\nAfter having studied the two reports dealing with\r\nagenda items 10 and 44, my delegation noted\r\nsimilarities in both the topics covered and the way in\r\nwhich they were dealt with. We would have hoped to\r\nsee the Secretariat seize the opportunity — all States\r\nhaving agreed on the need to rationalize — to submit\r\none single report that would cover both items: the\r\nSecretary-General’s annual report on the work of the\r\nOrganization and the follow-up to the outcome of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, while mentioning that the one\r\nreport would be covering both agenda items, 10 and 44.\r\nAlthough we realize that General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/95, adopted at the last session, asks the\r\nSecretary-General to submit a separate special report\r\non the follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, we would have hoped that the Secretariat,\r\nnoting the similarity of the topics covered by the two\r\nreports, would have submitted one single report,\r\nincluding the two items, just as the Secretariat did in\r\ndeciding to merge the discussion of the two reports.\r\nFurthermore, such action would have been taken\r\nin implementation of that resolution, which called for a\r\nseparate report on the Millennium Declaration.\r\nMy delegation believes that no one would object\r\nto such a positive approach. Indeed, we all are grateful\r\nfor it because it will reduce the burden of work on both\r\nthe Member States and the Secretariat. We also fear\r\nthat, given that so many proposals and ideas are\r\ncontained in the enormous number of important reports\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General, they will not elicit\r\nenough interest of Member States. We should recall\r\nthat we have before us three important reports of the\r\nSecretary-General that we are called upon to examine:\r\nthe report on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration; the report on the reform of the\r\nOrganization, under agenda item 53; and the annual\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nOur delegation would like to make a number of\r\ncomments on the annual report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the Organization, as well as on\r\nhis report on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. First, our delegation supports all the\r\ncomments made by the Secretary-General on\r\n10 September, when he introduced his annual report\r\nbefore the beginning of the general debate, concerning\r\nthe pivotal role of the United Nations in the area of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in\r\naccordance with the principles of the Charter.\r\nHow do we reconcile those principles with some\r\nof the thorny issues raised by the Secretary-General,\r\nfor example those relating to the principle of\r\nhumanitarian intervention and the role of the United\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nNations in this respect, as well as in guaranteeing\r\nrespect for the sovereignty of all States. Despite having\r\nasked that rhetorical question, we would again like to\r\nsay that we fully agree with the pessimistic views\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General in his report\r\nconcerning the deterioration of certain conflict\r\nsituations and other regrettable events that we have\r\nwitnessed recently, in particular the terrorist attacks\r\nagainst the United States and the savagery perpetrated\r\nagainst the Palestinian people.\r\nSecondly, our delegation supports the views\r\nexpressed in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization\r\nwith regard to the situation between Iraq and Kuwait,\r\nin particular the issue of prisoners of war and Kuwaiti\r\nproperty. We agree with both the substance and the\r\ncontent of these paragraphs. Our position concerning\r\nthose two issues was very clearly expressed in the\r\naddress given by our Deputy Prime Minister in the\r\ngeneral debate. Nevertheless, we find it difficult to\r\nunderstand why the Secretariat insists on using the\r\nterm “missing persons” when referring to Kuwaiti\r\nprisoners of war. The Secretary-General and the\r\nDepartment of Political Affairs believe that they, as\r\nneutral parties, should use the language of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, in particular resolutions 686\r\n(1991), 687 (1991) and 1284 (1999), which use the\r\nterm “Kuwaiti and third country nationals” —\r\nterminology with which we fully agree. Indeed, the\r\nSecretary-General used those terms in his annual report\r\nlast year and in his report submitted to the Security\r\nCouncil pursuant to paragraph 14 of resolution 1284\r\n(1999). We hope that that practice will be followed in\r\nthe future.\r\nThirdly, our delegation notes for the second time\r\nthat in the section on peacekeeping operations, the\r\nreport does not refer to the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\r\nObservation Mission (UNIKOM), which is based on\r\nthe border between Iraq and Kuwait, or to any positive\r\nor negative developments in the situation there. It\r\nshould be noted that Kuwait is voluntarily contributing\r\ntwo thirds of the budget of that force because of its\r\nsteadfast belief in the vital importance of the United\r\nNations presence in that region.\r\nFourthly, with regard to the administration of the\r\nOrganization, Kuwait would like to pay tribute to the\r\nmeasures adopted by the Secretary-General recently to\r\nreinforce the role played by the United Nations in\r\ndisseminating information on the culture of the United\r\nNations among the States and peoples of the world\r\nthrough improved press and television coverage and\r\nthe impressive services provided by the United Nations\r\nweb site. In this respect, I would like to say that we\r\nlook forward to the further strengthening of the\r\ncapacities of the Arab section in the Department of\r\nPublic Information, as it offers excellent services to\r\nresearchers and specialists working with issues related\r\nto the United Nations in all the Arab States.\r\nBecause of its firm belief in the role of the United\r\nNations in disseminating information, Kuwait was\r\namong the first States to support the partnership\r\nprogramme between the communications media and the\r\nUnited Nations to enable it to reach out to journalists\r\nall over the world. Here I refer to our firm support for\r\nthe training programme for journalists and network\r\ncorrespondents in developing countries.\r\nFifthly, I would like to say that my country will\r\ncomment on and provide an in-depth analysis of the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General in the area of\r\nreforming and strengthening the Organization when we\r\ndiscuss the most recent report of the Secretary-General\r\non the reform of the Organization under agenda item\r\n53, entitled “Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nsystem”.\r\nKuwait hopes that that subject will not be\r\ndiscussed in such a way as to overburden\r\ndelegations — particularly the smaller ones — and\r\neffectively reduce them to the status of observers in a\r\ndebate that is monopolized by certain delegations. We\r\nalso hope that when we discuss those proposals we will\r\nnot do so in haste, resulting in the adoption of\r\ndecisions whose implications have been fully\r\nunderstood only by a very small number of delegations.\r\nMs. Raholinirina (Madagascar) (spoke in\r\nFrench): My delegation wishes, at the outset, to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration adopted\r\ntwo years ago by the leaders of the world, which\r\nappears in document A/57/270. That report provides us\r\nwith an objective assessment of the implementation of\r\ncommitments aimed at consolidating peace,\r\ndevelopment, combating infectious diseases, protecting\r\nthe environment, respect for human rights and good\r\ngovernance, assistance to Africa and strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to pay tribute to the\r\ninitiatives of our Secretary-General, particularly those\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nenvisaged within the framework of the Millennium\r\nproject designed to promote achievement of the goals\r\ncontained in that historic document.\r\nWhen it adopted the Millennium Declaration, the\r\ninternational community acknowledged the collective\r\nresponsibility of all its members to build a more just,\r\nprosperous and peaceful world. Achieving the\r\nobjectives contained in the Declaration and supported\r\nby the campaign pan, will require a clear understanding\r\nby all States of their interdependence and their\r\ncommon destiny. Those objectives are the same as\r\nthose that have been spelled out in the various world\r\nconferences held in the 1990s that were aimed mainly\r\nat combating poverty, conflict prevention and\r\nprotecting the environment. The scant progress\r\nachieved in those areas prompts us to move from\r\ncommitment to implementation.\r\nWhile paying tribute to efforts of the United\r\nNations to further peace throughout the world, my\r\ndelegation believes that much remains to be done to\r\ninstil a culture of peace on our planet. In that context,\r\nMadagascar fully shares the view that, generally\r\nspeaking, it is more humane and less costly to prevent\r\na conflict than to have to manage its tragic\r\nconsequences once it has erupted.\r\nWhile it is true that the political will of\r\nGovernments concerned is necessary to prevent\r\nconflict, at the same time, we must not lose sight of the\r\ninternational community’s responsibility to create a\r\nglobal environment that is more just and that would\r\nreduce inequalities between States and within States\r\nthat engender conflicts and political upheaval. In that\r\nconnection, the point made by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report is a matter of considerable concern. The\r\nreport says:\r\n“We confront a world divided between rich and\r\npoor as never before in human history…\r\n“The prospects for meeting the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals given current trends, are\r\ndecidedly mixed, with marked differences\r\nbetween and within regions”. (A/57/270,\r\npara. 38-39)\r\nReducing the number of people living in extreme\r\npoverty between now and 2015 seems to be a remote\r\ntarget for many regions of the world, particularly for\r\nAfrica, where most of the least developed countries\r\nare.\r\nThe report on least developed countries published\r\nthis year by the United Nations Conference on Trade\r\nand Development (UNCTAD) anticipates that the\r\nnumber of people living in extreme poverty will\r\nincrease from 113 million in the least developed\r\ncountries between now and 2015, if current trends\r\ncontinue. Far from improving, those trends may well\r\ngrow worse because of the impact of the terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September, which will mean that even\r\nmore millions of people will be victimized by poverty.\r\nThat gloomy picture is supplemented by an increase in\r\narms expenditure, which diminishes any hope that the\r\npeace dividend will be allocated to development.\r\nNevertheless, according to the most recent report\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) on human development, all the Millennium\r\nDeclaration objectives could be achieved if official\r\ndevelopment assistance were to be supplemented by at\r\nleast a fraction of current military expenses.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration, unanimously\r\nadopted by the leaders of the industrialized countries,\r\npresupposes that they are unanimously committed to\r\ndemonstrating solidarity with the developing countries\r\nand that it is in their interest to help those countries\r\nbecome fully integrated into the world economy.\r\nFurthermore, that idea is implicitly recognized in the\r\nresolutions of the Fourth World Trade Organization\r\nMinisterial Conference, held in Doha in November\r\n2001, and explicitly in the Monterrey Consensus, as\r\nwell as in the course of World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, recently held in Johannesburg.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration goals are neither\r\nutopian nor overly ambitious, provided that we are\r\nfirmly resolved to see them through. Achieving those\r\nobjectives will require our determination to work\r\ntogether for a more equitable economy, in which all\r\ncountries can enjoy conditions of fair competition and\r\nthe “haves” will do more for the “have nots”. Without\r\nthe mobilization of the necessary financial resources\r\nand the appropriate economic conditions, both\r\nnationally and internationally, “the ringing words of the\r\nDeclaration will serve only as grim reminders of\r\nhuman needs neglected and promises unmet”, as the\r\nSecretary-General said so aptly in his report.\r\nIf, in one way or another, States find the $800\r\nbillion for their annual armaments expenditures, surely\r\nthey can contribute at least a small part of that to\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\npolicies designed to prevent war and tackle poverty,\r\none of the underlying causes of conflicts.\r\nAs the continent most affected by poverty and\r\nother scourges, including the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\r\nAfrica needs more than ever international support and\r\nsolidarity to rescue it from abject poverty. Africa’s\r\nefforts to take charge of itself and to attain self-\r\nsufficiency, reflected within the framework of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),\r\ndeserve to be acknowledged and supported by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nConstituting an enormous reservoir of dynamism\r\nand potential, the developing countries prefer trade to\r\naid and solidarity to charity, so that the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of all States, as envisaged by the Charter,\r\nbecomes a reality, rather than a mere pious wish.\r\nDespite the numerous challenges that await us in\r\nachieving the Millennium Declaration Goals,\r\nMadagascar is convinced that, given political will and\r\nadequate resources, a coordinated strategy and\r\nappropriate cooperation at all levels, the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration goals\r\nwill yield better results.\r\nIn synergy with the international community,\r\nMadagascar is ready to cooperate with all the\r\ncomponents of the United Nations family to offer\r\nmankind a more dignified and safer world that is free\r\nof fear and need.\r\nMr. Al-Taieeb (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nI wish, at the outset, to join my colleagues in\r\nexpressing appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on the work of the Organization during the\r\npast year.\r\nI must praise the great effort made in producing\r\nthis report, which is indeed comprehensive and\r\naccurate, dealing with developments witnessed last\r\nyear by the international community. Also\r\npraiseworthy is the role of the Organization for its\r\nhandling of the issues of security and peace, as well as\r\neconomic, social and developmental issues. I would\r\nlike to pay tribute in particular to the realism of the\r\nreport when it alludes to the fears of many people that\r\nthe world this year has become a more dangerous place\r\nthan it was years ago.\r\nObservers of the international situation perceive\r\nthat the main reason for the decline in the feelings of\r\nsecurity for many people is due to the fact that many\r\ncountries have given up on their commitment to the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter,\r\nand are not respecting the norms of international law.\r\nThis is in addition to the fact that the international\r\ncommunity has not stood up decisively and forcefully\r\nto those who lurk outside international legality. Thus\r\ninjustice, oppression and violence have prevailed and,\r\nconsequently, people have lost their security and peace\r\nof mind.\r\nThe inhuman practices occurring in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories, including killings,\r\nassassinations, demolitions of houses and repeated\r\nsiege conditions imposed by the Israeli occupying\r\nforces against unarmed Palestinian people and their\r\nlegitimate leadership, is an embodiment of the policy\r\nof injustice and State terrorism and an example of\r\ndisrespect for the principles of the United Nations and\r\ninternational law.\r\nIsrael has previously refused to implement all the\r\nresolutions of the United Nations that are relevant to its\r\noccupation of Palestine and other Arab territories,\r\nincluding resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 194\r\n(1948). It refused this year to receive the fact-finding\r\nmission constituted by the Secretary-General, at the\r\nbehest of the Security Council, in its unanimously\r\nadopted resolution 1405 (2002), in order to investigate\r\nthe horrors perpetrated by the Israeli occupying force\r\nin Jenin. This led the Secretary-General to dissolve the\r\nfact-finding team before it could visit the area.\r\nIsrael again has rejected the implementation of\r\nCouncil resolution 1435 (2002), which calls for an\r\nimmediate withdrawal of the Israeli occupying forces\r\nfrom the Palestinian towns to the areas where they\r\nwere before September 2000. This Israeli position,\r\nwhich rejects the implementation of all international\r\nresolutions relevant to its occupation of Palestinian\r\nterritories and other Arab territories, on the one hand,\r\nand the fact that the international community has not\r\nforced Israel to implement these resolutions, on the\r\nother, cause the Palestinian people, suffering from the\r\nhorrors of Israeli occupation, to continue to feel\r\ninsecure and to live in fear and horror.\r\nThe feeling of security is declining in the world\r\nbecause of the growth of terrorism, a phenomenon\r\nwhich my country had warned against, calling many\r\ntimes for intensifying international efforts to combat it.\r\nSaudi Arabia was one of the first countries to ratify the\r\nArab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.24\r\nthe Islamic Convention on Combatting International\r\nTerrorism. On the international level, my country has\r\nacceded to many international conventions and\r\nagreements to combat terrorism. Therefore, it was only\r\nnatural that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was among\r\nthe first States that have strongly condemned the\r\nterrorist attacks on the United States last year,\r\nconsidering these attacks as a criminal act that fully\r\ncontradicts religious teachings and all values of\r\nhumanity and civilization.\r\nIn the context of combating terrorism, Saudi\r\nArabia cooperates with all parties, whether bilaterally\r\nor multilaterally, in accordance with Security Council\r\nresolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001).\r\nIt is regrettable and worrisome, however, that the\r\nterrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September in the\r\nUnited States have generated a phenomenon no less\r\ndangerous than terrorism itself. If it continued, it would\r\nbecome the main nutrient for terrorism in the future.\r\nThis is the phenomenon of spreading hostility and\r\nhatred against Arabs and Moslems.\r\nSome evil circles, in some countries, have\r\nunderstood these terrorist attacks outside of their true\r\nand real meaning. They have waged a hostile campaign\r\nagainst Arabs and Moslems in an attempt to accuse\r\nthem of terrorism. There is not enough time here to\r\ndeal with such a hostile campaign and to put an end to\r\nit. However, everybody knows that Islam, as other\r\nrevealed religions, prohibits killing a person without\r\njustification and punishes very severely anybody who\r\ncommits murder. Islam is a revealed religion that calls\r\nfor justice, equality and peace, a religion that\r\ncondemns violence.\r\nFurthermore, it is not possible that a whole\r\nnation, which constitutes nearly one-fifth of the\r\nworld’s population, could be accused of terrorism just\r\nbecause some individuals belonging to it have\r\nparticipated in such a crime. It was never the case\r\nbefore that all Jews and Christians were accused of the\r\nsins perpetrated by some members of their religion.\r\nWhy then is this principle applied to Arabs and\r\nMoslems?\r\nWhile we condemn this dangerous trend, and we\r\nwarn against such a phenomenon that could cause\r\nhatred between different populations, we call upon this\r\nOrganization to do all it can to confront this\r\nphenomenon which is based on racism and xenophobia,\r\nto promote the culture of peace and dialogue between\r\ncultures, and to deepen the values of forgiveness,\r\njustice and equality between nations and peoples, so\r\nthat peace and security prevail all over the world.\r\nThe issue of disarmament is one of the highest\r\npriorities for my country. It is thus regrettable to see,\r\nthrough reading the Secretary-General’s report for this\r\nyear, that the multilateral forums for disarmament have\r\nnot witnessed any international cooperation during the\r\npast year. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia supports all\r\ninternational efforts aimed at general and complete\r\ndisarmament, particularly weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has acceded to the\r\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to the\r\nInternational Convention for the Prohibition of\r\nBiological and Chemical Weapons.\r\nMy country participates also in the international\r\nand regional efforts to make the Middle East a zone\r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction. In this respect, we\r\nshould note that, despite the fact that the United\r\nNations General Assembly issues annually, since 1974,\r\na resolution calling for making the Middle East a zone\r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction, this objective has\r\nnot been achieved because of the rejection by one\r\ncountry in the region, Israel. It refuses to join the\r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to submit its\r\nnuclear programmes to full scope safeguards under the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency’s supervision.\r\nTherefore, my country calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to take all necessary measures to ensure\r\nthat the Middle East is free of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, a matter which will contribute largely to\r\nbring about security and stability in the region and the\r\nworld as a whole.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress the great\r\nimportance that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia accords\r\nthe United Nations and its primary role in maintaining\r\ninternational peace, security and stability and in\r\nfostering development and prosperity so that the world\r\nwill become a secure place for everyone. That, in our\r\nview, is based on respect for the principles and goals of\r\nthe United Nations in the implementation of\r\ninternational legitimacy.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on these items in this meeting. We shall\r\ncontinue the debate this afternoon at 3 p.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
