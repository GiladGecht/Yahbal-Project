"United Nations A/57/PV.27\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nFifty-seventh session\r\n27th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 14 October 2002, 10.00 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n02-63581 (E)\r\n*0263581*\r\nPresident: Mr. Kavan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Ms. Clarke\r\n(Barbados), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 117 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/57/440/Add.2)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nattention of the General Assembly to document\r\nA/57/440/Add.2. In the letter contained in that\r\ndocument, the Secretary-General informs the President\r\nof the General Assembly that since the issuance of his\r\ncommunications contained in documents A/57/440 and\r\nA/57/440/Add.1, Kyrgyzstan has made the necessary\r\npayment to reduce its arrears below the amount\r\nspecified in article 19 of the Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of the information contained in that\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 7\r\nNotification by the Secretary-General under Article\r\n12, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/57/392)\r\nThe Acting President: As members are aware, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 12,\r\nparagraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations and\r\nwith the consent of the Security Council, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is mandated to notify the General Assembly of\r\nmatters relative to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security that are being dealt with by the\r\nSecurity Council and of matters with which the Council\r\nhas ceased to deal.\r\nIn that connection, the General Assembly has\r\nbefore it a note by the Secretary-General issued as\r\ndocument A/57/392.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of that\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 40\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/57/2 and Corr.1)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and related matters: Report of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Mr. Martin Belinga-\r\nEboutou of Cameroon, to introduce the report of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): I have the privilege, in my capacity as\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of\r\nOctober 2002, to introduce the annual report\r\n(A/57/Corr.1) of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nAt this stage, I should like, on behalf of the\r\nCouncil, to express my congratulations to you, Mr. Jan\r\nKavan, on his election as President of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I have no doubt that,\r\nduring his mandate, the relations between our two\r\norgans will be further strengthened to encourage\r\noptimal promotion of the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter. We are also aware that, since Mr. Kavan\r\nassumed office, he has engaged Council members in a\r\nconstructive and encouraging dialogue with a particular\r\nview to increasing the fluidity of exchanges between\r\nthe two organs.\r\nThe report under consideration covers the period\r\nfrom 16 June 2001 to 31 July 2002. I should like to\r\ndraw members’ attention to the note by the President of\r\nthe Security Council dated 22 May 2002, published as\r\ndocument S/2002/199. That document sets out the\r\nchanges introduced to the format of the Council’s\r\nreport and the improvements made to it. I shall return\r\nto this later.\r\nAs members will have noted, the Security\r\nCouncil was very active between June 2001 and July\r\n2002. It was able to consider in detail some issues that\r\nhave been on its agenda for many years, and in some\r\ncases it was able to sharply reduce difficulties related\r\nto those items. Thanks to the determination and\r\nimagination of Council members, other, more recent,\r\nissues have been dealt with appropriately, with\r\nconvincing results. Thus, specifically with respect to\r\nAfrica, the Security Council, with its characteristic\r\nseriousness, has addressed the crisis situations in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, in Burundi, in Somalia, in Western Sahara, in\r\nLiberia, in Sierra Leone, in Guinea-Bissau and in the\r\nCentral African Republic. I should like to emphasize\r\nand to welcome the fact that some of those crises are\r\non the way to being resolved.\r\nStates member of the Assembly are aware that the\r\nCouncil has created its own Ad Hoc Working Group on\r\nConflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa. That\r\nWorking Group, which is chaired by Ambassador\r\nJagdish Koonjul of Mauritius, to whom I should like to\r\npay tribute, has done remarkable work in the few\r\nmonths of its existence.\r\nAlso, with regard to the African part of the work\r\nof the Security Council, I should like to emphasize two\r\nsteps that have had a significant impact on the way the\r\nCouncil addresses African issues, whether they relate\r\nto conflict management or to post-crisis situations. The\r\nCouncil’s mission in May 2002 to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and to other countries of the\r\nregion gave it first-hand experience of the reality on\r\nthe ground. Likewise, the workshop organized in July\r\n2002 on the situation in the Mano River Union\r\ncountries helped us to understand better the\r\ncomplexities and implications underlying certain\r\nconflicts in West Africa.\r\nOther important matters before the Council are\r\nbeing addressed assiduously and with a commitment to\r\nprogress: the Balkans, Cyprus, Iraq and the Middle\r\nEast. Some of these have seen developments that have\r\nbeen welcomed by the entire United Nations\r\ncommunity, in particular, Timor-Leste and\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nAs members are aware, the Security Council, in\r\nits work, goes well beyond the strictly conflictual\r\naspects of the crises of which it is seized; when\r\nnecessary, it also deals with them in a cross-cutting\r\nmanner from a thematic perspective, as in the case of\r\nwomen or children in armed conflict, the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict, and peacekeeping\r\noperations. Furthermore, on 14 February 2002, the\r\nCouncil agreed on a new mechanism aimed at\r\nimproving cooperation with troop-contributing\r\ncountries. It also adopted by consensus, after difficult\r\nnegotiations, resolution 1422 (2002), concerning\r\nmatters including the legal situation of peacekeeping\r\ncontingents.\r\nAnother threat to international peace and security\r\nthat has mobilized the Security Council is terrorism.\r\nFaced with that scourge, the Council undertook to go\r\nbeyond its specific areas of work and decided to take\r\nthe bull by the horns. It set up a Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, which has become authoritative thanks to\r\nthe dynamism of its Chairman, Ambassador Jeremy\r\nGreenstock, and to the fortunate involvement of all\r\nStates members of the Organization.\r\nThe Council devotes much time to following up\r\non the implementation of sanctions that it is obliged to\r\nimpose on certain States. At the same time, it has\r\ncontinued to consider — under my presidency and after\r\nthe excellent work done earlier by Bangladesh — the\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nbest possible way to improve the effectiveness of\r\nsanctions and to minimize their adverse consequences\r\non civilian populations or on third States. That very\r\ndelicate exercise also leads us to evaluate the\r\nmechanisms for imposing, suspending and lifting\r\nsanctions.\r\nAll the issues that I have mentioned are merely a\r\nglimpse of the colossal amount of work done by the\r\nSecurity Council during the period under consideration.\r\nI should also like to stress the approach that the\r\nCouncil has chosen to renew its relations with non-\r\nStates members not of the Council and with\r\ninternational public opinion.\r\nIt will be recalled that, during the debate on this\r\nagenda item during the fifty-sixth session, Assembly\r\nmembers put forward a number of ideas with regard to\r\na better presentation of the Security Council’s annual\r\nreport to the General Assembly. The Council has taken\r\naccount of them, and I should like to stress here that\r\nthe credit for that goes in large part to the Mission of\r\nSingapore. In that regard, I should like to express once\r\nagain our deep appreciation to Ambassador Kishore\r\nMahbubani and his team, whose commitment made it\r\npossible to properly focus the innovations included in\r\nthe present report. Thus, the report is more than 300\r\npages shorter than last year’s report, while containing\r\nmore statistics on the deliberations and results of\r\nSecurity Council activities. The reduced format in\r\nwhich this report is submitted has saved the\r\nOrganization approximately $300,000.\r\nWith regard to those statistics, we should\r\nemphasize that the Security Council held 264 official\r\nmeetings, 91 more than during last year’s reporting\r\nperiod; it adopted 75 resolutions, 23 more than last\r\nyear; it adopted 47 official presidential statements, 12\r\nmore than last year; and it published 61 official\r\ncommuniqués and held 26 meetings with troop-\r\ncontributing countries.\r\nThe holding of a large number of public, as well\r\nas Arria-formula meetings demonstrates the Security\r\nCouncil’s clear desire to make its work more\r\ntransparent and effective, with the objective of\r\npromoting the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nAnother important improvement is the inclusion\r\nin the introduction of the report of an analytical\r\noverview of the Council’s activities.\r\nI would like to invite members of the General\r\nAssembly requiring further information to refer to\r\ndocument S/2002/603 of 6 June 2002, drawn up by the\r\nSecretariat and circulated as a document of the\r\nCouncil; the note from the President of the Security\r\nCouncil contained in document S/2002/199 of 22 May\r\n2002; and the record of the 4616th meeting of the\r\nCouncil held on 26 September 2002 (S/PV.4616).\r\nMembers of the Assembly will find in those documents\r\nan exhaustive record of all of the innovations that I\r\nhave just summarized.\r\nNext week the Council plans to hold an\r\ninteractive debate on the outcome of the Assembly’s\r\nwork today and tomorrow. This demonstrates the\r\ninterest and expectations of the Security Council with\r\nrespect to the judgements and useful proposals that are\r\nsubmitted to it by the General Assembly. We are\r\nparticularly interested in the response of members to\r\nour working methods and our work, which is always\r\nsensitive in nature and often complex.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like solemnly to express\r\nmy appreciation to all the members of the Council\r\nwithout exception for their commitment and their\r\ndedication to the cause of peace and security. I would\r\nalso like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nenlightened vision and the Security Council secretariat\r\nfor its professionalism and invaluable daily support.\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock (United Kingdom): I am\r\ngrateful to the Permanent Representative of Cameroon\r\nfor introducing this year’s report (A/57/2 and Corr.1)\r\nof the Security Council so comprehensively and ably,\r\nand I echo his expression of gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Secretariat for supporting the Council\r\nso effectively.\r\nI am delighted that this debate concerns a report\r\nof the Security Council whose format is much\r\nimproved in comparison with those of previous years. I\r\npay tribute to the initiative and energy of Ambassador\r\nMahbubani and the delegation of Singapore in leading\r\nthe Council in the production of a slimmer and more\r\ninformative report. The United Kingdom was pleased\r\nto contribute to the new format by providing the draft\r\nof the introductory section, in which for the first time\r\nthe Council has laid out a description of its substantive\r\nbusiness over the year.\r\nI believe that this innovation goes some way\r\ntowards responding to the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to have a fuller and more interactive debate\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nwith the Security Council on the business on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda, virtually all of which is of great\r\nimportance to the United Nations membership as a\r\nwhole. I believe that the two institutions are beginning\r\nto understand each other better in this area. The\r\nCouncil is making a genuine attempt to be more open\r\nand transparent in its business. The period under\r\nreview — mid-June 2001 to the end of July 2002 —\r\nwas an exceptionally busy one. The Council has\r\nnevertheless taken care to hold as many open meetings\r\nas possible to encourage the wider membership to\r\nremain in touch with its business. The United Kingdom\r\npresidency in July this year, for instance, scheduled 29\r\nopen meetings — a record to date. I wonder whether\r\nthat record will last for long.\r\nThe Council’s output in resolutions, presidential\r\nstatements and statements to the press continues to\r\nincrease at a rate which challenges our capacity to\r\nmanage all of the requirements put upon us. We must\r\ncontinue changing in order to keep up.\r\nI hope that members of the General Assembly\r\nrecognize that we have tried to be more transparent in\r\nquality as well as in quantity. In that context, I wish to\r\nplace on record my gratitude to members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for their exceptional response to the\r\novertures of the Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nestablished pursuant to Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001). Their cooperation has been vital to that\r\nexercise, and I hope that the Committee’s willingness\r\nto explain its work programme, its methods of business\r\nand its general approach to the implementation of that\r\nresolution has been one of the features behind the\r\nexcellent work we and the members of the Assembly\r\nhave done together since October 2001.\r\nOn the subject of combating terrorism, of course,\r\nwe have only just begun, as the ghastly attack this\r\nweekend in Bali demonstrates. I express my sincere\r\ncondolences to the Indonesian authorities and to the\r\nfamilies of all the victims of that dreadful attack.\r\nThe opening up of the Council goes beyond the\r\nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Many\r\nelected members of the Council have been exemplary\r\nin living up to their campaign promises to keep the\r\nwider membership informed. I welcome that, provided\r\nthat necessary confidences are kept. I hope that\r\npermanent members, too, have been marked for\r\nprogress in that area. The United Kingdom has no\r\nillusions: it needs — and it has — a constituency in the\r\nwider membership as a whole. We look for, and we\r\nmust earn, the support of the Assembly and its\r\nconstructive contributions to Council business, whether\r\nin the area of troop contributions or general ideas, and\r\nwe will continue to be as open as possible, beyond\r\nformal meetings, in our exchanges with Member\r\nStates, individually and collectively.\r\nThe Security Council has also become more\r\noperational and more targeted in its handling of the\r\npeace and security agenda. Since September 1999, we\r\nhave developed — to an extraordinary degree, I\r\nthink — the practice of sending missions to troubled\r\nregions of the world that are on our agenda. The\r\nimprovements — relative, perhaps, but improvements\r\nnonetheless — in the situations in East Timor, which is\r\nnow our glorious new Member, Timor-Leste; in the\r\nBalkans; and in Sierra Leone are evident. Our four\r\nmissions in successive years to the Great Lakes area,\r\nunder able United States and French leadership, are at\r\nlast beginning to bear fruit. In New York we have\r\nbegun to develop resolutions and mandates that are\r\nbetter tailored to, and more carefully aligned with, the\r\nrealities. While there is still room for improvement and\r\nfor more productive exchanges with troop contributors\r\nin particular, I believe that we are heading in the right\r\ndirection. We have to remember that Security Council\r\nmembers, primarily responsible as we are for\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, are not\r\nthe only actors in any particular situation. The parties\r\non the ground in a conflict or post-conflict situation\r\nhave a greater responsibility, and usually a greater\r\nopportunity, to make constructive progress than do we\r\nin New York. But the Security Council has to show the\r\nresponsibility, the power and the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations; and we have to demonstrate leadership\r\nif it is lacking in the situation on the ground. I believe\r\nthat there are many instances where the Council has\r\ndone these things over the past year.\r\nBefore I touch on one or two specific issues, let\r\nme also comment on the Council’s practice of taking\r\nup generic themes in our debates. We believe that\r\nprogress has been made, and significant encouragement\r\ngiven in the right quarters, in our debates on gender\r\nissues, on the protection of civilians in armed conflict,\r\non children and armed conflict, and on human rights\r\nwithin the rubric of peace and security.\r\nAgain, like so many parts of the United Nations,\r\nwe are struggling to move from the general to the\r\nparticular, to produce results that really matter on the\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nground. But I am pleased that, during the United\r\nKingdom presidency of the Council in July, we were\r\nable to conduct a forward-looking debate on gender\r\nissues, which now need to be mainstreamed into the\r\nwork of the Security Council, and that in addition we\r\nmanaged to hold an interesting workshop on the\r\nlessons learnt in Sierra Leone and on how to apply\r\nthem to accelerate the process of bringing peace and\r\nthe beginnings of prosperity to the West African\r\nsubregion as a whole. Every operational organ or the\r\nUnited Nations, not excluding the General Assembly,\r\nshould conduct self-assessments of its performance\r\nnow and again.\r\nI want to make a personal comment about the\r\nnature of our political work at the United Nations. The\r\nSecurity Council maintains a high profile and receives\r\nbroad media attention, because it deals with political\r\nand security situations of a high intensity, at least in the\r\nshort term. But the United Nations was never really\r\nconstructed for — and has only rarely been very good\r\nat — resolving political and security issues in short\r\norder. The great power, and the great utility, of the\r\nUnited Nations is in setting longer-term trends across a\r\nwhole range of global issues — economic, social,\r\nenvironmental, cultural and, of course, political,\r\nbecause all these elements have to evolve in a political\r\ncontext.\r\nThe commanding underlying theme of the work\r\nof the United Nations is development, which means the\r\nmore equal distribution of the world’s opportunities\r\namong the world’s peoples. Conflict prevention and\r\nconflict resolution are, in that sense, a subcategory of\r\nour work to promote sustainable development.\r\nMembers of the Security Council need from time to\r\ntime to reflect that, important as they may regard their\r\nefforts in that Chamber, the results must contribute to\r\nthe wider success of the work of the United Nations.\r\nMutual cooperation and respect between all the organs\r\nand institutions of the United Nations are essential, if\r\nwe are collectively to be assessed as operating\r\nsuccessfully.\r\nAgainst that background, it remains significant\r\nthat the lion’s share of the Council’s work — about\r\ntwo-thirds, in fact — continues to be on African\r\nconflicts. The scorecard is mixed. The situation in\r\nSierra Leone is much improved over two years ago,\r\nthanks in part to prompt and courageous action by the\r\nCouncil and the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL), backed up by significant other\r\ninput, during 2000 and 2001. Ethiopia and Eritrea\r\npeacekeeping and peacemaking efforts continue to be\r\nmodestly encouraging, and I believe that the progress\r\nnow developing in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo has, for the first time, the potential to offer the\r\nprospect of peace for that troubled country.\r\nBut on all three of those issues, much more\r\nremains to be done. The situation in Angola has taken a\r\nturn for the better this year, and I hope that Angola will\r\nbenefit from an upgraded United Nations presence and\r\nfrom the engagement of a new Special Representative\r\nof the Secretary-General. The news is less good on\r\nBurundi, where the Council has not yet found it\r\npossible to become fully engaged. And Somalia and the\r\nSudan continue to present the international community\r\nwith seemingly intractable problems. Africa remains\r\nthe biggest challenge for the Council’s agenda. Britain\r\nand France will work in increasingly close partnership\r\nto meet it.\r\nThe Council did some excellent work on\r\nAfghanistan during the period under review. Much of\r\nthe credit for the change in the situation there is due to\r\nthe Secretary-General and to his Special\r\nRepresentative, Lakhdar Brahimi. But the Council\r\nmoved swiftly to set in place the framework for the\r\nInternational Security Assistance Force and to establish\r\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan\r\n(UNAMA). Afghanistan is an excellent example of\r\nwhere the United Nations adds value with a light\r\nfootprint. But the story there is certainly not finished.\r\nThe Middle East peace process remains an issue\r\nwith respect to which the Council continues to have\r\ndifficulties. Perhaps it is the most troubled of all the\r\nissues before the Council. But we have made progress\r\nin some respects: monthly briefings from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral or the Secretariat; and a greater degree of\r\nconsensus, or near-consensus, on the decisions of the\r\nCouncil in the period under review than in the period\r\nbefore that. Perhaps we should have been ready to\r\naccept that on occasion a rapid press statement may be\r\nmore effective than a long wrangle leading to failure on\r\nmore ambitious propositions. The Council needs to\r\nfocus on where, within the political realities, it can\r\nmake a difference and add value. I am particularly\r\npleased that the European Union members of the\r\nCouncil have worked well together on this vital issue.\r\nMore of that will be seen in future.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nAnother issue in that neighbourhood has risen\r\nfast on our agenda recently. Member States will be\r\ngenerally aware of the latest state of play on Iraq. The\r\nissue will shortly come to the Security Council as a\r\nwhole, but in recent days not even the permanent\r\nmembers have been in a position to do any negotiation\r\nin New York. The United Kingdom believes that the\r\nUnited Nations must rise to the challenge on Iraq’s\r\nrepeated violations of international law. Disarmament\r\nunder United Nations arrangements is the objective. To\r\nachieve this, we have to give the United Nations\r\ninspectors the strongest powers possible to ensure\r\nsuccessful disarmament and to make it crystal-clear to\r\nIraq that, this time, it is complete disarmament or\r\nserious consequences. It is important that the Council\r\nshould consult the membership as a whole before\r\ntaking action, and the United Kingdom is pleased that\r\nthe open debate on Wednesday will allow full\r\ndiscussion of the issue.\r\nI should comment, finally, on Security Council\r\nreform. The United Kingdom remains committed to\r\nachieving a comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in all its aspects. Our approach at the fifty-\r\nsixth session continued to be one of narrowing the\r\nareas of disagreement. The United Kingdom regrets\r\nthat there has been little progress so far this year.\r\nDespite all the frustration that is understandably felt,\r\nthe United Kingdom remains committed to making real\r\nprogress on Security Council reform during this new\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and we will support\r\nthe President of the General Assembly in any\r\nconstructive initiative which he takes to this end.\r\nBut reform does not mean just change in the\r\nmembership. Continuing improvements in our working\r\nmethods are equally important. As I have made clear,\r\nthe United Kingdom supports a Security Council which\r\nis transparent and which relates to the wider\r\nmembership. I would add only that the membership of\r\nthe General Assembly has to play its part too. General\r\nAssembly reform is itself essential, and we must try in\r\nour debates to get away from prepared speeches and\r\npredictable statements of national position. The United\r\nNations has work to do and results to achieve which\r\nmake a difference for people riven by conflict and\r\npoverty. The way in which we debate and interact can\r\nmake a significant difference.\r\nPerhaps the constant emphasis from the British on\r\npragmatism, results and cooperation brings smiles to\r\nthe faces of our colleagues. But does not the United\r\nNations, and do not the billions of people dependent on\r\nour effectiveness, now need those things more than\r\never before?\r\nMrs. Ahmed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Allow\r\nme at the outset to thank the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on the Question of Equitable Representation on\r\nand Increase in the Membership of the Security\r\nCouncil and Other Matters Related to the Security\r\nCouncil, under the leadership of the Ambassador\r\nMahbubani, for its ongoing work in the framework of\r\nreforming the Security Council in order to increase its\r\nmembership, achieve equitable representation within it\r\nand address related matters. We also thank the\r\nAmbassador of Cameroon for introducing the report\r\nunder consideration.\r\nMy delegation wishes to call attention to\r\nparagraph 20 of the Secretary-General’s report\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: An agenda for\r\nfurther change,” in which the Secretary-General asserts\r\nthat no progress has been achieved in the work of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council. Despite the fact that\r\nthe General Assembly established the Working Group\r\nover 10 years ago, there is no clear understanding on\r\nhow to improve the Council’s working methods or\r\nincrease its membership. This failing will have a\r\nnegative impact on the general concept of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe process of reforming and strengthening the\r\nOrganization cannot be completed if it does not include\r\none of its most important organs, entrusted with\r\nallaying threats to international peace and security, as\r\nprovided for in Article 24 of the Charter, which assigns\r\nthe Council the primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security on\r\nbehalf of the entire membership of the Organization.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is one of the\r\nmain challenges facing the United Nations at the dawn\r\nof this millennium, despite the fact that States are\r\nagreed on the need to change the Council’s\r\ncomposition. Regrettably, however, there has been no\r\nclear agreement on the form which such changes are to\r\ntake. It is now up to the General Assembly, the\r\nsupreme organ of the United Nations, to present\r\npractical proposals and in-depth analyses and to make\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nrecommendations on matters related to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe improvement that has been made to the\r\nSecurity Council’s work by increasing the number of\r\nits plenary and open meetings, thus making it more\r\nopen, effective and transparent, is insufficient. In this\r\ncontext, we urge the Council to open all of its meetings\r\nand to eschew secrecy. This will bring further integrity\r\nand transparency into its work. The Council must\r\nrespond to earlier proposals that it engage in\r\nconsultations with the General Assembly and other\r\nbodies of the United Nations, such as the Economic\r\nand Social Council, and that it present periodic reports\r\nto the Assembly, as necessary. It is truly essential that\r\nthe Council’s decision-making process be improved in\r\norder to promote even more openness and transparency.\r\nThe principle of equitable representation is set\r\ndown in the United Nations Charter. It is imperative\r\nthat this principle be taken into account in all matters\r\nrelating to recruitment, appointment and election to\r\nvarious seats in various bodies. In this context, we\r\nwould emphasize the African position, defined at the\r\nmeeting of African leaders during the Millennium\r\nSummit and at other African summits on this issue, on\r\nthe reform of the Security Council and increase in its\r\nmembership. This position calls for the continent to be\r\nassigned two permanent and non-permanent seats. In\r\nthis context, we point to the large increase in the\r\nmembership of the United Nations, which now stands\r\nat 191 States, most of them developing countries.\r\nThe use of the veto is incompatible with the\r\nconcept of justice and equality that is called for in\r\nrelations among States and highlighted by the Charter.\r\nAdopting Security Council resolutions through\r\ndialogue and consensus is the best way to ensure\r\ntransparency, integrity and justice. We therefore join\r\nothers who share the opinion that the right of veto, as a\r\ncontravention of established principles, should be\r\nabolished and that the arbitrary use of this right should\r\nbe limited until that comes about. This will help to\r\nsecure more equitable representation within the United\r\nNations, in accordance with the principle of sovereign\r\nequality among nations and other relevant provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter. The comprehensive reform\r\nof the Security Council to which we all look forward\r\ncannot be achieved if some States continue to uphold\r\ntheir narrow interests at the expense of the reform\r\nprocess.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to stress the importance of\r\nestablishing a balance and of activating cooperation\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. This will preserve the genuine expression of\r\nthe will of the international community, represented\r\nmost fully by the General Assembly, including in the\r\nsearch for solutions to problems which the Security\r\nCouncil has hitherto failed to solve. Prominent among\r\nthese issues is the situation in the Middle East and the\r\nneed to put an end to the Israeli occupation of\r\nPalestinian and other occupied Arab territories.\r\nMr. Mahbubani (Singapore): As I look around\r\nthe Hall, I must confess that I regret the poor turnout\r\nwe have this morning. When we walk in the corridors,\r\nthe most frequent complaint we hear is that the\r\nSecurity Council is not open and transparent. Here, at a\r\ntime when we have an opportunity to discuss the\r\nSecurity Council, there is such a low turnout. I hope\r\nthat, in the course of the day, the turnout will improve.\r\nIn two and a half months, Singapore will\r\ncomplete its term on the Security Council. The\r\nquestion we are most frequently asked is this: “Well,\r\nhow has the experience been?” Clearly, it is not easy to\r\nsummarize what has been a rich and complex\r\nexperience, but we have found a helpful analogy,\r\nwhich, like all analogies, is necessarily imperfect.\r\nJoining the Security Council, especially for the\r\nfirst time, as it was for Singapore, is like suddenly\r\njumping on a moving train. We scramble into the last\r\ncompartment. The train keeps moving on rapidly, often\r\nat a quickening pace. We move from compartment to\r\ncompartment, trying to understand the inner workings\r\nof one of the most important vehicles of international\r\npeace and security, but in two years we do not quite\r\nmake it into the engine room. Certainly, we never make\r\nit into the driver’s seat.\r\nWhen the two years are up, we will be thrown off\r\nthis moving train. It will keep on moving with five new\r\npassengers. We are not giving away any great secret if\r\nwe reveal that the main directions of this train are set\r\nby the five permanent occupants. How could it be\r\notherwise? I want to add, however, that even the\r\npermanent occupants have found the need to adjust to a\r\nrapidly changing international landscape.\r\nOver time, we have found that it has become\r\neasier to look into the compartments of the train,\r\nwhether you are inside or outside. More open meetings\r\nhave been held; more wrap-up sessions have been held;\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nmore briefings have been provided; and certainly the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, under the leadership of\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock, has been a model of openness\r\nand set new standards for Security Council\r\ntransparency.\r\nIn that regard, let me mention that the latest\r\nterrorist attack, in Bali, only reinforces the importance\r\nof the battle we are fighting against terrorism. We\r\ncondemn that attack. We also offer our condolences to\r\nthe families that lost their loved ones.\r\nThis year’s annual report clearly signals a\r\nsignificant effort by the Security Council to respond to\r\nthe concerns expressed by Member States at the\r\nAssembly’s annual debate on this item. I will not go\r\ninto the details of the changes, because the President of\r\nthe Security Council, Ambassador Martin Belinga-\r\nEboutou, already spelled out the changes in a statement\r\nhe made earlier today. But I would like to point out that\r\nit is nice to see the report go from its size last year to\r\nits present size — I think it is about half the size of\r\nwhat it was last year. I also want to thank those who\r\nhave commended Singapore for its contributions in that\r\nregard.\r\nBut the most significant innovation is not found\r\nin the report. Instead it can be found in the provisional\r\nverbatim record of the Security Council meeting that\r\ntook place when the report was adopted, on 26\r\nSeptember 2002. That record is contained in document\r\nS/PV.4616. As the President of the Security Council\r\nsaid earlier, we should also refer to this document when\r\nwe participate in the debate today. We hope that this\r\ndocument will be read carefully by all participants. Let\r\nme explain the significance of that provisional\r\nverbatim record. Last year, when the Council met on 18\r\nSeptember 2001 to adopt its annual report (A/56/2),\r\nboth Ambassador Valdivieso of Colombia and I were\r\nsurprised that the report was being adopted without any\r\ndiscussion. As Ambassador Valdivieso said last year,\r\n“we should not limit ourselves to hearing an\r\nexplanatory statement from the Secretariat —\r\nfrom Mr. Fall — but … members of the Council\r\nshould also make comments on the subject.”\r\n(S/PV.4375, p. 3)\r\nFortunately, this year Ambassador Valdivieso’s\r\nwish has came true. This year, for the first time ever,\r\nall 15 members of the Council made comments, both\r\non the report and the work of the Council. Many\r\nincisive and insightful comments were made. In the full\r\ntext of my statement I cite the comment made by\r\nAmbassador Gerard Corr of Ireland. I will not read it\r\nout, but members will notice that he makes an\r\nimportant point, namely, that the world that the Council\r\ndeals with in the issues on its agenda is inherently\r\nuntidy in many respects. I want to add that the same\r\nuntidiness and complexity about which Ambassador\r\nCorr spoke bedevilled our efforts to try to improve the\r\nannual report. We thought last year that reducing the\r\nsize of the report should have been an open and shut\r\ncase. Unfortunately, we met heavy resistance, for\r\nreasons we do not yet fully understand. Of course, we\r\ndiscovered that the Council is a conservative\r\ninstitution. But I also want to add here the comment\r\nmade by Ambassador Levitte on 26 September 2002:\r\n“If we take a look at the development of the\r\nSecurity Council’s working methods since its\r\ncreation more than 50 years ago, we can see that\r\nwe have gone from a period of hibernation to a\r\nperiod of increasingly rapid development.”\r\n(S/PV.4616, p. 7)\r\nI noticed that he was quite honest in talking about\r\nhibernation. He then added that “If we compare the\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly, we could say that in\r\nthis friendly competition, the Council has taken the\r\nlead.” (ibid.)\r\nOne question that we need to ask in assessing this\r\nyear’s annual report is clear: have the innovations gone\r\nfar enough? The simple answer is obviously not. Some\r\nmanifest absurdities remain in the present report. Look,\r\nfor example, at page 191 of the report, where, as\r\nAmbassador Valdivieso has said, there is a laughable\r\ndescription of the Council’s consideration of the Nobel\r\nPeace Prize. Pages like that can clearly be removed\r\nfrom the report. We hope that next year’s report will\r\nagain be half as thin as this year’s report. We think it\r\ncan be done. Unfortunately, we will not be there to do\r\nit.\r\nDespite the enormous time and effort we have put\r\ninto trying to transform the report, one key point we\r\nwould like to make is that the General Assembly does\r\nnot need to rely solely on this report to assess the\r\nperformance of the Security Council. Certainly, it helps\r\nto get the perspective of the passengers on the train.\r\nBut often those watching from outside can see the\r\ndirection of the train more clearly than the passengers\r\nin the train. In the case of the Council, the results of\r\nthe Council’s work — both its successes and\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nfailures — are clearly visible and tangible. In our\r\nstatement today we will not do what several other\r\ndelegations will be doing: looking at specific items\r\nregarding the Council’s performance, its successes and\r\nfailures. In a statement we made in December 2001 we\r\ngave an assessment of the successes and failures for\r\nthat year. In that regard, I urge members to look at\r\ndocument S/PV.4445, of 21 December 2001.\r\nWe also stated our views in connection with the\r\nsuccesses and failures over the past year in our\r\nstatement in the Council on 26 September 2002 (see\r\ndocument S/PV.4616), so we will not repeat what we\r\nsaid then. But we want to suggest that as we assess the\r\nperformance of the Council, it may be useful if all of us\r\ncould try to arrive at some agreed criteria for how we\r\nshould assess the performance of the Council. In this\r\nregard, when we spoke in the Council on 26 September\r\n2002, we suggested four questions. They are on the\r\nrecord, but let me just mention them quickly.\r\nThe first question is an obvious one: has the\r\nCouncil successfully managed the issues under its\r\npurview? Have lives been saved or improved by the\r\nCouncil’s work? Secondly, has the Council improved\r\nits procedures and working methods to generate greater\r\nefficiency and effectiveness in its work? Thirdly, has\r\nthe Council become more transparent and open in its\r\nwork and in its relationship with the wider United\r\nNations membership? Fourthly, has the Council\r\nenhanced or diminished its credibility and prestige in\r\nthe international community? At the Council debate on\r\n26 September 2002, Ambassador Greenstock suggested\r\nan additional question. He asked “whether the Council\r\nhas responded adequately to the greater demands put\r\nupon it by the process of globalization” (S/PV.4616,\r\np. 11). He added that we have to recognize that the\r\nworld is moving faster than the Council.\r\nThat indeed is the central challenge of our times.\r\nThe world is certainly racing ahead. The multilateral\r\ninstitutions are either standing still or moving slowly.\r\nEach institution should evaluate what it has to do to\r\ncatch up. Hence, as one of the two suggestions we\r\nprovided on 26 September 2002 to improve the\r\nperformance of the Council, we said that the Council\r\nshould do more strategic reviews of its work, more\r\noften than the one time we do so when we meet in the\r\nannual retreat with the Secretary-General. Indeed, it is\r\nsurprising for a body as important as the Security\r\nCouncil not to meet more often to engage in an overall\r\nstrategic review of its work.\r\nThat is, again, why we are glad that the President\r\nof the Assembly has decided to cluster the two items\r\ntoday. Items 11 and 40 go hand in hand. The expansion\r\nof the Council — on which there is no longer any\r\ndebate; we all agree that it should be expanded — goes\r\nhand in hand with its performance. The purpose of the\r\nexpansion is to enhance performance, not to diminish\r\nit.\r\nFor the record, I should say that we have\r\nexpressed our well-known views on Security Council\r\nexpansion. We will not repeat them today, as they are\r\nin our past statements. But we want to emphasize one\r\ndimension, namely that to achieve enhanced\r\nperformance we have to address squarely the question\r\nof the veto. Again, the full of this statement includes an\r\nextended quotation from Inis Claude’s classic book\r\nentitled Swords Into Ploughshares. In that book the\r\nauthor talks about the understanding that was reached\r\nwhen the veto was created. Perhaps one of the key\r\npoints he makes is that that the third objective was “to\r\ngain assurance that the most powerful members would\r\ninitiate and support positive collective action within\r\nand on behalf of the organization in times of crisis”.\r\nThe point here is simple and clear: the purpose of\r\nthe veto is to promote collective, not national, interests.\r\nThere was, I guess, from the beginning, and even now,\r\nan implicit social contract. The power of the veto was\r\nconferred by the Members that ratified the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations. In return they expected the veto to\r\nbe used to promote collective security.\r\nHerein lies the nub of the problem we face. All\r\nMembers of the United Nations, both the veto-bearing\r\nand non-veto-bearing Members, have made a\r\ncommitment to promote the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter. Yet each time we cast a vote, whether\r\nin the General Assembly or the Security Council, more\r\noften than not we put our short-term national interests\r\nahead of our long-term collective interests. This is a\r\ndeep structural problem that undermines the\r\nperformance of both the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI want to conclude by citing one simple example\r\nof how this deep structural problem seriously cripples\r\nefforts to improve the performance of the Security\r\nCouncil, a goal that we all ostensibly share. The only\r\neffective way to improve the performance of any\r\norganization, whether it is in business — certainly in\r\nthe last few months we have seen how confidence in\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nthis sphere can be dramatically eroded — or in\r\ngovernment or non-governmental organizations is to\r\nhold the organization accountable. So, too, the Security\r\nCouncil has to be held accountable. The only question\r\nis, who is going to hold the Council accountable?\r\nThe only effective way to hold the Council\r\naccountable is to commit a large amount of resources\r\nto monitoring its work. It is important to recognize that\r\nthe growth of that work has exploded in recent years,\r\nboth in quantity and complexity, and hence a\r\nsignificant amount of resources, both material and\r\nintellectual, will be needed to adequately monitor and\r\nassess the performance of the Council. I can say this\r\nhaving served as a member of the Council for the past\r\n22 months. Even as one serves as a member, it is\r\nalmost impossible to follow everything that the Council\r\ndoes because of its different working groups, sanctions\r\ncommittees and the other sub-bodies of the United\r\nNations. Therefore a tremendous amount of resources\r\nwill be required in order to really monitor the Council.\r\nThe question here is, who will do the job? One obvious\r\ncandidate is the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council Reform.\r\nWhile we emphasize the importance of\r\naccountability, I want to stress that the pursuit of\r\naccountability will serve the interests of both the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. For the\r\nSecurity Council, greater accountability will inevitably\r\nlead to an even better performance and, consequently,\r\nto greater prestige and standing on the world stage.\r\nThe General Assembly, on the other hand,\r\nprovides the legitimacy that ensures international\r\ncompliance with Security Council decisions. Without\r\nthe General Assembly, the Security Council would be\r\nessentially half a body. Hence there is an essential\r\nsymbiotic relationship between the Council and the\r\nAssembly. Each needs the other. The greater the trust\r\nand confidence between these two vital organs of the\r\nUnited Nations, the better the international system will\r\nbe. Therefore it serves the interest of both to equally\r\npromote the pursuit of accountability.\r\nFinally, as we did last year, under the Irish\r\npresidency of the Council, this year the Council will,\r\nunder Cameroon’s presidency, discuss the comments\r\nand suggestions raised at this Assembly general debate,\r\nreflect on the key points made and consider further\r\nimprovements to the Council’s working methods, its\r\nwork and future reports.\r\nLast year the Singapore delegation rendered a\r\nsmall service to the Council by compiling all the\r\nsummaries of the statements that were made during this\r\ndebate and distributing them to members of the\r\nSecurity Council. We will be happy to provide the\r\nsame service this year.\r\nWe will do our best to contribute to the\r\ndiscussions in the Security Council to maintain and\r\nimprove the relationship of trust and confidence\r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. As I said earlier, the President has made a\r\nmajor contribution by clustering these two agenda\r\nitems together. Both in symbolic and in substantive\r\nterms, the Council has sent a clear message that the\r\nSecurity Council and the Open-ended Working Group\r\nneed to cooperate closely. We hope this will happen in\r\nthe coming years.\r\nMr. Siv (United States of America): Let me first\r\nexpress our condolences to the Indonesian and\r\nAustralian delegations, as well as many others for the\r\nhundreds of innocents killed in the brutal attack in Bali\r\nover the weekend. We mourn for those killed and pray\r\nfor the injured of every nationality. Nothing can justify\r\nthis terrorist act. The United States will stand with you\r\nin ensuring that those who committed this are brought\r\nto justice.\r\nThe United States is committed to strengthening\r\nthe Security Council and to help it perform its\r\nimportant functions more effectively. Enlarging the\r\nCouncil is a means to that end, not the end in itself. A\r\nreformed Council, with Japan and Germany assuming\r\npermanent seats and with an expanded number of\r\nrotating seats, would better enable the Council to\r\nexercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security under the Charter.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil Reform is entering its ninth year of\r\ndeliberations. This is indicative of the complexity of\r\nthe issues that remain to be resolved. They include a\r\nbalancing representation between the developed and\r\ndeveloping countries, achieving appropriate and\r\nequitable representation among regions and ensuring\r\nthat Council enlargement does not curtail its ability to\r\nact promptly and decisively.\r\nDespite these challenges, we want the Open-\r\nended Working Group to succeed in building as broad a\r\nconsensus as possible. To move forward, it is necessary\r\nto seriously analyse the various models for an\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nexpanded Council, to determine how to make it\r\nstronger and more effective. This will require genuine\r\nand broad support. To get there, we cannot divorce the\r\ndiscussion from issues of the expanded Council’s\r\nultimate size and composition. Doing so merely\r\nensures more delay.\r\nIt will come as no surprise that we will continue\r\nto oppose efforts to limit or eliminate the veto. These\r\ninitiatives only serve to stifle progress on the important\r\ntask ahead of us. The veto remains an essential element\r\nof the Council’s ability to maintain international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn bolstering the effectiveness of the Council, the\r\nUnited States will work through the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group and in any discussions to ensure that\r\nthe Council continues to be the lynchpin of\r\ninternational peace and security. We will also join with\r\nothers in making the Council more transparent and\r\nrepresentative of the entire membership. That is\r\nimportant work, and we are fully engaged. We hope\r\nthat we can make real progress on all these issues in\r\nthe coming session.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Stagno (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\npursuit of security poses a dilemma. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral wisely noted, no State can increase its level of\r\nsecurity to the detriment of others. Inevitably, other\r\nStates construe as a veiled threat any unilateral action\r\naimed at acquiring greater guarantees of security.\r\nAbsolute security for one State necessarily means\r\nabsolute insecurity for others.\r\nThis dilemma can only be solved through\r\nmultilateral action. It is impossible to ensure the\r\nsovereignty of one State at the expense of the\r\nsovereignty of others. All nations have an equal right to\r\nsovereignty, in a climate of mutual respect and\r\ncooperation. Only joint action will enable us to\r\nattain — jointly — greater security, peace and freedom.\r\nIn this context, the Security Council is the only\r\nuniversal mechanism that makes it possible for all of us\r\ncollectively to enjoy true security. We must not allow\r\nthe Council to be weakened by unilateral action. We\r\ncannot accept the Council’s exclusion from the most\r\nimportant decisions of international peace and security,\r\nthus eroding its authority. We cannot consent to it\r\nbecoming an instrument of a small group of States,\r\nthus losing its legitimacy. We cannot accept the\r\nconcession of additional privileges to the permanent\r\nmembers or the exclusion of the elected members from\r\nthe decision-making process, who thus lose their\r\nrepresentation.\r\nThe world expects greater leadership from the\r\nUnited Nations. The people demand firm and decisive\r\naction of the international community. For that reason,\r\nwe must support and strengthen the Security Council.\r\nAll States must scrupulously observe the absolute\r\nprohibition of the use of force. The Security Council\r\nmust never transfer, abandon or renounce its primary\r\nresponsibility to maintain peace and security. The\r\nmembers of the Security Council must always act in\r\nthe spirit of the principles embodied in the United\r\nNations Charter. Their actions should never be\r\nmotivated by internal political considerations.\r\nIn previous years, my delegation was highly\r\ncritical of the work of the Security Council. We\r\nquestioned, in particular, the creation of peacekeeping\r\noperations without the necessary human and financial\r\nresources as well as the imposition of sanctions\r\nregimes that harmed the innocent civilian population.\r\nThe situation has changed. Recently, we have\r\nwitnessed the adoption of more realistic mandates in\r\nkeeping with the resources available. Undoubtedly, the\r\nSecurity Council has learned from its mistakes.\r\nHowever, we fear that this newly found caution\r\nmight have led the Security Council to shirk from its\r\nprimary responsibility of facing firmly, decisively and\r\ncourageously all threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. We believe that the Council did not do all that\r\nit could have done to solve the most recent crises in the\r\nMiddle Fast, in the Indian subcontinent and in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nIt is essential that the Security Council today\r\nassume all its responsibilities. It cannot continue\r\nreacting to political and military crises with feeble\r\ndeclarations to the press. It cannot continue\r\ncondemning massive violations of human rights with\r\nempty declarations and ephemeral commitments. This\r\norgan must take up again the leading role in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe adoption of resolution 1373 (2001) gave us\r\nnew hope. It is evidence of  the capacity of the Security\r\nCouncil to face new challenges as long as the necessary\r\npolitical will exists. We would like to see the same\r\nreadiness and commitment in the implementation of all\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nthe other resolutions adopted by this organ, including\r\nthose on the various arms and diamonds embargoes.\r\nIn the long run, increasing the Security Council’s\r\nlegitimacy and its capacity for action is vital. In this\r\ncontext, the process of the reform and revitalization of\r\nthe Council plays a central role in the design of the\r\nfuture structure of the international community.\r\nThe work of the Security Council must be\r\ngenuinely transparent. We have noted the efforts to\r\nhold a greater number of public meetings. However,\r\nmost of them are devoted to the consideration of\r\ngeneral topics, which, by their nature, correspond to\r\nthe General Assembly, the main deliberative body of\r\nthe Organization. True transparency will be attained\r\nonly when the consultations among the Council’s\r\nmembers and the periodic presentation of reports by\r\nthe Secretary-General or his representatives are held in\r\npublic meetings.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must\r\ntransform it into a more representative and democratic\r\norgan. Unfortunately, its efficacy has been limited by\r\nthe most serious injustices in its composition, working\r\nmethods and decision-making process. The current\r\nstructure of the Security Council does not reflect either\r\nthe current composition of the international community\r\nor the present distribution of power among nations. In\r\nparticular, it is essential that the Security Council\r\nreflect not only the military capability of the various\r\nactors in the international community but also their\r\neconomic influence and, above all, their moral\r\nauthority.\r\nCosta Rica favours an increase in the membership\r\nof the Security Council to make possible the greater\r\nrepresentation of developing countries in that organ.\r\nHowever, an increase in the Council’s membership is\r\nonly a secondary and subsidiary aspect of the reform\r\nand revitalization process. The regulation, limitation\r\nand eventual elimination of the veto must be the main\r\ngoal of the reform process. The existence of the veto\r\nright as a unilateral privilege is in itself an affront to\r\nthe basic principles of justice. That unjustifiable and\r\nanti-democratic privilege has paralyzed the Council\r\nand has contributed substantially to the erosion of its\r\nlegitimacy.\r\nWe cannot talk of a genuine reform of the\r\nSecurity Council unless those imbalances are corrected.\r\nRegrettably, after nine years of negotiations reform\r\nefforts have yet to bear fruit. We believe it is necessary\r\nto reconsider the process in depth.\r\nI wish to conclude by expressing the condolences\r\nof the Government and the people of Costa Rica to the\r\npeople of Indonesia and to the families of all the\r\nvictims of the abominable terrorist attack in Bali.\r\nMr. Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): I thank\r\nAmbassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Cameroon and current President of\r\nthe Security Council, for his presentation of the\r\nCouncil’s annual report.\r\nPeru is thankful for the efforts to improve the\r\nreport’s presentation. My delegation welcomes\r\nespecially the introductory chapter as a good starting\r\npoint for reflection and analysis of the Council’s\r\ntreatment of the issues before it.\r\nHowever, while this year’s report has a more\r\nadequate logical order, it still fails to present a clear\r\nand integral vision of international peace and security\r\nat the present time.\r\nIf a person reads a report of the International\r\nMonetary Fund or the World Bank, for example,\r\nwhether the reader agrees or disagrees with its\r\nassessments, he or she will gain a clear picture of the\r\ninternational economic and financial situation. That is\r\nnot true in the case of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWhile it is true that the report of the Security\r\nCouncil is intended for the Member States of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, it is no less true that it provides an\r\nexcellent opportunity to offer the collective society of\r\nthe world — investors, the academic sector, civil\r\nsociety, students and the general public — a clear and\r\ntransparent message illustrating the difficulties and\r\nlessons learned with respect to the challenges presented\r\nto international peace and security.\r\nFor example, a student of international relations\r\nwho would like to obtain an overall view of world\r\nsecurity from the report of the principal organ of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Security Council, would become\r\nlost in interminable lists of documents, written in near-\r\ncryptic jargon or intended for the few who are familiar\r\nwith such subjects, as we diplomats are.\r\nIt is certain that, in this globalized world, the\r\nSecurity Council’s intensive work and its principal\r\nefforts are not well communicated, are mostly\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nunrecognized and/or are poorly understood. In that\r\ncontext, it runs the risk — as do other organizations or\r\ninternational bodies — of becoming merely a\r\nsuspicious entity, lacking real significance, that says\r\nnothing to the international community and might be\r\noverlooked or superseded by unilateral actions or\r\nmeasures taken by regional bodies.\r\nMy country is making these comments because it\r\nsupports the work of the Security Council and wants to\r\nsee a Council that is more efficient, more successful,\r\nmore open to cooperation, more transparent and more\r\nunderstanding of the needs of the international\r\ncommunity. Peru believes firmly in multilateralism and\r\nin collective security as fundamental mechanisms for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nLast year, the Security Council began the fight\r\nagainst terrorism through an interactive process\r\nbetween that body and the rest of the Member States\r\nthat has been very positive. The Council’s Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee, led by Ambassador Greenstock\r\nof the United Kingdom, promoted an ongoing and\r\nopen-ended debate with non-Council members. That is\r\nan advance to which my country has contributed\r\nthrough the participation of an expert in the\r\nCommittee. We should also like these open-ended\r\nmeetings to continue in the future.\r\nThis process can be seen as part of the increase in\r\nopen Security Council meetings, held both to consider\r\nindividual topics and to present Secretariat reports on\r\nthe various items on the Council’s agenda. That is\r\nanother encouraging fact, as is the continuation of the\r\nwrap-up sessions, which Peru firmly supports because\r\nthey offer all States the opportunity to contribute to the\r\ndevelopment and consolidation of collective\r\ninternational security.\r\nHowever, that positive aspect has its negative\r\nside, which is that the proposals and ideas presented in\r\nopen meetings do not go beyond the Council Chamber.\r\nWhy not include a summary of such meetings in the\r\nreport of the Security Council? That would be valuable\r\ninformation clarifying the status of a particular topic at\r\na particular time. The country presiding over the\r\nCouncil could summarize open meetings. Because of\r\ntheir factual character, including them in the reports of\r\nthe presidency or of the Council should not pose a\r\nmajor problem.\r\nMy country also believes that the Council’s report\r\nshould include the arguments presented by the\r\npermanent members of the Security Council that\r\nexercise the veto power, in addition to information on\r\nCouncil resolutions that have not been complied\r\nwith — all as part of complete and transparent\r\ninformation about the Council, not only for the General\r\nAssembly, as I have said, but for the entire world.\r\nOtherwise, I reiterate, the international community\r\noutside the United Nations will not have a clear idea of\r\nwhat is happening in the Council. Such a complete lack\r\nof information clearly runs counter to the culture of\r\nglobal access to information in which we live as a\r\nresult of the advances in telecommunications and in\r\ndemocracy. If good information is to exist, there must\r\nalso be transparency within the Council itself, where\r\nsome areas of debate and decision-making seem to be\r\nthe permanent members’ private domain.\r\nI conclude by pointing out that these ideas and\r\nproposals have been presented mainly with the\r\nobjective of strengthening the image of the Security\r\nCouncil, as part of the current process of fostering\r\ntransparency and democracy that is spreading\r\nthroughout the world as the new global culture of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): At the outset, I should like to express our\r\nsincerest condolences to the Government and people of\r\nIndonesia and to the families of the victims of the\r\nterrorist attack that occurred in Bali.\r\nThis is the first time we are discussing together\r\ntwo priority items on the Assembly’s agenda: the report\r\nof the Security Council and reform of that body. The\r\nresults of this first experience will demonstrate in\r\npractice whether we should do the same in the future or\r\nwhether it would be more convenient to return to the\r\npractice of two separate debates.\r\nWe welcome the new format of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, particularly the inclusion for the first\r\ntime of a brief analytical summary. That constitutes a\r\nstep forward towards the objective of having truly\r\nsubstantive reports on the work of the Council. The\r\nCouncil’s report should reflect not only what has been\r\ndone, but also what it has been impossible to do and\r\nwhy. As Member States, we have the legitimate right\r\nand the duty to consider in depth the Council’s work\r\nand to determine if the Council is really acting on\r\nbehalf of all and fulfilling, as it should, the lofty\r\nresponsibilities conferred on it by the Charter.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nThere is no logical reason why the rules of\r\nprocedure of the Council continue to be provisional 57\r\nyears after the establishment of that body or why they\r\nhave not been amended in 20 years. Any changes to the\r\nrules adopted by the Council or to those that apply in\r\npractice should be set out in the rules of procedure.\r\nIt is true that the number of open meetings has\r\nincreased — that is a positive development. But the\r\nclosed informal consultations, which are not even\r\nprovided for in the provisional rules of procedure,\r\ncontinue to be the rule rather than the exception.\r\nNot only must the number of open meetings be\r\nincreased, but such meetings should provide a real\r\nopportunity for the opinions and contributions of non-\r\nmembers to be properly taken into account.\r\nUnless there are exceptional circumstances, the\r\ninformative briefings by the Secretariat and\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General should take\r\nplace in public meetings of the Council, not behind\r\nclosed doors, as almost always happens.\r\nThe wrap-up meetings at the end of each month\r\nshould become an established practice and be open to\r\nnon-members of the Council in order to permit a\r\ngenuine interactive exchange.\r\nWe consider the open debate on the work of the\r\nAd Hoc Working Group on Africa to have been\r\npositive. At the same time, we wonder why such\r\ndiscussions are not extended to the work of other\r\ngroups and subsidiary bodies of the Council, such as\r\nthe Working Groups established to consider sanctions\r\nand peacekeeping operations.\r\nWe raised concerns in a number of Security\r\nCouncil debates about the increasing tendency of that\r\nbody to assume functions outside its purview. One\r\nparticularly dangerous example of action by the\r\nCouncil in an area outside its mandate occurred this\r\nyear with the adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1422 (2002) on the International Criminal Court. That\r\nresolution extended to an unacceptable extent the\r\nauthority of the Security Council to amend\r\ninternational treaties — the exclusive right of the\r\nStates parties to such treaties.\r\nThe Security Council is not the appropriate body\r\nin which to debate treaty law or the International\r\nCriminal Court, for the simple reason that the Charter\r\ndoes not authorize it to do so.\r\nWhile the Security Council goes beyond its\r\nauthority on some subjects, we are concerned by its\r\nlack of action in other areas, such as the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories. It is unacceptable for that body\r\nto continue to turn its back on the suffering of the\r\nPalestinian people and fail to give serious\r\nconsideration to the Secretary-General’s proposal to\r\nestablish a multinational protection force in the\r\noccupied territories.\r\nWe are convinced that many of the problems that\r\ncurrently affect the work of the Security Council can be\r\nresolved only by a far-reaching reform of that body.\r\nCouncil reform is certainly the most urgent priority\r\ntask of the general United Nations reform effort, and\r\nthe outcome will to a great extent dictate the future of\r\nthe Organization. The Security Council is not, and\r\ncannot be, effective given its current composition and\r\nmethods of work. It is neither democratic, nor\r\nequitable, nor representative. It does not reflect the\r\ncurrent global realities nor does it represent the\r\ninterests of the membership of the United Nations.\r\nEven non-permanent members of the Council are\r\neffectively ignored when — as we have seen in recent\r\nweeks — permanent members make decisions with\r\nregard to questions that are of key importance to the\r\ninternational community and the future of the United\r\nNations.\r\nNine years after the establishment of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on reform of the Council, very\r\nlittle progress has been made on the key issues of such\r\nreform. Today, the membership of the Security Council\r\nrepresents scarcely 8 per cent of the total number of\r\nStates Members of the Organization, which has\r\nincreased almost fourfold since 1945.\r\nHow can the Security Council fulfil its\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security without appropriate representation\r\nwithin that body of two thirds of the world’s population\r\nliving in the developing countries?\r\nIt is inexplicable that Africa does not have a\r\nsingle representative among the permanent members of\r\nthe Council, given that most of the items on the\r\nCouncil’s agenda relate to conflicts on that continent,\r\nand that there are no permanent members from such a\r\nturbulent region as the Middle East.\r\nWith a view to rectifying the inadequate level of\r\nrepresentation of developing countries, we should\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nensure the inclusion as permanent members, with the\r\nsame privileges as the current permanent members, of\r\nat least two countries from Africa and two from Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, as well as two developing\r\ncountries from Asia.\r\nThe anachronistic privilege of the veto should be\r\ndone away with. No one can seriously argue that the\r\nalmost 300 times that the veto has been used was in the\r\ninterests of the international community, to say nothing\r\nof the even greater number of so-called silent vetoes or\r\nthreats of veto, which have frequently determined the\r\ncourse of action in meetings behind closed doors.\r\nWe cannot expect real leadership from a body\r\nsome of whose permanent members, sheltering behind\r\nthe veto privilege, practise on a daily basis double\r\nstandards and selective policies that give priority to\r\nnarrow national interests instead of to the aspirations of\r\nthe international community.\r\nIf the use of the veto is not restricted at least to\r\nactions under Chapter VII of the Charter, before being\r\nfinally eliminated; if we do not do away with the\r\npractice of so-called informal consultations by re-\r\nestablishing open meetings as the main way of holding\r\ndiscussions and taking decisions; if the provisional\r\nrules of procedure are not given final shape; if the\r\nopinions of non-members of the Council are not\r\nproperly taken into account; if there is no transparency\r\nand democracy; and if we do not put an end to\r\nhegemony, there will be no true reform of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nI should like to conclude by expressing our\r\nsincere congratulations to all the countries that have\r\nbeen elected as members of the Security Council for\r\nnext year, and to wish them every success in their\r\nimportant work.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI should like at the outset to express my gratitude for\r\nthe decision to convene this joint debate on two items\r\nof great interest to Members of the United Nations. As\r\nwe all know, the question of Security Council reform\r\ninvolves more than a mere increase in membership, and\r\nis directly related to the working methods of that body\r\nand its methods of reporting to the General Assembly,\r\nincluding the annual report on its work, which is\r\ncurrently before us.\r\nWe therefore thank Ambassador Martin Belinga-\r\nEboutou, Permanent Representative of Cameroon and\r\nPresident of the Security Council for this month, for\r\nintroducing the annual report of the Security Council.\r\nFor the first time, the report includes an analytical\r\nsection on the work of the Council containing elements\r\nof interest to all States Members of the United Nations.\r\nThis year, the members of the Security Council agreed\r\non guidelines regarding the preparation of the annual\r\nreport. This is an innovation. We believe that the\r\nformat has been improved, but the report is still far\r\nfrom being the substantive, useful document required\r\nby Member States if they are to evaluate the work of\r\nthat body. Mexico will try to ensure that in future the\r\nanalytical section of the report includes progress\r\nindicators regarding the work of the Council, as well as\r\na section containing proposals for the improvement of\r\nits work.\r\nIn recent years, a significant number of the\r\nmembers of the Security Council have tried to improve\r\nits interaction with all Members of the United Nations,\r\nas well as to enhance the transparency of that body. In\r\norder to limit the confidential nature of the Council’s\r\nwork, they are improving the dissemination of\r\ninformation regarding its activities and promoting more\r\ninformative public meetings so as to enable non-\r\nmembers of the Council to gain access to the\r\ninformation that the Secretariat provides on various\r\nsubjects and to offer their opinions. That would make it\r\npossible for them to offer their opinions regarding the\r\nCouncil’s decisions. The dissemination of information\r\nthrough statements to the press, informational\r\ndocuments and the Internet, as well as greater\r\ninteraction between some members of the Security\r\nCouncil and the members of the General Assembly,\r\nhave contributed to enhancing the Council’s\r\ntransparency.\r\nMexico, in the context of its work in the Security\r\nCouncil since January 2002 as a non-permanent\r\nmember, has promoted greater transparency in the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council, as well as\r\ngreater democratization in its decision-making process.\r\nMexico has thereby endeavoured to abide by the\r\nprovisions of article 48 of the provisional rules of\r\nprocedure, which states that the Council shall meet in\r\npublic. We hope that the resistance to change shown by\r\nsome members of the Council is easing and that this\r\nwill lead to a greater rapprochement between the\r\nmembers of this body and of the General Assembly.\r\nWrap-up meetings of the Security Council, at\r\nwhich there is an interactive dialogue between\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nmembers and non-members of the Council, are further\r\nproof of increased openness. This has been supported\r\nby some countries, but others who do not believe in the\r\nusefulness or the validity of such meetings continue to\r\nhave reservations on the subject. For this reason, these\r\nmeetings have not been held as regularly as my\r\ndelegation would have wished.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour appreciation to the Secretariat, whose contribution\r\nmade possible the publication in June 2002 of a\r\ndocument regarding procedural developments in the\r\nSecurity Council in 2001, and of an index to notes and\r\nstatements by the President of the Security Council\r\nrelating to documentation and procedure. Mexico will\r\nwork to ensure the institutionalization of the rules and\r\nworking methods, which have been provisional for\r\nmore than 50 years.\r\nIn connection with the subject of working\r\nmethods, the work of the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council is\r\ncontributing to the elaboration of measures to enhance\r\nthe methods of work of the Council. This is one of the\r\nkey aspects of the reform package.\r\nIn recent years, it has been noted that the\r\npositions of a large majority of delegations in the\r\nWorking Group have led to major improvements in the\r\nworking methods of the Council. These improvements\r\nhave been the result of initiatives by non-permanent\r\nmembers wishing to be in the vanguard of change.\r\nAs regards the Council’s decision-making\r\nprocess, the Working Group has stated, as have the\r\nmajority of delegations, that the use of the veto\r\nprivilege should be limited to decisions taken under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter. We hope that we will have\r\nthe support of all permanent members of the Council in\r\nthis connection.\r\nAs we all know, with respect to so-called cluster I\r\nitems, which relate to an increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council, the Working Group has before it\r\na broad range of proposals. The formulas proposed\r\nvary with respect to the number of new members and\r\nthe categories of new members. Mexico has made a\r\nconstructive contribution to this process. We are in\r\nfavour of an increase in the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers, which would also lead to better geographical\r\nrepresentation.\r\nDiscussions on this aspect of reform have been\r\nintensive and prolonged, but not very successful. This\r\nis due primarily to the fact that the numerous positions\r\nthat have been taken regarding the increase in\r\nmembership are very varied, and, in the majority of the\r\ncases, irreconcilable.\r\nMember States are convinced that there is a need\r\nto agree on a broad reform in the Security Council and\r\nhave been working very hard towards that end. Like the\r\nmajority of States, the Government of Mexico believes\r\nthat any decision regarding the reform must be\r\ncomprehensive and address the issues of an increase in\r\nmembership, the decision-making process, the question\r\nof the veto and an improvement in the working\r\nmethods of the Council.\r\nIn the quest to achieve this goal, we must bear in\r\nmind the following questions.\r\nFirst, rapid or partial solutions, or the\r\nestablishment of deadlines or set periods for reaching\r\nagreement, must be avoided.\r\nSecondly, the goal of the reform is for the\r\nCouncil to become more representative, transparent\r\nand democratic. It must be capable of dealing with the\r\nchallenges of our era.\r\nThirdly, any reform whose primary goal would be\r\nto increase the number of permanent members would\r\nonly exacerbate inequalities and enlarge the\r\nmembership of the “club of the privileged”, currently\r\nmade up of five members.\r\nFourthly, in assigning new seats, new realities\r\nmust be borne in mind, including the consolidation of\r\nthe European Union, which is an important protagonist\r\nin the international arena; the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution; and the fact that it is\r\nunjustifiable to give special privileges to even more\r\ncountries.\r\nFifthly, the real use of the veto and the so-called\r\n“hidden” use of the veto by permanent members in\r\nmost cases has a negative impact on the decision-\r\nmaking process in the Council. The restriction or\r\nelimination of this anachronistic privilege must be\r\nfirmly and decisively promoted.\r\nNegotiations in the Working Group are at an\r\nimpasse. Nine years of work in the Group have shown\r\nthat the reform of the Security Council is a highly\r\nsensitive subject politically, and for that reason only a\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nplan leading to a general agreement, as requested by\r\nthe General Assembly in resolution 48/26, would be\r\nlegitimate. The reform of the Council must lead to\r\ngreater representativity of the various regions as well\r\nas to changes in its working methods, including, as I\r\nsaid earlier, the limitation or elimination of the veto\r\nprivilege. The veto must no longer be something that is\r\nuntouchable.\r\nIt is a fact that the pace of negotiations in the\r\nWorking Group is far from ideal. It must be made clear,\r\nhowever, that this is due to the positions taken and the\r\ncomplexity of the subject material and not to the\r\nGroup’s methods of work. The Working Group is, and\r\nmust continue to be, the appropriate forum for\r\nnegotiations to achieve an overall reform, in keeping\r\nwith the General Assembly’s mandate. To disband the\r\nGroup would set a dangerous precedent: it would mean\r\nignoring not only the work that has already done but\r\nalso its importance as a representative and democratic\r\nbody of the General Assembly in which participation\r\nby all States Members of the United Nations is\r\nguaranteed.\r\nWe believe that one way of advancing the\r\nGroup’s work would be to agree to work on the\r\nincrease in non-permanent membership in order to\r\nencourage negotiation on the package of reforms and to\r\nenable agreements to be reached on the various\r\nelements of the package.\r\nThe Working Group has sought to find\r\nimaginative and innovative formulas for expansion that\r\nwould lead to an increase in membership, taking into\r\naccount the increase that has occurred in the\r\nmembership of the Organization as a whole. This\r\nwould ensure greater representativeness in the Council\r\nand greater legitimacy for its decisions.\r\nHowever, in this exercise we must not ignore the\r\nfact that Article 23 of the Charter clearly defines the\r\ncriteria for the election of Council members. On that\r\nbasis, the Working Group must make a greater effort to\r\ndetermine the membership profile of an expanded\r\nCouncil and should not focus solely on mathematical\r\nformulas, the contents of which might be subjective.\r\nFrom this perspective, we also believe that the work of\r\nthe Working Group will be incomplete if we do not\r\nknow the opinions of the five permanent members of\r\nthe Council, since they hold the power of veto over any\r\nreform and over the terms that they are willing to\r\naccept if membership is to increase.\r\nWe are confident that the Assembly will\r\nappreciate the work of the Group next year to advance\r\nthe negotiations on comprehensive Security Council\r\nreform, in which all States Members of the United\r\nNations will participate.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like, on behalf of the\r\ndelegation of Mexico, to join others who have\r\nexpressed condolences for the victims of the terrorist\r\nattack in Bali.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): I should\r\nlike to begin by thanking the President of the Security\r\nCouncil for October, Ambassador Belinga-Eboutou of\r\nCameroon, for his detailed introduction of the\r\nCouncil’s report, submitted to the General Assembly in\r\naccordance with the relevant provisions of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nOn behalf of Algeria, I also take this opportunity\r\nonce again to congratulate Angola, Chile, Germany,\r\nPakistan and Spain on their election as non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council. I am convinced that\r\nthose countries will not fail to make a constructive\r\ncontribution to the Council’s work.\r\nConsideration of the Security Council’s report is\r\nthe major mechanism whereby the General Assembly,\r\nunder paragraph 3 of Article 24 of our Organization’s\r\nCharter, evaluates action by the Security Council\r\nthroughout the period covered by the report. Thus, the\r\nexercise in which we are engaging today should be not\r\na mere formality, but a precious opportunity for our\r\nAssembly to consider the Council’s activities in depth\r\nand to identify measures to be taken to improve its\r\nworking methods. Such interaction is, indeed, in the\r\ninterests of the Council itself, which should exploit it\r\nby co-opting and making appropriate use of the ideas\r\nand innovative and constructive proposals which, I am\r\nsure, this debate cannot fail to generate. Following this\r\ndebate, the Assembly could take any action it may\r\ndeem necessary, as is its prerogative.\r\nWith regard to the format of the document before\r\nus, I pay particular tribute to my friend Ambassador\r\nMahbubani and the entire team from the Singapore\r\nmission for their efforts to give the report its current\r\nformat, in response largely to the comments and\r\ncriticisms made by Member States on the debate we\r\nheld here on this subject last year. The brief, analytical\r\nand precise document before us today is indeed a\r\nconsiderable improvement over the reports of\r\npreceding years. It is considerably shorter, which has\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\npermitted substantial savings for the Organization and\r\nfacilitated our reading and understanding.\r\nAs to the functioning of the Council, we note\r\nthat, during the period under consideration, the Council\r\nheld a greater number of public meetings, in which a\r\ngreater number of States participated. We also note a\r\nnet increase in public briefings organized by the\r\nSecretariat, allowing non-member States to be better\r\ninformed on the development of certain issues dealt\r\nwith by that body. Algeria nevertheless believes that it\r\nwould be appropriate for the consultations following\r\nthose meetings to be open on a systematic basis to\r\nparties interested or concerned with a view to hearing\r\ntheir opinions. This would give the Council a better\r\nunderstanding of subjects and thus help it take more\r\ninformed decisions.\r\nWe would also note our conviction that the wrap-\r\nup meetings, open to non-members following the work\r\nof the Council at the end of each month, offer an\r\nopportunity for views to be expressed on subjects of\r\ninterest in an analytical, synthetic, candid and open\r\nmanner. We believe that this practice should be\r\nmaintained and encouraged.\r\nWith regard to substance, the Security Council’s\r\nreport shows that, over the period under\r\nconsideration — June 2001 to July 2002 — the Council\r\nnot only reacted to threats to international and regional\r\npeace and security, but also acted directly in addressing\r\na large number of problems affecting the world.\r\nFollowing the attacks of 11 September 2001, it firmly\r\nand promptly addressed the global threat of terrorism\r\nby adopting resolutions 1363 (2001), 1368 (2001) and\r\n1373 (2001). It also showed resolve and pugnacity in\r\ndealing with the issues of Afghanistan, Kosovo, East\r\nTimor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea,\r\nAngola and Burundi.\r\nIn our view, the Security Council missions to\r\nvarious conflict zones or to post-conflict areas were\r\nvery useful in going to the very heart of the problem\r\nand in seeking the support and cooperation of the\r\nparties concerned. In the Great Lakes region as in\r\nEthiopia/Eritrea, these missions had a positive impact\r\non local actors. In the light of such success, we\r\nencourage this type of initiative and action and call for\r\nthem to be formalized and extended to other conflict\r\nareas.\r\nHowever, we regret to note that, in some cases,\r\nthe Council has been hesitant to deal with certain\r\nissues with the same political will and has not shown\r\nthe same resolve. More serious yet, we have even noted\r\nan implicit sanctioning of non-respect of resolutions by\r\ncertain Members, which has seriously undermined the\r\nCouncil’s authority. We regret in this respect that\r\ncertain important Council resolutions have remained\r\ndead letter and not been followed up. This situation has\r\noften encouraged the recalcitrant party to a conflict or\r\nany given situation to continue to defy the Council’s\r\nwishes and to undermine its credibility.\r\nIn the Middle East, where the Council has a\r\nmanifest responsibility, it has been unable, despite the\r\nadoption of numerous resolutions, to make any\r\nsignificant progress in encouraging or facilitating the\r\npeace process or, indeed, in protecting the Palestinian\r\npopulation in the occupied territories. The case of\r\nresolution 1435 (2002), which was painstakingly\r\nnegotiated and adopted just two weeks ago, attests to\r\nthe Council’s powerlessness to ensure respect for its\r\nown resolutions. As soon as the text was adopted,\r\nIsrael effectively rejected it and declared, in all\r\nimpunity and with its customary arrogance towards the\r\ninternational community, that it would not take it into\r\nconsideration.\r\nIt is therefore the credibility of the Security\r\nCouncil itself that is at stake. This will be further\r\neroded, if the Council does not manage to reverse the\r\ntrend and show the whole world that it is capable of\r\nassuming its responsibilities in managing and solving\r\nthe various conflicts that have been on its agenda for a\r\nlong time. The Council should therefore have a\r\ncomprehensive policy based on equity and justice. It\r\nshould adopt a clear and coherent approach to dealing\r\nwith the issues entrusted to it by the Charter,\r\nparticularly those related to international peace and\r\nsecurity. In other words, there is a need for deep-rooted\r\nreform.\r\nIt is not just a matter of abstract theory to say that\r\nour Organization unfortunately continues to be caught\r\nup in the criteria of, and subscribe to, the logic of an\r\nagelong gone, despite the fact that the world order\r\nestablished by the Second World War has undergone\r\nserious changes, not only in terms of geopolitical\r\nstructure but also because of the major changes that\r\nhave taken place in inter-State relations. In the wake of\r\nthe upheavals in international relations, nine years ago\r\nthe General Assembly placed the question of the\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nreform of the Security Council on its agenda and\r\nestablished an Open-ended Working Group to consider\r\nall aspects of that issue, with a view to strengthening\r\nthe Council’s effectiveness and reforming its working\r\nmethods.\r\nWhile the Working Group has made some\r\nprogress with regard to addressing issues pertaining to\r\nthe Council’s methods of work, the Group continues to\r\nexperience great difficulty as a result of major\r\ndifferences of opinion with regard to reaching a\r\nconsensus on the more substantial issues, in particular\r\nin connection with Council expansion and the use of\r\nthe veto. It should be noted that the lack of progress, or\r\nindeed the blockage, on substantive issues is\r\nessentially due to the lack of political will on the part\r\nof various countries that have raised further obstacles\r\nand pretexts to delay, or even prevent, the emergence\r\nof the desired consensus. Proposals and suggestions\r\ndesigned to convince us to give up the ambition of full\r\nand comprehensive reform or to try to get us to be\r\nsatisfied with partial reform for the time being have\r\nbeen advanced at various times. Should we give in to\r\npessimism and accept the status quo or should we\r\nredouble our efforts to bring about genuine reform in\r\nboth the Security Council, so it can better fulfil its\r\nmandate, and the General Assembly, so that it may re-\r\nassume its prerogatives as the principal representative\r\ndeliberative body of the United Nations?\r\nMy delegation is well aware of the fact that we\r\nshould not prolong discussions indefinitely on such an\r\nimportant and sensitive issue. We believe that giving\r\nup the momentous and noble undertaking of completely\r\nreforming the Council would mean a sort of abdication\r\nin the face of the difficult nature of the task. We should\r\ninstead continue our efforts with perseverance and\r\ndetermination to arrive at an acceptable solution that\r\nwill not compromise the prospects for comprehensive\r\nreform.\r\nWith regard to improving the functioning and\r\nworking methods of the Council, my delegation is\r\npleased to note the increasingly active role of the\r\nCouncil in the prevention and resolution of\r\ninternational crises and conflicts. We also note with\r\nsatisfaction the introduction by the Council of positive\r\nmeasures aimed at creating greater transparency in its\r\nwork, particularly by opening its briefings by the\r\nSecretariat to all Member States. However, we believe\r\nthat it is necessary for the Council to finally take a\r\ndecision regarding its rules of procedure and to\r\ninstitutionalize arrangements regarding a number of\r\nmeasures already taken to improve its working\r\nmethods and transparency, so that the positive changes\r\nare not subject to the goodwill of any particular\r\nPresident or member of the Council.\r\nDespite the increasing number of public meetings\r\nheld by the Council, which we believe in fact increase\r\nits effectiveness, we note with regret that closed\r\nmeetings, in which all important issues are dealt with\r\nand during which decisions affecting Member States\r\nare taken, remain the customary practice. In fact,\r\nclosed meetings should be held on an exceptional basis.\r\nWe also note that those who exercise exorbitant veto\r\npower determine the final outcome of the Council’s\r\ndeliberations in advance among them.\r\nMy delegation also believes that it is necessary\r\nfor the Council to consult on a regular and continuous\r\nbasis with the States and regional and subregional\r\norganizations directly or indirectly concerned by the\r\nsituations discussed by the Council. In this regard, the\r\nSecurity Council should take steps to more effectively\r\nimplement Article 50 of the Charter, concerning the\r\nright of every State to consult the Council if it faces\r\ndifficulty in the implementation of preventive or\r\ncoercive measures ordered by the Council. Similarly,\r\nand in addition to the new spirit of partnership and\r\ncooperation, further efforts should also be made with\r\nregard to troop-contributing countries in order to\r\ninvolve them in drawing up the mandate for the forces\r\ndispatched by the United Nations.\r\nThe Gordian knot of our exercise, which for my\r\ndelegation is a greater source of concern and\r\nfrustration, is the total lack of progress on substantive\r\nissues. Whether with regard to the size or composition\r\nof the Council, the criteria for the selection of new\r\npermanent members or even the issue of the veto, to\r\nmention just a few issues, the gap separating the\r\npositions of different countries, far from converging\r\nupon desirable compromises, has in fact grown and\r\nbecome more pronounced, with each State maintaining\r\nits own position and no one demonstrating any\r\nwillingness to give in or be flexible.\r\nOn the issue of the veto, my delegation believes\r\nthat this matter is intrinsically linked to the question of\r\nenlargement, whose consideration is at the very heart\r\nof the issue of Council reform. My delegation fully\r\nsupports the idea advanced by almost all delegations\r\nthat the right of veto is anachronistic, discriminatory\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nand anti-democratic. We would therefore like to see\r\nprogressive restriction of this privilege, which should\r\nbe limited solely to matters falling under Chapter VII\r\nof the Charter, until such time as it is eliminated. Until\r\nthis privilege of a by-gone era is better regulated and\r\neventually abolished, we would hope — although we\r\ndo not harbour many illusions — that, in the face of\r\nurgent pressure from the rest of the world, those who\r\nhold the power of the veto will demonstrate\r\npragmatism and utilize the veto only in exceptional\r\ncircumstances.\r\nWith regard to the expansion of the Council, we\r\nbelieve that it is urgent and necessary to correct the\r\ncurrent imbalance by ensuring more balanced and\r\nequitable geo-political representation and by\r\nstrengthening the participation of developing countries.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation would like to\r\nreiterate its support for the specific proposals made by\r\nthe member States of the Non-Aligned Movement,\r\nparticularly those concerning an increase in the number\r\nof Council members. The proposals of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement all demonstrate the wish to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness and representative\r\ncharacter of this important body.\r\nIn addition, my delegation would like to highlight\r\nthe fact that any enlargement in the composition of the\r\nCouncil should take into consideration the desire\r\nexpressed by Africa at the Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) Summit held in Harare in 1997. In\r\naccordance with that position, the Council should be\r\nenlarged by 11 seats. As a matter of fairness, and given\r\nthat Africa is the Council’s main priority and that the\r\ncontinent is home to the largest number of Member\r\nStates in the Organization, Africa should be given two\r\npermanent rotating seats having the same privileges as\r\nother permanent members and two non-permanent seats\r\nto be shared in accordance with the OAU criteria and\r\nany future new elements or refinements to be made to\r\nthose criteria. We consider that an increase in the\r\nmembership of the Council to at least 26 members\r\nwould give the Council greater legitimacy,\r\nrepresentation and credibility without reducing its\r\neffectiveness in any way.\r\nMr. Schumacher (Germany): I would like to\r\nbegin by thanking all delegations for their strong\r\nsupport for Germany in the elections to the Security\r\nCouncil. We take this as an overwhelming vote of\r\nconfidence for German foreign and United Nations\r\npolicy. Let me assure you once again that our\r\nmembership on the Council will be guided by the\r\nprinciples of transparency, accountability and\r\nreconciliation of interests.\r\nGermany welcomes the progress achieved in\r\nstreamlining the Security Council’s annual report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The report before us is the result of\r\na considerable effort undertaken in the Security\r\nCouncil Working Group on Documentation and\r\nProcedures. The cost of the annual report was\r\nsignificantly reduced, which in itself is an important\r\nachievement in times of overall budgetary constraints.\r\nMost importantly, the report offers a more analytical\r\nintroduction, highlighting areas where the Council\r\nneeds to remain engaged and where its decisions\r\nremain to be implemented. We encourage the Security\r\nCouncil to continue to pursue that approach in its\r\nfuture reports. The degree to which the Security\r\nCouncil has become more operational and effective in\r\nits approach to questions of international peace and\r\nstability needs to be positively highlighted. As a future\r\nmember of the Council we will contribute to those\r\nendeavours.\r\nOn Security Council reform, I am afraid I can be\r\nrather brief. Our position is well known. In this year’s\r\ngeneral debate, we heard a great number of delegations\r\nreiterate their feeling that the composition of the\r\nCouncil no longer reflects the realities of today. It is an\r\noverwhelming perception here and outside this Hall, in\r\nthe academic and the political world, that this Security\r\nCouncil no longer reflects the new geopolitical order of\r\nthe world. It lacks legitimacy. We fully share that view.\r\nKishore Mahbubani of Singapore had a much\r\nnicer image of a moving train which he jumped on and\r\nwill have to jump off in two months’ time. I hope that\r\nthis train will stop to reconsider its schedule, together\r\nwith the railway company. That company is, as I\r\nunderstand it, the Members of the United Nations and\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nAt the beginning of this session of the General\r\nAssembly, we admitted two new Members to the\r\nUnited Nations. That very happy occasion highlighted\r\nonce again how rapidly United Nations membership\r\nhas grown over the past 57 years. Membership during\r\nthat period has almost quadrupled. Neither the changes\r\nin contributions to peace and security nor the\r\nincreasing stake of all regions of the world in\r\ninternational affairs is presently reflected adequately in\r\nthe composition of the Council. We reiterate our belief\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nthat this has to change if the United Nations system as\r\na whole wishes to maintain and increase its authority.\r\nGermany therefore supports an increase in the\r\nnumber of seats in both categories, a review process to\r\nassess that reform after a given period of time, a first\r\nstep towards a veto reform as suggested by Foreign\r\nMinister Fischer, and further progress in reforming the\r\nCouncil’s working methods, a process which has\r\nalready gained very positive momentum.\r\nWe can only warn against proposals apparently\r\naiming at interim solutions, such as increasing only the\r\nnumber of non-permanent seats and thereby restricting\r\nthe great regions of Africa, Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean — and to a certain extent even Asia — to\r\nnon-permanent seats forever. Interim solutions are\r\nmakeshift solutions, and makeshift solutions are bad\r\nsolutions. They run counter to the expressed will of our\r\nheads of State and Government in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration: “to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects”.\r\nWhile we understand the desire to breathe life\r\ninto a rather deadlocked reform debate, we believe that\r\nheading in the wrong direction would, in the end, only\r\ncement forever the present state of affairs. Germany\r\nwould, therefore, not be able to support such a\r\nproposal.\r\nWe continue to believe that narrowing and\r\nconsolidating the various reform options contained in\r\nthe report of the Open-ended Working Group might be\r\na first step towards embarking on a meaningful\r\nSecurity Council reform. In addition, the question\r\nshould be raised of whether, after ten years of work,\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group has not exhausted its\r\nmeans and strength and should receive a new, more\r\nfocused political impetus and mandate from the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAs have all other delegations, we would like to express\r\nour shock at the bombing incident in Bali resulting in\r\nnumerous deaths and casualties among innocent\r\npeople. We strongly condemn those acts, and we wish\r\nto extend our condolences to the Government of\r\nIndonesia and to the families of all those killed or\r\ninjured in the incident.\r\nAllow me to express my appreciation to the Chair\r\nof the Working Group on Council reform established\r\nduring the last session of the General Assembly,\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo, and the two Vice-Chairpersons,\r\nAmbassador Ingolfsson and Ambassador Durrant, for\r\ntheir tireless efforts to ensure the smooth functioning\r\nof the work of the Working Group. We believe that the\r\nnewly elected Chair of the Working Group will\r\ncertainly guide the work to a positive conclusion. We\r\nwould also like to thank the Ambassador of Cameroon\r\nfor his presentation of the annual report of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has already expressed its\r\nviews on the annual report. I wish to stress that this\r\nyear’s annual report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly makes use of a new format that\r\nhighlights the main points and reduces the report’s\r\nvolume. That is in keeping with the demands and\r\ndesires of the Member States. It is also a result of the\r\ncooperative efforts of the Council members.\r\nIn the past year, the working method of the\r\nSecurity Council has been improved through increased\r\ntransparency and enhanced efficiency. That momentum\r\nmust be maintained. In the past year, the Security\r\nCouncil, as the primary organ for maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security, has adapted to\r\nsituations, given prompt consideration to major issues\r\nand taken actions at the right time. In particular, after\r\nthe terrorist acts of 11 September, the Security Council\r\nswiftly passed resolution 1373 (2001) and established\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee, thus providing an\r\nindispensable avenue for international cooperation on\r\ncounter-terrorism.\r\nAt this critical moment, when major changes are\r\ntaking place in Afghanistan, the Security Council has\r\nto act in solidarity for important decisions, in playing\r\nthe major role towards full implementation of the Bonn\r\nAgreement and for the elimination of the Taliban and\r\nthe Al Qaeda base.\r\nMoved by the Security Council, and with the\r\neffort of all sides, positive changes have taken place in\r\nsome of the areas of conflict in Africa. However, the\r\nwork of the Council is still far from meeting the\r\naspirations of the African countries. The Council\r\nshould grasp the right time to work harder and give\r\npositive support to the African Union and other\r\nregional organizations to work for concrete results in\r\nthe resolution of disputes in Africa.\r\nAt the same time, we would like to point out that\r\nthe role played by the Security Council in the Middle\r\nEast on the Palestinian question is still not satisfactory,\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\ndespite the fact that the Council has adopted\r\nresolutions and declarations. Nevertheless, the situation\r\nin the Middle East has not improved.\r\nFurthermore, the security situation in Afghanistan\r\nis still a matter of concern. This remains an issue that\r\nthe Security Council must face.\r\nIn the final analysis, the major issue of\r\ninternational peace and security — how and when the\r\nSecurity Council should effectively assume the role\r\nand responsibilities entrusted to it by the United\r\nNations Charter — is still an issue that deserves our\r\ndeep and continuing consideration.\r\nAllow me now to make some observations on the\r\nreform of the Security Council. In the more than 50\r\nyears since its inception, the number of Members of the\r\nOrganization have grown from 51 to 191, the majority\r\nbeing developing countries. As humankind steps into\r\nthe twenty-first century, the challenges it faces have\r\nbecome ever more complex. While undertaking the\r\nsacred mission of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, adapting to new situations to better meet new\r\nchallenges, the Council should keep pace with the\r\nprogress of time and carry out appropriate and\r\nnecessary reforms.\r\nThe primary task of reform should be to redress\r\nthe lack of balance in the Council’s present\r\ncomposition, so that representation of the developing\r\ncountries could be increased on a priority basis, in\r\naccordance with the principle of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution. This is the aspiration of many Member\r\nStates, as well as the common understanding of the\r\nmajority of Member States.\r\nImproving the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil is an important part of its reform. The Council\r\nhas our support in its efforts to improve its working\r\nmethods, to increase the participation of non-members\r\nand to enhance transparency, while ensuring its\r\nefficiency and authority.\r\nIn recent years, the Council has made significant\r\nefforts, with widely recognized results. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change”, states that\r\n“The Security Council has significantly\r\nimproved its working methods over the past few\r\nyears ... The Council has become more\r\ntransparent, offering greater opportunities for the\r\nwider membership of the United Nations to\r\nparticipate in its work. There has been an\r\nincreased number of open meetings with\r\nparticipation by non-members of the Security\r\nCouncil, briefings for the wider membership of\r\nthe Organization, and improved arrangements for\r\nconsultations with troop-contributing countries”.\r\n(A/57/387, para. 21)\r\nOur delegation believes that, with the common effort of\r\nMember States, more progress will be made in this\r\nrespect by the Council.\r\nThe reform of the Council affects the direct\r\ninterests of all States. The complexity of contradicting\r\ninterests requires a gradual process of reaching a broad\r\nconsensus, based on serious study and in-depth\r\ndeliberations. There cannot be any ‘quick fix’. In\r\ndealing with this important issue, it is necessary for us\r\nto have not only a sense of urgency but also, and even\r\nmore so, patience and wisdom. At present, the Open-\r\nended Working Group remains the appropriate forum\r\nfor this discussion.\r\nChina is prepared to participate actively in the\r\ndiscussion on Security Council reform and to work\r\nwith all others for the further enhancement of the role\r\nof the Council, so that it can better assume its\r\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, entrusted to it by the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nMr. Jacob (Israel): At the outset I would like to\r\nextend our deepest condolences to the Government and\r\npeople of Indonesia, and to the victims and their\r\nfamilies for the heinous terrorist attack that was\r\nperpetrated on the island of Bali last Saturday. We offer\r\nspecial condolences to the Government and people of\r\nAustralia, who have sustained the largest number of\r\ndeaths and injuries. As a people and a country which\r\nhas been targeted by terrorism for so many years, we\r\nshare the pain and agony of those who were affected by\r\nthis latest manifestation of international terrorism.\r\nThe State of Israel joins with other Member\r\nStates in support of reform of the Security Council,\r\nboth in its structure and its working methods, with a\r\nview to more equitable representation and greater\r\ntransparency that would increase the effectiveness and\r\ncredibility of this body.\r\nThe past 57 years have shown that the world\r\nchanges, often at an incredible pace, but that the\r\nwheels of change revolve much more slowly inside\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nthese halls. Since the last expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil in 1965, more than 70 new States have become\r\nMember States of the United Nations; the global\r\nstructure has been drastically transformed; and the\r\nagenda of the international community is far different\r\nfrom that envisaged by the authors of the Charter.\r\nAll these changes, when taken together, have\r\ninfluenced the Security Council’s capability to fulfil its\r\nprimary responsibility to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The end of the cold\r\nwar, the advances made in the field of decolonization,\r\nand the challenges of globalization have all contributed\r\ntowards the advancement of humanity as a whole. At\r\nthe same time, new threats and unseen enemies, such as\r\ninternational terrorism, rampant disease and increasing\r\ndisparity between the developed and the developing\r\ncountries, pose a new sort of challenge to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe United Nations must adapt itself to these new\r\nrealities, and, in the process, the Security Council must\r\nchange as well. At the same time, we must exercise\r\ngreat care to maintain the effectiveness of the Council.\r\nIsrael believes that expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil is important, in light of the marked increase in\r\nmembership in the United Nations, and in order to\r\nmore faithfully reflect the vast multiplicity of interests\r\nof Member States. What is needed, however, is to\r\nstrike a proper balance between ensuring that the\r\nCouncil reflects the larger will of the Organization and\r\nthe need to preserve the Council’s ability to meet its\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter.\r\nIsrael further believes that improved access to\r\nCouncil proceedings can only serve the interests of the\r\nOrganization. Greater reliance on open meetings and\r\nmore efficient and reliable methods of conveying\r\ninformation to Member States will undoubtedly\r\nincrease transparency and confidence in the work of\r\nthe Council. This will not only bring Member States\r\ncloser to the work of the Council, but also provide\r\ngreater understanding for the Council’s decisions\r\namong the international community as a whole.\r\nIsrael supports such change insofar as it will\r\nadvance the Organization towards the ultimate goal of\r\nincreased efficiency and effectiveness. Such change\r\nmust therefore reflect general agreement among\r\nMember States so as to foster cooperation rather than\r\nincrease divisiveness.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my\r\ndelegation’s belief that the key to greater credibility\r\nand effectiveness lies in the Council’s ability to\r\nembody the broadest range of cultures and opinions\r\nwhile retaining its ability to function coherently and\r\neffectively.\r\nMr. Tayeb (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic):\r\nAllow me first of all, in the context of the\r\nconsideration of the report on the work of the Security\r\nCouncil submitted to the Assembly, to pay tribute to\r\nthe Council for its efforts last year to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nLikewise, we would like to affirm the crucial\r\nimportance we attach to the fact that the Security\r\nCouncil is fully discharging its mandate and playing its\r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity in an effective manner throughout the world.\r\nIndeed, we believe that we cannot dissociate the active\r\nand effective role of the Security Council from the\r\nimplementation of the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and the re-establishment\r\nof peace and security throughout the world. The\r\nSecurity Council’s clear determination to preserve\r\ninternational peace and security is pivotal in the\r\nprocess of bringing about peace and prosperity\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the interest that the Security\r\nCouncil has shown in the question of the Middle East,\r\nas reflected in its adoption of four resolutions, most of\r\nthem unanimously, over the period under consideration.\r\nHowever, we must express our concern at the fact that\r\nmost of those resolutions have not been implemented,\r\nas the report itself shows.\r\nIndeed, the State of Israel has refused to\r\nimplement the resolutions calling for an immediate\r\nceasefire and for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from\r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories. Israel has\r\nprevented the deployment of a fact-finding team\r\nconcerning the atrocities perpetrated by the Israeli\r\nforces in the Jenin refugee camp. This refusal to\r\nimplement Security Council resolutions demonstrates\r\nonce again that State’s scorn for the decisions of the\r\nUnited Nations, the Security Council and the\r\ninternational community. This is a matter of great\r\nconcern in the context of international relations, as it\r\ncould undermine the Council’s work, effectiveness and\r\nlegitimacy.\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nIsrael’s persistent refusal to implement Security\r\nCouncil resolutions shows its determination to continue\r\noccupying Palestinian and other Arab territories and to\r\nundermine efforts towards peace in the Middle East.\r\nThe Arab side, for its part, has shown a sincere\r\ndetermination to establish peace. This was made clear\r\nin particular at the Arab Summit held in Beirut last\r\nMarch, which adopted the initiative put forward by His\r\nHighness Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz to establish\r\na comprehensive and just peace in accordance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973), and to make possible the signing of a peace\r\nagreement leading to Israel’s full withdrawal from\r\noccupied Palestinian and Arab territories; the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State, with\r\nAl-Quds as its capital; and the establishment of\r\npeaceful, normal relations between Israel and Arab\r\nStates.\r\nThe day after that decision was taken, Israel\r\nperpetrated the worst possible crimes and massacres\r\nagainst innocent, unarmed Palestinian civilians and\r\nbesieged the legitimate Palestinian Authority.\r\nGiven Israel’s failure to comply with the Security\r\nCouncil’s resolutions and efforts to promote peace in\r\nthe region, the international community must take the\r\nnecessary measures in order to maintain the prestige\r\nand credibility of the Council. Such action should have\r\nthe same weight and force as other measures taken by\r\nthe Council vis-à-vis other States that have failed to\r\ncomply with its resolutions. Israel must submit to the\r\nwill of the international community and accept the\r\nimplementation of the relevant decisions of the\r\nSecurity Council. This alone will be a guarantee of\r\npeace, security and stability in the Middle East.\r\nMy country has noted with great satisfaction the\r\nrole played by the Security Council in the\r\nstrengthening of stability and the settlement of\r\nconflicts in a number of regions of the world, including\r\nAfrica, the Balkans and Cyprus. The Kingdom of Saudi\r\nArabia fully supports the efforts undertaken by the\r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General to strengthen peace\r\nand security in those regions.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fully supports\r\ninternational efforts to combat terrorism, in accordance\r\nwith Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). My\r\ncountry will spare no effort in pursuing the perpetrators\r\nof such acts, as it believes that terrorism poses a threat\r\nto all humankind.\r\nHowever, in this respect we should make clear the\r\nfollowing points. First, terrorism is a global\r\nphenomenon that does not relate to any single nation,\r\nreligion or race. We should therefore not attribute it to\r\nany people or religion. Secondly, occupation by foreign\r\nforces is the worst form of terrorism and should be\r\neliminated just like other forms of terrorism. Thirdly,\r\nresistance against foreign occupation is a legitimate act\r\nunder international instruments and the relevant\r\ndecisions of the United Nations. Fourthly, in the\r\ncontext of the combat against terrorism, it is not\r\npermissible to strike against innocent peoples.\r\nWith regard to agenda item 40, concerning\r\nequitable representation in the Security Council and\r\nother related issues, my country’s delegation fully\r\nagrees with the Secretary-General’s report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration as\r\nconcerns the need for continual change, adaptation and\r\nlearning in the Organization, in order to ensure the\r\ncontinued importance of its role. No reform within this\r\nOrganization can be comprehensive and complete\r\nunless it involves the long-awaited expansion of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nGrowing appeals for reform in the functioning of\r\nthe United Nations, in particular of the Security\r\nCouncil, reflect the feelings of a number of Member\r\nStates. Indeed, we are still far from attaining the\r\npurposes set out in the Charter, and in particular the\r\nvery raison d’être whereby it was established, namely\r\nto preserve succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar and to promote peace, security, social development\r\nand prosperity for all.\r\nThe establishment in 1993 of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on reform of the Security Council\r\nreflected agreement among Member States on the need\r\nto increase the membership of the Council so as to\r\nensure equitable geographical representation and to\r\nenhance transparency of its activities. However, we\r\ndeplore the fact that so much time has elapsed without\r\nagreement being reached in the Working Group on\r\nseveral issues, including the number of new Council\r\nmembers, including permanent members, and the\r\nquestion of the veto.\r\nIn the context of reforming the Council’s working\r\nmethods and increasing its membership, several issues\r\nshould be taken into account. First, any reform effort\r\nshould seek to ensure that the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil and its ability to deal with threats to\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\ninternational peace and security are not put at risk.\r\nSecondly, the role of the Council should not be limited\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security\r\nbut should include conflict prevention and peace-\r\nbuilding in the aftermath of conflicts. Thirdly, all\r\nMember States throughout the world must comply with\r\nCouncil resolutions, without any selectivity. Fourthly,\r\nthe transparency of the Council’s working methods\r\nmust be increased.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I should like at the outset\r\nto express, on behalf of my Government, profound\r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of\r\nIndonesia, to Australia and to the other countries\r\nwhose nationals were lost, as well as to the bereaved\r\nfamilies of the victims of the terrorist bombing in Bali.\r\nWe condemn the bombing in the strongest terms, and\r\nexpress the hope that the perpetrator or perpetrators of\r\nthat heinous act will not escape punishment.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the clustering of the two\r\nitems under consideration in an effort to improve the\r\nefficiency of the work of the General Assembly. We\r\nalso wish to thank the President of the Security Council\r\nfor the month of October, Ambassador Martin Belinga-\r\nEboutou of Cameroon, for introducing the fifty-seventh\r\nannual report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly. We consider the annual reporting by the\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly on its work to be an\r\nimportant occasion for the larger membership of the\r\nOrganization in order to be better acquainted with the\r\nwork of the Council during the reporting period. It\r\nreinforces the institutional relationship between the\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, as provided for in\r\nArticles 15 and 24 of the Charter. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the Council’s decision to hold an open\r\nmeeting last month for the purpose of discussing the\r\nreport before submitting it to the General Assembly.\r\nThis reflects the seriousness with which the Council\r\nundertakes this annual reporting exercise, as well as the\r\nCouncil’s sense of accountability to the larger\r\nmembership of the Organization, in whose name it acts.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the new and improved\r\nformat of this year’s report, which reflects the\r\nCouncil’s willingness to improve its method of work\r\nand ensure that it evolves in response to the many\r\ncomments made by the larger membership over the\r\nyears. We welcome the attempt that has been made to\r\nprovide an analysis of the work of the Council during\r\nthe reporting period — an analysis which many\r\ndelegations had called for in the past. My delegation\r\ncommends Council members, including the delegations\r\nof Singapore, the United Kingdom and others, for their\r\nserious effort to improve the format and quality of the\r\nreport.\r\nWe look forward to further improvements in\r\nfuture reports, particularly in the analytical part, with\r\nthe inclusion of more details of Council decisions and\r\nactions, leading to a better understanding of the issues\r\ndealt with in the Council. The Council could, for\r\ninstance, enlighten the larger membership on\r\ncircumstances that have had an impact on its final\r\ndecision on a particular issue. A more detailed\r\ndescription of the public and private meetings of the\r\nCouncil — instead of a mere listing of such\r\nmeetings — would certainly be more helpful to the\r\nlarger membership. We consider the permanent web\r\nsite of the presidency of the Security Council to be\r\nextremely useful in enabling us to follow the work of\r\nthe Council.\r\nOn the substantive aspects of its work, it is clear\r\nthat there has been a tremendous increase in the\r\nworkload of the Council during the reporting period.\r\nAs in recent years, a major focus of the work of the\r\nCouncil was on Africa, which still demands the full\r\nattention of the Council. In this regard, we welcome\r\nthe establishment of the ad hoc working group on\r\nAfrica, under the chairmanship of Ambassador Koonjul\r\nof Mauritius. The Council can certainly claim its fair\r\nshare of the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize, which was\r\nawarded to the Secretary-General and the United\r\nNations as a whole for their contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe successful establishment of the Transitional\r\nAdministration in Afghanistan, peaceful elections in\r\nSierra Leone and the independence of Timor-Leste are\r\namong the outstanding achievements of the Council\r\nduring the period under review. We congratulate the\r\nCouncil, as well as the men and women from many\r\nnations who serve in United Nations missions, for their\r\ncontribution in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nHowever, my delegation is disappointed that on\r\nthe issue of the Middle East and Palestine, the Council\r\nhas not been able to play the role expected of it. We\r\nwelcome the fact that the Council has discussed the\r\nissue of Palestine with greater frequency, holding\r\nseveral open debates and regular monthly briefings on\r\nthe situation on the ground. We note that a total of 21\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nCouncil meetings were held on that question, and that\r\nfour resolutions were passed and two presidential\r\nstatements issued.\r\nUnfortunately, the increase in the number of\r\nmeetings on the subject did not have an impact on the\r\nsituation on the ground. Either Israel continued to\r\nignore or manipulate the Council’s resolutions or —\r\nmore often than not — the Council was not able to do\r\nanything meaningful because it was prevented from\r\ndoing so. We strongly believe that had the Council\r\napproved the establishment of a United Nations or\r\ninternational monitoring presence in the occupied\r\nterritories, much of the violence that has occurred\r\ncould have been avoided and the situation today would\r\nbe more conducive to a negotiated settlement.\r\nThe question of Palestine is one of the oldest\r\nitems on the agenda of the Council, yet resolving it has\r\nnot been possible. The failure of the Council to exert\r\nits authority on this issue undermines its credibility. It\r\nis time for the Council to play a more active role on\r\nthis issue and to contribute to the amelioration of the\r\nsituation on the ground.\r\nAnother issue on which the Council continues to\r\nbe at an impasse relates to the situation in Iraq. The\r\nunresolved question of Iraq’s alleged weapons of mass\r\ndestruction has stood in the way of the lifting of the\r\nsanctions imposed on that country. The matter is\r\ncurrently being actively discussed once again in the\r\nCouncil — or more accurately, among the Council’s\r\npermanent members. In dealing with this issue, the\r\nCouncil is facing one of the most difficult and critical\r\nmoments in its history. Upon its decision may hinge\r\nwar or peace; this is a decision that will affect not only\r\nthe people of Iraq, but also the entire international\r\ncommunity. Clearly, it is the hope and expectation of\r\nall peace-loving nations that the issue can be resolved\r\npeacefully through diplomacy rather than through\r\nmilitary action, as is being actively advocated in some\r\ncircles.\r\nOn an issue as important as this, it is imperative\r\nthat the views of all of the members of the Council be\r\nbrought to bear on its final decision. It is dismaying\r\nthat, at a time when the Council is opening itself up to\r\nthe larger membership through its open debates and\r\nbriefings, the 10 non-permanent, or, more accurately,\r\nthe 10 elected members of the Council continue to be\r\nkept in the dark, according to many of them, as the\r\npermanent members have engaged in private\r\nconsultations among themselves for the past several\r\nweeks.\r\nThe sidelining of the elected members of the\r\nCouncil is against the very spirit and letter of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. While it distinguishes between\r\nthe two categories of membership of the Council, the\r\nCharter does not otherwise discriminate between the\r\npermanent and non-permanent, or elected members,\r\neach of which is entitled to the same right to be\r\nconsulted on all issues before the Council, even if they\r\ndo not enjoy the right of veto.\r\nIn addressing the question of Iraq, the Council\r\nshould heed the words of the Secretary-General, who,\r\nin his statement to the General Assembly on 12\r\nSeptember 2002, urged us to rededicate ourselves to\r\nthe principles and purposes of this Organization and to\r\nthe centrality of the multilateral process. Equally\r\nresonant are the remarks made by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom, a permanent\r\nmember, at the Council’s open meeting on 26\r\nSeptember 2002, in discussing the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly, when he\r\nsaid that:\r\n“States cannot play a unilateral role in the modern\r\nworld, but they must play a role that adds power\r\nto the collective objectives of the United\r\nNations.” (See S/PV.4616)\r\nBoth of these statements are extremely pertinent\r\nat a time when the Council is trying to exert its own\r\nauthority and that of the United Nations in the process\r\nof the resolution of the question of Iraq.\r\nMalaysia strongly supports the call made by the\r\nSecretary-General and by other world leaders for\r\nrestraint and for the peaceful resolution of the issue, so\r\nas to spare the Iraqi people further suffering. We hope\r\nthat all diplomatic avenues will be explored and\r\ncooperation extended by all the parties concerned. We\r\nurge Iraq to allow the unconditional return of United\r\nNations arms inspectors and to comply with all the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. The Council\r\nmust act with courage and wisdom and consider all\r\naspects and implications of its action. Its very prestige\r\nand credibility hinges on this.\r\nThe Security Council should also listen to the\r\nviews of the larger membership of the Organization. In\r\nthis regard, my delegation welcomes the decision of the\r\nCouncil to convene an open meeting on this issue on\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nWednesday 16 October. We look forward to\r\nparticipating in that important debate.\r\nMy delegation wishes to congratulate the\r\nChairman of the Council’s Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee for his dynamic leadership and the\r\nCommittee’s other members for their contribution\r\ntowards the effectiveness of the Committee. We also\r\nwish to commend all States Members of the United\r\nNations for their cooperation in the implementation of\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). This is an excellent illustration\r\nof the effectiveness of the multilateral approach when\r\nall Member States fully cooperate in the\r\nimplementation of Council resolutions.\r\nWe would have hoped that the same level of\r\ncooperation would have been extended by all Member\r\nStates in the implementation of all resolutions of the\r\nCouncil. Regrettably, this has not been the case. There\r\nhas been, unfortunately, selectivity in the approach\r\ntaken to the implementation of Council resolutions and\r\nin enforcing compliance without discrimination — a\r\nfact to which the Secretary-General has himself\r\nalluded. My delegation hopes that in view of the efforts\r\nbeing made to enhance the credibility of the Council —\r\nabout which much has been said these days — this fact\r\nwill not be lost on Council members.\r\nMy delegation wholeheartedly supports the call\r\nmade by some members of the Council for the adoption\r\nof clear and precise indicators to measure the work of\r\nthe Council. We believe that one such indicator, which\r\nwould also reflect the effectiveness of the Council,\r\nwould be the level of compliance by Member States in\r\nimplementing the resolutions of the Council.\r\nMy delegation regrets that, despite the efforts of\r\nMr. Kavan’s predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, and the two Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform, there has been no breakthrough in the Group’s\r\nwork. While the Working Group has contributed\r\nsignificantly to the reform of the Council over the\r\nyears, particularly in improving its working methods,\r\nthere has been no progress with regard to the major\r\nissues, namely, the expansion of the Council and the\r\nquestion of the veto.\r\nThe debate on these important issues continues to\r\nbe contentious, circular and repetitive, even as we are\r\napproaching a full decade of these deliberations in the\r\nWorking Group next year. It is therefore not surprising\r\nthat the level of interest has declined in recent years. It\r\nhas been two years since our heads of State or\r\nGovernment, resolved in the Millennium Declaration\r\nto, inter alia, intensify efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. Unless there is greater political will on the part\r\nof those concerned to move the process forward, these\r\ndeliberations might well end up as an exercise in\r\nfutility. The tenth anniversary of these deliberations\r\nwould be a good occasion for us to take stock of the\r\nwork of the Working Group and to ponder where we\r\nshould go from here.\r\nWe hope that under the leadership of the current\r\nPresident of the Assembly, a new momentum will be\r\ngenerated in the Working Group, so that something\r\nmore tangible could be achieved as we enter the tenth\r\nyear of these deliberations. In the meantime, the\r\nprogress made thus far in respect of the Council’s\r\nworking methods should be codified — as suggested\r\nby the Secretary-General — to ensure that the\r\nagreements reached on these issues remain a permanent\r\nfeature of the Council. This is important for purposes\r\nof marking the progress made so far and for purposes\r\nof continuity, as, aside from the permanent members,\r\nother Council members come and go, once they have\r\nserved their very brief term.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the delegations of Angola,\r\nChile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain on their recent\r\nelection as the new non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council beginning 1 January 2003. We are\r\nconfident that they will not only serve the United\r\nNations and the international community well in\r\ndischarging their responsibilities as members of the\r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, but also enrich the deliberations of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Fadaifard (Islamic Republic of Iran): Let me\r\nbegin by offering my delegation’s condolences to the\r\npeople and the Government of Indonesia and to the\r\nfamilies of those who lost their lives as a result of the\r\nrecent brutal terrorist attack in Bali.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank Ambassador\r\nBelinga-Eboutou of Cameron, the President of the\r\nSecurity Council, for having introduced the annual\r\nreport of the Council to the General Assembly.\r\nHaving carefully considered the report submitted\r\nby the Council, we recognize and welcome the visible\r\nimprovements made in both its content and format. In\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\ngeneral, instead of simply compiling or quantitatively\r\ndescribing its activities, the Council, this time, has\r\nsubmitted a document that is more analytical and has\r\ntaken into account basic criticisms levelled at it for\r\nmany years by the members of the General Assembly.\r\nWhat has been done is a contribution to the\r\nimprovement of the Council’s reporting method. We\r\ncommend all members of the Council, especially\r\nAmbassador Mahbubani of Singapore and his team, for\r\npressing forward and accomplishing this outcome.\r\nWe note that the report has a new format. It is\r\nstreamlined, more focused and concise and shorter,\r\navoiding overlapping and repetition, thereby also\r\nreducing the cost of its production. Thus, we believe\r\nthat, to some extent, the present report has rectified a\r\ndefect in the way the Council previously reported to\r\nthe Assembly. While it is dramatically reduced in size,\r\nit also provides more statistical information on the\r\nCouncil’s activities.\r\nAs to the content of the report, we are pleased to\r\nnote an analytical overview in the introduction to the\r\nreport. This is the most important innovation in the\r\nreport and represents an effort made this year to\r\naddress the main criticism repeated year after year in\r\nthe General Assembly’s debate on the Council’s report.\r\nThis section for the first time focuses on areas of\r\nCouncil activities which are of interest to the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nAs the report indicates, a record number of open\r\nmeetings of the Council was held in the period under\r\nreview. Apparently, the Council has never in its history\r\nheld so many public meetings. This is a fact that has\r\nhad a positive impact on the Council in the area of\r\ntransparency and openness in its work and its\r\nrelationship with the wider United Nations\r\nmembership. It has enabled the Council to provide\r\ngreater opportunity to non-members of the Council to\r\nparticipate in its work. It is important that the Council\r\nbuild upon this achievement and enhance closer links\r\nbetween the members of the Council and those of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The record shows that, in the period\r\nunder consideration, the Council also opened up to\r\ncivil society through Arria-formula meetings, which\r\nenable the Council to meet with the representatives of\r\nnon-governmental organizations. There should be no\r\ndoubt that the Council is still at the beginning of a long\r\nroad and that a lot has yet to be done with a view to\r\ndemocratizing its work.\r\nIn general, the working methods of the Council,\r\ntoo, have noticeably improved over the past few years.\r\nUndoubtedly, the ideas expressed and progress made in\r\nthe course of the deliberations in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Council played an\r\nimportant part in this respect. Better procedures and\r\nworking methods can generate more efficiency and\r\neffectiveness and bring the Council into tune with the\r\ngeneral membership. We believe that the Council\r\nmissions to regions affected by conflicts are valuable\r\ninstruments. Monthly wrap-up meetings also provide\r\nan opportunity for an interactive discussion among\r\nmembers and non-members, even though there are\r\nmembers who have reservations about such meetings.\r\nWe acknowledge that the period under review\r\nwas extraordinary for the Council in a number of ways\r\nand uniquely busy. The events of 11 September set the\r\ntone and overshadowed the work of the Council for the\r\nwhole period. Thus, the Council was expected to play\r\nan important role in coordinating the international fight\r\nagainst terrorism. It also needed to deal with the chaos\r\ncreated by the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.\r\nThe swift action of the Security Council in adopting\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) and in establishing the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee was its main achievement with\r\nrespect to combating terrorism, and a united Council at\r\na critical moment in the history of Afghanistan played\r\nan important role through its swift decision in pushing\r\nfor comprehensive implementation of the Bonn\r\nAgreement. From now on, it is important that the\r\nCouncil continue to contribute both to the fight against\r\nterrorism, thus enhancing the role of the United\r\nNations in this area, and to upholding the effective\r\nengagement of the international community in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nThe Council has had its share of successes and\r\nfailures. While it has thus far been effective in dealing\r\nwith terrorism and the situations in Afghanistan, East\r\nTimor and Sierra Leone, some issues on its agenda\r\nclearly need more attention. The Council has had a\r\nserious level of engagement with issues related to\r\nAfrica and there have been some positive\r\ndevelopments in African conflicts. However, there is\r\nstill a gap between the work of the Council and the\r\nexpectations of African States and people.\r\nThe Middle East is the area in which the Council\r\nhas achieved the least and clearly fallen short of\r\nexpectations. While we appreciate the fact that there is\r\nnow a monthly briefing of the Council on the Middle\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.27\r\nEast, we note that the record of the Council on this\r\nissue has yet to improve. It has yet to take measures\r\nwith a view to implementing its resolutions, the latest\r\nof which is resolution 1435 (2002). There is no doubt\r\nthat the credibility of the Council will erode over time\r\nif it is habitually seen to be unable to meet its\r\nresponsibilities with regard to outstanding issues on its\r\nagenda.\r\nAllow me to briefly touch upon the important\r\nissue of the reform of the Security Council. Nine years\r\nhave elapsed since the establishment of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. The debate in the course of the last session of\r\nthe Working Group has in fact proved that significant\r\ndifferences remain on such substantive matters as the\r\nsize and composition of the Security Council,\r\nespecially an increase in the permanent membership,\r\nand the power of veto. In other words, the fundamental\r\nquestion as to how to advance from the Security\r\nCouncil that we have now to a more representative and\r\ndemocratic, but no less efficient, organ has yet to be\r\nanswered.\r\nNevertheless, the impasse or lack of progress in\r\nthe expansion of the permanent membership of the\r\nCouncil should be viewed as a direct product of the\r\nenormous importance of the issue and the diversity of\r\nviews and interests. Despite the lack of progress on the\r\nmain issues, we still believe that the process of the\r\nreform of the Council should not be subject to any\r\npredetermined and superficial timetable. Any attempt\r\nto impose a premature, hasty decision would run the\r\nrisk of doing harm to that very delicate process, which\r\nis so important to all the States Members of our\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe are of the view that, due to the importance of\r\nthe Council’s reform and while respecting the principle\r\nof the equality of all Member States, all efforts should\r\nbe made to reach the broadest possible agreement\r\namong the Member States.\r\nAs to the objectives of the reform of the Council,\r\nwe continue to believe that the objective of the reform\r\nprocess is and must remain to make the Council more\r\nrepresentative, more democratic, more transparent and\r\nmore accountable, thereby helping to strengthen its\r\nefficiency and to increase its authority and that of the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. We believe that the\r\nattainment of these objectives requires, inter alia, that\r\nthe membership of the Council be expanded to at least\r\n26 so that the developing world can be better\r\nrepresented.\r\nMoreover, the opinion of the vast majority of the\r\nStates Members of the United Nations that continue to\r\nexpress their dissatisfaction about the use of the veto as\r\nan undemocratic instrument in the decision-making\r\nprocess of the Security Council should be heeded. The\r\ngeneral support for limiting and curtailing the use of\r\nthe veto with a view to its eventual elimination needs\r\nto be explicitly reflected in the final outcome of the\r\nWorking Group.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nmembers that, in a letter dated 27 September 2002\r\naddressed to the President of the General Assembly, the\r\nPermanent Representative of Portugal to the United\r\nNations, in his capacity as chairman of the Group of\r\nWestern European and other States for the month of\r\nSeptember, requests that the General Assembly hear in\r\nplenary meeting a statement by the Observer of the\r\nHoly See in the debate on agenda item 31, “Elimination\r\nof unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion”.\r\nMay I take it that there is no objection to the\r\nproposal to hear a statement by the Observer of the\r\nHoly See in the debate on agenda item 31?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
