Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n02-63587 (E)\r\n*0263587*\r\nPresident: Mr. Kavan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Aguilar Zinser\r\n(Mexico), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 40 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/57/2 and\r\nA/57/2/Corr.1)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nOn behalf of my country, I would like to begin by\r\nexpressing our solidarity with the Government and\r\npeople of Indonesia and with the family members of\r\nthe victims of the terrorist act that took place this past\r\nweekend. This was an event of great seriousness that\r\nwill likely attract the attention of the United Nations as\r\nit discharges its responsibility in the area of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe joint consideration of these two agenda items\r\nis not only appropriate, it is also particularly important\r\nto relations between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly. At the outset, I would like to thank\r\nthe President of the Council, the Ambassador of\r\nCameroon, for his introduction of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. We would also like to emphasize the\r\nfact that this debate is taking place at a very important\r\ntime, given the successful effort of the Security\r\nCouncil to adopt a new report to the General Assembly\r\non its activities that is more flexible, shorter, more\r\npertinent and, so far as possible, more analytical. That\r\neffort was justified in that it promoted greater\r\ntransparency in the work of the Council; underscored\r\nthe special responsibility of the members of the\r\nCouncil towards the Assembly, which has been referred\r\nto as accountability; and contributed to better\r\nfunctioning of a body whose composition and working\r\nmethods are often questioned. The changes made in the\r\nreport were the result of persistent efforts made mainly\r\nby the elected members of the Council, namely, those\r\nmembers whom the Assembly has entrusted to\r\nrepresent it.\r\nThe criticisms made concerning the format of the\r\nreport routinely sent to the Assembly were always\r\njustified and reasonable. Much of that criticism was\r\nexpressed in meetings such as the ones taking place\r\nduring these two days. It has therefore been very\r\nsatisfying for Colombia, which will very soon conclude\r\nits term of office in the Council, to have taken part in\r\nthis common exercise. We would like to emphasize the\r\nrole played by Singapore and other members who\r\nalways demonstrated keen interest in the subject.\r\nAmong the permanent members, a special tribute\r\nshould be paid to the United Kingdom, which has\r\nshown great willingness to consider reforms in the\r\nworking methods of the Council in a constructive\r\nspirit.\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nAs we have said in the Council, the adoption of\r\nthe new report is a lesson to the members of this\r\nprincipal organ, whether permanent or elected, that\r\nthese things can be done without disrupting the\r\npolitical situation. It is also a lesson for the Secretariat,\r\nwhich at the beginning expressed doubt, saying that it\r\nwas very uncomfortable about such an exercise.\r\nHowever, we can only be pleased with the new\r\nreport when it achieves the only thing that is truly of\r\nimportance; that is, when it shows that it has\r\ncontributed in a better way to a situation whereby the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly and members of the\r\ninternational community are enabled to critically\r\nobserve the work of the Security Council. The report in\r\nits new form must now contribute to this new critical\r\nvision, promote a more informed debate and make it\r\npossible for members of the Council to work in such a\r\nway that the rest of the membership of the United\r\nNations can examine its work more constructively.\r\nHowever, all we can say thus far is that the\r\nchanges have been of limited effectiveness. That is\r\nwhy it would be very useful to continue making\r\nreforms when possible — reforms based on suggestions\r\nand proposals that are set forth in debates like the one\r\nbeing held today, as well as on the renewed\r\ncommitment and solidarity of the voice of the General\r\nAssembly in the Council.\r\nWhen considering the last report in relation to\r\nother innovations, we believe that the proposal by the\r\nSecretary-General in document A/57/387 on the\r\ncodification of changes that have taken place as\r\nworking methods is very appropriate. This exercise\r\nmakes political sense and would be a major\r\ncontribution to transparency without damaging the\r\nprovisional rules of procedure.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report, the\r\nSecurity Council has been faced with many challenges.\r\nThere has been the collapse of the Taliban regime and\r\nthe installation of the United Nations Assistance\r\nMission to Afghanistan; measures have had to be taken\r\nagainst international terrorism in the Security Council\r\nCommittee established by resolution 1267 (1999),\r\npresided over by Colombia, and the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, presided over by the United Kingdom.\r\nThere have also been changes to the presence of the\r\nUnited Nations in East Timor following its\r\nindependence; the impasse in the conflict in Angola\r\nhas moved forward after the death of Jonas Savimbi,\r\nand there are now new efforts to bring about peace in\r\nthat country; and there have been presidential elections\r\nin Sierra Leone, with the participation of the\r\nRevolutionary United Front as a political party. I would\r\nlike to point out the first positive signs regarding\r\ngeneral political agreements and the beginning of the\r\nwithdrawal, which must be final, of foreign troops\r\nfrom the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Finally, I\r\nwant to highlight the decision of the committee on\r\nborders between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the situation\r\nregarding security in Somalia and the possibility for a\r\nprocess of reconciliation.\r\nPerhaps it may be too early to give a critical and\r\nwise assessment of these actions, but in all the cases\r\nthat I have mentioned, the success or failure of the\r\nCouncil will depend largely on the motivation that it\r\nhas in the coming months and years. There must be a\r\nreal commitment in the Security Council to defend\r\ncollective interest, and overcome the temptation to act\r\nin exclusive ways favouring only national interests or\r\nlesser goals.\r\nI will conclude with a few comments regarding\r\nthe reform of Security Council. The progress that has\r\nbeen made in Cluster II can lead to a more realistic\r\ndebate on this topic. It is recognized that the expansion\r\nof the Council continues to be a contentious issue. But\r\nif you, Sir, encourage the members of the Council to\r\nhold a dialogue on more realistic goals, perhaps we\r\nmay be able to agree on an expansion for the non-\r\npermanent members. This could be accompanied by an\r\nintensification of efforts in favour of constructive\r\nreforms in working methods which should be\r\nconsistent with the overall approach taken to the\r\nsubject as described in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): Allow me, on behalf of\r\nmy delegation, to express our heart-felt condolences to\r\nthe Government and people of Indonesia and to the\r\nfamilies of the victims of the explosion that took place\r\nin Bali. Our deepest sympathies also go to all the\r\ncountries whose nationals were victims of this tragic\r\nevent.\r\nThe consideration of this item this year is\r\ndifferent in many respects. First, the format of the\r\nreport of the Security Council has been reconfigured in\r\nresponse to the views expressed and suggestions made\r\nby Member States. Secondly, the two reports have been\r\nclustered together for a joint debate, which brings\r\nharmony and logic to our consideration of these two\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nvery pertinent issues. Lastly, and perhaps even most\r\nimportant, this joint debate is taking place at a time\r\nwhen a cloud of war hangs over our heads, and when\r\naction or inaction in the Security Council could make\r\nthe difference between war and peace.\r\nIt is the hope of my delegation therefore that the\r\nSecurity Council will indeed take into account the\r\nviews that will be expressed over the next two days.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nAngola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain for their\r\nelection to the Council.\r\nFor nine years, the Open-ended Working Group\r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and\r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council\r\nand other Matters Related to the Security Council has\r\nbeen deliberating on how to make the Council\r\ndemocratic, representative and responsive to the needs\r\nof all Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe question needs not be asked as to how much\r\nprogress has been achieved from one General\r\nAssembly session to another. It has become ritualistic\r\nfor preceding Assembly sessions to take note of the\r\nreport of the Working Group, welcome progress made\r\nand decide that the succeeding General Assembly\r\nsession would continue consideration of Security\r\nCouncil reform through this Working Group.\r\nDuring the second session of the Working Group,\r\ndiscussion with Council members stressed progress in\r\nthe work of the Council on its reforms. Indeed, some\r\nsteps have been taken with regard to the working\r\nmethods of the Security Council. These include\r\nimprovements in the Arria formula, meetings with\r\ntroop-contributing countries and other countries\r\ncontributing to peace-keeping operations, briefings by\r\nthe President of the Security Council to non-Council\r\nmembers, availability of draft resolutions and\r\nsummaries of meetings and informal consultations of\r\nthe whole.\r\nThese are all welcomed measures adding value to\r\nthe Security Council reform process. However, they do\r\nnot address the core of the problem: the imbalanced\r\ndecision-making process of the Security Council. What\r\ndeveloping countries need is their democratic right to\r\nparticipate in decision-making on issues of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nLet me recall that General Assembly resolution\r\n48/26 of 3 December 1993, among other things,\r\nrecognized in its fifth preambular paragraph,\r\n“the need to review the membership of the\r\nSecurity Council and related matters in view of\r\nthe substantial increase in the membership of the\r\nUnited Nations, especially of developing\r\ncountries, as well as the changes in international\r\nrelations”.\r\nThe resolution refers to the increase in the\r\nnumber of developing countries, which constitute the\r\noverwhelming majority of the Organization’s\r\nmembership. It cites changes in international relations\r\nbecause those changes make up the agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council and, almost without exception, either\r\naffect or happen mostly in developing countries,\r\nespecially in Africa. So it is logical that developing\r\ncountries call for appropriate representation on the\r\nSecurity Council. In that context, Namibia stands by\r\nthe decision of the African Union that Africa deserves\r\ntwo permanent and five non-permanent seats on the\r\nCouncil. Africa’s decision that the two permanent seats\r\nfor Africa will be filled on a rotational basis\r\ndemonstrates the collective, representative and\r\ndemocratic spirit in which Africa is pursuing this vital\r\nissue.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1234 (1999) affirms,\r\ninter alia, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and calls for the\r\nwithdrawal of uninvited forces from the territory of\r\nthat country. We welcome the latest developments in\r\nthat regard. We applaud the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary-General to increase the personnel of the\r\nUnited Nations Organization Mission in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), and we\r\ncall on the Council to implement that recommendation.\r\nWe look forward to the report of the Council on the\r\nillegal exploitation of the natural resources of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and express our\r\ndesire to see the Council take appropriate action so that\r\nthose resources can benefit the rightful owners — the\r\npeople of the country.\r\nOn Angola, we note the agreement in the Council\r\nto review the mandate of the United Nations Mission in\r\nAngola. It is our hope that all required assistance will\r\nbe made available to assist the Angolan people in the\r\nconsolidation of peace. In that context, we call on the\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\ninternational community to provide humanitarian\r\nassistance to those in need in Angola.\r\nThe successful elections held in Sierra Leone are\r\nonly the beginning of the consolidation of peace-\r\nbuilding. The situation around Sierra Leone calls for\r\nthe continued presence of the United Nations and the\r\nengagement of the international community in that\r\ncountry.\r\nOn 27 September 2002, we finally and joyfully\r\nwelcomed the sovereign and independent State of\r\nTimor-Leste to the community of nations. We\r\ncongratulate the people of that country for that noble\r\nachievement. The President of Timor-Leste, in his\r\naddress during the admission of his country, paid\r\ntribute to the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity at large for having assisted the people of\r\nTimor-Leste in realizing their right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nHe further went on to say that the people of\r\nWestern Sahara also deserve their right to self-\r\ndetermination. Therefore, the fundamental question we\r\nhave to ask ourselves is what did the Security Council,\r\nin particular, do in the case of Timor-Leste which it\r\nneeds to do in the case of Western Sahara? Is the\r\ninternational community showing the same resolve on\r\nthe implementation of the United Nations Settlement\r\nPlan for Western Sahara and the right to self-\r\ndetermination of the Saharan people?\r\nLet me point out that in the report of the Security\r\nCouncil under discussion, Western Sahara is referred to\r\nonly in the introduction and is entirely omitted from\r\nthe activities relating to all questions considered by the\r\nSecurity Council under its responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We\r\nask that this serious omission be rectified. Namibia\r\ncalls on the Council to see to it that the United Nations\r\nSettlement Plan for Western Sahara is implemented.\r\nThe Secretary-General should therefore continue to\r\nwork towards that end.\r\nThe report of the Security Council rightly points\r\nout that the Council broke new ground with the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee in the degree to which it\r\nhas engaged in cooperation with every Member State in\r\nthe follow-up to Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nincluding help to Member States seeking technical and\r\nfinancial assistance. We underscore the need for the\r\nSecurity Council to follow through, among other\r\nthings, with providing assistance to developing\r\ncountries in the implementation of resolution 1373\r\n(2001).\r\nNamibia firmly believes that all Security Council\r\nresolutions must be implemented by the relevant\r\nparties, failing which the Council and, indeed, the\r\nentire Organization loses credibility. But when the\r\nSecurity Council unanimously adopts four resolutions\r\non the Middle East during the period under review and\r\nnone of them see implementation, what message does\r\nthis send to the parties, and especially to the\r\nPalestinian people, whose only hope rests in the\r\nimplementation of the Council resolutions? The\r\nCouncil must do all it can to help bring about peace in\r\nthe Middle East.\r\nOn Iraq, the report of the Security Council states,\r\ninter alia, that the Secretary-General’s dialogue with\r\nIraq was renewed and that members of the Council\r\nwere supportive of that process. My delegation sees\r\nmerit in that process and urges its continuation.\r\nIn its efforts to make the work of the United\r\nNations more transparent, the general membership has\r\nhad opportunities to make their views heard before the\r\nconsideration of Council resolutions. That was\r\ncertainly the case with Council resolution 1325 (2000)\r\non women, peace and security, and the presidential\r\nstatement on disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration, to mention but a few. Security Council\r\nresolutions are binding on all Member States.\r\nDecisions in the Council are taken by a few in the\r\nname of all Members of the Organization. It is only\r\nlogical, therefore, that the Council hears the views and\r\nopinions of the larger membership before it adopts\r\nresolutions, especially those under Chapter VII of the\r\nCharter, which are enforceable.\r\nThe democratization and enlargement of the\r\nSecurity Council should be seen as an integral part of\r\nthe overall reform of the United Nations. Hence, we\r\ncannot open up the rest of the United Nations system\r\nand leave the Security Council intact. The indefinite\r\ndeferral of the enlargement and democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council will amount to the gradual erosion of\r\nits prestige.\r\nMr. Mbanefo (Nigeria): Allow me, through you,\r\nSir, to extend the sympathy of my delegation to the\r\npeople of Indonesia for the tragic events that took place\r\nin that country very recently.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nI wish to express our appreciation to the President\r\nof the Security Council, the Permanent Representative\r\nof the Republic of Cameroon, for introducing the report\r\nof the Council to the General Assembly. I also take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate Spain, Germany, Pakistan,\r\nChile and Angola on their election as non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Council for 2003 and 2004.\r\nThe report of the Security Council provides an\r\ninvaluable insight into the activities the Council\r\nundertook last year. According to the report, the\r\nCouncil held 192 formal meetings, comprising 159\r\npublic and 33 private meetings. Eleven “Arria formula”\r\nmeetings were also held with representatives of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, academia and the media.\r\nThe Council adopted 73 resolutions and issued 45\r\npresidential statements. Furthermore, the Council held\r\nconsultations of the whole, considered numerous\r\nreports of the Secretary-General and reviewed and\r\nprocessed documents and communications from States\r\nand regional and intergovernmental organizations.\r\nThe report, which highlighted such issues as the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council, represents\r\nthe effort of the Council to make itself accountable to\r\nthe membership of the United Nations, in accordance\r\nwith the provisions of Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nNigeria is encouraged by the fact that the Council\r\nhas begun to respond positively to the demand that the\r\nreport be more analytical, concise and easy to read.\r\nThere has been a significant reduction in the size of the\r\nreport, and more statistical information is provided.\r\nThe introduction, which summarizes activities of the\r\nCouncil as they relate to specific conflict areas of the\r\nworld, is welcome, as it makes the report easy to read\r\nand the information easy to access. We commend this\r\nnew format and urge that more improvement be made\r\nas the work of the Council progresses.\r\nMy delegation would like to address the\r\nfollowing specific headings in the report.\r\nFirst, there is the issue of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The issue of conflicts\r\nand the maintenance of international peace and security\r\ncontinue to pose enormous challenges to the Security\r\nCouncil. We note that, while the Council has succeeded\r\nin making progress in the resolution of some conflicts,\r\nas reflected in the noticeable increase in the number of\r\npeace agreements, the Council, in conjunction with the\r\ninternational community, still needs to do more to\r\nmake the world a peaceful place in which to live. In\r\nthis regard, Nigeria endorses the involvement of the\r\nwider society, including subregional and regional\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations,\r\ninternational financial institutions and developmental\r\nagencies, in the process of conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution. Their collective\r\ncontributions no doubt substantially help in the\r\nreduction of socio-political and economic pressures,\r\nthe diffusion of which often leads to violent conflict or,\r\nsometimes, war.\r\nOn the subject of Sierra Leone, we note the\r\nprogress made since the conclusion of democratic\r\nelections in that country. We support the Security\r\nCouncil’s Adjustment Withdrawal Plan and hope that\r\ncaution will be applied in the implementation to ensure\r\nthat the security of the country is not impacted\r\nnegatively.\r\nWe call on the Council to assist in the completion\r\nof the integration of ex-combatants. Assistance should\r\nalso be extended to the training of Sierra Leone’s\r\npolice and army, which would be totally responsible for\r\nmaintaining security in the country following the\r\nwithdrawal of United Nations troops. The Sierra Leone\r\nGovernment should further be assisted to establish an\r\neffective civilian administration and political\r\ninstitutions, particularly the courts, that will ensure\r\npractical implementation of the rule of law.\r\nNigeria endorses the Security Council’s efforts in\r\naddressing a complex humanitarian political and\r\nsecurity situation in the Mano River Union States.\r\nHowever, we call for a comprehensive security\r\narrangement for the entire Mano River Union, instead\r\nof the current ad hoc strategy. We commend the\r\nSecurity Council’s visit to the area last year and urge\r\nthat the momentum be sustained, given the rather fluid\r\npolitical situation in the area.\r\nWe commend the Security Council for facilitating\r\nthe peace process in Angola and welcome the\r\nestablishment of an enhanced United Nations mission,\r\nas this will strengthen the urgently needed assistance in\r\nthe peace-building, demobilization and quartering\r\nprogramme.\r\nAs regards the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Nigeria remains committed to the support of\r\nthe Security Council to accomplish its current mandate\r\nin that country. We welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendation on the expansion of the mandate. We\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\ncommend Council assistance in the implementation of\r\nthe disarmament, demobilization and rehabilitation\r\nprogramme and urge troop-contributing countries to\r\nprovide troops, personnel and equipment for the much-\r\nneeded Air Field Services Unit. Nigeria will continue\r\nto support the inter-Congolese dialogue, which we\r\nhope will lead to a durable peace and crystallize into\r\nformation of an all-inclusive Government.\r\nThe Security Council and the international\r\ncommunity should support the South African-led peace\r\nprocess in Burundi. Meanwhile, we call on the parties\r\nto give peace a chance and observe a ceasefire to\r\nensure effective international support in resolving the\r\nconflict.\r\nOn the subject of terrorism, Nigeria notes the\r\nSecurity Council’s prompt response to the threat of\r\nterrorism after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks\r\non the United States of America, with the adoption of\r\nresolution 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), which\r\ncondemned the attacks and established the Security\r\nCouncil Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC). The\r\nCTC has effectively galvanized an international\r\ncoalition against terrorism, and this has proved the\r\ndetermination of the Council to live up to its Charter\r\nobligation for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security. We remain committed to the global effort\r\nto combat international terrorism in all its\r\nramifications.\r\nIn terms of working methods and the briefing of\r\ntroop-contributing countries, Nigeria commends the\r\nregular briefings by the Security Council to non-\r\nmembers of the Council, as well as the briefing of\r\nChairmen of Regional Groups. We note the regularity\r\nof these meetings and consultations with\r\ntroop-contributing countries, especially the recently\r\nintroduced system of briefing troop-contributing\r\ncountries before the report of the Secretary-General on\r\na mission is presented to the Council. We consider this\r\npractice a welcome development, as it enables the\r\ntroop-contributing countries to express their views and\r\noffer ideas and suggestions for the overall\r\nimprovement of the peacekeeping mandate. As a major\r\ntroop-contributing country, Nigeria believes that the\r\ncontinuation of this process of consultation by the\r\nSecurity Council will eliminate friction and facilitate\r\neffective peacekeeping operations in the field.\r\nWe urge that the monthly wrap-up meetings of\r\nthe Council remain as informal and interactive as\r\npossible. We support these meetings, as they provide\r\nMember States the opportunity to exchange views with\r\nthe Council and enable them to benefit from lessons\r\nlearned by all sides.\r\nWe note that the Security Council undertook a\r\nnumber of ad hoc missions to some conflict locations\r\nduring the period under review. Nigeria appreciates and\r\nendorses this strategy. It is our belief that such\r\nmissions will enhance the ability of the Council to\r\nassess situations on the ground and to anticipate,\r\nprevent as well as respond adequately to such\r\nsituations. However, we would still urge that officials\r\nof subregional and regional organizations be invited to\r\nparticipate in such missions. Furthermore, the Council\r\nshould endeavour to consult more with subregional and\r\nregional organizations before missions are undertaken.\r\nIn this regard, Nigeria commends the Council’s\r\nmissions to West Africa, the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and the Great Lakes. We urge that more\r\nsuch trips be undertaken, as the missions could be\r\nmorale-boosting and also capable of encouraging good\r\ngovernance in those countries.\r\nNigeria reaffirms its support for the thematic\r\ndebates in the Council on such issues as the prevention\r\nof armed conflict, HIV/AIDS and international\r\npeacekeeping, gender and peacekeeping, and civilians\r\nin armed conflict. These debates have always provided\r\nopportunities for the Council and Member States to\r\nfocus on related issues with a view to finding\r\nappropriate solutions. We hope that such efforts will be\r\nsustained.\r\nWe recall that, at the fifty-fifth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Millennium Declaration\r\nreaffirmed faith in the United Nations and its Charter\r\nas an indispensable foundation of a more peaceful,\r\nprosperous and just world. It further resolved to\r\nintensify efforts towards achieving a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council in all its aspects.\r\nNigeria therefore reiterates its support for the\r\nDeclaration. We also believe that the Security Council\r\nneeds to reflect the realities of the twenty-first century\r\nin order to better serve the interests of our Organization\r\nand its Charter, especially in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Nigeria will therefore\r\ncontinue to support the increase in the membership of\r\nthe Council in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories on the basis of equitable geographical\r\ndistribution, in line with the position of the African\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nUnion, which calls for at least two permanent seats for\r\nAfrica in an enlarged Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, Nigeria pledges its support for the\r\nefforts of the Security Council to make itself more\r\nresponsive to global challenges and the yearnings of\r\nMember States, and reiterates its determination to\r\nencourage the Council as it continues to improve its\r\nwork methods and discharges its responsibility justly in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nin accordance with the United Nations Charter.\r\nMr. Kerim (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): In light of current circumstances, our\r\ndiscussion on the report of the Security Council for the\r\nperiod June 2001 to July 2002 presents us with a\r\nunique task. As we review its report, we see that the\r\nSecurity Council is confronted with an issue, the\r\nsituation in Iraq, which requires urgent and effective\r\naction that is in full compliance with the principles of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nAs Secretary-General Annan rightly pointed out\r\nin his address to the General Assembly on 12\r\nSeptember:\r\n“I urge Iraq to comply with its obligations,\r\nfor the sake of its own people and for the sake of\r\nworld order. If Iraq’s defiance continues, the\r\nSecurity Council must face its responsibilities.”\r\n(A/57/PV.2, p. 3)\r\nEventually, making the Security Council relevant to the\r\ncritical issues of the day is the most appropriate way to\r\nelevate its significance, stature and authority.\r\nWe look forward to the open Security Council\r\ndebate on Iraq, which has been scheduled for later this\r\nweek on the initiative of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nNo doubt, such a debate is necessary and useful. For\r\nthe sake of strengthening the authority of the United\r\nNations and acting in the spirit of multilateralism, the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia would find it appropriate for\r\nthe Security Council to adopt a resolution on Iraq that\r\nwould send a strong and clear signal.\r\nFrom our point of view, the Security Council has\r\nsubmitted a concise and sound report. In addition to\r\nthis general assessment, allow me to make a few\r\ncomments on some of the issues contained and\r\nelaborated on in the report.\r\nWe have noted with satisfaction improvements in\r\nthe working methods of the Council, particularly an\r\nincreasing degree of transparency. We also welcome\r\nthe periodic wrap-up meetings of the Security Council,\r\nas well as the practice by some non-permanent\r\nmembers of providing regular briefings to non-member\r\nStates on issues of crucial importance.\r\nWe commend the prompt and unanimous reaction\r\nof the Security Council concerning the events and\r\naftermath of 11 September 2001. Fighting international\r\nterrorism must remain at the top of the agenda of the\r\nUnited Nations and especially of the Security Council.\r\nIn this regard, we have a high appreciation for the\r\nactivities of the Counter-Terrorism Committee, under\r\nthe chairmanship of Ambassador Greenstock of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and its essential contribution to the\r\nfollow-up of resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nWe wish the Security Council would assume\r\nresponsibilities and demonstrate leadership in other\r\nsituations which have been outlined within the\r\nreport — situations in which the world has been\r\nconfronted by the nuclear threats of Member States\r\ninvolved in disputes that are apparently of a bilateral or\r\nregional character, but have potentially global\r\nconsequences.\r\nFinding a just, lasting and comprehensive\r\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is certainly the\r\nmost painful and sensitive issue for the Security\r\nCouncil, as well as for the United Nations as a whole.\r\nTherefore, we believe that the Security Council should\r\nremain steadfast in its efforts to implement resolution\r\n1397 (2002), as well as resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973), including the peace initiative adopted at the\r\nArab Summit in March 2002.\r\nWe fully concur with the assessments contained\r\nin the report on the Balkans. Within this context, we\r\nwould like to stress the considerable contribution of the\r\nSecurity Council and the Secretary-General to making\r\nprogress in the crisis management of that region.\r\nTogether with the European Union, the North Atlantic\r\nTreaty Organization and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations has\r\nmanaged to preserve peace and stability in the region.\r\nHowever, ethnic strife, organized crime and small arms\r\ncollection remain very important tasks to be dealt with.\r\nIn dealing with issues related to peace in the\r\nregion and the stability of my country, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, the Security Council has acted in a\r\nconsiderate and cooperative manner. In this respect, we\r\nwould like to mention the adoption of resolution 1371\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\n(2001). This is an excellent example of a quick,\r\nmeasured and effective response of the Security\r\nCouncil to events and developments which were of\r\nconcern not only to my country, but also to its\r\nimmediate neighbours and the entire region.\r\nFull engagement of the United Nations in Kosovo\r\nis of crucial importance in maintaining peace and\r\nstability in South-Eastern Europe. For this reason,\r\nacting in full compliance with Security Council\r\nresolutions 1160 (1998), 1199 (1998), 1203 (1998),\r\n1244 (1999) and 1345 (2001) is necessary. The\r\nbenchmarks set up by the Special Representative of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, implying standards before status,\r\nare in full accordance with this.\r\nIt is our deep conviction that the Security Council\r\nshould support the International Criminal Court\r\nunconditionally, ensuring that essential principles of\r\ninternational law are not compromised. In that context,\r\nwe fully support every effort made by the International\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to ensure that all\r\nindicted war criminals are brought to justice without\r\nfurther delay.\r\nWith regard to conflict prevention and\r\nhumanitarian issues, the Security Council has managed\r\nto make remarkable progress. In adopting its resolution\r\n1366 (2001), on conflict prevention, the Security\r\nCouncil expressed its full commitment to the further\r\nimplementation, throughout the entire United Nations\r\nsystem, of the recommendations of the Brahimi report\r\n(A/55/305) and the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nconflict prevention (A/55/985). The work carried out\r\nby the Security Council and the Secretary-General in\r\ndeveloping a policy framework for the protection of\r\ncivilians in armed conflict deserves our full support. It\r\nrepresents a substantial contribution to the setting up of\r\na coherent approach by the United Nations for the\r\nprotection of civilian populations during armed\r\nconflict.\r\nThis discussion of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil also presents an opportunity to reflect on the\r\nUnited Nations as a whole. In making the United\r\nNations a strong multilateral institution in the era of\r\nglobalization, we must make sure that it enjoys\r\ncredibility in all parts of the globe. The Security\r\nCouncil has to play a key role in that respect.\r\nThe strengthening of the United Nations system is\r\none of the highest-ranking issues on our common\r\nagenda. It also implies reform of the Security Council.\r\nOn the other hand, we must continue to be aware that\r\nthe Council’s decision-making authority is based on its\r\ncapacity to take prompt and realistically founded\r\ndecisions and actions. In our opinion, the most recent\r\nreport of the Security Council contains certain\r\nelements which live up to such expectations. Our final\r\ngoal, however, must still be to make the United Nations\r\na more meaningful, more powerful and more effective\r\nOrganization. In order to do so, every one of us must\r\nbe aware that in this situation, no one can afford to\r\nbehave like an ostrich with its head in the sand.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): My delegation welcomes this joint debate in\r\nthe General Assembly to discuss the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/57/2) and the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters, since we\r\nbelieve that the two issues are closely linked. The\r\nholding of this joint debate is a good start to the\r\nrationalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nand will be an encouragement to the Secretary-General,\r\nwho is endeavouring to increase the effectiveness and\r\nefficiency of the Organization.\r\nCertain procedures relating to the improvement of\r\nthe Council’s working methods are covered by both\r\nissues under discussion today. The Security Council\r\nhas already begun to implement some of those\r\nprocedures. In its annual report the Security Council\r\nprovides evidence that consultations among troop-\r\ncontributing countries has led to a great improvement\r\nin its work. Monthly appraisals of Security Council\r\nPresidents and open formal meetings have been very\r\nuseful. This year’s document does not contain the\r\nvoluminous accounts that were included in the past.\r\nRather, it contains brief accounts that provide adequate\r\ninformation on the deliberations of the Council. We\r\nlook forward to further improvements in future reports,\r\nin accordance with part III of this year’s report. The\r\nimprovements that have been made were based on the\r\nserious work undertaken by the Assembly’s Open-\r\nended Working Group. We commend the Working\r\nGroup; it must continue its efforts.\r\nThe Council’s report refers only briefly to the\r\npractice of informal consultations, which have become\r\nthe real mechanism by which decisions are taken in the\r\nCouncil. We know that such consultations precede the\r\nadoption of draft resolutions; the decisions have\r\nalready been taken by the time the Council holds the\r\npublic meetings in which the general membership is\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nable to participate. Thus Member States are presented\r\nwith a fait accompli, as decisions have already been\r\ntaken in informal consultations.\r\nWe would like the Council to further expand its\r\ncooperation with the general membership and with\r\nregional and subregional organizations, in accordance\r\nwith Chapter VIII of the Charter. We hope that the\r\nCouncil will conduct a general review of its\r\nprocedures. Improvements must be mandatory if they\r\nare to have a real impact on working methods.\r\nEnhancing the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and the other principal organs of the United\r\nNations is essential. It is unacceptable that the\r\nCouncil’s relationship with the General Assembly\r\nshould be confined to the issuance of an annual report.\r\nCooperation between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly should be further expanded in accordance\r\nwith Article 24 of the Charter. We also believe that the\r\nrelations between the Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the International Court of Justice\r\nshould be further expanded.\r\nThe Security Council should be impartial and\r\nobjective and avoid selectivity and double standards\r\nwhen dealing with the various issues on its agenda. If\r\ntransparency and democracy are the true foundations\r\non which the legitimacy of national Governments rests,\r\nthey should also apply to the United Nations,\r\nparticularly the Security Council.\r\nThe practice of holding consultations behind\r\nclosed doors among a very limited number of Council\r\nmembers should stop immediately. Failing to take\r\naction in this respect will result in one single\r\ncountry — or a very few countries — becoming the\r\ndecision makers in the Council. This would cast doubt\r\non the legitimacy of the Council’s resolutions, which\r\nare adopted on behalf of the international community.\r\nThe Security Council will also perform its duties\r\nbetter when its composition reflects a more equitable\r\ngeographic distribution. The Non-Aligned Movement\r\nhas always stood firm on this issue, as we believe that\r\nexpansion of the membership of the Council should be\r\nbased on the principle of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates. We believe that the non-permanent category of\r\nmembership should be expanded. There should be no\r\nincrease in the number of permanent members, as we\r\ndo not want more members with special privileges.\r\nWe believe that expansion should be carried out\r\nin a non-selective manner and should take account of\r\nthe limits imposed by the Organization’s budget. We\r\nshould also focus on increasing the resources of\r\npeacekeeping operations so as to weaken the power\r\nwielded by the strong over the weak. The general\r\nmembership should be represented in an equitable and\r\nfair manner. Africa does not have an adequate number\r\nof seats in the Council much less a permanent seat,\r\nalthough the African Group has more members than\r\nany other regional group in the Organization. This is\r\ncontrary to the proposal made at the Harare summit\r\nthat Africa be granted two permanent seats in the\r\nCouncil in a manner commensurate with the size of its\r\nmembership.\r\nThe question of the veto is one of the most\r\ncontroversial issues with respect to the reform of the\r\nCouncil. It is no exaggeration to say that it has further\r\ncomplicated the work of the Council since the\r\nestablishment of the Organization. Since the first\r\ninstance of its use, it has become clear that it runs\r\ncounter to the principle of equal sovereignty among\r\nStates and to other principles contained in the Charter.\r\nIt does not promote democracy but undermines it. It\r\naccords a privilege to some, who then use it in the\r\nservice of their own interests and against the national\r\nand international interests of others.\r\nThis poses a challenge to the authority of the\r\nmajority of the Council. We believe that the use of the\r\nveto should be subject to approval by a two-thirds\r\nmajority of the membership of the General Assembly.\r\nWe believe also that Council reform will not be\r\ncomplete as long as the veto right is not eliminated.\r\nOnly a few Members of the United Nations will have\r\nthat right and will use it to impose their will on the rest\r\nof the world.\r\nA few days ago, the Secretary-General stated that\r\nno reform of the United Nations would be complete\r\nwithout the reform of the Security Council. Two years\r\nago, the Millennium Declaration called for the\r\nintensification of efforts to comprehensively reform the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects. This call should be\r\ntranslated into concrete action. It can become reality\r\nonly through the cooperation of all.\r\nWe hope that the upcoming meetings of the\r\nWorking Group on Council reform will give priority to\r\nthe key objectives of the Charter of the United Nations\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nin order further to democratize the Council and its\r\nwork.\r\nMr. Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I should like\r\nat the outset to extend my heartfelt condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Indonesia in the wake of\r\nthe tragic events that took place late last week.\r\nWe would all agree that the Security Council has\r\ndevoted most of its meetings and consultations to\r\nAfrica and its various political issues. We would also\r\nagree that the Council has amply demonstrated that it is\r\ncapable of bearing the heavy responsibility entrusted to\r\nit by the Member States for the maintenance of peace\r\nand security in the African continent. This has been\r\nmade clear in the efforts it has deployed in Sierra\r\nLeone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola,\r\nin Ethiopia and Eritrea and in other hotbeds of tension\r\nin the continent.\r\nThis gives us grounds for optimism and hope as\r\nto the Council’s determination to fulfil the tremendous\r\nresponsibility entrusted to it of settling armed conflicts\r\nin Africa and to use its political weight to support\r\nefforts for peace in Africa.\r\nAt the same time, proceeding from our collective\r\nwill to enhance the role of the Council in Africa and to\r\npromote a partnership between the Council, the\r\ncontinent and its regional and subregional\r\norganizations, we would like to stress three basic\r\npillars that should underline the Council’s approach to\r\nAfrican issues.\r\nFirst, an effort should be made to establish an\r\ninstitutionalized and regulated relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and African organizations in the field\r\nof conflict settlement and the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity in the continent. This relationship would keep\r\nthe Council abreast of the positions taken by the\r\nAfrican continent and take account of the limited\r\nmilitary, logistical and financial resources of the\r\ncontinent.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council’s responsibilities\r\nshould be extended to the other armed conflicts that are\r\ntearing the African continent asunder, not only those\r\nthat are of special interest to its influential members. It\r\nshould deal with all conflicts in the continent in an\r\nequitable manner that does not discriminate between\r\nthe various issues. That could be done by devoting\r\nincreased attention to the issues of Somalia, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic, Burundi, Liberia and others that\r\nhave not been given the same attention by the Council\r\nor the international community.\r\nThirdly, the Security Council’s response to\r\nconflicts in Africa should be commensurate with the\r\ndimension and complexity of those conflicts. That will\r\nrequire political will on the part of the Council that is\r\nequal to that shown in the case of Timor-Leste, Kosovo\r\nand other areas — areas that are not in Africa.\r\nPeacekeeping missions in the continent could also be\r\ngiven further attention and resources.\r\nFor more than a decade now, the General\r\nAssembly’s Working Group on reform and expansion\r\nof the membership of the Council has been doing very\r\nimportant work. We are committed to the position of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and of the African Union,\r\nand we have actively participated in both their working\r\ngroups on this issue. We would like in this regard to\r\nstress the elements included in the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Ethiopia with respect to the\r\nAfrican position on the expansion of the membership\r\nof the Council.\r\nAll of these working groups have deployed\r\ntireless efforts to reform the Council in the area of the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories and with\r\nregard to the veto right and other working methods of\r\nthe Council. However, any delay in the consideration\r\nof these issues should not be interpreted as acceptance\r\nby the General Assembly of the present form or\r\nworking methods of the Council. We believe, therefore,\r\nthat a number of steps should be taken in order to give\r\nthe expansion of the Council the high priority it\r\ndeserves.\r\nClosed meetings of the Council have become the\r\nrule, though they were intended to be the exception.\r\nThat affects the openness of the Council, since\r\ndecisions are taken during the closed consultations,\r\nwhile open meetings are held to enable the general\r\nmembership — whose influence on decision-making is\r\nnot clear — to express their views. Therefore, we\r\nrequest greater transparency in the methods of work of\r\nthe Council in its private meetings and in its closed\r\nconsultations.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council must take into\r\naccount the views of non-member States of the Council\r\nthat have a direct or indirect connection to a given\r\nissue, in particular when it comes to the imposition of\r\nmeasures against another State, in accordance with\r\nArticle 51 of the Charter. That Article has been ignored\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nfor too long. It is applicable and should be resorted to,\r\nand we believe that the time has come to do so.\r\nThirdly, the Security Council should further seek\r\nout the specific opinions of the general membership\r\nwhen discussing any important issue. That would add\r\nto the practicality, credibility and applicability of any\r\ndecision taken by the Council.\r\nFourthly, the Council should address all threats to\r\ninternational peace and security on an equal footing.\r\nCertain international issues should enjoy greater\r\nattention from the Council, which we have seen hasten\r\nto deal with one particular question while ignoring\r\nothers that may pose a greater threat to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nFifthly, all Security Council resolutions should be\r\nimplemented with equal rigour. Some are implemented\r\nimmediately and to the letter, while others seem to be\r\nignored by the Council or by any State that may be\r\ninvolved in their implementation. We in the Middle\r\nEast have many examples to invoke in this regard.\r\nSixthly, with respect to the Council’s working\r\nmethods and the follow-up to its recommendations, the\r\nCouncil took a commendable step in establishing a\r\nPanel of Experts last July to submit an independent\r\nreport on the violations of the arms embargo against\r\nSomalia. A similar step should be taken with regard to\r\nthe grave violations of international humanitarian law\r\ncommitted in the occupied Palestinian territories.\r\nThe Open-ended Working Group has held only\r\nsix meetings over the course of the entire year. This,\r\nwe believe, will not lead to the further progress that we\r\nall expect on the Council.\r\nMr. Yuchengco (Philippines): Through you, Sir,\r\nallow me to thank the Permanent Representative of\r\nCameroon and President of the Security Council for\r\nthis month, Ambassador Belinga-Eboutou, for\r\nintroducing this year’s report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe Philippines also wishes to extend its deepest\r\ncondolences to the Government and people of\r\nIndonesia over the despicable terrorist attack this past\r\nweekend, which took the lives of so many. Our\r\ncondolences go, too, to the other Governments and\r\nfamilies that also lost loved ones in the attack.\r\nThe General Assembly, which is the only United\r\nNations organ that receives reports from the other\r\nprincipal organs, including that of the Security\r\nCouncil, must effectively seize this opportunity each\r\nsession to comment on and assess the Security\r\nCouncil’s work and decisions during the period\r\ncovered by its annual report.\r\nAs a whole, we find the present annual report\r\nmore concise and more organized than previous ones.\r\nWe congratulate the Council on the changes made to\r\nthe report’s format and we welcome the new format,\r\nwhich provides more substantive details and\r\ninformation. We further welcome the inclusion of an\r\nanalytical portion on the activities of the Council in the\r\nintroduction segment of the report. Perhaps that section\r\ncould be expanded in future reports.\r\nWe also note the deletion of the descriptive list of\r\nall decisions, resolutions and presidential statements\r\nfor the one-year period preceding the period covered\r\nby the current report, and we are pleased that the report\r\nno longer includes the verbatim account of the\r\ndiscussions on each subject dealt with by the Council\r\nduring the period under consideration.\r\nThese changes, at the very least, make it easier\r\nfor the general membership to gain a clearer\r\nappreciation of the activities and decisions of the\r\nCouncil. Nevertheless, it might also be useful for the\r\nCouncil to consider submitting, from time to time each\r\nyear, special reports, as referred to in Article 15 of the\r\nCharter, so as to keep the General Assembly abreast of\r\nthe Council’s work. For example, the period of the\r\npresent report goes up to 31 July 2002. A supplemental\r\nspecial report covering the period from, say, 1 August\r\nto 1 October would also have been useful.\r\nRegarding the observation of delegations in\r\nprevious debates on this item that the Council’s report\r\nis not analytical, but a mere compendium of documents\r\nand activities undertaken by the Council, my\r\ndelegation shares the view that an analytical report\r\nwould be virtually impossible, given the highly\r\npoliticized and controversial nature of many issues\r\nconsidered by the Security Council. As my delegation\r\nhas stated before, we believe that the analysis and\r\nassessment of the issues in the report are the\r\nresponsibility of the States members of the General\r\nAssembly. It is up to us to assess what is contained in\r\nthe report.\r\nWe are pleased to note from the report that the\r\nyear under review was marked by significant events,\r\nhighlighted by, among other things, the Council’s\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\naction on terrorism, the successful completion of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission of Support in East Timor\r\n(UNMISET), the launching of the Bonn process and its\r\non-track implementation in Afghanistan, and the peace\r\nprocess and successful elections in Sierra Leone. While\r\nthere are an abundant number of issues covered by the\r\nreport, in view of the limited time, allow me to\r\ncomment on just some.\r\nWe commend the efforts of the Council in\r\nfighting terrorism. In particular, we support the work of\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee, which we note has\r\nmade considerable progress over the past year. The\r\nPhilippines is committed to supporting the work of the\r\nCommittee, particularly its programme on technical\r\nassistance. We also believe that to enhance more\r\neffective implementation by States of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), the provision of technical\r\nassistance would be more than helpful.\r\nWe recognize the significant role of the Council\r\nin the establishment of UNMISET, which led to the full\r\nindependence of East Timor. As we celebrate the birth\r\nof that new nation, we join other nations in welcoming\r\nTimor-Leste as the newest Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe Security Council has a crucial role to play in\r\nfinding an effective solution to the Middle East\r\nconflict, and we believe it must continue to do so. My\r\ndelegation views the recently adopted declaration of\r\nthe Quartet, specifying its three-phase solution to\r\nrealize the vision of two States living side by side in\r\nsecure borders, as a positive development. We would,\r\nhowever, emphasize that the international community\r\ncannot impose peace. The success of the Quartet\r\nformula rests on the parties concerned. We reiterate\r\nthat there is no military solution to the Middle East\r\nconflict. The way forward is through political\r\nnegotiations.\r\nThe Security Council’s consideration of the issue\r\nof small arms is important and should complement the\r\nefforts of the General Assembly, as well as national\r\nand regional activities.\r\nOn the working methods of the Council, we\r\nbelieve that a number of improvements have been\r\nmade over the past few years in order to increase\r\ntransparency and greater participation by non-\r\nmembers. Nevertheless, the Council’s procedures and\r\nthe recent positive innovations in its working methods\r\nremain provisional and ad hoc in nature. The Council\r\nmight wish to heed the Secretary-General’s suggestion\r\nin his agenda for further change (A/57/387) that the\r\nCouncil consider codifying its recent changes. One way\r\nto do that would be to adopt definitively its provisional\r\nrules of procedures and annex its recent innovations to\r\nthe rules. We also support more dialogue between the\r\nrepresentatives of the Council and the General\r\nAssembly’s Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and related issues. Such\r\nmeetings have proven to be useful and a good way for\r\nthe Council and General Assembly to have an\r\ninteractive exchange on a broad range of issues.\r\nWe find the Council’s thematic debates very\r\nuseful, and they should be continued. Nevertheless, we\r\nbelieve they should also aim at some action-oriented\r\nobjective over a medium-term period. The Council’s\r\nthematic debates should also be synchronized with\r\ndebates on the same issues in the General Assembly, in\r\norder to link the decisions and appropriate policy\r\nactions taken by the Council and the Assembly on\r\nthese issues. One such issue that comes to mind is the\r\nprevention of armed conflict. Linking outcomes would\r\nalso be a step towards more interaction between the\r\nCouncil and the Assembly.\r\nIn the coming years, my delegation looks forward\r\nto a more substantive consideration by the Assembly of\r\nthe report of the Council, not necessarily of the whole\r\nreport but at least of certain issues addressed in it. In\r\nthat regard, it is suggested that the President identify\r\nspecific issues for more intensive discussion. That\r\nshould be done while taking into account Article 12\r\nand in a more informal format, such as informal\r\nconsultations or round tables. The discussions should\r\naim at reaching a specific outcome such as a decision,\r\na chairman’s summary or simply an aide-memoire of\r\nthe discussion. This approach would, in our view, be in\r\nline with the intent of earlier resolutions on the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. The issues\r\nselected could be country-specific or could be among\r\nthe thematic matters considered by the Council.\r\nRegarding the agenda item on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, the Philippines is committed to\r\npromoting agreement on measures aimed at achieving a\r\nmore open and transparent decision-making process in\r\nthe Security Council, as well as on finding an\r\nacceptable compromise on the expansion in the number\r\nof permanent and non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nAs we enter the tenth year of our exercise on the\r\nreform of the Security Council, we remain deadlocked\r\non the issue of new permanent members. The Open-\r\nended Working Group has had some influence in\r\ninitiating positive reforms in the working methods of\r\nthe Council, including more open meetings, regular\r\nbriefings and improved arrangements for consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries. We therefore believe\r\nthat this session of the work of the Group should focus\r\non the main outstanding issues of expansion, while\r\npreserving the tentative agreements reached on\r\ncluster II issues relating to the Council’s working\r\nmethods.\r\nFinally, we are prepared to support all efforts\r\naimed at reaching a comprehensive package agreement\r\nconsisting of measures relating to the expansion of the\r\nCouncil’s membership and to enhancing the\r\ntransparency of the Council’s working methods.\r\nMr. Sun (Republic of Korea): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to convey my delegation’s deep\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families of those killed in\r\nthe bomb attack in Indonesia last weekend. We also\r\nwish a speedy recovery to those injured as a result of\r\nthat attack. We condemn acts of terrorism targeting\r\ninnocent civilians and reaffirm our commitment to join\r\nthe rest of international community in fighting such\r\nterrorist acts.\r\nAs we have noted, this year’s report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/57/2) contains many\r\nimprovements over previous reports. It is more cost-\r\neffective thanks to the reduction in the size of the\r\nreport. With the introduction of an analytical overview,\r\nit also gives a clearer picture of the Council’s work.\r\nSuch progress in the format of the report is a welcome\r\nresponse to long-standing requests from the wider\r\nmembership of the United Nations. We believe that\r\nthese efforts on the part of the Security Council to\r\nmake its report a more in-depth account of its work\r\nshould be continued and further strengthened.\r\nLet me now briefly review the Council’s work\r\nover the past year. The period under consideration,\r\nfrom June 2001 to July 2002, was indeed a unique and\r\nbusy time. Among other things, the terrorist attacks of\r\n11 September 2001, for whose gravity no precedent\r\nexists, changed our perception of the world. As the\r\ninternational community swiftly realized the imperative\r\nneed to stand together in the face of such global\r\nthreats, the Security Council rose to the occasion by\r\nreinforcing the resolve of the international community\r\nand by enhancing its readiness to take united action.\r\nThe adoption of resolution 1373 (2001) and the\r\nsubsequent establishment of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee clearly demonstrated how the international\r\ncommunity, under the guidance of the Security\r\nCouncil, can act in partnership and solidarity in the\r\nfight against a common security threat.\r\nWith regard to regional matters, the cases of\r\nAfghanistan and East Timor stand out as successful\r\nmissions. With well-planned engagement and\r\nassistance, as set out in the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, both countries have made remarkable\r\nprogress towards stability and democracy. The\r\nRepublic of Korea has been actively engaged in the\r\nefforts of the international community in this regard,\r\nincluding by providing humanitarian assistance and\r\nlogistical and other support.\r\nMr. Santa Clara Gomes (Portugal), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIn the Middle East, there seems to be no respite in\r\nviolence and strife. The loss of civilian lives and the\r\ndeterioration in the humanitarian situation in the region\r\nare of profound concern. There have been both\r\nachievements and setbacks in the Council’s work to\r\naddress these challenges. However, what is important\r\nis that the Security Council has laid down crucial\r\ngroundwork for peace in the Middle East by setting out\r\nin its resolution 1397 (2001) a vision of two States\r\nliving side by side within secure and recognized\r\nborders. We truly hope that the efforts of the\r\ninternational community, particularly those of the\r\n“Quartet”, to bring lasting peace to the region will\r\nsucceed in achieving a positive outcome within the\r\nframework of the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWith regard to Africa, it has been encouraging to\r\nnote the cessation of some civil and inter-State\r\nconflicts. Though peace in many parts of the continent\r\nstill remains fragile, such developments as the holding\r\nof elections in Sierra Leone and peace agreements\r\nrelating to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nAngola certainly give us cause for optimism and hope.\r\nThe role of the Security Council, including its mandate\r\nof peacekeeping and peace-building missions, is\r\nindispensable to these endeavours. Noteworthy, too, is\r\nthe Council’s renewed attention to the region with the\r\nestablishment of the Ad hoc Working Group on Africa\r\nduring the year.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nMy delegation also values the work of the\r\nSecurity Council in Europe and other parts of the\r\nworld, as well as its continued engagement with the\r\nissues of protecting civilians, especially women and\r\nchildren in armed conflicts.\r\nLet me now turn to the working methods of the\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation’s basic approach to\r\nthis matter, perhaps shared by many other delegations,\r\nis that the views and observations of the wider\r\nmembership of the United Nations should be duly\r\nreflected in the work of the Security Council. In this\r\never-globalizing world, few international issues of\r\npeace and security remain isolated in scope and\r\nseriousness. As the issue of counter-terrorism most\r\ncompellingly shows, the matters before the Council\r\nhave far-reaching implications and consequences for\r\nnearly all corners of the world. Transparency in the\r\nwork of the Council and the substantial contributions\r\nby its non-members are two sides of the same coin,\r\nsince, without comprehensive knowledge of the\r\nCouncil’s work, the non-member States can hardly\r\nmake meaningful contributions. Stronger and wider\r\nparticipation by non-members in the Council\r\ndiscussions would also further enhance the authority of\r\nthe Council in implementing its resolutions.\r\nIn this regard, the increasing frequency of public\r\nmeetings and briefings in the Security Council is a\r\nwelcome development. The way that the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee has worked, offering regular\r\nbriefings by its chairman, is an example to be\r\nemulated. However, the challenge ahead lies in the fact\r\nthat confidentiality still serves as the norm rather than\r\nthe exception in the work of the Council and that there\r\nexists great inconsistency in the openness and\r\ntransparency, from month to month and from\r\ncommittee to committee.\r\nMy delegation believes that further efforts should\r\nbe made to find ways and means to enhance openness,\r\ntransparency and efficiency in the working methods of\r\nthe Security Council. We would like to suggest that the\r\npublic meetings of the Council, particularly those on\r\nthematic issues, be conducted in a more focused\r\nmanner, by narrowing the scope of subject under\r\ndiscussion, thereby enabling the Council’s discussions\r\nto be more action-oriented.\r\nOther measures might include the\r\ninstitutionalization of post-meeting briefings and\r\ntimely dissemination of the results of meetings,\r\nincluding those of the sanctions committees. With\r\nregard to post-meeting briefings, we believe that the\r\noption of appointing a spokesperson, whose major role\r\nwould be to provide up-to-date briefings to non-\r\nmembers on the results of each meeting, merits serious\r\nconsideration.\r\nLet me now turn to the question of the reform of\r\nthe Security Council. First of all, while the slow pace\r\nof discussions and lack of tangible progress can be\r\nfrustrating, we should not attribute this stalemate to\r\nineffectiveness on the part of the Working Group;\r\nrather, it is a reflection of the tremendous significance\r\nand politically sensitive nature of this issue. My\r\ndelegation believes that the Working Group, the sole\r\nbody mandated by the General Assembly to discuss\r\nSecurity Council reforms, still remains the best forum\r\nfor addressing the issue.\r\nSecondly, the reform of the Security Council,\r\nboth in its shape and in its decision-making process,\r\nshould be guided by democratic principles and should\r\nreflect our current reality. The two major questions —\r\nthe enlargement of the Council and the decision-\r\nmaking procedures — are inextricably linked and are\r\ntherefore best considered in a single context.\r\nThirdly, as we have witnessed, a growing number\r\nof States have been playing an increasingly active role\r\nin the work of the United Nations and have become\r\nindispensable to the maintenance and promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security. In spite of these\r\ndevelopments, only a handful of Member States are\r\ngiven the opportunity to fully participate in the work of\r\nthe Security Council. This discrepancy lies at the heart\r\nof our efforts to reform the Security Council. In light of\r\nthis situation, a greater effort must be made to find\r\nways to provide as many countries as possible with the\r\nopportunity to serve on the Council on a more frequent\r\nbasis.\r\nI would like to reiterate my Government’s view\r\nthat an increase in the number of non-permanent seats\r\nalone is a viable option under the circumstances. This\r\nwould allow more members to be elected for regular\r\nterms, thereby making the Council more representative\r\nand accountable.\r\nFinally, cooperation among the whole of the\r\nUnited Nations membership will be needed to\r\nsurmount the daunting challenges ahead of us. In this\r\ncontext, it is critical that the reform of the Security\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nCouncil be carried out in a way that unites Member\r\nStates.\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to\r\nthe next speaker, I would like to remind Members that\r\nthe General Committee will meet tomorrow morning,\r\nTuesday, 15 October, at 9.30 in Conference Room 4.\r\nThe agenda for the meeting can be found in today’s\r\nJournal.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of\r\nSpain.\r\nMr. Arias (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): First of all,\r\nI would like to express my condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of Indonesia and to the family\r\nmembers of all the victims of the terrible terrorist\r\nattack, a scourge of the twenty-first century.\r\nSecondly, I would like to thank all the Members\r\nof the United Nations for supporting Spain’s candidacy\r\nto one of the non-permanent member seats of the\r\nSecurity Council for the coming biennium. I also want\r\nto thank the representative of Cameroon, the current\r\nPresident of the Security Council, for presenting this\r\nreport.\r\nThe Foreign Minister of Spain, in her speech in\r\nthe General Assembly in September, said that our\r\ncountry would, during its tenure, work in favour of\r\ntransparency and greater openness of the Council. It is\r\nundeniable that progress has been made in improving\r\nthe working methods of the Council in recent times; for\r\nexample, the increase in the number of public\r\nmeetings, which are open to participation to all non-\r\nmembers who wish to attend, and the innovative\r\npractice introduced by some members of the Council to\r\nhold the so-called wrap-up meetings at the end of their\r\npresidency. Another interesting example is that of the\r\nmeetings in the last two years of the Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council Reform with representatives of the\r\nCouncil members in order to discuss aspects of\r\nworking methods.\r\nAlso with respect to achievements, we should\r\nunderline the excellent reform to the format and\r\ncontent of the annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly, now under consideration.\r\nNumerous delegations, including mine, have spoken in\r\nfavour of a less voluminous report that is easier for the\r\nuser, more analytical and more transparent. The\r\nreport — we are delighted to say — has improved\r\nconsiderably and better corresponds to the wishes\r\nexpressed by many Member States. We wish to thank\r\nthe members of the Council for the work carried out,\r\nwith a special mention for Ambassador Mahbubani.\r\nDespite the achievements, the reality is that the\r\nCouncil continues to favour closed meetings — the\r\nconsultations — and the semi-closed meetings, the so-\r\ncalled private meetings. My delegation has\r\ntraditionally argued that the consultations should be\r\nreduced to the minimum number necessary and that an\r\neffort should be made to clarify the modalities and\r\ncriteria for the participation of non-member States in\r\nthe private meetings.\r\nThe question of working methods is not a futile\r\ndiscussion. We are convinced that one of the ways to\r\nmake the Security Council more effective lies in\r\ncarrying improvements in this area further.\r\nAs has been noted on various occasions,\r\nincluding at the Millennium Summit, the great majority\r\nof Members of the Organization desire a reform of the\r\nSecurity Council that will make it a more efficient and\r\nmore participative organ. A reform of that kind can be\r\ncarried out only if there is consensus on the elements\r\nsuch a reform consists of. The Millennium Declaration\r\nechoes this need when it calls on all to carry out a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. The clarity of the Declaration is obvious and\r\ncompletely excludes any partial focus. Unfortunately,\r\nwe are still far from reaching consensus on the various\r\naspects of reform, and, therefore, discussions in the\r\nWorking Group of the General Assembly should\r\ncontinue.\r\nOne of the key aspects of reform is the decision-\r\nmaking process in the Council, including the veto. The\r\nquestion of the veto is an essential aspect of Council\r\nreform. It is of prime importance. The great majority of\r\nStates unhesitatingly wish that this unparalleled\r\ninstrument of power be eliminated or — if nothing\r\nelse — reduced in scope.\r\nHowever, we know that our ambition is somewhat\r\nillusory. Those possessing the veto power are unlikely\r\nto surrender it, even partially. We also know that the\r\nstatus of permanent member is inexorably linked to the\r\nveto power. Bearing that in mind, an obvious question\r\nmust once more be asked: do we realize — in 2002, 57\r\nyears after the last war — what it would mean to\r\nincrease the number of permanent members, based on\r\nmore than debatable criteria, in addition to granting\r\nthem the all-powerful prerogative of being able to veto\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nany resolution of the Council? Can we, today,\r\ncollectively and bitterly lament that the United Nations\r\nhas been prevented from acting because the vote of a\r\nsingle member has paralyzed it, and then tomorrow\r\ngrant that same paralyzing power to another handful of\r\nchosen States?\r\nThe veto is a crucial element of reform, in\r\nparticular as it relates to an increase in the\r\nmembership. When, in the twenty-first century, there is\r\na demand among Members to abolish an existing\r\npower, it is, to say the least, strange that we should\r\ngrant that power to yet another group of countries.\r\nAside from acting paradoxically, we would be creating\r\na new class of privileged States, poorly serving the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): I cannot begin\r\ntoday without expressing to the Indonesian authorities\r\nour profound shock and grief at what happened in Bali.\r\nWe condemn the bombing in the strongest terms. Our\r\nthoughts and prayers are with those families who have\r\nlost their loved ones.\r\nWe owe sincere thanks to Ambassador Martin\r\nBelinga-Eboutou for his presentation of the annual\r\nreport of the Security Council (A/57/2).\r\nThis year’s report, as has been stated, marks a\r\nnotable improvement in trying to be more than just a\r\nreference document. We view the editorial changes\r\nfavourably. We would suggest further rationalization of\r\nthe contents through the elimination of all sections\r\ncontaining records of meetings and catalogues of\r\ndocuments. If deemed necessary, a separate volume,\r\nwhich would not duplicate the repertoire, could be\r\nconsidered.\r\nThe objective of this debate is to exchange\r\ninformation, to share views and to deliberate on policy\r\norientation on international peace and security. In that\r\ncontext, we find the introduction to the report of\r\nparticular interest. It is a laudable initiative.\r\nNevertheless, it falls short of what the general\r\nmembership has long been asking for. The introduction\r\ndoes not go beyond what we read in individual\r\npresidential assessment reports.\r\nWhile on the Council, Bangladesh had wished for\r\na report that would serve the purpose of a dialogue\r\nbetween the Council and the Assembly. The idea we\r\npursued was to have a substantive report that would\r\npresent an analysis of issues before the Council, the\r\ndifficulties confronted in resolving ongoing conflicts,\r\nthe challenges of prevention and the tasks of peace-\r\nbuilding.\r\nTo that end, we suggested that the report include,\r\napart from information and analysis, specific\r\nrecommendations on the implementation of its\r\nresolutions and decisions. The Council has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. It cannot discharge that\r\nresponsibility alone. Given the complexity of today’s\r\nconflicts and other threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, the Council’s efforts require the support of the\r\nAssembly and other organs, funds, programmes and\r\nagencies. The Bretton Woods institutions, regional and\r\nsubregional organizations, the non-governmental\r\norganizations and the private sector are also important\r\nplayers and stakeholders. There is need, and certainly\r\nthe scope, to further strengthen cooperation and\r\ncoordination with those stakeholders.\r\nThe decisions of the Security Council affect\r\nMember States. We would have liked the Council to\r\ntell us, for instance, about non-compliance with its\r\nresolutions, the violation of sanctions and the impact of\r\nsanctions on third countries.\r\nFor the next session, we would expect the\r\nPresident of the Security Council to present a\r\nsubstantive report — just like the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization —\r\nhighlighting the issues the Council addressed over the\r\nreporting year, presenting the challenges ahead and\r\ncalling for the specific support required for\r\nimplementation of its resolutions and decisions. The\r\nreport should cover the period from October to\r\nSeptember, given that the Security Council report is\r\nconsidered in mid-October.\r\nLet me share some of our specific ideas and\r\nconcerns with regard to the Council’s functioning.\r\nFirst, with respect to the Council’s relationship with the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil: as we have suggested on other occasions, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council could hold\r\nquarterly meetings for review of the implementation of\r\nCouncil decisions. The areas of cooperation and\r\ncoordination might be identified and worked out by\r\ntheir respective offices in coordination with the\r\nSecretariat. The General Assembly President might\r\nhave with him five members of his Bureau representing\r\nthe five electoral groups. The Security Council\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nPresident likewise might have five members\r\nrepresenting five electoral groups. A similar\r\ninstitutional arrangement might be envisaged for\r\ncoordination with the Economic and Social Council.\r\nSecondly, as regards openness and participation,\r\nCouncil meetings should be held in public or private\r\nformats, depending on the need for confidentiality. The\r\nuse of informal consultations should be restricted to\r\nexceptionally sensitive cases. When the agenda item so\r\nrequires, the Council should meet with the active\r\nparticipation of non-members and other stakeholders,\r\nthe United Nations funds, programmes and agencies\r\nand the Bretton Woods institutions, in their\r\ndeliberations. Further ways and means should be\r\nexplored to involve non-governmental organizations in\r\nthe Council’s work. We have supported increased\r\nrecourse to orientation debates for the purpose. The\r\nCouncil might hold more Arria-formula meetings to\r\nexchange views with civil society organizations,\r\nincluding non-governmental organizations and think\r\ntanks.\r\nThirdly, on the Council’s relationship with troop-\r\ncontributing countries, we note with regret the\r\ncontinuation of the practice of pro forma meetings.\r\nBangladesh proposed the holding of periodic meetings\r\nbetween the Council and the troop-contributing\r\ncountries, instead of the last-minute pro forma\r\nmeetings called generally prior to renewal of\r\npeacekeeping mandates. Such meetings convened\r\nunder the terms of Council resolutions 1327 (2000) and\r\n1353 (2001) would be important for sustained\r\nexchange, review of implementation of the mandate of\r\nmissions and discussion of any difficulties faced by the\r\nmissions. These periodic meetings would allow for\r\nbetter reflection of the concerns and positions of troop-\r\ncontributing countries in Council decisions.\r\nFourthly, we recognize the extremely valuable\r\ncontribution made by groups of friends in drafting\r\nCouncil resolutions. In the current practice, Council\r\nmembers not represented on any of these groups are\r\nvirtually excluded from the decision-making process.\r\nThere should be an official list, with the composition of\r\nthe various groups of friends, however informal they\r\nmay be. The list of the groups of friends should be\r\nposted on the United Nations web site.\r\nFifthly, on relating procedural improvements to\r\nsubstantive action, besides the specific suggestions, we\r\nhave stressed the need to relate procedural reforms to\r\nthose of substance. First, the Council should function\r\nin such a way as not to invite the criticism of “doing\r\ntoo little, too late” as has, at times, been the case. The\r\nCouncil should be proactive rather then reactive, as has\r\nsadly been the case in recent times. The Council should\r\naddress issues more on the basis of developments\r\nrather than as calendar events determined by the\r\nsubmission of reports or expiry of mandates.\r\nWe note with satisfaction a positive evolution in\r\nthe Council’s perception of peace and security. The\r\nchallenge of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity is increasingly recognized as a continuing\r\nprocess requiring a comprehensive approach and\r\ninvolving all stakeholders.\r\nFinally, on the issue of expansion, Bangladesh\r\nshares the position taken by the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. We hold the view that both reform and\r\nexpansion of the Security Council should be considered\r\nas integral parts of a common package. We support an\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council by\r\nnot less than 11, based on the principles of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution and sovereign equality of\r\nStates.\r\nThe objective of reform remains to enhance\r\ntransparency, accountability and democratization in the\r\ndecision-making process of the Security Council. We\r\nare not in favour of any partial or selective expansion\r\nor enlargement of the membership to the detriment of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe also believe that the Council should function\r\nmore as a rule-based organ in accordance with Charter\r\nprovisions. The principle and the objective of\r\ncollective security should be upheld in its action in\r\nevery case.\r\nAll these principles have been stated time and\r\nagain. But the process remains stalled in the Working\r\nGroup. The United Nations has accomplished\r\nsignificant reforms in past years. After his track 1 and\r\ntrack 2 reforms, the Secretary-General has launched a\r\nfurther programme of revitalization and rationalization\r\nof the Organization. The process will remain\r\nincomplete without reform of the Security Council. It\r\nis time we thought of ways and means to engage in\r\nserious negotiations on core issues and lead the reform\r\nprocess to a conclusion.\r\nBangladesh attaches the greatest importance to\r\nthe peace and security mission of the Organization and\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nthe role of the Security Council in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We have made every\r\neffort to contribute to that mission. We have\r\ndemonstrated our commitment by extending the fullest\r\ncooperation to the Council, by contributing to positive,\r\nproactive and constructive decision-making directly as\r\na member in 2000 and 2001, and by contributing troops\r\nand other personnel to United Nations peace\r\noperations, irrespective of risks and uncertainties.\r\nThe overarching goal of reform and expansion of\r\nthe Security Council for us is to make the Council\r\nmore balanced, representative and effective. There\r\nhave been major breaches of the peace across the world\r\nin the past two decades. The Security Council has not\r\nalways been effective. It has remained stymied. It has\r\nbeen accused of employing double standards. There\r\nhave been wars between, but mostly within, States. The\r\nhumanitarian consequences in each case, though\r\ndiffering in extent and magnitude, have been appalling.\r\nThe impact on the economies of the affected countries,\r\nalmost all of them developing nations, has been\r\ndisastrous. The cost of these wars for third countries\r\nand, in general, for the international community has\r\nalso been enormous.\r\nAll these conflicts have been senseless. All these\r\nexpenditures could, and should, have been avoided. It\r\nshould be our common endeavour to pursue the\r\nCharter’s objective of employing “international\r\nmachinery for the promotion of the economic and\r\nsocial advancement of all peoples”.\r\nBut when a sizeable portion of global resources is\r\nspent on armed conflicts, this aim remains seriously\r\njeopardized. If the Security Council fails to address this\r\nphenomenon, the vision of the founding fathers of this\r\nOrganization will remain unrealized.\r\nMr. Listre (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nFirstly, I wish to express condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of Indonesia for the savage\r\nterrorist attack that took place in Bali on 2 October,\r\nwhich we condemn most vigorously.\r\nThis year we have decided to have a joint debate\r\nof the annual report of the Security Council to the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the question of reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. It is the right thing to do, because\r\nboth subjects have a common denominator that, I think,\r\nis an objective all of us here share — namely, to have a\r\nmore transparent Security Council in its working\r\nmethods, more representative in its composition, more\r\ndemocratic in its decision-making process and more\r\naccountable to the rest of the United Nations\r\nmembership for its actions.\r\nAmbassador Belinga-Eboutou of Cameroon, in\r\nhis capacity as President of the Security Council,\r\nintroduced the Council’s report, contained in document\r\nA/57/2. Here we want to emphasize an important\r\npositive point — last year’s debate was not in vain; the\r\nCouncil adopted a receptive and positive attitude. It\r\ntook into account the Assembly’s criticism concerning\r\nthe format and substance of the report and produced a\r\nshorter and more useful one. In this respect, we want to\r\npraise the role played by the non-permanent members,\r\nand in particular, Singapore and its Permanent\r\nRepresentative, my friend, the indefatigable and\r\nintelligent Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani. It is also\r\nworth noting that, for the first time, the report contains\r\nan introduction with an analytical summary. In this\r\nrespect, we appreciate the contribution made by the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\nThere is no doubt that the report can and should\r\nbe improved. For the most part, it continues to be a\r\nformal description of events that does little justice to\r\nthe substantive work carried out by the Council.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that a first step has been taken\r\nin the right direction. That step should be encouraged.\r\nWith regard to transparency, we are grateful to\r\nthe Secretariat for the preparation of document\r\nS/2002/603, which illustrates the positive development\r\nin the working methods of the Council during the past\r\nfew years. In this connection, we support the\r\nsuggestion made by the Secretary-General in his report\r\non the strengthening of the United Nations (A/57/387)\r\nconcerning codification of those practices. Contrary to\r\nthe views expressed by some permanent members\r\nduring the public meeting of 26 September, we do not\r\nbelieve that such codification would work against\r\npragmatism and dynamism in the Council’s work. On\r\nthe contrary, it would improve the legal soundness of\r\nprocedures and contribute to diminishing the margin\r\nfor discretion, especially that of the permanent\r\nmembers. Those members constitute the sole repository\r\nof the Council’s institutional memory and, on more\r\nthan one occasion, have invoked precedents that the\r\nnon-permanent members are at a loss to recall. We\r\nbelieve that, after 57 years, it is time for the Council’s\r\nrules of procedure to cease being provisional.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nThere is no doubt that there has been progress.\r\nToday we have a Council that is a little more\r\ntransparent than it was 10 years ago. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is still a long way to go. As the report itself\r\npoints out, most of the Council’s substantive work\r\ntakes place in informal consultations. Public meetings\r\ntherefore serve as a rubber stamp for what is negotiated\r\nand agreed upon behind closed doors. Having said that,\r\nwe are aware of the fact that informal consultations are\r\na reality in the work of the Council. Faced with that\r\nreality, we must act, first to reduce the number of\r\ninformal consultations and, secondly, to allow access to\r\nconsultations, under specific circumstances, to a State\r\nparty to a conflict that is not a member of the Council.\r\nWe believe that Articles 31 and 32 of the Charter\r\nprovide an adequate legal basis for doing so. The\r\nparticipation of interested States should not hinder the\r\nCouncil’s decision-making process. On the contrary, it\r\nwould increase the transparency and political\r\nlegitimacy of the decisions adopted by the Council.\r\nAlso with regard to the issue of informal\r\nconsultations, we would like to recall the Argentine\r\nproposal put forth in the note by the President of the\r\nCouncil (S/2000/155), which was issued on 28\r\nFebruary 2000. That proposal would invite newly\r\nelected members to participate in the Council’s\r\ninformal consultations during the month immediately\r\npreceding their term of membership. That proposal\r\nwould guarantee greater transparency and make it\r\npossible for new members to acquaint themselves with\r\nthe Council’s practices in informal consultations.\r\nThe last few weeks have done little to contribute\r\nto transparency in the Council. We have all witnessed\r\nhow discussions about issues crucial to international\r\npeace and security that affect basic principles of\r\ninternational law, and that may seriously affect the very\r\nexistence of the United Nations, take place exclusively\r\namong the permanent members of the Council. It seems\r\nthat the elected members of the Council and the rest of\r\nus only have the right to be informed through the\r\nnewspapers. We have recently read that proposals have\r\nbeen made to include in the text of a resolution an\r\nunacceptable and discriminatory distinction between\r\nthe powers of permanent and elected members,\r\nsomething that runs counter to the letter and the spirit\r\nof the Charter.\r\nWe would not like to conclude this part of our\r\nstatement on the working methods of the Council on a\r\nnegative note. We would therefore like to point to two\r\npositive developments. First, we are pleased with the\r\nfollow-up received by the initiative launched by the\r\ndelegations of Argentina and New Zealand in 1994 to\r\ninstitutionalize the meetings with the troop-\r\ncontributing countries. Resolution 1353 (2001) has\r\npaved the way for a more substantive dialogue.\r\nIn the context of the Council’s work in the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, we would like to highlight the\r\ntransparency and efficiency of the work done by\r\nAmbassador Greenstock of the United Kingdom in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Committee established by\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), and by Ambassador Valdivieso\r\nof Colombia in his capacity as Chairman of the\r\nCommittee established by resolution 1267 (1999).\r\nAfter nine years of deliberations, we have still not\r\nachieved the progress desired with regard to the veto\r\nand to increasing the membership of the Council. Like\r\nthe overwhelming majority of Member States,\r\nArgentina is opposed to the veto. The veto is an\r\ninstitution that runs contrary to the principle of\r\nsovereign equality among States. We are nevertheless\r\nrealistic enough to know that the elimination of the\r\nveto will not be accepted in the medium term. That is\r\nwhy we propose a functional and reasonable limitation\r\nof the veto that includes restricting its use to situations\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter. In our opinion, such\r\nlimitations should be established through amendments\r\nto the Charter. A political commitment would not\r\nprovide sufficient legal guarantees. Even a unilateral\r\nlegal declaration to restrict the use of the veto would\r\nfail to prevail over the provisions of Article 103 of the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe have said on numerous occasions that the\r\nreform of the Security Council is a “package deal”. We\r\ntherefore cannot artificially separate proposals by, for\r\nexample, putting off the issue of the veto and\r\ndiscussing only the matter of expansion, under the\r\npretext that the veto has not been used much since the\r\nend of the cold war and that it does not represent a\r\nreform priority at the moment. Our recent experience in\r\nthe Council does not support that conclusion. On the\r\ncontrary, it shows that the veto or the threat of veto is a\r\nrelevant political tool. That is the reason for the\r\nreluctance to change on the part of permanent\r\nmembers. There is no doubt that issues of expansion\r\nand of the power of the veto are closely linked, given\r\nthat it is clear that it is not possible to take a decision\r\non the enlargement of a body of such political\r\nimportance as the Council without a previous\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nagreement on the decision-making process of that body.\r\nThat is why the real reason for the delay in the reform\r\nof the Council is clear: it lies within an obstructionist\r\nminority that opposes any limitation of the veto, and\r\nnot in the vast majority of States that want a more\r\ndemocratic and representative Council.\r\nWe believe that we should not perpetuate the\r\ninequalities of the past by establishing new permanent\r\nseats following the model of 1945, namely, members\r\nthat are not accountable to the rest of the membership\r\nand that enjoy the privilege of the veto. Doing so\r\nwould further augment existing inequalities. It would\r\nalso be tantamount to ignoring the march of history and\r\nwould imperil the right of every Member State to elect\r\nand be elected to participate in the system of collective\r\nsecurity. Quite frankly, in nine years of discussion we\r\nhave not heard any proposals to increase the number of\r\npermanent members that have not contradicted the\r\ndemocratic principles espoused by their sponsors in\r\ntheir own legal systems.\r\nI would like to repeat once again that Argentina\r\nonly supports increasing the number of non-permanent\r\nmembers. We believe such members should be elected\r\nin accordance with the criteria set out in Article 23,\r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter, namely, on the basis of\r\ntheir contribution to the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security and the principle of equitable\r\ngeographic distribution. We believe that those criteria\r\ncontinue to be in effect. Finally, we also think that it is\r\nup to regional groups to decide the allocation of the\r\nnew non-permanent seats created as a consequence of\r\nthe reform of the Council.\r\nI would not want to end my statement without\r\nconveying our congratulations to the newly elected\r\nmembers of the Council: Angola, Chile, Germany,\r\nSpain and Pakistan.\r\nMr. McIvor (New Zealand): May I add my\r\ndelegation’s condolences to the families of the victims\r\nof last weekend’s appalling terrorist attacks in Bali,\r\nwhich has left many killed and many more injured.\r\nThis a very tragic reminder of the global nature of the\r\nterrorist threat and the need equally of global\r\nresponses, something indeed that has been on the\r\nforefront of the Security Council’s action in the past\r\nyear.\r\nWe welcome the decision to combine the debate\r\non the annual report of the Security Council with that\r\non issues relating to its membership and working\r\nmethods. We hope that this will mean a more efficient\r\nuse of this Assembly’s time. More important, we see\r\nthis as a logical combination, since the two items are\r\ninextricably linked. In my delegation’s view the\r\nperformance and credibility of the Council depend\r\nmuch on how it is constituted and how it conducts its\r\nbusiness. Consideration of the report should play a key\r\nrole in our collective efforts to enhance the Council’s\r\ntransparency and effectiveness and hold it accountable.\r\nMy delegation joins others in welcoming the\r\nefforts that have been made this year to produce a more\r\nconcise, analytical and user-friendly annual report of\r\nthe Security Council. In this the Council has begun to\r\nrespond to calls made over the last few years for\r\nimprovements in this report. We have been seeking a\r\nreport that is substantive rather than formal, analytic\r\nrather than descriptive. In this regard, the commentary\r\nprovided in the eight-page introduction to this year’s\r\nannual report represents a move in the right direction.\r\nIt has been a remarkable year for the Council,\r\nincluding the response to terrorist attacks of September\r\nlast year, the substantially increased attention to the\r\nMiddle East, and the Council’s key role in international\r\naction on Afghanistan. The report’s introduction\r\nconveys a sense of the Council’s response to new and\r\ncontinuing challenges. We look forward to next year’s\r\nreport building on this by providing a fuller analysis of\r\nhow the Council has dealt with issues coming before\r\nit — what worked well, what didn’t work so well, and\r\nwhy. The report is the Council’s opportunity to address\r\nits universal constituency on vital issues of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nOn transparency and working methods, we\r\nwelcome the President’s note of May 2002 on\r\nprocedural developments. Indeed we would have\r\nthought that the President’s note contains information\r\nand comment that could usefully be incorporated in the\r\nannual report itself — the current section on these\r\nissues in the introduction is very brief. We fully\r\nsupport the suggestion that recent improvements in\r\nworking methods might be codified in some way.\r\nIn the past year there have been encouraging\r\ndevelopments to further enhance Member State\r\nconsultation with the Council, including a useful joint\r\nmeeting of the Open-ended Working Group and the\r\nCouncil to discuss workings methods. There have been\r\nmore open-ended meetings and wrap-up sessions.\r\nPresidency web sites have been very helpful,\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nparticularly when kept up to date. The Singapore\r\npresidency in particular worked hard at improving\r\ntransparency and the effectiveness of non-member\r\nparticipation.\r\nThe consultation process between the Council and\r\ntroop-contributing countries is settling in well. Again\r\nwe appreciate the Council’s responsiveness to concerns\r\nexpressed last year on this issue, including by my\r\ndelegation. We welcome the arrangements for\r\nconsultation between the Council’s Working Group on\r\nPeacekeeping and Troop-Contributing Countries, set\r\nout in the Council’s President’s note of 14 January.\r\nThis provides an additional mechanism to that\r\ncontained in Council resolution 1353 (2001). We found\r\nthe joint meeting with East Timor troop-contributing\r\ncountries helpful, though we would have welcomed\r\nmore interaction with Council members attending the\r\nsession.\r\nNotwithstanding these positive developments,\r\nopportunities for consultation between members and\r\nnon-members remain predominantly formal, involving\r\nset pieces with limited interaction. At times it is\r\nentirely appropriate that Member States set out national\r\npositions during these sessions. However, on other\r\noccasions the discussions could be more free-flowing.\r\nWe accept that the onus to improve the quality of these\r\ndebates rests with non-members as well as members.\r\nWe also recognize that the Council’s time is limited\r\nand that it is faced with a growing number of\r\nincreasingly complex issues. Selective use of\r\nadditional committees or working groups might help in\r\nthis regard and at the same time encourage greater\r\ninteraction between members and interested non-\r\nmembers. We wonder also whether the physical layout\r\nand grandeur of the Council Chamber might not also\r\ninhibit more useful interaction.\r\nTransparency counts most when it relates to\r\nmatters of substance. Many important issues continue\r\nto take place behind close doors. Smaller missions in\r\nparticular have difficulty keeping in touch with key\r\ndevelopments when this involves deploying limited\r\nresources outside the Council Chamber. There is only\r\nso much coffee one can drink in a day. In this regard,\r\nadvance notice of the timing of briefings is helpful.\r\nThe essential dilemma remains. When non-\r\nmembers are not permitted to attend Council meetings,\r\ntheir ability to make a contribution to its deliberations\r\ndepends on having some knowledge of those\r\ndiscussions — and then the opportunity to make an\r\ninput before the Council comes to a decision. In this\r\nregard we welcome the readiness of some non-\r\npermanent members to seek our views on regional\r\nissues coming before the Council.\r\nWe recognize that on occasion draft texts need to\r\nbe considered behind closed doors in the interest of\r\nachieving consensus. But we need to remind ourselves\r\nthat transparency and participation are the keys to\r\ncredibility and effectiveness. The rules of procedure\r\nsay that the Council shall meet in public unless it\r\ndecides otherwise; public discussion should be the rule\r\nand not the exception. In 2001, there were 183 informal\r\nconsultations compared with 159 public meetings. With\r\nrespect to private meetings, they can be a useful tool\r\nfor the involvement of non-Council members, but we\r\nneed clear and uniform rules for participation.\r\nFinally, there is little more that can be said about\r\nrecent further attempts to achieve a more representative\r\nCouncil. During the course of the year the Working\r\nGroup was unable to make any progress on the matter.\r\nThis comes at a time when the Security Council has\r\nbeen wrestling with issues that, perhaps more than\r\never, are of vital interest to the membership as a whole.\r\nIn my delegation’s view the credibility of the\r\nmultilateral system and that of the Council are\r\ninextricably linked. The Council’s standing ultimately\r\nwill depend not on how it conducts its business but on\r\nhow it is constituted. Its credibility, acceptability and\r\neffectiveness will require a change in membership to\r\nreflect the reality of the modern world. It will require\r\nan end to the right of a single country to hold the power\r\nof veto over the entire membership. My delegation\r\nconsiders also that the time is coming when we will\r\nneed to re-think anachronistic regional groupings\r\nwhich hinder rather than help the search for consensus\r\nthat is an essential feature of this unique organization.\r\nMr. Haraguchi (Japan): Looking back on the\r\nactivities of the Security Council during the past year,\r\nsince the terrorist attacks on 11 September, we think\r\nthat in general the Council has functioned well in\r\ncarrying out its tasks in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. The best example is\r\nits in counter-terrorism, where the Council enjoyed the\r\npositive cooperation of non-members. I am also\r\npleased to note that, in the case of Afghanistan, steady\r\nprogress has been made in the area of reconstruction,\r\nwith the cooperation of donor countries, and in\r\nrestoring security, also with the support of members as\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nwell as non-member countries. I highly appreciate the\r\nfact that the Council, while maintaining its unity, has\r\ntackled such complicated issues as the situation in the\r\nMiddle East and the International Criminal Court.\r\nI would like to welcome the improvements that\r\nhave been made in the working methods of the\r\nCouncil. I am particularly pleased that this year’s\r\nreport of the Security Council reflects the Council’s\r\nefforts to respond to the criticisms expressed by non-\r\nmembers of the Council during the debate on this item\r\nin the General Assembly last year. However, I would\r\nlike to make two suggestions for further improvement.\r\nFirst, I welcome the efforts of the Council to\r\nenhance participation of non-members by, for example,\r\nconvening frequent open meetings and meetings with\r\ntroop-contributing countries. However, the new\r\nmechanism for convening joint meetings between\r\nCouncil members and troop-contributing countries,\r\nwhich was introduced at the beginning of this year, still\r\nlacks clarity as to how it actually works. I would like to\r\nrequest the Council to make further improvements on\r\nthis matter. It is the view of the Government of Japan\r\nthat the effective functioning of a peacekeeping\r\noperation requires the involvement of not only those\r\ncountries which provide military and police personnel\r\nbut also those which supply civilian personnel or which\r\nmake major financial contributions. We should always\r\nbear in mind that the smooth conduct of a\r\npeacekeeping operation is possible only with the\r\nappropriate involvement of those countries.\r\nMy second suggestion relates to Security Council\r\nmissions. I understand that missions dispatched by the\r\nSecurity Council can play an important role in\r\ndetermining how the United Nations should be engaged\r\nin efforts to settle a regional conflict. However, from\r\nthe viewpoint of cost-effectiveness, I think it is\r\nnecessary that the costs, and the criteria for deciding\r\nwhen and where to dispatch a mission, as well as its\r\ncomposition, be made transparent. For instance, a clear\r\nexplanation should be given to non-members why the\r\nCouncil has deemed it necessary to send a mission to\r\nKosovo three years in succession.\r\nI welcome the Council’s voluntary efforts to\r\nimprove its working methods, although I find it\r\nregrettable that discussion among Council members has\r\nbeen conducted on the premise that the existing size\r\nand composition will be maintained. The challenges to\r\ninternational peace and security are rapidly changing,\r\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively, while the present\r\nsystem for maintaining international peace and security\r\nis led by the five States that were entrusted with that\r\nresponsibility at the time when the United Nations was\r\nestablished, more than half a century ago. It thus makes\r\nus wonder whether the present system is the most\r\nsuitable option for securing the legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness of the Council. As I have already\r\nmentioned, if we look back on its activities during the\r\npast year, we can see that the Council now requires\r\nknowledge and expertise in an ever-wider range of\r\nfields. Its counter-terrorism efforts, for example,\r\ninvolve areas of expertise ranging from public security\r\nto international financing. To ensure the\r\nimplementation of resolutions adopted by the Security\r\nCouncil, the cooperation of all Member States is,\r\nlikewise, required in a broad range of areas.\r\nHaving said this, in order to avoid any possible\r\nmisunderstanding, I have to stress that I have no\r\ndoubt — there is no question — that the present five\r\npermanent members have both the will and the\r\nadequate capacity to contribute to world peace and\r\nsecurity and that they have discharged that\r\nresponsibility well. In this new era, however, I must\r\nseriously ask: is it not important that other countries\r\nthat have strong will and adequate capacity equal to\r\nthose of the five permanent members also be actively\r\nengaged in contributing to world peace and stability,\r\nthereby further enhancing the legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness of the Council?\r\nFurthermore, with the admission of Switzerland\r\nand Timor-Leste, there are no fewer than 191 States\r\nMember of the United Nations. From the viewpoint of\r\nits representativeness, how can we keep the Council at\r\nits present size and composition, which is the same as\r\nit was nearly 40 years ago, when there were only 118\r\nMember States? It is, of course, essential that the\r\nCouncil’s efficiency be maintained. However, I think it\r\nis increasingly necessary to expand the Council, while\r\npaying due attention to ensuring that its effectiveness\r\nwill not be sacrificed.\r\nI believe that the views I have just expressed are\r\nshared by most of the United Nations membership. The\r\nfact that 80 countries referred to the need to reform the\r\nSecurity Council during the general debate last month\r\nsupports this belief. Also, within the broader\r\nframework of strengthening the United Nations, we\r\nmust bear in mind that Security Council reform\r\nremains one of the most important items on the United\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nNations agenda. As Secretary-General Kofi Annan put\r\nit in his report on that issue, “no reform of the United\r\nNations would be complete without reform of the\r\nSecurity Council” (A/57/387, para. 20).\r\nIn his statement at the close of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession, the then President of the Assembly, Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo, mentioned that in the past year the\r\ndiscussion of Security Council reform had not seen\r\nmuch change (see A/56/PV.112, p.3). Japan shares the\r\nfrustration that many countries are now feeling.\r\nBecause the United Nations has had to devote itself to\r\nthe fight against terrorism over the past year, we have\r\nbeen unable to build upon the momentum that had been\r\ngenerated at the Millennium Summit the previous year.\r\nIt is thus all the more important that we revitalize our\r\ndiscussion now. In noting that the debate on reform\r\nwill enter its tenth year next year, Prime Minister\r\nKoizumi avowed in his statement in this Hall in\r\nSeptember (see A/57/PV.4) that Japan intends to work\r\nhard to achieve progress on Security Council reform.\r\nMy delegation believes that, as the first practical\r\nstep towards concluding a comprehensive reform\r\npackage, our discussions at the meetings of the Open-\r\nended Working Group on Security Council reform\r\nshould now focus on such questions as the number of\r\nseats on an enlarged Council. Based on my delegation’s\r\nexperience last year, we cannot expect to make\r\nprogress by repeating our discussion of existing papers.\r\nWe thus look forward to the positive engagement by\r\nthe Bureau of the Working Group, under the leadership\r\nof the President of the Assembly, Mr. Jan Kavan.\r\nAs we continue with this task, we also think that\r\nit will be helpful to provide opportunities to consider\r\nthe issue from various angles, both inside and outside\r\nthe United Nations, and with wider participation by\r\nboth Government officials and non-governmental\r\nactors. In the event that concrete progress towards\r\nSecurity Council reform is not achieved, even after 10\r\nyears of deliberations on this issue, it might be\r\nworthwhile to consider measures for moving the\r\ndiscussion forward by, for example, holding meetings\r\nwith representatives of Member States at the political\r\nlevel.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, heads of State or\r\nGovernment committed themselves to comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council. It is up to us to\r\ncontinue our efforts towards that end. Japan reaffirms\r\nits determination to do just that and is ready to\r\ncooperate with other Member States to realize our\r\ncommon objective, Security Council reform.\r\nMr. Nambiar (India): At the outset, on behalf of\r\nmy delegation, I must express India’s absolute and\r\nunequivocal condemnation of the senseless and heinous\r\nterrorist act recently perpetrated in Bali, Indonesia,\r\nwhich resulted in the tragic death of so many innocent\r\ncivilians. We convey our profound condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Indonesia, as well as to\r\nthe families of the victims of this tragic incident. We\r\nreaffirm our determination to work to the full with the\r\ninternational community in united efforts to confront\r\nthe terrible menace of international terrorism.\r\nPlease allow me to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to Ambassador Belinga-Eboutou,\r\nPresident of the Security Council, for his introduction\r\nof the report of the Council (A/57/2 and Corr.1). I\r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate\r\nAngola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain on their\r\nelection to the Security Council.\r\nAn analysis of the organic instrument that\r\nconstitutes the bedrock of the United Nations, namely\r\nthe Charter, shows that the exercise of the primary\r\nresponsibility of the Security Council is linked to the\r\nconsideration of its reports by the General Assembly.\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3 and Article 15 of the Charter\r\nrequire the Security Council to submit and the General\r\nAssembly to receive and consider annual and special\r\nreports. The Security Council’s submission of its\r\nannual report to the General Assembly for\r\nconsideration establishes a modicum of accountability\r\nin the relationship between the Security Council and\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nIt is, therefore, gratifying to note that the report\r\nof the Security Council this year represents a fresh\r\napproach to the very issues raised in this Assembly on\r\nthe accountability and transparency of the Council in\r\nits functioning as an organ of the United Nations. The\r\nnew format of the report and, more important, the\r\nattempt at reform leading to greater transparency and\r\nconsultation with non-members on major issues, are\r\nimportant steps in the right direction.\r\nIn that context, I wish to place on record our\r\nappreciation for the proactive role played by\r\nSingapore, under the very able guidance of\r\nAmbassador Mahbubani, in ensuring that many of the\r\nideas raised in the General Assembly for improvement\r\nin the functioning of the Security Council are being\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nimplemented. Admittedly, no effort of one single\r\nmember can be successful without the cooperation of\r\nthe other members. All the current members of the\r\nSecurity Council have undoubtedly contributed\r\ntowards initiating the changes in the Council, and we\r\nwish to congratulate each of them on their effort. I\r\nwish to also thank the Secretariat for bringing out a\r\nmuch shorter, more concise and better focused report\r\non the work of the Security Council.\r\nDocument S/PV.4616, which contains the\r\nprovisional verbatim record of the Security Council’s\r\nmeeting held to consider the draft report of the Council\r\nto the General Assembly, provides a valuable insight\r\ninto the effort and cooperation that went into the\r\nreforms sought to be introduced in the working of the\r\nCouncil. Ambassador Mahbubani, on the basis of his\r\nunique insight from within, has described the Security\r\nCouncil as one of the most conservative institutions in\r\nthe world today. Reforms are not easily introduced into\r\na body that has remained unchanged in core\r\ncomposition since its inception more than 50 years ago.\r\nYet it is important that the Council also heed the calls\r\nfor reform in an Organization that has initiated reform\r\nmeasures in all its other major organs.\r\nWe fully agree with Ambassador Mahbubani\r\nwhen he advocates the need for formalizing the system\r\nof drawing names to determine the speakers’ list for\r\npublic meetings. There is surely a method in the\r\nmadness here, but we have yet to discern it.\r\nStandardization of the nomenclature of the different\r\ntypes of meetings of the Council would be another\r\nuseful action. A perusal of document S/2002/603, a\r\nnote by the President of the Security Council on\r\nprocedural developments in the Council in 2001,\r\nindicates the multifarious forms of meetings, orders of\r\nspeakers and innovations within them that the Council\r\nadopted during that period of time.\r\nWe fully appreciate the point brought out by\r\nAmbassador Levitte of France in his intervention at the\r\nSecurity Council meeting on the report that the Council\r\nhas moved from a period of hibernation to a period of\r\nrapid development (see S/PV.4616, p. 7). In 2001, the\r\nCouncil held 192 formal meetings, the highest in a one-\r\nyear period since its inception. Of greater importance is\r\nthe fact that 159 of those meetings were public, the\r\nfourth highest number of public meetings in a year in\r\nthe Council’s history. That is a good beginning towards\r\ntransparency.\r\nWe favour more open meetings, allowing the\r\nparticipation of non-members in the debates, thereby\r\nenabling the views of the wider comity of nations to be\r\nheard and taken into account in the Council’s\r\nconsideration of vital issues of global import. Better\r\norganization in the form of advance intimation of the\r\nmonthly programme of work, information posted on\r\nthe Council’s United Nations web site and on the web\r\nsites of the Missions of Member States holding the\r\npresidency of the Council for a particular month, and\r\nwrap-up sessions are all positive developments in the\r\nmove towards transparency in the Council’s\r\nfunctioning.\r\nAmbassador Greenstock of the United Kingdom\r\nhas spoken of the need to assess the quality, and not\r\njust the quantity, of the Council’s work. We are in\r\nagreement with that observation. The Council moved\r\nquickly and decisively in the aftermath of the 11\r\nSeptember 2001 attacks to adopt resolutions 1363\r\n(2001) and 1368 (2001) and the landmark resolution\r\n1373 (2001), as well as the sanctions against the\r\nTaliban under the earlier resolutions 1267 (1999) and\r\n1333 (2000). In January 2002, the Council adopted its\r\nresolution 1390 (2002) to respond to the threat posed\r\nby the Taliban and Al Qaeda. It established the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, which has begun its\r\nwork with the spirit and dynamism that the situation\r\ndemands. The Council’s active intervention in\r\nestablishing the International Security Assistance Force\r\nin Afghanistan and coordinating the role of\r\npeacekeepers in various conflict situations in Africa\r\nand elsewhere have proved valuable in dousing the\r\nfires raging in many of those areas.\r\nSome of the Council’s actions continue to require\r\ngreater clarity, equity and sense of purpose. For\r\ninstance, the role of the Council in running the oil-for-\r\nfood programme for Iraq, under which Council\r\nmembers decide which contracts to approve and which\r\nto put on hold, has led to a situation where 866\r\ncontracts worth $2.7 billion have been put on hold as\r\nof 4 October 2002, without any effective or\r\nindependent avenue to improve the situation. The\r\nreasons why the shortfalls in Iraqi oil exports have\r\nrisen, leading to approximately $2.56 billion of\r\nhumanitarian goods being placed on hold, have to be\r\nexamined and gone into with a sense of urgency and\r\ncompassion for the people of Iraq.\r\nWhile the efforts at reform, initiated primarily by\r\nnon-Council members to introduce greater\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\ntransparency and accountability in the Council’s\r\nfunctioning, have been an important step in the right\r\ndirection, the process of reform should in no way be\r\nconsidered as having been completed or fully\r\naccomplished. We would urge the Security Council to\r\nmake transparency an essential feature of its\r\nfunctioning. A major effort should go towards making\r\nclosed meetings an exception. We agree\r\nwholeheartedly with Ambassador Greenstock that\r\nvirtually all Council meetings, with the exception of\r\nthose involving negotiation of texts and those on issues\r\nthat require confidentiality, could be kept open.\r\nIt is quite natural that, given the profusion of\r\nconflicts arising in the aftermath of the cold war, the\r\nCouncil would have overextended itself in its efforts to\r\ncontribute to the resolution of those situations. While it\r\nis the Council’s primary responsibility to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, it is necessary to\r\nrealize the practical and realistic limitations of\r\ninvolvement in all situations, particularly those that are\r\nbest contained through the efforts of the parties\r\ninvolved. Here again, we agree with Ambassador\r\nGreenstock when he says that there are some issues\r\nthat the Council cannot resolve, and that, in his belief,\r\navoiding the Council is, empirically, the right way to\r\ngo.\r\nWe also appreciate the spirit behind which efforts\r\nhave been made under what has now come to be known\r\nas the Arria formula to introduce greater informal\r\ninteractions between the Council and the\r\nrepresentatives of organizations that could provide\r\nvaluable inputs into the Council’s workings. A notable\r\nexample of the utility of Arria-formula meetings,\r\nreferred to by the President of the Security Council in\r\nhis note on transparency in the Council, is the meeting\r\nheld on 6 March 2001 with the Secretary-General of\r\nNATO. Arria-formula meetings have also been utilized\r\nby presidencies to facilitate meetings of Council\r\nmembers with representatives of non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society, including academics.\r\nThat, on the face of it, is a desirable trend when it\r\ninvolves mainly social and economic issues that could\r\nhave an impact on the Council’s overall assessment of\r\na situation. However, when it comes to dealing with\r\ncomplicated and long-standing political issues with the\r\nconcomitant sensitivity and controversial implications,\r\nthe Council would be well advised to exercise greater\r\ncircumspection.\r\nIt is our considered view — and a view which I\r\nam certain many other members share — that in an\r\neffort to increase transparency, the Arria formula\r\nshould not, in fact, introduce subjectivity and\r\ncontroversy that could ultimately prove more injurious\r\nthan therapeutic to the issue it ostensibly seeks to\r\nresolve. Nor should it prove divisive within the\r\nCouncil membership. We would recommend that strong\r\nrules governing the issues on which such meetings may\r\nbe called, the choice of parties involved in the briefing\r\nand the expression of the views of Member States, if\r\nany, be framed before any such initiative is undertaken\r\nin the future. This would be a genuine effort towards\r\ntransparency. Otherwise, the question of why Arria-\r\nformula meetings are not held on issues in which\r\nCouncil members are themselves involved would\r\nindeed become a vexed one.\r\nBeyond the flaws in the reporting procedures and\r\nin the meetings behind closed doors, there is a deeper\r\nsubterranean fault line, a malady which points to the\r\nloss of moral vision and of the democratic ethos of\r\nrepresentation in the Security Council. Many a problem\r\nconfronts us today because of the way the Security\r\nCouncil is structured. The structure and composition of\r\nthe Council are demonstrably out of touch with the\r\nrealities on the ground and are no longer capable of\r\nmeeting the aspirations and expectations of the\r\nmembership and of the international community at\r\nlarge.\r\nThe solution lies in reforming and restructuring\r\nthe Council comprehensively. Much has been said and\r\nwritten on this subject, and consensus continues to\r\nelude us in the deliberations of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. But on one point there is general\r\nagreement: the Security Council, as it is composed\r\ntoday, is unrepresentative and anachronistic, and in no\r\nway reflects a world that has changed dramatically in\r\nthe more than 50 years since San Francisco. That the\r\ndeveloping countries, which constitute the vast\r\nmajority of the general membership of the United\r\nNations, find no place in the category of permanent\r\nmembers and are generally inadequately represented in\r\nthe non-permanent category, serves only to further\r\nhighlight the unrepresentative and unbalanced nature of\r\na body that, by definition, is responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, but\r\nwhich, in practical fact, is ill-equipped to do so to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Members of the Organization. The\r\nCouncil’s actions cannot be seen to command a\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nlegitimacy which its own composition and working\r\nmethods do not possess.\r\nThere is little disagreement among Member\r\nStates that the Council requires reform to better reflect\r\ncurrent global realities; reform that imparts balance,\r\nrepresentativeness and legitimacy to the Council and\r\nreflects contemporary reality; reform that is not\r\npiecemeal or partial — which would only serve to\r\nperpetuate the unrepresentative character of the\r\nCouncil and erode its credibility even further; reform\r\nthat is comprehensive, includes expansion of the\r\nCouncil’s membership in both the permanent and the\r\nnon-permanent categories and improves its working\r\nmethods; and reform of its decision-making processes.\r\nAny reform that does not contain these core elements\r\nwould, in our opinion, be no reform.\r\nWe have had occasion to outline India’s position\r\non Security Council restructuring on several occasions\r\nin the past, and we shall refrain from doing so in detail\r\nnow. However, we would like to caution against the\r\ntemptation to resort to piecemeal and partial solutions.\r\nAfter toiling for nine years, if we were to agree to an\r\nexpansion of the Council in the non-permanent\r\ncategory alone, or if we were to make cosmetic\r\nchanges in its working methods, we would be doing a\r\nmajor disservice, not only to ourselves but to the\r\nOrganization as a whole. Expansion is needed in both\r\ncategories of Council membership, and if an attempt to\r\ndo otherwise is made, we would be not only shying\r\naway from the main issues that confront us but also\r\nperpetuating an international system characterized by\r\ninequity.\r\nTurning to the Working Group, we note that there\r\nhave been many fewer sessions and meetings this year\r\ncompared to the past, reflecting the present state of\r\nennui among member States. There has been progress,\r\nthough, in the Council’s working practices. Particularly\r\nnoteworthy in this connection is the stepped-up\r\ninteraction between the Council and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries, which we would like to see as\r\nan ongoing, expanding and fruitful interaction in the\r\nyears to come. India remains committed to evolution in\r\nthis respect.\r\nWe have deliberately confined ourselves to\r\noutlining very briefly the fundamental precepts on\r\nwhich we believe the reform and expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council should be structured. My delegation\r\nwill participate in and contribute to the consideration\r\nof specific issues when the Working Group begins a\r\ndetailed discussion of them next year. Suffice it to say\r\nthat India remains committed to implementing the call\r\nof world leaders in the Millennium Declaration to\r\nachieve comprehensive reform of the Council in all its\r\naspects and that we see the Working Group as the\r\nlegitimate instrument with which to do so. We welcome\r\nall constructive proposals to carry our work forward,\r\nand would be happy to cooperate with the Bureau and\r\nall other members of the Open-ended Working Group\r\ntowards that end.\r\nWe also wish to place on record our reservations\r\nconcerning the need for the Security Council to spend\r\nso much time on thematic issues such as women and\r\narmed conflict, children and armed conflict and the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict, all of which\r\npertain to the management of conflict and are therefore\r\noutside the Council’s mandate. This transgression into\r\nareas allocated to other United Nations bodies\r\ncompetent to handle many of these thematic issues\r\ncould be condoned if the discussions added value.\r\nUnfortunately, they add nothing to either the norms set\r\nby international law or to its practice.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to state that the process of\r\nintroducing reform and change into the Council’s\r\nfunctioning is both noteworthy and laudable. While\r\nwelcoming them, we also look forward to the\r\ncontinuation of this process. The Security Council\r\nshould not be seen as an isolated island of exclusion in\r\na democratic polity. The attempts at reform and greater\r\nparticipation have to be seen in this light.\r\nMr. Ngo Duc Thang (Viet Nam): At the outset, I\r\nwish to join other speakers in expressing our heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the Government of Indonesia and to the\r\nrelatives of all of the victims of the brutal terrorist\r\nattack that took place in Bali on Saturday. We condemn\r\nthe attack in the strongest terms.\r\nThe delegation of Viet Nam attaches great\r\nimportance to the agenda items under consideration:\r\nthe Security Council’s work and its reform. I wish to\r\ncompliment Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani and his\r\nstaff for their part in compiling the concise and\r\ninsightful report (A/57/2 and Corr.1) that covers the\r\nwork of the Security Council for the period from 16\r\nJune 2001 to 31 July 2002. Given the number of issues\r\nin the report, my delegation would like to make some\r\nobservations on several topics which we consider to be\r\nof vital importance.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nWe hold the view that the work of the Security\r\nCouncil has brought about certain positive results in\r\nmaintaining peace and security in Timor-Leste,\r\nAfghanistan, parts of Africa and the Balkans, and\r\nespecially in assuming major new responsibilities in\r\ncombating global terrorism after the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001. Immediately after that terrorist attack,\r\nthe Security Council adopted its resolution 1373 (2001)\r\nand set up the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)\r\ncharged with monitoring the implementation of that\r\nresolution. The CTC embarked on its work seriously,\r\nquickly providing guidance to Member States on how\r\nthey should report on steps taken to implement the\r\nresolution.\r\nWe appreciate the attention paid by the United\r\nNations system in general and the Security Council in\r\nparticular to various aspects of the Afghan crisis. The\r\nCouncil has greatly contributed to restoring peace in\r\nthe country and to helping the Afghans to form a\r\nbroad-based and representative Government and to\r\nstart their national reconstruction after more than two\r\ndecades of war, terror, suffering and misery.\r\nThe declaration of independence of Timor-Leste\r\non 20 May 2002 is another real success story for the\r\nUnited Nations, in which the work of the Security\r\nCouncil must be commended as well.\r\nHowever, while applauding the encouraging\r\nresults of the Council’s work, we cannot fail but\r\nmention the protracted Middle East crisis. Despite the\r\nattention paid by the Council to the ongoing crisis\r\nduring the past year, it is regrettable that the continued\r\naggressive policy of the Israeli Government on one\r\nhand and the lack of consistent measures by the\r\nSecurity Council on the other did not allow for the\r\nimplementation of several Security Council resolutions\r\non the issue. As a result, the situation in the region\r\nremains volatile, and the prospect of lasting peace is\r\never more remote. In this connection, my delegation\r\nbelieves that it is necessary for every State Member of\r\nthe United Nations to abide by the Council’s\r\nresolutions, thereby leaving no impression of double\r\nstandard in the Council’s work.\r\nWith respect to the Council’s work, we are\r\npleased to note that the Council has made a number of\r\nuseful changes in its methods of work, such as an\r\nincrease in the number of open meetings; briefings\r\nprovided at the end of the monthly Council presidency;\r\nconsultations with troop-contributing countries; and\r\ndebates open to non-members of the Council. Together\r\nwith the Council’s interactive meetings with\r\nrepresentatives of the Secretary-General, his special\r\nenvoys and the Secretary-General himself, as well as\r\nthematic debates and wrap-up discussions on the work\r\nof the Security Council, all these practices can help\r\nenhance transparency and accountability in the\r\nCouncil’s work and make that organ more effective and\r\ndemocratic.\r\nWe welcome further measures enabling non-\r\nmembers of the Council to participate more actively in\r\nthe discussion of the most important issues, for it is our\r\nconviction that this will help the Council better to\r\nequip itself to deal with crises when they occur in\r\nfuture.\r\nMy delegation joins with other speakers to call on\r\nthe Council to make a critical evaluation of the\r\neffectiveness of sanctions imposed on Member States,\r\nwhich have caused untold suffering to innocent people,\r\nparticularly women and children. We believe that\r\nsanctions are outdated and should never be used\r\nindefinitely. In this regard, we welcome the Council’s\r\ndecision to lift the embargo imposed on the Sudan and\r\ncall it to do the same in the case of Iraq.\r\nMy country has always paid special interest to the\r\nreform of the Security Council, as it forms the\r\ncornerstone of the overall process of United Nations\r\nreform. Therefore, we wish to reiterate our position\r\nthat there is a need to accelerate this urgent task, as the\r\nlack of tangible progress in fundamental areas of\r\nreform, despite nine years of discussion, has no doubt\r\nbeen frustrating. It is true that the issues are of a\r\ncomplex and sensitive nature, which makes the task of\r\nreaching agreement a formidable challenge. But the\r\nUnited Nations cannot afford to fail in this important\r\ntask, or the credibility of the Organization as a whole\r\nwill be put at risk. My delegation reiterates its support\r\nfor the view that more vigorous efforts should be made\r\nby all countries to move forward the process of\r\nreforming the Security Council, as expressed in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nViet Nam believes that reform of the Security\r\nCouncil must be comprehensive and that it should be\r\npursued in the context of strengthening the authority of\r\nthe General Assembly, be based on transparency and on\r\ndemocratic principles, and be undertaken in full\r\nconformity with its intrinsic purpose. The reform must\r\nreflect the three basic components of the process: an\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\nincrease in the Council’s membership; decision-making\r\nprocess; and working methods. We believe that it is\r\nurgent and necessary to correct the current imbalance\r\nby ensuring more balanced and equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and by increasing the participation of\r\ndeveloping countries, emerging regional players and\r\ncentres of economic power.\r\nIt is important to ensure that the interest of all\r\nnations are sufficiently reflected in the composition of\r\nthe Security Council, in line with the complexity of a\r\nworld that has seen great development, both\r\nquantitative and qualitative, in international relations.\r\nWe support the idea of enlarging both categories\r\nof members — permanent and non-permanent — and\r\nbelieve that due recognition should be given to\r\nimproving the Council’s working procedures and\r\ndecision-making process, so that it can become more\r\ndemocratic, representative, and transparent and be\r\nbetter prepared to face the security challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nLet me conclude my statement by congratulating\r\nGermany, Spain, Pakistan, Angola and Chile on their\r\nelection to the Security Council. I hope that the new\r\nnon-permanent members will help enhance the\r\nopenness, transparency and representativeness of the\r\nCouncil to the full extent permissible under the current\r\nstructure of this main body of the United Nations. I\r\nalso wish to express our gratitude to the outgoing\r\nmembers for their contribution to the promotion of\r\npeace and international security.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): Let me begin by\r\nexpressing my deep condolences to the Government\r\nand the people of Indonesia, as well as to Australia and\r\nto the other countries who lost their nationals in the\r\nrecent terrorist tragedy in Bali. We hope that the\r\nperpetrators of this atrocity will be brought to justice\r\nsoon.\r\nWe wish also to express our appreciation to\r\nAmbassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou, the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Cameroon and the current President\r\nof the Security Council, for introducing the annual\r\nreport of the Council to the General Assembly. May I\r\ntake this opportunity to thank those delegations which\r\nhave congratulated Pakistan on its election to the\r\nCouncil for the next two years.\r\nI would in turn wish to felicitate Angola, Chile,\r\nSpain and Germany on their election to the Council last\r\nmonth. We look forward to working closely with them\r\nas well as with other Council members in our common\r\npursuit of global peace and security. I would wish to\r\npay special tribute to the outgoing members of the\r\nCouncil for the important contributions to its work.\r\nThis year, the Security Council’s annual report,\r\nsubmitted in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter,\r\nhas been presented in a new, improved format with an\r\nanalytical summary. We appreciate the conscious effort\r\nmade to reduce the size of the report and to avoid\r\nrepetition, as well as the active role played by the\r\nCouncil’s non-permanent members in making these\r\nimprovements.\r\nFirst, I would note the Council’s visible\r\nsuccesses. The Council’s supervision and support for a\r\nnumber of peacekeeping operations — especially those\r\nin Timor-Leste and Sierra Leone — have been the most\r\nvisible manifestations of collective security, as\r\nvisualized in the United Nations Charter. Both the\r\nSecurity Council and the United Nations have learnt\r\nappropriate lessons from the past. We hope that in\r\nfuture, too, the Council, the Secretariat and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries will work together to ensure the\r\neffective realization of the larger purposes of the re-\r\nestablishment and preservation of peace and security in\r\nso many troubled parts of the world.\r\nDuring the past year, the Security Council made a\r\nsignificant contribution to combating international\r\nterrorism, including the adoption of provisions to arrest\r\nthe financing and support of terrorism through the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee. The Security Council\r\nalso played a role in shaping the events in Afghanistan.\r\nYet, all these endeavours to build peace and restore\r\nhope in Afghanistan remain under threat so long as the\r\ninternational community, including the Security\r\nCouncil, is unable to consolidate peace and security\r\nand establish President Karzai’s authority in all parts\r\nand regions of Afghanistan. To this end, Pakistan has\r\ncontinued to urge the Security Council and the\r\nSecretary-General, as well as the major Powers, to\r\nauthorize the deployment of additional international\r\nforces, especially in regional centres. It is imperative\r\nfor the Council to take early and resolute action for this\r\npurpose.\r\nThe Middle East crisis and the prolonged tragedy\r\nof the Palestinian people have continued to challenge\r\nthe credibility of the Security Council. The Council\r\nachieved a high point when it adopted resolution 1397\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\n(2002), creating the framework for a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict on\r\nthe basis of the principle of land for peace. Since then,\r\nhowever, confronted by repeated Israeli military\r\nincursions, punitive measures, the economic\r\nstrangulation of the Palestinian people and spiralling\r\nviolence in the occupied territories, the Security\r\nCouncil’s deliberations have become almost a parody\r\nof the role which the Charter had perceived for it.\r\nAmong the most glaring of the Council’s failures\r\nhas been its inability even to reverse the threat to peace\r\nin South Asia, even though the India-Pakistan issue and\r\nthe underlying dispute over Jammu and Kashmir\r\nremain on the Council’s agenda. With one million\r\ntroops deployed by India along Pakistan’s eastern\r\nborder and the Line of Control in Kashmir; with\r\nrepeated threats from New Delhi of war and the use of\r\nforce against Pakistan; and with artillery and small\r\narms exchanges a daily feature on the Line of Control,\r\nthere could be no clearer and more tangible threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, even if one were to\r\ndiscount the danger arising from the fact that the two\r\nantagonists possess nuclear weapons.\r\nThe United Nations Charter requires that, in the\r\nevent of a breach of the peace or a threat of use of\r\nforce, the Security Council shall address the situation\r\nwith a view to restoring such peace and security. The\r\nCouncil’s responsibility to prevent a conflict in South\r\nAsia, which has been described as “the most has\r\ndangerous place in the world”, is clear and present.\r\nYet, although the Council’s attention was drawn to the\r\ncrisis repeatedly during the year, including by the\r\nSecretary-General himself, the Council remained\r\nimpassive. Not even an Arria-formula meeting could be\r\nconvened for this purpose. War may have been\r\ntemporarily averted by the active diplomacy of some\r\nmajor Powers, but neither the Council nor the\r\ninternational community can afford to substitute\r\nconflict management for conflict resolution.\r\nDuring the Security Council’s debate on this\r\nreport, Ambassador Mahbubani of Singapore referred\r\nto the Council’s “orphans” — peoples on whose behalf\r\nthe Council had undertaken to act but never did. Most\r\nprominent among these orphans are the people of\r\nJammu and Kashmir. The Council has adopted a series\r\nof resolutions defining a clear framework for the\r\npolitical disposition of Kashmir in accordance with the\r\nfreely expressed wishes of the Kashmiri people, under\r\na United Nations-supervised plebiscite. These\r\nresolutions remain to be implemented.\r\nThe Council should not be oblivious to the\r\nerosion of its credibility flowing from non-compliance\r\nwith its resolutions. The Council has been convincingly\r\nreminded of this in recent weeks. Ineffectiveness and\r\nweakness flow not only from an absence of\r\ndetermination and will to secure compliance with\r\ncertain resolutions of the Security Council; they are\r\nalso manifested by the acceptance and application of\r\ndouble standards and discrimination. The Council’s\r\nresolutions represent international legality; they must\r\nbe respected comprehensively by all sides, in all\r\nregions and in all circumstances.\r\nThe Council’s failures have not been due mainly\r\nto the shortcomings in its procedures or, indeed, in its\r\nstructures. These failures are principally due to a\r\nshortfall in the commitment of Member States,\r\nindividually and collectively, to conduct their policies\r\nand uphold their legitimate national interests strictly in\r\naccordance with the United Nations Charter and its\r\nprinciples.\r\nWe are convinced that the departures from\r\nprinciple witnessed in the Council would become more\r\nisolated and infrequent if the Council were to become a\r\nmore representative body. Pakistan therefore continues\r\nto support the expansion of the Security Council’s\r\nmembership. At the same time, we will continue to\r\nresist proliferation of the centres of privilege\r\nrepresented by the unfortunate institution of the five\r\npermanent members of the Security Council and their\r\nveto power. It is clear that, for the present, consensus\r\nwithin the General Assembly would favour the\r\nexpansion of only the non-permanent, elected members\r\nof the Council.\r\nThere have been prolonged endeavours to\r\nimprove the Council’s working methods, transparency\r\nand effectiveness. We appreciate these. We support the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation that the improved\r\npractices should now be codified.\r\nWe also welcome the recent efforts to make the\r\nCouncil’s work more transparent and inclusive for the\r\nrest of the United Nations membership. Rule 48 of the\r\nCouncil’s provisional rules of procedure specifically\r\nstates: “Unless it decides otherwise, the Security\r\nCouncil shall meet in public.” Despite the increase in\r\nthe number of public debates and the consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries, the Council’s\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.28\r\ndecisions continue to be made mostly behind closed\r\ndoors. In a statement to the Council in 1994, the\r\nrepresentative of one of the five permanent members\r\ndescribed such informal consultations in the following\r\nwords:\r\n“Informal meetings are not even real Council\r\nmeetings at all; they have no official existence,\r\nand are assigned no number. Yet it is in these\r\nmeetings that all the Council’s work is carried\r\nout.” (S/PV.3483, p. 2)\r\nThe argument that there is a trade-off between\r\nefficiency and transparency is a false one, we believe.\r\nIndeed, it can be argued more cogently that the\r\nWilsonian principle of “open covenants, openly arrived\r\nat” is the one that will enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nCouncil and the consistent application of the United\r\nNations Charter’s principles. In the circumstances, we\r\nbelieve that the General Assembly, the most universal\r\nand representative organ of the United Nations, should\r\nrecommend the following measures to the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nFirst, the improvements made in the Council’s\r\nworking methods should be codified, as recommended\r\nby the Secretary-General. Secondly, rule 48 of Security\r\nCouncil’s provisional rules of procedure should be\r\nadhered to in letter and in spirit. Thirdly, a\r\ncompendium should be drawn up of those Security\r\nCouncil resolutions whose implementation remains\r\noutstanding. Fourthly, the Security Council, in\r\ncooperation with the Secretary-General, should\r\nundertake a thorough consideration of how the\r\nprovisions of Chapter VI of the Charter can be fully\r\nutilized to promote the pacific settlement of conflicts\r\nand disputes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
