(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Miss Clarke\r\n(Barbados), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 40 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/57/2 and\r\nA/57/2/Corr.1)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): It seems that I am not lucky. As the first\r\nspeaker on the list this morning, I will be talking to\r\nmyself and to the handful of colleagues in the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMy delegation would like to extend its thanks to\r\nAmbassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou, President of the\r\nSecurity Council for this month, for his presentation of\r\nthe report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly. We also wish to extend our warm thanks to\r\nthe staff of the Secretariat for the considerable efforts\r\nthat they have made in preparing this report.\r\nToday, we are discussing the report of the\r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly under\r\nparagraph 1 of Article 15 and paragraph 3 of Article 24\r\nof the United Nations Charter. I would like to mention\r\nthe great importance attached to the General\r\nAssembly’s discussion of the report in order to hear the\r\nviews of Member States on the performance of the\r\nSecurity Council and its follow-up of its\r\nresponsibilities in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn that context, we would like to state that one of\r\nthe significant changes to the report was a brief\r\nanalytical introduction. Resolution 51/193, adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly in its fifty-first session, aimed,\r\ninter alia, at making the report of the Council more\r\nanalytical. Thus, this report complies with that\r\nresolution, as it contains an analytical introduction.\r\nMore than 10 months have passed since Syria\r\njoined the Security Council, following its election in\r\nthe General Assembly by an overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States. We should like to express once again\r\nour most sincere thanks to the States that supported us.\r\nSyria brought to the Council many issues and areas of\r\nconcern that attracted the interest of many\r\nrepresentatives of Member States, including the issue\r\nof improving the mechanisms by which the Council\r\ndeals with the various matters of discussion before it.\r\nToday, we see changes in substance and form in\r\nthe report of the Security Council, thanks to the\r\ncooperation of all members of the Council. As far as\r\nsubstance is concerned, the report now contains an\r\nintroduction that includes a brief analysis of political\r\nactions undertaken by the Council — a change that\r\nMember States had requested for many years. With\r\nregard to form, the report’s volume and its number of\r\npages have been reduced. As a result, it is both more\r\nuseful and more economical.\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nHere, we should like to express our special thanks\r\nto Ambassador Mahbubani and to the Mission of\r\nSingapore for their strenuous follow-up efforts during\r\nthe past period, which produced the desired result.\r\nHowever, we believe that much work remains to be\r\ndone by the Council to make the report an actual\r\nreflection of the actions that the Council has taken,\r\nregardless of the extent of their success.\r\nDuring the period under consideration, the\r\nSecurity Council achieved remarkable progress in\r\nmaking its work more transparent. There was\r\nparticipation by non-Council members, which were\r\nable to express their views on the political issues being\r\ndiscussed and on finding solutions to them. The\r\nCouncil held final meetings in which members and\r\nnon-members frankly evaluated its work. Under the\r\npresidency of Syria in June, the Council held a great\r\nnumber of meetings in which it discussed issues related\r\nto various regions — whether to the Middle East,\r\nAfrica, Asia or Europe — or specific issues such as\r\ncombating international terrorism or promoting the role\r\nof the Security Council or of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, at various levels. In addition, a final\r\nmeeting was held to evaluate the Council’s work in\r\nterms of the principle of transparency.\r\nOne of the first issues presented by Syria — to\r\nwhich the Council responded last January — was the\r\nconducting of a monthly briefing on the Middle East.\r\nOne of these briefings was presided over by Mr. Farouk\r\nAl-Shara’, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, and in\r\nothers, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, and\r\nother high-level United Nations officials discussed\r\ndevelopments in the Middle East. It has become clear\r\nthat such briefings represent an advanced step in the\r\nway in which the Council deals with one of the most\r\ntense regions in the world. They also place on the\r\nshoulders of Member States the requisite responsibility\r\nto put an end to Israeli practices and Israeli occupation,\r\nwith a view to finding a comprehensive and just\r\nsolution to the Middle East problem, based on the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and on the\r\nMadrid terms of reference, as well as on the Arab\r\ninitiative adopted at the Beirut Summit, held in March.\r\nDuring the period under consideration, the\r\nCouncil undertook intensive efforts to address the\r\nsensitive problems in Africa with a view to settling the\r\ndisputes and wars on the continent. In that connection,\r\nwe should like to refer to a number of open Council\r\nmeetings that included the participation of concerned\r\nStates — in particular African States — and of\r\nMember States in general to restore peace and security\r\nto the African continent, which urgently needs the\r\nconcerted efforts of the international community and its\r\nunlimited support to achieve development and to\r\neradicate the root causes of conflict. Syria has left no\r\nstone unturned in participating in Council deliberations\r\nand in adopting resolutions that reflect the views of\r\nconcerned States, with a view to finding consensus on\r\npositions that would end conflicts and serve lasting\r\npeace.\r\nWe should like to state that the Council’s dispatch\r\nof missions to areas of tension and conflict was very\r\nimportant, because it enabled us to gain firsthand\r\nknowledge of the situation on the ground. For example,\r\none mission was sent to Eritrea and Ethiopia, another\r\nvisited the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and a\r\nworkshop was held on the Mano River Union. A\r\nmission will soon visit Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nKosovo and Belgrade.\r\nAlso during the past period, the Security Council\r\ndiscussed many substantive matters, including in the\r\nareas of peacekeeping operations, the protection of\r\nwomen and children in armed conflict and terrorism.\r\nThe Council was successful in addressing many of\r\nthose issues. It made tangible progress, and we are\r\ntrying our best to improve the Council’s work in that\r\ndirection. Yet we should like to state that, in the period\r\nunder consideration and the preceding period, the\r\nCouncil could not follow up on the implementation of\r\nthe resolutions it had adopted. That encouraged certain\r\nparties — especially in the conflict areas in Africa and\r\nin the Middle East — not to respond to Council\r\nresolutions. They have ignored those resolutions. As\r\nconflicts become more protracted, the matter becomes\r\nmore sensitive, especially when they relate to\r\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council, under the\r\nprovisions of the Charter, for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. In such situations, the\r\nCouncil has been unable to maintain international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWe believe that lack of follow-up on the\r\nimplementation of the Security Council’s resolutions\r\nwill have a negative effect on the Council’s role and on\r\nthe international community’s view of the Council. All\r\nof us know, for instance, that Israel has rejected,\r\nignored and refused to implement the Council’s\r\nresolutions — resolutions that should have been\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nimplemented with the Council’s insistence. If the\r\nresolutions had been implemented during the past few\r\ndecades, peace and security would have prevailed in\r\nthe Middle East.\r\nThe Council has adopted 29 resolutions regarding\r\nIsrael, none of which have been implemented. Some\r\nmembers insist on the implementation of certain\r\nresolutions, but not of others. We would like to state\r\nthat all Security Council resolutions and positions\r\nshould be implemented on an equal footing, with no\r\ndouble standards. We call for complete respect for the\r\nCharter’s articles, underscoring the obligatory need for\r\nimplementation of all Security Council resolutions by\r\nall States, without exception.\r\nHere we would like to point out the important\r\nrole played by the Council’s 10 elected States and the\r\nneed to foster its work and input. This is particularly\r\nrelevant when we take into account the fact that the\r\nnon-permanent member States represent many views\r\nrelating to the updating of the Council’s mechanisms,\r\nthus making its modus operandi more responsive and\r\nmore transparent in dealing with the political and\r\nsecurity challenges affecting today’s world.\r\nIn the middle of this week, beginning tomorrow,\r\nthe Security Council will discuss the situation between\r\nIraq and Kuwait. This problem has taken on increasing\r\ninternational dimensions and interest. We have listened\r\nto a number of statements indicating that, in spite of\r\nthe sensitive nature of this matter, the Council has thus\r\nfar not discussed the question in open meetings, as the\r\ninternational community has expected.\r\nElected States have so far are not been given a\r\nchance to voice their views or express their positions\r\non draft resolutions being circulated in the mass media\r\nsome days ago. Such media-circulated draft resolutions\r\nwere the main reference to those 10 elected States of\r\nthe Council. I would like to emphasize the need to deal\r\nwith this question within the framework of\r\ninternational law and to resolve the problem peacefully,\r\nin particular since Iraq has, on more than one occasion\r\nand in more than one official document, stated its\r\nreadiness to implement the relevant resolutions to\r\nallow United Nations Monitoring, Verification and\r\nInspection Commission (UNMOVIC) inspectors and\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to\r\nreturn to Iraq in order to carry out their mission\r\nwithout conditions or restrictions.\r\nWe believe that beating the drums of war and the\r\nissuance of threats does not in any way conform to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. Nor does it serve the\r\naspirations of the international community, which\r\ndesires justice and peace.\r\nOnce again, we call upon Iraq to implement all\r\nSecurity Council resolutions relating to the Iraqi\r\nquestion.\r\nWe have already expressed in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group our observations on the issue of\r\nequitable representation in the Council and an increase\r\nin its membership. During the Group’s meeting, we\r\nexpressed our views in numerous statements, and our\r\ndelegation participated actively in the Group. Our\r\ndelegation believes that this Group still constitutes a\r\nviable rostrum for deliberations in order to reach\r\nconsensus on those two sensitive issues.\r\nAlthough the Working Group achieved somewhat\r\ncommendable progress in improving the working\r\nmethods of the Council, it has, regrettably, so far been\r\nunable to achieve any noticeable progress in other\r\nfields, given the difficulties within the Council. The\r\nSyrian delegation, which participated actively in all the\r\nprevious meetings, will exert all efforts to achieve the\r\ndesired progress along the line of the positions adopted\r\nby the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement\r\ncountries. And we will continue our work to build on\r\nthe positive steps taken, and on the views and drafts\r\npresented to the Working Group, which has discussed\r\nthese ideas quite seriously with the aim of achieving\r\nmore democratization in the Council whether in the\r\narea of expanding its membership or in achieving\r\ntransparency in its working methods.\r\nAll proposals and views put forward by\r\ndelegations on this important topic will be respected\r\nand appreciated by our delegation. As a non-permanent\r\nCouncil member, we will do our best to build on the\r\nachievements made in the past period. We will\r\ndemonstrate full cooperation with the other Council\r\nmembers, so as to enable the Council to shoulder its\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, in accordance with the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Iraq.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ninternational community has been working for 57 years\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nto strengthen the United Nations and to bring it into\r\nline with today’s realities. In that context, reform of the\r\nOrganization is a programme of vital importance, and\r\nSecurity Council reform represents one of the main\r\naspects of its modernization.\r\nOur world has changed a lot, particularly over the\r\npast 10 years. That is why is would be naive to believe\r\nthat the Council — which was created in 1945 as a\r\nreflection of the economic, political and demographic\r\ninterests of the victorious States of the Second World\r\nWar — I repeat, it would be naive for us to believe that\r\nwith its present structure and practices, the Council\r\nwould be in keeping with present circumstances.\r\nThe new threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity, such as terrorism and the threat to occupy\r\nStates and change regimes, have ushered us into a new\r\nage that requires that decision-making be a collective\r\nresponsibility rather than serve the interest of a single\r\ngreat Power. The Council has a real need for true\r\nleadership based on objectivity, team spirit and unity of\r\npurpose, to contribute to establishing a world where\r\npeace, understanding, equality and respect will prevail.\r\nThe report under consideration, much as it\r\nreflects objective realities, also points out real dangers.\r\nThe Council did not respond to the voices of the\r\nMember States calling for its reform and for the\r\nmodernization of its work so that it can be more\r\nrepresentative, legitimate, democratic and effective and\r\ncan accommodate greater participation in its work. It is\r\nclear that what is lacking does not concern submitting\r\nproposals, because that is not an impossible matter.\r\nWhat is important is the political will necessary to\r\nachieve the modernization I have referred to.\r\nFor the past 12 years, the Security Council has\r\ndevoted much of its time to discussing the situation in\r\nmy country, Iraq, which is not in keeping with the\r\nCharter or with anything relevant to international peace\r\nand security. Rather, it is in keeping with the wish and\r\ninterests of two individual States that practise\r\nhegemony, I regret to say, without any consideration\r\nfor the humanitarian and legal standards enshrined in\r\nthe Charter or in established rules of international\r\nlegitimacy.\r\nDespite the fact that the resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Security Council against my country have been\r\nunjust, denying the rights of Iraq and of the Iraqi\r\npeople, as established in the Charter, Iraq has,\r\nnonetheless, implemented all those resolutions. Yet the\r\nSecurity Council remains firm in its position. It\r\ncontinues to discuss the Iraqi case behind closed doors,\r\nnot only at closed meetings or informal discussions at\r\nthe United Nations, but also in the capitals of the\r\npermanent members of the Council, completely\r\nsidelining Iraq and the non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil from any discussion involving Iraq.\r\nThe Council has become a special tribunal on\r\nIraq, acting secretly as judge and witness at the same\r\ntime. And it has not stopped there. It has also\r\ndisregarded everything that Iraq has been subjected to\r\nin terms of violations of its sovereignty, independence\r\nand security as a founding Member of this international\r\nOrganization, even though the Council has affirmed its\r\nrespect for all its relevant resolutions adopted since\r\n1990.\r\nIraq has met all its commitments pursuant to the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, particularly\r\nthose related to disarmament. Yet, the American\r\nAdministration has carried out an aggressive campaign\r\nagainst Iraq, accusing Iraq, in a series of lies bandied\r\nabout by highly placed authorities of the American\r\nAdministration, of possessing and developing nuclear,\r\nchemical and biological weapons, and threatening\r\ninternational peace and security, and has issued\r\nstatements by a number of authorities, including\r\nPresident Bush, threatening to occupy Iraq on the\r\npretext that it is a threat to the United States and to\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn the light of my Government’s sincere wish to\r\nfully implement Security Council resolutions, and in\r\nresponse to the calls of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations and Arab nations and friends, including\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Government\r\nof Iraq has agreed to allow the unconditional return of\r\nthe inspectors — a step which was widely welcomed\r\nby the Secretary-General, the members of the Security\r\nCouncil and the international community.\r\nWhen the United States realized that that would\r\ndeny it the opportunity to invade and occupy Iraq, it\r\nprevented the inspectors from returning to Iraq and\r\nbegan to discuss a draft resolution preparing the\r\ngrounds for another war, a resolution which would be\r\ndifficult to implement and thus pave the way for\r\naggression against Iraq.\r\nA few days ago, the American Senate and the\r\nHouse of Representatives adopted a resolution\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nauthorizing President Bush to use armed force against\r\nIraq, an independent State and a Member State of the\r\nUnited Nations, without referring to the United\r\nNations. Immediately after that, a military build-up\r\nbegan inside and outside the region. The intentions of\r\nthe American Administration became even more\r\nevident when it began to discuss, explicitly and\r\nblatantly, military aggression and appointing an\r\nAmerican military governor in Iraq.\r\nIs that not a blatant violation of the Charter and\r\nthe system of international relations that has been\r\nforged over the past 50 years? Should we not consider\r\nsuch an American measure a threat to and a blatant\r\nviolation of international peace and security by a\r\npermanent State member of the Security Council — the\r\nbody responsible for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security? Does that not undermine the very\r\nbasis of international relations, in keeping with the\r\nCharter? Does it not constitute a monopoly of\r\ninternational legitimacy? I leave it to the Assembly to\r\nanswer those questions.\r\nThe very serious nature of the measures that the\r\nAmerican Administration is putting in place in order to\r\ninvade Iraq makes it necessary for the Security Council\r\nto adopt counter-measures to guarantee respect for the\r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of\r\nIraq. If the Council disregards such threats, many other\r\nStates will become the target of occupation aimed at\r\noverturning their regimes. The legality of the measures\r\nundertaken by the Security Council emanates from the\r\nmandate given to the Council by the Member States,\r\nwhich expect the Council to act on their behalf in\r\nmaintaining international peace and security, as is\r\nmade clear in paragraph 1 of Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nThe United States of America and the United\r\nKingdom seem to be trying — through their relations\r\nwith Iraq — to establish a precedent for terrorizing\r\nother States by adopting measures that violate the\r\nCharter. My country places great hope in the collective\r\nwisdom of the members of the Security Council and\r\nthe international community in dealing with this very\r\nserious matter. We hope that they will do so with a\r\nsense of responsibility and courage and prevent the\r\nUnited States and the United Kingdom from\r\nundertaking further acts of aggression against Iraq,\r\nthreatening its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThe tragic development of relations between Iraq\r\nand the Security Council over the past 12 years has\r\nbeen determined by two permanent members of the\r\nCouncil — perhaps even by one. This has greatly\r\nweakened the credibility of the Council and its capacity\r\nto maintain international peace and security and to\r\nprevent conflict.\r\nThe Council is acting in accordance with the\r\nwishes of parties that exercise hegemonic control over\r\nits decision-making. The Council is not acting on\r\nbehalf of the Member States. We blame the Council for\r\nits selectivity in dealing with issues. Such selectivity is\r\nevident not only in the Council’s relationship with Iraq\r\nbut also in the blatant example of the Council’s\r\napproach to the Palestinian question. In that respect the\r\nCouncil has adopted a nonchalant position, given the\r\nmassacres perpetrated daily by the Israeli occupation\r\nforces against the Palestinian people and the disregard\r\nshown for their inalienable rights, especially their right\r\nto self-determination.\r\nThe Security Council has paid no attention to the\r\ntragic situation of the Iraqi people resulting from the\r\ncontinued unjust economic embargo that has led to the\r\ndeath of more than 1.7 million Iraqi citizens — I call\r\nthe attention of the international community to that\r\nfigure — most of them from vulnerable groups,\r\nincluding women, children and the elderly. They have\r\ndied for no other reason than lack of medicine and\r\nfood.\r\nThe United States of America claimed that it\r\nwanted to improve the situation of the Iraqi people, and\r\ncalled for the adoption of a resolution in that respect.\r\nResolution 1409 (2002), which was recently adopted,\r\nwas aimed — so the United States and Britain\r\nclaimed — at alleviating the suffering of the civilian\r\npopulation of Iraq. Yet the resolution provided for\r\nmeasures that place further obstacles in the way of\r\nimplementing contracts for the purchase of medicines\r\nand food. The new mechanisms require the contracts\r\nfor obtaining foodstuffs, including rice and flour, and\r\npharmaceuticals, including chronic and heart-disease\r\nmedicine, to be submitted to disarmament experts from\r\nthe United Nations Monitoring, Verification and\r\nInspection Commission and the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency. I do not know what expertise such\r\nindividuals have in flour, rice and medicine such that\r\nthey can determine whether we should be able to buy\r\nthem or not. All the civilian needs of the Iraqi people,\r\nsuch as machinery and equipment for social and\r\neconomic development, are also submitted to those\r\nexperts.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nThe Security Council has neglected to address\r\nmany of the matters submitted by my Government to\r\nthe Council that fall within its mandate and its\r\nresolutions. The Council has not considered such\r\nissues, even though they go to the very heart of its\r\nresponsibilities under the Charter. The no-fly zones are\r\nnot legal; they have been imposed by the United States\r\nand the United Kingdom without having been provided\r\nfor in any Security Council resolution. Indeed, they\r\ncontravene the ceasefire conditions of the notorious\r\nresolution 687 (1991), as do the continuous raids by\r\nAmerican and British aircraft in those and other zones\r\nand the daily violation of Iraqi airspace. Raids,\r\ndestruction, bombings and killings are taking place on\r\na daily basis before the very eyes of the Security\r\nCouncil, and no one lifts a finger.\r\nSuch neglect is not limited to the Security\r\nCouncil, but also extends to the bodies that the Council\r\nhas established. Even the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait\r\nObservation Mission, which is operating in the\r\ndemilitarized zone between the two countries and\r\nwhose mandate is to record and report any violations,\r\nhas not informed the Security Council of the violations\r\nof that zone committed by American and British planes\r\non a daily basis, although it has admitted that that such\r\nviolations are taking place. It acknowledges that there\r\nare such planes, but says that it does not know and\r\ncannot determine their identity. Such planes fly in that\r\nzone and even in Iraqi airspace around the clock.\r\nThose actions do, indeed, constitute a violation of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and blatant aggression\r\nagainst a State Member of the United Nations. They\r\nrepresent a violation of the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq as well as of the integrity of a United\r\nNations peacekeeping operation.\r\nAs for the sanctions, the topic of the age, even\r\nthough we are fully convinced that they are neither\r\nlegal nor legitimate, my country regrets the fact that\r\nthe Security Council does not at least periodically\r\nassess the nefarious consequences of these inhuman\r\nmeasures on the civilian population.\r\nNo time frame has been established for the\r\nsanctions, and Article 50 of the Charter has not been\r\nmade operative, and therefore some States are adopting\r\nunilateral measures to punish States that may not agree\r\nwith their stance, such as the Sudan, Libya, Iran and\r\nothers.\r\nThe notorious Committee established pursuant to\r\nresolution 661 (1991) continues to work very secretly,\r\nnot allowing any participation by Iraq in its work,\r\neither directly or indirectly, even though the Committee\r\ndeals only with the basic needs and livelihood of the\r\nIraqi people — food and medicine. The Committee\r\ntakes its decisions on the basis of the political interests\r\nof some States; everyone knows this.\r\nWhere is the justice, the transparency and the\r\ncredibility in the Committee’s work? We are still\r\nwaiting for approval of the lists prepared by the Office\r\nof the Iraq Programme, in consultation with the United\r\nNations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection\r\nCommission (UNMOVIC) and the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which are referred to\r\nas the “blue lists”. They used to be called the “green\r\nlists”. We are now waiting for the “red lists”. They\r\nhave been greatly delayed because of the objections of\r\nthe American and British representatives.\r\nIn addition to what those two representatives\r\nhave done in dealing with the memorandum of\r\nunderstanding on oil for food, they have also delayed\r\ncontracts and priced Iraqi oil retroactively, which has\r\nled to a reduction in export rates and consequently to a\r\ndecline in programme revenues, with more than 1,240\r\ncontracts left unimplemented.\r\nThe Security Council has not devoted sufficient\r\nattention to peace and security, which form the very\r\ncore of its mandate, in keeping with the Charter and\r\nwith international law. That is why we say sincerely\r\nand explicitly that the Council has failed dismally.\r\nOne single member of the Council has made the\r\nPalestinian question impossible to resolve, even from\r\nthe humanitarian point of view. The Palestinian people\r\nare struggling to free their land and to recover their\r\nrights. If the Council cannot offer them any\r\nhumanitarian protection, how can the international\r\ncommunity have faith that the Security Council will\r\nfind a political solution to the Palestinian problem in\r\naccordance with the Charter and international law?\r\nIraq’s position concerning the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council can be summed up as follows. First,\r\nthe veto right should be limited and then phased out,\r\nbecause it is not in keeping with the principle of\r\nequality among States as embodied in the Charter.\r\nSecond, the non-permanent members of the\r\nCouncil have been totally marginalized, and their\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\npresence is often but a formality. They must be allowed\r\nto play an effective role, because they represent most\r\nof the peoples and the regions of the world, and they\r\nmust participate in all the negotiations and\r\ndeliberations of the Council as well as in decision-\r\nmaking.\r\nThird, rules and measures should be adopted that\r\nwould guarantee transparency and justice as well as\r\nrespect for the rights of States.\r\nFourth, the Council’s membership should be\r\nexpanded so as to ensure a democratic representation\r\nof the international community.\r\nFifth, the Council, as an executive political organ,\r\nshould not take decisions of a legislative nature. This is\r\nthe mandate of the General Assembly.\r\nSixth, the International Court of Justice should be\r\nthe one to interpret the Articles of the Charter, and its\r\nmandate should also include monitoring and\r\ninterpreting the Council’s resolutions.\r\nSeventh, the collective international\r\nresponsibility of the Council as one of the institutions\r\nof the United Nations should be affirmed; and the\r\nCouncil should not be used to implement special\r\npolicies that serve the interests of a single State.\r\nEighth, States that are not members of the\r\nCouncil should be informed of Council debates on\r\nresolutions that pertain to peace and security, and the\r\nCouncil’s deliberations be held in the open, without\r\nexception, in order to ensure transparency.\r\nNinth, members of the Council should not vote on\r\nany conflict to which they are a party.\r\nTenth, there should be resort to Chapter VI of the\r\nCharter in the process of conflict resolution as well as\r\ntaking up preventive diplomacy as much as possible\r\nand employing all possible peaceful means to resolve\r\nconflicts between States.\r\nFinally, I should like to congratulate the\r\nrepresentatives of Pakistan, Germany, Spain, Chile and\r\nAngola on their countries’ election as non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Council as of 1 January 2003. We wish\r\nthem every success in carrying out their important\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nGeneral Assembly is addressing two very important\r\nitems on its agenda: “Question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters”, and “Report\r\nof the Security Council”.\r\nThe report on these two items clearly reflects the\r\nextensive and commendable work that has been done\r\nby the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council.\r\nIn this context, I should like to express our deep\r\nappreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo, the outgoing\r\nPresident of the General Assembly during the fifty-\r\nsixth session and Chairman of the Working Group, and\r\nto the Vice-Chairmen, who guided the high-level\r\ndiscussions within the Group.\r\nThe Group’s deliberations have shown that there\r\nis an urgent need to restructure the Council and to\r\nensure greater transparency in its procedures and\r\nworking methods. The studies and working documents\r\nsubmitted by various States, organizations and regional\r\ngroups, as well as by the President’s Office, all agree\r\nthat there is a need to reform the Council to make it\r\nmore interactive and more effective in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security and to enable it better\r\nto meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nNonetheless, despite the agreement in principle\r\namong Members on the required reform following that\r\ndebate, the Working Group was unable to reach\r\nconsensus on the increase in membership or on the\r\nCouncil’s working methods. I regret to note that the\r\ndebate has become repetitious over the past few years.\r\nWe are constantly reiterating the same issues, as if we\r\nwere caught up in a vicious cycle. We are therefore\r\nrequired to set a deadline for agreement on the\r\nnecessary reform of that important organ.\r\nDespite all this, the Group has achieved progress\r\non the Security Council’s working methods. There is\r\nnow almost unanimous agreement on the measures and\r\nproposals to be adopted to amend the Council’s rules of\r\nprocedure. On its own initiative, the Council has\r\nimplemented changes in its methods and procedures\r\nand we note that improvement in the form of the report\r\ncan be used as a basis for further reform in the future.\r\nIn this context, I would draw attention to the\r\nsection on page 5 of the report concerning\r\ndevelopments in Iraq’s implementation of the Council’s\r\nresolutions. This section appears under the heading\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\n“Iraq”, whereas the agenda item is entitled “The\r\nsituation between Iraq and Kuwait”.\r\nKuwait has already had an opportunity to express\r\nits views on the Council expansion, both on its own\r\nbehalf and as a member of the groups to which it\r\nbelongs. Today’s debate offers us yet another chance to\r\nreaffirm our position, as follows.\r\nFirst, Kuwait supports an increase in the Council\r\nmembership so long as the new number is not so\r\nunwieldy as to diminish the Council’s effectiveness and\r\nproficiency in discussions on threats to international\r\npeace and security.\r\nSecondly, the number of members should be in\r\naccordance with the two principles of equal\r\nsovereignty among Member States and equitable\r\ngeographical representation.\r\nThirdly, if an increase in the number of\r\npermanent seats should be agreed, it should be limited\r\nand filled by Member States that, in their relations with\r\nthe United Nations, have demonstrated a capacity to\r\nassume essential responsibilities and to ensure that the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter are followed in\r\nthe political, economic, social and cultural spheres.\r\nThese new members must be elected by the General\r\nAssembly in accordance with procedures to be agreed\r\non.\r\nFourthly, with respect to the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council’s working methods and its relations\r\nwith other United Nations bodies, the General\r\nAssembly in particular, we support all proposals aimed\r\nat conferring greater transparency and clarity on the\r\nCouncil’s work and at facilitating communications with\r\nUnited Nations Members. In this context, we stress the\r\nneed to implement reform of the Security Council’s\r\ndecision-making practices and the proposals agreed by\r\nthe Working Group, without awaiting consensus on\r\nother matters, such as the increase in membership and\r\ncomposition.\r\nFifthly, Kuwait agrees with the proposals on the\r\nelection of non-permanent members, in accordance\r\nwith Article 23 of the Charter, because they would\r\nallow small States, of which we are one, to become\r\nmembers and to contribute to the Council’s work.\r\nSixthly, with respect to the veto and the\r\ncomplexity and sensitive nature of this matter, we note\r\nthat the Group’s discussion reflects a near consensus on\r\nthe need to establish criteria vis-à-vis the use of the\r\nveto. We hope that the proposals made on this issue\r\nwill allow us to achieve a consensus supported by all\r\nMembers.\r\nIn conclusion, we should like to see the Group’s\r\ndiscussions reach a consensus that will reinforce the\r\nSecurity Council’s effectiveness and performance in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security and\r\nin facing the challenges of the new millennium.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): Allow me to express my\r\nGovernment’s deepest condolences to the Government\r\nof Indonesia and to the families of the demised over the\r\ntragic loss of innocent lives in last Saturday’s barbaric\r\nact of violence on the island of Bali. We are still deeply\r\nshocked by this barbaric attack, which deserves our\r\nstrongest condemnation.\r\nI would like to begin by thanking the Security\r\nCouncil, the Secretariat and especially Ambassador\r\nMahbubani of Singapore and his delegation for their\r\ntireless efforts in the preparation of a comprehensive\r\nreport on the work of the Security Council last year.\r\nWe have all noticed that this year’s report is more\r\nconcise and analytical than previous reports. It is\r\ngreatly reduced and more focused, and makes it much\r\neasier to read about and understand the work of the\r\nCouncil in the period covered. We especially welcome\r\nthe analytical approach taken in the introduction.\r\nIt has indeed been a significant and extraordinary\r\nyear for the Security Council, as its workload has been\r\nmuch greater than ever before, not just in the number\r\nof meetings, but also from the substantive point of\r\nview. We welcome the fact that more and more\r\nmeetings of the Security Council are open, thus giving\r\nall the States Members of the United Nations the\r\npossibility to follow closely and to take part in the\r\ndiscussion of important issues under consideration by\r\nthe Council. We welcome the transparent approach of\r\nthe report in presenting the resolutions, statements and\r\nother documents of the Council. However, we wish to\r\nstress our conviction that much more should be done in\r\nthe field of implementation of the resolutions. The\r\ndocument itself is indeed of no great importance if they\r\nare not implemented. It is the Charter of the United\r\nNations that provides for the clear obligation of States\r\nto carry out the Council’s decisions.\r\nLet me touch upon a couple of issues that my\r\ncountry believes have been of the most significant\r\nimportance. First, the quick and decisive action of the\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nSecurity Council following the events of 11 September\r\n2001 has shown us clearly that the Council is capable\r\nof a making a quick and appropriate response. The\r\nestablishment of the Committee pursuant to resolution\r\n1373 (2001) and its work are the right, timely and\r\nbroad response of not just the Council, but, I dare say,\r\nthe international community as a whole to the threat of\r\ninternational terrorism. In this connection, we would\r\nalso like to recognize the significance of the work of\r\nthe Council regarding the question of Afghanistan,\r\nwhere our continued focus and involvement are\r\nneeded, in particular in stabilizing the peace and in a\r\npost-conflict rehabilitation of the whole of Afghan\r\nsociety.\r\nThe area that is of particular interest to my\r\ncountry is South-East Europe. Much progress has been\r\nachieved in recent years and we are glad to note that\r\nless and less of the work of the Security Council is\r\nbeing devoted to the problems in that area. This is good\r\nfor the region and good for the United Nations as a\r\nwhole. It is beyond any doubt that tangible results have\r\nbeen achieved in South-East Europe, also due to United\r\nNations involvement. The results achieved are\r\nstrengthening the perspective and responsibility of the\r\ncountries of the region, which makes overall\r\nstabilization efforts more sustainable.\r\nThis is a positive development in the region and\r\nis rightly reflected in a reduced United Nations\r\npresence. International presence, however, is still\r\nneeded in South-Eastern Europe. This applies to Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, where the European Union is taking\r\nover from 1 January 2003, and in Kosovo, where\r\ncontinued United Nations presence is still needed.\r\nHowever, we are glad to note that the United Nations\r\nMission of Observers in Prevlaka is about to be\r\nconcluded, which reflects a greater responsibility on\r\nthe part of the parties concerned to reach an agreement\r\non Prevlaka issues.\r\nWe welcome the fact that in our discussions on\r\nthe report of the Security Council due attention has\r\nbeen given to the Council’s working methods and the\r\nquestion of transparency. Among the most important\r\nachievements are the meetings of the Council with the\r\ntroop-contributing countries, which enable them to\r\nparticipate in the Council’s work. We are also glad to\r\nnote that the Council has improved its transparency by\r\nholding more open sessions. We commend the briefings\r\nheld by the President of the Council for non-member\r\nStates, and the creation of a web site that is accessible\r\nto all Members. We therefore support a unified policy\r\nof transparency for the benefit of the entire\r\nmembership of the United Nations. We also welcome\r\nthe more frequent visits by members of the Council to\r\nareas under consideration and believe that such\r\nmissions could or should be used as a tool of\r\npreventive diplomacy and thus assist us in turning from\r\na culture of reaction to one of prevention.\r\nWe also would like to stress the importance of the\r\nCouncil taking up matters that may, at first glance, not\r\nseem to be part of its domain, such as the issue of small\r\narms, the protection of civilians and especially children\r\nin armed conflicts, the question of women. In these\r\nmatters it has to cooperate closely with other bodies of\r\nthe United Nations. However, this must not be done to\r\nthe detriment of the responsibility and involvement of\r\nother organs of the United Nations.\r\nLet me now briefly touch upon the question of the\r\nreform of the Security Council. I do not want to sound\r\npessimistic, but I must be realistic. Since the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations and its main\r\nbodies, the world has changed substantially and\r\ndramatically. All of the world’s structures, especially in\r\nthe political, social and economic areas, are very\r\ndifferent from those that existed before. If the Council\r\nwants to achieve its primary goal, it must be\r\nrepresentative, reflecting the membership of the\r\nOrganization and the world community. At present, that\r\nis not the case. I believe that we all agree on the need\r\nto adjust our Organization, particularly the Security\r\nCouncil, so as to reflect the realities of a globalized\r\ninternational community. The Security Council does\r\nnot reflect the reality of today’s world. Consequently, it\r\nshould come as no surprise when problems of the\r\nauthority, legitimacy and effectiveness of the Council\r\nare raised. We need to acknowledge and face the\r\nchallenge of the new realities, and this should include\r\nour common reflection on the relevant provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nThere were great expectations for the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group when it was first established. However,\r\nafter nine years of deliberations, it is time to reach a\r\nconcrete conclusion and try to forge a basic consensus\r\nin order to pave the way forward. We have to admit\r\nthat progress has been made in the area of improved\r\nworking methods and the transparency of the Council,\r\nand much of this has been realized in practice.\r\nHowever, one of the basic questions remains. How will\r\nthis progress and the proposed improvements be\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nreflected in the rules of procedure of the Security\r\nCouncil, which are still provisional? I do not intend to\r\nrepeat Slovenia’s position with regard to the question\r\nof the reforms, for it is well known and has been\r\nexpressed during the sessions of the Working Group.\r\nWe would, in this regard, like to encourage you,\r\nMadam, to take a very active approach in the Open-\r\nended Working Group.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to congratulate the\r\ndelegations of Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and\r\nSpain for their recent election as the new non-\r\npermanent members of the Security Council.\r\nMs. Fogh (Sweden): Let me start by joining other\r\nspeakers in this debate in expressing our condolences\r\nto the Government and people of Indonesia. It was a\r\nhideous act of terrorism that was committed in Bali this\r\npast weekend. Among the many dead and injured were\r\nSwedish nationals and our thoughts are with the many\r\ninjured and affected family members.\r\nThe focus is now on the Security Council. We are\r\nagain being reminded of the enormous responsibility of\r\nthe Council to uphold peace and security. To safeguard\r\nthis important role, a reform is needed to further\r\nstrengthen the Council.\r\nA modern United Nations requires a Security\r\nCouncil that mirrors the realities of today’s\r\ninternational relations. The world is changing and so is\r\nthe United Nations with its growing membership. This\r\nmust be reflected in the composition of the Council.\r\nAll of the 191 Member States must perceive it as being\r\ntruly representative. The credibility and legitimacy of\r\nthe Council are at stake. Therefore, we need to\r\nintensify our efforts to achieve a comprehensive\r\nreform.\r\nAs Members are aware, Sweden has taken an\r\nactive role in the efforts to achieve a far-reaching\r\nreform of the Security Council. We remain committed\r\nto this aim and regard it as one of the most important\r\ntasks facing the United Nations membership as it works\r\nto implement the recommendations in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Indeed, it is a complex issue, but a crucial\r\none for the continued relevance of the Council if it is to\r\nachieve concrete results. In order to emphasize the\r\nlegitimacy of the Security Council, the need for reform\r\nis urgent. This would further strengthen the\r\nOrganization in its most vital role as the guarantor for\r\nprotecting international peace and security. Therefore,\r\nall Member States must now act in a responsible\r\nmanner and show flexibility.\r\nAll efforts should be made to strengthen the\r\nCouncil’s ability to work effectively, negotiate in good\r\nfaith and reach decisions. Necessary actions must not\r\nbe hindered or blocked by a veto or threat thereof.\r\nAs stated on earlier occasions, Sweden favours an\r\nenlargement of the Council to make room for an\r\nincreased representation of Member States, not least\r\nthe developing countries. We also believe that it is of\r\nutmost importance that a reform is met by the broadest\r\npossible support — ideally by consensus. To achieve\r\nthis, Sweden would support a reform process in stages.\r\nA first step would be an enlargement limited to non-\r\npermanent members. At a later stage, Sweden would\r\nnot exclude an increase in permanent members.\r\nThe reform issue has been discussed for many\r\nyears, with little success. However, Sweden would like\r\nyet again to state its commitment to moving the reform\r\nprocess forward. We will continue to work\r\nconstructively in the Open-ended Working Group with\r\nthe primary aim of facilitating an early decision on\r\nenlargement. Progress on this important issue is long\r\noverdue. We hope that all Member States will join the\r\nefforts to create a modern United Nations.\r\nMay I take this opportunity to commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387). Sweden welcomes the\r\nviews presented in the section entitled “Stalled process\r\nof Security Council reform”. Sweden fully agrees with\r\nthe linkage between the Council’s credibility and\r\ninternational peace and security. Consequently, it is in\r\neveryone’s interest to make this important reform a\r\npriority.\r\nAt this point let me also welcome the report of\r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly (A/57/2\r\nand Corr.1). I, like others in this debate, would like to\r\ncommend the members of the Security Council\r\nresponsible for the initiative of the new and more user-\r\nfriendly format of the report, with the analytical\r\nsummary and the substantially decreased number of\r\npages. It is a good example of modernizing United\r\nNations documents.\r\nMr. Hidayat (Indonesia): This meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been convened in the sombre\r\ncontext of the heinous act of terrorism that took place\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nin Bali last weekend. The Government of Indonesia has\r\nstrongly condemned the bombing, which claimed\r\nscores of victims, both Indonesians and foreign\r\nnationals. We wish to reiterate the condolences and\r\ndeep sympathy of the Government of Indonesia to the\r\nfamilies of the bereaved. The authorities are doing their\r\nutmost to investigate that brutal and inhuman act of\r\nviolence and to bring its perpetrators to justice. We\r\nreaffirm Indonesia’s commitment to work with the rest\r\nof the international community to overcome terrorism,\r\nwhich poses a threat to global security. My delegation\r\ntherefore gratefully acknowledges the sentiments of\r\nsympathy that various delegations have expressed to\r\nour Government and our people during this debate.\r\nIt is with appreciation that my delegation has\r\nwelcomed the annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly (A/57/2 and Corr.1). We also\r\nwelcome last session’s report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters related to the\r\nSecurity Council (A/56/47).\r\nFollowing the decision of the Council in May\r\n2002, my delegation has noted the changes in the\r\nformat of the report of the Security Council, which\r\nwere intended to provide the General Assembly with a\r\nmore timely and informative document. We agree that\r\nthe report before us, which covers the period from 16\r\nJune 2001 to 31 July 2002, is more concise and\r\ninformative.\r\nWe are gratified that in its quest for increased\r\ntransparency, the Security Council continued to review\r\nits working methods during that period. In that\r\nconnection, we applaud the increased openness that the\r\nwrap-up sessions have engendered, particularly with\r\nthe participation of non-Council members in February,\r\nMay and June. We hope that this trend will continue.\r\nUnfortunately, while the current report of the\r\nCouncil opens with an analytical segment, we had\r\nhoped for a more substantive, rather than a historical,\r\nrecounting of the events as they happened in the\r\nCouncil during the year. We had expected the kind of\r\npolitical analysis that would not only tell us what we\r\ndo not already know but also go below the surface to\r\npoint out trends, rationales and justifications in the\r\nwork of the Council. The eight pages that are dedicated\r\nto the analytical summary in the current report have not\r\nmet that expectation, and we hope that this will be\r\nimproved in the future.\r\nNeedless to say, the way in which the Council\r\nreports is no less important than its reform and\r\nreconstitution. On this issue, I wish to point out that in\r\nthe segment of the analytical summary concerning the\r\nworking methods of the Council, reference is made to\r\nthe increase in the number of meetings that were held\r\nin public during the year, as well as to the briefings to\r\nnon-members by Presidents of the Council. My\r\ndelegation welcomes that trend and commends\r\nmembers of the Council for making it possible. We\r\nlook forward to the momentum being sustained. Its\r\ncontinuance is a step forward and represents progress\r\ntowards greater openness in the Council’s\r\ndeliberations, which has been one of the concerns of\r\nthe majority of Member States. It is, however,\r\nimportant that efforts be made to ensure that the views\r\nexpressed by non-members be considered in the\r\ndrafting of resolutions and of presidential statements.\r\nOne question may be asked at this point: why do\r\nnon-members join in open meetings of the Council? If\r\none may venture an answer, it is not because they want\r\nto have their statements entered in the record books.\r\nWhen non-members go there to offer their views on\r\nissues of peace and security, it is often because they\r\nwant those views taken into consideration by Council\r\nmembers, who are in a position to convert them into\r\npolicy.\r\nHowever, that may not be the practice of the\r\nmeetings of the Security Council, particularly considering\r\nthat in the structure of its work, an open meeting\r\ninvariably comes after informal consultations — usually a\r\nseries of informal consultations — at which a draft\r\nresolution or a presidential statement may have been\r\nprepared for adoption. Hence, the views of non-\r\nmembers of the Security Council are not properly\r\nreflected in Council decisions.\r\nWe deem it advisable that non-members of the\r\nSecurity Council be given the opportunity to speak\r\nprior to the informal consultations on a particular\r\nsubject to allow them to express their views, followed\r\nby the members of the Council, who will speak in the\r\nconcluding discussion, since they will have engaged in\r\ninformal consultations on the issue. That kind of\r\narrangement is realistic in another regard: the\r\nstatements of Council members would then logically\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nand immediately be followed by the adoption of the\r\nresolution or presidential statement.\r\nThe further strengthening of the Council’s\r\ndynamic interaction with the main organ of the United\r\nNations, the General Assembly, has emerged as one of\r\nthe important questions in the context of the overall\r\nreform of the Organization. The Council’s reporting on\r\nits work to the Assembly, despite its importance, does\r\nnot suffice; rather, more substantive relations have\r\nbecome imperative. In that context, we recall several\r\nitems that were deliberated on and decided by the\r\nSecurity Council during the period of this report,\r\nincluding issues such as HIV/AIDS. The work of the\r\nCouncil in dealing with many of those problems should\r\nbe structured in such a way as to maximize the work\r\nand the role of the Assembly on the issues, as\r\nmandated by the Charter.\r\nI would now like to turn to the broader subject of\r\nSecurity Council reform. Seven years after the General\r\nAssembly first established the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on this issue, the Millennium Declaration, in\r\n2000, called on us to intensify our efforts to achieve a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. That instruction was arrived at in recognition\r\nof the reality that, despite prolonged deliberations in\r\nthe Working Group, we have moved no closer to an\r\nagreement on any of the substantive issues. Those\r\nunresolved questions will have to be addressed in order\r\nto enhance the Council’s credibility and moral\r\nauthority. As the Secretary-General has rightly\r\nremarked in his report entitled “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387), the reform of the United Nations would be\r\nincomplete without reform of the Security Council.\r\nLast June, the Working Group concluded its work\r\nfor the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly,\r\nhaving decided to recommend consideration of the\r\nagenda item at this session and that to recommend the\r\nWorking Group should continue with its work.\r\nAs I have indicated, Indonesia acknowledges the\r\nprovisional agreement reached on a number of issues\r\nconcerning the working methods of the Council. We\r\nare, however, disappointed at the failure to narrow the\r\nsubstantial differences on other issues.\r\nIn the view of Indonesia, the time has come for us\r\nto make progress. We hope that the objective — which\r\nis to reform the Council comprehensively so as to make\r\nit into an organ that is transparent, democratic,\r\nrepresentative and effective in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security — will continue to\r\nguide our work. If we put that objective before\r\nnarrower national or group interests, it will increase the\r\npossibility that we will reach speedier agreement on the\r\nsubstantive questions.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to express its\r\nsincere congratulations to Angola, Chile, Germany,\r\nPakistan and Spain on their election as non-permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council for 2003 and 2004.\r\nWe are convinced that they will make concrete\r\ncontributions to the work of the Council.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): First of all, I should like to express the deep\r\nsympathy and condolences of the Government and the\r\npeople of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Indonesia and to the\r\nGovernments and the peoples of other countries that\r\nlost citizens in the recent bomb blast in Bali. We\r\ncondemn that terrorist attack in the strongest terms, and\r\nwe hope that the perpetrators will be brought to trial.\r\n It has been nearly 10 years since the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform was\r\ncreated, and, as another year passes without a solution,\r\nwe must say that many of us are getting a bit frustrated,\r\nimpatient and weary. It could even be argued that we\r\nhave reached an impasse — a point at which we are\r\nquestioning whether a further exercise devoted to\r\ntackling this very difficult and convoluted issue is\r\nwarranted. However, in the light of old and new threats\r\nto international peace and security, the significant role\r\nof the Security Council and the need to reform the\r\nCouncil so that it reflects today’s global realities have\r\nnever been more relevant. Hence, we must do\r\neverything we can to find an acceptable solution to the\r\ncrucial question of reform.\r\nThe Working Group was created to examine key\r\nquestions related to the reorganization of this important\r\norgan of the United Nations. The issues concerning the\r\nSecurity Council’s working methods, its decision-\r\nmaking processes and the expansion of its membership\r\nare those to which most Member States have paid the\r\ngreatest attention. Making the Council more effective\r\nby making it more representative, more transparent and\r\nmore democratic is, and always has been, the primary\r\naim of this entire exercise.\r\nAs is well known, the position of the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic on the question of\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nexpanding the membership of the Council is similar to\r\nthat of the majority of Member States. We favour\r\nincreasing both the permanent and the non-permanent\r\ncategories of membership. Furthermore, in line with\r\nthe positions and the repeated appeals of other Non-\r\nAligned Movement countries, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic stresses that, in order to be\r\neffective, any Council reform should also include\r\nmeasures to make the Council more transparent in its\r\nworking methods, especially in its decision-making\r\nprocess. We believe that such transparency would not\r\nonly boost the confidence of Member States but would\r\nalso allow all of us to better understand the merits of\r\nthe Council’s decisions and to fully support them.\r\nFinally, in this new age, most of us appear to be\r\nin agreement that the veto power of selected members\r\nof the Security Council is anachronistic, anti-\r\ndemocratic and discriminatory; yet we continue to\r\nwitness the existence of that power today. Thus, in our\r\neffort to reform and to reorganize the Council, we must\r\nmake the curtailment and eventual abolition of the right\r\nof veto a priority. Fully cognizant of the sensitivity and\r\ncomplexity of this issue, however, we should like to\r\nsay that, in the spirit of compromise, a solution that is\r\nacceptable to all should be found.\r\nNumerous changes have occurred since the\r\ninception of the United Nations in 1945. It is\r\nregrettable that the Security Council has not adapted to\r\nthose changes fast enough. Many wars and conflicts are\r\nraging across our planet, and we cannot afford to hope\r\nthat a Council characterized as unrepresentative and\r\nnot transparent will be effective in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. Therefore, we should\r\npatiently pursue our efforts to reform the Council, the\r\nbody charged with the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, in order to make it more credible\r\nand more legitimate.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the GUUAM participating States,\r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of\r\nMoldova and my country, Ukraine.\r\nAt the outset, I should like to join my colleagues\r\nin conveying our deepest and most heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims of the\r\nmalicious and barbaric terrorist act carried out in Bali\r\non 12 October 2002, and to the people and Government\r\nof the Republic of Indonesia for the tragic losses that it\r\ncaused. This shocking event has, once again,\r\nunderlined the need for consolidation in the efforts of\r\nthe entire international community in its fight against\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nLet me express our gratitude to the President of\r\nthe Security Council, Ambassador Martin Belinga-\r\nEboutou, of Cameroon, for presenting the annual report\r\nof the Council to the General Assembly. I trust the\r\nAssembly will agree that the annual report and its\r\nanalytical innovations, together with the document\r\nprepared by the Secretariat on procedural developments\r\nin the Council in the year 2001 (S/2002/603), answered\r\na number of important questions and raised new ones\r\nworth thinking about. Indeed, despite the routine\r\npractice of slinging arrows at the Council, we\r\nacknowledge the appearance of positive and\r\nencouraging tendencies in strengthening the Council’s\r\ninternational role and improving its working methods.\r\nThe statistics show a significant increase in the\r\nintensity of the Council’s activities last year. The body\r\nhas been gradually expanding and diversifying its\r\nagenda, being deeply involved in a wide range of\r\nissues, from the fight against terrorism, to conflict\r\nprevention and peace-building, to the protection of\r\ncivilians and United Nations personnel in conflicts, and\r\nso forth.\r\nThe Council tried to keep on the consensus track.\r\nDespite disappointments and setbacks, the unity\r\napproach prevailed, testifying to the willingness of the\r\nCouncil member States to respond adequately to global\r\nsecurity demands.\r\nThe Council effectively continued applying\r\ncreative innovations — so to say — in its work,\r\nbuilding on the trend towards greater transparency and\r\nbetter working methods. Although there have been only\r\nsix meetings of the Working Group on procedures and\r\nworking methods, the final outcome deserves our\r\nsupport and encouragement.\r\nHere we cannot but mention an increase in the\r\ntotal of open meetings, more active dialogue with other\r\nUnited Nations bodies and Member States, and a wider\r\nuse of the latest information technologies that have\r\nhelped to speed up the delivery of information to\r\nvarious audiences in the United Nations. This is\r\nespecially important in view of the close link between\r\naccountability and transparency of the Council. United\r\nNations Member States have had more opportunities to\r\nparticipate in the deliberations of the Council and have\r\nhad a greater chance to influence some of its decisions.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nVisible results have been achieved in improving\r\nthe consultation mechanisms between the troop-\r\ncontributing countries, the Council and the Secretariat.\r\nIt is our deep conviction that this triangular\r\ncooperation, based on partnership and respect, is an\r\nindispensable element for conducting peacekeeping\r\noperations in the most effective manner.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that much of what has\r\nbeen achieved by the Council can be attributed to the\r\nperseverance and innovative thinking of non-\r\npermanent members, who, like fresh blood, enter the\r\nbody with new ideas, new thoughts, new energy and\r\nthe desire to contribute significantly to the Council’s\r\nwork.\r\nThus, our key message is clear: the GUUAM\r\nparticipating States (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan,\r\nAzerbaijan, Moldova) support the ideology and\r\npractice of change, as demonstrated by the Council,\r\nand we believe that its improved performance in the\r\ninternational arena will further stimulate the overall\r\nreform of the world Organization, inspired and\r\npromoted by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\r\nThe period under review was marked by a wide\r\nrange of dramatic events. To name just a few, the 11\r\nSeptember terrorist attacks against the United States,\r\nthe challenge of bringing stability to Afghanistan, the\r\nsecurity problems in Kosovo, Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, the lack of progress in the settlement of\r\nconflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, the increasing and\r\npersistent violence in the Middle East, instability in\r\nAfrica and the situation in Timor-Leste in its move to\r\nindependence. And, it would not be an exaggeration to\r\nsay that the Security Council appeared to be much\r\nmore consolidated and effective in dealing with these\r\nimportant issues.\r\nAmong its major achievements, I would like first\r\nof all to mention the counter-terrorism efforts of the\r\nCouncil. The response to the 11 September attacks is,\r\nin our view, an example of how strong and efficient the\r\nCouncil’s action can be if the body is united and\r\nresolute. The GUUAM participating States are\r\nconfident that the Security Council should further play\r\na central role in our common struggle against\r\nterrorism. In this context, the role of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee cannot be overestimated.\r\nDuring the reporting period, real progress was\r\nmade by the Security Council in bringing peace to\r\nAfghanistan, in ensuring a smooth transition of Timor-\r\nLeste to independence, in strengthening stability in the\r\nBalkans and in introducing new approaches to African\r\nconflicts.\r\nWith regard to Afghanistan, we consider it highly\r\nimportant that the Council continues to closely follow\r\ndevelopments on the ground. The current situation in\r\nthe country requires a new, comprehensive strategy of\r\npractical support, aimed at improving the security\r\nconditions and facilitating the reconstruction processes.\r\nWith regard to the Balkans, we wish to endorse\r\nthe Council’s approach in encouraging more active\r\ninvolvement of the European actors in the stabilization\r\nprocesses in Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the fragile\r\nsecurity situation in the region, and a wide range of\r\nunsettled problems, demand the active involvement and\r\nclose attention of the United Nations and, specifically,\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the Council\r\nsucceeded in making a major shift in its overall policy\r\ntowards Africa. The establishment of the ad hoc\r\nworking group on conflict prevention and resolution in\r\nAfrica is a landmark step, and we count on the\r\nproductive work of the group, in close cooperation with\r\nother United Nations bodies and regional and\r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nWe welcome positive developments in Africa,\r\nincluding elections in Sierra Leone, the delimitation\r\ndecision by the Boundary Commission on Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, the signing of an agreement between UNITA\r\nand the Government of Angola and agreements\r\nbetween the Government of the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo and Rwanda and Uganda.\r\nAt the same time, against this optimistic\r\nbackground, we would like to express concern over\r\nsome other issues. In particular, GUUAM is most\r\ndisappointed with the lack of progress in the settlement\r\nof the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia. In December of\r\nlast year, some hope emerged after the Group of\r\nFriends of the Secretary-General on Georgia, and later\r\nthe Security Council, endorsed the document on the\r\nbasic principles for the distribution of competencies\r\nbetween Tbilisi and Sukhumi. However, for almost a\r\nyear, the Abkhaz side has continued to brazenly refuse\r\nto accept the paper, despite the fact that the Council\r\ntwice urged it to do so in its resolutions 1393 (2001)\r\nand 1427 (2002).\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nIn general, I would like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to the problem of so-called frozen conflicts,\r\nwhich were left as unhealed wounds in the newly\r\nindependent States that emerged in the territory of the\r\nformer Soviet Union. The international community\r\ncannot turn a blind eye to the lack of progress in the\r\nsettlement of conflicts in Abkhazia; Georgia; Nagorno\r\nKarabakh; Azerbaijan; or Trans-Dniester, Republic of\r\nMoldova, which have been destabilizing the situation\r\nin the whole region for a decade.\r\nRegarding the Middle East, having adopted\r\nhistoric resolution 1397 (2001), which affirmed the\r\nvision of a region where two States, Israel and\r\nPalestine, live side by side within secure and\r\nrecognized borders, the Council established a clear\r\npolitical perspective for achieving a just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East. In its\r\nsubsequent resolutions on the issue, namely 1402\r\n(2002), 1403 (2002), 1405 (2002) and, most recently,\r\n1435 (2002), the Council clearly spelled out its\r\ndemands for the immediate steps to be taken by the\r\nparties to move towards that goal. It is really\r\nunfortunate that those resolutions were followed on the\r\nground with intensifying violence and terror, further\r\ncomplicating the work of the Security Council.\r\nRegarding the Iraqi problem, the adoption of the\r\nnew mechanism for processing civilian exports to Iraq\r\nin resolution 1409 (2002) was widely recognized as a\r\npositive step to improve the flow of goods, while\r\nmaintaining necessary controls on dual-use and other\r\nmilitary-related items. However, that achievement was\r\nalso shadowed by a wide range of negative\r\ndevelopments. In that context, we wish to reiterate our\r\nstrong belief that all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions should be implemented in full.\r\nOur countries are also relying on the ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to peacefully resolve the Iraqi problem,\r\nwhich has already become one of the most crucial\r\nchallenges before the Council.\r\nFinally, regarding the issue of sanctions, though\r\nthe Working Group on sanctions was originally\r\nscheduled to report its findings to the Council by\r\nNovember 2002, unfortunately, it still has not been able\r\nto reach final consensus.\r\nWe wish to encourage the Security Council to\r\nmake additional efforts to achieve a compromise\r\nsolution or to find other ways of ensuring that a\r\ncomprehensive outcome of the deliberations within the\r\nWorking Group on sanctions do not remain hostage to a\r\nfew, albeit important, issues.\r\nThe GUUAM participating States have always\r\nattached special importance to the Charter powers of\r\nthe Security Council and have consistently taken a firm\r\nstand on enhancing its authority as a nucleus of the\r\nglobal security system. Our countries are guided by the\r\nstrong determination to contribute to preserving the\r\nkey role of the Council in that area and to enhancing its\r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness.\r\nWhen evaluating Council activities of recent\r\nyears from a broad perspective, we may find many\r\nreasons to characterize them as being the beginning of\r\na new chapter in the history of this body. We hope that\r\nthat chapter will be marked by greater credibility,\r\nopenness and responsiveness of the Council to the\r\nexpectations of the Member States.\r\nOur delegation believes that important\r\ninnovations that have appeared in the Council’s work\r\nduring the last few years will finally become normal\r\npractice. Further expansion of dialogue between the\r\nCouncil and regional and subregional organizations is\r\nalso a priority task.\r\nOur delegation encourages the Council to\r\ncontinue the practice of sending special missions to\r\nconflict regions, which provides an opportunity to\r\nassess directly the developments on the ground. In our\r\nview, sending assessment expert groups of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee should be also considered. In\r\ngeneral, the ability of United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions to identify and counter terrorist threats, as\r\nrecommended by the United Nations Policy Working\r\nGroup, should be enhanced in every way. We also fully\r\nsupport the view that the Council should meet\r\nperiodically for a strategic review of its work.\r\nFinally, let me reiterate that there is growing\r\nrecognition, including within the Security Council, that\r\noverall reforms are indeed indispensable if the Council\r\nwants to respond to the demands of our times.\r\nI would like to conclude by offering our\r\ncongratulations to Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan\r\nand Spain on their recent election to the Security\r\nCouncil for 2003 and 2004. Our delegations are\r\nlooking forward to close and productive cooperation\r\nwith the newly elected members of the Council and\r\nwish them every success in discharging their very\r\nimportant responsibilities.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nMr. Pak Gil Yon (Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea): Let me first express my thanks to\r\nAmbassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou of Cameroon for\r\nhaving introduced the annual report on the work of the\r\nSecurity Council and to the Secretariat for its\r\npreparation of the report.\r\nSubmission by the Security Council of an annual\r\nreport on its work to the General Assembly is a good\r\npractice that serves to increase contact and\r\ncollaboration between the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council and to consider recommendations for\r\nimproving its work on the basis of an analysis of the\r\nwork of the Council.\r\nThe report of the Council presented at this session\r\nshows some improvement in its work, compared with\r\nprevious years, but it still does not meet the\r\nexpectations of the Member States.\r\nAs we review the Security Council’s work of the\r\npast year, we find that the majority of issues were\r\ndiscussed within the informal format and that its open\r\nmeetings were held only to adopt resolutions already\r\nagreed upon behind closed doors. That reality presents\r\nserious problems to Member States, given the\r\ndistinctive characteristics of the Security Council and\r\nthe fact that the most important issues regarding peace\r\nand security are dealt with by only a few countries.\r\nIn order for the Security Council to fulfil its\r\nmission properly, it should carry out its obligations to\r\nensure international peace and security in good faith, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter. Above all, the Council should\r\nshow transparency in all its deliberations and should\r\nmake sure that no resolution is adopted for the political\r\nobjectives of a specific country.\r\nThe Security Council should discuss all issues in\r\nopen meetings on a just and fair basis, confine informal\r\nconsultations to procedural matters only and, when it\r\nholds informal consultations, it should invite the\r\nparties concerned to those consultations so that they\r\ncan fully present their views.\r\nIn particular, when the Security Council adopts\r\nresolutions on sanctions or the use of force, it should\r\nmake it a rule to submit to the General Assembly\r\nspecial reports with the background and content of the\r\nresolutions at the earliest date possible, in conformity\r\nwith the relevant Article of the Charter.\r\nThe Security Council should also take steps to\r\nprevent individual Member States from using or\r\nthreatening to use force against other Member States\r\nwithout reference to an explicit United Nations\r\nresolution or by invoking coercive power. The Security\r\nCouncil should deal with the challenges to peace and\r\nsecurity in a just and determined way, keeping abreast\r\nof the requirements of the reality.\r\nThere is no legal ground for the presence of the\r\nso-called United Nations Command on the Korean\r\npeninsula, given either the process of adoption of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolution or the relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and the so-called United\r\nNations Command. The United Nations does not\r\nexercise any power politically, militarily or financially\r\nover the so-called United Nations Command in Korea,\r\nwhich does not really exist for a United Nations ideal,\r\nbut rather for the interests of a country. Such forces\r\ncannot be called a United Nations force.\r\nMy delegation underlines its expectation that the\r\nSecurity Council will, in conformity with the demands\r\nand aspirations of the new century for genuine peace\r\nand security, pay due attention to redressing the\r\nabnormal situation in which the name and flag of the\r\nUnited Nations have been abused for more than 50\r\nyears.\r\nIf the Security Council is to improve and\r\nstrengthen its work in accordance with the\r\nrequirements of the current reality, it should be\r\ndecisively reformed. A prerequisite for the desired\r\nreform of the Security Council is that every Member\r\nState must have a clear position on the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the reform.\r\nThe core issue of Security Council reform is to\r\nmake the work of the Security Council more just and\r\ndemocratic. The fair and democratic nature of the\r\nCouncil can be ensured only when representation of the\r\ndeveloping countries is increased. In Council reform,\r\npriority should be given to properly addressing the\r\nimplicit denial of the voices of developing countries.\r\nImportant consideration should also be given to\r\nissues at closed meetings, the relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly and\r\nregular review of the work of the Council.\r\nAll reform matters of the Council should be\r\ndecided by consensus through the full participation of\r\nand negotiation by all Member States. Pressure and\r\narbitrariness should not in any way be permitted. If it is\r\ndifficult to agree on all issues at once, then issues\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\neasily agreed could be discussed first. Security Council\r\nreform should be part of the general reform work of the\r\nUnited Nations and should be discussed accordingly in\r\ncombination with revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Council will be able to discharge its mission\r\nof ensuring world peace and security, settling\r\ndisputes — large or small — in a fair manner, and\r\npreventing the arbitrariness of the strong in oppressing\r\nthe weak by force when it is made democratic, in\r\naccordance with the aspirations of the majority of the\r\nMember States and present realities.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): I wish first to extend our\r\nsincere condolences to the Government of Indonesia, as\r\nwell as to all the bereaved families who suffer greatly\r\nbecause of the senseless and dastardly act of terrorism\r\nin Bali.\r\nThe joint debate on agenda item 11 and agenda\r\nitem 40 gives us an opportunity to review the Council’s\r\ntrack record and to clarify our thinking on that\r\nimportant organ of the United Nations.\r\nPlease allow me to begin by expressing our\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to Ambassador Martin\r\nBelinga-Eboutou, President of the Security Council for\r\nthe month of October, for his introduction of the\r\nCouncil’s annual report to the Assembly. I also wish to\r\npay tribute to the work done by his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, and Ambassador\r\nThorsteinn Ingolfsson of Iceland and Ambassador\r\nPatricia Durrant, Vice-Chairpersons of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council Reform, for their\r\ntireless efforts on this very important issue.\r\nMyanmar, as a strong advocate of multilateralism,\r\ntakes special interest in the report of the Council.\r\nSubmitted under Article 24 of the Charter, that report\r\ncontinues to serve as a vital link between the two main\r\nbodies — the General Assembly, where 191 sovereign\r\nStates are represented, and the Security Council, five\r\npermanent and ten non-permanent members, entrusted\r\nby Member States with the crucial responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nLast year, my delegation together with many\r\nothers, pointed out that to be of greater value, the\r\nCouncil’s report should provide a timely, detailed,\r\ncomplete and analytical account of its work. We are\r\nhappy to see the improved format of this year’s report,\r\nwhich provides us with an analytical account of the\r\nCouncil’s work in its introductory part. For that, I wish\r\nto express our appreciation to Ambassador Mahbubani\r\nand his team for their valuable contribution. I would\r\nlike to urge the Council to build upon that improved\r\nformat, and I hope that in future, the analytical part of\r\nthe report will be strengthened.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the Council has\r\ncontinued the measures to lend greater transparency to\r\nits work, particularly the periodic wrap-up sessions. We\r\nalso appreciate that many more meetings were held in\r\npublic. The informal briefings on the work of the\r\nCouncil by several monthly Presidents to non-members\r\nnot only increased transparency but also imparted a\r\nsense of inclusiveness. We particularly appreciate the\r\ndecision by the Council to hold an open meeting to\r\ndiscuss the report before its submission to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe would greatly welcome more open meetings\r\nof the Council. Here we should remind ourselves that\r\nopen meetings of the Council used to be the rule rather\r\nthan the exception it is today. We Members of the\r\nUnited Nations have conferred upon the Council the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We have also agreed\r\nto abide by and to carry out the decisions of the\r\nCouncil. Therefore, it is only fitting that the views of\r\nthe general membership be taken into considerations on\r\nimportant issues that affect us all. Such a course of\r\naction will also contribute to the successful\r\nimplementation of Council decisions. The successful\r\nimplementation of Council decisions clearly needs the\r\nfull and wholehearted support of all Members of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nConcerning the substantive side of the report, it\r\ncan be easily seen that the work of the Security Council\r\nwas greatly affected by the events of 11 September.\r\nThe Council assumed new major responsibilities with\r\nthe adoption of its resolution 1373 (2001) and the\r\nestablishment of the Counter-Terrorism Committee in\r\nthe wake of 11 September. By acting decisively and\r\nunanimously, the Council has demonstrated the value\r\nand the relevance of multilateralism.\r\nResolution 1373 (2001) imposed binding\r\nobligations on all Member States to prevent and\r\nsuppress terrorism. The Counter-Terrorism Committee,\r\nunder the chairmanship of Ambassador Greenstock,\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nably monitored the implementation of that resolution.\r\nMyanmar has taken the necessary legislative and\r\nexecutive measures to give effect to the resolution. The\r\nreports required of us have also been submitted. I\r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to reiterate the\r\nfirm commitment of Myanmar against terrorism and\r\nour resolve to fully cooperate with the international\r\ncommunity in the area of counter-terrorism.\r\nI also wish to express appreciation for the\r\nvaluable briefings that we were given by the Chairman\r\nof the Committee over the reporting period.\r\nAllow me to make a few comments on the reform\r\nof the Security Council. The Council is at the centre of\r\nour system of collective security. We, therefore, would\r\nlike to see a Council that is more representative, more\r\ntransparent and more democratic.\r\nMore than 150 heads of State and Government\r\nunanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration and\r\nresolved to intensify efforts for a comprehensive\r\nreform of the Security Council. However, the report\r\nsubmitted by the Open-ended Working Group clearly\r\nshowed that there had been little progress regarding\r\ncritical issues, such as increased membership and the\r\nquestion of veto. My delegation is heartened, however,\r\nby the fact that the majority of the members of the\r\nWorking Group favour the view that the use of veto be\r\nlimited to matters taken up under Article VII of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMyanmar has had the opportunity to outline its\r\nposition on the reform of the Security Council on\r\nseveral past occasions. We would like once again to\r\ncaution against the temptation to resort to partial\r\nsolutions. If we were to agree to an expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council in one category and to make only\r\nartificial changes in its working methods, we would not\r\nbe addressing the main issues. We would only be\r\nbypassing them and perpetuating an international\r\nsystem marked by inequity. The Non-Aligned\r\nMovement has consistently held the view that the\r\nexpansion and the reform of the Security Council\r\nshould be an integral part of the common package. We\r\nfully subscribe to that view. Cluster I and cluster II\r\nissues are equally important and need to be considered\r\ntogether. Any final decisions on the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should be in the form of a package\r\nagreement consisting of expanded Council\r\nmembership, in both permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories, and a comprehensive set of recommended\r\nmeasures to be institutionalized by the Council, so as\r\nto reform the procedures of the Council for greater\r\ntransparency and the participation of Member States in\r\nits decision-making process.\r\nThe successful outcome of our efforts for a\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council is vital\r\nto all of us. The impasse at which we find ourselves\r\ncould only be overcome by greater political will on the\r\npart of those concerned. It is our hope that realism will\r\nprevail and that our aspiration for a more\r\nrepresentative, more transparent and more democratic\r\nCouncil will not be the vision of a distant future, but a\r\ncherished reality.\r\nFinally, I wish to extend my delegation’s sincere\r\ncongratulations to Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan\r\nand Spain on their election as non-permanent members\r\nof the Council for 2003 and 2004. We wish them every\r\nsuccess as they work to bring about peace and security\r\nto the international community.\r\nMr. Valdes (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to\r\nbegin Chile’s statement by expressing my delegation’s\r\nappreciation to the President of the Security Council,\r\nAmbassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou of Cameroon, for\r\nhis introduction of the annual report of the Council to\r\nthe General Assembly, pursuant to Articles 15 and 24\r\nof the Charter.\r\nI also thank those delegations that have spoken\r\nbefore me for their congratulations extended to Chile\r\non its upcoming membership in the Security Council.\r\nWe also reiterate our wishes for success in that\r\nimportant role to Anglola, Germany, Pakistan and\r\nSpain.\r\nWe join in the condolences expressed to the\r\nGovernments of Indonesia and Australia because of the\r\ntragic events that occurred recently on the island of\r\nBali. That dastardly attack proves the global nature of\r\nterrorism and confirms the need to maintain the unity\r\nof this Organization.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the report that we\r\nare addressing today is presented in a new format\r\nreflecting the opinions expressed by the General\r\nAssembly on this subject at its fifty-sixth session. It\r\nalso records certain progress in the right direction by\r\nincluding in the introduction a brief analysis of the\r\nCouncil’s work during the period under review.\r\nNonetheless, there is still a way to go before attaining\r\nthe desired goal, which is to have clear and accurate\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nindicators of the progress made by the Council and a\r\nsection with proposals for improving the working\r\nmethods. The current presentation still maintains a\r\nformal focus that does not reflect the realities faced by\r\nthe Security Council and, therefore, does not facilitate\r\nan effective dialogue between those United Nations\r\nbodies.\r\nIt is fair to recognize that the General Assembly\r\nhas some responsibility in this matter, as it has not\r\nbeen able to implement existing agreements that relate\r\nto the report of the Security Council. As we are aware,\r\nin undertaking efforts to improve the working methods\r\nof the General Assembly, that body adopted several\r\nresolutions, including resolution 51/241, entitled\r\n“Strengthening the United Nations system”, in which\r\nvarious tasks are assigned to the Assembly, among\r\nthem, the assessment that must be made by the\r\nPresident of the Assembly of the debate of the report of\r\nthe Council. However, the necessary political decision\r\nhas not been taken to do that.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report, the\r\nworld experienced in horror the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember. It is necessary to highlight today more than\r\never the Council’s speed and effectiveness in\r\nresponding to those terrible events.\r\nIn adopting its resolution 1373 (2001), by which\r\nit established the Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\nchaired by Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, and in\r\ncreating the Committee established pursuant to Council\r\nresolution 1267 (1999), chaired by Ambassador\r\nAlfonso Valdivieso, the Council took decisions of\r\nindisputable lasting value. Equally, Security Council\r\nresolution 1438 (2002), adopted last night, on the\r\nhorrible attack that took place in Bali also demonstrates\r\nthis. In these times, when ominous forecasts are being\r\nmade from this very rostrum concerning the future of\r\nour Organization, it is important to remember these\r\nfacts.\r\nDuring the period under evaluation, we note once\r\nagain that cooperation between the Security Council\r\nand other United Nations bodies responsible for vital\r\nareas such as poverty reduction, development\r\nassistance, human rights and the environment, is\r\ncrucial to tackle the root causes of the threat of\r\nterrorism.\r\nGlobalization is a source of wealth and of\r\nsurprising, and often marvellous, revolutions in the\r\nfields of technology and communications; but it is still\r\nnot clear to anyone whether globalization will include\r\nmore people than it marginalizes. On the contrary, it is\r\nevident that the ungovernable process of globalization\r\noriginating in wealthy countries is unleashing a wave\r\nof globalized destitution, fuelling alienation and\r\nradicalization.\r\nNew threats and challenges to international peace\r\nand security are emerging on a near-daily basis and\r\nconstantly changing at vertiginous speed. The\r\ncredibility of the United Nations in the new millennium\r\ndoes not depend on its will to launch an order based on\r\nforce, but rather on its development of an integrated\r\nvision that would make it possible to deal decisively\r\nwith marginalization, oppression and extreme poverty,\r\nto develop international law and firmly to maintain\r\npeace and security wherever terrorism attempts to\r\nimpose itself.\r\nTo achieve this, it is necessary to decisively\r\nexplore the Secretary-General’s proposals for our\r\nOrganization’s path to reform. Furthermore, we think\r\nthat reality will sooner or later oblige us to reassess the\r\nneed to intensify action leading to Security Council\r\nreform in all its aspects.\r\nIt is my country’s opinion that the Security\r\nCouncil should not and cannot continue to reflect the\r\nrealities of the Second World War; it should reflect the\r\nnew regional trends that today characterize the\r\ninternational system. The path to be followed should be\r\nbased on the selfless search of the common good,\r\nkeeping as the main guideline an increase not only of\r\nthe Security Council’s efficiency but also of its\r\nrepresentativity and legitimacy, so that it may become a\r\nmore democratic body, in accordance with the\r\naspirations and the reality of today’s international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe appreciate the attention paid by the Security\r\nCouncil to the situation in the Middle East, including\r\nthe question of Palestine, the gravity of which leaves\r\nno room for indifference. But it does not seem possible\r\nto ignore the fact that the threat of the use of the veto\r\nin this matter has frequently paralysed the Council,\r\noften stripping its decisions of effectiveness. Who is\r\nnot aware that the tragedy of Palestine and Israel is one\r\nof the issues — if not the central issue — in present\r\nday international relations? Who can fail to recognize\r\nthat the international community has decided to\r\nintervene, and has in fact intervened, in situations with\r\nlesser dimensions and whose threat to international\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\npeace and security is much more remote? How much\r\nmore deterioration in the appalling living conditions of\r\nthe decimated Palestinian people — and how many\r\nmore murders due to terrorism in Israel — can\r\nmankind tolerate? As the Secretary-General has\r\nsuggested, the international community should\r\nintervene in this conflict, creating the conditions in\r\nwhich the parties involved can resume negotiations\r\nleading to lasting peace.\r\nThe situation in Iraq is a special challenge for the\r\nSecurity Council. The Council should adopt united\r\ndecisions, reflecting the results of discussions that are\r\ntransparent and open to all its members. Iraq, for its\r\npart, should fully meet, without any conditions or any\r\nprocrastination, the obligations incumbent upon it\r\nunder Security Council resolutions. Otherwise, the\r\nCouncil should adopt the measures necessary for the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions. We welcome the\r\ndecision to hold an open Security Council debate on\r\nthis matter tomorrow.\r\nWe have followed with interest and satisfaction\r\nthe results of the Security Council’s missions to the\r\nAfrican continent and the progress made in\r\nunderstanding the deep-rooted causes of conflict in the\r\nregion. In this respect, my delegation expresses its\r\ngratitude to the Chairman of the sanctions Committee\r\non Sierra Leone, Ambassador Adolfo Aguilar Zinser of\r\nMexico, for his report to the Council on his visit to the\r\nMano River Union States in June and July 2002. We\r\nalso express satisfaction at the results achieved by the\r\nMonitoring Mechanism on Sanctions against UNITA,\r\nchaired by Ambassador Juan Larrain.\r\nWe recognize and appreciate the assistance and\r\nongoing guidance given by the Council to the people of\r\nTimor-Leste, who achieved their independence on 20\r\nMay 2002, following a complex process that was at\r\ntimes characterized by difficulties.\r\nIn relation to peacekeeping operations, we feel\r\nthat the holding of joint meetings between the Security\r\nCouncil Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations\r\nand troop-contributing countries is an excellent\r\nmechanism to include the nations involved in each case\r\nin the decision-making process. We support the fine-\r\ntuning of that mechanism, to develop its potential to\r\nthe full, so that troop-contributing countries may\r\neffectively participate in taking the decisions that affect\r\nthem.\r\nFinally, we cannot fail to recognize the dedication\r\nof the Council to issues such as the prevention of\r\narmed conflict, small arms, children in armed conflict,\r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict and women\r\nand peace, among other important topics.\r\nChile welcomes the fact that countries continue to\r\ncome to the United Nations to solve their conflicts.\r\nCollective international security resides in the\r\ncommitment of Member States to multilateral\r\ncooperation. But the preservation of this commitment\r\nrequires an urgent adaptation of the norms that guide\r\nthe action of the Security Council. We know that, due\r\nto the nature of the objective and the diversity of both\r\nviews and interests, this will not be an easy exercise. It\r\nwill be difficult. But that does not mean that it will be\r\nimpossible.\r\nThe Organization can rely on the enthusiastic\r\nsupport of my country in everything required for\r\nachieving this goal.\r\nMr. Vento (Italy): First of all, I would like to\r\noffer the condolences of the Government of Italy to the\r\nIndonesian authorities for the grave terrorist attack that\r\ntook place in Bali; our condolences go also to all the\r\nother countries that suffered loss of life in that tragic\r\nevent.\r\nI congratulate the President of the General\r\nAssembly on his decision to combine the debates on\r\nthe annual report of the Security Council and on reform\r\nof the Security Council. This is a significant innovation\r\nthat moves in the direction of streamlining the work of\r\nthe General Assembly, as Italy and its European Union\r\npartners have actively urged.\r\nItaly feels that we must make it our common\r\npriority to carry forward the reform of the United\r\nNations, so as to strengthen its ability to act and to\r\nguarantee international security in a framework of\r\nstability and peace.\r\nThe past 12 months have been a particularly\r\nintense and challenging period for the Security\r\nCouncil. The fight against terror, peace operations,\r\nnation-building and political support for mediation\r\nefforts in several regional crises: the members of the\r\nSecurity Council exercised their various\r\nresponsibilities on various fronts simultaneously, as\r\nrelated in the new documents submitted to us pursuant\r\nto Article 15 of the Charter. I wish to acknowledge the\r\nchanges introduced to the content and the format of the\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nannual report and to commend the active contribution\r\nof several non-permanent members to that result. Italy\r\nalso extends its congratulations to the Chairman of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, Sir Jeremy Greenstock,\r\non his determined and capable leadership of that\r\ncrucial Committee.\r\nIn the past year, the members of the Security\r\nCouncil have dedicated more attention to improving\r\nthe transparency and openness of its working methods.\r\nThat is commendable. The Council’s wrap-up sessions\r\nhave further proved a useful opportunity to assess the\r\nmonthly work and to consider how its substance and\r\nprocedural aspects can be improved. For those who,\r\nfrom outside the Council, make a responsible\r\ncontribution, under Council mandate, to the\r\nmaintenance of peace in various troubled regions of the\r\nworld, from the Balkans to Afghanistan, from Africa to\r\nthe Middle East, it is important to be able to concur\r\nwith Security Council decisions. Allowing us to\r\nparticipate more frequently in the Council’s\r\nproceedings will, to some extent, enable us to express\r\nour views on issues of direct interest to the\r\ninternational community. Further progress along those\r\nlines is therefore recommended.\r\nTransparency continues to be a means by which\r\nnon-Council members can influence the Council’s\r\ndecisions. It is not, nor can it be, an end in itself. That\r\nis why there should be continued progress in the\r\ninteraction between members and non-members whose\r\ninterests are especially affected, as described in Article\r\n31 of the Charter. At the same time, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral recommends in his report “Strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387), we encourage the Security Council to\r\nconsider codifying the recent changes in its practice.\r\nWe are aware that in some cases the political\r\nsensitivity of the issues addressed requires that the\r\ndiscussions enjoy a degree of confidentiality and\r\nflexibility. But when the Council’s decision-making\r\nprocess becomes too opaque, its decisions lose\r\nauthority and lend themselves to contradictory\r\ninterpretations that weaken their implementation. We\r\nshould all renew the call for full compliance with\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and other obligations\r\nunder international law.\r\nIt is true that the search for consensus —\r\ngathering the broadest possible support for a specific\r\nline of action — may seem a laborious and time-\r\nconsuming process. But when our collective security is\r\nat stake, it is necessary to develop an informed,\r\ncommon assessment that will allow responsibility-\r\nsharing at the international level. Ultimately, what we\r\nmust all avoid is creating the impression of United\r\nNations inaction, especially when a serious threat is\r\nimminent and certified. Equal care must be paid not to\r\ncreate the impression of selective or partial approaches,\r\nfor example, when consensus is held hostage during\r\nclosed consultations or when the Council is prevented\r\nfrom addressing a serious threat to the maintenance of\r\npeace. Making the Security Council vulnerable to\r\naccusations of double standards would erode its\r\ncredibility and weaken its decisions. On that\r\nfundamental aspect, the Secretary-General’s opening\r\nstatement to the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly mentioned some priority issues that will test\r\nthe authority of the Security Council in the weeks and\r\nmonths to come.\r\nWhen faced by the vicious threat of international\r\nterrorism, the Security Council proved that it was able\r\nto act promptly and decisively in a collegial manner. To\r\npromote global governance, the Council needs true\r\nleadership based on collective vision and shared\r\ninterests and values.\r\nThat is why, in the context of the current debates\r\non Security Council reform, Italy believes that the\r\nissues of representation and effectiveness should be\r\ndealt with in tandem. One cannot imagine changing the\r\nsize or composition of the Security Council without, at\r\nthe same time, carefully considering the consequences\r\nof any expansion formula. Those who call for an\r\nincrease in permanent members should offer\r\nconvincing reasons on at least two points: first, the\r\npolitical, geopolitical or global — and not merely\r\nfinancial — entitlement and authority for obtaining that\r\nprivilege; and secondly, the impact of such expansion\r\non the decision-making process in terms of efficiency\r\nand transparency. Indeed, new permanent members\r\nwould only add to the Council’s present shortcomings.\r\nItaly is committed to efforts to strengthen the\r\nSecurity Council. Last year we formulated some\r\nproposals on areas where, in our opinion, the Council\r\nshould step in. We are pleased to note that those issues\r\nwere addressed and, at least in part, brought closer to a\r\nsolution. This year we would like to focus on two\r\nparticular questions.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nThe first is the relationship between the Security\r\nCouncil and regional organizations. Regional\r\norganizations make a decisive contribution to the\r\nimplementation of Council resolutions. For example,\r\nCouncil activities in the fields of sanctions, the fight\r\nagainst terrorism and the conduct of complex peace\r\noperations, such as those in the Balkans — where a\r\ngood example of an exit strategy will be set when the\r\nEuropean Union takes over the United Nations Mission\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina on 1 January 2003 — are\r\ngreatly enhanced by its cooperation with regional\r\norganizations. One need only think of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee outreach, or the 1267 (1999)\r\nSanctions Committee. We must recognize that some\r\nregional organizations have developed their crisis-\r\nmanagement capabilities to such a level that they can\r\ncontribute to the decision-shaping process of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Council should therefore avail\r\nitself more frequently of the views of those regional\r\norganizations, since they are often equipped with\r\nsignificant political and financial resources and are\r\nbetter able to mobilize the will of the main regional\r\nplayers.\r\nTo that end, Italy actively promotes the identity\r\nof the European Union in the Security Council’s work.\r\nWe feel encouraged by the progress achieved thus far\r\nand by the awareness of the large and obvious potential\r\nfor a greater cohesive contribution of the European\r\nUnion in the fields of security and peace.\r\nA second issue is related to peace-building and\r\ntransition to a lasting consolidation of peace. In the\r\npast year, the Security Council has not launched any\r\nnew peace operations. Yet, at the same time, it has\r\nrestructured and adjusted the mandates of United\r\nNations peacekeeping or peace-building missions in\r\nAfghanistan, East Timor and Angola and has started to\r\nreshape the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone.\r\nWe encourage the members of the Security Council to\r\ndraft coherent and integrated strategies to support the\r\ntransition to durable peace and stability. Those\r\nstrategies should be based on the establishment of\r\ndemocratic institutions, the promotion of human rights\r\nand the rule of law, in close consultation with the\r\nlargest donors and the specialized agencies, funds and\r\nprogrammes.\r\nI conclude with a question. With the debates on\r\nSecurity Council reform entering the tenth year, how\r\ncan we move forward? I would like to recall that annex\r\nVI to last year’s report (A/56/47) contains a realistic\r\nproposal submitted by Italy and supported by many\r\ncountries during the debates in the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group. Italy believes that our proposal would\r\nmake a very useful basis for building general\r\nagreement on comprehensive and meaningful Security\r\nCouncil reform called for by the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nMs. Pulido Santana (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We join previous speakers in condemning the\r\nterrorist acts perpetrated recently in Indonesia, and we\r\noffer our condolences to the families of the victims.\r\nIt is a source of particular satisfaction for the\r\ndelegation of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to\r\nparticipate in today’s debate on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, as the positive changes that we have\r\nobserved in the functioning of that important body, as\r\nreflected in the report, confirms our confidence in our\r\nmembership of this Organization. At the same time, we\r\nfeel encouraged by the willingness of the members of\r\nthe Security Council to address some of the\r\nsuggestions of Member States of the United Nations\r\nwith regard to the report.\r\nIt would only be right on this occasion to\r\nacknowledge the work done by those involved in this\r\ncomplex exercise. We would like in particular to\r\ncommend the work of the Ambassador of Singapore,\r\nKishore Mahbubani, and his entire team, for their\r\nprofessionalism and sense of commitment to the United\r\nNations in taking on the task of presenting the report of\r\nthe Security Council in a new format.\r\nLike previous speakers, we would like to refer to\r\nsome specific aspects. First, the application of a new\r\nmethodology in preparation of the report to include an\r\nintroduction that effectively addresses our demands for\r\nan analytical approach and a multi-part format divided\r\ninto a number of chapters, is very positive. Such a\r\nlayout makes it easier to gain an overview, while\r\navoiding the duplication of documents that have\r\nalready been published and are known to delegations,\r\nthus preventing waste in terms of resources, time and\r\nenergy.\r\nThe schematic framework around which most of\r\nthe report is built could prove useful if it is developed\r\nfurther — not so as to return to past methodology, but\r\nrather to form the basis of for an analytical assessment.\r\nThe valuable exercise undertaken in the\r\nintroductory part of the report is certainly a useful\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nguide to that end. This approach could be extended to\r\nthe entire document, but it would be particularly\r\nrelevant for the second part, in which the issues\r\nexamined by the Council are presented in the context\r\nof its responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nApplying geographical and thematic criteria, as\r\nseems to be the case in the second, third and fourth\r\nparts of the report, would enable those parts to be\r\ndeveloped analytically. Part II could be drawn up\r\nfollowing the model of the introduction, with each\r\nsubject being considered on the basis of certain\r\nparameters — for example, what did the Council do\r\nwith respect to each of those items? What progress did\r\nit make? What implications does that have for\r\ninternational peace and security, or for the immediate\r\nand future prospects for each of those themes?\r\nFollowing on from that, sections I through IV of\r\npart I could be kept, since they constitute a useful\r\nquick reference document, while the rest of the first\r\npart — those paragraphs that refer to meetings of the\r\nCouncil — could be subsumed into the second part,\r\nwhich would be developed in the way that I suggested\r\nearlier, on the basis of thematic, geographic criteria,\r\nrather than under the heading of “Meetings”.\r\nWe believe that such a formula would be much\r\nmore beneficial in making evaluations, providing\r\ninformation and presenting results. My delegation is\r\nconvinced that if such changes were made, it would\r\nresult in the production of reports that were more\r\nsubstantive than the summary form of this year’s\r\ndocument, but not as lengthy as those that were\r\nsubmitted up to this year.\r\nSuch a methodology would allow, for example,\r\nfor the further development of matters of great\r\nimportance for the Security Council and the entire\r\nUnited Nations and its membership, such as the fight\r\nagainst terrorism. In that way, the analysis of that\r\ntheme in the introduction could be further expanded,\r\nincluding it as an important aspect of the corresponding\r\nanalytical section. Thus we would avoid relegating the\r\nissue to a mere chronological listing under the\r\nmeetings of the Committee established pursuant to\r\nresolution 1373 (2001) — in section VIII of part I and\r\nChapter 17 of part II, under the heading “Threats to\r\ninternational peace and security caused by terrorist\r\nacts”.\r\nIt would be very useful to have an evaluation of\r\nthe work of that Committee, given that there is an\r\nexcellent basis for it in the valuable exchange of\r\ninformation process that the Chairman of the\r\nCommittee, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock,\r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom, has\r\nestablished with non-members of the Council. It would\r\nalso be useful to have interactive public meetings of\r\nthe Security Council in which the work of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee could be evaluated with a view to\r\nfurthering and improving its work.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the reference to the wrap-\r\nup meetings on the work of the Council. Our delegation\r\ngreatly appreciates these meetings because the analysis\r\nalready carried out by the members of the Security\r\nCouncil provides non-members with the information\r\nnecessary to articulate a joint vision, to analyse the\r\nactivities of the Council and to duly inform their\r\nGovernments in an effective manner.\r\nAlthough we value the reference to the wrap-up\r\nmeetings and to the fact that the Council is continuing\r\nwith that practice, we would also appreciate the\r\ninclusion in future reports of a summary of such\r\nevaluations, since by its very nature it would help to\r\nestablish the analytical approach to which we all\r\naspire.\r\nWe note with appreciation the fact that documents\r\nhave been distributed in this respect by some members\r\nof the Security Council, in keeping with the\r\nresponsibility of the presidency at the end of each\r\nmonth, when there has been a wrap-up meeting to\r\nanalyse the work of that body. We regret that there are\r\nno verbatim records of such meetings.\r\nWe welcome the fact that during the work of the\r\nSecurity Council, as outlined in the report, certain\r\nthematic items were highlighted that are of particular\r\nimportance to our delegation. These include themes\r\nsuch as women and peace and security; children and\r\narmed conflict; the protection of civilians in armed\r\nconflict; and small arms. We also note that matters\r\nrelating to Africa take up a large part of the Council’s\r\nagenda, indicating the interest of that body in such\r\nmatters in the context of the new prospects that have\r\nopened up for that continent.\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela commends the\r\nCouncil for its attempt to coordinate its work with that\r\nof the Economic and Social Council, and hopes that it\r\nwill continue to focus its efforts on these matters in\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\norder to meet its objective of finding solutions to\r\nenable it to better fulfil its primary obligation for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nOur delegation recognizes that the challenge\r\npresented to the Security Council by the Members of\r\nthe Organization is a huge and very sensitive one,\r\nbecause it is not easy to satisfy so many countries with\r\ndifferent views and interests and to offer an\r\ninterpretation of the facts that is acceptable to all.\r\nWe feel optimistic because, given the fact that we\r\nhave been able to make progress with this revised\r\nformat, we see no reason why this exercise could not\r\nbe continued.\r\nIn this respect, we consider that Ambassador\r\nMahbubani’s proposal that evaluation criteria be\r\ndeveloped for the work of the Council, and that a\r\nmethodology be used and research carried out that\r\nwould yield figures and statistical data, would give the\r\nCouncil useful tools for the analytical evaluation that\r\nwe would all like to see.\r\nI should like to refer briefly here to the question\r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council. It is interesting to\r\nbe able to comment on both agenda items together.\r\nUnfortunately, in this area we do not feel the\r\nsame optimism that we did with respect to the report of\r\nthe Security Council. We cannot fail to note that,\r\nregrettably, yet another year has elapsed without any\r\nsubstantial progress being made on the reform of this\r\nmain body, even though we recognize the significant\r\nchanges that have been achieved in various areas\r\nrelated to its working methods, the transparency of its\r\nfunctioning, an increase in the number of public\r\nmeetings and periodic wrap-up sessions, and the\r\ninstitution of a more equitable way of drawing up the\r\nlist of speakers in public debates.\r\nThese changes, even though they are good in and\r\nof themselves, do not address the main issue of the\r\nreform of the Council. A comprehensive overall\r\nperspective has not been achieved that would serve as a\r\nbasis for the necessary changes, such as those relating\r\nto the composition of and an increase in the\r\nmembership, the issue of the veto and working\r\nmethods.\r\nIn particular, we reaffirm once again that it is not\r\npossible to dissociate the increase in the number of\r\nmembers from the question of the veto. The privilege\r\nof the veto, which we have consistently rejected since\r\nthe very drafting of the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nmust be eliminated, or, at the very least, its use should\r\nbe regulated in accordance with the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of the States Members of the\r\nOrganization. That is why, in the reform of the\r\nCouncil, we cannot shy away from this question if we\r\nwish to transform this organ into a democratic,\r\nequitable and transparent one.\r\nAfter almost a decade of study, examination and\r\nconsideration within the high-level Working Group\r\nchaired by the President of the General Assembly, and\r\ndespite the fact that many efforts have been made to\r\nachieve the objective for which it was established,\r\nVenezuela feels that this process has taken on some\r\nurgency. This is particularly true in the present\r\nsituation, as all Member States face the pressing need\r\nto give fresh impetus to the United Nations, revitalize\r\nthe General Assembly and strengthen the Organization,\r\nnow that the Secretary-General has presented his report\r\non this matter.\r\nEven though the Security Council is very\r\nimportant, it is still one of the organs of the United\r\nNations and so cannot excluded from the general\r\nreform process, nor can it remain on the sidelines of\r\nthe major changes that must be made to adapt to the\r\ninternational system and to the realities of our times.\r\nWe hope that the spirit of reform that has begun\r\nto emerge in the Security Council will promote the\r\nimplementation of the necessary changes, as referred to\r\nin the report, and will also have an influence on, and\r\npromote a general agreement among, the Member\r\nStates with a view to achieving the elimination of the\r\nveto and increasing the number of Council members.\r\nThe openness shown by the members of the Council in\r\nconnection with the report demonstrates that change is\r\npossible, and that is why we continue to trust in the\r\nfact that the Security Council can be steered in the\r\ndirection of the changes required to ensure good\r\ngovernance in the Organization.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): Allow me to begin\r\nby expressing our heartfelt condolences to the people\r\nand the Government of Indonesia and to the families of\r\nthe victims from all over the world, including many\r\nfrom South Africa, for the devastating tragedy that\r\ntook place in Bali, Indonesia.\r\nThis terrorist attack reminds us of the urgent\r\nchallenges the international community must now\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nconfront. The people whose car bomb killed nearly 200\r\ninnocent civilians in Bali are outlaws who do not\r\nrespect the norms and laws of civilized society. They\r\nmistakenly believe that they can achieve their\r\nobjectives through chaos and bloodshed. Our response\r\nas the international community must demonstrate that\r\nwe are united in our resolve to fight terror and that we\r\nremain ready and willing to respond collectively and\r\nmultilaterally.\r\nAs stated by the Secretary-General in his report\r\non the strengthening of the United Nations,\r\n“the need for a strong multilateral institution —\r\none dedicated to the service of humanity as a\r\nwhole — has never been more acutely felt than it\r\nis today, in the era of globalization”. (A/57/387,\r\nchapter I, para. 2)\r\nWe have before us two reports — one from the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group on Security Council\r\nreform and the other from the Security Council,\r\nreporting on its work for the year 2001-2002.\r\nIt is now nine years since Member States began\r\nthe debate on the reform of the Security Council. South\r\nAfrica has held a consistent and clear position, in line\r\nwith that of the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nOrganization of African Unity/African Union, that the\r\nmembership of the Security Council should be\r\nexpanded to correct the imbalances in its composition.\r\nIt is our view that expansion should occur in both the\r\npermanent and non-permanent categories.\r\nFurthermore, we believe that new permanent\r\nmembers of an expanded Security Council should have\r\nthe same rights as do current permanent members. We\r\ncall for the curtailment and eventual elimination of the\r\nveto. The fact that we have not made progress on these\r\ncritical issues in the Open-ended Working Group over\r\nthe course of nine years of deliberations has not\r\ndeterred us in any way. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral when he states in his report on the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations that:\r\n“In the eyes of much of the world, the size\r\nand composition of the Security Council appear\r\ninsufficiently representative. The perceived\r\nshortcomings in the Council’s credibility\r\ncontribute to a slow but steady erosion of its\r\nauthority, which in turn has grave implications for\r\ninternational peace and security.” (ibid., para. 20)\r\nThe words of the Secretary-General should\r\nencourage us to intensify our efforts to reform the\r\nSecurity Council. We cannot give up at this point.\r\nWe welcome the improvement in the format of\r\nthe report on the work of the Security Council. Its\r\ncontents reaffirm that the preceding year has been one\r\nof the busiest in the Council’s history. Although the\r\nreport has fewer pages than in previous years, it can\r\nbenefit from further review by the Members. Member\r\nStates would have appreciated an overall assessment of\r\nthe work that is brought before the Council and of how\r\nCouncil members arrived at some of their most difficult\r\ndecisions. For example, the Security Council narrative\r\non “The situation in the Middle East, including the\r\nPalestinian Question” does not explain the reasoning\r\nbehind some decisions taken on this important issue.\r\nMy delegation, acting in our capacity as Chair of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, submitted two letters to\r\nthe Security Council addressing the situation in\r\nPalestine. In March 2002, we requested the Security\r\nCouncil to consider inviting Prime Minister Ariel\r\nSharon of Israel and President Yasser Arafat of\r\nPalestine to come to New York to discuss the situation\r\nin the Middle East with the Security Council. In April\r\n2002, we reminded the Council of the recommendation\r\nalready made by some of the NAM members that the\r\nSecurity Council visit Israel and Palestine at the\r\nearliest opportunity to familiarize itself with the\r\nsituation on the ground. In both cases, we were unable\r\nto convince the Council to act on these suggestions and\r\nwe have yet to understand why the Security Council\r\ndismissed these suggestions. Perhaps the report of the\r\nCouncil could have been used to throw more light on\r\nthe thinking of the Council on such complicated issues.\r\nWe also welcome the increased number of open\r\nmeetings, which provide greater opportunities for\r\nparticipation by non-members in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council. We particularly appreciate the\r\ncreativity shown by some Council Presidents who\r\ndeviated from the standard practice whereby the\r\nCouncil members usually speak first while the non-\r\nmembers listen. Some of the open meetings benefited\r\nfrom the Council’s first listening to the rest of the\r\nmembership before sharing its views. This allowed\r\nnon-members to contribute directly to the decision-\r\nmaking of the Council. Sometimes there has been\r\ninteractive dialogue in the Council, which has also\r\nbeen greatly appreciated.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nWe are particularly appreciative of the\r\ntransparency in the work carried out by Ambassador\r\nJeremy Greenstock in his capacity as Chair of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee. His regular briefings to\r\nMember States have allowed for an exchange of views\r\nbetween the Security Council and the rest of the\r\nmembership, which had never happened before. We\r\nhope that this will set the example for how the Security\r\nCouncil can engage the rest of the membership.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that the progress made\r\nin the working methods of the Council is directly\r\nlinked to the Working Group’s efforts to improve the\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. Indeed, the\r\nWorking Group’s success is reflected in the positive\r\nmanner in which the Security Council itself has\r\nconsidered and adopted measures to improve its\r\nworking methods. In the light of the positive changes\r\nthat the Security Council has undertaken in its\r\nprocedures, we support the call of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the Council to codify the recent changes in\r\nits own practice and to adopt standard and predictable,\r\nrather than provisional, rules of procedure. Fifty years\r\nare sufficient time for the Council to decide whether to\r\nmake its rules permanent or not. The world seeks not\r\nonly a representative Council, but a predictable one as\r\nwell.\r\nAnother interesting improvement by the Council\r\nhas been the willingness to cooperate with other\r\nbodies, such as the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nappreciate that and we believe this has inspired the\r\nCouncil’s efforts to diversify the requisite skills of\r\npeace missions to address gender, HIV/AIDS and the\r\nplight of children in conflict situations. It is a\r\nrecognition that the Security Council cannot work\r\nalone in ensuring the success of disarmament,\r\ndemobilization, rehabilitation and reintegration\r\nprogrammes. We therefore urge the Security Council to\r\ncontinue to forge closer working relations with other\r\nUnited Nations bodies and international agencies to\r\nimprove coordination and cooperation in dealing with\r\npost-conflict situations, as well as to avert the\r\nconditions that lead to insecurity and violent conflict.\r\nThe large number of conflict situations, many in\r\nAfrica, that the Security Council remains seized of\r\nreminds us that we have to make even greater strides in\r\nresolving the root causes of conflict. In pursuing its\r\nmandate of maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity, the Security Council must uphold the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nand ensure that multilateralism does not become a\r\nvehicle for the strong to prevail over the weak. In this\r\nregard, serious attention needs to be given to the\r\nSecurity Council’s sanctions regimes and, in particular,\r\nthe severe unintended consequences that sanctions have\r\non third States and vulnerable communities.\r\nThe Security Council, and indeed the United\r\nNations, cannot be party to increasing the humanitarian\r\nsuffering of civilians who are caught up in situations of\r\nconflict, nor can it be convinced to agree to decisions\r\nwhich will subject and condemn large numbers of\r\ninnocent civilians to conditions of war in efforts to\r\nenforce its resolutions. Through the United Nations\r\nCharter, we adopted a system of collective security and\r\nwe now have to act with resolve to protect our rules-\r\nbased system of international relations. The norms and\r\nfundamental principles of international law must be our\r\nbasis for establishing the conditions for peace, justice\r\nand human dignity.\r\nThe Security Council should represent our\r\ncollective security concerns and ultimately be\r\naccountable to the entire United Nations. The\r\nSecretary-General also notes in his report that\r\n“the perceived shortcomings in the Council’s\r\ncredibility contribute to a slow but steady erosion\r\nof its authority, which in turn has grave\r\nimplications for international peace and security”.\r\n(A/57/387, para. 20)\r\nThe Security Council’s role in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security is a core function of\r\nthe United Nations. The credibility and the respect that\r\nthe Security Council deserves will largely depend on\r\nwhether we, the Member States, ensure that it remains\r\nthe universal repository of our efforts in the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security.\r\nIt has always been a source of comfort for those\r\nof us who are non-members of the Security Council\r\nthat there are 10 elected members that we choose to\r\nrepresent our views. The elected members have their\r\nown special role to play in the Council’s deliberations.\r\nElected members may not always have the same\r\nresources or even global influence as permanent\r\nmembers do. However, they bring credibility and value\r\nto the Council by virtue of having been chosen by the\r\nmembers of General Assembly. They bring balance to\r\nthe decisions of the Council. We are therefore\r\ndismayed to learn that these elected members are often\r\nexcluded from participating in the consultations on the\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.29\r\nmost pressing issues before the Council. This is totally\r\nunacceptable and can only add to the erosion of the\r\nauthority and legitimacy of Security Council decisions.\r\nIn combining the two reports — one on the\r\nreform of the Security Council and another on the work\r\nof the Council — we have been exposed to the positive\r\nand encouraging achievements of the Council and the\r\nareas which still need attention. Suggestions have been\r\nmade that the two reports be separated and considered\r\nas different agenda items. The report on the work of the\r\nSecurity Council is mandated by the Charter. The\r\nreform of the Security Council is also inspired by the\r\ndesire to live up to the spirit of the Charter. Although\r\nthese are very different, we believe that, for this\r\nsession, the membership has benefited by considering\r\nboth reports at the same time.\r\nAs we have already stated, the deadlock we face\r\non the reform of the Security Council needs an urgent\r\nand new impetus. We call on Mr. Kavan, in his capacity\r\nas the Chairperson of the Open-ended Working Group\r\non Security Council reform, to consider taking the\r\ndebate to a higher political level. The Working Group\r\ncannot continue for a tenth year of business as usual.\r\nWe concur with the Secretary-General’s conclusion in\r\nhis report that\r\n“no reform of the United Nations would be\r\ncomplete without reform of the Security\r\nCouncil”. (ibid.)\r\nWe join in celebrating the successes that we have\r\nachieved as the United Nations, particularly through\r\nthe efforts of the Security Council, the latest of which\r\nhas been the admission of an independent and\r\nsovereign Timor-Leste to our family of nations. These\r\nsuccesses should inspire the Security Council to act on\r\nits responsibility to those peoples who still suffer under\r\noccupation and oppression in Palestine, Western Sahara\r\nand beyond. The peoples of those territories will\r\ncontinue to look to the Security Council for assistance\r\nto alleviate their plight and fulfil our Charter’s pledge.\r\nWe have to ensure that the Security Council does not\r\nfail them.\r\nOur combined efforts must therefore be to\r\nsupport multilateralism and collective security, and to\r\nwork towards a credible and more representative\r\nSecurity Council. International peace and security are\r\nprerequisites for sustainable development and for the\r\nfostering of friendly relations among all nations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
