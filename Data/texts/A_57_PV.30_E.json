(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Miss Clarke\r\n(Barbados), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda items 11 and 40 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/57/2 and\r\nA/57/2/Corr.1)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and\r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council\r\nand related matters: report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia): Let me begin by\r\njoining all those who have spoken before me in\r\ncondemning the recent terrorist attack in Bali,\r\nextending to the Government and people of Indonesia\r\nmy delegation’s condolences on the extensive loss they\r\nsuffered. That sad incident further underscores the\r\nurgency of the United Nations developing realistic\r\napproaches to combating terrorism throughout the\r\nworld. The Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee has made an impressive start. My\r\ndelegation urges that it continue to fine-tune its\r\nperspectives and actions on the war against terrorism.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the completeness with\r\nwhich the report of the Security Council has been\r\ndelivered. The achievements in the period under review\r\nhave been many and impressive — a testimony to the\r\nhard work, focus and determination on the part of all\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nMy delegation notes with much satisfaction the\r\nimpressive achievements registered in the Council’s\r\nefforts to put out the fires of war. Sierra Leone has\r\nfully resolved the conflict that engulfed its territory for\r\na whole decade and has successfully transformed the\r\nmain militia, the Revolutionary United Front, into a\r\npolitical party, which participated fully in the recently-\r\nheld multiparty parliamentary and presidential\r\nelections. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a\r\nsignificant breakthrough was achieved when Rwanda\r\nand Uganda entered into an agreement with the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to withdraw their\r\ntroops. Other protagonists in the conflict there have\r\nalso undertaken to do the same. In Angola, the União\r\nNacional para a Independência Total de Angola\r\n(UNITA), which waged a relentless war against the\r\nGovernment for several decades, has formally agreed\r\nto lay down its arms and to pursue its objectives\r\npolitically. In the Sudan, the Government and the\r\nSudan People’s Liberation Army have signed and are\r\nimplementing the Machacos Protocol, heralding a\r\nprocess that will hopefully lead to lasting and durable\r\npeace. The hand of the Council was clearly visible in\r\nall those successes.\r\nThere are still festering problems, which the\r\nCouncil must continue to address with ingenuity and\r\nimagination. Liberia — and to a lesser extent the wider\r\nMano River Union — is still simmering. The conflict\r\nin the southern Senegalese region of Cassamance has\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nraged unabated for two decades now. And, sadly, new\r\nfull-blown civil strife has very recently begun in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire.\r\nGuinea-Bissau which successfully concluded its\r\ndemocratic transition, is still not out of the woods,\r\nhaving failed to secure the resources necessary for it to\r\nbegin giving meaning to its democracy and building the\r\nrequisite economic props for security and stability to\r\ntake hold. Here, the Gambia, in its capacity as\r\nChairman of the Group of Friends of Guinea-Bissau,\r\nwould like to commend the Council’s Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup on Africa, under the able Chairmanship of\r\nAmbassador Koonjul of Mauritius, for its initiative in\r\nestablishing the necessary interface with the Economic\r\nand Social Council, as the situation prevailing in\r\nGuinea-Bissau so glaringly demands. We also\r\ncommend the initiatives of the Council in addressing a\r\nletter of support for Guinea-Bissau to the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions and to the African Development\r\nBank. We sincerely hope that the Council will follow\r\nup on those initiatives with a view to ensuring that\r\nGuinea-Bissau is invested with the capacities and\r\ncapabilities needed for it to stay clear of the looming\r\nthreat of conflict.\r\nIt is evident that the Council still has a full\r\nagenda on conflict management and resolution in West\r\nAfrica, which I am sure it will address assiduously in\r\nthe year to come.\r\nThe spiralling cycle of violence in the Middle\r\nEast, in the year under review, has caused havoc and\r\ndevastation in terms of loss of property and human life.\r\nSadly, the pleas made by the Council to the parties to\r\nthe conflict through the numerous resolutions that it\r\npassed have all fallen on deaf ears. That regrettable\r\nsituation only undermines the authority of the Security\r\nCouncil and puts its efficacy in serious question. The\r\nUnited Nations Charter enjoins us all to eschew war\r\nand to adhere to peaceful means of resolving conflicts\r\nbetween nations. It is the responsibility of the members\r\nof the Security Council to ensure that all nations of the\r\nworld — big or small, strong or weak — adhere to that\r\nsacred principle of the United Nations. Not to do so\r\nwould amount to the Council’s abdication of its\r\nresponsibility and its betrayal of the trust confided in\r\nit.\r\nAlthough the Council has endeavoured to involve\r\nnon-members more in its work, including by increasing\r\nthe frequency of its open meetings and periodic wrap-\r\nup sessions, there still remains much more to be\r\naccomplished in our bid to render it more transparent\r\nand more reflective of the realities of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. No progress has been made in our call for the\r\npermanent seats to be increased to ensure a more\r\nequitable distribution across geographic regions.\r\nEqually, no headway has been made in efforts to\r\nreform the veto.\r\nThe situation remains unacceptable to my\r\ndelegation. My Government stands by the 1997 Harare\r\nDeclaration of the Assembly of heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Organization of African Unity on\r\nthe reform of the Council, which, inter alia, calls for\r\nthe composition of the Council to be democratized and\r\nfor its membership to be expanded to 26, with Africa\r\nbeing allocated two permanent seats and five non-\r\npermanent seats. Evidently, other regional groupings\r\nhave their own opinions on how the Council could be\r\nrendered more democratic and more representative of\r\nthe new mosaic of the membership of the United\r\nNations in the twenty-first century.\r\nMy delegation would like to see the Working\r\nGroup on the restructuring of the Council conclude its\r\nbusiness with the minimum delay so that its report and\r\nrecommendations could be submitted to the General\r\nAssembly for appropriate action.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to stress the need for\r\nthe Security Council to show more transparency in the\r\nway it handles the question of sanctions, as well as the\r\ndrawing up and management of travel ban lists.\r\nIndividuals being singled out for sanction, as well as\r\ntheir Governments, must be informed of the reasons for\r\nthe decision and be afforded an opportunity to defend\r\nthemselves. That is the only just and democratic way to\r\nhandle the matter. The current practice may only lead\r\nto the implementation of the sanctions becoming\r\nineffective, as Governments which may feel genuinely\r\naggrieved and yet can find no redress begin deciding\r\nnot to comply.\r\nI do sincerely hope that those issues will be given\r\nthe Council’s most serious attention. And as I wish the\r\nentire membership of the Council the very best in the\r\ncoming year, let me seize this opportunity to commend\r\nthe outgoing elected members — Colombia, Ireland,\r\nMauritius, Norway and Singapore — for their\r\nstewardship during their term of office and to\r\ncongratulate the new members — Angola, Chile,\r\nGermany, Pakistan and Spain — on their election.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nLike representatives who have preceded me in taking\r\nthe floor, I should like to express to the delegation of\r\nIndonesia our most sincere sympathy concerning the\r\nevents that took place in Bali a few days ago.\r\nToday, we are debating two items on our agenda,\r\nbut I shall focus my comments on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. There are two reasons for that. First,\r\nI would have very little to add to what I said in this\r\nHall exactly one year ago on the imperative of moving\r\nforward with Council reform, and we would not gain\r\nmuch by reiterating, year after year, positions that we\r\nall know. Secondly — and here I would differ with\r\nsome representatives who have spoken before me — I\r\nwould have preferred to keep both agenda items\r\nseparate. Although there is an obvious link between\r\nthem, I think the report that the Council submits to us\r\nis sufficiently important to merit separate\r\nconsideration. Needless to say, the report is one of the\r\nprincipal links between the General Assembly and the\r\nCouncil.\r\nIndeed, as we all know, Article l5 of the Charter\r\nprovides that the General Assembly “shall receive and\r\nconsider annual and special reports from the Security\r\nCouncil”. That assumes something more than a\r\nsymbolic or ceremonial act; rather, it constitutes one of\r\nthe branches of communication between the organs\r\nand, above all, a tool that enables the Assembly to play\r\nits role as the principal organ for deliberating, for\r\nadopting policies and for representing the United\r\nNations.\r\nMembers may recall that the report we received\r\nlast year did not even minimally fulfil the explicit\r\nintent of the Article I have cited. For that reason, we\r\npointed out then that the report was too descriptive,\r\nexcessively lengthy and totally devoid of those\r\nelements that would have enabled Members that do not\r\nhave the privilege of belonging to the Security Council\r\nto evaluate its work. That, in fact, tended to undervalue\r\nthe General Assembly itself.\r\nThe report that we have received this year\r\n(A/57/2) represents a step in the right direction to\r\ncorrect the situation I have just described. It is an\r\nimprovement in respect of its length, because it is\r\nmuch shorter, and content, because it is more\r\nanalytical. Although it does not fully meet our\r\nexpectations, at least it fulfils the task of keeping the\r\nGeneral Assembly duly informed on the Council’s\r\ncopious work programme during the period under\r\nreview.\r\nThat programme reveals important advances that\r\nare also achievements of the United Nations.\r\nNoteworthy among them are the developments in\r\nevents with regard to Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone,\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, Angola, the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo and the Great Lakes region. The same can\r\nbe said about Afghanistan and the operations carried\r\nout in the Balkans with the participation of the United\r\nNations. And, although one cannot speak of progress in\r\nthe Middle East — rather, the contrary is certainly the\r\ncase — at least the Security Council’s deliberations\r\nhave contributed to keeping that matter on the priority\r\nagenda and to giving the United Nations an opportunity\r\nto participate in the work of the Quartet to find ways\r\nout of the situation.\r\nOne should also recognize that the work of the\r\nCouncil itself has made some gains with regard to\r\ntransparency, thanks to various factors. Among them,\r\nwe should like to recall the contribution of Ambassador\r\nSir Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom, in his\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Security Council\r\nCommittee established pursuant to resolution 1373\r\n(2001). Perhaps because that resolution’s provisions\r\nare binding on all Member States, but also because of\r\nAmbassador Greenstock’s ability, his programme of\r\noutreach to delegations that do not belong to the\r\nCouncil deserves to be commended and imitated in\r\nsimilar cases. Not only has it been possible to inform\r\nall Members of Council activities on a matter of special\r\nrelevance, but the Council has also heard their\r\nsuggestions, observations and concerns.\r\nIn addition, the perception has been further\r\ninstitutionalized that Council members — particularly\r\nthose that are elected — represent Member States as a\r\nwhole. In that connection, my delegation is grateful to\r\nthe delegations of Jamaica, Colombia and Mexico for\r\nhaving kept all the members of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States informed of Council\r\nactivities.\r\nThe growing practice of holding public meetings\r\nhas also contributed to the closer involvement of all\r\nStates in the Council’s work, at least by providing them\r\nthe opportunity to express their views on subjects that\r\nthe Council considers relevant, despite the fact that\r\nthere is room for doubt as to whether external points of\r\nview have an appreciable influence on the decisions\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nultimately adopted. Finally, the perception also exists\r\nthat even the permanent members have been more\r\nsensitive than before to criticism concerning the closed\r\nnature of the Council’s work. The frequent statements\r\nof Presidents whose countries belong to that group\r\nattest to such sensitivity.\r\nDespite all that, one cannot fail to recognize that\r\nthe relationship between the organs of the United\r\nNations — especially that between the Security\r\nCouncil and the General Assembly — leaves much to\r\nbe desired. It could be argued that the concentration of\r\ndecision-making power on the highest-profile questions\r\nin this forum of 15 countries — dominated by the five\r\npermanent members, as everyone knows — has, up to\r\nnow, been at the expense of the Assembly’s authority.\r\nThat does not have to be the case, since the Charter\r\nprovides that the organs — each with its own particular\r\ncomposition and its own specialized area of\r\ncompetence — mutually support one another. But\r\nexperience has shown us — and we have repeatedly\r\nlamented the fact in this Hall — that, as the Council\r\ngains ascendancy, the Assembly loses it.\r\nThat being so, the report of the Security Council\r\nimplicitly reminds us of two crucial tasks that remain\r\nunaccomplished. I am referring, of course, to the\r\nongoing reform of the working methods of the General\r\nAssembly and to the long-delayed reform of the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council — namely, the\r\nsecond agenda item we are dealing with today, one\r\nthat, as I said, I will not touch upon at this time, since\r\nour views thereon have been put forward repeatedly.\r\nOne could, to be sure, speak at somewhat greater\r\nlength on the agenda concerning reform and also\r\ncomment on the United Nations system of governance,\r\nwhich no doubt is in need of modernization. It is\r\nregrettable that this part of the equation is virtually\r\nabsent from the proposal just made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral regarding further reform of the United\r\nNations, a proposal we shall be considering next week.\r\nIn short, the unsatisfactory existing relationship\r\nbetween the General Assembly, the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and the Security Council is a challenge\r\nthat, sooner or later, we shall have to take up seriously.\r\nIn conclusion, it is hoped that, pending the reform\r\nof our principal organs, we will at least be able to\r\nstrengthen the few links that already do exist between\r\nthem. In this connection, one can affirm that the timid\r\nfirst steps taken last year in response to that challenge\r\npoint in the right direction, as already stated, and that\r\nthe report before us now is undoubtedly to be regarded\r\nas a small step forward.\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First\r\nof all, I would like to extend Tunisia’s condolences to\r\nour sister country, Indonesia, and to the victims of the\r\nterrorist act in Bali, an act we vigorously condemn.\r\nOur sympathies also go out to the families of all of the\r\nvictims.\r\nMadam President, allow me now to join previous\r\nspeakers in thanking this month’s President of the\r\nSecurity Council for presenting the Council’s report to\r\nthe General Assembly in its new format. I would also\r\nlike to recognize the Ambassador of Singapore,\r\noriginator of this new format, for the commendable\r\nefforts that he and his team made to improve the\r\nCouncil’s report. In this regard, we are glad that the\r\nunnecessary lengthiness of the report has been reduced.\r\nThis has the double advantage of facilitating its reading\r\nand cutting the costs of its production.\r\nAs for the content of the report, we greet with\r\ngreat satisfaction the most prominent improvement,\r\nwhich is the implementation of an analytical approach\r\nin the introductory section. Clearly, we owe this\r\nimportant step to the delegation of the United\r\nKingdom, who authored this part of the report.\r\nNevertheless, the progress that has been made remains\r\nincomplete, and we call on the Security Council to\r\nextend the analytical approach throughout the entirety\r\nof the report so that all Member States can gain a clear\r\nidea of the conduct of the Council’s work and the\r\nrationale behind its decisions, and therefore be able to\r\nevaluate their pertinence and recommend appropriate\r\nadjustments where needed.\r\nWe call for these changes in order to increase the\r\ntransparency of the Security Council and thus improve\r\nits credibility. We should acknowledge the Council’s\r\nsustained efforts to improve its working methods in\r\nresponse to the concerns of Member States that have\r\nbeen expressed here, as well as within the framework\r\nof the Working Group on Security Council Reform.\r\nOver the course of the period covered in the\r\nreport, the Council held a record number of public\r\nmeetings. Furthermore, it stepped up its consultations\r\nwith the troop-contributing countries and reinforced its\r\noverture to civil society by organizing several Arria-\r\nformula meetings. Cooperation with regional and\r\nsubregional organizations was likewise reinforced.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nSanctions were further refined by fixing time\r\nlimits, taking into account their humanitarian\r\nconsequences and by establishing monitoring\r\nmechanisms to ensure their implementation. We regret,\r\nhowever, that the Council’s approach to these measures\r\nwas selective and tainted by political double standards,\r\nparticularly in the cases of Iraq and Libya.\r\nWe do find, however, that in its quest to improve\r\nits efficiency and transparency, the Council has gone so\r\nfar as to anticipate the expectations of Member States.\r\nLet me just mention, by way of example, the Council’s\r\nmissions to regions engaged in conflict, the wrap-up\r\nsessions at the end of each presidency, the joint\r\nsessions with the Assembly’s Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council Reform, the meetings to follow up the\r\nAssembly’s debate on the Council’s report and the\r\nexamination of the draft report by the Council members\r\nin a public forum.\r\nStill, we have much ground left to cover before\r\nwe achieve the necessary level of transparency and\r\nefficiency for a body that we have entrusted, through\r\nthe Charter, with the vital responsibility of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. This\r\nresponsibility should be assumed with faultless\r\ncredibility. The Council must base its authority on that\r\ncredibility. The view expressed unanimously from the\r\nbeginning of this session is that the current threats to\r\ninternational peace and security are so complex and so\r\nintense that they require the international community to\r\ndefine a real system of collective defence for diligently\r\nand effectively removing these threats. The Security\r\nCouncil has a primary responsibility and leading role to\r\nplay in this matter. For this, we believe it is imperative\r\nthat the Council act as follows.\r\nFirst, a true equilibrium should be established\r\namong its permanent members and its elected\r\nmembers. We believe that the elected members should\r\nbe associated as closely as, and on an equal footing\r\nwith, the permanent members in all the Council’s\r\ndeliberations on all questions on its agenda. The\r\nbehaviour we have observed over the last few weeks\r\nduring the deliberations on Iraq, where the 10 elected\r\nmembers are accorded second-class status, is\r\ncompletely unacceptable.\r\nSecondly, the Council should establish real\r\ninteraction with non-members and take their views into\r\naccount by concretely reflecting these views in its\r\ndecisions. Thirdly, the Council must accord the same\r\npriority to the issues on its agenda to ensure that the\r\nnational interests of Council members do not dominate\r\ndecisions emanating from the Council. Internal\r\npolitical considerations should not count when it comes\r\nto responding to a crucial problem that may involve the\r\nwhole world in a war or even in a threat of war.\r\nFourthly, it must harmonize and rationalize its policies\r\nrelating to sanctions and regulate how they conform to\r\nprecise criteria, taking into account humanitarian\r\nconsiderations and the provisions of Article 50 of the\r\nCharter. The sanctions must respond directly to the\r\nobjectives for which they were imposed.\r\nI now turn to another aspect of reform, which is\r\nthe expansion of the Security Council. The\r\noverwhelming majority of the Organization’s Member\r\nStates demand its enlargement but cannot find a way of\r\ndoing that under the Organization’s currently blocked\r\nsystem. It has already been 10 years since our\r\ndelegations began reflecting and writing on that\r\nobjective, without success. The issue is still so current\r\nthat, during his press conference on the report on the\r\nreform of the United Nations, the Secretary-General\r\nwas asked whether the Security Council is democratic.\r\nI will read his answer, which I find admirable because\r\nit serves as a double lesson in diplomacy and politics:\r\n“I think the system at the United Nations,\r\nwhether in the Council or the General Assembly,\r\nis reasonably democratic. If one country prevails\r\nin a group of 15, then the other 14 have agreed\r\nwith it. A veto can block a decision; it cannot\r\nmake a decision. To make a decision, you need\r\nnine votes, and other members have to go along\r\nwith you. So if one country gets its way, then\r\nothers have voted or acquiesced.” (Press release\r\nSG/SM/8397, p. 4)\r\nIn other words, that elegant response blames no\r\none, for the responsibility lies with all Member States,\r\nand it is their problem if they let it bother them. In fact,\r\nwe have grown comfortable with nursing our\r\ngrievances while enduring, without complaint, the\r\nwrongs of an outdated system, as if the tragedies that\r\nwe are now experiencing simply did not exist, as if the\r\nrebuffs that the Council receives from some parties\r\nnever happen and as if a Government, contested in its\r\nown hallways and on the street, refuses even to\r\nundertake a cabinet reshuffle.\r\nTen years of discussion is too long a time to\r\nreshuffle an unpopular cabinet. The principles of\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\ndemocracy that we have been taught demand that the\r\nmajority be free to express itself, that it be able to\r\norganize to make its voice clearly heard, and that it\r\npresent proposals and formulas that have already been\r\navailable for years and on which we can agree. The\r\npowerful cannot ignore for too long the world that\r\nsurrounds them. Over the past few years, several\r\nindividuals have presented ideas that could have served\r\nas a good working basis. I am thinking particularly of\r\nthe initiatives of former General Assembly President\r\nMr. Ismail Razali of Malaysia and former Ambassador\r\nRichard Holbrooke of the United States. But neither\r\nhad a long enough mandate and perhaps the timing was\r\nnot appropriate. The world was still at that time\r\nrelatively prosperous and terrorism had not taken on\r\nthe dimensions that it has today.\r\nThe Council was enlarged for the first time in\r\n1963, from 11 to 15 members, and we numbered some\r\n70 countries at the time. Our predecessors were clearly\r\nwiser than we are.\r\nA sort of gentlemen’s agreement was outlined in\r\nthe individual initiatives that I have just mentioned,\r\nwhich propose a Council ranging from 24 to 26\r\nmembers. That is a very manageable number and it is a\r\nworking basis that could be useful to us as a frame of\r\nreference.\r\nWe should also recall that a large majority of\r\nMember States believe that the expansion should\r\ninvolve permanent as well as non-permanent members.\r\nIf that proposal were adopted, we could then move on\r\nto the distribution between permanent and non-\r\npermanent members. That distribution should be\r\npursued, and if possible, completed by representatives\r\nof the geographic groups at the current session.\r\nIf we want a “Directoire” that is more democratic\r\nand more representative of international reality, we\r\nmust also agree on the criteria for enlargement. During\r\nthe meetings of the Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil Reform, my delegation suggested some\r\nreference points that we would do well to reconcile,\r\nsince, as a matter of principle, if we are still\r\nnegotiating, it is because we have not yet reached\r\nagreement. We could make the following suggestions\r\nfor criteria, but it is not a complete list: first,\r\ngeographical representation — the golden rule of our\r\nOrganization; secondly, economic significance and\r\nfinancial contributions of the countries. Japan and\r\nGermany fall into that category. Thirdly, the human\r\nmagnitude of highly populated countries; I repeat,\r\nhighly populated; fourthly, the use of systems of\r\nrotation, such as the one requested by Africa, which is\r\nalso claiming two permanent seats.\r\nFifthly, we should take identities and cultures into\r\naccount. The complexity of today’s world requires that.\r\nOur enlarged Council should unite Western, Buddhist,\r\nAfrican, Arab-Muslim, Latin American, Japanese and\r\nHindu civilizations; and, as I said, my list is not\r\nexhaustive. Those rules, then, should apply to\r\npermanent members, who would all have the same\r\nrights. The negotiations on the non-permanent\r\nmembers should be even simpler, since we already\r\nhave practices that are well established and accepted by\r\nall.\r\nI will now say a few words on the veto. If we\r\nwere to reread the declarations made over the last few\r\nyears to the Working Group on Security Council\r\nReform, we would be struck by the moral and political\r\nconsiderations urging unity of the Council and the\r\nunilateral or collective commitment not to make use of\r\nthe veto, or even urging moderation. That nonsense has\r\nno legal validity. In law, a door is either open or closed.\r\nThe veto either exists or it does not exist. We are not\r\nsuch dreamers as to believe, at this stage of\r\ninternational relations, that the veto can be completely\r\neliminated. However, we do believe that we could\r\nmake the situation more acceptable by requiring at\r\nleast three permanent members to oppose a resolution.\r\nBut we must do away with the single veto. We must do\r\naway with the single veto.\r\nThese remarks have no other purpose than to\r\nmake this Organization and its Security Council more\r\ncredible. We must, therefore, undertake a reform of the\r\nUnited Nations government and introduce to it, after 57\r\nyears, a greater degree of democracy.\r\nMr. Kmoníček (Czech Republic): I should like at\r\nthe outset to express appreciation for the idea of\r\norganizing a joint debate on the report of the Security\r\nCouncil and the question of equitable representation on\r\nand increase in the membership of the Council. There\r\nare commonalities in these two agenda items and we\r\ncan save time as well as avoid duplication by\r\ndiscussing them together. Moreover, the new format of\r\nthe report sends a clear signal that change is\r\npossible — a signal that will, I hope, be transmitted to\r\nthe battlefields on which we have been struggling with\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nCouncil reform and enlargement for eight consecutive\r\nyears.\r\nThe report’s new format is not revolutionary, but\r\nit makes the document more user-friendly and provides\r\na very useful overview, including in its introductory\r\nwrap-up section. Another considerable improvement is\r\nthe adjustment of the time period covered by the report.\r\nIn general, the improvements that have been introduced\r\ninto the report deserve to be acknowledged as a\r\npositive development leading to greater accountability\r\nand transparency in the work of the Security Council,\r\nalthough they may still fall short of our expectations. I\r\npraise all those who invested their efforts, under the\r\nguidance of Ambassador Mahbubani of Singapore, so\r\nas to make this new format possible.\r\nThe report also adds to the evidence that there is\r\nan ongoing dynamic in the area of the working\r\nmethods of the Council. Although some of the changes\r\nseem to have been somewhat self-propelled by the\r\nCouncil, others may have been at least inspired by the\r\ndiscussions in the Open-ended Working Group. Such\r\nmay be the case with regard to, inter alia, the\r\nrelationship between the Council and troop-\r\ncontributing countries; the opening up of private\r\nmeetings; the conduct of some open Council meetings;\r\nand communicating and reporting to non-members. In\r\nany case, there is little doubt that the Council has\r\nbenefited from the work being done by the Working\r\nGroup with regard to cluster II issues, as well as from\r\nthe increased interaction between the Council and the\r\nWorking Group over the previous two years. I therefore\r\nencourage the Bureau of the Working Group to\r\ncontinue the practice of inviting Council\r\nrepresentatives to have an interactive discussion with\r\nthe Group, and I believe that further progress on the\r\nworking methods and transparency of the Council is\r\npossible.\r\nUnfortunately, on the other front — that of\r\nequitable representation on the Council and increase in\r\nits membership — the picture is rather gloomy. In last\r\nyear’s debate on this subject, which took place in the\r\nwake of the horrible terrorist attack, I expressed the\r\nview that as international security in the context of\r\nglobalized crime calls for broader coalitions for\r\ncollective action by as many States as possible, the\r\nneed for a truly representative Council becomes more\r\nurgent. But the atmosphere in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup did not improve, and its progress on cluster I\r\nissues is, perhaps, more stalled now than ever before.\r\nThe position of the Czech Republic on cluster I\r\nissues is well known and seems to be close to the\r\nmainstream of opinion. Most notably, we favour\r\nenlargement in the categories of both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent members, as well as some reduction in\r\nareas where the veto can be applied, possibly through\r\nvoluntary commitments by permanent members, and\r\nother steps which do not necessarily require Charter\r\namendment. But in the past we have also argued for a\r\ndegree of flexibility, in the expectation that flexibility\r\nmay be shown by others as well.\r\nIt would, for example, be extremely helpful if we\r\ncould narrow down the range of options we repeatedly\r\ndiscuss in the Working Group on issues such as the use\r\nof the veto, numbers with regard to the enlargement of\r\nCouncil and other issues. Indeed, we already have more\r\nthan enough options to choose from and, contrary to\r\nwhat happened during the previous session, we should\r\nmove in only one direction: towards reducing the\r\nnumber of these options so as to get closer to the core\r\nof the matter.\r\nEven if there were some progress on cluster I, it\r\nwould on its own be unlikely to make the reform a\r\nreality. We should definitely not, therefore, lose sight\r\nof other reform vistas, including those indicated in the\r\nso-called farewell statement of Mr. Holkeri, President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session, on 10\r\nSeptember 2001, especially his idea of moving our\r\ndiscussion to a higher political level.\r\nMr. Levitte (France) (spoke in French): I would\r\nlike first of all to join in the unanimous condemnation\r\nexpressed in the Assembly and, yesterday, in the\r\nSecurity Council, with regard to the Bali tragedy. I\r\nwould like, on behalf of France, to convey our\r\ncondolences to the bereaved families, both Indonesian\r\nand those of other countries.\r\n I have no intention of reviewing all the subjects\r\ndealt with by the Security Council in the period\r\ncovered by the report before the General Assembly. It\r\nseems important to me, however, to take this\r\nopportunity to stress the progress made in the past few\r\nmonths by the Council, in improving its working\r\nmethods on the one hand, and increasing the\r\ntransparency of its work and its openness on the other.\r\nFinally, I would like to comment in particular on the\r\nwork of the Security Council on two items that appear\r\nin the introduction of the report: sanctions and the\r\nGreat Lakes region of Africa.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nThe Security Council is making rapid progress in\r\nits working methods. The report submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the period 16 June 2001 to 31\r\nJuly 2002 well reflects this positive evolution. Thanks\r\nto the work of the Working Group on documentation\r\nand procedure, and in particular the impetus provided\r\nby the delegation of Singapore, the format of the\r\nannual report has been considerably improved, as a\r\nnumber of speakers have pointed out. The report before\r\nthe Assembly is more concise than in the past and\r\noverlaps less with other United Nations publications.\r\nIts content is thus more easily accessible and more\r\nuseful.\r\nIn particular, it includes for the first time an\r\nintroduction on substantive questions. This — the fruit\r\nof the collective endeavours of the members of the\r\nCouncil at the initiative of the delegation of the United\r\nKingdom — presents an overview of the principal\r\nactions taken by the Council over the past year. While\r\nthat supplement does not constitute the analysis that\r\nmany would like to see included in the annual report, it\r\nis a step in the right direction. It could be further\r\nimproved next year. To take up the point raised by\r\nAmbassador Mahbubani at the beginning of our\r\ndiscussion, the Council may still be a conservative\r\ninstitution, but the progress achieved since its creation\r\nhas been enormous, and that should be recognized.\r\nThe Security Council has demonstrated once\r\nagain over the past year its ability to innovate and to\r\nimprove the organization of its work. Several past\r\nPresidents thus set forth monthly objectives, following\r\nthe initiative taken along these lines by the French\r\ndelegation in September 2001. Furthermore, monthly\r\npublic wrap-up meetings are being held increasingly in\r\norder to put on record the work done by the Security\r\nCouncil and to elicit the views of members of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This beginning of a culture of\r\nevaluation of their work by the members of the Council\r\nis something that should be encouraged\r\nDuring the period 2001-2002, the members of the\r\nCouncil pursued a policy of transparency in their work,\r\nas is shown by the record number of public meetings\r\nheld in the period under review — meetings that\r\nfacilitated fruitful discussion.\r\nBut it is the quality of the debates, rather than the\r\nquantity of the meetings, that counts. The interactive\r\ncharacter of such discussions could, of course, be\r\nimproved. Our public debates do meet the legitimate\r\nexpectation of the members of the General Assembly\r\nthat they be regularly informed about major issues. At\r\nthe request of members of the Council, the Secretariat\r\nalso is now regularly making public statements on such\r\nimportant questions as the Middle East and\r\nAfghanistan, two issues that have given rise to such a\r\nlarge part of the Council’s work since the publication\r\nof the last annual report.\r\nThe public debate on Iraq, set to begin tomorrow\r\nand which will no doubt last until Friday, will make it\r\npossible for all members who so desire to express their\r\nviews on this crucial subject before any decision is\r\ntaken by the Security Council.\r\nFurthermore, the Council has enhanced its\r\ncommunication with non-members, as is evidenced by\r\nthe excellent work done by the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee and its Chairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock,\r\nas well as by the work done by the Ad Hoc Working\r\nGroup on Africa, under the guidance of Ambassador\r\nJagdish Koonjul.\r\nThe second point that I should like to highlight is\r\ntransparency and accessibility in the work of the\r\nSecurity Council; these two aspects go hand in hand.\r\nThe Security Council, pursuant to resolution 1353\r\n(2001), has continued to hold frequent consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries — consultations that\r\nwere inaugurated under the French presidency of the\r\nSecurity Council, in September 2001. The\r\nstrengthening of this cooperation is entirely desirable.\r\nThese meetings must provide a further opportunity for\r\na meaningful dialogue among members of the Council\r\nand those countries contributing to United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nThe Security Council is reaching out even to civil\r\nsociety, as shown by the Arria-formula meetings held\r\nat the request of non-governmental organizations and\r\nof representatives of groups concerned by the conflicts\r\nof which the Council is seized. These informal\r\nmeetings have been particularly useful inasmuch as\r\nthey provide additional information to the members of\r\nthe Council on key issues.\r\nThis increased openness should also be reflected\r\nin the composition of the Security Council itself. As\r\nthe French Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nMr. Dominique de Villepin, recalled in his statement\r\nhere on 12 September, France would like to see the\r\nCouncil become more representative through an\r\nexpansion of its composition in both categories —\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\npermanent and non-permanent. France particularly\r\nsupports the aspirations of Germany, Japan and India to\r\nbecome permanent members.\r\nThis desirable expansion of the Security Council\r\nshould benefit the developed countries and make\r\npossible better representation of developing countries.\r\nWe should, however, bear in mind the emergence of\r\nnew Powers and also enable the Security Council to\r\ncontinue to discharge its mandate under the Charter.\r\nThirdly, the record of the Council’s work in 2001-\r\n2002 seems to us positive overall. Members of the\r\nAssembly will welcome the progress made in many\r\nareas, including, first and foremost, in the combat\r\nagainst terrorism since the adoption of resolution 1373\r\n(2001), as well as in Afghanistan, under the leadership\r\nof the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi. Nor can we fail to mention\r\nSierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Timor-Leste,\r\nwhich became a Member of our Organization following\r\nits independence. In all these successes, the Security\r\nCouncil fully discharged its responsibilities.\r\nOf course, progress has been slower in other\r\nareas. I should like to stress the need to continue to\r\nmake progress on the question of sanctions. The\r\nSecurity Council has learned to make better use of this\r\ninstrument. The sanctions imposed by the Council are\r\ntoday more carefully targeted; the idea of their limited\r\nduration has been introduced; and their humanitarian\r\nconsequences are better taken into account. Better\r\nfollow-up to sanctions has made it possible to lift the\r\nmost recent sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic\r\nof Yugoslavia as well as those on the Sudan, in\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\nHowever, we must continue to refine this means\r\nof action to make it more efficient and less harmful to\r\nthe people of the countries concerned.\r\nI should like to conclude by stressing the\r\nusefulness of Security Council missions to regions\r\naffected by conflict with which it is dealing. As was\r\nstressed by Ambassador Belinga-Eboutou in his\r\nintroduction of the annual report, Africa continues to\r\nrepresent a major part of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. Having had the honour in May this year of\r\nleading the Security Council mission to the Great\r\nLakes region, I was able to see for myself once again\r\nhow useful it is for the members of the Council to have\r\ndirect contact with all the parties concerned. It must be\r\nrecognized that the situation in the Great Lakes region\r\nhas also seen considerable progress recently, a fact that\r\nis worth noting.\r\nThe Council must take every opportunity offered\r\nto hear the parties and also to transmit to them\r\ntirelessly its own messages, because ultimately they do\r\nhave an effect. Indeed, since the drafting of the report\r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly, a\r\nnumber of the Council’s requests have been heeded:\r\ndirect contacts with heads of State; beginning of the\r\nwithdrawal of foreign troops from the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, as well as the beginning of the\r\nprocess of disarmament of armed groups; and internal\r\ndialogue, which right now is making progress. In a\r\nword, it is the continued commitment of the\r\ninternational community, in particular of the Security\r\nCouncil in New York and in the field, that is ultimately\r\nbearing fruit. France, as Ambassador Greenstock has\r\nsaid, will continue, in close cooperation with Great\r\nBritain, to work with all the members of the Security\r\nCouncil to ensure that Africa remains the focus of its\r\nattention.\r\nMr. Saleh (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): I should\r\nlike at the outset to express my appreciation to the\r\noutgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo, for the tireless efforts he made during his\r\npresidency of the General Assembly during the last\r\nsession and during his chairmanship of the Working\r\nGroup on Security Council reform. We also wish the\r\nnew President of the General Assembly every success.\r\nWe are confident that he will carry out the Assembly’s\r\nwork successfully.\r\nThe General Assembly has devoted a great deal\r\nof attention to the question of equitable representation\r\nin the Security Council, which has been on the agenda\r\nof the General Assembly since 1979. Thus, the debates\r\neventually led to the establishment of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the Question of Equitable\r\nRepresentation on and Increase in the Membership of\r\nthe Security Council and Other Matters Related to the\r\nSecurity Council. In 1993, the Working Group took the\r\nfirst step towards reforming the Security Council, the\r\nmain United Nations organ responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is an\r\nextremely important and urgent matter. It is therefore\r\nnecessary that we redouble our efforts to achieve that\r\ngoal. When the United Nations was created, it had only\r\n51 members; there are now 191. The Security Council\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nis therefore no longer representative of the full\r\nmembership of the Organization. It is also true that the\r\nnumber of items on the Council’s agenda since the end\r\nof the cold war has continuously increased. The\r\nCouncil has thus become more active and seized of\r\never more questions.\r\nFrom 1978 to 1989 the Security Council adopted\r\nabout 18 resolutions every year, while from 1990 to\r\n2001 it adopted about 61 every year. This demonstrates\r\nthe greater number and variety of matters before the\r\nCouncil, including HIV/AIDS, women and peace, the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict and, since 11\r\nSeptember 2001, terrorism. Moreover, we have seen\r\nthe establishment of a record number of bodies under\r\nArticle 29 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nAll these and other changes require us to focus\r\nour efforts on and pay greater attention to debates in\r\nthe General Assembly to achieve the Security Council\r\nreform that we all ardently desire. While such\r\ndeliberations have been going on for 23 years, the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group has spent nine years on\r\nthis question. This has been very costly to the United\r\nNations and the international community. We all seek a\r\nSecurity Council that is more representative,\r\ndemocratic, transparent and effective. The reform we\r\nall desire is limited neither to increasing the Council’s\r\nmembership in both categories, nor to improving its\r\nworking methods; we must also try to make the\r\nCouncil more effective in objectively and\r\nprofessionally addressing world concerns and affairs.\r\nThe Council must no longer be prey to double\r\nstandards, as has been pointed out more than once. In\r\nthis respect, the permanent members must make every\r\neffort to stop the use of the veto. The fact that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is holding an increasing number of\r\nspecial sessions under the Uniting For Peace resolution\r\nof 1950 demonstrates the Security Council’s\r\npowerlessness, due to an increasing use of the veto that\r\nis obstructing its work. The Security Council must be\r\nmore representative of the international community and\r\nshould strive to work on behalf of the most noble\r\nobjective of the United Nations: the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is not\r\ndiscussed in the United Nations alone; it is also a\r\nsubject of concern to other entities and agencies and to\r\nnon-governmental, research and scientific\r\norganizations. All of these have worked assiduously to\r\naddress this issue and to present their views on the best\r\nway to reform the Security Council and to strengthen\r\nits role as the primary United Nations organ\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security in a world bristling with threats and rife\r\nwith armed conflicts.\r\nIn debating Security Council reform, we must not\r\nforget events that have occurred over the past five\r\nyears, in particular the changes to which we have\r\nreferred. More open and public meetings of the\r\nSecurity Council have been held since 1998, enhancing\r\nits transparency. This is the kind of change that should\r\nbe encouraged and welcomed; it can only help the\r\nWorking Group in its debates on questions relating to\r\nthe Council’s working methods.\r\nWe are approaching the end of the year and the\r\nWorking Group will soon be celebrating its tenth\r\nanniversary. The Security Council must therefore\r\nintensify its efforts, together with the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and all States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, to ensure that the Working Group’s\r\ndebates will ultimately bear fruit. We should also try to\r\nensure that the General Assembly and the Working\r\nGroup convene high-level meetings in order to\r\ncomplete the process of reform. Tens and even\r\nhundreds of proposals have been made and considered.\r\nSuch proposals have been the subject of lengthy but\r\ninconclusive debate. No results will be achieved until\r\nthe question of Security Council reform is made a\r\npriority of the General Assembly’s agenda. When that\r\noccurs, the matter will be taken up at the highest levels.\r\nI wish to touch briefly on the Security Council’s\r\nreport to the General Assembly. We welcome the\r\nimprovements that have been made to the report. Its\r\nanalytical introduction is a laudable change. It is\r\npossible to make it even more analytical without\r\nincreasing the length of the report. That is just what we\r\nall seek. We all want the report to be less redundant\r\nand more analytical. We note that the report is more\r\nsuccinct this year. That, too, is what we have always\r\ncalled for. The contents of the report, however, must be\r\nimproved. It must be made more useful to delegations;\r\nif it is, we will save time, effort and money.\r\nWe are well aware that there are many areas of\r\ncontention in the Council with regard to the items on\r\nits agenda, but that is no reason why those matters\r\ncannot be considered more effectively. What we want\r\nis for the concerns of all delegations to be reflected in\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nthe Security Council’s reports. That could only help all\r\nMember States — especially those that are not\r\nmembers of the Security Council — to keep abreast of\r\nthe information and objective analyses contained in the\r\nCouncil’s reports.\r\nMr. Heinbecker (Canada): First of all I offer my\r\ncondolences to the people of Indonesia, Australia and\r\nall the other countries that lost citizens and whose\r\ncitizens suffered so many injuries in the terrible attacks\r\nin Bali, Canada included.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Council, and\r\nparticularly the efforts of the delegation of Singapore,\r\nto improve the presentation of the Council’s report to\r\nthe General Assembly. At half the length of previous\r\nyears, it is more readable, and its introduction,\r\ncontaining an analytical summary, is an innovation\r\nworth preserving.\r\nCanada made a number of suggestions on\r\nimproving the report at the last General Assembly, with\r\na view to reducing duplication, size and cost, and we\r\nare happy to note that a number of those proposals\r\nhave been taken into account. We believe that the\r\nanalytical overview would be more useful if it were\r\nmore candid on the plus and minus sides of the\r\nequation. The report remains too lengthy. It is a useful\r\nsummary for researchers but of less immediate use to\r\nMember States.\r\nLast year, I made a number of critical comments\r\non the working methods of the Council with respect to\r\nits continuing preference for conducting business\r\nbehind closed doors, the private Secretariat briefings to\r\nthe Council, whose contents could easily have been\r\ncommunicated to other Member States, and the absence\r\nof any meaningful interactive debate. I fear we still\r\nhave progress to make in all three areas.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAt the same time, I do wish to go on record that\r\nthe Council deserves credit for its work on a number of\r\nfronts — for example, its increased attention to the\r\nproblems of Africa, including the establishment of the\r\nSierra Leone Court, its sustained interest in the\r\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict, and the\r\ncontinued excellent work of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee. At the same time, I must also register our\r\ndisappointment that we have yet to see the long-\r\nawaited report of the sanctions Working Group, work\r\nthat we initiated when Canada was on the Council two\r\nyears ago.\r\nWe recognize that on some issues, the Council\r\nsometimes needs to meet privately. We do not think\r\nthat closed-door decision-making should be the norm.\r\nWe acknowledge that in some respects the Council has,\r\nto its credit, improved transparency. We have seen an\r\nincrease in the number of public meetings, in private\r\nmeetings open to all Members, greater openness in the\r\nwork of the Council’s subsidiary organs, particularly\r\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee, and an increase in\r\nArria-formula meetings. But there is still a need for\r\ngreater responsiveness.\r\nIt is important that Council members meet with\r\nnon-member States before making its decisions and\r\neven more so that it pay serious attention to what the\r\nmembership has to say when those meetings do occur.\r\nWe recall that it was only under considerable pressure\r\nfrom non-members earlier this year, that the Council\r\nagreed to an open debate on the International Criminal\r\nCourt before taking its decision. Unfortunate as we\r\nregard that decision, it would have been still more so in\r\nthe absence of an open debate. When issues of great\r\nprinciple or political impact are decided in the Council,\r\nconsulting the broader membership in advance of\r\nmaking the decision should be automatic and not\r\nelective.\r\nOn a related point, the jury remains out on the\r\neffectiveness of new arrangements for consultations\r\nwith troop-contributing countries. In the view of my\r\nGovernment, more needs to be done in this respect, but\r\nwe recognize that a useful start has been made.\r\nThe Security Council’s working methods and\r\nprocedures should move ahead in tandem with the\r\nSecretary-General’s efforts at broader United Nations\r\nreform. We are attracted by his suggestion, in his\r\nrecently issued report on strengthening the\r\nOrganization, that the Council should codify its current\r\npractices.\r\nIn one crucial area, the Council is actually\r\nregressing. The unelected five permanent members are\r\narrogating to themselves privileges that are found\r\nnowhere in the Charter. The elected, non-permanent\r\nten — elected, non-permanent ten — are being treated\r\nsystematically as second-class citizens. The five\r\npermanent members are meeting among themselves\r\nopenly, even brazenly, and deliberately excluding the\r\nnon-permanent members. Senior Secretariat officials,\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nby their participation in such privileged gatherings, are\r\nlending themselves to this practice. Certain of the draft\r\nresolutions on Iraq were given to the media before they\r\nwere given to the elected members of the Council. One\r\nsuch resolution would even sanctify a privileged role\r\nfor the five permanent members, both as an entity and\r\nas individual members. This arrogation of privileges\r\nundermines the representativeness of the Council, to\r\nthe ultimate detriment of the permanent members\r\nthemselves, as well as to the rest of us. We call on the\r\nfive permanent members to respect the Charter and its\r\nprinciples which have worked well for the past 50\r\nyears. Power has its privileges; there is no need also to\r\nlegislate them.\r\nFinally, on the issue of procedures, specifically\r\nvetoes, the need for the five permanent members to\r\nrestrain their recourse to the veto or to the threat of the\r\nveto is well known to everyone present. On the issue of\r\nCouncil membership, we also believe that while there\r\nis merit in a limited expansion in the non-permanent\r\nmembership category of the Security Council, and in\r\namending the rules of self-succession, we continue to\r\ndoubt the wisdom of expansion in the permanent\r\nmembership category. There are better ways forward to\r\na more responsive Council, which can attract the\r\nsupport of the totality of Members. There are ways of\r\nmaking the Council more representative without\r\nendorsing new privileges in perpetuity. We should use\r\nthem.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): At the outset, I\r\nwish to associate myself with other delegations in\r\nexpressing my appreciation to Ambassador Martin\r\nBelinga-Eboutou, Permanent Representative of\r\nCameroon and current President of the Security\r\nCouncil, for his lucid introduction of the annual report\r\nof the Council for the period 16 June 2001 to 31 July\r\n2002.\r\nI would also like to thank the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo, and Ambassadors Thorsteinn Ingólfsson of\r\nIceland and Patricia Durrant of Jamaica for the concise\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group on Security\r\nCouncil Reform.\r\nI would like to recall that last year, my delegation\r\njoined the clarion call of most Member States for\r\nimprovement in the report and in the procedures and\r\nworking methods of the Security Council. In this\r\nconnection, permit me to congratulate the members of\r\nthe Council and especially the delegation of Singapore,\r\nwhich, we are informed, was instrumental in the\r\nadoption of the new format of the report. Although the\r\nCouncil had a very busy year, this report is not only\r\ncompact and more reader-friendly, as compared to\r\nprevious ones, but also less costly.\r\nWe are particularly appreciative of the effort that\r\nhas been made to accommodate the views of Member\r\nStates in the introduction of the report, which attempts\r\nto provide an analytical summary of the work of the\r\nCouncil for the period under review. While recognizing\r\nthis as a step in the right direction towards\r\ntransparency, we urge the Council to work assiduously\r\nto improve upon the analytical framework since, as\r\npresently constituted, the report lacks the requisite\r\ninformation needed to evaluate the Council’s work.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation would have\r\nappreciated a frank assessment by members of the\r\nCouncil of their work, especially since, for the first\r\ntime, they took the welcome step of discussing the\r\nreport before adopting it for submission to the General\r\nAssembly. For example, the section on the Middle East\r\ncould have been more informative on problems the\r\nCouncil encountered in implementing its resolutions.\r\nSimilarly, the portion on the all-important issue of\r\nsanctions was given scant treatment.\r\nIt is our considered view that underpinning\r\nArticle 24, paragraph 3, and Article 15, paragraph 1. of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations are the hallowed\r\nprinciples of responsibility, accountability and\r\ntransparency, and much more should be done to ensure\r\nthat those principles are observed by the Security\r\nCouncil in its relations with the General Assembly.\r\nAnother praiseworthy initiative is the Council’s\r\ndecision to interact with non-State and non-\r\ngovernmental entities as a way of bridging the gap\r\nbetween Council members and the outside world at a\r\ntime when the Security Council is dealing with many\r\ncross-sectoral issues. Yet the report is virtually silent\r\non this partnership, which is important, especially in a\r\nglobalizing world.\r\nOne of the most innovative ways for the Council\r\nto acquire first-hand information on conflict areas is\r\nthrough its missions to afflicted countries. My\r\ndelegation would therefore, in future, like to see more\r\ninformation provided in the report on such trips if the\r\nCouncil is going to continue to rely on this system, as\r\nwe think it should.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nWe are also encouraged by the number of open\r\nmeetings and the monthly briefings given by Presidents\r\nof the Council, as well as by the periodic wrap-up\r\nsessions to which non-member States were invited.\r\nElsewhere, we wish to commend the Council for\r\nplaying a pivotal role in the global campaign against\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee has been a shinning\r\nexample of transparency, and we congratulate its\r\nChairman, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, for the yeoman’s job\r\nhe has done. It is our fervent hope that this effort,\r\nworthy of emulation, will be followed by the Council\r\nin its dealings with Member States in other areas.\r\nAt this juncture, let me express my Government’s\r\nheartfelt condolences and sympathy to the\r\nGovernments and peoples of Indonesia and Australia,\r\nas well as to the families of the victims of the recent\r\nhorrific terrorist attack in Bali.\r\nWe also applaud the establishment of a\r\nmechanism to further improve cooperation between the\r\nCouncil and troop-contributing countries, especially\r\nthe growing regularity and frequency of the meetings.\r\nMy delegation believes that this consultative\r\nmechanism can be beneficial to all the parties involved\r\nin peacekeeping. We urge the Council to continue its\r\npeacekeeping activities and its comprehensive\r\napproach to dealing with conflict prevention, resolution\r\nand management, especially in Africa, if this least\r\ndeveloped region is ever to achieve peace and security,\r\nwhich are indispensable ingredients in any serious\r\nattempt to promote sustainable development.\r\nEqually important in our view is the partnership\r\nbetween the Security Council and regional\r\norganizations, since the regional dimension can\r\nsometimes be useful in dealing with conflicts. Since\r\nthe Council spends 60 to 75 per cent of its time on\r\nAfrica, we welcome the establishment of an Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Africa under the chairmanship of\r\nthe Ambassador of Mauritius. There have been positive\r\ndevelopments in Sierra Leone and Angola, but Africa\r\nis not yet out of the woods, and the Council will have\r\nto redouble its efforts in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, Liberia and Burundi.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe consideration of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil is taking place at a momentous time in history\r\nwhen, because of the Iraqi problem, the eyes of the\r\ninternational community are focused on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as the body with collective\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Naturally, under the circumstances,\r\nthe role of the Security Council, which has the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, has come to the fore.\r\nIf the collective responsibility which lies at the\r\nfoundation of the United Nations requires and demands\r\nthe cooperation of all Member States, the Security\r\nCouncil, on which the Charter imposes the primary\r\nobligation to maintain peace and security, cannot\r\ndischarge this onerous responsibility unless its\r\nmembership is truly representative and reflects the\r\ncomposition of this lofty Organization which currently\r\nstands at 191 members.\r\nMoreover, one of the major items before the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly is the reform\r\nof the United Nations. The Security Council, as one of\r\nthe main organs of the United Nations, which since the\r\nend of the cold war has assumed more functions and\r\nhas in the process become more powerful, should be a\r\ncritical plank in the United Nations reform agenda.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation wishes to reiterate\r\nthe need to enhance the credibility of the Council\r\nthrough substantive reform guided by the principles of\r\ndemocracy, the sovereign equality of States and\r\nequitable geographical representation. A reformed\r\nSecurity Council should be transparent in its activities\r\nand more responsive to the interests of the general\r\nmembership in matters deriving from its mandate under\r\nthe Charter. Advocacy for democratic governance and\r\ntransparency should be applicable at both the national\r\nand international levels. This is more so as all Member\r\nStates of the United Nations are called upon and\r\nobliged to share the burden of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security through, inter alia,\r\nassessed contributions to the peacekeeping budget, the\r\nprovision of troops for United Nations peacekeeping\r\nmissions and implementation of resolutions adopted by\r\nthe Security Council under Chapter VII of the United\r\nNations Charter.\r\nAgainst that background, Ghana continues to\r\nsubscribe to the Non-Aligned Movement’s position on\r\nall aspects of the question of the increase in the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, complemented by\r\nthe African position as expressed in the Harare\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nDeclaration of June 1997. Africa — the largest regional\r\ngroup in the Organization — which has called for the\r\nallocation of two permanent rotating seats and two\r\nadditional non-permanent seats, is, paradoxically, the\r\nonly region excluded from the category of permanent\r\nmembers.\r\nA periodic review of an enlarged Security\r\nCouncil must be an integral part of the whole reform\r\npackage. It is our view that a review of the Council\r\nevery 10 years will ensure continuity and flexibility to\r\nenable it to adapt to changing international realities.\r\nIt would be remiss on my part if I did not touch\r\non the veto power granted to the five permanent\r\nmembers. While acknowledging the view of the five\r\npermanent members that the veto is an important tool\r\nin the discharge of the Council’s responsibilities, we\r\nbelieve that it also stifles discussions and consensus,\r\nand we call for its restricted use and the eventual\r\nabolition of that undemocratic and anachronistic\r\nmechanism.\r\nMy delegation is committed to the reform process\r\nin the Security Council and elsewhere in the United\r\nNations system, and we are ready to join others in that\r\nundertaking.\r\nFinally, I would like to congratulate Angola,\r\nChile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain on their election to\r\nthe Security Council. We entreat them to bear in mind\r\nthe need to respect the wishes of our leaders by\r\ntranslating into reality their resolve, expressed at the\r\nMillennium Summit, inter alia, to intensify efforts to\r\nachieve a comprehensive reform of the Security\r\nCouncil in all its aspects. I am confident that the new\r\nmembers will work in concert with the other members\r\nfor a more transparent, accountable, efficient and\r\nrepresentative Security Council, in line with the\r\ngeneral reform of the United Nations, in order to make\r\nthe Organization more effective in meeting the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nMs. Ognjanovac (Croatia): The new format in\r\nthe report of the Security Council and the changes\r\nmade therein are valuable. The report has been\r\ntransformed into a genuine working instrument. It is\r\nmore reader-friendly and more organized. We\r\nespecially welcome the analytical introduction, which\r\nwe consider a good start. We commend the efforts put\r\ninto the work on the new format of the report by the\r\nmembers of the Security Council and encourage them\r\nto further develop new improvements in the next\r\nreport.\r\nThe year covered by the report was full of events\r\nthat needed the swift and efficient reaction of the\r\nSecurity Council. The Council’s response to the threat\r\nof terrorism after 11 September demonstrated the real\r\nvalue of the Council. The most important highlight of\r\nthat response was the transparent manner in which it\r\nwas made. That enabled all States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations to be fully involved in the process and\r\nto unite their forces in the struggle against terrorism,\r\nwhich thus became global. We hope that the lesson\r\nlearned from that process will be taken into account in\r\nthe Council’s future discussions and decision-making.\r\nSimilarly, the Council’s timely response to the\r\nsituation in Afghanistan, with the full involvement of\r\nCouncil non-member States that participated in the\r\npublic meetings on that subject, have put a once-grave\r\nsituation that threatened world peace and security in\r\nthe category of success stories in the Council’s report.\r\nWe commend the strengthened cooperation between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, which we believe could\r\nenhance the quality of post-conflict management. In\r\norder to encourage similar positive developments, the\r\nCouncil must ensure the full implementation of its\r\nresolutions. Innovative and successful mechanisms\r\nsuch as the Counter-Terrorism Committee may indicate\r\npossible avenues in that regard.\r\nIt is unfortunate that we may soon mark the tenth\r\nanniversary of the establishment of Open-ended\r\nWorking Group to consider all aspects of the question\r\nof increasing the membership of the Security Council\r\nand other matters related to the Council. Not much\r\nprogress has been made this year. Although many of us\r\nare ready to undertake steps to begin serious reform of\r\nthe Council’s composition and of its work, some\r\nremain reluctant. We are all aware of the fundamental\r\nchanges that have taken place in international relations\r\nsince the founding of the United Nations as well as of\r\nthe new challenges that we face today. Dealing with\r\nthose challenges requires an innovative approach and\r\nan effective global response. That is why we believe\r\nthat new resolve and energy are needed to move\r\nforward the negotiations in the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup.\r\nIt is encouraging that there have been some\r\npositive developments in the Council’s working\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nmethods, especially with regard to the new relations\r\nwith the troop-contributing countries. The Council’s\r\nwork shows greater transparency as well. However, we\r\nwould prefer to see good examples at the beginning of\r\nthe process rather than as its end results.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit, we all agreed\r\nthat we wanted a strong United Nations. We agreed\r\nthat, in order to achieve that goal, we must undertake\r\nnecessary reforms, including the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. We have the forum in which to discuss that\r\nobjective; now it is time to demonstrate the necessary\r\npolitical will.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): Let me begin by\r\njoining previous speakers in expressing our deepest\r\nsympathy and condolences to the Government of\r\nIndonesia and to the families of the victims of the\r\ntragic events that occurred in Bali.\r\nThe report of the Security Council that we are\r\nconsidering (A/57/2 and Corr.1) provides Member\r\nStates with a singular opportunity to examine and to\r\ncontribute to the fulfilment of its mandate. I welcome\r\nthat fact, and I wish to take this opportunity to\r\ncommend the Council for its report and Ambassador\r\nMartin Belinga-Eboutou for his eloquent presentation.\r\nAs noted in the report, this has been a busy year\r\nfor the Security Council. In addition to outstanding\r\nthreats to international peace and security, the events of\r\n11 September 2001 reminded us all of the dynamic\r\nnature of threats and accentuated their global nature.\r\nThe past year has made it abundantly clear that no\r\nMember State is immune from unilateral action by\r\nStates or by non-State actors when it comes to\r\nthreatening international peace and security.\r\nFor their enriching contribution to the fulfilment\r\nof the Security Council’s mandate, my delegation\r\nwould like to recognize the efforts of the delegations of\r\nMauritius, Singapore, Ireland, Norway and Colombia,\r\nwhose mandate as non-permanent members of the\r\nSecurity Council expires in December 2002. Much of\r\nwhat has been achieved towards improving the\r\nCouncil’s working methods and towards increasing the\r\ncontribution of non-members was due to their\r\ncommitment. They have set a good standard for those\r\njust elected, such as my country. I thank them all for\r\nthat.\r\nThis report is the first to have been prepared in\r\naccordance with a note of the President of the Security\r\nCouncil (S/2002/199) aimed at enhancing its quality.\r\nMoreover, it is the first to have been adopted in an\r\nopen debate. That constitutes a milestone in the\r\nprocedures of the Organization, reflecting our\r\nwillingness to improve our modus operandi.\r\nCompared with last year’s report, the current one\r\nis more reader-friendly, better organized and, despite\r\nincreased Security Council activity, less bulky. It\r\nprovides us with an improved overview of the\r\nCouncil’s activities during the past year. Those\r\nimprovements are the result not only of the efforts of\r\nCouncil members, but also of the great contribution of\r\nall United Nations members to the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform and to the\r\nwork on the revitalization of the Organization.\r\nHowever, there is room for further improvement in the\r\npresentation of the report itself and in the Council’s\r\nworking methods and procedures, in order to enhance\r\ntransparency, cooperation with other United Nations\r\nbodies and participation by non-Council members,\r\nparticularly by States concerned with the matters under\r\ndiscussion.\r\nAngola is convinced that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform is an\r\nappropriate instrument for greater reform efforts within\r\nthe Security Council, especially if all Member States\r\nparticipate fully in its deliberations. While it is\r\nimportant to respect current working methods,\r\npractices and procedures, it is equally important to\r\nachieve more openness and transparency in the\r\nCouncil’s provisional rules of procedure. We must go\r\nfurther, especially with regard to making the Security\r\nCouncil more democratic and more transparent.\r\nAngola supports the Harare Declaration of 1997,\r\nadopted by the heads of State or Government of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity — particularly Africa’s\r\nposition concerning the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil, expanding Council membership and\r\nincreasing the allocation of non-permanent seats to\r\nAfrica. In short, we need to strengthen the Council’s\r\ntransparency and to improve its working methods and\r\nits decision-making process.\r\nThe current international situation calls upon\r\nmembers of the Security Council to renew their\r\nunequivocal commitment to the Charter of the United\r\nNations in order to deal effectively with threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. Concerted and\r\ncollective action by the international community\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nresulted in the adoption of Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), clearly demonstrating that a multilateral\r\nagenda can be successfully pursued to deal with\r\ninternational terrorism. The United Nations, especially\r\nthrough the Security Council, remains our best\r\nmechanism to deal with threats to international peace\r\nand security. It is important, however, that the\r\nresolutions adopted be implemented by all Members.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s statement before the\r\nGeneral Assembly on 12 September 2002 (see\r\nA/57/PV.2) was a valuable contribution with respect to\r\nhow States must deal with principles such as\r\nmultilateralism, collectivity, responsibility and the rule\r\nof law. We in the United Nations must preserve those\r\nvalues in order to uphold international law and\r\nmaintain international order.\r\nIn accordance with the Charter, the Security\r\nCouncil is a guarantor of international peace and\r\nsecurity. This year was one of the busiest in the history\r\nof the Council. During the period under review, many\r\nissues have figured on the Council’s agenda, such as\r\ninternational terrorism, the Middle East crisis,\r\nAfghanistan, the Great Lakes region crisis, the peace\r\nprocess in Angola, Western Sahara, Sierra Leone, East\r\nTimor and, of course, more recently, Iraq, which has\r\nkept the Council very busy.\r\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo remains a great concern to my country. Angola\r\nis deeply committed to the peaceful resolution of the\r\ncrisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the\r\nGreat Lakes region. As a result of that commitment,\r\nmy country is an active participant in the\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Agreement. My country\r\nis conscious of the need to give impetus to the stalled\r\nimplementation of the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement\r\nand the recent Pretoria agreement, as well as the need\r\nto normalize relations, build confidence and bring\r\nabout good neighbourliness in order to contribute to the\r\nspeedy pacification of Central Africa and the Great\r\nLakes region and to put an end to insecurity and\r\ninstability.\r\nIn the Middle East, a resurgent wave of violence\r\nmay challenge the efforts being made toward a\r\npeaceful settlement of the Palestinian problem as well\r\nas the Israeli-Arab crisis. We would welcome efforts by\r\nthe Security Council towards facilitating a return to the\r\nnegotiating table to seek a political formula that will\r\nsatisfy the political and security interests of all\r\ninhabitants of the region.\r\nFinally, Angola recognizes the positive work of\r\nthe Security Council and of the Secretary-General,\r\nregarding the achievement of East Timor’s\r\nindependence. That is another clear and good example\r\nof how the Security Council can bring about peace\r\nunder difficult circumstances, provided we use it\r\nwisely and stand ready to abide by our collectively\r\narrived decisions. Angola is set to become another\r\nSecurity Council success story, and we are determined\r\nto work with the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations to keep enlarging the list of success\r\nstories in Africa and in the world.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): I would like to express\r\nAustria’s gratitude to Ambassador Martin Belinga-\r\nEboutou, President of the Security Council, for his\r\neloquent introduction of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil (A/57/2). At the same time, my delegation\r\ncommends the excellent work of the Secretariat in\r\ncompiling that invaluable source of reference. This\r\npresentation is a welcome continuation of the Security\r\nCouncil’s dialogue with the General Assembly on the\r\ndischarge of its duties pursuant to Article 24 of the\r\nCharter. That practice adds to the enhancement of the\r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the\r\nCouncil, bearing in mind the responsibility of the latter\r\nto act on behalf of the whole membership.\r\nI would also like to thank the former President of\r\nthe General Assembly, Mr. Han Seung-soo of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, as well as Ambassador Ingólfsson\r\nand Ambassador Durrant of Jamaica, for preparing a\r\nconcise report of the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nSecurity Council reform. Furthermore, I would like to\r\ncongratulate Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan and\r\nSpain on their election to the Security Council for the\r\nperiod 2003 and 2004.\r\nAn adequate flow of information towards non-\r\nmembers is a necessary prerequisite to understand and\r\nassess how the Council is dealing with political issues,\r\nand that should therefore be facilitated as much as\r\npossible. In our view, the President of the Security\r\nCouncil plays a crucial role in keeping the general\r\nmembership fully informed about the deliberations of\r\nthe Council. In that regard, the monthly forecast of the\r\nwork of the Council constitutes a very useful tool for\r\nthe daily work of delegations. The briefings of the\r\nrespective presidencies and the information they make\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\navailable via their homepages have further improved\r\nover the past year. In addition, the increase in public\r\nmeetings underlines the willingness of the Council to\r\ntake into account the views of Member States and to\r\nuse them as a basis for the Council’s decision-making\r\nprocess.\r\nThe inclusion of a brief analytical assessment of\r\nthe work of the Security Council in the introduction of\r\nthe report is a very positive development. The\r\nrelevance and the usefulness of that assessment could\r\nbe further increased if it would cover and analyse more\r\nextensively the decision-making process in the\r\nCouncil, instead of focusing merely on factual events.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the efforts in\r\nstreamlining the report. Substantially reducing the\r\nnumber of page of this year’s report renders it not only\r\nmore readable, but also more cost effective. It is of the\r\nutmost importance to explore further possibilities to\r\nincrease the efficiency of the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. In that respect, let me pay tribute to the efforts\r\nof Ambassador Mahbubani and the delegation of\r\nSingapore.\r\nThe experience of peacekeeping operations has\r\nclearly underlined that the Council can only act\r\nsuccessfully if it is engaged in a substantial dialogue\r\nwith the Member States. In that regard, my delegation,\r\nas a traditional provider of peacekeeping troops,\r\nparticularly welcomes the efforts of the Council to\r\nincrease the number of meetings with troop-\r\ncontributing countries and thus to improve the\r\ncooperation and coordination between the Council and\r\nthe troop-contributing countries at an early stage in the\r\nconsideration of mandates of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping missions.\r\nThe relationship between the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly is undoubtedly a central\r\nissue of the ongoing debate on reform. Especially in\r\nthe field of terrorism prevention, close cooperation and\r\ncoordination between the Council and the General\r\nAssembly is necessary. In that context, my delegation\r\nwould like to commend the highly valuable work of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, under the very able\r\nleadership of Ambassador Sir Jeremy Greenstock.\r\nThe maintenance of efficiency, as well as the\r\nhighest degree of transparency and legitimacy, are\r\nequally important goals that should guide the reform\r\nefforts of the Security Council. The High-Level\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform can come\r\nup with concrete proposals, however, only if the\r\nunderlying political impasse is overcome by a\r\nreconsideration of positions in the major capitals of the\r\nworld.\r\nI would like to express my delegation’s continued\r\nsupport for all reform efforts directed at increased\r\ntransparency, efficiency and legitimacy so that the\r\nSecurity Council can properly fulfil its mandate under\r\nthe Charter.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I join other delegations in\r\nextending condolences to the Government of Indonesia\r\nand to the families of the victims of the bomb attack in\r\nBali, Indonesia, on 12 October, which we strongly\r\ncondemn.\r\nThe work of the Security Council is of great\r\nimportance to the functioning of the multilateral\r\nsystem. In the Charter’s scheme for collective security,\r\nit exercises an important mandate and we must\r\ntherefore give great attention to its report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is submitted in accordance\r\nwith Article 24 of the Charter. We have examined the\r\nreport and commend its presentation in a format which\r\nis concise and informative.\r\nJamaica completed its term on the Council at the\r\nend of 2001 and therefore had the opportunity of being\r\na participant in the activities of that body during the\r\nperiod covered by the report. Over that year the\r\nCouncil had a very heavy workload and had to face\r\nmany difficult and complex issues. Within the range of\r\nissues covered, the Council gave significant attention\r\nto African questions on its agenda. We agree with the\r\noverall assessment of the improvement in most areas of\r\nconflict in Africa and we believe that the work of the\r\nSecretary-General’s special representatives and the\r\nSecurity Council missions to various regions, as well\r\nas the deployment of peacekeeping operations, all\r\nplayed an important part in the process of\r\nimprovement.\r\nJamaica believes that it is also of great\r\nimportance for the Council to continue to be engaged\r\nin the post-conflict period so as to consolidate the gains\r\nthat have been made and to assist in the process of\r\nreconciliation and rebuilding. This is important if we\r\nare to maintain the current momentum and ensure the\r\nachievement of durable peace and stability. These are\r\nimportant preconditions for the promotion of economic\r\nand social development, which is an urgent task facing\r\nthe national and regional communities in Africa.\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nWe also take note of the important role of the\r\nCouncil in developing a framework for combating\r\nterrorism, with the adoption of resolution 1373 (2002),\r\nand in the post-war rebuilding of Afghanistan, which\r\nwill need the continuing support of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe record also shows significant work done in\r\nthe monitoring of peacekeeping operations to promote\r\npeace and harmony in war-torn areas. This activity has\r\nbeen reasonably successful and should remain an\r\nimportant priority of the Council.\r\nWe are less satisfied with the Council’s efforts\r\nand progress in relation to the situation in the Middle\r\nEast — an arena where renewed violence presented\r\nissues which require specific and urgent attention. We\r\nbelieve that the Council’s approach could be more\r\nproactive in containing the conflict and in advancing\r\nnegotiations for a peaceful and durable settlement of\r\nthe conflict between Israel and Palestine.\r\nWe recognize that there are complex issues\r\ninvolved, but Jamaica believes that there are sufficient\r\nareas of consensus that would provide a basis for a\r\nnegotiated settlement and justify the early convening of\r\na peace conference. Bilateral and group initiatives are\r\nuseful, but it would be desirable to seek the promotion\r\nof a settlement through a multilateral framework which\r\nwould give global endorsement and legitimacy to the\r\nresult of any such process.\r\nIt is important to emphasize that, in accordance\r\nwith Article 24 of the Charter, the Security Council\r\nexercises its responsibilities on behalf of the\r\ninternational community acting in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. It is\r\ntherefore important that the Council’s decisions should\r\nserve to further the broad interests of the Organization\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nnot specific national interests. This is in accordance\r\nwith the principle of accountability, which is\r\nestablished under the Charter and is an important\r\nelement in good governance.\r\nThe other principle of good governance is that of\r\ndemocracy, which should guide the process of\r\ndecision-making within the Council. It should take into\r\naccount the views and opinions of the broader\r\nmembership and in its own deliberations give due\r\nweight to the views of all members of the Council.\r\nRegrettably, in relation to a number of matters, and\r\nespecially in connection with issues of the moment,\r\nthere are tendencies within the decision-making\r\nprocess which do not accord with these expectations.\r\nCertain practices have developed which indicate a\r\ndifferentiation of roles between permanent and non-\r\npermanent members on the basis of the pre-eminence\r\nof the veto power. Whatever the realities, it is our view\r\nthat all members should participate fully in the\r\ndecision-making process in the context of more\r\ndemocratic procedures consistent with the Charter\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States.\r\nOn the question of Security Council reform, we\r\nregret that after almost 10 years, the reform process has\r\nbeen stalled as a result of deadlock within the Open-\r\nended Working Group. This does not mean that there\r\nhas not been any progress. Consensus has been reached\r\non most cluster II issues dealing with working methods\r\nof the Council, as well as in relation to the expansion\r\nof the membership in the non-permanent category. It is\r\ntherefore important that we do not abandon the process\r\nand that we reactivate the Working Group and consider\r\napproaches which might lead to some reform. It is clear\r\nthat we need to make adjustments to meet the needs of\r\nthe United Nations membership and the demands of the\r\nchanging international environment. All of us have a\r\nstake in ensuring that the United Nations system has\r\nthe capacity to meet current and future challenges.\r\nNone is more important than those relating to war and\r\npeace, in which the Security Council plays a central\r\nrole. It is of great importance that we give support to\r\nthe United Nations at this time and reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to the system of collective security based\r\non the non-use of force, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes and respect for international law. A strong and\r\nvibrant United Nations is indispensable in the new\r\nworld order.\r\nMr. Dauth (Australia): I cannot begin today\r\nwithout expressing my appreciation and that of my\r\nGovernment for the many statements of support in a\r\nweek that has been a very difficult one for all\r\nAustralians. For us, it has been a reminder that in this\r\nHouse we are one family.\r\nFor the first time in many years, it is possible to\r\nspeak on the report of the Security Council without\r\nbemoaning its excessive length and lack of useful\r\ninformation. The new format of the report is very much\r\nthe result of Singapore’s efforts, and for this I think\r\nthat our friend and colleague Ambassador Mahbubani\r\nshould be sincerely congratulated.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nA welcome feature of the report is the new\r\ndescriptive introduction which assesses the work of the\r\nCouncil. We understand that any such assessment must\r\nnecessarily be cautious, but even in its current form it\r\nadds substantial value. We would hope that in future\r\nreports such assessments will continue and will be\r\nincreasingly candid. This would allow for a deeper and\r\nmore useful interchange between the wider United\r\nNations membership and the Security Council.\r\nTurning to the substance of the Council’s output\r\nover the period covered by the report, one cannot but\r\nbe struck by how busy the Council has been and by the\r\nhistoric importance of what has been achieved. Of the\r\nmany agenda items, I want to highlight three.\r\nEast Timor’s achievement of independence on 20\r\nMay was a most significant and welcome event. The\r\nefforts of the United Nations prior to 20 May and its\r\nongoing presence and programmes in many ways\r\nshowed the United Nations at its best. The Council’s\r\nwork in Afghanistan also deserves praise. The distance\r\nthat has been travelled there in a short space of time\r\nhas been enormous.\r\nValuable lessons can be learned from both the\r\nEast Timor and Afghanistan experiences which can\r\nhelp guide the Council in future. Three lessons are\r\nparticularly pertinent.\r\nFirst, the quality of leadership is crucial. Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi’s contribution to bringing together the Bonn\r\nAgreement and taking forward its implementation, in\r\nparticular through the holding of the Loya Jirga, has\r\nmade an enormous difference to Afghanistan.\r\nLikewise, East Timor has been very well served by the\r\nexcellent leadership provided by my friend Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello.\r\nSecondly, a creative and flexible division of\r\nlabour is necessary to deal with complex emergencies.\r\nIn Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance\r\nForce (ISAF), the coalition forces and the United\r\nNations have worked together in a very effective way,\r\ndoing together what none could have done alone.\r\nSimilarly, in East Timor, in the initial phase of the\r\ncrisis, regional countries had to shoulder\r\nresponsibilities that the United Nations could not\r\nimmediately meet.\r\nThirdly, complex emergencies do not end with the\r\nholding of elections or other symbolic events. The\r\ninternational community and the Security Council need\r\nto remain engaged, judging astutely how best to hand\r\nover responsibilities to new polities and how best to\r\nensure that investments do not vanish in a precipitous\r\nrush to find an exit.\r\nThe Security Council’s response to terrorism also\r\nneeds to be highlighted — particularly so in the light of\r\nthe heinous terrorist attack that took place in Bali over\r\nthe weekend. The Government and the people of\r\nAustralia extend their heartfelt condolences and\r\nsympathy to all the victims from all countries and to\r\ntheir families. As I said earlier, we are deeply gratified\r\nat the many expressions of sympathy, including as\r\nformally expressed in resolution 1438 (2002). We stand\r\nready to work with the Indonesian authorities and\r\nothers to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers\r\nand sponsors of the attack. My Minister is in Indonesia\r\nthis week in deep negotiations with our Indonesian\r\nfriends to that end.\r\nResolutions 1368 (2001), 1373 (2001) and 1438\r\n(2002), which, as members know, was adopted only\r\nlast night, demonstrate that a united Council can react\r\nquickly, decisively and creatively to threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. Resolution 1373\r\n(2001) and the work of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee (CTC) also showed the potential of\r\ncollective global action to address global threats.\r\nThe Bali attack again underscores the chilling\r\nfact that the fight against terrorism is by no means\r\nwon. The international community has to redouble its\r\nefforts to combat the threat. The work of the CTC is\r\ncentral to that effort. Its success owes much to the\r\ntransparent and consultative working methods, which\r\nhave elicited a high level of cooperation. The briefings\r\nprovided by the CTC Chairman, Sir Jeremy\r\nGreenstock, have set a standard that other Council\r\nCommittees should emulate. The principles of\r\ntransparency and consultation are, happily, being seen\r\nincreasingly in the Council’s working methods. We are\r\npleased with the evolution of the Council’s\r\nconsultations with troop-contributing countries and\r\nwith the trend towards open meetings.\r\nDespite the will generated at the Millennium\r\nSummit to accelerate progress towards comprehensive\r\nSecurity Council reform, little has been achieved\r\noutside the area of Council working methods. The\r\nOpen-ended Working Group made no progress last\r\nyear, but this does not mean that progress cannot be\r\nmade. New energy and creativity is needed to achieve a\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nCouncil whose composition reflects current realities\r\nrather than those of the 1940s.\r\nLet me conclude by again expressing appreciation\r\nfor the support we have had this week from the world\r\nfamily, sharing our grief at this difficult time.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I should like at the outset to convey our\r\nsympathy and feelings of solidarity to the people of\r\nIndonesia and to the families affected by the senseless\r\nattacks a few days ago in Bali that claimed the lives of\r\n200 innocent people. My delegation joins all those that\r\nhave condemned this barbaric act against innocent\r\ncivilians. Terrorism affects all of us. Ecuador regrets\r\nthe death of compatriots in this attack, which can only\r\nbe rejected. We must pledge to make every effort to\r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nIn this struggle, Ecuador supports the effective\r\nimplementation of resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390\r\n(2002) and has been carrying out a broad-based\r\ninternal strategy, including legislative, administrative,\r\npolice and other measures. In terms of our foreign\r\npolicy, we believe that in the struggle against terrorism\r\nwe must focus on its prevention and on its suppression,\r\non the understanding that this process must be based on\r\na broader and more comprehensive multilateral strategy\r\nthat is not limited to military or police action but that\r\nhas as an objective the harmonious development of all\r\npeoples.\r\nThe Security Council in 2001 had one of its most\r\nactive periods of work, as reflected in the report that is\r\nbefore the General Assembly. However, we are\r\nconcerned that a report that should be a basic reference\r\ndocument of great importance to international relations\r\nis limited to a brief summary of what was done. It\r\nprovides us with a list of meetings and resolutions that\r\nis quite lengthy but of little use. We had hoped to see a\r\nreport whose emphasis was on substance rather than on\r\nform — an analytical rather than a descriptive one. We\r\nrecognize that the comments contained in the\r\nintroduction are a step in the right direction, but we\r\nthink that a report of the Security Council must contain\r\nmore substance.\r\nIn any case, it is very satisfying to note that the\r\nSecurity Council has made consensus its way of\r\nresolving matters under its purview. All countries\r\nwould hope that the occasional breaking of this rule —\r\nmotivated by the unfortunate existence of the right of\r\nveto of some of its members — will not undermine its\r\ndemocratic and equitable working methods. The\r\ndemocratization of international bodies has been a\r\nprinciple of Ecuador’s foreign policy. This is a matter\r\nnot of mere form, but of transparent and open\r\nprocedures in universal debate.\r\nThe Security Council has had to deal with an\r\nincrease in outbreaks of violence in all its forms,\r\nincluding terrorist threats and the imposition of force\r\nover the peaceful settlement of disputes, that represent\r\nan ongoing threat to international peace and security.\r\nHowever, these efforts have achieved laudable results,\r\nsuch as the conclusion of the establishment of the State\r\nof Timor-Leste, which is a credit to the United Nations\r\nas a whole and represents the triumph of reason and the\r\nprinciples of democracy and peace in the self-\r\ndetermination of that nation.\r\nLikewise, it is encouraging that the Council’s\r\nmanagement has led to progress in the peace process in\r\nthe Great Lakes region of Africa; in the improved\r\ninternal situation in Angola; and in negotiations\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea and in Abkhazia,\r\nGeorgia. It is also gratifying to note the Council’s\r\nefforts to consolidate peace in the Balkans.\r\nThe Security Council must intensify its efforts to\r\ncreate negotiating machinery to consolidate the peace\r\nprocesses in Somalia, West Africa, Cyprus and\r\nPrevlaka. The juridical and humanitarian situation in\r\nWestern Sahara has yet to be resolved.\r\nThe Security Council must make a major effort to\r\nsecure a settlement in the Middle East, where violence\r\ntakes an almost daily toll on our consciences. Events\r\nthere have evoked our horror and repudiation. Ecuador,\r\nits people and Government hope that the peoples of\r\nIsrael and Palestine will soon be able to live in peace.\r\nWith respect to Iraq, my delegation believes that\r\nit is preferable to resort to the machinery of the\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, a principle that my\r\ndelegation has always supported.\r\nWith regard to the report of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on Security Council reform, Ecuador\r\nbelieves that the eight years of debate on this issue\r\nshould be sufficient to reach an understanding on the\r\npositions currently on the table. Machinery must now\r\nbe agreed on to break the deadlock on this issue as\r\nsoon as possible. The increasing and sporadic use of\r\nthe right of veto is a symptom of the urgent need to\r\neliminate it. Only thus can the Security Council\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nbecome a centre for debate and democratic cooperation\r\non international peace and security, without any\r\ndifferentiation between or categorization of States. An\r\nincrease in the number of non-permanent members of\r\nthe Council is also of fundamental importance and\r\nshould reflect the changes that have taken place in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe world looks to the United Nations in the hope\r\nof a better tomorrow and in the face of the paralysis\r\nand critical stagnation of political will to find\r\nsolutions. When the Security Council is incapable for\r\nany reason of preventing war and bloodshed, civil\r\nsociety throughout the world condemns it. If we wish\r\nto see a world in which all peoples can live in peace\r\nand dignity, we must implement changes in procedures\r\nthat do not respond to the challenges of modern history.\r\nMany of these procedures were put into effect more\r\nthan 50 years ago. It is now time to review them to the\r\nbenefit of all peoples belonging to the United Nations.\r\nThe world is in a highly sensitive and volatile\r\nsituation. In these circumstances, an effective,\r\ntransparent and democratic Security Council is\r\nrequired without delay if its resolutions are to be\r\nmeaningful and to embody the legitimacy and equity to\r\nwhich all States committed to the principles of\r\ndemocracy, justice and fairness aspire.\r\nMr. Loizaga (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, we join in the condemnation of the brutal\r\nattack this weekend in Bali and offer our condolences\r\nand solidarity to the Government and people of\r\nIndonesia and to the other countries that lost nationals\r\nin that event. In this respect, we welcome the adoption\r\nlast night of Security Council resolution 1438 (2002).\r\nIt is precisely that type of unanimous, speedy and\r\neffective response that the Member States expect of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIt has been decided this year to consider jointly\r\ntwo priority items on our agenda — items 11 and 40.\r\nWhile they are closely related to one another, we\r\nbelieve that they have a single objective in common: a\r\nmore democratic, representative, transparent and\r\nefficient Security Council to face the new challenges of\r\ntoday’s world. Nevertheless, by the end of this debate\r\nwe will have to determine the usefulness of keeping\r\nthis format.\r\nThe report of the Security Council to the General\r\nAssembly undoubtedly marks considerable progress, in\r\ncomparison to previous reports, with respect to format\r\nand content. The significant reduction in its size and\r\nthe inclusion of an analytical summary in its\r\nintroduction are positive steps that help us better to\r\nread and understand it. In preparing it, the Security\r\nCouncil responded to the demands of the great majority\r\nof Members of this Organization. These efforts of the\r\nCouncil to improve its report should be pursued and\r\nencouraged so that it may ultimately become the\r\nsubstantive and useful document that all Members\r\ndesire and need. In this respect, we highlight the work\r\nof the non-permanent members of the Council, in\r\nparticular the Permanent Representatives of Colombia\r\nand Singapore. We call on the newly elected members\r\nto continue working to that end.\r\nWe recognize that progress has been made\r\ntowards transparency in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil. Greater effort has been made to hold more\r\npublic meetings open to the participation of non-\r\nmember States. Furthermore, more wrap-up sessions\r\nhave been held at the end of each month. However, as\r\nthe report itself reveals, most substantive deliberations\r\nare held in informal consultations behind closed doors.\r\nThis lack of transparency not only affects the\r\nother Member States, but is also felt within the\r\nSecurity Council itself. We are currently witnessing the\r\nclearest example of this, as deliberations on items of\r\nsuch vital importance as international peace and\r\nsecurity are being discussed far from the Council\r\nChamber and exclusively by the permanent members,\r\nsidetracking the other members of that body and all the\r\nStates Members of the United Nations. This attitude is\r\nnot in keeping with the spirit of the times or the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. The Security\r\nCouncil acts under the Charter on behalf of the United\r\nNations and the United Nations is all of its Member\r\nStates. We must not allow the Security Council to\r\nbecome an instrument used by a group of States or to\r\nbe driven by unilateral action. Under the Charter of this\r\nOrganization, we are pledged to unrestricted\r\ncommitment to multilateral action. The events of the\r\nday mean that we must act together. Paraguay firmly\r\nbelieves in multilateralism and the legal mechanisms\r\nestablished for the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nThe adoption last year of resolution 1373 (2001)\r\ndemonstrated that the Security Council can meet new\r\nchallenges and act in a transparent manner. The\r\ncommittee established under this resolution, chaired by\r\nAmbassador Jeremy Greenstock, has been a model of\r\nopenness and transparency vis-à-vis all Member States\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nof the Organization. It has shown that for the effective\r\nimplementation of the resolution, we need the goodwill\r\nand cooperation of all Member States.\r\nMy delegation believes that in order to make the\r\nCouncil’s work and performance more effective and to\r\navoid any questioning of the legitimacy of its\r\ndecisions, its reform is something we cannot defer.\r\nThis is the goal sought — to increase the Council’s\r\nefficiency and effectiveness and to improve its working\r\nmethods.\r\nAs we pointed out at the beginning, the Security\r\nCouncil must be more democratic, representative,\r\nequitable, transparent and in keeping with the realities\r\nof the day. Its working methods must provide for and\r\nreflect greater transparency and participation; its\r\ncomposition should reflect the political realities of the\r\nday. The position of Paraguay on this has been set forth\r\nrepeatedly.\r\nIn summary, Security Council reforms should be\r\ntotal and both categories of its membership —\r\npermanent and non-permanent — should be expanded.\r\nBoth developed and developing countries should be\r\nincluded in this expansion, with special account taken\r\nof the latter as they are currently underrepresented.\r\nSimilarly, a fundamental aspect of these reforms\r\nis the question of veto. What we should seek primarily\r\nis its gradual elimination, until it disappears entirely.\r\nThis would bring about a Security Council that is truly\r\nequitable and democratic. As a first step, there should\r\nbe strict limitation of its use to questions provided for\r\nin Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nAnother aspect that we think is important to\r\nhighlight is the improvement of communication and\r\ninteraction between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and indeed other bodies of this\r\nOrganization. In this regard, we believe that it is vital\r\nfor the Council President to report to the General\r\nAssembly on priority items of current interest, or\r\nspecific situations which are the focus of attention of\r\nall Member States.\r\nI would like to conclude by repeating that no\r\nreforms of the United Nations will have the effect that\r\nwe want if the long-sought reform of the Security\r\nCouncil — the organ charged by the Charter with the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security —\r\ndoes not happen. Until it happens, we cannot talk about\r\nan Organization in keeping with the times in which we\r\nlive, nor can it respond to the interests and aspirations\r\nof the international community.\r\nMr. Pamir (Turkey): Before elaborating our\r\nviews on the two subjects before us, I wish to express\r\nour delegation’s sincere sentiments of deep sorrow over\r\nthe tragic loss of life which occurred as a result of the\r\nrecent terrorist attacks in Bali. We extend our heartfelt\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims and their\r\nGovernments. We add our voice to the Security\r\nCouncil’s condemnation of the bomb attacks, which\r\nwas adopted as resolution 1438 (2002) on 14 October.\r\nAllow me to congratulate the President and the\r\nother authors of the idea of clustering these two highly\r\nimportant agenda items into a joint debate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Indeed, the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is not limited only to the expansion of its\r\nmembership. It also includes the review of the\r\nCouncil’s method of work and its activities in general.\r\nNeedless to say, the Council’s annual report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly sheds ample light on the work of\r\nthis important organ of the United Nations.\r\nThis year, we have noted with pleasure a couple\r\nof positive developments with regard to the annual\r\nreport before us. First of all, it is considerably shorter\r\nthan previous versions; the financial and other\r\nimplications of this effort are obvious. Secondly, for\r\nthe first time ever, the report contains an introductory\r\nsection briefly outlining the work of the Council within\r\na given period. Thirdly, due to the curtailment of\r\nduplications, the report this year stands as a better-\r\nstreamlined document. These are welcome\r\ndevelopments, and we believe the momentum for the\r\nfurther improvement of the annual report, both in terms\r\nof format and content, should not only be maintained,\r\nbut must also be stepped up.\r\nOn the other hand, we are also aware of the fact\r\nthat the report itself, however detailed it could be,\r\ncannot paint a perfect picture of the intricacies of the\r\nCouncil’s activities. Within this context, we are of the\r\nopinion that the assessments provided by the Council\r\nmembers themselves are complementary in nature and\r\ncarry particular importance. Hence, we warmly\r\nwelcome the Council’s public debate on 26 September\r\n2002, just before the adoption of its annual report, as\r\nreflected in the provisional verbatim record\r\n(S/PV.4616). Moreover, the annual debate in the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the report of the Council\r\nprovides an excellent opportunity for the wider\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nmembership of the United Nations to bring forth their\r\nviews and suggestions on the Council’s work. We are\r\nhappy to see that some of the recommendations made\r\nby Member States during last year’s Assembly debate\r\nwere adopted by the Council.\r\nFinally, my delegation has also noted with\r\nsatisfaction that the Security Council has already\r\nplaced on its programme of work an interactive debate\r\non the results of the Assembly’s current consideration\r\nof its report. We sincerely hope that the annual report\r\nwill continue to improve, with a view to making it a\r\nmore informative document on the contribution of the\r\nCouncil to the maintenance of peace and security in the\r\nworld.\r\nAs to the Council’s working methods, my\r\ndelegation wishes to put on record its satisfaction at the\r\nprogress made during the period under review. The\r\nnumber of open meetings has indeed increased.\r\nMember States of the United Nations are now in a\r\nbetter position to channel their views to the Council on\r\ndivers occasions and on a variety of issues. The\r\nmechanism introduced for convening joint meetings\r\nbetween the members of the Council and the troop-\r\ncontributing countries is a welcome step forward. The\r\nCouncil’s wrap-up sessions provide an opportunity to\r\nassess its work. Nevertheless, there is still room for\r\nimprovement. Instituting a better mechanism for the\r\ninteraction of the Council with the other States and\r\nactors, particularly with those who are directly\r\ninterested in or affected by the subject in question,\r\nshould be further considered.\r\nOn the other hand, we hope that the members\r\nwould reflect upon the idea of codifying the recent\r\nchanges in the Council’s own practice, as suggested by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report entitled\r\n“Strengthening the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387). My delegation recognizes\r\nthe need of the Council members to work sometimes in\r\na non-rigid environment. Nevertheless, the fact remains\r\nas an anomaly of the system, that the Council’s rules of\r\nprocedure are still provisional after 57 years.\r\nLet me turn briefly to the question of ensuring\r\nequitable representation in the Security Council by\r\nincreasing its membership. Since the establishment of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group, Turkey, like many\r\nothers, has been an advocate of comprehensive reform\r\nthat would provide the international community with a\r\nmore effective and more representative Council.\r\nHowever, the lack of tangible progress after many\r\nyears is indeed frustrating. The year 2003 will mark the\r\ntenth anniversary of the beginning of the Group’s work.\r\nTherefore, we call upon all members to recommit\r\nthemselves to this issue with renewed dedication and\r\npolitical will. Following the changes on the global\r\nscene more than a decade ago, many international\r\norganizations adapted themselves to the new realities.\r\nThe United Nations, as the only world body, cannot fail\r\nin the task of reforming itself.\r\nLet me conclude by congratulating the newly\r\nelected members of the Security Council: Angola,\r\nChile, Germany, Pakistan and Spain. We look forward\r\nto working closely with them and with the other\r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Let me join previous\r\nspeakers in expressing our sympathies to the families\r\nof the victims — of all nationalities — of the terrorist\r\nattack that occurred in Bali over the weekend. We\r\ncondemn that attack, along with all of the other recent\r\nterrorist attacks.\r\nNorway generally views the Security Council as a\r\nwell-functioning and effective international body. Over\r\nthe past several years, the Council has increasingly\r\ndemonstrated unity and efficiency, not least when faced\r\nwith new challenges such as last year’s terrorist\r\nattacks. But if it is to maintain its role and authority in\r\nthe future, it must reflect the world of today.\r\nFirst of all, Norway would like to see a more\r\nrepresentative Security Council. Enlargement is on our\r\nagenda because we consider it necessary to ensure\r\nbetter geographical distribution and more equitable\r\nrepresentation on the Council. The time has come to\r\nstrengthen the influence of the developing countries.\r\nSecondly, Norway is of the view that the work of\r\nthe Council should be more transparent. Progress has\r\nbeen made in that respect. There are now more open\r\nmeetings, and mechanisms for consultation with non-\r\nmembers have been improved. However, work to\r\nfurther those developments should continue.\r\nOur common objective is to make the United\r\nNations a more effective multilateral instrument for\r\npursuing the priorities set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. Moreover, in that Declaration we all\r\nundertook to intensify our efforts to achieve\r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council in all its\r\naspects. Nevertheless, it has proved difficult to reach\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nconsensus among Member States on how to move\r\nforward on the question of enlargement and reform of\r\nthe Council. We are concerned that the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group has not reached a broad consensus. A\r\nstronger dose of political will is needed in order to\r\nbreak the current impasse.\r\nWe must reinforce our efforts to advance the\r\nSecurity Council reform agenda. At the end of the day,\r\nwe are faced with an issue that has a bearing on the\r\nrelevance and the credibility of the Security Council as\r\nan effective global decision-making instrument. We\r\nhope that, under the President’s able guidance, the\r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group can regain\r\nmomentum and can reach a successful conclusion. In\r\norder to move in the right direction, we must focus on\r\nways of safeguarding the Security Council’s unique\r\ncontribution to world affairs.\r\nPolitical will and determination will be needed to\r\nachieve wider and more equitable representation in the\r\nSecurity Council, in particular to ensure adequate\r\nrepresentation of the developing countries. Norway\r\nsupports an enlargement of both categories of\r\nmembership — non-permanent and permanent. Non-\r\npermanent members are a crucial element in that they\r\nensure fairer representation and accountability. They\r\ncan be expected, as a matter of self-interest, to give\r\npriority to openness and to broad consultations with\r\nnon-Council members. In addition, elected members\r\nshould constitute a majority in the Council in the\r\nfuture. The combination of non-permanent and\r\npermanent members ensures broader representation, as\r\nwell as continuity, in the work of the Council.\r\nTherefore, Norway also favours an increase in the\r\nnumber of permanent Council members.\r\nOur long-term goal is to make sure that the\r\nUnited Nations remains a vigorous, relevant and\r\ncredible multilateral Organization. As a global\r\ndecision-making forum, it should now muster the inner\r\nstrength to face up to the task of reforming the Security\r\nCouncil and thereby renewing itself.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): On behalf of the\r\nGovernment of Armenia, I want to express our deepest\r\ncondolences to the people and the Government of\r\nIndonesia, as well as to other countries whose nationals\r\nperished in the deadly terrorist bombings last Saturday\r\nin Bali.\r\nArmenia attaches great importance to reform of\r\nthe Security Council and supports the ongoing efforts\r\naimed at strengthening the Council and enabling it to\r\nreact promptly and effectively to current challenges\r\nand threats. We welcome the notable progress that has\r\nbeen made over the years in improving the Council’s\r\nworking methods. We are particularly pleased to see\r\nthe growing number of public debates, which give non-\r\nmembers an opportunity to participate in the\r\ndeliberations of that important body.\r\nWhile welcoming the increase in public meetings,\r\nwe should like to emphasize the need for more\r\ntransparency in the Security Council’s internal\r\ndecision-making procedures. We note with satisfaction\r\nthe significant improvement in the Council’s annual\r\nreport, which, with its informative and streamlined\r\nformat, gives the Assembly a valuable opportunity to\r\nreflect both on the activities and on the future of the\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe vast majority of Member States have\r\narticulated their positions vis-à-vis reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. The debates of the Millennium\r\nAssembly made it clear that most members favour an\r\nincrease in both permanent and non-permanent\r\nmembership. We also believe that real reform should\r\ninclude an expansion of both categories, in conformity\r\nwith the principle of equality among Member States, as\r\nwell as with that of equitable geographic\r\nrepresentation. If the Council is to discharge more\r\neffectively its responsibilities in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security in the new century, its capacity must\r\nbe strengthened through a series of reforms to improve\r\nits effectiveness and authority. Therefore, its\r\nmembership should evolve accordingly.\r\nWith regard to permanent membership, we are\r\nconvinced in particular that new permanent members\r\nshould be ready and able to make a major contribution,\r\nboth financial and political. In that regard, we believe\r\nthat two seats should be allocated to developed\r\ncountries in an enlarged Security Council. We also\r\nsupport the proposals to increase the regional\r\nrepresentation of the permanent membership in the\r\nCouncil — especially with regard to the regions that\r\nare currently underrepresented, such as Asia, Africa,\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. It is our strong belief\r\nthat any increase in the non-permanent membership\r\nshould ensure an enhanced presence of the Eastern\r\nEuropean States through the allocation of one\r\nadditional seat to that group, whose membership has\r\nmore than doubled in recent years.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nIn its responses to various conflicts, a reformed\r\nSecurity Council should make every possible effort to\r\ntake into account, along with political considerations,\r\nthe legal and historical aspects of those conflicts. That\r\ncould further enhance the effectiveness of the\r\nimplementation of the relevant Council resolutions.\r\nAs for the right of veto, we believe that the\r\nresolution of that issue will require the political\r\njudgement of all nations, first and foremost those\r\ncurrently enjoying that right. We think that reform is\r\nneeded to make the veto more accountable and its\r\napplication more limited. Equally, such reform should\r\nnot diminish the effectiveness and political vitality of\r\nthe Council. The present permanent members should\r\ncome up with constructive proposals so as to\r\nharmonize the stance of the majority of States on this\r\nissue.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has highlighted in his\r\nrecent report on the strengthening of the United\r\nNations, which is subtitled “An agenda for further\r\nchange”, it is essential to reach a broad agreement with\r\nrespect to the reform of the Security Council in order to\r\nsucceed with the reform of the United Nations as a\r\nwhole. The United Nations has never lacked proposals\r\nfor reform. The reason and need for reform of the\r\nSecurity Council has already been laid before us for\r\nalmost 10 years. What we need now is strong political\r\nwill. Reform of the Council is not an easy process. A\r\nCouncil capable of effectively carrying out its\r\nresponsibilities is of paramount importance to all of us.\r\nHowever, it is only through comprehensive reform that\r\nthe Council will win consensus in its necessary role as\r\ncustodian of peace and security in the world.\r\nIn conclusion, I would also like to join other\r\ndelegations in congratulating Angola, Chile, Germany,\r\nPakistan and Spain on their election to non-permanent\r\nseats in the Security Council, and to express my\r\nconfidence that those delegations will make positive\r\ncontribution to the Council’s work.\r\nMr. Al-Kidwa (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to join others in condemning\r\nthe terrorist attack that took place in Bali a few days\r\nago. I extend our condolences to the Government and\r\npeople of Indonesia and to the families of the victims.\r\nI wish to say that the Security Council has in fact\r\nmade some progress in assuming its responsibilities\r\nwith regard to the events in occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem, and with regard to\r\nthe Middle East in general. The Council has held many\r\nopen meetings to discuss the dangerous deteriorating\r\nsituation. It has also adopted four resolutions, including\r\nthe important resolution 1397 (2002), which for the\r\nfirst time confirmed the Council’s vision of two States,\r\nIsrael and Palestine, living in peace side-by-side within\r\nsecure and recognized borders. In addition, the Council\r\nadopted resolution 1435 (2002), which falls outside the\r\nperiod covered by the Council’s report to the General\r\nAssembly. Those resolutions were the result of ongoing\r\nconcrete efforts by a large number of members of the\r\nCouncil, for which we are grateful.\r\nNevertheless, there were also many serious\r\nnegative elements and developments. First of all, on 15\r\nDecember 2001, the United States of America cast its\r\ntwenty-fifth veto in connection with a resolution\r\nconcerning the situation in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories, including East Jerusalem. That same\r\npermanent member of the Council also resisted the\r\nnotion of even considering any further draft resolution\r\non the subject, regardless of the text of such a draft\r\nresolution or of the realities of the situation in the field.\r\nI would like to point out that the Council was also\r\nunable to deal with two proposals specifically\r\nintroduced by South Africa, in its capacity as the Chair\r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. Those proposals would\r\nhave invited the leaders of both sides to attend a\r\nmeeting of the Council and would have deployed a\r\nSecurity Council mission to the region.\r\nThere was also what we referred to as the great\r\nscandal, when the Council was unable to stand up to\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, in getting it to cooperate\r\nwith the Secretary-General and to implement resolution\r\n1405 (2002), regarding deploying a fact-finding team\r\nto investigate the events in the Jenin refugee camp. In\r\naddition to its rejection of all resolutions, it was also\r\nunbelievable to see an occupying Power commit war\r\ncrimes in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention\r\nand then to refuse to allow a fact-finding team of\r\neminent persons designated by the Secretary-General to\r\ninvestigate those acts. What Israel did was not in itself\r\nunbelievable, as it has behaved in the same manner\r\ntime and again. What was truly incredible was the fact\r\nthat the Council was unable to make any serious effort\r\nto counter that challenge to its mandate and to\r\ninternational law. Moreover, Israel has also failed to\r\nimplement resolution 1403 (2002), which calls for the\r\nimplementation of resolution 1402 (2002) without\r\ndelay.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.30\r\nDespite the progress made, one major problem\r\nremains. The Council has not been able to follow-up on\r\nor enforce its resolutions when it comes to Israel. Since\r\nthe beginning of Israeli occupation, in 1967, the\r\nCouncil has adopted 37 resolutions concerning the\r\nsituation in the occupied territories and the practices of\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power. Twenty-seven of those\r\nresolutions affirmed the applicability of the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention and the need for the occupying\r\nPower to abide by the Convention. Those resolutions\r\nhave dealt with many subjects, including those of\r\ndisplaced Palestinians, Jerusalem, settlements,\r\ndeportation and the protection of Palestinian civilians.\r\nCommittees were established, envoys were sent and\r\nreports were requested from the Secretary-General.\r\nNone of that produced any results whatever. Israel has\r\nnot abided by any of these resolutions and has, in fact,\r\npublicly rejected most of them. To date, Israel has not\r\nceased in its violation of the spirit and letter of those\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe Council has done nothing whatever in\r\nresponse, thereby making the provisions of the Charter,\r\nincluding Article 25, a tragic farce, and signalling\r\ndangerous consequences for the international order. I\r\nbelieve the Council must end all this. It must ensure the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions in all instances and\r\nwithout exceptions.\r\nOrganization of work\r\nThe Acting President: Tomorrow, 16 October,\r\nthe General Assembly will consider in the morning the\r\nreport of the General Committee on action taken at this\r\nmorning’s meeting as the first item. At tomorrow\r\nmorning’s meeting, the Assembly will also consider as\r\nthe third item a note by the Secretary-General\r\ncontained in document A/57/468, regarding agenda\r\nitem 41 (a), entitled “Final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in 1990s”, in order to take\r\naction on a draft decision recommended in paragraph\r\n18 of that notice. We shall continue the debate on the\r\nreport of the Security Council tomorrow morning as the\r\nfourth item.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
