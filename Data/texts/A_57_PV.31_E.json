(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Miss Clarke\r\n(Barbados), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAdoption of the agenda and organization of work:\r\nreports of the General Committee\r\nThird report of the General Committee\r\n(A/57/250/Add.2)\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw the\r\nattention of representatives to the third report of the\r\nGeneral Committee, document A/57/250/Add.2.\r\nIn paragraph 1 of the report, the General\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that\r\nconsideration of the item entitled “Question of the\r\nComorian island of Mayotte” be deferred to the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly and that the\r\nitem be included in the provisional agenda of that\r\nsession.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly approves that\r\nrecommendation?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In paragraph 2 of the\r\nreport, the General Committee recommends to the\r\nGeneral Assembly that an additional item entitled\r\n“South American Zone of Peace and Cooperation” be\r\nincluded in the agenda of the current session.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto include this additional item in the agenda of the\r\ncurrent session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Committee\r\nfurther recommends that the additional item be\r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides\r\nto consider this item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to inform\r\nMembers that the item entitled “South American Zone\r\nof Peace and Cooperation” becomes item 167.\r\nAgenda item 31\r\nElimination of unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/179 and\r\nCorr.1 and A/57/179/Add.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.4)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/57/L.4.\r\nMr. Dorda (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The draft resolution that we are submitting to\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nthe Assembly today does not pertain to Libya\r\nspecifically, but to the whole world. It is not directed at\r\nLibya specifically; indeed, it is directed at all other\r\nStates, particularly the industrialized developed nations\r\nthat are advanced technologically. Therefore, here we\r\nare not defending Libya alone; we are defending the\r\nentire international community, and the industrialized\r\ndeveloped nations in particular.\r\nWe should by no means accept that a parliament\r\nof any State can legislate for all of us. When people\r\nelect their representatives to a parliament, they elect\r\nthem so that they will represent them and legislate on\r\ntheir behalf.\r\nSuch legislation cannot and must not apply\r\nbeyond the judicial authority of those countries. We are\r\ntalking about the parliament of a country insisting that\r\nits legislation should apply to the entire world, even\r\nthough the people who elected those representatives\r\nelected them to legislate for their country only. If we\r\naccept that practice, then we can only expect further\r\nlegislation of the same kind. If we comply with such\r\nlegislation, then we must expect that there will be\r\nfurther legislation with which we have to comply.\r\nWe are not against any one State; we are trying\r\nonly to defend ourselves. Legislation of this nature not\r\nonly contravenes the principles of international law and\r\nthe Charter, but goes against all international human\r\nrights instruments. It also goes against sustainable\r\ndevelopment — a subject on which the international\r\ncommunity is holding conference after conference at\r\nthe summit level. What right does a parliament in any\r\nparticular country have to legislate to prohibit countries\r\nfrom cooperating among themselves? We do not\r\nsubscribe to the theory of laissez-faire — yet those\r\ncountries that subscribe to it are the very ones who are\r\nnot allowing us to develop. Those who preach\r\ninternational free trade are the very ones who have\r\nlegislated to prohibit international trade, cooperation,\r\nprogress and development.\r\nMy country accords priority to geographical\r\nfactors. Europe is the prime target of the legislation,\r\nand my country wishes to emphasize that it is quite\r\nsatisfied by the level of cooperation that we have with\r\nall European States in all fields, including energy,\r\nindustry, agriculture, services, trade and commerce. We\r\nare trying to redouble our efforts to promote such\r\ncooperation with neighbouring States, as well.\r\nWe are essentially defending the countries —\r\nJapan and the industrialized countries — that would be\r\ndeprived by this legislation of the revenue and income\r\nthat they would daily make in the Libyan market. We\r\nare talking not about Libya alone, but about the\r\ninternational community, about values and ideals,\r\nabout human rights and the United Nations Charter and\r\nthe principles of international law.\r\nI call on the Assembly to vote in favour of the\r\ndraft resolution so that in future we can pre-empt all\r\nthose who seek to undermine international cooperation\r\nor to impose their legislation on our peoples,\r\nparliaments and representatives.\r\nI wish members every success and call on them to\r\nvote for their own interests first and foremost, as well\r\nas for the interests of humanity.\r\nMr. Vallenilla (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China in support of draft resolution A/57/L.4,\r\nentitled “Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion”, just introduced by the\r\nAmbassador of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\r\nIn adding our support for the draft resolution, I\r\nwould like to reiterate the position of the ministers of\r\nthe developing countries, expressed in the Declaration\r\nissued on the occasion of the Twenty-Sixth Annual\r\nMinisterial Meeting of the Group of 77, held at New\r\nYork on 19 September 2002. Paragraph 42 of that\r\nDeclaration states:\r\n“We firmly reject the imposition of laws and\r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all\r\nother forms of coercive economic measures,\r\nincluding unilateral sanctions against developing\r\ncountries, and reiterate the urgent need to\r\neliminate them immediately. We emphasize that\r\nsuch actions not only undermine the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand international law, but also severely threaten\r\nthe freedom of trade and investment. We\r\ntherefore call on the international community\r\nneither to recognize these measures nor apply\r\nthem.”\r\nI would also like to recall paragraph 96 of the\r\nPlan of Implementation agreed at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development in Johannesburg, South\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nAfrica, on 4 September 2002, and endorsed by the\r\nheads of State or Government of the international\r\ncommunity, in which States agreed to\r\n“Take steps with a view to the avoidance of\r\nand refrain from any unilateral measure not in\r\naccordance with international law and the Charter\r\nof the United Nations that impedes the full\r\nachievement of economic and social development\r\nby the population of the affected countries, in\r\nparticular women and children, that hinders their\r\nwell-being and that creates obstacles to the full\r\nenjoyment of their human rights, including the\r\nright of everyone to a standard of living adequate\r\nfor their health and well-being and their right to\r\nfood, medical care and the necessary social\r\nservices. Ensure that food and medicine are not\r\nused as tools for political pressure.”\r\nI believe that these paragraphs are very pertinent\r\nto the work of the Assembly.\r\nMr. Kazemi Kamyab (Islamic Republic of Iran):\r\nIt is indeed regrettable for all of us in the international\r\ncommunity that we have to address an issue that is in\r\nitself undermining the very foundation of\r\nmultilateralism, a principle that is the cornerstone of\r\nthe functioning of the United Nations system.\r\nThe General Assembly adopted successively\r\nresolutions 51/22, 53/10 and 55/6, in which it\r\nexpressed its deep concern at the negative impact of\r\nunilaterally imposed extraterritorial coercive economic\r\nmeasures on trade, financial and economic cooperation,\r\nincluding trade and cooperation at the regional level.\r\nSuch measures simply defy common sense, as they\r\nhamper and adversely affect the free flow of trade and\r\ncapital at the regional and international levels.\r\nMember States, in adopting these resolutions,\r\nhave categorically expressed their opposition to any\r\nuse of extraterritorial coercive economic measures or\r\nlegislative enactments unilaterally imposed by any\r\nState. They have also called for the repeal of unilateral\r\nextraterritorial laws and sanctions imposed on\r\ncorporations and nationals of other States.\r\nThe promulgation and application of laws or\r\nregulations that have extraterritorial implications\r\ninfringing the sovereignty of other States and the\r\nlegitimate interests of the entities and persons under\r\ntheir jurisdiction is a clear violation of universally\r\naccepted rules and principles of international law and\r\nhas been strongly rejected on various occasions by the\r\noverwhelming majority of States. Coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion, in particular through the enactment of\r\nextraterritorial legislation, not only contravene well-\r\nrecognized provisions and principles of international\r\nlaw and of the Charter of the United Nations, but also\r\nthreaten the basic fabric of international peace, security\r\nand stability, in clear violation of the sovereign rights\r\nof States. They also impede and constrain the\r\nsettlement of disputes through the promotion of mutual\r\ndialogue, understanding and peaceful means.\r\nIn an era of rapid and unprecedented change, the\r\nworld is more than ever in need of peace, security and\r\nstability, which must be strengthened in keeping with\r\nthe collective responsibility of countries and also\r\nthrough, inter alia, respect for sovereignty, rejection of\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of other States,\r\nrefraining from compulsion and intimidation, as well as\r\nthe creation of an enabling environment for replacing\r\nconflict and unequal relations with dialogue and\r\nnegotiations.\r\nThese measures have a serious adverse impact on\r\nthe overall economic, commercial, political, social and\r\ncultural life of the targeted countries, diminishing their\r\ncapacities and exacerbating the challenges they face at\r\nthis time of globalization and its concomitant traumatic\r\ntransformations.\r\nMoreover, they are proving to have adverse\r\nimpacts on technology transfers and on investment risk\r\nassessment, thus worsening financial and monetary\r\nmanagement, weakening industrial and agricultural\r\ninfrastructures and undermining the commercial\r\npolicies of the targeted countries. Such coercive\r\nmeasures strain the actual and potential capacities of\r\ntargeted countries in the very important areas of health\r\nand education — two basic elements of every social\r\nwelfare programme. This in itself delays the\r\ndevelopment of their economic infrastructure and\r\nresults in the further exacerbation of their regional,\r\nsocial and economic outlook.\r\nThe enforcement of unilateral coercive economic\r\nmeasures has inflicted grave and irreparable losses,\r\nincluding a heavy financial and human toll, on the\r\ntargeted countries. To this effect, the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran, as one of the countries affected, reserves the\r\nright to pursue its material and moral claims and to\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nlodge complaints against Governments enacting those\r\nmeasures.\r\nAlong those same lines, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran requests the United Nations to call for the\r\nabrogation of those measures through the adoption of\r\nconcrete actions. All countries should, in a spirit of\r\nmultilateralism and of sincere observance of\r\ninternational laws and regulations, avoid resorting to\r\nand enacting such measures.\r\nFinally, I should like to conclude by expressing\r\nmy appreciation to the Secretary-General for his report\r\nunder the agenda item entitled “Elimination of\r\nunilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures\r\nas a means of political and economic compulsion”.\r\nHowever, we are of the view that his report should, in\r\naddition to presenting a compilation of the views of\r\nMember States on this issue, contain concrete\r\nproposals and recommendations as to how the United\r\nNations system could cope with this fundamental threat\r\nto its very foundation.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I have the\r\nhonour to make this statement on behalf of the Member\r\nStates of the Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\n(OIC).\r\nAllow me at the outset to draw the attention of\r\nthe Assembly to its resolution 55/6, adopted in this\r\nvery Hall, which called on the international community\r\nto take urgent, effective and rapid measures to put an\r\nend to unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has stated,\r\n“When countries work together in multilateral\r\ninstitutions — developing, respecting and when\r\nnecessary enforcing international law — they also\r\ndevelop mutual trust and more effective\r\ncooperation on other issues.” (Press release\r\nSG/SM/8447)\r\nIn this respect, I should like to reaffirm the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular those that call for the development of\r\nfriendly relations among nations and the strengthening\r\nof cooperation in resolving economic and social\r\nproblems.\r\nIn this connection, the Islamic Group would like\r\nto reiterate once again that all peoples have the right\r\nfreely to determine the political orientation they deem\r\nappropriate and the ways and means they choose in\r\norder to achieve their economic growth and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference\r\nwould like to express its deep concern over the\r\ncontinued application of unilateral extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion and their continual adverse\r\neffects on trade and on financial and economic\r\ncooperation. In this regard, we call upon all States not\r\nto recognize or apply unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures imposed by any State that are\r\ncontrary to the recognized principles and provisions of\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Islamic Group has repeatedly called on States\r\nthat impose unilateral sanctions on the States members\r\nof the OIC to desist from such practices, since they\r\ncontravene the principles of international law and the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. It has expressed solidarity with\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, my own country, Sudan, and other States that\r\nsuffer from unilateral economic sanctions.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like, on my own behalf\r\nand on behalf of the Islamic Group, to call once again\r\nfor the repeal of coercive unilateral sanctions that are\r\nused for political and economic compulsion and that\r\ndisregard the lofty and noble principles embodied in\r\nthe United Nations Charter. The Group fully supports\r\nthe draft resolution entitled “Elimination of unilateral\r\nextraterritorial coercive economic measures as a means\r\nof political economic compulsion”, submitted by the\r\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, and calls upon all States to\r\nsupport it and vote in its favour.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Cuba vigorously and unequivocally rejects\r\nany application of unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion against developing countries.\r\nCuba’s response to the Secretary-General towards the\r\npreparation of his report is quite clear and precise;\r\nunfortunately, it was not included in the main report,\r\nalthough we submitted it one month ahead of the\r\nindicated deadline. The corresponding corrigendum has\r\nbeen published.\r\nMy country voted in favour of resolution 55/6,\r\nadopted at the fifty-fifth session of the General\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nAssembly, and it will again vote in favour today of the\r\ndraft resolution that has been introduced.\r\nThe General Assembly, in many resolutions, has\r\nopposed the application of unilateral extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic measures as a flagrant violation of\r\nthe principles of international law, the United Nations\r\nCharter and the norms and principles governing\r\ninternational trade.\r\nHowever, the United States Government has\r\nignored the appeals of the international community and\r\ncontinues to apply unilateral coercive measures as\r\ninstruments of its foreign policy and national security\r\ninterests. No other country of the world has so openly\r\nand so harshly applied measures of this kind. Between\r\n1997 and 2001, the United States Government passed\r\n59 laws and executive orders authorizing unilateral\r\neconomic sanctions. Thirty countries were affected by\r\nthese new measures. Thus, the number of States\r\ntargeted by the unilateral economic sanction regimes of\r\nthat country now stands at 78, according to the “2002\r\nNew Sanctions Study” published by USA Engage.\r\nThe so-called Torricelli, Helms-Burton and\r\nD’Amato-Kennedy Acts violate the sovereignty of\r\nStates by imposing sanctions on third countries. The\r\nextraterritoriality of these laws is incompatible with the\r\nagreements of the World Trade Organization and works\r\nagainst the efforts of the international community to\r\nachieve a just, equitable, non-discriminatory and\r\ntransparent international trading system. The five-year\r\nextension of the D’Amato-Kennedy Act, imposing\r\nsanctions on foreign companies that invest in the oil\r\nsector in Iran and Libya, contravenes the most\r\nelementary principles of international law, as well as\r\nthe freedoms of trade and investment.\r\nThe application of unilateral extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion must cease.\r\nMr. Ng (Malaysia): Malaysia associates itself\r\nwith the views expressed by the representative of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference on this very\r\nimportant issue.\r\nWe also join other delegations in reiterating our\r\ngrave concern over the application of extraterritorial\r\ncoercive measures in inter-State relations. We are\r\ndismayed that, despite the recommendations adopted\r\non this issue by the General Assembly and United\r\nNations conferences, unilateral coercive measures\r\ncontinue to be promulgated and employed as State\r\npolicies and practices, with all their negative effects on\r\nthe socio-economic development of the affected\r\ncountries. The imposition of such measures\r\ncontravenes international law and is totally\r\nincompatible not only with international rules and\r\nregulations, but also with the principles of non-\r\nintervention and non-interference in the internal affairs\r\nof sovereign States.\r\nMalaysia rejects the application of such measures\r\nas tools for political or economic pressure or coercion\r\nagainst target countries for their negative and often\r\ndebilitating effects on large sectors of the population,\r\nespecially children, women, the elderly and the\r\ndisabled.\r\nFrom the statements made in this Assembly today\r\nand in the past, and the responses received by the\r\nSecretary-General pursuant to a previous resolution on\r\nthis subject, it is clear that these measures are as\r\nuniversally unpopular as they are anachronistic. In the\r\nera of globalization and liberalization, such measures\r\nrun counter to the spirit of partnership being fostered\r\nby all countries, living as we do in this global village.\r\nIn the increasingly interdependent and interconnected\r\nworld, where international trade and international\r\ncooperation, based on mutuality of interests and\r\nbenefits, play a pivotal role in relations among States,\r\nthere is really no place or justification for the\r\ncontinuation of such measures, which are a throwback\r\nto a bygone era.\r\nFrom the development perspective, unilateral\r\ncoercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration on the Right to\r\nDevelopment. As recognized by the Intergovernmental\r\nGroup of Experts on the Right to Development in its\r\nreport, these measures run counter to the principles of a\r\nnon-discriminatory and open multilateral trading\r\nsystem and hamper the development of all developing\r\ncountries.\r\nMalaysia fully subscribes to the longstanding and\r\nprincipled position of the Non-Aligned Movement that\r\nsuch measures create barriers to free or unfettered trade\r\namongst States, and calls on all States to refrain from\r\nadopting extraterritorial or unilateral measures of\r\ncoercion as a means of exerting pressure on non-\r\naligned and other developing countries.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nIn expressing its strong support for the draft\r\nresolution sponsored by the delegation of the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, Malaysia joins the call for the\r\nimmediate repeal of such unilateral extraterritorial\r\nlaws, in particular the D’Amato-Kennedy Act and the\r\nHelms-Burton Act, the main objective of which is,\r\ninter alia, to restrict the target country’s access to\r\nmarkets, capital, technology and investment in order to\r\nmaximize the intended negative impact of that policy\r\non the country or countries concerned. These measures\r\nshould be scrapped and replaced with measures that are\r\nfair and consistent with the corpus of international\r\nlaws, principles and regulations, and with a policy of\r\ndialogue and engagement in keeping with the spirit of\r\nour time.\r\nMr. Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General, on\r\nbehalf of the African Group, which my country chairs\r\nthis month, for his comprehensive report on item 31 of\r\nthe agenda entitled “Elimination of unilateral\r\nextraterritorial coercive economic measures as a means\r\nof political and economic compulsion”.\r\nToday, we live in a world that is interdependent\r\nand overlapping on the economic and political levels,\r\none characterized by globalization and short distances\r\nthat once divided peoples, as well as by\r\ninterdependency between societies and dialogue among\r\ncultures and civilizations. It is a world characterized by\r\ntransparency brought about by the scientific and\r\ntechnological advances that have allowed us to keep\r\nabreast of all the developments that occur on the\r\nplanet, even in its remotest areas. In such a world,\r\naspiring to cooperation and unity in order to bring\r\nabout progress, unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\nmeasures used as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion contradict the spirit of the new age and the\r\nprinciples of equity and justice between peoples and\r\ncountries.\r\nIn spite of the fact that the United Nations\r\nCharter allows the Organization to use economic\r\ncoercive measures only in cases that represent a threat\r\nto international peace and security, the implementation\r\nof such means by some countries unilaterally is illegal,\r\naccording to the provisions and norms of international\r\nlaw. The General Assembly has expressed its rejection\r\nof such measures on many occasions and has adopted a\r\nnumber of resolutions rejecting unilateral coercive\r\neconomic measures. These resolutions emphasize the\r\nfact that States should refrain from using\r\nextraterritorial laws which constitute a clear threat to\r\ninternational cooperation and to the fundamental\r\nprinciples on which the international financial, trade\r\nand economic systems are based.\r\nThe African countries are fully aware of their\r\nresponsibilities within a new international regime that\r\nimposes multilateralism, such as the World Trade\r\nOrganization, and that assumes the presence of a non-\r\ndiscriminatory and equitable environment among\r\nStates to enable developing countries to advance and\r\nincrease their international economic and trade\r\nactivities.\r\nBut we question how we can accomplish such\r\nobjectives, including liberalization of international\r\ntrade, in view of the contradictions arising from the\r\ncontinuation of coercive unilateral measures that target\r\nspecific countries and prevent them from opening their\r\nmarkets to the rates of growth that they aim for.\r\nAs we are guided by the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, particularly those of developing\r\nfriendly relations among States and strengthening\r\nrelations between them, the countries of the African\r\nGroup, through many forums and along with other\r\ngroups such as the Non-Aligned Movement and the\r\nGroup of 77, have rejected and condemned measures\r\nthat defy the will of the international community. We\r\nshould take action against discrimination, injustice,\r\noccupation, hatred and unilateral coercive measures;\r\ntake them out of international relations in order to have\r\na just and peaceful world.\r\nIn conclusion, the countries of the African Group\r\nare concerned about the continuation of the unilateral\r\ncoercive measures that affect the sovereignty and\r\nnational interests of countries and international trade at\r\nthe regional and international levels. Such measures\r\nnot only undermine the principles enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and in international law, but\r\nalso seriously threaten the freedom of investments and\r\ntrade, since every State has an inalienable right to\r\neconomic, social and cultural development, and the\r\nright to choose freely the political, economic and social\r\nsystem that is appropriate for the prosperity of its\r\npeople and in accordance with its national plans and\r\npolicies.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement.\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nMs. Ndhlovu (South Africa): At the Twelfth\r\nSummit of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in\r\nDurban, South Africa, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment stated, in the Durban Declaration for the\r\nNew Millennium, that:\r\n“We must take up the challenge to\r\nfundamentally transform international relations,\r\nso as to eradicate aggression, racism, the use of\r\nforce, unilateral coercive measures and unfair\r\neconomic practices, foreign occupation and\r\nxenophobia in order to achieve a world of peace,\r\njustice and dignity for all”.\r\nThe Summit also condemned certain States that\r\npersist in intensifying unilateral coercive measures and\r\nin using domestic legislation with extraterritorial\r\neffects against developing countries. These refer to\r\nactions that include blockades, embargoes and the\r\nfreezing of assets with the purpose of preventing\r\ndeveloping countries from exercising their right to\r\nfully determine their political, economic and social\r\nsystems while freely expanding their international\r\ntrade.\r\nThe heads of State and Government also\r\nreaffirmed their commitment to strongly resist and to\r\ntake a unified stand against economic coercion. The\r\nNon-Aligned Movement is convinced of the need to\r\ncontribute more effectively to increasing the role of\r\ndeveloping countries in the international economic\r\nsystem. This need was recognized by all countries at\r\nthe United Nations Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in Monterrey in March this year.\r\nFurthermore, equal and non-discriminatory rights of all\r\ncountries to join the international trading system and\r\nthe need to keep the World Trade Organization and its\r\nmembership procedures non-political and economy-\r\noriented cannot be overemphasized.\r\nOur aim is to create a rules-based system in\r\nwhich small and large nations will be treated as equal\r\nsovereign States. We believe that such a democratic\r\nreform will benefit all.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement firmly believes that\r\nrecourse by the major trading countries to actions such\r\nas extraterritorial measures are incompatible with\r\ninternational rules and with the principles of the World\r\nTrade Organization. The unjustified and excessive use\r\nof anti-dumping measures to the detriment of the trade\r\nof developing countries is also a matter of great\r\nconcern.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement, in condemning the\r\nincreased use of coercive economic measures on\r\ndeveloping countries, clearly states that no State may\r\nuse or encourage the use of political, economic or any\r\nother type of measures to coerce another State,\r\nincluding non-extension of most-favoured-nation\r\nstatus. We also reject the expansion of such trends and\r\nurge States applying unilateral coercive measures to\r\nput an immediate end to them.\r\nThe Movement is concerned about the adverse\r\neffects of the use of coercive economic measures on\r\nthe economy and development efforts of developing\r\ncountries. There is no doubt that such measures have a\r\nwide negative impact on international economic\r\ncooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards\r\na non-discriminatory and open trading system.\r\nAt the Ministerial Meeting of the Coordinating\r\nBureau of the Non-Aligned Movement in Durban in\r\nApril this year, the Ministers again recognized the\r\nrights of all States to determine freely their own\r\npolitical, economic and social systems. They thus\r\ncondemned the continued use by certain countries of\r\nextraterritorial measures and the imposition of\r\nunilateral coercive economic measures against certain\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Ministers also repeated the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement’s call on all States not to recognize\r\nunilateral, extraterritorial laws as enacted by certain\r\ncountries. They were of the view that such measures\r\nthreaten the sovereignty of States and adversely affect\r\ntheir social and economic development. Furthermore,\r\nthey marginalize developing countries with regard to\r\nthe process of globalization and are contrary to\r\ninternational law, to the principles and purposes of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, to the norms and\r\nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States,\r\nand to agreed principles of the multilateral trading\r\nsystem.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Kuwait.\r\nMr. Al-Awadi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the Group of Arab\r\nStates, which my country is chairing for the month of\r\nOctober.\r\nOver the past few years, the Arab Group has\r\nfollowed closely the discussions held in the General\r\nAssembly on the item before us today, entitled\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\n“Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion”. Those discussions have led to\r\nthe adoption of three Assembly resolutions expressing\r\nthe concern of Member States at the negative impact of\r\ncoercive measures that are imposed unilaterally and\r\nthat transcend national and regional jurisdictions. The\r\nresolutions call for the elimination of national laws that\r\ncontradict and contravene international law. More than\r\nonce, the members of the Arab Group have expressed,\r\nthrough their membership in the Arab League or in\r\nother regional organizations — particularly the Non-\r\nAligned Movement — their complete rejection of such\r\ncoercive measures, which contradict the principle of\r\nthe sovereignty of States and other international norms\r\nunder which we all operate in organizing our\r\ninternational relations.\r\nWe in the Arab Group are fully convinced of the\r\nimpact of unilateral coercive economic measures on the\r\nefforts of the United Nations to follow up on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nSecretary-General has pointed out that one of our\r\nprimary objectives for the next century is to strengthen\r\ninternational law in all areas, particularly to respect the\r\nCharter principles of the equal sovereignty of States\r\nand of non-intervention in their internal affairs. The\r\nAssembly should continue to reject such measures,\r\nwhich attempt to marginalize international law and to\r\nput national laws above its principles and norms. Such\r\nobjectives contradict those on which we agreed when\r\nwe set out priorities for facing the challenges of the\r\nnew century, which require that we strongly uphold the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter and that we\r\nensure compliance with resolutions of international\r\nlegitimacy, particularly on the part of those that ignore\r\nsuch norms. We should like to recall that the issue of\r\nunilateral extraterritorial coercive economic measures\r\nand the fact that they contravene international law are\r\nnot new.\r\nHere, I should like to point out the inadmissibility\r\nof intervention in the internal affairs of countries and\r\nthe importance of protecting the sovereignty and\r\nequality of States, which the General Assembly\r\naffirmed in 1956, as well as the Charter of Economic\r\nRights and Duties of States, adopted in 1974 by the\r\nGeneral Assembly in resolution 3281 (XXIX), which\r\nstates that no country may use or encourage the use of\r\neconomic, political or any other type of measures to\r\ncoerce another State in order to obtain from it the\r\nsubordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.\r\nThat is the essence of the three resolutions adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly under this item and the objective\r\nof the draft resolution that we shall consider for\r\nadoption at the end of today’s debate.\r\nThe extent to which such unilateral coercive\r\nmeasures contravene the principles of international\r\nlaw — not to speak of the obvious negative economic\r\nand social effects of their implementation, which we\r\nhave no time to consider at the moment because of our\r\nconvention and because they are well known to\r\neveryone — should be enough to convince the\r\ninternational community to continue to reject them.\r\nTherefore, the Arab Group calls upon all members to\r\njoin us in supporting the draft resolution before us\r\ntoday for consideration, sponsored by the\r\nrepresentative of Libya. That draft resolution is in\r\nconformity with the firm international position that\r\nrejects unilateral economic measures and supports\r\nStates in rejecting such measures, which lack\r\ninternational legitimacy.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Wehbe (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Enhancing international cooperation to resolve\r\nproblems of an economic and social nature constitutes\r\none of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. For that reason, the international\r\ncommunity must fully assume its responsibilities in\r\ndealing with unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures used as a means of political and\r\neconomic compulsion.\r\nGlobalization means that we must face great\r\nchallenges. In order to do that, we must work together\r\nto prevent the consolidation of the negative measures\r\nused by certain parties to impose economic and social\r\nconditions on other States — particularly developing\r\ncountries and all those maintaining economic relations\r\nwith them — in flagrant violation of the simplest rules\r\nof international law and of the purposes and principles\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAll peoples have the right to self-determination.\r\nOn the basis of that right, which is guaranteed by the\r\nCharter, peoples are free to determine their own\r\npolitical reality and to work for the development of\r\ntheir economic, social and cultural systems. The\r\nsovereign right of States has been confirmed, for\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nexample, in the Charter of the United Nations and the\r\nCharter of Economic Rights and Duties of States,\r\nadopted in 1974 by the General Assembly in resolution\r\n3281 (XXIX). Article 32 of that document states: “No\r\nState may use or encourage the use of economic,\r\npolitical or any other type of measures to coerce\r\nanother State in order to obtain from it the\r\nsubordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights”. A\r\nnation’s imposition of its national laws on the nationals\r\nor companies of third countries in such a way as to\r\nexceed its territorial limits is a further violation of the\r\nsovereign rights of States.\r\nUnilateral, extraterritorial coercive economic\r\nmeasures are not just a violation of the principles of\r\ninternational law and the standards, goals and norms\r\ngoverning international trade and World Trade\r\nOrganization agreements, they also have negative\r\nconsequences on the social and human development of\r\ndeveloping countries victimized by such measures. The\r\nCommission on Human Rights has repeatedly\r\nconfirmed this fact. Likewise, at the XII Summit of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, held at Durban, South Africa,\r\nheads of State and Government condemned the\r\npersistence of some States in intensifying such\r\neconomic measures unilaterally and to adopt national\r\nlegislation having extraterritorial effect in order to\r\nprevent developing countries from exercising their full\r\nright to determine their own political, economic and\r\nsocial systems and to freely expand their international\r\ntrade. The Non-Aligned Movement reaffirmed that\r\nposition once again at the ministerial meeting of its\r\nCoordinating Bureau held in Durban in 2002, at which\r\ntime the Movement also reaffirmed its repudiation of\r\nnational laws that exceed the territorial limits of States\r\nas contrary to the very nature of international relations\r\nand the purposes and principles of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nSimilarly, at the South Summit, held in Havana,\r\nthe heads of State and Government of the Group of 77\r\nand China reaffirmed their categorical rejection of the\r\nimposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial\r\neffect, as well as all forms of coercive economic\r\nmeasures. They also stressed that such measures not\r\nonly run counter to the principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and in international law,\r\nbut pose a serious threat to freedom of trade and\r\ninvestment. In that regard, they appealed to the\r\ninternational community not to recognize such\r\nmeasures or to apply them, as those measures were\r\ntantamount to defiance of investors, developing\r\ncountries, countries of the Non-Aligned Movement and\r\nthe Group of 77, as well as being contrary to the\r\nprinciples of morality and law and representing utter\r\ndefiance for the Charter.\r\nThe international community is increasingly\r\naware of the dangers and negative effects posed by\r\nthese unilateral economic measures as these measures\r\nhave not been confined to target countries. Their\r\nconsequences also affect every country and company\r\nthat maintains relations with those States. We believe\r\nthat the international community should take a clear\r\nand firm position in dealing with these measures. It\r\nshould also take a bolder and more courageous stance\r\nto meet the challenge posed by coercive measures, as\r\nthey represent a violation of the rules of international\r\nlaw and of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe considerable increase in the number of\r\ncountries voting in favour of the resolution on this\r\nsubject at the fifty-fifth session is evidence of the\r\ninternational community’s growing awareness of the\r\nneed to confront this challenge to international law. We\r\nhope that this trend will continue as we adopt the draft\r\nresolution before the Assembly. We are convinced that\r\nall the statements made today on behalf of the\r\ncountries of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of\r\n77, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the\r\nArab Group — with which we associate ourselves —\r\nshould help foster the growing trend in opposition to\r\nthe practice of adopting unilateral measures to impose\r\nsanctions on third countries, particularly on the Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, the Sudan, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran, Cuba and the other States throughout the world\r\nthat have been targets of coercive measures.\r\nMr. Salman (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I have the pleasure to express my gratitude to\r\nthe delegation of the brotherly Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\r\nfor its initiative to include this important item on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly, given the increased\r\ntendency to resort to coercive economic measures as a\r\nmeans of political and economic compulsion, and the\r\nheightened tensions in international political and\r\neconomic relations that are endangering international\r\npeace.\r\nArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nstipulates that one of the purposes of the United\r\nNations is to develop friendly relations among nations\r\nbased on respect for the principle of equal rights and\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nself-determination of peoples. The Charter has also\r\nentrusted the General Assembly with several major\r\ntasks, including developing international cooperation in\r\nthe cultural, social, economic, educational and medical\r\nfields and promoting respect for the human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms of all peoples. It is on the basis\r\nof that responsibility that the General Assembly is\r\ncalled upon to consider any measures taken in\r\ncontravention of those principles and to examine ways\r\nof responding to them.\r\nPractical experience has demonstrated that\r\ncoercive economic measures is a loathsome weapon\r\nthat cannot deter peoples from attaining their\r\ninalienable right to chose their own political, economic\r\nand social systems. This weapon has shown its\r\neffectiveness in injuring innocent civilians, delaying\r\ndevelopment in targeted countries and their trading\r\npartners, sowing the seeds of economic and political\r\ninstability throughout the world, and flouting the\r\nCharter, international humanitarian law, human rights,\r\nand the principles of the sovereign equality of States,\r\nterritorial integrity and non-intervention in the internal\r\naffairs of other States. It has also been effective in\r\nsuppressing the right of peoples to choose their own\r\npolitical and economic regimes and their right to\r\ndevelopment and participation in international\r\neconomic relations based on mutually beneficial\r\ncommon interests.\r\nThe imposition of coercive economic measures\r\nby individual countries through unilateral laws or\r\nthrough multilateral forums is a short-sighted policy\r\nthat leads nowhere. We would like to draw attention to\r\nthe fact that countries that resort to unilateral coercive\r\neconomic measures as a means of economic and\r\npolitical compulsion always attempt to lend the\r\nappearance of legitimacy to those measures by\r\ntransforming them into multilateral measures. That has\r\noccurred in the cases of Libya, Sudan, Iraq, Cuba and\r\nIran with the imposition of multilateral sanctions\r\nregimes against those countries.\r\nThe world today is undergoing rapid changes\r\nthrough the efforts of the international community, as\r\nrepresented by the majority of Members of this\r\ninternational Organization, to establish the rule of law\r\nand to build a world of justice, prosperity and equal\r\nrights for all. On the other hand, there are the few who\r\nare motivated by the arrogance of force and dominion,\r\nwho consider themselves above the law and who will\r\nuse any means to serve their own interests. The\r\nmajority must call on the few to warn them of the error\r\nof their ways. The draft resolution before the General\r\nAssembly today, introduced by fraternal Libya, is an\r\nattempt in that direction.\r\nCoercive economic measures imposed against\r\nIraq have led to the destruction of its economic\r\ninfrastructure and to a humanitarian disaster in which\r\nmore than 1,700,000 citizens have died. It is one of the\r\nworst disasters of modern history. That has been\r\nconfirmed by reports of United Nations agencies and\r\ninternational humanitarian organizations. The unilateral\r\ncoercive economic measures that the United States and\r\nthe United Kingdom insist on imposing actually\r\nrepresent a political conflict with Iraq, not the\r\nimplementation of United Nations resolutions.\r\nIn conclusion, we must point out that unilateral\r\ncoercive measures have made it impossible for Iraq to\r\npay its share to the international Organization and have\r\ncaused it to lose its right to vote. If Iraq had the right to\r\nvote, it would vote in favour of the draft resolution\r\nentitled “Elimination of unilateral extraterritorial\r\ncoercive economic measures as a means of political\r\nand economic compulsion”, contained in document\r\nA/57/L.4.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with the\r\ndecision taken at the 27th plenary meeting, on 14\r\nOctober 2002, I call on the Observer of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Martino (Holy See): The discussion\r\non unilateral extraterritorial coercive measures has\r\ncontinued for too many years. The Assembly has\r\nbefore it the report of the Secretary-General (A/57/179\r\nand Add.1 and Corr.1), which once again provides the\r\nresponses of States concerning that important issue.\r\nIn 1997, in preparation for the report of the\r\nSecretary-General to the fifty-second session, the Holy\r\nSee made its contribution, and my delegation believes\r\nthat this is an appropriate opportunity to once again\r\nbring that response to the attention of the Assembly:\r\n“The Holy See, because of its particular\r\nnature, does not have economic and trade\r\nrelations with other States. However, by means of\r\nthe articulation of its clear and principled stand\r\non the question of the imposition of international\r\neconomic sanctions and other means of political\r\nand economic coercion, especially by His\r\nHoliness Pope John Paul II, as well as through its\r\ndiplomatic activity in this area, it has sought to\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nalleviate the distress suffered by civilian\r\npopulations that are either directly or indirectly\r\naffected by the imposition of such measures. The\r\nHoly See considers it to be legitimate for the\r\ninternational community to resort to economic\r\nsanctions when confronted with a specific\r\nGovernment that has acted in a manner that\r\nplaces world peace in danger. However, the Holy\r\nSee holds that there are several conditions that\r\nmust accompany the imposition of such\r\nsanctions, namely, sanctions may not be a means\r\nof warfare or punishment of a people; sanctions\r\nshould be a temporary means of exerting pressure\r\non Governments whose choices threaten\r\ninternational peace; sanctions must be\r\nproportionate to the goals they hope to achieve;\r\nand sanctions must always be accompanied by a\r\ndialogue between the parties involved.\r\n“His Holiness Pope John Paul II has stated\r\nthat the embargo, clearly defined by law, is an\r\ninstrument that needs to be used with great\r\ndiscernment and it must be subjected to strict\r\nlegal and ethical criteria. It is always imperative\r\nto foresee the humanitarian consequences of\r\nsanctions, without failing to respect the just\r\nproportion that such measures should have in\r\nrelation to the very evil that they are meant to\r\nremedy. … A mechanism should be introduced\r\nthat would allow for independent and effective\r\ncontrol of the humanitarian consequences of\r\nsanctions and subsequently establish ways to\r\ncorrect those effects. The legitimate decision by\r\nthe international community never dispenses with\r\nthe due attention that must be paid to the concrete\r\nfate of the civilian population.” (A/52/459, paras.\r\n29 and 30)\r\nThe position of the Holy See has not changed,\r\nand it aligns itself with those other States that continue\r\nto call for the end of unjust and harmful measures\r\ndirected at States, not only on the basis of national\r\nsovereignty, relations to trade or economic matters, but\r\nmost especially on the basis of the recognition of\r\nhuman dignity and the right to life, liberty and security.\r\nEven as the discussion continues, the Holy See\r\nwill renew its commitment, and it joins with other\r\nGovernments, in pledging to ensure that food and\r\nmedicine are never used as tools of political pressure.\r\nBy the very phrase “coercive economic measures\r\nas a means of political and economic compulsion”, a\r\ndark shadow is cast over any result that one State might\r\nhope to accomplish. There is something almost sinister\r\nat work when force, coercion and compulsion are at\r\nwork as a means to an end. That is not the way of a\r\ncivilized world, it cannot be acceptable within the\r\nfamily of nations and it should never be condoned,\r\nunder any circumstances.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.4. Before giving the floor to the speaker in\r\nexplanation of vote before the vote, may I remind\r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10\r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseat.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Denmark,\r\nwho will speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nMr. Christensen (Denmark): I have the honour\r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union. The Central\r\nand Eastern European countries associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Association country member of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area, Liechtenstein, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nWe wish to refer to our statement made on the\r\nadoption of resolution 55/6 on 26 October 2000.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/57/L.4.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh,\r\nBelarus, Belgium, Benin, Bolivia, Botswana,\r\nBrazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina\r\nFaso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Chile,\r\nChina, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia,\r\nCuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nof the Congo, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Egypt, Eritrea, Estonia, Fiji,\r\nFinland, France, Gambia, Georgia, Germany,\r\nGhana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana,\r\nHungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic\r\nRepublic of), Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan,\r\nJordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, Lebanon, Lesotho, Libyan\r\nArab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania,\r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia,\r\nMaldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius,\r\nMexico, Monaco, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia,\r\nNepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria,\r\nNorway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay,\r\nPeru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar,\r\nRepublic of Korea, Republic of Moldova,\r\nRomania, Russian Federation, Saint Lucia,\r\nSamoa, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal,\r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan,\r\nSweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nThailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine,\r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of\r\nTanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen,\r\nYugoslavia, Zimbabwe.\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, United States of America.\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAustralia, Latvia.\r\nResolution 57/5 was adopted by 133 votes to 2,\r\nwith 2 abstentions.\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of Bhutan, Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon, Mongolia, Sao Tome\r\nand Principe and Togo informed the Secretariat\r\nthat they had intended to vote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the floor to\r\nthe speakers in explanation of vote after the vote, may I\r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seat.\r\nMs. Costa (United States): The United States\r\nopposes this resolution. It serves as a direct challenge\r\nto the prerogative of sovereign States to conduct freely\r\ntheir commercial relations. Member States should\r\nunderstand, moreover, that this resolution is aimed at\r\nundermining the international community’s ability to\r\nrespond effectively to acts that, by their very nature\r\nand enormity, are offensive to international norms.\r\nThere must be a consequence for such actions.\r\nOtherwise, offending States will have no incentive or\r\nreason to abandon them.\r\nUnilateral and multilateral economic sanctions\r\ncan be an effective means to achieve legitimate foreign\r\npolicy objectives. They constitute an influential\r\ndiplomatic tool. The United States is not alone in\r\nholding this view or in following this practice. The\r\nCharter itself provides for use of sanctions to change\r\nthe behaviour of those who would challenge or seek to\r\nundermine international norms. It should be\r\nremembered that not too long ago, the unilateral and\r\nmultilateral economic sanctions imposed on the racist\r\nregimes in South Africa and the then-Rhodesia\r\nunderscored the international community’s solidarity\r\nwith the people of those countries, who were fighting\r\nfor their dignity and freedom.\r\nThe United States resolve was not merely\r\nsymbolic. It was real, and it took the form of carefully\r\ncrafted economic decisions that spanned many years;\r\nand they had results. Those concrete measures,\r\nexpressed in our national laws, had the broad support\r\nof the American people. Through those steps, positive\r\nchange was realized. Those results-oriented actions\r\nwere appropriate then and remain so today. The United\r\nStates continues to believe that States should act with\r\nthe highest of standards, not the lowest, thereby\r\nobviating the need for such measures.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Canada.\r\nMs. Price (Canada): After careful and lengthy\r\nconsideration, Canada has decided to support the\r\nresolution just adopted as, in our view, it embodies\r\nimportant principles on the issue of extraterritorial\r\napplication of national law. Nevertheless, we consider\r\nthat the resolution could still benefit from clarifications\r\nto make it fully consistent with the relevant principles\r\nof international law. We sought to propose amendments\r\nthat would have clarified the meaning of the text. We\r\nare disappointed that the sponsoring delegation chose\r\nnot to respond.\r\nCanada has, for many years, taken a firm position\r\non the issues addressed in the resolution and has\r\nconsistently voted in support of other General\r\nAssembly resolutions condemning the inappropriate\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nextraterritorial reach of national laws. Canadian\r\nsanctions legislation does not allow for the adoption of\r\nsuch measures, as that would be inconsistent with\r\nCanadian policy and international law. Canada can and\r\ndoes exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction unilaterally.\r\nSuch exercise is generally based on the objective\r\nnationality principle. Accordingly, Canada does not\r\nobject to the assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction per\r\nse, but opposes conflicts created by such assertions of\r\njurisdiction. More specifically, Canada opposes\r\nextraterritorial measures that contradict or undermine\r\nthe laws or clearly enunciated policies of another State\r\nexercising concurrent jurisdiction on a territorial basis\r\nover the same conduct.\r\nWith respect to the resolution just adopted,\r\nCanada understands that the inclusion of the term\r\n“coercive”, notably in operative paragraph 4, is\r\nintended to ensure that the scope of the resolution is\r\nmeant to apply to the State that is the subject of the\r\nsanctions or to affected third States and their nationals\r\nand corporations.\r\nCanada’s understanding is that the inclusion of\r\nthe word “coercive” is not intended to condemn\r\nunilateral prescriptive measures that apply the\r\nobjective nationality principle. On this basis, my\r\ndelegation has supported the resolution.\r\nMr. OBrien (Australia): Australia continues to\r\noppose the application of extraterritorial unilateral\r\neconomic coercive measures that affect third countries\r\nand, therefore, we support the central tenets of this\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nHowever, under certain extreme circumstances, it\r\nmay be appropriate for States to take appropriate\r\nmeasures aimed at encouraging other Governments to\r\ncease violating their citizens’ human rights and\r\nignoring the rule of law.\r\nIn light of these concerns, Australia abstained in\r\nthe vote on this resolution.\r\nMr. Sahakov (Armenia): My delegation has just\r\nvoted in favour of the resolution entitled “Elimination\r\nof unilateral extraterritorial coercive economic\r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic\r\ncompulsion”.\r\nArmenia condemns the continuing practice of\r\nunilateral coercive economic measures, particularly in\r\nthe South Caucasus region. Such measures contradict\r\nthe basic measures and norms of international law and\r\nthe United Nations Charter, as well as the norms and\r\nregulations of the multilateral trading system. The\r\nimposition of such restrictive economic measures has a\r\ndetrimental impact on developing and transitional\r\ncountries, as in the case of landlocked Armenia, which,\r\nin addition to a geographical impediment, is suffering\r\nfrom a continuing blockade.\r\nIn this regard, the right of all States to economic,\r\npolitical, social and cultural development should be\r\nrespected, and any violation of the principles of\r\nequality should be opposed and strongly condemned.\r\nAn overall condemnation of unilateral economic\r\ncoercion will have a positive impact on the\r\ncomplicated situation in our region.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly\r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 31?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 41 (a) (continued)\r\nFinal review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s\r\n(a) Note by the Secretary-General (A/57/468)\r\n(b) Draft decision (A/57/468, para. 18)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on the draft decision entitled “One\r\nadditional meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee of the\r\nWhole of the General Assembly for the Final Review\r\nand Appraisal of the Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s”, recommended in paragraph 18 of document\r\nA/57/468.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\nthe draft decision?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item\r\n41.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nAgenda item 11 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/57/2 and Corr.1)\r\nAgenda item 40 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and increase\r\nin the membership of the Security Council and\r\nrelated matters\r\nReport of the Open-ended Working Group\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nAt the outset, I would like to join my colleagues who\r\nhave previously addressed the Assembly by expressing\r\nmy delegation’s heartfelt condolences and sympathies\r\nto Indonesia and all the countries that have lost their\r\nnationals in the tragic attack that occurred in Bali.\r\nWe have had occasion to state that terrorists\r\nrespect no religion. In fact, they use religion as a\r\npretext for their dastardly and cowardly acts. Tanzania\r\nexperienced such attacks, along with Kenya, in 1998.\r\nMy delegation supports the condemnation by the\r\nSecurity Council contained in resolution 1438 (2002).\r\nThe Assembly has before it a report of the\r\nSecurity Council, the consideration of which\r\nconstitutes an important step towards a meaningful and\r\nsustained interaction between the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council. My delegation welcomes the\r\nimproved format of the Council’s report that makes it\r\nmore user-friendly and informative. The periodic wrap-\r\nup sessions that have recently involved participation of\r\nnon-Security Council Members have added value to the\r\nworking methods of the Council. Nevertheless, a lot\r\nmore is required in ensuring greater transparency to\r\nfurther improve cooperation between the Council and\r\nthe larger membership of the General Assembly. I\r\nwould also like to echo the many interventions that\r\nhave urged the Security Council to be more analytical\r\nin its reporting to the General Assembly.\r\nIt is almost 10 years since the establishment of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Related\r\nMatters. The Secretary-General gave a very apt\r\ndescription of the problem:\r\n“In the eyes of much of the world, the size and\r\ncomposition of the Security Council appear\r\ninsufficiently representative. The perceived\r\nshortcomings in the Council’s credibility\r\ncontribute to a slow but steady erosion of its\r\nauthority, which in turn has grave implications for\r\ninternational peace and security”. (A/57/387,\r\npara. 20)\r\nRegrettably, the Working Group is nowhere closer\r\nto tying the knot on an agreement for either the reform\r\nor expansion of the Security Council. We are hopeful\r\nthat the rededication of our leaders to this noble\r\nundertaking, as set out in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nwould add momentum to the search for consensus in\r\nthis important matter. The leaders agreed “to intensify\r\n[their] efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects” (resolution 55/2,\r\npara. 30).\r\nWhile there is a convergence of views on a\r\nnumber of issues, especially on working methods,\r\nimportant differences still exist on many matters. We\r\nbelieve that, with the requisite political will and\r\ncommitment, the remaining issues could be resolved\r\nwith a sense of urgency in the interest of enhancing the\r\nefficiency and legitimacy of the Security Council.\r\nIndeed, the world has changed. The rhetoric of\r\nour Organization has evolved to respond to those\r\nchanges. The Security Council cannot afford to be seen\r\nas an anachronistic institution. The challenge,\r\ntherefore, is to reinvigorate the work we have\r\nembarked upon and commit ourselves to its timely\r\nconclusion to avoid its being termed an exercise in\r\nfutility.\r\nThe issue here, as the agenda item enjoins us, is\r\nthe task of bringing about greater democratization in\r\nthe work of the Council by enhancing the balance of\r\nrepresentation in both categories of its membership. I\r\nwould like to reiterate our long-held position that\r\nreforming the Security Council will not only increase\r\nits legitimacy, but will also reflect the present reality in\r\ninternational relations and the increase in the\r\nmembership of the Organization. I need hardly state\r\nthat the present composition of the Council is at\r\nvariance with the global constituency of the\r\nOrganization. Some of the strains that manifest\r\nthemselves from time to time are indicative of\r\nstructural and institutional problems.\r\nAfrica is the region with the largest number of\r\nMember States. During the past few years, the Security\r\nCouncil has devoted more than half of its time to issues\r\npertaining to Africa, in particular issues related to\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nconflict resolution and peace-building. And yet Africa\r\nis not represented in the permanent category of\r\nmembership of the Council entrusted with the\r\noverarching responsibility of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Africa’s demands for\r\nreform of the Council are legitimate since they\r\ndemonstrate the urgent need to bring about greater\r\ndemocratization and balance of representation. We see\r\nin the expansion of the Council a process of justice and\r\ngreater empowerment of the international community\r\nin its deliberations.\r\nThe Working Group has had on the table the\r\nproposals of the then Organization of African Unity,\r\nnow the African Union, and of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement. The proposals offered a range of\r\nrepresentation that would not compromise the\r\nefficiency of the Council. In all, Africa demands two\r\nseats in the permanent category and five elected seats.\r\nTanzania fully supports that position.\r\nQuestions have been asked with regard to the\r\nmodality of securing African membership for\r\npermanent seats. Our response, which Tanzania fully\r\nsupports, is to have a system of rotation, with which\r\nAfrica is well familiar. The two seats, but not their\r\noccupancy, will be assigned to the region — Africa —\r\non a permanent basis.\r\nWe consider the issues of the veto and expansion\r\nof membership as integral parts of a common reform\r\npackage. We call for the extension of the same rights\r\nand privileges to new members that will join the\r\nCouncil. We wish to further suggest that the exercise of\r\nveto in the expanded Council should be restricted to\r\nonly those issues or matters considered critical by the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn other words, the use of the veto or resort to\r\nCouncil action should not be an extension of the purely\r\nnarrow national interests of any Member State. To\r\ncontinue with the current practice would undermine the\r\nspirit of multilateralism as embodied in the Charter, as\r\nwell as global partnership in confronting today’s\r\nchallenges of peace and sustainable development. It is\r\nour hope that this issue will be given consideration so\r\nthat a final resolution can be arrived at without further\r\ndelay.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to state that, despite\r\nthe Working Group’s dismal progress, or lack of it, on\r\nexpansion, my delegation believes that it still has a\r\nduty to carry its mandate to fruition. We see the issues\r\nthat still divide us as surmountable if we generate the\r\nrequisite political will and commitment. We should see\r\nto it that the open-endedness of the Working Group\r\ndoes not mean its work can continue indefinitely. There\r\nhas to be finality to the Working Group’s mandate, with\r\nconcrete results, if the Group is to avoid becoming\r\nirrelevant or obsolete. That is the challenge both the\r\nAssembly and its Working Group face. There must be\r\nclosure. Otherwise, it will not be possible to generate\r\nenthusiasm. The danger, as I see it, is that lack of\r\nprogress in the realm of expansion might kill the spirit\r\nbehind the Working Group. The stakes are high. We\r\nhave to come up with resolute action. I believe it is\r\ndoable.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar) (spoke\r\nin French): I wish, at the outset, to thank the President\r\nof the Security Council for the month of October,\r\nAmbassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Cameroon, for introducing the report\r\nof the Security Council covering the period of 16 June\r\n2001 to 31 July 2002 (A/57/2). In the light of the tragic\r\nevents that occurred during that period, Madagascar\r\npays tribute to the efforts of the Security Council in\r\nachieving its mandate, particularly in the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism, which has once again claimed\r\ninnocent lives.\r\nMadagascar takes this opportunity to express its\r\nheartfelt condolences to Indonesia and to the other\r\ncountries that lost citizens during the terrorist attacks\r\nrecently carried out in Bali.\r\nAs the pivotal organ for maintaining international\r\npeace and security, the Security Council is more than\r\never called on to meet the expectations of the\r\ninternational community, not only in preventing all\r\nthreats to international peace, but also in finding urgent\r\nand effective solutions to conflict situations. That\r\nconcern for effectiveness led the General Assembly,\r\nthrough its resolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993, to set\r\nup the Open-ended Working Group on the Question of\r\nEquitable Representation on and Increase in the\r\nMembership of the Security Council and Other Matters\r\nRelated to the Security Council.\r\nThe many debates devoted to that issue both in\r\nthe Working Group and during the current session of\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nthe General Assembly show that Security Council\r\nreform is probably among the most difficult and\r\ndelicate tasks before us. We have worked for nine years\r\nto make progress in that process, without significant\r\nresults, particularly on matters related to the very core\r\nof Security Council functioning.\r\nThe appeal made by our leaders during the\r\nMillennium Summit, that we intensify our efforts to\r\nreform the procedures of the Security Council in all\r\ntheir aspects, has fallen on deaf ears in many respects.\r\nWe must acknowledge that, despite certain\r\nimprovements in the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, the prospects for a comprehensive reform to\r\nmake it a democratic, transparent and more\r\nrepresentative body are still a distant objective. Many\r\ndisagreements remain, particularly those related to the\r\ncomposition of the future Council, the expansion of the\r\ntwo categories of membership and the use of the veto.\r\nIn that regard, Madagascar would like again to\r\nemphasize the sound foundation for Africa’s claim to at\r\nleast two permanent seats, with the appropriate\r\nprerogatives, and two additional non-permanent seats,\r\nwithin an expanded 26-member Council.\r\nMy delegation does not believe that claim to be\r\nunrealistic or over-ambitious; rather, it is justified by\r\nthe logic of current realities. It is also in keeping with\r\nthe spirit and principle of the sovereign equality of all\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations. Since the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is a\r\ncollective responsibility for all — large and small, rich\r\nand poor — scrupulous respect for that principle is\r\nessential if the Council is to gain the trust and\r\ncredibility necessary for the implementation of its\r\nresolutions.\r\nIn that context, we would like to emphasize that\r\nthe non-permanent members of the Council are elected\r\nby the General Assembly and thus deserve to be\r\nassociated with any decision-making process in the\r\nCouncil and to participate fully in it. Everyone knows\r\nthat discriminatory treatment in itself constitutes a\r\nthreat to peace and security. Given the mandate\r\nconferred on it in this area, the Security Council should\r\nbe the first to avoid such practices and to promote\r\ntransparency in the interests of more effective\r\ncooperation among its members.\r\nAlso in that context, Madagascar believes that the\r\nveto is an anachronism whose use is incompatible with\r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of States. At this\r\ntime, when dialogue and democratic principles are\r\nbeing championed, the veto is an archaic and outmoded\r\ntool. Since the veto cannot be eliminated at this time,\r\nthe permanent members must act responsibility in\r\nexercising that prerogative. In that spirit, the first\r\nrealistic step might be for the permanent members to\r\nvoluntarily limit its use to situations provided for under\r\nChapter VII of the Charter. In order to better\r\ndemonstrate their responsibility in this context,\r\nexplanations should also be provided when the veto is\r\nused. Such a gesture would also confer greater\r\ncredibility on the permanent members and thus on the\r\nSecurity Council as a whole.\r\nGiven the current gloomy context of uncertainty\r\nand threat, Security Council reform is crucial to\r\nenabling that body to efficiently carry out the mandate\r\nentrusted to it in the field of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. This is, of course, a\r\ndifficult exercise, but success will be possible if we\r\nshow determination in carrying out the task that we\r\nhave been working at for so many years. Instead of\r\nsuccumbing to discouragement and resignation, we\r\nshould be encouraged by the past nine years of very\r\ndifficult work to make headway so that efforts in the\r\nWorking Group in its tenth year might bear fruit. We\r\nowe that to ourselves and to future generations.\r\nMr. Kasemsarn (Thailand): I should like at the\r\noutset, on behalf of the Royal Thai Government, to\r\nexpress our heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Indonesia, to other\r\nGovernments and, in particular, to the families of the\r\ninnocent victims who lost their lives in the tragic\r\nbombings in Bali.\r\nWith regard to the subject matter of today’s\r\ndebate, Thailand is pleased that this year two related\r\nissues — the report of the Security Council and the\r\nreport of the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council — are being\r\ntaken up jointly. This is certainly a more efficient and\r\npractical approach to dealing with the issue of Council\r\nreform, since we will be able simultaneously to\r\nevaluate and assess both the substantive aspects of the\r\nwork of the Council and its working methods.\r\nThailand welcomes the format of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council (A/57/2) as presented to us this year.\r\nThe new approach taken in the preparation of the report\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nis a reflection of the continuing progress in one aspect\r\nof Security Council reform, namely, the Council’s\r\nworking methods. The inclusion of a more substantive\r\nintroductory section appears to be quite useful, as it\r\nsheds light on how the Council views its own work.\r\nThe substantially reduced size of the report makes the\r\ndocument more user-friendly. In this connection, I\r\nshould like to acknowledge the contributions made by\r\nSingapore in spearheading the reformatting of the\r\nCouncil’s report and by the United Kingdom for\r\ndrafting the useful introductory section.\r\nIn this regard, we consider that there is room for\r\nfurther improvement in the format of the report. One\r\nimportant area is in the analytical evaluation of the\r\nperformance of the Security Council. This is a key\r\ncomponent for bringing about good governance,\r\ntransparency and accountability, and will go a long way\r\nto help address the strengths and weaknesses of the\r\nSecurity Council as the most important multinational\r\ninstitution in maintaining peace and security. We hope\r\nthat a process of self-evaluation or review will soon\r\nbecome a constant feature in the work of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nAnother area to which more attention should be\r\ngiven is that of the thematic issues discussed by the\r\nCouncil, and particularly their impact on the decisions\r\nand work of the Council. A third area of improvement\r\nconcerns the monthly assessments of the Council’s\r\nwork made by Council Presidents. Those assessments\r\nhave been quite useful in providing some insight into\r\nthe work of the Council, and should be incorporated\r\ninto the report. Finally, we would like to see the period\r\ncovered by the report extended at least to the month of\r\nAugust. We recognize that time constraints are\r\ninvolved, but such an extension would ensure that the\r\nreport was more up to date, thus facilitating the\r\nAssembly’s assessment of it.\r\nTime limitations make it impossible for us to\r\nbecome involved in an in-depth discussion of the\r\nCouncil’s work during the past year. I should therefore\r\nlike to focus on three points: political will,\r\ncoordination with other institutions and transparency.\r\nIt has been shown that when there is political\r\nwill, the Council can act decisively and get things done\r\nquickly. United Nations success stories over the past\r\nyear in Timor-Leste, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, for\r\nexample, are by-products of the committed efforts of\r\nthe peoples and leaders of the countries involved, the\r\neffective role played by key United Nations\r\nrepresentatives and the strong political will of the\r\nCouncil to see the tasks through. Effective action by\r\nthe Council at the right time was critical in those three\r\ncases. This sustained political will by the Council,\r\nbacked by effective action at appropriate times, would\r\nhave generated similar success elsewhere had it been\r\napplied with equal vigour.\r\nBut the Council cannot and should not act alone.\r\nIt should continue to consult and to seek the\r\ncooperation of other institutions within the United\r\nNations, such as the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, as well as those outside\r\nthe United Nations, especially regional organizations.\r\nAfrica is a case in point. The vast experience of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity — now the African\r\nUnion (AU) — as well as of subregional organizations,\r\nincluding the Mano River Union and the Southern\r\nAfrican Development Community, should continue to\r\nbe tapped as the Council seeks to deal with the\r\nchallenges of that great continent. We therefore\r\nwelcome the establishment of the Council’s Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa and the Council’s adoption of its\r\nrecommendations, one of which concerns cooperation\r\nwith AU. In many cases, the regional dimension holds\r\nthe key to the solution; the Council should continue to\r\nmake full use of it.\r\nIt is precisely this need for interaction, and,\r\nespecially, coordination with non-Council elements\r\nthat makes transparency so vitally important. How else\r\ncan the international community feel confident about\r\nthe Council’s decisions on matters affecting all of us?\r\nIn this connection, I should like to reiterate our\r\nappreciation for the efforts of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee to ensure transparency in its work. We hope\r\nthat these high standards will continue in future and\r\nwill also be applied in the Council’s informal and\r\nformal deliberations on other issues, particularly those\r\nhaving a direct and immediate impact on international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWhat I stated earlier is an implicit reminder of the\r\nneed to continue to assess the functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council and to reform it in a comprehensive\r\nmanner. For, without a reformed Council — one that\r\nstrikes an optimal balance between adequate\r\nrepresentation of the wider international community in\r\nthe Council and the Council’s efficiency — Member\r\nStates will never be able to feel completely certain of\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nthe fairness and effectiveness of an institution to which\r\nthey have entrusted the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security. Thailand therefore attaches great\r\nimportance to Security Council reform with respect to\r\nboth cluster 1 and cluster 2 issues.\r\nOur position on the various issues related to this\r\nmatter has not changed since we participated in the\r\ndebate on this item in the General Assembly on 31\r\nOctober last year. I wish, however, to highlight three\r\npoints, namely, the future of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup dealing with Security Council reform, the\r\ncritical need for progress in cluster 1 issues, and the\r\nneed for consultations that are not limited to the\r\nexclusive club of Council members.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to extend\r\nour appreciation to Han Seung-soo, President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, for having\r\npresided over the Working Group during the previous\r\nsession, and I should like also to thank the Bureau of\r\nthe Working Group. This year marks the tenth\r\nanniversary of the Group. It is unfortunate that, after 10\r\nyears, the Group has not yet been able to come up with\r\nsubstantive recommendations on Council reform. What\r\nit has agreed to is a report (A/56/47) which is\r\nessentially a compilation of countries’ views and\r\npositions which have remained essentially unchanged\r\nfor the past decade. If this trend continues, the Working\r\nGroup process will atrophy and with it the process of\r\nSecurity Council reform. Surely we cannot allow this\r\nto happen.\r\nPerhaps it is time for the Working Group to\r\nexplore new ways of improving its working methods\r\nwhile affirming the principle that all aspects of\r\nSecurity Council reform should be considered as a\r\npackage. In view of the current impasse, the use of\r\ninformal meetings to facilitate the Working Group’s\r\nconsultation process should be examined.\r\nA wide divergence in views remains among\r\nStates on cluster 1 issues, including the veto,\r\nmembership in the Council and periodic review of the\r\nCouncil. Delegations are reluctant to alter their views\r\non these different but interconnected issues partly\r\nbecause they are unsure of what the final package\r\nwould look like. It seems that we are so concerned with\r\nthe details that we are unable to grasp the wider picture\r\nof the reforms. We believe that, to facilitate its work,\r\nthe Group could perhaps consider developing a\r\nmethodology for coming up with multiple options with\r\nrespect to a final comprehensive reform package,\r\nwithout prejudging any country’s current position on\r\nany issue.\r\nThailand continues to call for a gradual approach\r\nto resolving the veto issue, beginning with its\r\ncurtailment and ending with its eventual abolition. We\r\ncontinue to support the expansion of Council\r\nmembership in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories on the basis of equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation and of the ability to share in the work of,\r\nand make financial and political contributions to, the\r\nUnited Nations. On that basis, we believe that Japan is\r\na worthy candidate for permanent membership in the\r\nCouncil. Furthermore, any solution regarding Council\r\nexpansion should be subject to periodic review.\r\nLastly, we hope that the Council will enhance its\r\nconsultations with non-members in its deliberations on\r\nissues affecting international peace and security. In this\r\nconnection, we attach particular importance to the\r\nCouncil’s consultations with non-members on the\r\nissues of sanctions and peacekeeping.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): My delegation strongly\r\ncondemns the terrorist acts committed in Bali on 12\r\nOctober 2002 and expresses its deepest sympathy and\r\ncondolences to the people and the Government of\r\nIndonesia and to all the victims and their families. In\r\nthis connection, we commend the Security Council for\r\nthe swift action it took through resolution 1438 (2002).\r\nOnce again, barbaric acts such as these remind us of\r\nthe need for continued international cooperation in\r\ncombating terrorism. Moreover, it becomes incumbent\r\non all of us to be vigilant and to take all necessary\r\nmeasures in dealing with terrorists in our own\r\ncountries.\r\nAllow me, Sir, to pay tribute to your\r\npredecessors, President Han Seung-soo of the Republic\r\nof Korea, President Harri Holkeri of Finland and\r\nAmbassador John de Saram of Sri Lanka for the\r\ncontributions they have made to the reform process.\r\nMy delegation thanks also Ambassador Martin\r\nBelinga-Eboutou, President of the Security Council for\r\nthe month of October, for the excellent manner in\r\nwhich he introduced the report that we are debating\r\ntoday.\r\nThe Security Council is entrusted with the\r\nprimary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security; this responsibility was\r\nconferred upon it 57 years ago. Representation on the\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nCouncil today does not correspond to international\r\nrealities, nor is the Council properly constituted to face\r\nthe current multifaceted threats to international peace\r\nand security.\r\nTaking into account changing international\r\nrealities, I should like, as the Chairman of the African\r\nworking group on reform of the Security Council,\r\nbriefly to reiterate and highlight Africa’s common\r\nposition on reforming the Council.\r\nAfrica believes that the Security Council should\r\nbe expanded in both the permanent and non-permanent\r\ncategories. This would be in keeping with the\r\noverwhelming desire of the States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations for equitable regional and geographical\r\nrepresentation. It is imperative to democratize the\r\nCouncil and thus to make it more efficient and\r\ntransparent, in view of its growing role in discharging\r\nits primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe African Group does not accept the idea of\r\nexpanding the Security Council only in the category of\r\nnon-permanent members. We strongly believe that, in\r\norder to reflect new world realities and the increasing\r\nrole of developing countries in the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, the Council should be\r\nexpanded in both categories, with adequate\r\nparticipation by developing countries. We as a group\r\nalso believe that a Council with more equitable\r\nrepresentation would not be possible without a proper\r\nincrease of membership in both categories. For us in\r\nAfrica, a Council of 26 members — for reasons of\r\nequitable geographic representation, democratization\r\nand, more important, the sharing of the collective\r\nresponsibility for maintenance of international peace\r\nand security — is a fair and balanced figure.\r\nPursuant to the 1997 Organization of African\r\nUnity (OAU) Harare Declaration, no fewer than two\r\npermanent seats, with all the privileges — including\r\nthe veto — attached thereto, should be allocated to\r\nAfrica. Here I sound a word of caution. Those who\r\nbelieve that such an expansion of the Council,\r\nparticularly of the permanent members, could occur\r\nexcluding Africa should take note that this would be\r\nunacceptable to us. Indeed, it would be a mockery of\r\nthe principles of amity and justice among nations.\r\nWhile my delegation welcomes the progress\r\nmade in the methods of work of the Council,\r\nparticularly the increase in the number of open\r\nmeetings, we still believe that the Council’s methods of\r\nwork should be further improved — to increase\r\ntransparency, accountability and effectiveness.\r\nInstitutionalization of briefings to States which\r\nare not members of the Council, public debates and\r\nparticipation of States Members of the United Nations\r\nin issues of regional and international importance need\r\nour close consideration as a matter of urgency in our\r\nfuture work in the Open-ended Working Group on the\r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase\r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other\r\nMatters Related to the Security Council.\r\nIn that connection, we would like to register our\r\nstrong objection to the marginalization and exclusion\r\nof elected members of the Security Council from\r\ninformal consultations on major regional and\r\ninternational issues. Is it not ironic that as we speak of\r\nreforming the Council for the better, we see before our\r\nvery eyes that those whom this Assembly elected to\r\nrepresent them are shunned by the unelected permanent\r\nmembers, who see the further expansion of the Council\r\nas a threat to and a dilution of their privileged power?\r\nThis reminds me of the feudal era of the Middle Ages.\r\nThe sort of privilege that allows unelected members\r\nnot only to dictate in matters of great importance to all\r\nof us, but, as we saw recently, allows them also to\r\nexclude those whom we elected in this Assembly to\r\nrepresent us on the Council, should be unacceptable to\r\nall of us.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to state that, like\r\nSouth Africa, Ethiopia supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendation to go beyond the\r\nprovisional rules and procedures towards codifying the\r\nsmall progress that has been made in the work of the\r\nCouncil in its style of work and procedures.\r\nI would like to conclude by briefly referring to\r\nthree issues. First, let me commend the Council — and\r\nwe must acknowledge where improvements have been\r\nmade — for the excellent work done so far by the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee. Under the able\r\nchairmanship of Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, that\r\nCommittee has made the Council relevant in tackling\r\nterrorism. Much still needs to be done. However, it is\r\nthe responsibility of all of us to make the war against\r\nterrorism more effective. This is a very good example\r\nof an area where reform of the Council, in ways\r\nsuggested by many delegations, would contribute to\r\ninternational peace and security. It goes without saying\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nthat where the collective security of the world is at\r\nstake, we need the broadest participation of nations.\r\nThe entire Security Council — let alone the non-\r\nelected permanent members on their own, despite all\r\ntheir economic and military power — cannot do it\r\nalone. They need the broadest participation of all\r\nnations.\r\nSecondly, it is gratifying that the Security\r\nCouncil devoted much of its work during the past year\r\nto Africa. A number of useful missions were\r\nundertaken. I would go further by suggesting that the\r\nCouncil should from time to time meet in locations\r\noutside New York, as it did on two previous occasions;\r\nonce in Africa, in my country, and once in Panama.\r\nThe third issue concerns peacekeeping missions.\r\nThese have been useful and successful, some relatively,\r\nsome more so, as seen in Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste,\r\nthe Balkans, Ethiopia and Eritrea. The United Nations\r\nMission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE), if I may\r\nconfine myself to one, began its mandate in an\r\nenvironment where for six months before setting foot\r\nin the mission area there was no shooting between the\r\nparties to the conflict. It went into an environment\r\nwhich was very conducive to the maintenance of peace.\r\nTroop-contributing countries, the Secretariat and the\r\nSecurity Council all acted promptly with the full\r\nsupport of all concerned.\r\nTo date, UNMEE has been only a qualified\r\nsuccess. It could have been a great success. I will\r\nmention only one experience which needs to be\r\ncorrected. From our own experience in Ethiopia, we\r\nfind at times, including most recently, that those in\r\npositions of command and entrusted with keeping the\r\npeace can also be a cause for serious concern. It is\r\nimportant, therefore, that while micromanagement of\r\nUnited Nations missions should not be the norm for the\r\nCouncil, as sometimes it has been, the Council should\r\nnevertheless be sensitive to such matters more than it\r\nhas been hitherto. With a new Force Commander to\r\ntake over on 1 November 2002, and together with the\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General and\r\nthe parties to the conflict, we in Ethiopia hope that\r\nUNMEE will complete its mission with great success,\r\nas originally hoped for and as we see in other areas of\r\nconflict in Africa. A lot of good progress has been\r\nmade and we hope the Security Council, with all the\r\nattention it has been paying so far, will take note of\r\nsome of these sensitive areas in other parts of the\r\ncontinent.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): It is always\r\na pleasure, Ambassador Grey-Johnson, to see you\r\ncomfortably installed on the podium, especially as the\r\nPermanent Representative of the Gambia, a brotherly\r\nand friendly African country.\r\nLet me convey my warm congratulations to\r\nAmbassador Martin Belinga-Eboutou, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Cameroon, on the brio with which he\r\nhas led the work of the Security Council this month, as\r\nwell as for the very pertinent and enriching\r\nintroductory statement he made. My renewed\r\ncompliments also go to all the new non-permanent\r\nmembers, whose contributions will be just as beneficial\r\nto the activities of the Council as were those of their\r\npredecessors.\r\nI wish to express my satisfaction and gratitude to\r\nall 15 members of that aristocratic circle for the\r\nopportunity offered to us, the foot soldiers of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, to consider once again the report of\r\nthe Security Council and the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council and related matters.\r\nBefore I continue, let me state that Senegal\r\nsupports the views and observations judiciously\r\nformulated by Ambassador Abdul Mejid Hussein,\r\nPermanent Representative of Ethiopia and Chairman of\r\nthe African working group on Security Council reform.\r\nThe report of the Security Council is a model of\r\nclarity and concision. It is a document that, above all,\r\nsheds light on the surprising and pleasant capacity of\r\nthat patrician club to integrate into its Promethean\r\napproach a certain number of the concerns of the\r\nplebeian Member States. This is, without doubt, a\r\ndemonstration of the positive spirit that led at the last\r\nsession to energetic actions culminating in the\r\nCouncil’s firm resolve, following the tragic events of\r\n11 September 2001, to undertake the fight against\r\nterrorism within the framework of the Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee established under Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nIn the same vein, I must reiterate our appreciation\r\nto the Security Council for the many public meetings it\r\nhas devoted to Africa and to issues and activities that\r\ndirectly concern it, including missions undertaken in\r\ncertain parts of the continent prey to incessant conflicts\r\nand flare-ups of violence, be they recurrent, residual or\r\nnew crises; grave violations of human rights or their\r\nconsequent humanitarian tragedies; the proliferation of\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nsmall arms; or other scourges, such as the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic, that tear apart, scar and devastate an entire\r\ncontinent.\r\nThese important efforts, which are signs of the\r\nSecurity Council’s new vitality, should be welcomed,\r\nalong with others that need to be consolidated and\r\nenhanced, including the regular and systematic\r\ndissemination of the programme of work of that organ;\r\nincreased participation of non-members in the\r\nCouncil’s work; the convening of information meetings\r\nfor non-member and troop-contributing countries in the\r\nframework of peacekeeping operations; the issuance of\r\nmonthly update reports by countries holding the\r\nCouncil presidency; and so on.\r\nSignificant progress has clearly been made. Have\r\nwe gone sufficiently far, however, in helping the\r\nSecurity Council to become what it ought to be: a body\r\nexercising to the best of its ability its full\r\nresponsibilities and prerogatives in the promotion of\r\ninternational peace and security? Given the unfortunate\r\nincrease of African conflicts and the differentiated\r\ntreatment — some might say non-treatment — they are\r\naccorded, is there not some justification for harbouring\r\nlegitimate doubt and frustration about the Council’s\r\ngenuine resolve — I do not say capacity — to intervene\r\nmore rapidly and energetically, as it did not long ago in\r\nother circumstances?\r\nIn the light of the alarming tendency of certain\r\nStates and regional organizations selectively, even\r\nunilaterally, to impose coercive measures against\r\nspecific countries, while allowing unlimited carte\r\nblanche and total impunity to others well-known for\r\ntheir systematic violations of Security Council\r\nresolutions, is there not a danger of seeing that organ\r\nevading its statutory obligations on a discretionary\r\nbasis? Is there not a risk, given this perverse logic, of\r\nthe Security Council’s alienation from its own raison\r\nd’être — the establishment of peace — and drifting\r\nthrough the negative dynamic of sanctions towards an\r\nunnatural mission — an apology for war?\r\nSince certain questions are clearly more\r\nimportant than their answers, I am led to the second\r\nitem on today’s agenda: the question of equitable\r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn this connection, Senegal praises the efforts of\r\nthe Open-ended Working Group established under\r\nresolution 48/26 of 3 December 1993 to formulate\r\nproposals on the membership and functioning of the\r\nSecurity Council in order to increase its credibility,\r\nlegitimacy and authority. It would seem that, if it is to\r\nbe credible, viable and reliable, this reform must focus\r\non the size of the Council, its working methods and,\r\nabove all, the veto.\r\nThe question of the size of the Security Council is\r\ncritical because it is evident that its current\r\ncomposition hardly takes into account the emergence\r\nand influence of new State actors on the international\r\nscene following the socio-economic and geostrategic\r\nupheavals that have taken place since the adoption of\r\nthe San Francisco Charter.\r\nIn this light, the expansion of the Council would\r\naffect the two categories of seats — permanent and\r\nnon-permanent — through a less one-sided distribution\r\nof seats between North and South. That is why Senegal\r\nbelieves that a new Council of 26 members should, as\r\nrecommended by the Organization of African Unity-\r\nAfrican Union, include a minimum of two permanent\r\nand two non-permanent seats for Africa, taking into\r\ndue account the legitimate claims of a continent keen\r\nto make its contribution, without concession or\r\nreservation, to the promotion of peace and security\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWith regard to working methods, with respect to\r\nwhich the Security Council has demonstrated a\r\ncommendable spirit of openness and transparency in\r\naddressing the many issues before the international\r\ncommunity, Senegal urges the Council to explore new\r\navenues of innovation that might include, for example,\r\nthe issuance of reports critically assessing its own\r\nperformance and of compendium reports on the notable\r\nimprovements already introduced or projected.\r\nIt is precisely on the basis of these principles of\r\nopenness and transparency that I would cite with regret\r\none current practice of the Council involving the\r\nprocess of introducing and adopting resolutions. The\r\nconviction that we share with most Member States is\r\nbased on the observation that, regardless of their\r\nmembership status, the 15 members of the Security\r\nCouncil all have an equal right to express opinions —\r\nwhich may, of course, be of unequal weight —\r\nthroughout the course of the decision-making process,\r\nin virtue of the collective responsibilities which they\r\nshare in solidarity.\r\nTo refuse to acknowledge this given and to draw\r\nappropriate conclusions from it would, I fear, be to\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\ntarnish the image and prestige of the Council, which\r\nwould be reduced to running on two speeds, with an\r\nactive minority serving as a limited senior management\r\nof decision-makers, while the other members, the\r\nmajority, would in reality be mere distinguished foils.\r\nTo refuse to acknowledge the urgency of reform\r\nwould be, in a certain way, to deny the democratic\r\nideal embodied by the United Nations, the essence of\r\nwhich is the equal, full and total participation of all its\r\nMembers, including specifically the 10 elected\r\nmembers of the Council, in the Council’s decision-\r\nmaking process.\r\nCompared to the five permanent members, the\r\nelected 10 members have the specific advantage of\r\nbeing freely and democratically elected to the Security\r\nCouncil. Hence, they incarnate a unique legitimacy\r\nderiving from the will of Member States, which they\r\nrepresent. Thus, the isolation — indeed, the apparent\r\nostracism — to which they may be unjustly confined in\r\nthe Council could be seen, were it to prove to be the\r\ncase, as a serious threat to the letter and the spirit of the\r\nCharter.\r\nTherefore, there is a vital need, within the\r\nframework of Council reforms, to review the\r\nproblematic veto power, a vestige of a time we thought\r\nlong past that has degenerated into an anachronistic\r\nright which is not only discriminatory but, today,\r\nfrankly incomprehensible. Therefore, it is imperative to\r\nlimit its use, with a view to abolishing this outdated\r\nprivilege. In order to do this, we have to start with a\r\nsubstantive discussion of the issue, in a calm,\r\nresponsible and realistic manner.\r\nIn the light of the enormous challenges faced by\r\nhumanity, Senegal has no doubt that we will together,\r\nand hand in hand with the 15 members of the Security\r\nCouncil, assume our responsibilities, armed with an\r\nardent determination to leave to future generations a\r\nworld of freedom, justice and prosperity. We shall be\r\nable together, with clear-sightedness, courage and\r\ndetermination, to take the initiatives that are needed to\r\nperpetuate this magnificent instrument of cooperation,\r\nsolidarity and peace, which the international\r\ncommunity created in order to triumph over all\r\nextremism and injustices: the United Nations.\r\nMr. Gatilov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The tragic events that occurred in the United\r\nStates on 11 September 2001 and the recent terrorist\r\nattacks in Indonesia and other countries have\r\nparticularly highlighted the imperative need for\r\nmultilateral efforts to end current threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. They have also\r\nunderscored the challenges of unparalleled magnitude\r\nfaced by the United Nations and the Security Council\r\nin this area.\r\nThe Russian Federation has always been guided\r\nby the conviction that a strong and efficient\r\nOrganization is the key tool for the collective\r\nregulation of international relations and the\r\nestablishment of a multi-polar world order based on the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law.\r\nToday, the capacity of the Security Council to\r\nrespond promptly and properly to new challenges to\r\nglobal peace is more significant than ever. The\r\nCouncil’s annual report to the General Assembly\r\n(A/57/2) provides details of its strenuous efforts and of\r\nthe concrete steps it has taken to improve its working\r\nmethods. Evidence of these are the 73 resolutions and\r\n45 presidential statements that the Council adopted\r\nduring this period. Over the past year the Security\r\nCouncil’s activities have also become more transparent.\r\nThe practice of holding open meetings and briefings on\r\nthe most urgent items on the agenda has become more\r\nfrequent, and interaction between the Security Council\r\nand troop-contributing countries has been strengthened.\r\nThe most important achievement was the creation\r\nof the Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC),\r\nwhich has proved to be a key element in the global\r\nsystem evolving under the aegis of the United Nations\r\nto combat terrorism. Through that Committee, the\r\nSecurity Council exercises its powers under the Charter\r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nOver the past year, the Security Council, in close\r\ninteraction with other organs of the United Nations\r\nsystem, has also made considerable progress in settling\r\nregional conflicts. Primary responsibility for any\r\nsettlement, of course, lies with the parties to the\r\nconflict themselves. But multilateral mechanisms have\r\nmore than once demonstrated their effectiveness in\r\nrestoring peace and reaching agreements. We can all\r\nclaim credit in helping Timor-Leste achieve\r\nindependence, establishing, with United Nations\r\nsupport, provisional self-government institutions in\r\nKosovo, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the\r\nTransitional Administration in Afghanistan, as well as\r\nin adopting resolutions which have made a practical\r\ncontribution to solving crises in a number of African\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\ncountries through the concerted efforts of the United\r\nNations and African organizations.\r\nNevertheless, there are many hot spots that\r\nremain as sources of instability in the world. The\r\nsituation in the Middle East is still far from being\r\nresolved; the Iraq and Cyprus problems also remain\r\nunresolved; there are persistent problems on the\r\nAfrican continent. Hence, the good deal of hard work\r\nthat remains requires great efforts, first and foremost\r\nthrough the political will of States to comply strictly\r\nwith the provisions of the United Nations Charter, one\r\nof which establishes the key role of the Security\r\nCouncil in maintaining peace and stability.\r\nEven this brief and far from exhaustive\r\nenumeration of the tasks facing the Security Council\r\nclearly demonstrates how right the Secretary-General\r\nwas to say that Security Council reform, as an integral\r\npart of the extensive process of renewal and\r\nimprovement of the Organization, should ensure not\r\njust the preservation, but the strengthening of the\r\nCouncil’s capacity to effectively exercise its powers\r\nunder the United Nations Charter.\r\nResolving this issue will be decisive for the\r\nfuture role of the United Nations in world affairs. It is\r\nfor precisely that reason that the Russian Federation\r\nhas so consistently sought the broadest possible\r\nagreement, ideally a consensus, on a possible formula\r\nfor expansion of the Security Council. The\r\noverwhelming majority of Members of the United\r\nNations share that approach. In keeping with that\r\nposition, we are ready to continue our painstaking\r\nefforts to reconcile the serious differences that still\r\ndivide States, particularly on the key issue of the future\r\ncomposition of the Security Council.\r\nRussia still believes that effective work by the\r\nSecurity Council should ensure an adequate balance of\r\ninterests and strengthen the trend towards reaching\r\nconsensus within the Council. In order to ensure the\r\nnecessary efficiency and viability of the Security\r\nCouncil, it is extremely important to preserve the\r\ncompactness of its composition, since an excessively\r\nlarge membership could negatively affect the quality\r\nand effectiveness of its efforts.\r\nWe remain open to constructive proposals\r\nregarding the categories within which Council\r\nmembership might be increased, on the understanding\r\nthat any expansion should embrace both industrially\r\ndeveloped and developing countries, which should be\r\ngiven equal rights and obligations. That is important if\r\nthe work of the Council is to be objective and\r\nbalanced.\r\nWe are convinced that ideas leading to\r\ninfringement of the prerogatives and powers of the\r\ncurrent permanent members of the Security Council,\r\nincluding the right of veto, are counterproductive.\r\nUnjustified criticism of the institution of the veto only\r\nfuels unnecessary emotions, and does not contribute to\r\nthe achievement of the agreement we seek on the\r\nparameters for reform. The issue of giving the veto\r\npower to new permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil may be discussed only when there is\r\nagreement on the specific composition of the\r\nmembership of an enlarged Security Council.\r\nBased on that consistent position, Russia will\r\ncontinue its constructive participation in the work\r\naimed at reaching effective and broadly supported\r\nagreements on the reform of the Security Council\r\nwithin the framework of the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup of the General Assembly. The activities of the\r\nGroup should continue to be based upon the agreed\r\nparameters, including the principle of consensus and\r\nthe package approach.\r\nSecurity Council reform will be successful only if\r\nit leads not to division but to a greater rallying of\r\nStates around this unique body bearing, on behalf of all\r\nUnited Nations Member States, the primary\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Jokonya (Zimbabwe): Through you, Sir, my\r\ndelegation offers its profound condolences to the\r\npeople and Government of Indonesia and to the\r\nfamilies of all tourists who were cruelly killed and\r\nmaimed by the cowardly and dastardly acts of\r\nterrorism. Once again, humanity has become a pawn of\r\nthe work of terrorists in our midst. The tragic events in\r\nBali are a reminder — if ever we needed one — that\r\nthe survival of the human race and the security of\r\npeoples and nations require cooperation instead of\r\nconflict. No unilateral action by any nation or group of\r\nnations, however powerful, can deal with threats to\r\ninternational peace and the security of our citizens.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the joint debate on\r\nagenda items 11 and 40, on the report of the Security\r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/57/2) and on the\r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase in\r\nthe membership of the Security Council and related\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nmatters. The Security Council, a critical arm of the\r\nUnited Nations, makes decisions that impact on the\r\nwhole Organization, if not the whole international\r\ncommunity. My delegation decries what amounts to the\r\ncurrent global apartheid in the Security Council, since\r\nit does not provide a stable multilateral system to the\r\ninhabitants of the world. Porous borders, ethnic\r\ndivisions, the exploitative nature of global capitalism\r\nand the rise of fundamentalism make the world\r\nvulnerable to saboteurs and terrorists. Only a\r\ndemocratized global governance can make the world\r\nsafe to live in.\r\nThe permanent members of this Council which\r\nhas been endowed with the responsibility of providing\r\nsecurity and peace for all mankind need not be\r\nreminded that they hold those positions in trust and, as\r\nsuch, not only are expected to desist from taking\r\nnarrow and parochial decisions oriented by national\r\ninterests but should always strive to preserve the\r\nauthority and credibility of the Charter of the United\r\nNations and international law. Current deliberations in\r\nthe Council with regard to the situation in Iraq do not\r\naugur well, for there is a general perception that\r\nattempts are being made to fast-track solutions that are\r\nnot in conformity with the Charter. Common sense,\r\nwhich is not very common these days, rejects the\r\n“might is right” concept.\r\nAlmost ten years have passed since we began to\r\ndiscuss the reform of the Security Council, and yet we\r\nare no closer to finding agreement in the critical areas\r\nof reforming the Council. Instead of agreeing quickly\r\non the reform of the Security Council, Members\r\ncontinue to fall back on positions articulated\r\nyesteryear, and that procrastination has hampered the\r\nsmooth operation of the Organization. There is urgency\r\nin increasing membership of the Security Council in\r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories so\r\nthat those nations that joined the United Nations after\r\nits formation in 1945 will also have representation.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, our leaders tasked\r\nthe General Assembly to intensify its efforts to achieve\r\na comprehensive reform and democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects as a matter of\r\nurgency. The longer we take to conclude that matter,\r\nthe more we jeopardize international security. I do not\r\nneed to remind one and all that this state of affairs\r\nrenders the United Nations irrelevant on issues\r\npertaining to international peace and security.\r\nAfrica and Southern America do not enjoy\r\nrepresentation in the permanent seat category of the\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation rejects the notion that\r\nthere should be no increase in the permanent seat\r\ncategory. That argument, in our view, supports what we\r\nreferred to earlier as global apartheid, meant to keep\r\nthe unrepresented out of meaningful participation in\r\nSecurity Council matters despite the fact that 70 per\r\ncent of the Security Council’s time is spent on Third\r\nWorld problems. In that context, the Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the African Union demanded in Harare\r\nin 1997 that two permanent seats be rotated among\r\nAfrican States in a reformed Security Council. Surely\r\nthat is not an unreasonable demand.\r\nWhat is to be done? First, the onus, in our view,\r\nis on the permanent members to pronounce themselves\r\nclearly on two specific issues: whether they accept an\r\nexpansion of the Security Council in the permanent\r\ncategory, and if so, whether the new members would\r\nenjoy the same prerogatives as they themselves enjoy.\r\nOr do they want to continue with the apartheid that\r\nexists at the present moment? Secondly, do the five\r\npermanent members accept an expansion of the\r\nreformed Council to a level that will cover other\r\nregions not currently represented? And if so, by how\r\nmuch? It is our considered view that once this is done,\r\nnegotiations are likely to proceed at a much faster rate\r\nthan has been the case so far.\r\nMy delegation would like to suggest that the\r\nWorking Group take a decision by vote. It is our\r\nconsidered view that the reform of the Security Council\r\nwill never enjoy consensus, particularly in the critical\r\nareas of the veto and the optimum levels to which the\r\nSecurity Council should be expanded. Indeed, there\r\nwas no consensus on the working methods and powers\r\nof the Security Council when it was established in\r\n1945. We recommend that the Working Group take a\r\nvote on the matter. Should it enjoy the support of two-\r\nthirds of the membership, it should be adopted.\r\nOur conviction is that the business of maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security cannot be left to the\r\nwhims of a few, 57 years after the establishment of the\r\nUnited Nations. To do so would be a dereliction of its\r\ninternational duty on the part of the General Assembly.\r\nIt is axiomatic that those who elevate democracy to the\r\nlevel of a creed in the national affairs of Member States\r\nare guilty of double standards, since they are defenders\r\nof international apartheid when it comes to\r\ninternational relations, where their preoccupation is\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nglobal capitalism. But in the face of international\r\nterrorism, and in the interest of peace and security, in\r\nthe current state of insecurity the international\r\ncommunity faces the challenge of resolving tensions by\r\nusing creative elements and cooperation instead of\r\nconfrontation. That challenge will involve the\r\ndemocratization of global governance and not gunboat\r\ndiplomacy, since the latter cannot accommodate the\r\ninterests and perspectives of the world’s inhabitants.\r\nMy delegation will therefore throw its weight\r\nbehind you in the Working Group, Mr. President, in\r\norder to ensure a speedy reform of the Security\r\nCouncil. Genuine democratic reforms in global\r\ngovernance entail democratization at all levels,\r\nincluding increasing transparency, accountability and\r\nbroader participation in the decision-making process.\r\nPermanent members must accept this not only when it\r\ncomes to the fight against terrorism.\r\nMr. ahović (Yugoslavia): I would like, at the\r\noutset, to offer our deepest condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of Indonesia in\r\nthe wake of horrendous terrorist attack that took a\r\nheavy toll in human life and caused extensive damage.\r\nWe also express our condolences to the Governments\r\nand peoples of the several countries that lost nationals\r\nin that tragedy.\r\nTurning to the subject of our debate, allow me to\r\nbegin by expressing my delegation’s appreciation to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, Ambassador\r\nBelinga-Eboutou, Permanent Representative of\r\nCameroon, for his introduction of the report of the\r\nSecurity Council. I would also like to pay tribute to the\r\noutgoing members of the Council for their valuable\r\ncontributions in the past period, and to extend\r\ncongratulations to the newly elected members of the\r\nSecurity Council — Angola, Chile, Germany, Pakistan\r\nand Spain. I wish them success in discharging their\r\nimportant duties in the coming two years.\r\nAs the report of the Security Council states at the\r\nvery beginning, the past year was one of the busiest in\r\nthe history of the Council. Indeed, if we examine the\r\nreport we can see that the Council’s agenda was very\r\nbroad, ranging from acute crises, such as the one in the\r\nMiddle East and those in some areas of Africa, to\r\nissues of a more general nature — for example, the role\r\nof the Security Council in the prevention of armed\r\nconflict and the subject of children in armed conflict.\r\nHowever, the activism of the Security Council was in\r\ngood part due to the work of the exceptionally\r\nproductive and efficient Counter-Terrorism Committee\r\n(CTC). I will not elaborate on the achievements of the\r\nCTC at this point, since the topic was extensively\r\naddressed at the recent open meeting of the Security\r\nCouncil devoted to that subject. Nevertheless, my\r\ndelegation would once again like to express our\r\nappreciation for the quality of interaction between the\r\nCTC and the membership of the United Nations. That\r\ninteraction has become a model of transparency that\r\nshould serve as an example in other areas of Security\r\nCouncil activity. Although it was not mentioned in the\r\nreport, allow me also to express our appreciation for\r\nthe practice of some Security Council members to\r\ndevote both time and effort to continuously update the\r\nwider membership on the Council’s activities.\r\nLast year’s debate obviously influenced the\r\nformat and content of the current report. This is evident\r\nnot only from the welcome reduction in its size, but\r\nparticularly from the analytical introductory chapter,\r\nwhich we would like to believe is a preliminary step to\r\nfurther improvement in the reporting process. It may\r\nalso be a sign of introducing greater substance into the\r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn recent years the Security Council has\r\ndeveloped the practice of sending missions to troubled\r\nregions on its agenda. In the reporting period under our\r\nconsideration, the Council undertook three missions —\r\nto Yugoslavia, Ethiopia and Eritrea and the Great Lakes\r\nregion — while yet another one took place in July, to\r\nthe countries of the Mano River Union. We commend\r\nthe ever-more-frequent practice of the Security Council\r\nof leaving its Chamber in order to gain first-hand\r\nknowledge of developments within peacekeeping\r\noperations under the Council’s mandate. The\r\ncooperation between Yugoslavia and the Security\r\nCouncil has notably improved since the Council’s\r\nmission to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in June\r\n2001. Our cooperation with the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has also\r\nintensified. We welcome the forthcoming Council\r\nmission to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which\r\nwill visit both Kosovo and Metohija and Belgrade, and\r\nhope it will have a similarly positive effect.\r\nA significant part of the report of the Security\r\nCouncil deals directly with my country and our region.\r\nI am pleased to say that progress has been achieved in\r\nthe last year on an issue of significant importance to\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As a result of\r\nintensive negotiations, Yugoslavia and Croatia have\r\nreached an agreement on the concept of a provisional\r\ntransboundary regime in Prevlaka. The presence of\r\nUnited Nations observers has been a key factor in\r\nsecuring a stable situation on the ground, thereby\r\nenabling the two sides to engage fully in the quest for a\r\nmutually acceptable solution. It is our expectation that\r\nthe recent extension of the presence of the United\r\nNations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP)\r\nwill make it possible for us to finalize the necessary\r\npractical arrangements concerning putting in place a\r\nprovisional transboundary regime.\r\nUNMIK was another mission in the region under\r\nthe Security Council’s mandate that has performed very\r\nwell. The fact that a mission of the European Union\r\nwill soon replace it is proof of good cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional entities and\r\norganizations.\r\nI would like to add that the termination, in\r\nSeptember 2001, of prohibitions imposed by resolution\r\n1160 (1998) was of course a very important\r\ndevelopment for Yugoslavia, as it finally abolished the\r\nlast remaining United Nations sanctions against my\r\ncountry. However, even resolution 1367 (2001), which\r\ndealt with this matter, noted the difficult security\r\nsituation along Kosovo’s administrative boundary and\r\nparts of the border with the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia. This assessment is still valid, not only with\r\nregard to the borders and boundaries but with respect\r\nto the entire province. We therefore welcome the\r\ncontinued engagement of the Security Council, which\r\nis evident from the regular monthly debates that closely\r\nmonitor the performance of UNMIK and the situation\r\non the ground. We believe this practice should be\r\ncontinued.\r\nIn that context, allow me to mention that the\r\nreport’s introduction commends the Council’s “low-key\r\napproach” to Kosovo and Metohija. It is our belief that\r\nKosovo and Metohija has entered an exceptionally\r\nsensitive phase of institution-building. It is therefore\r\nextremely important that the political process is\r\nchannelled in the direction of long-lasting stability and\r\nthe true establishment of a multi-ethnic and democratic\r\nsociety, with the full involvement of the Security\r\nCouncil rather than through a “low-key approach”.\r\nMy delegation also cannot fail to refer to the part\r\nof the report that deals with the work of the subsidiary\r\nbodies of the Security Council, particularly the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia. Regrettably, some of the assertions are in\r\nobvious contradiction with facts stated in the same\r\nchapter. We can in no way accept the counterfactual\r\nallegation that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nremains an obstacle to the implementation of the\r\nProsecutor’s mandate when former President Slobodan\r\nMilosevic stands trial as we speak and 14 indictees\r\nhave been taken from Yugoslavia’s territory and put\r\ninto the custody of the Tribunal.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation for the continuing\r\nconstructive engagement of the Security Council.\r\nAlong with many previous speakers, we express our\r\nhope that the long-standing efforts to achieve\r\nmeaningful Security Council reform will receive the\r\npolitical impetus that is evidently needed. In the\r\nmeantime, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would\r\nlike to reiterate the necessity of implementing Security\r\nCouncil resolutions with equal resolve, be it\r\nconcerning Iraq, the situation in the Middle East or\r\nBalkan issues.\r\nMr. Stanczyk (Poland): At the outset, I would\r\nlike to express my deep condolences to the\r\nGovernment and people of Indonesia, as well as to\r\nother countries whose nationals lost their lives in the\r\nrecent terrorist attack in Bali.\r\nLet me begin by addressing our agenda item on\r\nthe report of the Security Council for the year ending\r\n31 July 2002 (A/57/2). As evident at first glance, this\r\nyear’s report of the Council is different from past ones.\r\nWe welcome this change in format; it makes the report\r\nmore concise and focused and thus enhances its\r\nrelevance to our needs. The analytical introduction is a\r\nuseful overview of the key aspects of the Council’s\r\nwork and gives us a better perspective of the issues\r\nunder consideration by the Council. I wish to join all\r\nthose who expressed their gratitude to Ambassador\r\nMahbubani for his, as well as his delegation’s,\r\ninvolvement in bringing about this important change.\r\nThe previous year was particularly challenging\r\nfor the Council. The terrorist attacks against the United\r\nStates of America on 11 September 2001 brought home\r\nthe scale of the threat posed by terrorism to\r\ninternational peace and security. The unanimous and\r\ndecisive action taken by the Security Council in\r\nresponse to those attacks demonstrated that the United\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nNations is able to stand united in the face of threats to\r\nthe whole international community. But it also\r\ndemonstrated that our Organization is indispensable for\r\neffectively dealing with problems of a global nature. A\r\ncase in point is the operation of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, which, under the dynamic leadership of Sir\r\nJeremy Greenstock, has shown that determination and\r\nperseverance can make a real difference.\r\nWhile the question of international terrorism has\r\nbeen of highest priority on the Council’s agenda during\r\nthe year under review, other important issues relating\r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security\r\ncontinued to be the focus of its attention.\r\nIn Africa, the Great Lakes region remained a\r\nmajor concern, and, thanks to the Council’s\r\nengagement, we have noted some positive\r\ndevelopments towards stability in that part of the\r\ncontinent. The Council has remained engaged in the\r\nEthiopia/Eritrea dispute, where the decision on border\r\ndelimitation is an important step towards achieving a\r\ndurable peace. Likewise, the presence of United\r\nNations peacekeepers in Sierra Leone has brought a\r\ntangible contribution to improving the situation in that\r\ncountry, although the overall situation in West Africa\r\nremains of serious concern.\r\nWe believe that Security Council missions to\r\nconflict areas are an important tool at its disposal in the\r\nresolution of conflicts and in bringing lasting peace to\r\ntroubled regions. We believe that this has now become\r\na permanent feature of the Council’s work, adding to\r\nthe panoply of instruments at its disposal for the\r\nmaintenance of peace.\r\nViolence and loss of life marked yet another year\r\nin the continuation of the Middle East conflict, which\r\nwas the focus of the Council’s attention on many\r\noccasions. Security Council resolution 1397 (2002),\r\nconfirming the right of existence of both Israel and\r\nPalestine within secure and recognized borders, has\r\nbeen an important step taken towards lasting peace in\r\nthe region. The Council has our full support in its\r\nefforts to achieve this goal.\r\nWe commend the decision to provide assistance\r\nto the newly independent Timor-Leste by means of the\r\nUnited Nations Mission of Support in East Timor\r\n(UNMISET), after the expiration of the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration. United\r\nNations support in the early stages of statehood will\r\nallow the new democratic institutions to gain a steady\r\nfoothold and the experience necessary for governing\r\nthe country.\r\nThe Council’s role has been, likewise, pivotal in\r\ncreating conditions for the establishment of a\r\nTransitional Administration in Afghanistan. The\r\nestablishment of the International Security Assistance\r\nForce (ISAF) has made an important contribution\r\ntowards creating a more secure environment in which\r\nthe new Government can operate. It is important to\r\nmaintain United Nations involvement in Afghanistan\r\nuntil democracy is firmly established.\r\nPositive developments in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia allowed for the lifting of the Security\r\nCouncil arms embargo on that country, and the\r\nCouncil’s efforts helped in increasing stability in\r\nKosovo. The impending assumption of greater\r\nresponsibilities by the European Union after the\r\ntermination of the mandate of the United Nations\r\nMission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) is also\r\na sign of increased stability in the region. The\r\nCouncil’s efforts over the previous year have further\r\ncontributed to an overall increase of security in the\r\nBalkans.\r\nA brief overview of the Council’s work clearly\r\ndemonstrates its importance to the whole international\r\ncommunity. It is, therefore, all the more troubling that,\r\nafter nine years of deliberation, we still have not been\r\nable to achieve a consensus on a comprehensive reform\r\nof the Council. One point on which we all agree is that\r\nsuch reform is needed — if not indispensable — for the\r\nability of the Council, in years to come, to efficiently\r\ndischarge the functions ascribed to it in the Charter.\r\nThe important changes in the international architecture\r\nthat took place since the last adjustment of the Council\r\nsome four decades ago should not be ignored.\r\nPoland continues to support the proposal for\r\nexpansion of the Council in both categories of\r\nmembership. An increase in the category of permanent\r\nmembers should address the legitimate expectations of\r\nunderrepresented regions — that is, Africa, Asia and\r\nLatin America — and take into account the important\r\nrole in international relations assumed by Germany and\r\nJapan. Their aspirations to shoulder heavier\r\ninternational responsibilities find our full support.\r\nThe non-permanent category of membership\r\nshould also be expanded so as to increase the overall\r\nrepresentativeness of the Council. The regional group\r\nof Eastern European States, whose membership in the\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.31\r\nUnited Nations has increased significantly during the\r\nlast decade, should be allocated an additional non-\r\npermanent seat in a reformed Council.\r\nThe question of the veto should also be addressed\r\nduring this process. While the issue is complex and\r\nhighly divisive, a solution should ensure the ability of\r\nthe Council to function effectively, since increased\r\nefficiency of the Council is one of the goals of the\r\nOpen-ended Working Group.\r\nIt needs, however, to be pointed out that the\r\nWorking Group has made important progress in\r\nreforming the methods of work and the transparency of\r\nthe Security Council. Several of the proposals put\r\nforward during the discussion on Council reform have\r\nalready been implemented by the Council itself. One\r\nsuch example are the new rules for meetings with\r\ntroop-contributing countries. This is a welcome\r\nimprovement, as those who directly contribute to\r\npeacekeeping operations established by the Council\r\nshould be informed and consulted in advance of any\r\nmajor developments relating to the operation.\r\nThe increased transparency of the Council’s work\r\nalso has to be acknowledged. The number of open\r\nmeetings held by the Council over the past year is\r\nunprecedented. At the same time, the quality of\r\ninformation provided to a wider membership by the\r\nCouncil’s successive Presidents has continued to\r\nimprove. Thematic debates on issues of direct\r\nrelevance to international peace and security, such as\r\nincreasing the protection of civilians and women and\r\nchildren in armed conflict, helped to increase the\r\nunderstanding of the broader context of the Council’s\r\nwork. Those developments, however timely and useful,\r\ncannot be a substitute for comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe are, therefore, looking forward to a\r\nconstructive debate on this issue. In light of the\r\nincreasing tasks that fall on the Council, it is more\r\nimportant than ever before.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda items 11 and 40 for\r\nthis meeting. We will continue the debate on these\r\nitems this afternoon at 3 p.m.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
