As we said\r\nduring the three-day debate on the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF), we found his report on that item\r\n(A/57/156 and Corr.1) to be very useful and\r\ninformative. That report has been very important in\r\nshaping the draft resolution that was adopted only this\r\nmorning in the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which is bringing the UN-NADAF\r\nera to a close and replacing it with the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) as the new policy\r\nframework for Africa, around which the international\r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, should\r\nconcentrate its efforts for Africa’s development.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/57/172) contains\r\na very insightful analysis and diagnosis of the\r\nchallenges facing Africa, with most useful proposals\r\nand comments. The updated matrix on the\r\nimplementation of the Secretary-General’s original\r\nrecommendations gives a clear picture of progress that\r\nhas been made, as well as continuing constraints while\r\nproposing remedial action. This is an excellent\r\nplanning tool for future action.\r\nBefore I comment further on the reports before\r\nus, allow me to make some observations about today’s\r\ndebate. This is quite a momentous day, not only\r\nbecause of the importance of the items under\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\ndiscussion, but because Africa is, in a way, leading the\r\nway in the United Nations reform process.\r\nWe constantly hear calls for improving the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations,\r\nincluding the General Assembly. Today there is an\r\nexample of what can be done. We have recognized the\r\nlinkages between the three items on African\r\ndevelopment on the General Assembly agenda and, in\r\nthe spirit of a comprehensive and holistic approach to\r\nissues, these items have been combined into one\r\ndebate. This allows us to address all these issues and\r\nthereby avoid potential duplication in the debates of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. This, in my delegation’s view, is a\r\ngood example of improving the work programme of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMy delegation also has other reasons for\r\nbelieving that it is appropriate for these items to be\r\nconsidered together. The Secretary-General’s report of\r\n1998 stressed the link between peace and development,\r\nwhile presenting a comprehensive and holistic\r\napproach to conflict prevention, poverty eradication\r\nand sustainable development in Africa. The New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) that\r\nwill in future replace the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa (UN-NADAF) item on\r\nthe General Assembly’s agenda, also clearly\r\nrecognized that linkage, when it acknowledged that\r\npeace and security, among other things, are conditions\r\nfor sustainable development.\r\nAs we have said in recent weeks we had\r\nnumerous occasions to reflect on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the UN-NADAF review and\r\nappraisal, therefore allow me to today focus my\r\ncomments on the report on the “Causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa”.\r\nMy delegation commends the role of the\r\nSecretary-General over the last months in assisting\r\nwith the prevention and resolution of conflicts, not\r\nonly in Africa but all over the world. We have\r\nwitnessed the rewards of his determined vision for\r\npeace in Sierra Leone with the successful holding of\r\ndemocratic elections in that country, and the progress\r\nregistered in nurturing peace in the subregion. We also\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s unrelenting efforts to\r\nbring about peace in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and the Great Lakes region.\r\nIn July 2002, at the inaugural Summit of the\r\nAfrican Union, African leaders, inspired by the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), took\r\nthe historic decision to alter and enhance the\r\nmechanisms for the prevention, management and\r\nresolution of conflicts in Africa. An important element\r\nof this decision was the acknowledgement that African\r\ncountries, collectively, should enhance their\r\npeacekeeping capacities in order to intervene in\r\nconflicts with a view to their resolution. This\r\nrecognition stems from the reality that there remains a\r\nsignificant gap in some quarters of the international\r\ncommunity when the requirement is to act on African\r\nconflicts.\r\nThere is no doubt about the complexity of the\r\ntask at hand; in order for any efforts to be successful, a\r\nrange of partnerships between African countries and\r\nthe rest of the international community will be\r\nrequired. The focus of these partnerships, however,\r\nneeds to move beyond the mere training of\r\npeacekeepers, to look seriously at what the real needs\r\nare in order to ensure effective peacekeeping by\r\nAfrican countries. An important aspect in this regard is\r\nthe provision of logistical support and other key\r\nresources that are critical for the success of any\r\npeacekeeping operation.\r\nIt is my delegation’s view that the United Nations\r\nis suitably placed to play a leading role in facilitating\r\nand establishing these partnerships. My delegation will\r\nbe working with others in the next few months to\r\nexplore the possible areas where the United Nations\r\ncould make a contribution to African efforts in conflict\r\nresolution.\r\nIn Africa, we are beginning to make great\r\nprogress in our efforts to achieve peace. However, the\r\nmere resolution of conflict and the establishment of\r\npeace are not sufficient for creating a stable and\r\nprosperous continent. Post-conflict reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment are important to the delivery of an early\r\npeace dividend and essential for launching sustainable\r\ndevelopment, thereby minimizing the destitution and\r\nmarginalization which could form the seedbeds in\r\nwhich the next conflict could germinate.\r\nMy delegation is thus particularly encouraged by\r\nthe recent decision by the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil to establish an Ad hoc Advisory Group on\r\nAfrican countries emerging from conflict. We also\r\nwelcome the decision to respond positively to the\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nrequest by Guinea-Bissau for such an Advisory Group,\r\nand my delegation looks forward to contributing as\r\nmuch as possible to the success of the Group. We are\r\nalso convinced that it could make a real contribution to\r\nthe sustainable development and rebuilding of that\r\nfellow African country and that the people of Guinea-\r\nBissau deserve no less from this Organization.\r\nThe issues highlighted in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport as being important for building durable peace\r\nand encouraging sustainable development in Africa\r\ncoincide fully with the thinking in NEPAD. The\r\npromotion of good governance, capacity-building,\r\nhuman resource development, public health services,\r\nthe role of women, international aid, debt relief, market\r\naccess, and regional cooperation and integration,\r\nmentioned in the report, are very much in line with the\r\npriorities contained in this initiative. We fully\r\nsubscribe to the idea that all these issues, while by no\r\nmeans suggested as exhaustive, are important when\r\ntrying to address the way to ensure durable peace and\r\nsustainable development on the continent.\r\nMy delegation also fully supports the proposals in\r\nthe report on the full funding of the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, on the untying\r\nof aid to all African countries in order to improve aid\r\neffectiveness and on the need to fully address the\r\nexternal debt situation of all heavily indebted African\r\ncountries.\r\nWhile Africa has taken control of its own\r\ndevelopment agenda in NEPAD, it has also recognized\r\nthe critical role of international support in true\r\npartnership. This includes the need to provide\r\nincreased resources to the continent. We thus support\r\nthe proposal made in the report that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral urge the donor community to double official\r\nflows to Africa, in line with the recommendations\r\nmade at the March 2002 meeting of the High Level\r\nCommittee on Programmes of the United Nations\r\nSystem Chief Executives Board for Coordination.\r\nWe are all excited by the fact that Africa has\r\ntaken charge of its own future through NEPAD. This is\r\nalso an invitation to the international community to\r\nforge new partnerships through which we can together\r\nstrive towards achieving the Millennium and other\r\ndevelopment goals. Let us not be found wanting.\r\nIn this respect, my delegation is particularly\r\npleased that the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the\r\nGeneral Assembly for the Final Review and Appraisal\r\nof the implementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\nthis morning adopted the resolution on UN-NADAF\r\nand NEPAD. We believe that it provides a very good\r\nframework for developing international support for\r\nNEPAD. We also appreciate the balanced manner in\r\nwhich it approached the issue by addressing the roles\r\nof all stakeholders. It also recognized the primacy of\r\nAfrican countries in the development and\r\nimplementation of NEPAD.\r\nIt is important, in our deliberations on NEPAD, to\r\nremember that these deliberations are not abstract, but\r\nare focused on how we deliver NEPAD, because lying\r\nbehind the question of how to take NEPAD forward are\r\nquestions such as how to take our macroeconomic\r\ngains down to the farmers in our rural villages and to\r\nthe shopkeepers and hawkers in our cities, and how to\r\nensure that mothers can raise healthy children who can\r\ntake advantage of well-run schools.\r\nOver the past two years, we have seen a number\r\nof international summits and conferences, such as the\r\nMillennium Summit, the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries, the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, all of which embraced the notion of\r\npartnership. This has been elaborated to address the\r\nserious challenges in the international financial\r\narchitecture, poverty reduction and development facing\r\nthe global community and Africa in particular.\r\nAfrican finance ministers and their deputies are\r\nmeeting at this moment in Johannesburg to consider\r\nand construct their end of the partnership, not because\r\nanybody says they must, but to show leadership in\r\nidentifying and resolving the serious challenges\r\nconfronting us.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe delegation of Colombia is pleased to participate in\r\nthis debate of the General Assembly dedicated, in\r\nessence, to the special needs of the economic\r\ndevelopment of Africa, the achievement of lasting\r\npeace in the continent and the ways in which the\r\nUnited Nations should respond to these objectives.\r\nIn particular, we are tasked with the final review\r\nand appraisal of the implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF), which, for 10 years, was the\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nframework of the efforts of our Organization in favour\r\nof African development.\r\nIt is an endeavour made possible today thanks to\r\nthe informative documents prepared by the Secretariat\r\nand, especially, to the independent assessment of the\r\nimplementation of UN-NADAF conducted by the\r\ngroup of eminent personalities led by Mr. Kwesi\r\nBotchwey. Let me thank him and his collaborators for\r\nthe high quality of the document submitted and their\r\nvaluable conclusions and recommendations.\r\nMy delegation also wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to pay tribute to the United Nations\r\nagencies, funds and programmes that throughout these\r\n10 years have carried out the African programmes.\r\nThanks to them, the States Members of the United\r\nNations have been in a position to share in the\r\nsolidarity and efforts for economic and social\r\ndevelopment of the African peoples and their longing\r\nfor peace. We count on this decade-long experience to\r\nrenew the work of the Organization for the years to\r\ncome.\r\nThe delegation of Colombia shares the view\r\nwidely expressed in this debate and by the heads of\r\nState and ministers of foreign affairs who spoke during\r\nthe high-level meeting on the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) on 16 September, to\r\nthe effect that the goals of NEPAD must be our anchor\r\nin designing the future relationship of the United\r\nNations with the countries of Africa.\r\nIt is a relationship to be based on deepening the\r\ngoals of NEPAD in three different spheres: first, the\r\nAfrican countries themselves, as they incorporate the\r\nNEPAD vision into their own strategic planning;\r\nsecondly, the United Nations, as the reality of NEPAD\r\nruns through the several strata of the Organization; and\r\nthirdly, the partner countries of African development,\r\nin particular the more advanced economies in the\r\nworld.\r\nWe remain fully convinced that the goals of the\r\nNEPAD vision — peace, security, democracy and good\r\ngovernance, as well as the social and economic\r\ndevelopment and regional cooperation and integration\r\nof Africa — can be consolidated by and benefit from\r\nthe help of the strengths of the United Nations. Our\r\nOrganization is in a position to offer information and\r\nanalysis, as well as technical assistance; to act as a\r\nforum to advocate and articulate the interests of\r\nAfrican peoples; and also, by bringing the international\r\ncommunity together, to undertake actions in favour of\r\npeace and international development.\r\nWe need, of course, to adjust these strengths to\r\nthe particular needs of Africa. In that respect, the\r\nindependent appraisers of UN-NADAF recommend to\r\nus two basic measures: first, providing the United\r\nNations with sufficient means to carry out this mission;\r\nand secondly, bringing harmony into its universe of\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThey also put before us a set of practical\r\nmeasures already reflected in the draft resolution\r\nwhose negotiation is being ably conducted by the\r\ndelegation of Brazil. For instance, there is a need to\r\nconcentrate in one office of the Secretariat the\r\npreparation of all the reports on the development of\r\nAfrica and to manage the implementation of the new\r\nAfrican programme at the appropriate executive level.\r\nIn addition, our delegation believes that the annual\r\ndeliberation on African issues by the General\r\nAssembly could be combined into one single debate.\r\nWe are mindful that the long-term purpose of the\r\nAfrican peoples is, as stated in the NEPAD action plan,\r\n“to extricate themselves and the continent from\r\nthe malaise of underdevelopment and exclusion in\r\na globalizing world”.\r\nThat is a goal that a developing country such as\r\nColombia can fully appreciate and share. We have\r\ntherefore found it worthwhile to work with other\r\ncountries of Latin America on plans for regional and\r\nsubregional economic integration.\r\nIn addition, our efforts to integrate ourselves into\r\ntoday’s globalized economy have given rise to as-yet\r\nunmet expectations that could nevertheless serve as\r\npoints of reference for African countries. A report by\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme looking\r\ninto Latin America’s experience with globalization,\r\nsingled out, among other things, the region’s difficulty\r\nin protecting its peoples from the negative effects of\r\nglobalization, a concentration of knowledge and wealth\r\nat the level of the elite, rising environmental\r\ndegradation and the phenomenon of economic growth\r\nin the absence of growth in employment. These\r\nfindings should signal to African countries that they\r\nshould not expect too much from globalization.\r\nFinally, given that we have participated in the\r\nSecurity Council for almost two years, the delegation\r\nof Colombia is particularly keen to comment on the\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nissue of how peace and security are linked to Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. The Secretary-General’s 1998 report on\r\nthe causes of conflict and the promotion of\r\ndevelopment had already clearly illustrated that\r\nnegative correlation. In fact, one of the major\r\nconclusions of the assessment team that evaluated the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s put it very succinctly: conflict and\r\ndevelopment are mortal enemies. That fact is\r\nconfirmed annually by the Human Development\r\nReport, which also points out that countries at the\r\nbottom of the human development index are either\r\ngoing through conflicts or emerging from them.\r\nIn the Security Council we have supported the\r\nefforts made by the United Nations to strengthen\r\nAfrican countries’ successful initiatives. We very much\r\nwelcome the current peace negotiations taking place in\r\nKenya with regard to the Sudan and Somalia. We also\r\nwelcome the return of peace to Sierra Leone and\r\nAngola this year, and look with optimism to the\r\nprogress being made in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nLooking to the future, we would like to single out\r\nthree healthy trends within the Organization regarding\r\npeacekeeping and security in Africa. The first of those\r\ntrends is the deepening relationship between the United\r\nNations and the African Union and various regional\r\nand subregional organizations in the areas of conflict\r\nprevention, peacekeeping operations and post-conflict\r\npeace-building. In that vein, for example, the Council\r\nthis week has expressed its support for the observation\r\nforce that the Economic Community of Central African\r\nStates will deploy on the border between Chad and the\r\nCentral African Republic.\r\nThe second trend is the growing tendency of the\r\nOrganization to focus on the regional character of\r\nconflicts and, in so doing, to name special\r\nrepresentatives for the relevant regions. At the\r\nmoment, such representatives have been named for the\r\nGreat Lakes region and for West Africa, the latter of\r\nwhich was the subject of a debate during Colombia’s\r\npresidency of the Council in August 2001.\r\nThe third trend is reflected in the excellent work\r\nbeing carried out by the Security Council Open-ended\r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Causes of Conflict and\r\nPromotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in Africa, which is being led in an\r\nexemplary manner by the Ambassador of Mauritius.\r\nOne of the Group’s accomplishments has been to bring\r\ntogether the Economic and Social Council and the\r\nSecurity Council to focus on their respective\r\nmanagement functions relating to strengthening peace\r\nin countries emerging from conflict.\r\nThe experiences I have mentioned serve to\r\nencourage my delegation’s belief that cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations as a whole and African\r\ncountries can indeed be fruitful. Such cooperation\r\nshould also occur in every area of concern to the\r\ncontinent. That is the conviction that brings us to this\r\ndebate — a belief on whose behalf he delegation of\r\nColombia is prepared to make its best effort.\r\nMr. George (Nigeria): The popular image of\r\nAfrica in the outside world, in both electronic and print\r\nmedia, is one of incessant conflict and political\r\ninstability. Yet it need not be so, because in reality\r\nAfrica is a richly endowed continent, beautiful and\r\nhospitable. Conflicts within and between African\r\ncountries are neither innate nor necessarily inevitable.\r\nGiven the right attitude and approach, they could be\r\nprevented or minimized, if not totally eradicated. In\r\nthat regard, Nigeria welcomes the continuing efforts of\r\nthe United Nations, and especially the personal\r\ncommitment of the Secretary-General, to solving\r\nconflicts and laying the foundation for durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa.\r\nTaking into account the Secretary-General’s\r\ncomprehensive report (A/52/871) on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa, the world\r\ncommunity can no longer feign ignorance of the causes\r\nand effects of conflict in Africa. The landmark report,\r\nfor which we thank the Secretary-General, not only\r\nidentified the root causes of the conflicts on the\r\ncontinent, it also spelled out the roles that African\r\nleaders and the international community, including the\r\nUnited Nations system, can play in solving them.\r\nFurthermore, the report underscores the need for\r\ncollective effort in the search for durable peace,\r\nstability, post-conflict reconstruction, reconciliation\r\nand rehabilitation.\r\nIndeed, different studies and sources attest to the\r\nfact that Africa’s conflicts reflect the continent’s\r\ndiversity, historical evolution and experience, as well\r\nas its engagement with the outside world. They are\r\nlocated in the history of Africa, its colonial past and\r\nthe challenges of building virile and sustainable\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nmodern State structures. Those challenges have been\r\ncompounded by the dynamics of internal politics, often\r\ninterpreted and seen as the spoils of office. Access to\r\npolitical power brings with it benefits, privileges and a\r\nsense of security; while the lack of access creates\r\ninsecurity, rivalry and outright hostility.\r\nEconomic motivations, often dictated by profit\r\nand greed, are also known to be responsible for conflict\r\nin Africa. It is pertinent to note that the traffic in arms,\r\nblood diamonds, oil and other commodities would be\r\nless intense were there no gains for the traffickers.\r\nHowever, many conflicts have become intractable due\r\nto the gains derived while they lasted. We also cannot\r\ntake for granted the contribution of peculiarity and\r\ncircumstance in fuelling conflict in Africa. The\r\nstruggle for land, control of natural resources, access to\r\namenities, ethnicity, religious beliefs and other\r\nincipient factors are known to have caused countless\r\nconflicts in Africa.\r\nAs could be expected, the cost of those conflicts\r\nto Africa is incalculable in both human and material\r\nterms. It was against the background of that heavy toll\r\nthat the Secretary-General drew the conclusion that the\r\nconsequences of those conflicts have seriously\r\nundermined Africa’s efforts to ensure long-term\r\nstability, prosperity and peace for its peoples. More\r\nimportantly, he admitted that preventing war — and, by\r\nimplication, conflict — in Africa was no longer a\r\nmatter of defending States but one of defending\r\nhumanity itself.\r\nThe need for peace and stability in Africa is\r\ntherefore as urgent today as it was in 1998, when the\r\nSecretary-General released his report on the sources of\r\nconflict on the continent. Now as then, Africa is mired\r\nin different conflicts of varied nature and intensity. We\r\nnote the positive reaction of the international\r\ncommunity to the Secretary-General’s report and the\r\npractical measures that have been taken to date in the\r\nquest for durable peace and sustainable development in\r\nAfrica. The latest report (A/57/172) indicates that\r\nprogress has been made in responding to conflict\r\nsituations through peacemaking, peacekeeping,\r\npreventive diplomacy and post-conflict peace-building.\r\nWe call on the United Nations to sustain the\r\nmomentum in promoting peace and development in\r\nAfrica as a matter of the utmost priority.\r\nAs we engage in this joint debate on the twin\r\nagenda issues of the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa and the final review and\r\nappraisal of UN-NADAF, we cannot but agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that good governance is a\r\nprerequisite for durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. As is aptly put in the report of the expert\r\npanel on the evaluation and review of UN-NADAF,\r\nconflict and development are mortal enemies.\r\nFor us in Nigeria, this statement resonates\r\nbecause it captures our experience as a country\r\ngrappling with the challenges of nation-building, socio-\r\neconomic development and the preservation and\r\npromotion of peace in Africa. The military in Nigeria\r\nhanded over power to a democratically elected\r\nGovernment only three and a half years ago, after 15\r\nyears in power. The restoration of civil rule has\r\nnecessitated a fresh start in the process of\r\ndemocratization.\r\nConsequently, the challenges of meeting\r\nheightened expectations after many years of\r\ndeprivation, ensuring participation and inclusiveness in\r\nthe process of governance, and striking a balance\r\nbetween national unity and stability have combined to\r\ntest our skills and capacities. Notwithstanding the\r\ncompeting demands for our lean resources, we have\r\ncontinued to be active participants in peacekeeping\r\noperations within and outside Africa. In West Africa\r\nalone, Nigeria spent over $10 billion on peacekeeping\r\noperations in Liberia and Sierra Leone.\r\nInternally, our efforts at development have\r\nyielded mixed results due to many factors. Instilling a\r\nculture of democracy, accountability, transparency and\r\ngood governance has not been an easy task.\r\nNonetheless, we affirm that democracy, the rule of law,\r\nhuman rights and respect for fundamental freedoms are\r\nessential for human intellect and human potential,\r\nwhich abound in our country, to flourish.\r\nIn an environment riddled with developmental\r\nproblems such as poverty, disease, ignorance and\r\nunemployment, the Government has had to make\r\ndeliberate choices in its programmes. Other inhibiting\r\nfactors include our excruciating external debt burden,\r\ndwindling commodity prices, lack of market access and\r\nlow productive capacity. Yet we realize that\r\ndevelopment is not an option; it is a necessity. Thus,\r\nour Government has concentrated on poverty\r\nalleviation, education, health, agriculture and the\r\nprovision of safe drinking water as its main priorities.\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nUN-NADAF was intended to help Africa\r\novercome the challenges of development. Indeed, the\r\nprogramme was derived from two previous\r\ninternational cooperation arrangements, namely\r\nAfrica’s Priority Programme for Economic Recovery\r\nand the United Nations Programme of Action for\r\nAfrican Economic Recovery and Development. The\r\ninternational community adopted the Programme to\r\naddress the multifarious social and economic problems\r\nthat confronted the continent in the mid-1980s,\r\nespecially the problems of pervasive poverty, infant\r\nmortality, disease and low economic growth.\r\nWe should also keep at the back of our minds the\r\nfact that the decade of UN-NADAF was also Africa’s\r\nmost trying decade in recent memory. It was the decade\r\nin which the continent, saddled with commitments and\r\nobligations arising from UN-NADAF, was embroiled in\r\nnumerous conflicts of catastrophic consequences.\r\nRegrettably, UN-NADAF did not deliver the much-\r\nneeded benefits it was designed to yield. Instead, its\r\nperformance has been judged to be very disappointing.\r\nIn the absence of the necessary political will and of the\r\nfulfilment of commitments by African leaders and their\r\ndevelopment partners, the pursuit of Africa’s\r\ndevelopment has remained elusive.\r\nThis final review and appraisal should therefore\r\noffer us an opportunity to reflect on the lessons learned\r\nfrom the implementation of UN-NADAF. We can also\r\ndraw from those lessons in charting a new course of\r\naction as we decide on the future engagement of the\r\nUnited Nations with Africa.\r\nOn 16 September, in this very Hall, a memorable\r\ndebate took place on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). The debate was later followed\r\nby that of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the\r\nAssembly on 25 and 26 September. On both occasions,\r\na central message emerged: that NEPAD was the\r\nappropriate framework through which the international\r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, should\r\nchannel its support for Africa. The principles and\r\nobjectives of NEPAD have been well articulated within\r\nthe United Nations in recent times and therefore need\r\nno reiteration here. Suffice it to say that the United\r\nNations system must lend its support to the Programme\r\nfor it to succeed.\r\nSupport for NEPAD must demonstrably be\r\nunconditional, qualitative and quantitative; it must be,\r\nat all levels, greater than that given to UN-NADAF. In\r\nthis connection, official development assistance flows,\r\nwhich declined in real terms in the 1990s, should be\r\nregular and predictable. Market access should be\r\nprovided in developed countries for African products.\r\nTransfer of technology on preferential and mutually\r\nagreed terms should be extended to African countries.\r\nAfrican Governments and the African people — male\r\nand female — should bear primary responsibility for\r\nthe implementation of NEPAD, as this is the only way\r\nto ensure and guarantee African ownership and\r\nleadership of the programme. But it will be necessary\r\nto allow each African country to evolve its own\r\ndevelopment strategy, based on objective socio-\r\neconomic realities and on the need to protect the most\r\nvulnerable members of society.\r\nTo further support NEPAD, there will also be a\r\nneed to inject new ideas into the consideration of the\r\nissue of Africa’s external debt. The dismal results of\r\nthe Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative, as shown during the review of UN-NADAF,\r\npoint to the inadequacy and limitations of the\r\nprogramme. Out of 33 African countries eligible for\r\nHIPC, only 18 reached “decision point”, and, of that\r\nnumber, only six made it through to “completion point”\r\nto qualify for debt cancellation as of April 2002. The\r\nimplication is that rescue programmes based on\r\nconditionalities are ineffective. Therefore, debt\r\ncancellation for all heavily indebted countries should\r\nform the basis of the support provided to African\r\ncountries.\r\nMore than anything, there is an urgent need for\r\nhuman development and capacity-building on the\r\ncontinent. The problem of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and\r\nof other debilitating diseases must be tackled head-on\r\nfor Africa to cast off its yoke of underdevelopment.\r\nHappily, these concerns, among others, form the\r\nbedrock of NEPAD’s objectives. NEPAD is an\r\nacknowledgement of the need for Africa to take its\r\ndestiny in its own hands and to assume responsibility\r\nfor the eradication of poverty. Collectively and\r\nindividually, African countries have pledged to resolve\r\nand prevent conflicts and to promote a culture of peace,\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nWhat is now required is for the international\r\ncommunity to join hands with Africa to help in\r\nrealizing the lofty objectives of NEPAD in a spirit of\r\ntrue partnership. The pledges of support already\r\nannounced by groups and individual countries are\r\ncommendable. In this respect, we sincerely hope that\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nthe ghost of UN-NADAF, commitments to which were\r\nnot fulfilled, will be laid to rest. We further urge that\r\nthe pledges announced be fulfilled without delay or\r\nencumbrances.\r\nNigeria welcomes the establishment of the\r\nSecurity Council Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict\r\nPrevention and Resolution in Africa, as well as the\r\nGeneral Assembly Ad Hoc Advisory Group on African\r\nCountries Emerging from Conflict. For these efforts to\r\nbe meaningful and their effects lasting, they must be\r\ncomplemented with a total ban on the trade and\r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons. Africa\r\ndesperately needs peace, and the international\r\ncommunity can help in fostering peace in the continent.\r\nWe note the decision of the Secretary General to\r\nstreamline and harmonize Africa-related reporting by\r\nthe United Nations system. However, we expect the\r\nSecretary- General to submit a detailed proposal on\r\nhow the United Nations would mobilize systemwide\r\nsupport as well as provide resources for the\r\nimplementation of NEPAD. There should be\r\ncoordination at both the regional and country levels to\r\nensure coherence and consistency. We in the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) have\r\nalready taken the lead in organizing this coordination,\r\nand other regions in Africa are doing the same. We\r\nwelcome the adoption by the General Assembly of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nas its framework policy programme for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa and as the successor to the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s. NEPAD adequately addresses the\r\npresent issues of concern to Africa and, if supported\r\nand effectively implemented, will finally lift the\r\ncontinent out of the throes of underdevelopment.\r\nAfrica will thus truly claim its place in the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The representative of Egypt this morning\r\nmade a statement on behalf of the African Group. My\r\ndelegation supports his statement. Allow me now to\r\nmake a statement on the two items before us.\r\nThis is the third time this session that the General\r\nAssembly has held joint debates on more than one\r\nagenda item. We thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nclear and comprehensive report (A/57/172) to the\r\nGeneral Assembly on the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations made five years ago in his report on\r\n“Causes of conflict and promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa”. We also wish to\r\nthank him for the report (A/57/156) on the detailed\r\nevaluation of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF) and\r\non the obstacles that hindered its implementation.\r\nWhen we discussed the situation in Africa in the\r\npast, it was said that all indicators projected that by\r\n2002, at the time of the final appraisal of UN-NADAF,\r\nwe would face challenges that would surpass what we\r\nfaced during its implementation. Indeed,\r\ndisappointment led some to say that political and\r\neconomical conditions would have deteriorated beyond\r\nall expectations.\r\nToday, however, as we review those conditions, it\r\nis quite clear that the situation is different. The\r\nSecretary-General has himself said that average\r\neconomic growth in Africa reached 3.1 per cent during\r\n2001, and that some African countries have attained a\r\ngrowth rate of more than 5 per cent. In the concluding\r\nobservations of one of his reports, he said that\r\n“progress has been made towards restoring peace\r\nand stability in the region. The peace process in\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea is being consolidated and the\r\nGreat Lakes region is showing signs of\r\nstability ... Angola ... is moving towards peace ...\r\nSierra Leone, had its successful elections ...\r\nrestoring democracy in that country” (A/57/172,\r\npara. 43)\r\nWe are happy with these positive developments\r\nand with the peace efforts that have come from African\r\ninitiatives: from Sirte, Lusaka, Algiers, Pretoria and\r\nother cities. This testifies to a fact that has been widely\r\nrepeated: only Africans can make a difference in\r\nAfrica.\r\nIt is only fair to say that the United Nations has\r\nmade significant contributions solving the problems\r\nthat are affecting Africa. The Secretary-General has\r\nnamed envoys to facilitate the settlement and\r\nmanagement of disputes and to foster dialogue between\r\nparties in conflict. The United Nations also continues\r\nits peace efforts in the Republic of Central Africa and\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are happy\r\nthat the Secretary-General has appointed a Special\r\nRepresentative for West Africa in support of efforts\r\naimed at the establishment of peace and stability.\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nAfrican problems have received considerable\r\nattention in the General Assembly, in the Security\r\nCouncil and in the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nalso recall the efforts of other organizations, such as\r\nthe International Labour Organization, the United\r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees, addressing the needs and the repatriation\r\nof women and children. We should also mention the\r\nFood and Agricultural Organization of the United\r\nNations, which has helped in the reintegration of\r\ncombatants in African countries that were afflicted by\r\nconflict.\r\nThese success stories are very encouraging.\r\nHowever, progress in other fields has been quite\r\nlimited and as the Secretary-General said in paragraph\r\n44 of document A/57/172, the growth rate that Africa\r\nhas achieved falls short of the 7 per cent necessary to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving\r\npoverty by 2015. The AIDS epidemic is one of the\r\nmain obstacles to development and causes the death of\r\none million people annually, mostly children. During\r\nthe 1990s, the economic environment was not\r\nconducive to sustainable development. External debt\r\nand debt servicing devoured most of Africa’s already\r\nscarce resources. Official development assistance\r\ncontinued to fall while trade barriers and high tariffs\r\nmade it difficult for African products to reach\r\ninternational markets, especially those of the developed\r\ncountries.\r\nAfrica has proved that it is strongly committed to\r\nachieving peace and sustainable development. This is\r\nattested to by the establishment of the African Union\r\nwhich aims to unify the continent, put an end to\r\nhotbeds of tension, combat hunger, poverty and AIDS,\r\nand remove the effects of colonialism, which drained\r\nthe resources and wealth of those countries. The\r\nAfrican Union also aims to formulate strategies that\r\nwill carry the people of Africa from underdevelopment\r\nand weakness to stability and strength.\r\nWe highly appreciate the efforts of the United\r\nNations, the Secretary-General and United Nations\r\nagencies in supporting Africa in the fields of health,\r\neducation, information technology. We call on the other\r\npartners to play the role required of them: those who\r\ncommitted themselves to Africa’s development and\r\npledged to contribute needed medicines and vaccines at\r\naffordable prices to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria. Africa needs barriers to its exports removed,\r\nas well as assistance in overcoming the problem of\r\nexternal debt and a commitment to meet the agreed\r\ntarget for official development assistance. There is also\r\na need for more investment and an increased share in\r\ninternational trade, as well as for active participation in\r\ndecision-making in international financial and\r\neconomic forums.\r\nOne month ago, the Assembly adopted the\r\nsignificant United Nations Declaration (resolution\r\n57/2) on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). That was another commitment by the\r\ninternational community to respond to the needs of the\r\ncontinent, in keeping with the Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe are satisfied with that. However, the partnership\r\nshould be real and effective, and it must respect the\r\nwill, history, culture and values of the Africans and\r\navoid imposing conditionalities or political terms that\r\nrun counter to the particular characteristics of Africa.\r\nOur partners should realize that their\r\ncontributions also benefit their own societies. A halt to\r\nour decrease in migration through legislative or\r\nadministrative measures would encourage Africans to\r\nremain on their continent, and thus to work for their\r\nown betterment. We believe that this can be achieved\r\nthrough the following measures: Giving priority to\r\nbasic infrastructures, such as transportation and\r\ncommunication; focusing on water projects so that\r\nAfricans can improve their agricultural production;\r\nhalting restrictions on the transfer of technology and\r\nencouraging its indigenization; taking into account the\r\nsuffering of Africans in the past centuries and the\r\ndepletion and pillage of their resources; and addressing\r\nthe very serious problem of the brain drain that is\r\naffecting the human resources of the continent to the\r\nbenefit of the developed countries.\r\nThe Secretary-General has said that Africa is at a\r\nturning point. He is right, and that is why we have\r\nestablished the African Union. We have started on the\r\npath to development. We are trying to rid ourselves of\r\nall conflicts. This is an opportunity for the United\r\nNations and the international community to help Africa\r\nreinforce peace and development in all its regions. Not\r\nachieving that would be a moral and political failure\r\nfor the Organization, as well as for the entire\r\ninternational community. It is a challenge that we must\r\nall face together.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nMs. Wijono (Indonesia): On behalf of the\r\nIndonesian delegation, I would like to extend our\r\nheartfelt appreciation to the President for his able\r\nstewardship and guidance during the course of this\r\nsession. I would also like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the reports that frame our deliberation.\r\nIndonesia subscribes to the view that the causes\r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa are closely linked to\r\nthe prevalence of poverty on that continent. While the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General (A/57/172) provides\r\nupdates on progress in peacemaking, peace-building\r\nand reconstruction in Africa, Indonesia is convinced\r\nthat only efforts to enhance the development of Africa\r\ncan bring poverty under control, thereby eliminating\r\nthe key cause of conflict.\r\nIndonesia welcomes the progress achieved in\r\naddressing the causes of conflict and in promoting\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa,\r\nas described in the Secretary-General’s report. In\r\nparticular, Indonesia encourages the efforts by some\r\nAfrican countries to reduce their military expenditure\r\nand supports the target of reducing expenditures on\r\narms to less than 1.5 per cent of Gross Domestic\r\nProduct, while attaining zero growth in military\r\nexpenditures. In our view, war consumes and destroys\r\nresources already in place, and thus we believe that\r\nachieving such a target would facilitate the allocation\r\nof a larger share of national budgets to sustainable\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nIndonesia attaches great importance to emergency\r\nassistance from the international community for post-\r\nconflict reconstruction and development in Africa. The\r\nestablishment of the United Nations Consolidated\r\nAppeals Process as a strategic planning tool for the\r\npromotion of transition from relief to development is a\r\nwelcome initiative. While recognizing the important\r\nrole that African countries themselves must play, we\r\nencourage the continued contribution of the\r\ninternational community, through the United Nations\r\nand its agencies, to the promotion of peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nIndonesia emphasizes the important role that\r\npeace-friendly structural adjustment programmes can\r\nplay. Indonesia supports the suggestion made by the\r\nSecretary-General that in providing those programmes,\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions should consider more\r\nflexible and effective measures which include the\r\nrelaxing of some of the stringent conditionalities\r\nconcerning economic performance, scaling up post-\r\nconflict funding, special assistance for reconstruction\r\nand poverty reduction interventions.\r\nIndonesia also lauds the voluntary establishment\r\nby African leaders of the African Peer Review\r\nMechanism to monitor progress in compliance with the\r\nhigh standards of good governance that have been set.\r\nThat stands as testimony to the sincerity and\r\ncommitment of African leaders in achieving peace for\r\ntheir people.\r\nIn addition to peace and security, there are other\r\nchallenges to sustainable development in Africa. Those\r\nare financial constraints, market access problems, lack\r\nof information and communication technologies, issues\r\nof developing human capital and economic\r\ndiversification, as well as infrastructure development.\r\nIn recognition of the link between peace and\r\nsustainable development, the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which we joined in\r\nwelcoming here during the high-level plenary meeting\r\nof the General Assembly last month, has strong\r\npotential to contribute to the realization of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa.\r\nEmphasizing peace, security, democracy, good\r\ngovernance, respect for human rights and sound\r\neconomic management as preconditions for sustainable\r\ndevelopment, NEPAD now embodies Africa’s\r\ncommitment to its own peaceful development and\r\nrepresents the policy framework within which the\r\ninternational community, including the United Nations\r\nsystem, should focus its efforts to assist Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. It is my sincerest desire that this new\r\ninitiative should meet with success, since failure would\r\nmean failure for us all in achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals to which we are all pledged.\r\nIn the context of achieving the objectives of\r\nNEPAD, we should recall the experience of\r\nimplementing the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF),\r\nwhich was launched in 1991. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report points out, UN-NADAF was at best a\r\nlimited success. Its lack of progress was attributable to\r\nall the actors involved, both African countries and the\r\ninternational community.\r\nA critical impediment to success was the cookie-\r\ncutter approach to achieving development over a vastly\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\ndiverse group of countries. The mantra of “liberalize\r\nand privatize” without regard to the unique\r\ncircumstances that prevail in any given country proved\r\nto be a canard. Therefore, national ownership of the\r\ndevelopment process is essential for fundamental\r\nchange to occur. Local institutions are best suited to\r\nsatisfy local needs while maintaining local values.\r\nNEPAD clearly emphasizes national ownership of the\r\ndevelopment process; Indonesia welcomes that the\r\ninternational community is coming to accept that\r\nprincipal as critical to the success of the development\r\nprocess.\r\nAnother impediment was the failure of the parties\r\nto live up to their commitments. African countries\r\nnever completely implemented the UN-NADAF\r\nprogramme, while official development assistance to\r\nAfrica actually declined after the programme’s launch.\r\nLittle progress was made on market access for\r\nAfrican exports or debt relief for the poorest nations.\r\nMoreover, the programme was marred by a general\r\nlack of quantifiable objectives and targets for\r\nmonitoring progress and compliance, this being one of\r\nthe reasons for the limited success. Indonesia\r\nrecognizes the importance of monitoring\r\nimplementation of NEPAD, not only at the national\r\nlevel but also at the international level.\r\nOne area that UN-NADAF did not address was\r\nmodern information and communications technologies,\r\nmainly the Internet. Since this new technology was\r\nlargely unknown in 1991, this was not a failure of the\r\nUN-NADAF initiative, perhaps. But as of now, Africa\r\nis the least connected region in the world, with the\r\nlowest computer use, which results in many\r\nopportunities being squandered. We are particularly\r\nhappy to learn that NEPAD has targeted information\r\nand communications technology as a priority area for\r\ndevelopment, and therefore efforts to assist Africa to\r\nbridge the digital divide for development should be\r\nencouraged.\r\nHuman, physical and financial capital is in short\r\nsupply in Africa, but in fact there is a considerable\r\nsupply of domestic entrepreneurial talent. Sixty to 70\r\nper cent of employment in Africa is generated by\r\nmicro-, small- and medium-size enterprises. However,\r\na shortage of finance and a lack of connectivity prevent\r\nthose smaller African firms from expanding regionally\r\nand globally as have many similar firms in other\r\nregions. Internet access could help promote African\r\nindustry and exports and, conversely, help open Africa\r\nas a market for exports from other regions.\r\nIn evaluating UN-NADAF’s failures in order to\r\nensure NEPAD’s success, it should be remembered that\r\nUN-NADAF failed for a variety of reasons. Peace and\r\nsecurity are the highest goals of the United Nations and\r\nthey should be so for NEPAD, as the elusive goal of\r\ndevelopment becomes ever more slippery without\r\npeace. Adequate financing is necessary to bring about\r\ndevelopment, but it is not sufficient without supporting\r\npolices from both African countries and the\r\ninternational community. The aftermath of the\r\nMonterrey Conference and the Johannesburg Summit\r\nhas left the international community with a surplus of\r\ngoodwill. Let us not repeat the failures of the past, but\r\nrather capitalize on the goodwill of the present by\r\nturning it into action for the future.\r\nMr. Mizukami (Japan): The United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF) will come to a formal conclusion during\r\nthe current session of the General Assembly. From now\r\non, support for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) will be the main item on the\r\nagenda. In that context, I should like to state once\r\nagain that Japan welcomes NEPAD as an expression of\r\nAfrica’s ownership.\r\nWe also welcome the joint debate being held\r\ntoday under agenda item 33, on causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa, and under agenda item 41 (a),\r\non final review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF). Such an exercise\r\ncan help to streamline agendas and possibly contribute\r\nto reform of the General Assembly.\r\nOwnership and partnership — the very heart of\r\nNEPAD — are principles that my Government has\r\nstressed through the process of the Tokyo International\r\nConference on African Development. Japan firmly\r\nbelieves that ownership by African countries plays a\r\ncritical role in their development. Accordingly, Japan\r\nwill continue to provide support to NEPAD, and we\r\nwill host the Third Tokyo International Conference on\r\nAfrican Development next October.\r\nWe also welcome the recognition by African\r\ncountries that conflict prevention, management and\r\nresolution; peace enforcement and peacekeeping; post-\r\nconflict reconciliation, rehabilitation and\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nreconstruction; and disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration (DDR) are preconditions for\r\ndevelopment. In that connection, I should like to take\r\nthis opportunity to discuss the issue of conflict\r\nresolution and peace-building.\r\nDespite tremendous efforts on the part of African\r\ncountries themselves, with cooperation from the\r\ninternational community, they continue to be\r\nconfronted with problems that threaten peace and\r\nstability in their own countries as well as in the region.\r\nThat is especially true in countries that are emerging\r\nfrom conflict, since, in many cases, the underlying\r\ncauses of conflict — such as poverty — remain after\r\nthe conflict itself has been settled. Countries in that\r\nsituation all too often fall into a vicious cycle of\r\nrecurring conflict and fail to achieve significant\r\ndevelopment progress.\r\nIn addressing conflict resolution and peace-\r\nbuilding in Africa, Japan has repeatedly stressed the\r\nimportance of taking a comprehensive approach that\r\nintegrates political, economic, social and humanitarian\r\nmeasures to achieve lasting peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Needless to say, ensuring cooperation\r\nand coordination among various actors is essential to\r\nthe success of such a comprehensive approach. Such an\r\napproach should be followed at all stages, from conflict\r\nprevention to post-conflict peace-building. Thanks to\r\nthe efforts of African countries — as well as to those of\r\nAfrican regional and subregional organizations, of the\r\nUnited Nations and of other international partners —\r\nprogress has been achieved in the peace processes in\r\nAngola, in Ethiopia and Eritrea and in Sierra Leone.\r\nHowever, durable peace and sustainable development\r\nin a post-conflict situation can be achieved only\r\nthrough measures undertaken in the context of a\r\ncomprehensive approach.\r\nBeing of that view, Japan has responded to\r\nconflicts in Africa by extending assistance to\r\nencourage the peace process, to promote DDR and to\r\nachieve a seamless transition from conflict resolution\r\nto post-conflict reconstruction and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. We remain committed to such efforts.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress our\r\nwholehearted commitment to Africa as a partner. Japan\r\nwill engage actively and continuously in the NEPAD\r\nprocess, and we will support the efforts of African\r\nnations.\r\nMr. Jalang’o (Kenya): At the outset, my\r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made\r\nthis morning by the delegation of Egypt on behalf of\r\nthe African Group.\r\nIn addition, on behalf of the Government of\r\nKenya, I should like to express our condolences to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Indonesia following the\r\nhorrific terrorist attack on the island of Bali last week.\r\nWe also express our condolences to the Government\r\nand the people of Australia, who were equally affected\r\nby the attack.\r\nLet me take this early opportunity to express my\r\ndelegation’s commendations of the able manner in\r\nwhich the President of the General Assembly has\r\ncontinued to steer the deliberations concerning this\r\nagenda item, on final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).\r\nMy delegation would also like to express its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncommitment with regard to the final review of UN-\r\nNADAF.\r\nUN-NADAF was an outstanding effort that\r\nconscientiously reflected on the issues related to\r\nsustainable development of the African continent. It\r\nfully recognized the essential elements that would\r\npropel Africa to desirable levels of economic\r\ndevelopment. It is, however, disappointing that, for\r\nmuch of the decade, the development targets were not\r\nachieved. Much of that failure has been attributed to\r\nthe decline in external support, as official development\r\nassistance to Africa declined from $28.62 billion in\r\n1990 to $16.38 billion in 2000. In addition, the Heavily\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative has not yielded\r\nthe desired results. Kenya, therefore, calls for a review\r\nof the eligibility criteria to enable more countries to\r\nbenefit from the Initiative. At the same time, trade\r\nopportunities have not delivered the expected benefits\r\nas a result of the deteriorating terms of trade and the\r\nresultant decline in export earnings.\r\nDespite that bleak scenario, my delegation is\r\nconfident that much hope still exists for the continent\r\nin realizing sustainable development. African\r\nGovernments have adopted various measures, at both\r\nthe national and the regional levels, to promote\r\neconomic development. The economic and political\r\nreforms undertaken in the 1990s, for example, have\r\nhelped to improve the macro-economic situation in\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nmost countries, while significant strides have been\r\nmade in the process of democratization.\r\nThe continent has demonstrated its commitments\r\nto economic cooperation and integration through\r\nregional bodies such as the Common Market for\r\nEastern and Southern Africa, the East African\r\nCommunity, the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity and the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States, which are building blocks of the\r\neconomic integration of the African continent. The\r\nrecent launching of the African Union in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa, was clear testimony to that effort. We\r\nwould like to call upon the international to support us\r\nin that endeavour.\r\nMy delegation shares the philosophy of the\r\neminent panellists on the evaluation of UN-NADAF\r\nthat the first and foremost lesson from that decade-long\r\nexperience has been that conflict and development are\r\nmortal enemies. At its fifty-fifth session, the General\r\nAssembly, in resolution 55/217, reaffirmed the close\r\nlinkage between peace, security and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, and emphasized the need for a\r\ncomprehensive implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport of April 1998 on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa (A/52/871).\r\nKenya welcomes the efforts of the United Nations\r\naimed at fostering global peace, security and stability\r\nthrough cooperation with regional and subregional\r\ngrouping arrangements. We welcome the growing\r\noptimism concerning the progress made in the\r\nnegotiations to settle long-standing conflicts in the\r\nHorn of Africa and the Great Lakes region. Kenya will\r\ncontinue to spearhead efforts to resolve the conflicts in\r\nour subregion, and I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto inform the Assembly that the peace conference on\r\nSomalia began on Tuesday, 15 October, in Eldoret,\r\nKenya, and brought together all the political factions,\r\nmembers of civil society and other stakeholders. We\r\nare hopeful that the warring parties in Somalia will\r\nfinally agree to form a Government of national unity.\r\nAt the same time, Kenya welcomes the signing of\r\na truce for the cessation of fighting between the\r\nGovernment of the Sudan and the Southern Sudan\r\nPeople’s Liberation Movement, and the resumption of\r\npeace talks in the Kenyan town of Machakos. Our\r\ndetermination in supporting those peace efforts is\r\npredicated on the clear understanding that the\r\nresolution of those conflicts holds the key to Africa’s\r\nsustainable development and prosperity.\r\nThe launching of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) by African heads of\r\nState or Government in July 2001 was a significant\r\nevent, as it set out a broad vision of the continent and a\r\nstrategy for achieving sustainable development. We\r\nwelcome the support and seek the endorsement of that\r\ninitiative by the international community, including the\r\nUnited Nations system. NEPAD provides a\r\ncomprehensive framework for support to Africa, and\r\nwe welcome the recommendation that the New\r\nPartnership be adopted by the United Nations system\r\nand the international community as the framework for\r\nits future support to Africa. Kenya believes that the\r\nsuccess of NEPAD will ultimately depend on the\r\nefforts of Africans with the support of our development\r\npartners, bearing in mind the principles of ownership\r\nand partnership.\r\nFinally, the primary responsibility for the\r\ndevelopment of Africa remains with African countries\r\nthemselves, and the international community has a role\r\nto play in that respect. The United Nations system, as\r\nwell as other development partners, including\r\ninternational financial institutions, must ensure that\r\ndevelopment assistance activities in Africa are carried\r\nout in a more coordinated manner in order to make a\r\ntangible impact on the recipient countries.\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan): We believe that Africa\r\nmust move forward and look ahead towards the future.\r\nIn that context, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is a manifestation of the strong\r\ndetermination of African countries to better the lot of\r\ntheir peoples. That worthy desire has stemmed from the\r\ninnate wisdom of Africa’s leaders. It is an expression\r\nof its people’s wish to cast aside civil and regional\r\nconflicts and bloody power struggles that bring only\r\nmisery and destruction; and above all, it demonstrates\r\nthe ultimate supremacy of the people in shaping their\r\ndestinies.\r\nWe warmly congratulate the people of Africa and\r\ntheir leaders on the bold decisions being taken. In their\r\npursuit of the objectives of NEPAD, African countries\r\nneed and must receive the full and unstinting\r\ncooperation of the international community. That is\r\nmore so because the moral commitment of the\r\ndeveloped countries, the Bretton Woods institutions\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nand the rest of international community is in fact\r\nalready there and has been explicitly given.\r\nAs has been reiterated by many speakers in this\r\nAssembly, the beginning of the new millennium was\r\ncrowned by the far-sighted and overarching decisions\r\nof our leaders at the Millennium Summit. Thereafter,\r\nimplementation of international decisions acquired\r\nprominence and was highlighted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. That was done at the Monterrey, Doha and\r\nJohannesburg Conferences, among other forums. The\r\nNEPAD initiative is a focused framework in pursuit of\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals for one of the most\r\nmarginalized areas of the world. It is pertinent to note\r\nthat out of the 49 least developed countries, 34 are in\r\nAfrica.\r\nOur experience in international cooperation,\r\nespecially when it comes to socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, has raised the question of who decides\r\nwhat is to be done in a country or a region. Again, who\r\nare the owners of the process? While discussions and\r\ndialogue are essential between donors and recipients,\r\nand while expatriate advisers and consultants have\r\ntheir important roles to play, the ownership of\r\ndevelopment projects and programmes should lie with\r\nthe Governments and the people that they are expected\r\nto benefit. That approach is important if development\r\nprogrammes are to have a lasting impact in recipient\r\ncountries. That is an integral principle of NEPAD, and\r\nwe must respect it.\r\nWhen it comes to the least developed countries,\r\nmy delegation has consistently pointed out that official\r\ndevelopment assistance has to continue to play an\r\nimportant role. That is especially so with regard to\r\nbuilding transportation and communications\r\ninfrastructure, as well as basic health and educational\r\nservices. Loans become a viable option only when they\r\nare an input into income-generating programmes and\r\nprojects that enable repayment, or when the country\r\nconcerned is in a position to pay them back from other\r\nsources of income. If that consideration is ignored, then\r\nthe result will be indebtedness.\r\nForeign direct investment is an important element\r\nin financing development for the advancement of\r\nprivate enterprise, the acquisition of technology and the\r\nexpansion of trade, as well as for increasing\r\nemployment and income levels.\r\nBut the definitive problem for developing\r\ncountries, and especially for the least developed\r\ncountries, is how to attract foreign direct investment.\r\nAs is well known, private investment moves to\r\ncountries where profitability can be maximized.\r\nUnfortunately, circumstances in the least developed\r\ncountries do not always attract private investment,\r\ndespite their best efforts. Infrastructure and\r\ncommunications facilities, an educated and technically\r\ntrained manpower and peace and stability are important\r\nrequirements.\r\nTo develop and establish those conditions, least\r\ndeveloped countries need official development\r\nassistance to supplement domestic resources. For the\r\nfinancing of development, we must move with greater\r\nhaste and purpose to fulfil the commitments made at\r\nMonterrey. The spirit of Monterrey needs to be fired to\r\nmeet the goals of the Millennium Summit. Financing\r\nhas to be available to implement decisions of the\r\ninternational community. This is what the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development now needs. We\r\nhope that, this time, the international community will\r\nmeet the challenge.\r\nMr. Cheah (Malaysia): My delegation welcomes\r\nthe Secretary-General’s progress report on the causes\r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/57/172). We also\r\nwelcome his reports on the independent evaluation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s (NEPAD) (A/57/156) and on the\r\nreview and implementation of the programme for\r\nSecond Industrial Development Decade for Africa\r\n(A/57/175). The deliberation of all three of those\r\nreports today underscores the importance that this body\r\nis continuing to attach to the development and well-\r\nbeing of Africa.\r\nWe all agree that Africa faces myriad and\r\ncomplex issues, which must be dealt with in a\r\ncomprehensive, integrated and coordinated manner.\r\nAfrica’s numerous wars have not only resulted in\r\nwidespread destruction and loss of life, but have also\r\ncontributed to creating millions of internally displaced\r\npersons and over nine million refugees. Malaysia\r\ntherefore views with trepidation the ongoing military\r\nrebellion that has now enveloped Côte d’Ivoire, a\r\ncountry considered by many to be a bastion of stability\r\nand prosperity in West Africa. It is our hope that the\r\nconflict that began on 19 September will not be\r\nprolonged to the detriment of its populace, in\r\nparticular, and the whole West African region, in\r\ngeneral.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nWe are, however, heartened by recent\r\npeacemaking efforts in both the Sudan and Somalia.\r\nWe hope those efforts will be successful. We applaud\r\nAfrica’s own efforts at establishing the appropriate\r\nmechanisms for the prevention, management and\r\nresolution of conflicts at both the regional and\r\nsubregional levels. Regional and subregional\r\norganizations have an important role to play in\r\npreventive diplomacy and in the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, especially in the context of the ongoing\r\nconflicts in Africa. In that connection, due recognition\r\nmust be given to the important roles being played by\r\nthe African Union, the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS), the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community and the Intergovernmental\r\nAuthority on Development, among others.\r\nWe have noted that, in his latest report, the\r\nSecretary-General has continued to stress the important\r\nlinkage between peace and development. In the\r\nabsence of political stability, which is essential for\r\nattracting foreign investment and capital, the countries\r\nof Africa will find it difficult to embark on any serious\r\ndevelopment programmes. Where stability has been\r\nrestored in conflict areas, the processes of\r\npeacemaking, peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding have engendered sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment and economic growth.\r\nHowever, the continent still lags behind the target\r\nof 6 per cent growth in gross national product per\r\nannum, as set by the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s. Although 15\r\nAfrican countries achieved growth rates of over 5 per\r\ncent, that still falls short of the 7 per cent annual\r\ngrowth rate necessary to achieve the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal of reducing poverty by half by the\r\nyear 2015.\r\nInternational cooperation and assistance are\r\nimperative if Africa is to recover and set its course on\r\nthe path towards development. More needs to be done\r\nby developed countries in providing financial\r\nresources, better market access and reducing trade\r\nbarriers to African exports. The continent accounts for\r\njust 1 per cent of world trade, although it is home to 10\r\nper cent of the world’s population and 30 per cent of its\r\nnatural resources.\r\nNo less important is the crippling external debt\r\nstill faced by many African countries, servicing of\r\nwhich accounts for a third of those countries’ export\r\nearnings. All that debt will impede public investment\r\nin physical infrastructure and human resource\r\ndevelopment. We welcome the efforts at\r\ncomprehensive debt relief currently being\r\nimplemented, including through the Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC), whereby poor\r\ncountries with unsustainable debt burdens are provided\r\nwith coordinated debt relief. It is encouraging to note\r\nthat 23 African countries are currently receiving relief\r\nfrom HIPC.\r\nAfrican Governments must give due\r\nconsideration to reducing their defence budgets, in\r\nparticular as they relate to arms purchases. In that\r\nregard, we applaud the effort of ECOWAS to renew the\r\nMoratorium on the Importation, Exportation and\r\nManufacture of Small Arms and Light Weapons in\r\nWest Africa. Additional concerted efforts are also\r\nneeded to encourage more African countries to\r\nparticipate in the United Nations Register of\r\nConventional Arms. The substantial amounts spent\r\nannually on arms purchases could be better utilized for\r\nmore productive purposes, such as investing in\r\neducation and health and promoting economic growth,\r\nwhich are essential factors in poverty reduction. At the\r\nsame time, the importance of ongoing democratization\r\nprocesses, good governance and sustainable\r\ndevelopment cannot be underestimated as prerequisites\r\nfor durable peace and the promotion of economic\r\ngrowth. We welcome the initiative of African countries\r\nto establish an African Peer Review Mechanism to\r\ntrack the progress made in financial transparency,\r\naccountability, protecting the integrity of monetary\r\nsystems and strengthening banking and financial\r\nstandards so as to improve governance and the\r\neconomic management of African countries.\r\nAs we have declared in this body, Malaysia views\r\nNEPAD as a bold undertaking to halt the\r\nmarginalization of Africa from the process of\r\nglobalization and to assist its integration into the world\r\neconomy. African countries must be the stakeholders in\r\ntheir development programmes, in partnership with\r\ninternational agencies. We believe that NEPAD is a\r\nreflection of the commitment of African leaders to\r\nbuild a strong and enduring culture of democracy,\r\nrespect for human rights and sustained economic\r\ngrowth on the continent. But Africa cannot do it alone.\r\nAfrica needs concrete support from the international\r\ncommunity if it is to meet the Millennium Declaration\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nGoals of sustainable development and poverty\r\nreduction.\r\nWhile the international community, in general,\r\nand the Plan of Action for Africa adopted by the Group\r\nof Eight industrialized countries in June 2002, in\r\nparticular, have expressed support for NEPAD, donors’\r\nfinancial resources and attention could be diverted in\r\nthe light of the growing possibility of United States\r\nmilitary action against Iraq. That possibility and the\r\nweakening global economy are factors that could\r\nimpede the realization of NEPAD.\r\nAs for Malaysia, I wish to reiterate that we value\r\nour traditional close and friendly ties with Africa. We\r\nare especially proud of our long-standing bonds of\r\nfriendship and cooperation with many African\r\ncountries, and we look forward to further consolidating\r\nthat cooperation and solidarity in more concrete ways.\r\nMalaysia, with its limited resources, will continue to\r\nplay its modest role in enhancing cooperation with\r\nAfrican countries through its training programmes.\r\nIt is in that regard that Malaysia, in the spirit of\r\nSouth-South cooperation, extended the Malaysian\r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme in 1981 to cover\r\nAfrican countries. To date, more than 4,000\r\nparticipants, including participants from Africa, have\r\nundergone various short- and medium-term training\r\ncourses in public administration and technical fields in\r\nvarious Malaysian institutions. We will also continue to\r\nexchange views and to engage with our African\r\npartners in finding ways and means to enhance our\r\ncooperation and partnership programmes, including\r\nthrough the Langkawi International Dialogue. In our\r\nrelationship with Africa, we have made efforts to\r\nenhance the level of cooperation through the concept of\r\n“smart partnerships” - that is, partnerships between\r\nGovernments and private sectors with the goal of\r\npromoting better and sustainable economic activities to\r\nensure a win-win relationship.\r\nMalaysia is ever mindful of the humanitarian\r\nneeds of our African friends, and we have assisted\r\nthem in whatever way we can. In that regard, Malaysia\r\nwill be contributing $100,000 to alleviate the grave\r\nfood shortage situation in Southern Africa.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco) (spoke in French):\r\nFirst of all, I should like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, on his report (A/57/172),\r\nwhich describes specific follow-up measures\r\nundertaken with regard to the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations contained in his very important\r\nreport of 1998 (A/52/871) on the causes of conflict and\r\nthe promotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nThe Moroccan delegation welcomes the positive\r\nassessment made by the Secretary-General in that\r\nreport, which highlights new progress achieved in an\r\narray of activities, and it is the report’s positive aspects\r\nthat I shall address first.\r\nFirst, with regard to Angola, we were all pleased\r\nto see that brotherly country find peace and stability,\r\nafter years and decades of conflict, which will enable it\r\nto devote itself to economic and social development.\r\nThat is also the case with the fratricidal conflict\r\nbetween Eritrea and Ethiopia, which has been\r\nstabilized thanks to the decision of the Boundary\r\nCommission, accepted by both parties, to definitively\r\ndetermine the border. And it is finally the case —\r\nalthough there is still progress to be made — with the\r\nconflict that unfortunately is taking place in the\r\ncountries of the Mano River region, which we hope\r\nwill move further towards the restoration of confidence\r\nand of a civil peace among them.\r\nThe history of conflicts shows us that every time\r\nthe ethnic factor has been used by one or several\r\nactors, it can generate conflict, but also that, if it allows\r\nfor cross-border cooperation, it can guide the countries\r\nin question towards stability and lasting cooperation.\r\nThat is why, in conflicts — whether internal or\r\ninternationalized — there is an interaction between\r\nrespect for fundamental human rights and minority\r\nrights and the restoration of regional peace and\r\ndevelopment. We should bear that approach in mind. It\r\nhas proved useful in many parts of the world,\r\nparticularly in Europe after the end of the cold war.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco remains convinced that\r\nthe development of regional and subregional\r\ncooperation is the principal factor in preventing the\r\nworsening of rivalry and ethnic conflict and that it is\r\nthe most effective means of transcending potential or\r\nreal conflict situations. That clearly applies to Africa\r\nfirst and foremost, because, as everyone knows, Africa\r\nhas inherited the aftermath of colonialism, most often\r\nwith artificial borders that were drawn arbitrarily. That\r\nis why my delegation shares the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that subregional and regional cooperation and\r\neconomic integration in Africa can strengthen\r\nconfidence among neighbouring countries and, as a\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nresult, should allow us to establish solid bases for\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, anxious to respect and\r\nto enhance good-neighbourly relations, is resolved to\r\ncontinue to commit itself to any action that promotes\r\nthe well-being of the peoples of the Maghreb region.\r\nWe hope that their stability and prosperity will benefit\r\nthe entire African continent, because we are the\r\ncrossroads of Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. The\r\nprogress achieved thus far towards the restoration of\r\npeace in certain regions of Africa — even if its effects\r\nhave not yet been felt — demonstrates the effectiveness\r\nof the approach taken by the United Nations. The\r\nSecretary-General’s appointment of special mediators\r\nand the creation of special Commissions charged with\r\nexamining the sources of disputes are measures that\r\ndeserve support.\r\nSimilarly, the past year has seen the success of\r\ntwo African initiatives that we strongly supported in\r\ndue course: the establishment of a Regional Office for\r\nWest Africa, which is now up and running; and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council’s adoption of a\r\nresolution providing for the establishment of an Ad\r\nHoc Advisory Group for African countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict. Again, we supported that initiative in\r\ndue course. The establishment of the Regional Office,\r\nas I said, will certainly enable us to foster peace in the\r\nMano River region and in West Africa. In addition, the\r\nAd Hoc Advisory Groups — the first of which was\r\nestablished for Guinea-Bissau — will help the\r\ncountries concerned to heal their wounds and to emerge\r\nfrom the horrors of the conflicts that they have\r\nendured.\r\nWe have heard several times here that the\r\ncountries that have experienced so much suffering and\r\nare so backward cannot make progress themselves;\r\nthey need substantial international assistance, and that\r\nis the Organization’s role — to give them that\r\nassistance. Such assistance consists of peace-building,\r\nof course, but also of addressing the return of refugees\r\nand displaced persons.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco will continue its\r\nsolidarity with all of its African brothers, and it will\r\nspare no effort to advance the cause of peace on the\r\nAfrican continent, and particularly in a region that is\r\nsimply the extension of Morocco — West Africa —\r\nwhere we hope to be as active as possible for the\r\nrestoration of lasting peace. We hope in particular that,\r\nby the end of October or the beginning of November, a\r\nsecond summit of the Mano river countries will be held\r\nat Rabat under the auspices of His Majesty King\r\nMohammed VI.\r\nMs. Løj (Denmark): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). The Central and\r\nEastern European countries associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Association countries of the European\r\nEconomic Area Iceland and Norway, align themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\nAfrica has been given high priority on the agenda\r\nof this year’s General Assembly session, and rightly so.\r\nThe birth of the African Union (AU), the consolidation\r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) and the recent positive prospects of ending\r\nsome of Africa’s protracted conflicts — in Angola, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and\r\nEritrea, Sierra Leone and the Sudan — are notable\r\npolitical developments that could augur well for the\r\nfuture of the African continent and its peoples.\r\nHere at the United Nations, we have already been\r\nable to engage in substantive discussions of the\r\nchallenges and opportunities facing Africa. The high-\r\nlevel plenary meeting on 16 September on the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and the ensuing\r\nreview of the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF)\r\nclearly underlined the magnitude of the development\r\nchallenges facing Africa. They also reaffirmed the need\r\nfor a concerted effort by the international community\r\nto lend its full support to assisting African efforts to\r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nLet me begin by commenting briefly on the\r\nrecently concluded review of UN-NADAF. The\r\nEuropean Union is pleased with the outcome of the\r\nnegotiations in the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole.\r\nWe have drawn lessons from UN-NADAF that will be\r\napplied to the implementation of NEPAD and the\r\norganization of future support by the United Nations\r\nsystem for NEPAD. First of all, we firmly established\r\nNEPAD as the future framework around which the\r\ninternational community, including the United Nations\r\nsystem, should concentrate its efforts for Africa’s\r\ndevelopment. Secondly, we called upon the United\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nNations system to ensure a coherent response in\r\nsupport of the implementation of NEPAD at country\r\nlevel. Finally, we agreed to include a single\r\ncomprehensive item on the development of Africa on\r\nthe annual agenda of the General Assembly.\r\nI would now like to turn to the progress report of\r\nthe Secretary-General (A/57/172) on the\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained in\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the causes of\r\nconflict and the promotion of durable peace and\r\nsustainable development in Africa. The European\r\nUnion is committed to working with African partners\r\nin strengthening regional and local capacities for\r\nconflict prevention, management and resolution.\r\nCurrently, the EU is looking at ways to further\r\nreinforce and broaden support for the development of\r\nAfrican capacity in the area of conflict prevention and\r\nresolution. And the EU is committed to help strengthen\r\nand consolidate United Nations peace support\r\noperations and assist in post-conflict reconstruction\r\nefforts. That cooperation is rooted in the fundamental\r\nprinciple of ownership, meaning that the primary\r\nresponsibility lies with Africa itself. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the peace and security initiative of NEPAD,\r\nincluding the Peace and Security Council of the\r\nAfrican Union, which is based on this principle and\r\nwhich will reshape the framework for strengthening the\r\nAfrican security architecture. In this respect, we also\r\nacknowledge the vital role to be played by the African\r\nsubregional organizations in contributing to the\r\nresolution of conflicts. They are important building\r\nblocks for African political and economic integration,\r\nand they have the potential to contribute to securing\r\npeace and prosperity in Africa.\r\nThe report rightly points to the ways in which the\r\nproliferation of arms, small arms and light weapons in\r\nparticular, is fuelling conflict. The European Union is\r\nactively engaged in trying to prevent the excessive\r\naccumulation of arms in Africa. But for any effort to be\r\nsustainable, there clearly is a need to develop — with\r\nthe African Union and, in particular, with the\r\nsubregional organizations — far more effective\r\nmechanisms for arms control.\r\nThe fight for control over natural resources is yet\r\nanother very apparent source of conflict in Africa. In\r\nthat regard, the European Union encourages the\r\ncontinuation of the Kimberley Process, which plays an\r\nimportant role in the prevention of conflicts in Africa.\r\nFinally, we commend the United Nations for\r\nhaving decided to scale up its response to situations of\r\nconflict and its peace-building in Africa. We consider\r\nthe United Nations to be a very important global actor\r\nin that respect. The establishment of the Security\r\nCouncil’s Ad Hoc Working Group on Conflict\r\nPrevention and Resolution in Africa and the recent\r\nestablishment of an Economic and Social Council Ad\r\nHoc Advisory Group on African countries emerging\r\nfrom conflict may provide opportunities to enhance\r\ncoordination between those two Councils. We need to\r\nrecognize and act upon integrated and complementary\r\napproaches to conflict resolution, peace-building and\r\ndevelopment in Africa, as called for by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nMr. Lancry (Israel): The past year has been\r\nseminal in many ways for the African continent and for\r\nits relations with the international community. Not only\r\nhave a number of major conflicts come that much\r\ncloser to resolution, but the continent itself has taken\r\ndramatic steps to assert control over its own destiny for\r\nthe benefit of its 700 million inhabitants.\r\nIn the realm of conflict resolution, this year has\r\nseen great strides made in restoring peace and security\r\nin Angola, Sierra Leone and on the border between\r\nEthiopia and Eritrea. Further, a number of other\r\npositive developments, specifically in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, the Mano river basin and in the\r\nSudan, will undoubtedly contribute even more to the\r\natmosphere of peace and stability when they reach\r\nfruition.\r\nEven more important in Israel’s eyes are the\r\npolitical developments at the regional level, which will\r\nserve to cement the progress made in the fields of\r\nconflict resolution and conflict prevention. Indeed, it\r\nhas often been said that development - and especially\r\nsustainable development - is the best insurance against\r\nconflict, and that peace and security are the best\r\nbackdrop against which to pursue active development\r\npolicies. The most obvious of those are, without a\r\ndoubt, the birth of the African Union on the one hand,\r\nand the launch of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) on the other hand.\r\nIsrael cannot agree more with the approach,\r\noutlined in the progress report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, of moving from a culture of reaction to\r\nconflict to one of prevention. That change embodies\r\nthe highest ideals of this Organization, as enshrined in\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nthe Charter. Prevention drastically reduces the\r\neconomic and social costs of conflict and, most\r\nimportant of all, the human costs. That is the ideal\r\nupon which this Organization was founded — to save\r\nmankind from the scourge of war — and Israel shares\r\nthe belief that there is no better way to protect our\r\nchildren from the wars of tomorrow than by preventing\r\nconflicts today.\r\nSimilarly, the efforts made in building durable\r\npeace and promoting sustainable development are\r\nnoteworthy. We find it meaningful that the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development took place on the\r\nAfrican continent, thus not only underscoring Africa’s\r\ncommitment to the principles of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, but also highlighting the world’s\r\nrecognition of Africa as an appropriate venue for\r\ndiscussions on that crucial matter.\r\nIsrael has always considered its relations with\r\nAfrica to be of highest priority. Since the late 1950s,\r\nIsrael has sought to build development partnerships\r\nwith the newly independent States of sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica. While still a developing nation itself, Israel was\r\ndetermined to share some of the hard-learned lessons\r\nof nation-building with others. Grateful for the\r\nguidance we had received in our earliest days, we felt\r\nthat the knowledge and the experience gained were not\r\nsolely ours, but, rather, were a trust held by Israel to be\r\npassed along, as needed.\r\nThus was born Israel’s Centre for International\r\nCooperation (MASHAV), one of the first examples of\r\ncooperation between developing nations themselves.\r\nNow, almost 50 years later, that cooperation has\r\nbecome a tradition and a commitment rather than a\r\nmere experiment.\r\nAs a result of those beginnings, MASHAV’s\r\nactivities were always based on the premise that we\r\ncannot presume to instruct others on subjects of\r\ndevelopment; we can only build capacity, especially\r\nhuman capacity, to enable developing countries to\r\napply their understanding to their challenges in a local\r\ncontext. There can be no one right answer for all given\r\nsituations in every country, be it the empowerment of\r\nwomen, coping with natural disaster or the\r\nimprovement of food security. The best that can be\r\ndone is to try to share an approach to problem solving\r\nthat can then be applied in one or a number of specific\r\ncontexts. That is the MASHAV philosophy, one that\r\nhas been working for close to half a century.\r\nIt is for precisely those reasons that Israel greets\r\nthe initiative embodied by NEPAD. The NEPAD\r\napproach of cooperation at the regional level to\r\nmaximize the optimal and efficient distribution of\r\nlimited resources is laudable and, in our opinion, is a\r\ngreat step forward. Furthermore, the expansion of the\r\ndevelopment process to include stakeholders formerly\r\noverlooked or marginalized is paramount.\r\nIsrael stands ready to take up the challenge\r\npresented by Africa in the form of NEPAD; indeed, if\r\nthat will lead to more effective exploitation of our\r\ncooperative efforts, so much the better. We therefore\r\nlook forward to the fruitful continuation of our\r\nlongstanding partnership.\r\nIsrael would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor the effort invested in the reports, while at the same\r\ntime congratulating the leaders of Africa on the\r\nimportant steps of self-empowerment taken in the past\r\nyear. In the Middle East, we consider optimism to be a\r\nsurvival skill; however, I cannot but believe that for all\r\nthe challenges posed — be they man-made or\r\nnatural — there is indeed hope if we continue on the\r\npath of mutual respect, mutual support and mutual\r\nachievement. In this interdependent global village,\r\nthere can be no artificial distinctions, and so we say:\r\nAfrica’s future is our future; its successes, as well as its\r\nfailures, are the successes and failures of the entire\r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): My delegation would first\r\nof all like to thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on the causes of conflict and the\r\npromotion of durable peace and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Despite their great potential\r\nand human resources, African countries continue to\r\nface many of the world’s greatest challenges.\r\nDevelopment efforts have lagged behind in Africa\r\nmore than they have in any other region in the world.\r\nConflict, disease, debt, poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment remain the characteristics of today’s\r\nAfrica. However, in this age of globalization and\r\ninterdependence, Africa should have its fair share of\r\nthe benefits of globalization. My delegation is of the\r\nview that the global community should pay serious\r\nattention to Africa and should nurture stronger\r\npartnership with the region.\r\nInternational focus on Africa is not a new\r\nphenomenon. One of the significant initiatives\r\nintroduced by the United Nations was the United\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s (UN-NADAF), adopted by the General\r\nAssembly in its resolution 46/151 of 18 December\r\n1991. It was a package of mutual commitments by\r\nAfrican countries and the international community to\r\naccelerate the transformation, integration and\r\ndiversification of African economies, to reduce their\r\nvulnerability to external shocks and to enhance their\r\nself-reliance. My delegation would like to express its\r\ndeep appreciation for the work of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee of the Whole of the General Assembly for\r\nthe Final Review and Appraisal of the Implementation\r\nof UN-NADAF and for the report submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General on that matter, as well as for the\r\nrecommendations and proposals for future engagement\r\nwith the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). Nonetheless, the result of the final review,\r\naccording to the Ad Hoc Committee, is far from\r\nsatisfactory and is less encouraging.\r\nPeace and stability are prerequisites for\r\nsustainable development in every region of the world.\r\nHowever, Africa’s recent history has not been totally\r\nfree of civil strife and conflicts. Nevertheless, we are\r\nheartened to learn that progress has been made towards\r\nrestoring peace and stability in some regions of Africa.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to commend\r\nthe tireless efforts of the Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations which have contributed to that\r\nprogress.\r\nWe are encouraged by the initiative of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), put\r\nforward by African leaders at their summit meeting in\r\nJuly 2001. It is a home-grown initiative that will\r\nguarantee the future development of Africa. Peace,\r\nsecurity, democracy and good governance, improved\r\neconomic and corporate governance and regional\r\ncooperation and integration, affirmed by NEPAD, will\r\nsurely pave the way for future development in Africa.\r\nThe reorganization of the Organization of African\r\nUnity as the African Union also provides a new\r\ndynamism for cooperation among African nations,\r\nemphasizing economic integration as a means to\r\nachieve greater political unity among African\r\ncountries. In this respect, my delegation also welcomes\r\nthe United Nations Declaration on the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (resolution 57/2), adopted at\r\nthe high-level plenary meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on 16 September 2002.\r\nAfrica has many daunting challenges to overcome\r\nin order to achieve sustainable development. This has\r\nto be done through a comprehensive and multifaceted\r\napproach. The major challenges for Africa are the\r\nreduction of poverty and hunger and the treatment of\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\r\nReducing by half the number of Africans living in\r\npoverty by the year 2015, as stipulated by the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, requires an average\r\nannual rate of economic growth of at least 7 per cent in\r\nAfrica. However, the performance of African countries\r\nduring the last decade was far below that target, with\r\nan average of only approximately 3 per cent. Africa\r\nmust spur its economic growth to alleviate poverty and\r\nto overcome hunger, which requires considerable\r\nresources. However, domestic saving is very low in\r\nAfrica, and most of the resource requirements rely on\r\nexternal sources such as borrowing, official\r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and foreign direct\r\ninvestment. The recent G-8 meeting in Kananaskis\r\ncreated the hope that the developed countries would\r\nprovide more ODA to Africa to implement the NEPAD\r\ninitiative. While it should be welcomed that the\r\nindustrialized countries have pledged to increase their\r\nODA to $12 billion by the year 2006, half of which\r\nwill be channelled to Africa, the industrialized\r\ncountries should also strive to increase their ODA to\r\nthe agreed target of 0.7 per cent of Gross Domestic\r\nProduct. Africa, for its part, should make every effort\r\nto attract more foreign direct investment by creating a\r\nclimate conducive to such investments.\r\nThe issue of debt relief for Africa deserves\r\nserious consideration in order to enable the continent to\r\nfree up resources for economic development and social\r\nspending. We welcome the Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries (HIPC) initiative of the World Bank for the\r\nreduction of African debt. We are also encouraged by\r\nthe fact that there will be $19 billion in debt reduction\r\nfor 22 African countries demonstrating sound\r\neconomic policies and good governance. We call for\r\nfaster and deeper debt relief to Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries, with fewer imposed conditions. My\r\ndelegation agrees with the assertion that debt relief\r\nalone, no matter how generous, cannot guarantee long-\r\nterm debt sustainability. A durable solution must be\r\nbased on sound policies, good governance, prudent\r\nnew borrowing and sound debt management by HIPC,\r\nas well as responsible financing by creditors.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nOne of the greatest challenges confronting Africa\r\ntoday is the threat of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Seventy\r\nper cent of the cases of HIV infection occur in Africa,\r\nand the disease has taken a toll of 2.2 million lives\r\nthere in 2001 alone. This has not only seriously\r\naffected labour productivity and life expectancy but\r\nalso had enormous economic and social consequences.\r\nMy delegation is heartened to know that all key\r\norganizations of the United Nations system are now\r\nmainstreaming the issue of HIV/AIDS into their\r\nprojects and programmes in Africa and that the World\r\nBank has recently allocated $1 billion for multi-\r\ncountry HIV/AIDS programmes for Africa, especially\r\nfor sub-Saharan Africa. The Secretary-General’s\r\ncreation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS is also a\r\nlaudable initiative. Raising the Fund to the target level\r\nof $7 billion to $10 billion per year would greatly help\r\ncombat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, especially in the sub-\r\nSaharan region.\r\nThe future direction of development in Africa has\r\nbeen clearly outlined in NEPAD, which is an initiative\r\nled, owned and managed by Africans. Although the\r\nprimary responsibility for the implementation of\r\nNEPAD lies with the African countries concerned, its\r\nsuccess depends on the fostering of a concerted and\r\ncoherent response to the initiative by the global\r\ncommunity, including international and regional\r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector. In\r\nconclusion, my delegation would like to express its full\r\nsupport for Africa’s effort to establish greater peace\r\nand stability and to bring about sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment through their own initiative.\r\nMs. Pulido Santana (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The joint consideration of these two items\r\nenables us to evaluate from a global perspective the\r\nresults of the international community’s assistance to\r\nAfrica so that the continent can achieve sustainable\r\nsocio-economic growth and development and alleviate\r\nthe impact that internal and international conflicts have\r\nhad on countries in trying to achieve those goals.\r\nThe priority goals of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF) were to promote the comprehensive\r\ntransformation, diversification and accelerated growth\r\nof African economies in order to strengthen them and\r\nto integrate them into the world economy, as well as to\r\npromote human development and to increase\r\nproductive employment. The programme reflected the\r\ncommitments and responsibilities of both Africa and\r\nthe international community, based on the recognition\r\nthat the development of Africa is the fundamental\r\nresponsibility of Africans themselves.\r\nIn order to achieve those objectives, the\r\ninternational community committed itself to providing\r\ntotal and tangible support during the implementation\r\ndecade and noted that the continent’s gross domestic\r\nproduct required an annual growth rate of at least 6 per\r\ncent to attain sustainable economic growth.\r\nNevertheless, as is pointed out in the report on\r\nthe independent evaluation of the programme, during a\r\nlarge part of the decade the growth rate was only 3 per\r\ncent — in other words, far lower than the rate needed\r\nto achieve its objective of poverty alleviation.\r\nThis insufficient growth can be explained by the\r\nfailure to materialize of the promised international\r\nassistance; increased dependency on basic\r\ncommodities; the low level of trade between African\r\ncountries; declining participation of exports in global\r\ntrade; inability to take advantage of market-access\r\nconcessions in any significant way; and a growing\r\ndependency on assistance and on debt financing as a\r\nresult of the steady drop in export income.\r\nDespite these hard facts, Africa reaffirmed its\r\nconfidence in the international community. Last\r\nSeptember the General Assembly held a plenary high-\r\nlevel session to consider how the United Nations\r\nsystem could assist the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). In order for NEPAD to reach\r\nits objectives and to achieve better results than did\r\nprior initiatives, it needs the support and backup of the\r\ninternational community as a whole — not just through\r\nwords or mere expressions of solidarity, but rather by\r\nentering into a partnership with Africa in order that it\r\nmight realize its development objectives.\r\nAfrican leaders designed NEPAD on the basis of\r\na common vision and of the very sound and shared\r\nconviction that it is their urgent duty to eradicate\r\npoverty and lead their countries, both individually and\r\ncollectively, towards sustainable growth and\r\ndevelopment and to participate actively in the global\r\neconomy and in the global political decision-making\r\nprocess. This vision of a strong and united Africa\r\nacknowledges the need to build a partnership between\r\nGovernments and all segments of civil society,\r\nincluding women, young people and the private sector,\r\nwith a view to promoting solidarity and cohesion.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\nThis reflects the determination of Africans to free\r\nthemselves and the continent from socio-economic\r\nunderdevelopment and exclusion in the context of\r\nglobalization. This is to be achieved through\r\ndemocracy, good governance and respect for human\r\nrights, with peace, security and stability seen as\r\nprerequisites for achieving its development and\r\nintegration in the global economy.\r\nThe President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez Frías,\r\nspeaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China at the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment at Monterrey last March, proposed the\r\ncreation of an international humanitarian fund.\r\nRecently, during the celebration of World Food Day,\r\norganized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations, he reiterated the need for such a\r\nfund, which would be financed by 10 per cent of the\r\nexternal debt of the developing world; 10 percent of\r\nmilitary expenditures; a percentage of the resources\r\nconfiscated from drug traffickers and international\r\norganized crime; and by resources stemming from a tax\r\non international speculative capital movements. The\r\nresources provided by such a fund could save many\r\nhuman lives and help many people in Africa emerge\r\nfrom poverty.\r\nFrom this rostrum, and on behalf of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we reiterate the\r\nneed to create such an international humanitarian fund.\r\nSuch an instrument would contribute to putting an end\r\nto the causes of conflict as well as to promoting\r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nand in the other regions of the world that are in such\r\nneed of it.\r\nMr. Hassan (Pakistan): It is a great pleasure for\r\nme to participate in this important discussion under the\r\nstewardship of President Jan Kavan.\r\nLet me thank the Secretary-General for his report\r\non the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable\r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa, as well as\r\nhis report on the final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and that on the\r\nimplementation of the Programme for the Second\r\nIndustrial Development Decade for Africa.\r\nAfrica is a vast and varied continent. The sources\r\nof conflict in Africa reflect this diversity and\r\ncomplexity. The causes range from historical legacies\r\nand internal power struggles to economic motives.\r\nSimilarly, Africa remains among the poorest regions in\r\nthe world. Its poverty is further exacerbated by the\r\nunsustainable levels of its external debt burden, the\r\ndeteriorating terms of trade, declining official\r\ndevelopment assistance, falling commodity prices,\r\nincreasing protectionism in developed countries, and\r\nthe negative effects of structural adjustment\r\nprogrammes.\r\nMany initiatives have been taken by the United\r\nNations to address the issues of peace and security as\r\nwell as the various dimensions of economic and social\r\ndevelopment in Africa. Some success has been\r\nachieved, but the overall situation of the African\r\ncontinent has not improved over the last two decades.\r\nPoverty, disease, famine, lack of human- resource\r\ndevelopment, the external debt burden, and conflict and\r\nstrife remain the major obstacles to the development of\r\nAfrica.\r\nAfrica faces enormous challenges. Africa\r\nalone — in fact, no region or nation alone— can face\r\nsuch challenges. The international community must\r\ntherefore lend its full support to regional and national\r\nefforts to achieve the twin goals of peace and\r\ndevelopment in the African region. Africa needs to be\r\nsupported in the process of addressing the root causes\r\nof conflicts. This requires a concerted international\r\neffort at two levels. In the first instance, there is a need\r\nto focus on the underlying political and security aspects\r\nof the instability prevailing in that continent. In\r\nparallel, the economic and social problems afflicting\r\nparts of Africa need to be tackled through a\r\ncomprehensive assistance programme with adequate\r\nresources.\r\nConflict prevention is important, but is not a\r\nsufficient condition for the establishment of durable\r\npeace. Mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter,\r\nshould be activated to address the root causes of\r\nconflicts, including the resolution of festering disputes.\r\nDevelopment assistance to Africa is a prerequisite\r\nfor the success of any development effort there. But\r\nassistance loses its value if it is motivated by\r\nconditionalities or political returns. Neither peace nor\r\ndevelopment should be held to ransom. Without\r\nenhanced official development assistance, increased\r\ninvestment, a durable solution to the external debt\r\nburden, market access for products and services from\r\nthe African region and integration of the African\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.34\r\ncountries into the global economy, efforts to achieve\r\nthe goals of durable peace and sustainable development\r\nare not likely to make any headway. In order to achieve\r\ninternational development goals in Africa, the\r\neconomic and social development indicators of African\r\ncountries have to be improved.\r\nCognizant of their own responsibilities, the\r\nAfrican countries have developed an integrated and\r\ncomprehensive framework for Africa’ s development.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) offers hope. It sets out a broad vision of\r\nAfrica’ s future, outlines a strategy for achieving that\r\nvision and spells out a Programme of Action focused\r\non a number of key priority areas.\r\nMany elements of NEPAD, such as those relating\r\nto peace and security, poverty alleviation, socio-\r\neconomic development, governance and infrastructure\r\ndevelopment, directly correspond to the elements of\r\nongoing United Nations programmes in African\r\ncountries. We are glad that the Members of the United\r\nNations have pledged their full support to NEPAD. We\r\nhope that the United Nations will also play a tangible\r\nrole in support of NEPAD.\r\nMy delegation would like to emphasize that the\r\ninternational community’s commitment to NEPAD and\r\nthe promotion of peace and prosperity in Africa will be\r\njudged by its success in translating rhetoric into reality.\r\nWe should not be found wanting in generating the\r\nnecessary political will to turn words into deeds.\r\nIn the high-level debate held on 16 September,\r\nPakistan’s Minister for Foreign Affairs pledged our full\r\nsupport to NEPAD. My delegation would like to\r\nreiterate our support, not only to NEPAD, but also to\r\nother similar initiatives aimed at restoring peace and\r\ndevelopment in Africa. We believe, however, that the\r\ninternational community needs to complement those\r\nAfrican initiatives, first of all by ensuring enhanced\r\nand guaranteed access by African countries to the\r\nmarkets of developed countries.\r\nSecondly, there should be accelerated and\r\nincreased debt relief to the poor African countries,\r\nincluding outright debt cancellation. The conversion of\r\nall remaining official debt of the poorest African\r\ncountries into grants needs to be given serious\r\nconsideration. Thirdly, Africa’s agricultural\r\nperformance and food security should be improved.\r\nAfrica should be provided with the requisite\r\ntechnologies and resources to ensure its development.\r\nFourthly, investment should be increased in Africa’s\r\nhuman resources. Finally, financial resources should be\r\neffectively mobilized. Africa will require an additional\r\n$20 billion to $30 billion a year to effectively reduce\r\nthe problem of poverty. The goals of NEPAD cannot be\r\nachieved unless we ensure sufficient resource flows to\r\nAfrica.\r\nFor its part, Pakistan has consistently supported\r\nthe political and economic aspirations of Africa. We\r\nare proud of our participation in several United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa. Our military and\r\ncivilian personnel have been part of United Nations\r\noperations in Somalia, Namibia, Liberia, Western\r\nSahara and, recently, Sierra Leone. Pakistan will\r\ncontinue to lend moral and material support to African\r\ncountries. Our technical assistance programme for\r\nAfrica is an ongoing process of training young\r\nprofessionals in diverse fields.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on items 33 and 41.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda items 33 and 41.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.35 p.m.\r\n"
