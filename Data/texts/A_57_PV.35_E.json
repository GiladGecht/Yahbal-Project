(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 15 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(c) Election of five members of the International\r\nCourt of Justice\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General\r\n(A/57/305)\r\nList of candidates (A/57/306)\r\nCurricula vitae (A/57/307)\r\nThe President: This morning, the General\r\nAssembly will proceed to the election of five members\r\nof the International Court of Justice for a nine-year\r\nterm commencing on 6 February 2003. The terms of\r\noffice of the following judges expire on 5 February\r\n2003: Mr. Shi Jiuyong (China), Mr. Shigeru Oda\r\n(Japan), Mr. Géza Herczegh (Hungary), Mr. Carl-\r\nAugust Fleischhauer (Germany) and Mr. Abdul G.\r\nKoroma (Sierra Leone).\r\nIn connection with the election, I should like to\r\nbring the following matters to the attention of the\r\nmembers of the General Assembly.\r\nI should like to confirm that, at this time, the\r\nSecurity Council, independently of the General\r\nAssembly, is also proceeding to elect five members of\r\nthe Court. This procedure is in accordance with Article\r\n8 of the Statute of the Court, which provides that\r\nThe General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil shall proceed independently of one\r\nanother to elect the members of the Court.\r\nAccordingly, the results of the voting in the General\r\nAssembly will not be communicated to the Security\r\nCouncil until five candidates have obtained the\r\nrequired majority in the Assembly.\r\nI should like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the documents relating to the election.\r\nThe list of candidates who have been nominated by\r\nnational groups is to be found in document A/57/306.\r\nThe curricula vitae of the candidates are to be found in\r\ndocument A/57/307. The Assembly also has before it\r\ndocument A/57/305, containing a memorandum by the\r\nSecretary-General on the present composition of the\r\nCourt and on the procedure to be followed in the\r\nAssembly and in the Security Council with regard to\r\nthe election.\r\nIn accordance with article 10, paragraph 1, of the\r\nStatute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an\r\nabsolute majority of votes both in the General\r\nAssembly and in the Security Council shall be\r\nconsidered as elected.\r\nThe consistent practice of the United Nations has\r\nbeen to interpret the words absolute majority as\r\nmeaning a majority of all electors whether or not they\r\nvote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General\r\nAssembly are all 191 Member States. Accordingly, for\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.35\r\nthe present election, 96 votes constitute an absolute\r\nmajority in the General Assembly.\r\nIf in the first ballot fewer than five candidates\r\nobtain an absolute majority, it will be necessary to\r\nproceed to further ballots until five candidates have\r\nobtained that majority. Pursuant to the decision taken\r\nby the General Assembly at its 915th meeting, held on\r\n16 November 1960, those ballots shall be unrestricted.\r\nI should like to remind representatives that,\r\npursuant to rule 88 of the Assemblys rules of\r\nprocedure,\r\nAfter the President has announced the\r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall\r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in\r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.\r\nTherefore, any announcements, such as those\r\nconcerning withdrawals of candidatures, should be\r\nmade prior to the commencement of the voting process,\r\nthat is to say before the announcement of the beginning\r\nof the voting process.\r\nI should like to bring another matter to the\r\nattention of the General Assembly. Cases have arisen in\r\nthe Security Council in which more than the required\r\nnumber of candidates have obtained an absolute\r\nmajority on the same ballet. The same also occurred in\r\nthe General Assembly at the 45th plenary meeting of\r\nthe fifty-fourth session, on 3 November 1999. The\r\npractice followed by the Security Council has been to\r\nhold a new vote on all the candidates, and the President\r\nof the Council made no notification to the President of\r\nthe General Assembly until only the required number\r\nof candidates, and no more, had obtained the absolute\r\nmajority in the Security Council.\r\nSimilarly, at the fifty-fourth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly more than the required number of\r\ncandidates obtained an absolute majority on the same\r\nballot. The General Assembly decided to hold a new\r\nballot on all the candidates, and the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly made no notification to the\r\nPresident of the Security Council until only the\r\nrequired number of candidates, and no more, had\r\nobtained an absolute majority.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to the\r\nprocedures I have just outlined?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Muchetwa (Zimbabwe): I would like to\r\ninform the General Assembly that Mr. Walter J. Kamba\r\nand Mr. Arthur J. Manase have withdrawn from the\r\nrace.\r\nThe President: Members have heard the\r\nstatement by the representative of Zimbabwe that\r\nMr. Walter J. Kamba and Mr. Arthur J. Manase no\r\nlonger wish to be considered as candidates.\r\nAccordingly, the names of Mr. Walter J. Kamba and\r\nMr. Arthur J. Manase have been deleted from the ballot\r\npapers that will be distributed.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of\r\nrepresentatives during the conduct of the election.\r\nPlease be reminded that during the voting process all\r\ncampaigning should cease in the General Assembly\r\nHall. This means in particular that once the election has\r\nbegun no more campaign material can be distributed\r\ninside the Hall. All representatives are also requested\r\nto remain at their seats so that the voting process can\r\nproceed in an orderly manner. I thank representatives\r\nin advance for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot\r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to use only the\r\nballot papers now being distributed. Only those\r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are\r\neligible. Representatives will indicate the five\r\ncandidates for whom they wish to vote by placing\r\ncrosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers.\r\nBallot papers on which more than five names are\r\nmarked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast\r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot\r\npapers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Baaziz\r\n(Algeria), Ms. Davtyan (Armenia), Mr. Psiachas\r\n(Greece), Mr. Francis (Jamaica), Mr. Al-Ojaili\r\n(Oman) and Ms. Matti (Switzerland) acted as\r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and\r\nresumed at 11.35 a.m.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.35\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as\r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 183\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 183\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 183\r\nRequired absolute majority: 96\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Hisashi Owada (Japan) 169\r\nMr. Shi Jiuyong (China) 167\r\nMr. Peter Tomka (Slovakia) 149\r\nMr. Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra Leone) 134\r\nMr. Bruno Simma (Germany) 123\r\nMr. Hans Corell (Sweden) 94\r\nMr. John Dugard (South Africa) 43\r\nMr. Vojin Dimitrijević (Yugoslavia) 25\r\nThe following five candidates have obtained an\r\nabsolute majority in the General Assembly: Mr. Abdul\r\nG. Koroma, Mr. Hisashi Owada, Mr. Shi Jiuyong,\r\nMr. Bruno Simma and Mr. Peter Tomka.\r\nI have communicated the result of the voting to\r\nthe President of the Security Council.\r\nI have received a letter from the President of the\r\nSecurity Council. I call on the representative of the\r\nSecretariat to read out that letter.\r\nMr. Perfiliev (Director, General Assembly and\r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs Division) (spoke\r\nin French):\r\nI have the honour to inform you that at the\r\n4629th meeting of the Security Council, held on\r\n21 October 2002, for the purpose of electing five\r\nmembers of the International Court of Justice for\r\na term of office beginning on 6 February 2003,\r\nMr. Abdul Koroma, Mr. Hisashi Owada, Mr. Shi\r\nJiuyong, Mr. Bruno Simma and Mr. Peter Tomka\r\nobtained an absolute majority of votes.\r\nThe President: As a result of the independent\r\nvoting in the Security Council and in the General\r\nAssembly, the following five candidates have obtained\r\nan absolute majority in both organs: Mr. Abdul G.\r\nKoroma, Mr. Hisashi Owada, Mr. Shi Jiuyong,\r\nMr. Bruno Simma and Mr. Peter Tomka. They are\r\ntherefore duly elected members of the International\r\nCourt of Justice to serve for a nine-year term\r\ncommencing on 6 February 2003. I take this\r\nopportunity to extend to them the Assemblys\r\ncongratulations on their election and to thank the\r\ntellers for their assistance.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of sub-item (c) of agenda item 15.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members\r\nthat document A/INF/57/3/Rev.1, containing a revised\r\nprogramme of work and schedule of plenary meetings\r\nfor the main part of the fifty-seventh session, was\r\nissued this morning. I should also like to remind\r\nmembers that the lists of speakers for items listed in\r\ndocument A/INF/57/3/Rev.1 are open.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.\r\n"
