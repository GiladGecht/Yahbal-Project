(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 45\r\nReport of the International Tribunal for the\r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious\r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law\r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia\r\nsince 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting\r\nthe ninth annual report of the International\r\nTribunal (A/57/379)\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\ntakes note of the ninth annual report of the\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Claude Jorda,\r\nPresident of the International Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia.\r\nMr. Jorda (spoke in French): It is a great honour\r\nfor me to address this Assembly once again as I present\r\nthe ninth annual report of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia, over which I have\r\nthe honour to preside.\r\nAllow me first, on behalf of all my colleagues\r\nand of the Tribunal as a whole, to express my profound\r\ngratitude for the support the Assembly has always\r\nafforded our institution. When I had the honour of\r\npresenting the eighth annual report of the International\r\nTribunal to the Assembly last year, I shared in\r\nparticular my concerns regarding the need to adapt the\r\nachievement of the International Tribunals mission to\r\nthe political changes in the former Yugoslavia. In fact,\r\nI shared some thoughts on the future priorities of the\r\njudicial institution over which I preside, describing in\r\nparticular the need to direct the Tribunals activity\r\nmore towards the prosecution of crimes which\r\nconstitute the most serious breaches of international\r\npublic order, and setting out new ways in which to\r\npromote the trial of certain cases by courts in the States\r\nof the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThis process of reflection, initiated in 2000-2001,\r\nhas since brought about a vast movement of reform, the\r\nfoundations and main characteristics of which I will\r\nattempt to present at a later stage. For the moment, I\r\nwill just say that 2001-2002 will have been marked not\r\nonly by the effective implementation of the structural\r\nchanges adopted in 2000 but also, and more\r\nparticularly, by the setting out of a plan of action\r\nidentifying the future directions of the International\r\nTribunal.\r\nThe drafting of the plan of action is one outcome\r\nof an overall process of reflection, undertaken by the\r\nTribunal in early 2000, on its judicial status and the\r\nmeans by which to accomplish its mission in the\r\nshortest possible time. I take the liberty of recalling\r\nthat, in January 2000, the Tribunal began a large-scale\r\nreform of its structure and operation resulting, inter\r\nalia, in the adoption on 30 November 2000 of\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nresolution 1329 (2000), by which the Security Council\r\napproved the creation of a pool of ad litem judges and\r\nthe appointment of two additional judges to the\r\nAppeals Chamber. The aim of these reforms was to\r\nimplement practical and flexible solutions that would\r\nallow the judges to deal with a considerable increase in\r\ntheir workload and thus respond more effectively to the\r\nneeds of the accused and the expectations of the\r\nvictims.\r\nToday, I will attempt to present a summary of the\r\nTribunals activity and the main aspects of this plan of\r\naction. To begin, I would recall that the Tribunal is\r\nseeing a considerable increase in its activity at this\r\ntime. I would also emphasize that, despite the increase\r\nin its activity, the Tribunal cannot try on its own all\r\nthose accused of war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity. At any rate, it must be said that, were it to do\r\nso, it could not honour its commitments to the Security\r\nCouncil. We therefore had to implement an appropriate\r\nand realistic strategy at The Hague that would allow\r\nthose presumed responsible for crimes constituting the\r\nmost serious breaches of international public order in\r\nthe former Yugoslavia to be prosecuted as a priority.\r\nFinally, I will describe the effective implementation of\r\nthe programme, which is far from being accomplished.\r\nFirst, let me address the commitments and\r\nconcrete measures undertaken. The Tribunal is today\r\nfunctioning at full capacity. It is honouring the\r\ncommitments it made to the Security Council and is\r\ncurrently holding six simultaneous trials daily, as\r\nopposed to three in previous years. There is a total of\r\n25 judges at the Tribunal. In 2001-2002, nine ad litem\r\njudges were appointed by the Secretary-General and\r\nserved alongside the permanent judges. Consequently,\r\nas was to be expected, the number of trials has\r\nincreased significantly. This increased activity has led\r\nto a significant rise in the number of decisions\r\nrendered. In fact, in the past year, the Trial Chambers\r\nexamined over 20 cases and rendered five judgements\r\non the merits.\r\nIn November 2001, pursuant to the resolution to\r\nwhich I referred earlier, two additional judges from the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda joined the\r\nAppeals Chamber of the Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia. I recall that the Appeals Chamber serves\r\nboth Tribunals. It pronounced 20 or so interlocutory\r\ndecisions, two appeals on the merits and ruled on two\r\nreview applications. I would add that the structure and\r\nworking methods of the Appeals Chamber were subject\r\nto reforms. Moreover, we established an international\r\nbar for defence counsel and to amend the Code of\r\nProfessional Ethics. I anticipate greater efficiency of\r\nthe Tribunals functioning to result from improved\r\ntraining for defence counsel, a stricter Code and,\r\nultimately, better participation of defence counsel in\r\nthe Tribunals effectiveness and efficiency.\r\nAt the same time, now is not the moment for self-\r\nsatisfaction. This report should not conceal the\r\ndifficulties encountered, particularly concerning the\r\nlength of trials. The rate at which the Tribunal tries its\r\naccused is still too slow. Need I remind the Assembly\r\nthat, as matters stand, some of the accused will not be\r\ntried within the next two years, a period which will\r\nonly increase if no effective measure is taken to\r\nexpedite proceedings?\r\nThe Tribunal must therefore continue striving to\r\nensure further improvements in our current judiciary\r\nprocesses. We judges must deepen, improve and\r\ndiscuss them. In that respect, a new working group will\r\nsubmit its conclusions to me in the next few weeks.\r\nThis being so, the reforms undertaken will not on\r\ntheir own suffice for the Tribunal to honour its\r\ncommitments to the Security Council, including an end\r\nto investigations in 2004, the end of trial proceedings\r\nby 2008-2010 and the end of appeals proceedings in a\r\nfinal four-year mandate.\r\nI wish now to discuss the Tribunals future\r\ndirections, which I set out to the Security Council and\r\nabout which the General Assembly should be informed.\r\nA series of steps have been initiated by the\r\nProsecutor, who is present in the Hall and whom I\r\ncommend, and by the Registrar. The three organs of the\r\nTribunal work hand in hand in exercising this entirely\r\nnew form of international justice. In January 2002, we\r\ngave these issues some thought and decided to move\r\ntowards a possible referral process of certain cases to\r\nthe national courts of the States of the former\r\nYugoslavia. The Prosecutor, the Registrar and I drafted\r\na report on the judicial status of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the\r\nprospects for referring certain cases to national courts.\r\nThis reflection also benefited from a certain number of\r\nmeetings, in particular with a group of experts\r\nmandated by the High Representative for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, and from visits and meetings with all\r\ninvolved parties in Sarajevo and in the two entities of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation and the\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nRepublika Srpska. I discussed all this at the plenary\r\nmeeting of a Security Council in July 2002, and the\r\nCouncil has been giving this information its\r\nconsideration.\r\nThis strategy comprises two main aspects:\r\nrealigning Tribunal activity on the trial of the highest-\r\nranking military, paramilitary and civilian leaders\r\nresponsible for war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity; and refering certain cases of lesser\r\nimportance to the national courts. In July 2002, having\r\nreviewed the ongoing investigations, the Prosecutor of\r\nthe Tribunal considered that a certain number of\r\nintermediary or lower-level accused could, in fact, be\r\ntried by the courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nOn 23 July, Ms. Del Ponte and I had the honour\r\nof presenting the aforesaid directions to the Security\r\nCouncil. I wished to ascertain, on behalf of the judges\r\nof the Tribunal, that we were, in fact, duly mandated by\r\nthe Statute before undertaking all the measures\r\nnecessary to implement the referral process. Following\r\nthis discussion, the President of the Security Council\r\nissued a statement on behalf of the Council endorsing\r\nthe reports broad strategy for the transfer of\r\ncases involving intermediary and lower-level\r\naccused to competent national jurisdictions as\r\nthe best way of allowing the ICTY to achieve its\r\ncurrent objective of completing all trial activities\r\nat first instance by 2008. (S/PRST/2002/21)\r\nThe Security Council also\r\ninvites States and relevant international and\r\nregional organizations to contribute as\r\nappropriate to the strengthening of national\r\njudicial systems of the States of the former\r\nYugoslavia in order to facilitate the\r\nimplementation of this policy. (ibid)\r\nThe essential question remains as to how the reform\r\nmay be effectively implemented.\r\nIt bears emphasizing that this goal does not\r\ndepend solely upon the work of the International\r\nTribunal. Since the strategy seeks, among other things,\r\nto refer a number of cases to the domestic courts, it\r\ninvolves a large number of players, and not only the\r\nJudges and the Prosecutor. I will try to explain. These\r\nplayers are, first of all, of course, the International\r\nTribunal, followed by those officials responsible at the\r\nnational level, and finally, the international community\r\nitself, which you are and which you represent.\r\nFirst of all, the International Tribunal: What must\r\nit do in order to meet the objectives set by the Security\r\nCouncil, in agreement with the Tribunal itself? Several\r\napproaches have already been undertaken in just a few\r\nweeks. The Judges, first of all, are empowered to create\r\nprovisions allowing for the referral of certain cases to\r\nthe national courts. And this is why I appeared before\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nFrom a constitutional standpoint, does our statute\r\nmake it possible for us to refer a certain number of\r\ncases? The answer is yes. And so, we the Judges, in\r\nconsultation with the Prosecutor, went ahead and\r\nmodified our own rules of procedure and evidence,\r\nmaking it possible for this referral process to be carried\r\nout. So, from that standpoint, the Tribunal is ready.\r\nI also met with the presiding Judges of the three\r\nTrial Chambers and began to examine with each of\r\nthem the cases which could be referred to national\r\ncourts, if need be.\r\nAnd, lastly, the Prosecutor continued her\r\nevaluation of investigations that have been ongoing\r\nsince the beginning of the year in order to determine\r\nhow many individuals should be tried by the\r\nInternational Tribunal and how many by the national\r\ncourts. I will, of course, specify which ones.\r\nIn the final analysis, the referral of certain\r\ncases  and you, representatives of the Assembly, will\r\nagree with me  will be possible only if the national\r\ncourts have all of the resources required for trying war\r\ncriminals. When I talk about resources, I am not\r\ntalking about financial resources; I am also talking\r\nabout legal resources. Furthermore, we must be sure\r\nthat if we refer cases to the national courts, we must do\r\nso knowing that the mission entrusted to us by the\r\nSecurity Council will not give flea market value \r\nforgive me for using that crude expression  to our\r\ncases if we are not absolutely convinced that those\r\naccused will be judged by the international standards to\r\nwhich we in this forum are all committed, and no one\r\nmore so than you yourselves, Member States of the\r\nAssembly.\r\nNow who are the other involved players in this\r\nstrategy? It is the competent authorities on the national\r\nlevel.\r\nI wish to remind you  and this is the opinion of\r\nthe Prosecutor as well  that only courts in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina should for the time being be involved in\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nthe referral of cases. That said, while we were in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Madam del Ponte and I\r\nmyself observed that, despite the return to peace and\r\nthe gradual re-establishment of democratic institutions\r\nin that country, the local courts were faced with\r\nsubstantial structural difficulties. Moreover, it will take\r\nseveral years before the far-reaching efforts undertaken\r\nby the Office of the High Representative to reform the\r\nStates judicial system can be completed.\r\nIn order to enable the Tribunal to implement its\r\nprogramme at the earliest possible opportunity  by\r\nwhich I mean, to commence the referral of certain\r\ncases by 2003  an interim solution has been\r\nidentified. This solution consists of establishing a\r\nchamber with special jurisdiction to try serious\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law within a\r\nnational court already in place, in this instance, the\r\nState Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In other words,\r\nat the time of putting a State or national court into\r\nplace, there would be a special section or chamber\r\ndealing with war crimes. In order to guarantee the\r\nimpartiality and independence of that chamber, it\r\nwould be provisionally  and I do emphasize\r\nprovisionally - composed of international judges\r\nwho would assist the local judges. This solution has\r\nmany advantages. For one thing, it has the advantage of\r\navoiding the inconveniences of referring our cases to\r\njurisdictions that are unable or unwilling to try these\r\ncases, whether it be the Croat-Muslim Federation or the\r\nRepublika Srpska. This is our current view. I say this\r\noutright.\r\nIt goes without saying that, in order to set the\r\nspecialized chamber in place, concerted action is\r\nrequired on the part of all the competent authorities in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. They are the High\r\nRepresentative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, who must\r\nalready bear the heavy responsibility of fighting\r\norganized crime and stabilizing the countrys economy;\r\nthe local judicial authorities, who are the primary\r\nplayers; and also the international community, whose\r\nfinancial, logistical and legal support are vital.\r\nThe Tribunal is aware that this is not an easy task.\r\nNevertheless  and I reiterate this here before the\r\nAssembly  such concerted action is the sine qua non\r\nfor the effective implementation of the referral process\r\nand, as such, for the accomplishment of our mandate\r\nwithin the prescribed time frames. Very recently, the\r\nOffice of the High Representative confirmed to me that\r\nthe goal of establishing this specialized chamber by\r\n2003 was still on track, provided, inter alia, that the\r\nnecessary financial support was forthcoming.\r\nMay I, from this rostrum, express some\r\nconfusion, because the High Representative came\r\nbefore the Security Council last week and was not very\r\nexplicit on this question. We will be discussing this\r\nagain. I believe there is a need for there to be clear and\r\nunambiguous discussions in this regard. It is my firm\r\nbelief that the establishment within the State Court of a\r\nspecialized chamber for jurisdiction over violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law must be supported. And\r\nI ask you to support it. All means must be provided so\r\nthat the chamber can function effectively.\r\nThe establishment of a deep-rooted and lasting\r\npeace in the former Yugoslavia will become a reality\r\nonly once all the war criminals that are accused before\r\nthat jurisdiction are brought to trial. In any event, such\r\nis the meaning of the International Tribunals mission,\r\nunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.\r\nI have spoken to you of the responsibilities of the\r\nTribunal and of the responsibilities of the competent\r\nauthorities at the national level. I would like to\r\nconclude by referring to the responsibilities of the\r\ninternational community towards this Tribunal.\r\nI would like to recall that the Tribunal will not be\r\nable to accomplish its mandate within the anticipated\r\ntime frames unless the Member States, and especially\r\nthose created out of the former Yugoslavia, arrest and\r\nbring before the International Tribunal the accused in\r\ntheir territory and, further, hand over all of the\r\nevidence in their possession. As I indicated previously,\r\nthe Tribunal has taken all of the measures necessary for\r\nthe practical implementation of its programme of\r\naction. However, the Tribunal is not alone in this\r\nimportant endeavour. For the Tribunal to be able to\r\nconcentrate its work on the prosecution and trial of the\r\nmain political, military and civilian leaders, the States\r\nof the former Yugoslavia must also actively participate\r\nin their arrest and transfer to The Hague, as it is in this\r\nway  and this way alone  that we will be able to\r\naccomplish our mandate within the anticipated time\r\nframe.\r\nThe cooperation of the States  and those\r\nparticular States  is, therefore, essential and remains\r\none of my major concerns. Henceforth  and I want to\r\nbe very clear about this  I will not hesitate to refer to\r\nthe competent authorities the failure of any State to\r\nmeet its international obligations. My predecessors\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nhave done this, and as you know, I myself have done so\r\nvery recently.\r\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the Tribunal\r\nwill enter its tenth year of existence in 2003. We must\r\nthus examine the results of this institutions activities\r\nmore than ever, and do so uncompromisingly. I am not\r\nspeaking in terms of an anniversary, but in terms of a\r\ntime to assess our work. I have endeavoured today to\r\ndemonstrate to the Assembly that international criminal\r\njustice is possible. Yet, for such justice to flourish, it is\r\nalso important to underscore the vital character of the\r\ncollective action that must be taken by the international\r\ncommunity, which is represented here, while never\r\nforgetting the voice of the victims and the ultimate goal\r\nof reconciliation among peoples.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Denmark, who will speak on behalf of\r\nthe European Union.\r\nMs. Løj (Denmark): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The Central and\r\nEastern European countries associated with the\r\nEuropean Union  Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia  and the associated countries\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Association countries members of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein,\r\nalign themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union would like to once again\r\nexpress its strong support for the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The\r\nTribunals establishment in 1993 marked a significant\r\nstep forward in the progressive development of\r\ninternational criminal law and opened up an entirely\r\nnew field of United Nations action. The Tribunal has\r\nbeen and remains an important element in the\r\ninternational communitys strategy for restoring peace,\r\nsecurity and the rule of law in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nThe impact of the Tribunal will go far beyond the\r\nregion of the Balkans. By providing innovative and\r\nconstructive ideas on how to make international\r\ncriminal justice work, the Tribunal paved the way for\r\nthe International Criminal Court, the first permanent\r\ninternational structure to combat impunity for the most\r\nserious crimes that are of concern to the international\r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nThe Tribunal and the Court serve as eloquent\r\nexamples of the determination of the international\r\ncommunity to combat impunity. Under no\r\ncircumstances shall perpetrators of serious violations\r\nof international humanitarian law enjoy impunity, no\r\nmatter their rank, position or citizenship.\r\nThe European Union takes note with great\r\nsatisfaction of the efforts of the Tribunal to continue\r\nthe process of structural and operational reforms\r\ninitiated in 2001 to seek the expeditious resolution of\r\nthe cases before it in order to be able to finish its\r\nremaining tasks by 2010.\r\nInternally, the Appeals Chamber has been\r\nreorganized over the last year by strengthening the\r\nstructural ties with the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor Rwanda. The introduction of ad litem judges has\r\nbeen particularly worthwhile. Their services have\r\nallowed the Tribunal to conduct more trials in parallel.\r\nExternally, the Tribunal has focused on its completion\r\nstrategy with the intention of finishing investigations\r\nby 2004, completing trial activities at first instance by\r\n2008 and bringing to an end all Appeals cases by 2010,\r\nthus fulfilling its mandate. The European Union\r\nsupports the Tribunals ongoing efforts to concentrate\r\nits work on the prosecution and trial of civilian,\r\nmilitary and paramilitary leaders, who bear the greatest\r\nresponsibility.\r\nWe have noted with interest the strategy of the\r\nTribunal to transfer cases involving intermediary and\r\nlower-level accused to competent national\r\njurisdictions, as endorsed by the Security Council. We\r\nencourage the States in the region to make efforts to\r\nfacilitate such transfers, inter alia, by providing the\r\nnecessary legal framework for the trials to be\r\nconducted in a fair manner. The Tribunal will wish to\r\nsatisfy itself that the national jurisdictions, which will\r\nreceive transferred cases, have the capacity, the\r\ncompetence and the independence to properly\r\ninvestigate such cases within an acceptable timeframe\r\nand that the interests of victims and witnesses will be\r\nproperly safeguarded.\r\nThe reforms demonstrate the Tribunals ability to\r\ncope with and adjust to the challenges before it. But\r\ndespite the remarkable work carried out thus far, a lot\r\nremains to be done: persons on remand are awaiting\r\ntrial, investigations have yet to be conducted and\r\narrests need to be made. The Tribunal must spare no\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nefforts in seeking to complete its task as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nThe European Union notes that the successes of\r\nthe Tribunal have been achieved at significantly\r\nincreasing cost. The report of the auditors in respect of\r\nthe biennium 2000/2001 suggests that there is\r\nconsiderable room for improvement in management\r\ncontrol and enhanced budgetary efficiency. We look\r\nforward to learning more on how the Tribunal has\r\naddressed the auditors recommendations.\r\nFull cooperation of all States is a vital\r\nprecondition for the ability of the Tribunal to adhere to\r\nthe goals set out in its completion strategy. The\r\nEuropean Union urges all Governments to live up to\r\ntheir international obligation to cooperate fully with the\r\nTribunal, regardless of their domestic legislation.\r\nFull cooperation on all aspects of the work of the\r\nTribunal constitutes a non-negotiable requirement of\r\ninternational law, whether it is required in relation to\r\nthe location, arrest and transfer of indictees or to\r\nsecuring access to witnesses, documents, archives or\r\nother evidence.\r\nNevertheless, States cooperation with the\r\nTribunal remains problematic. Many national\r\nauthorities in the former Yugoslavia continue to\r\nprovide only the minimum in terms of cooperation. The\r\ncontinuing impunity of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko\r\nMladic, indicted on counts of genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity and war crimes, must be brought to an end. It\r\nis also high time that Ante Gotovina and Janko\r\nBobetko, indicted on counts of crimes against humanity\r\nand war crimes, are arrested and transferred to the\r\nTribunal by the Croatian authorities. Finally, the lack\r\nof cooperation on the part of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia with regard to witnesses and archives, and\r\nits failure to track down, arrest and transfer indictees,\r\nare totally unacceptable, and has led the Tribunal to\r\nreport the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the\r\nSecurity Council for continued non-cooperation.\r\nThe European Union urges the Governments and\r\nother relevant authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nCroatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to\r\ncooperate immediately and fully with the Tribunal.\r\nFailure to cooperate fully with the Tribunal would\r\nseriously jeopardize further movement of those\r\ncountries towards the European Union. The European\r\nUnion will keep close contact with the Tribunal on\r\nthose matters and continue to closely follow the\r\ndevelopments.\r\nI should not wish to end without thanking all the\r\nbranches of the Tribunal  the Chambers, the Registry\r\nand the Office of the Prosecutor  for their continuing\r\nendeavours. They provide essential contributions to\r\npeace and security in the region by ushering in justice\r\nand facilitating reconciliation, and they can rest\r\nassured of the full support and cooperation of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nNorway.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Let me begin by expressing\r\nour full recognition of the achievements and the high\r\nstandards of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), as reflected in various\r\njudgements, as well as in the report before us. We\r\nwould like to thank the President of the Tribunal for\r\nthe detailed annual report.\r\nThe work of the Tribunal has become a widely\r\nrecognized contribution to the search for truth and the\r\nfight against impunity for the most serious crimes of\r\ninternational concern. Thus, it can assist in the process\r\nof rebuilding civil society under the rule of law. The\r\nperiod under consideration coincides with the historic\r\nestablishment of the worlds first permanent\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). That marks yet\r\nanother milestone in the essential process of making\r\ninternational criminal justice work, thus motivating\r\nStates to fulfil their duty to bring those who have\r\ncommitted atrocities to justice.\r\nIn that regard, the judgements of the Tribunal\r\nrepresent essential contributions to international\r\njurisprudence with regard to the prosecution of the\r\nmost serious international crimes. The continuing work\r\nof the ad hoc Tribunals also paves the way for the\r\nfuture work of the International Criminal Court.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the Tribunal now is\r\noperating at full capacity, and that both internal and\r\nexternal reforms have been successfully implemented,\r\nleading to a remarkable increase in its judicial activity,\r\nnot least thanks to the arrival of nine ad litem judges.\r\nBearing in mind the need to prepare for the foreseeable\r\nrise in the number of cases on appeal, we especially\r\nwelcome the arrival of two additional judges in the\r\nAppeals Chamber, as well as the implementation of\r\nmeans to strengthen the structural links between the\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nAppeals Chambers of the International Tribunal and the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The latter\r\nmeasure will guarantee that the case law of the Appeals\r\nChambers is consistent, and it will simplify the work of\r\nthe judges and staff in the Chambers.\r\nHowever, certain financial and management\r\nissues, mainly related to defence counsel and legal aid,\r\nare still a cause of concern for us. We note, however,\r\nthe Tribunals efforts to deal with those problems, and\r\nwe would welcome in that regard the creation of an\r\ninternational criminal bar. The bar would have powers\r\nto enforce, inter alia, the substantive amendments and\r\nadditions to the code of professional conduct for\r\ndefence counsel, including an explicit prohibition of\r\nfee-splitting and more detailed rules on conflicts of\r\ninterest. In addition, the changes made to the Directive\r\non Assignment of Defence Counsel, including the\r\nsimplification of the legal aid payment system and the\r\nprohibition of the assignment as member of a defence\r\nteam of relatives and friends of the accused or of\r\ncounsel, are also important in that regard. Both as a\r\nfurther preventive measure against potential fee-\r\nsplitting and for cost-saving purposes, we urge the\r\nTribunal to thoroughly consider the recommendations\r\nof the Board of Auditors to lower the indigence\r\nthreshold and to establish a limit on the amount of\r\nlegal aid that may be provided for the duration of the\r\nproceedings.\r\nIt is evident that the ICTY alone cannot carry out\r\nall the work required to restore and to maintain peace\r\nin the former Yugoslavia. The Tribunal will not be able\r\nto try all the perpetrators of serious violations of\r\nhumanitarian law committed during a conflict that\r\nlasted more than five years. The Tribunals completion\r\nstrategy, as endorsed by the Security Council, seems in\r\npractice to be the best way of enabling the Tribunal to\r\nachieve its objective of completing all first instance\r\ntrials by 2008.\r\nTransferring cases involving intermediary-level\r\naccused to the competent national jurisdictions paves\r\nthe way for the ICTY to fully concentrate on trying\r\nthose who bear the greatest responsibility for the\r\ncrimes committed. Leaving it to domestic courts to try\r\nthe subordinates who carried out the orders would\r\nfurther help to reconstruct a national identity in the\r\nregion. In that process, we must allow for sufficient\r\nflexibility in order to ensure that no perpetrator can\r\ngamble on impunity based on the provisional nature of\r\nthe Tribunal.\r\nTo a large extent, the success of the Tribunal in\r\nthe discharge of its mandate lies in the hands of\r\nMember States. It is encouraging that 23 accused,\r\nalmost three times the number for the previous\r\nreporting period, either surrendered voluntarily or were\r\narrested during the period under consideration. We\r\nregret, however, that problems in international\r\ncooperation remain a major obstacle for the Tribunal in\r\naccomplishing the reforms that have already been\r\nimplemented and those under consideration, and thus in\r\ncompleting its mandate. The arrest and subsequent\r\ntransfer of former President Slobodan Milosevic to The\r\nHague were a landmark in the field of international\r\ncriminal justice. The transfer makes clear that no\r\nindividual is above the law, regardless of his or her\r\nposition. All authorities throughout the former\r\nYugoslavia must now recognize that the duty to\r\ncooperate with the Tribunal in accordance with the\r\nbinding decisions of the Security Council is non-\r\nnegotiable.\r\nIt is critical to the success of the Tribunal that the\r\npeople of the region be informed about its work and\r\nunderstand its significance. It is our hope and belief\r\nthat this is happening, albeit gradually. An important\r\ninitiative taken by the Tribunal in this regard is the\r\nOutreach Programme, which provides accurate and\r\ntopical information on the ICTY and its activities to the\r\npeople of the former Yugoslavia. In the light of the\r\nTribunals completion strategy, the role played by the\r\nProgramme in tracking developments and reforms in\r\ndomestic criminal justice systems is also becoming\r\nincreasingly relevant. Norway welcomes the expanded\r\nactivities and continuous development of the Outreach\r\nProgramme. During the period under review, Norway\r\nhas donated almost 100,000 euros to the Outreach\r\nProgramme. We encourage all States to support\r\nactively the continued work of bringing the judicial\r\nprocess closer to the public in order to promote greater\r\ninsight, which may be an important factor in achieving\r\nlong-term peace and reconciliation in the area.\r\nWe appeal to all States to demonstrate, not only\r\nin words but also in practice, their fullest cooperation\r\nwith the Tribunal by surrendering indictees, providing\r\nfull and effective assistance with regard to witnesses,\r\ngiving financial and material support and, not least,\r\nproviding practical assistance in the enforcement of\r\nsentences. The Norwegian Government has\r\ndemonstrated its willingness to consider applications\r\nfrom the Tribunal concerning the enforcement of\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nsentences and subsequently, in conformity with\r\nnational laws, to receive a limited number of convicted\r\npersons to serve their sentences in Norway. We\r\nencourage other States to prove their continued\r\ncommitment to the work of the Tribunal through\r\nconcrete action in this crucial field.\r\nAs we are convinced of the need to ensure that no\r\none gambles on enjoying impunity for acts of genocide,\r\nother crimes against humanity or serious war crimes,\r\nthe Assembly may rest assured that we will stand by\r\nour long-term commitment to the successful fulfilment\r\nof the mandate of the ICTY.\r\nMr. Cheah (Malaysia): I would first like to join\r\nother delegations in expressing appreciation to Judge\r\nClaude Jorda, President of the International Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), for introducing the\r\nreport of the Tribunal (A/57/379) to the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMalaysia is gratified that the process of reform of\r\nthe Tribunal, started in 2000 in all of its three organs, is\r\nwell under way. We are pleased to note that the number\r\nof judges has increased from 22 to 25 since last year \r\nwith 16 permanent judges, including 2 from the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)\r\nwho are serving in the Tribunals Appeal Chambers and\r\nwith 9 ad litem judges on the roster. The Tribunal is\r\nnow operating at full capacity by optimally utilizing\r\nthe Three Trial chambers, conducting six simultaneous\r\nfirst instance trials daily. These positive developments\r\nwill certainly further enhance the capability of the\r\nTribunal.\r\nMy delegation also noted that on 23 July this\r\nyear, at a closed meeting of the Security Council, Judge\r\nJorda presented for the consideration of the Council a\r\nbroad programme of action with regard to the future\r\ndirection of the Tribunal in order to fulfil its mandate\r\nof completing all first instance trial activities by 2008.\r\nThe Council endorsed the broad strategy\r\nrecommendations presented by Judge Jorda including\r\nthe recommendation to transfer intermediary-level and\r\nlower-level criminal cases to competent national\r\njurisdictions. Malaysia welcomes this development as\r\nwell as the observation made by the Council on the\r\nneed to further study the proposal to establish a special\r\nchamber in the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe are of the view that the broad strategy will further\r\nfacilitate their expeditious implementation of the\r\nmandate of the Tribunal. Nevertheless, it is important\r\nto ensure that the local courts are well prepared and\r\nequipped to handle such cases.\r\nThe Tribunal was established to, among other\r\nreasons, bring to justice persons allegedly responsible\r\nfor violations of international humanitarian law and to\r\ncontribute to the restoration of peace by promoting\r\nreconciliation in the former Yugoslavia.\r\nThe Council and the Tribunal must exercise the\r\nutmost care so that the reform process is not\r\nimplemented at the expense of achieving these\r\nimportant objectives. It is also pertinent to seek the\r\nviews of the countries concerned. Malaysia is confident\r\nthat, together, the Council and the Tribunal are taking\r\nthe correct approach on this matter.\r\nIt has been almost a decade since the Tribunal\r\nwas established. Malaysia is pleased to learn that a\r\ntotal of 78 cases have appeared before the Tribunal, of\r\nwhich 30 cases have been completed. However, we are\r\nvery concerned that 20 publicly indicted persons still\r\nremain at large, including the major indicted war\r\ncriminals, particularly, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko\r\nMladic. We strongly hope that this matter will be\r\naddressed as expeditiously as possible.\r\nThe continued freedom with impunity of such\r\nmajor characters will not only preclude the Tribunal\r\nfrom concluding its work within the allotted time\r\nframe, but also impede the meting out of justice and\r\nthe reconciliation process in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nMalaysia reiterates that the mandate of the Tribunal\r\nwould not be considered complete without the\r\napprehension and the trial of major indicted war\r\ncriminals, most of whom are believed to be hiding in\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republika\r\nSrpska.\r\nIn this regard, Malaysia views with concern the\r\nletter addressed to the President of the Security Council\r\nby Judge Jorda regarding the failure of the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia to cooperate with the Tribunal.\r\nWe commend Judge Jordas letter and reiterate the\r\nimportance of the Tribunal receiving the necessary\r\nsupport and cooperation of all the parties concerned in\r\nthe implementation of its mandate. We also urge the\r\nauthorities in Republika Srpska to cooperate fully with\r\nthe Tribunal in this regard.\r\nWhile we acknowledge that the political will of\r\nStates is needed in apprehending these indicted war\r\ncriminals, the international community, especially the\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nSecurity Council, must also show determination in\r\nrendering full assistance to the Tribunal. In this regard,\r\nwe note with concern the comment made by the Head\r\nof the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina at the Council meeting on 23 October\r\n2002, regarding the limited mandate of the\r\nStabilization Force on this issue. We hope therefore\r\nthat the Council and all parties concerned would give\r\nserious thought to this matter in order to assist the\r\nTribunal in carrying out its work of rendering justice to\r\nthe victims of war and crimes against humanity in the\r\nformer Yugoslavia.\r\nWe wish also to take this opportunity to express\r\nour profound appreciation to the outgoing Judges for\r\ntheir outstanding service to the Tribunal on behalf of\r\nthe international community and humanity in general.\r\nIn reiterating its fullest support for the Tribunal,\r\nMalaysia calls once again on the international\r\ncommunity to give all-out and sustained support to the\r\nTribunal in carrying out its mandate.\r\nMr. imonović (Croatia): As we welcome the\r\nentry into force of the permanent International\r\nCriminal Court less than ten years since the adoption of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 827 (1993), there can be no\r\ndoubt that the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), together with the Rwanda\r\nTribunal, played a crucial role in this evolution of\r\ninternational criminal justice. Over the last nine years,\r\nthe two ad hoc Tribunals have significantly advanced\r\nthe development and enforcement of international\r\ncriminal law by shaping new legal standards,\r\nstrengthening the rule of law and bringing justice to the\r\nvictims.\r\nHowever, as we are rightly reminded in the\r\nreports conclusions, there is yet another dimension to\r\nthe Tribunals role  that of establishing a reliable\r\nrecord of the past events. For the countries in the\r\nregion and for their future, the political and historical\r\naccount established through the Tribunals\r\njurisprudence is equally as important as the punishment\r\nof the perpetrators.\r\nBecause of its legal, political, historical and\r\neducational importance, the trial of Slobodan Milosevic\r\nis central to the ICTY. It is an opportunity to establish a\r\nframework and identify a context within which all\r\nindividual crimes in the former Yugoslavia have been\r\ncommitted. Regretfully, the non-chronological\r\nsequencing of the trial  which began with charges\r\nrelated to Kosovo, rather than Croatia and Bosnia \r\ncreates problems with respect to the reconstruction of\r\nthe logic of the events related to the charges, thus\r\nfailing to establish a coherent political and historical\r\nrecord.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia attaches utmost\r\nimportance to the successful completion of the\r\nTribunals mandate. We support the work of the ICTY\r\nand we closely cooperate with it. As the report\r\ncorrectly notes, the Prosecutor maintains constant\r\ndialogue with the Croatian authorities, which have\r\nopened its archives and handed over more than 10,000\r\ndocuments, and ensured access to all witnesses. Only\r\nin recent weeks Croatia has received and fulfilled half-\r\na-dozen requests related to various investigations.\r\nThe most telling example of Croatias\r\ncommitment is undoubtedly the recent testimony of the\r\nPresident of Croatia before the ICTY in the trial\r\nagainst Milosevic. As the first head of State ever to\r\nappear before the Trial Chamber of an international\r\nwar crimes tribunal in a case against a former president\r\nof another State, President Mesić helped to create\r\nanother important precedent in international criminal\r\nadjudication.\r\nIn this spirit of co-operation, Croatia was also\r\nvery open in expressing its concerns with regard to\r\nsome elements of the indictment against General\r\nBobetko, the former Chief of Staff of the Croatian\r\narmed forces. As certain factually and legally\r\nunfounded qualifications in that indictment risk some\r\nundesirable implications for the historical record of the\r\nevents that took place during the liberation war in\r\nCroatia, the Government decided to explore the legal\r\navenues available under the ICTYs Statute and the\r\nRules of Procedure and Evidence in order to challenge\r\nrespective parts of the indictment. It therefore\r\nsubmitted two interlocutory legal remedies, based on\r\nthe interpretation of relevant provisions of the Rules of\r\nProcedure and Evidence. The ICTY has already\r\nestablished an Appeals Chamber that will decide on the\r\ninterlocutory appeals. The Government of Croatia has\r\nmade it very clear that it will comply with the ruling of\r\nthe Appeals Chamber, which is expected in the\r\nfollowing weeks.\r\nA year ago the President and the Prosecutor of\r\nthe ICTY presented a plausible exit strategy for the\r\nTribunal. Various institutional and procedural\r\nimprovements undertaken over the past year should be\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\ncontinued, to ensure that the Prosecutor will finish its\r\ninvestigations by 2004, and that the Trial and Appeals\r\nChambers will finish their cases by 2008 and 2010.\r\nTaking into account the limited capacity of the ICTY\r\nand the need for national mechanisms to strengthen and\r\nensure respect for the rule of law, we welcome these\r\nefforts, in particular models of complementarity\r\njustice, relying on domestic courts elaborated before\r\nthe Security Council in July this year.\r\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, the new State Court\r\ncan take over specific cases, while the local courts\r\ncontinue to operate under the Rules of the Road\r\nprocedures. The Croatian judiciary, which is not bound\r\nby these rules, has independently initiated a number of\r\nproceedings against perpetrators of individual war\r\ncrimes against Croatian citizens, irrespective of their\r\nnationality.\r\nMr. Grey-Johnson (Gambia), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe recognize that concentrating on the highest-\r\nlevel perpetrators is a cornerstone of the exit strategy,\r\nand we support this approach. However, any attempt to\r\ncreate an artificial balance between all parties to the\r\nconflict should be prevented for the sake of\r\nestablishing a reliable historical record. The work of\r\nthe Tribunal should accurately reflect the extent and\r\nlevel of involvement in war crimes of individuals on\r\ndifferent sides of the conflict.\r\nThe command responsibility introduced by the\r\nTribunal should be applied to the highest level actively\r\ninvolved in planning and commanding genocide,\r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes, without\r\nturning it into objective responsibility, which could\r\ngenerally be attached to the leadership of any country\r\ninvolved in armed conflict.\r\nRegarding the importance of the apprehension of\r\nthe highest-level war crimes perpetrators, we are\r\nencouraged by the statement made by Mr. Jacques Paul\r\nKlein in the Security Council last week calling for a\r\nclear Stabilization Force (SFOR) mandate to find and\r\napprehend Radovan Karadzic. We sincerely hope that\r\nthe Security Council will act accordingly.\r\nMr. ahović (Yugoslavia): Allow me at the outset\r\nto thank the President of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for his\r\npresentation of the Tribunals annual report, which we\r\nhave studied carefully. The report testifies to the very\r\nactive work of the Tribunal over the past year, both\r\nwithin the Trial and Appeals Chambers but also in\r\nother aspects of its activities. In this regard, I would\r\nlike to make a few comments.\r\nWe welcome the Tribunals structural reforms,\r\nincluding its exit strategy, which should ensure that the\r\nfirst-instance trials are completed by 2008 and the\r\nremaining workload finished two years later. Indeed, as\r\nan ad hoc institution, the Tribunal has to have a time-\r\nframe to fulfil its mandate. The ICTYs intention to\r\nfocus on the most serious crimes and to refer other\r\ncases to the national courts is, we believe, a good\r\napproach.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to emphasize the\r\nimportance of the establishment of a special Chamber\r\nto try war crimes within the State Court of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina as part of a policy to improve the\r\ncapabilities of national jurisdictions to take over such\r\ncases. However, we consider that this concept of\r\nreferral of cases should in future apply to all States\r\nunder ICTY jurisdiction. We in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia are making efforts to reform our judiciary\r\nin order to strengthen its capabilities to deal with these\r\ncomplex and serious cases.\r\nOn another issue of a more general nature, allow\r\nme to draw the Assemblys attention to the fact that\r\nneither the Statute nor the Rules of Procedure and\r\nEvidence of the ICTY provides for compensation for\r\npersons held in the custody of the Tribunal and\r\nsubsequently acquitted. My Government believes that\r\nit would be appropriate and fair to offer the remedy\r\nprovided for in the national legislation of many States,\r\nincluding our own. If compensation were provided to\r\nindividuals held in custody and later acquitted, it would\r\ngreatly contribute to the fairness of the treatment of\r\nindictees.\r\nI would also like to touch upon the work of one\r\nspecific program of the ICTY  the Outreach Program\r\ndesigned for peoples in regions of the former\r\nYugoslavia. In order to successfully fulfil its mandate,\r\nthe ICTY should make additional efforts to be\r\nperceived and recognized as a just, impartial and non-\r\npolitical body that applies equal standards to all who\r\nfall within its jurisdiction.\r\nAs indicated in the report before us, cooperation\r\nbetween the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the\r\nICTY is a complicated and complex process. In this\r\ncontext, we would recall that the present Government\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nof Yugoslavia took office less than two years ago.\r\nDuring that period, cooperation with the Tribunal,\r\nwhich had been virtually non-existent, constantly\r\nimproved and intensified. Allow me to give just a few\r\nconcrete examples.\r\nAs many as 14 indicted persons were transferred\r\nfrom the territory of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia into the custody of the ICTY, nine of them\r\nwithin the reporting period. Besides former President\r\nSlobodan Milosevic, whose trial marked the work of\r\nthe ICTY in the past year, those persons included the\r\nformer Chief of General Staff of the Army of\r\nYugoslavia and the Federal Minister of Defence, the\r\nformer Federal Deputy Prime Minister, several high-\r\nranking military officers and a number of suspects from\r\nRepublika Srpska. The Yugoslav courts have issued\r\nwarrants for an additional 17 accused persons whose\r\narrest has been sought by the ICTY.\r\nIn early April this year, the Federal Parliament\r\npassed a law on cooperation with the Tribunal. A\r\nNational Council for Cooperation with the ICTY has\r\nbeen established, headed by the Federal Foreign\r\nMinister. We are aware that some of the provisions of\r\nthis law need improvement, and we are currently\r\nseeking to deal with this issue. However, my\r\nGovernment would like to emphasize that those\r\nprovisions have not in practice so far been an obstacle\r\nto cooperation.\r\nThus far, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has\r\nresponded to 34 requests to provide documents sought\r\nby the ICTY Prosecutor, including full reports from 17\r\nsessions of the Supreme Defence Council and from the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army of Yugoslavia.\r\nAs far as access to witnesses is concerned, the\r\nGovernments of Yugoslavia and Serbia have provided\r\nthe requested information on as many as 100 witnesses\r\nand suspects. More than 30 former and current State\r\nofficials and employees were authorized to testify,\r\nincluding on matters that constitute military and State\r\nsecrets. Among them were the former President of the\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Chief of\r\nthe General Staff of the Army of Yugoslavia.\r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor itself has recently\r\npointed that the Government of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia increased the number of its responses to\r\nrequests for documents and access to witnesses.\r\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize that the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia believes that all individuals\r\nresponsible for international crimes should be brought\r\nto justice, either before international courts such as the\r\nICTY or before national courts. My Government\r\nrecognizes its obligation to cooperate with the ICTY\r\nand will continue to do so. I am confident that the trend\r\nof improvement and strengthening in the cooperation\r\nbetween the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the\r\nICTY that we have witnessed over the past two years\r\nwill continue in future.\r\nMr. Kusljugić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): The\r\nGovernment of Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the\r\nreport of the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nformer Yugoslavia (ICTY), presented to the General\r\nAssembly by the President of the Tribunal, Judge\r\nClaude Jorda, and commends the achievements\r\nregistered by the Tribunal over the past year.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank both\r\nPresident Jorda and Chief Prosecutor Mrs. Del Ponte\r\nfor their clear and straightforward statements on the\r\nTribunals current efforts and future plans, which they\r\nhave articulated in their reports.\r\nThe presidency and Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina fully support the activities of the ICTY,\r\nnot only by words but also by deeds. We believe that\r\nthe ICTY plays a substantial role in the processes of\r\nreconciliation and of the maintenance of stability and\r\npeace, both in my country and in South-eastern Europe.\r\nWe also underline the role of the Tribunal in the\r\nindividualization of war crimes as a precondition for\r\nsustainable inter-ethnic reconciliation in the region as a\r\nwhole.\r\nRecently, Biljana Plavsic, one of the\r\nhighest-ranking persons indicted for crimes against\r\nhumanity by the United Nations Tribunal, not only\r\npleaded guilty, but also expressed remorse to the\r\nvictims for her role in the persecution and deportation\r\nof countless Muslims and Croats. Such a gesture\r\nshould be considered a milestone in the reconciliation\r\nprocess. We also agree that the apprehension and trial\r\nof high-level perpetrators should be the primary role of\r\nthe Tribunal.\r\nCitizens, especially war crime victims and\r\nwitnesses in my country, have carefully followed the\r\nwork of the ICTY, reflecting the impact it has had on\r\ntheir everyday lives. Many families, in all ethnic\r\ngroups in the region, especially in Bosnia and\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nHerzegovina, suffered during the 1991-1995 war. In the\r\npast year numerous new mass graves have been\r\ndiscovered, bearing witness to the scale of the crimes\r\ncommitted. Each verdict of the Tribunal helps to\r\nalleviate the pain and suffering of the victims and their\r\nfamilies. For many in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nICTYs activities represent the only hope that justice\r\nwill eventually be done. The trial against Slobodan\r\nMilosevic, whose indictment includes the crime of\r\ngenocide committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is\r\nbeing followed with special attention, since it is\r\nexpected that new, substantial evidence about the root\r\ncauses of the conflict in the region will be unveiled.\r\nWar criminals are symbols for the use of violence\r\nin achieving political goals. Hence, they present a\r\nsource of continued instability in the region. That is\r\nwhy we are very disappointed and seriously concerned\r\nby the fact that 20 publicly indicted war criminals still\r\nremain at large. Last year, when I addressed this\r\nAssembly, there were 26 indicted persons at large. The\r\nfact that today there are 20 indicted persons at large is\r\nnot a sign of success. The fact that publicly indicted\r\nwar criminals, especially Radovan Karadzic and Ratko\r\nMladic, remain not only at large, but also in a position\r\nto influence the political situation in my country, is a\r\nsign that their political programmes, based on the\r\ntheory of ethnically clean territories, are still alive.\r\nThe evidence of public unrest with regard to the\r\nwork of the ICTY, which has recently been recorded, as\r\nwell as the well-known fact that some indicted war\r\ncriminals are considered to be heroes among a\r\nsubstantial part of the population in all countries in the\r\nregion, clearly shows that the nationalists, who\r\nstrongly oppose ICTY activities, are still operational.\r\nWe agree that a lasting and stable peace in the\r\nBalkans will not be achieved unless the Tribunal brings\r\nto justice all indicted high-level individuals. We also\r\nconsider that the leading role of the international\r\ncommunity regarding the arrests of these individuals is\r\nof crucial importance. It has already been shown that\r\nlocal political parties and Governments fully cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal only when they are forced to do so\r\nunder consistent international pressure. The\r\ncommitment of the international community to support\r\nthe work of the Tribunal, both financially and\r\npolitically, will be proof of its credibility in the region.\r\nIts readiness to give the utmost priority to making\r\narrests of indicted war criminals will be proof of its\r\ncommitment to universally accepted ethics and moral\r\nvalues.\r\nWe in Bosnia and Herzegovina have experienced\r\ncrimes against humanity that should not, and never\r\ncould, be forgotten. Mass murder, detention camps, the\r\nhumiliation and torture of civilians, systematic mass\r\nrape, ethnic cleansing and even genocide were the\r\nBosnian reality for more than three years at the end of\r\nthe twentieth century. As a result of those experiences,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina made a special commitment to\r\nthe establishment of the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC). Our hope is that, in addition to carrying out its\r\nprimary function  bringing to justice individuals\r\nresponsible for the most serious crimes  the ICC will\r\nbe able to act preventively in order to deter future war\r\ncrimes. It is our hope that the ICC will create greater\r\nawareness in the international community with respect\r\nto the principles of international criminal justice, as\r\nwell as accountability, which can play a significant role\r\nin the consolidation of peace and global stability.\r\nHowever, the ICC will use the same instruments as the\r\nICTY to bring to justice indicted persons. The ICTY\r\nhas so far not received the necessary support in the\r\napprehension of the high-level leaders and notorious\r\noffenders responsible for the most serious crimes. The\r\nineffectiveness of this process therefore is threatening\r\nto diminish the credibility of the ICC itself, even\r\nbefore it becomes operational.\r\nWe are aware that many more suspected war\r\ncriminals in the region must be prosecuted.\r\nConsidering the intention of the ICTY to try only high-\r\nlevel perpetrators, the Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina welcomes the Tribunals initiative for\r\nsome cases to be tried by the Court of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina under the auspices of the Tribunal.\r\nHowever, we expect that the apprehension and trial of\r\nthe most notorious offenders will remain the\r\nresponsibility of the international community and the\r\nUnited Nations, even after the conclusion of the current\r\nmandate of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 45.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this\r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 45.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nAgenda item 46\r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide\r\nand Other Serious Violations of International\r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of\r\nRwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for\r\nGenocide and Other Such Violations Committed in\r\nthe Territory of Neighbouring States between 1\r\nJanuary 1994 and 31 December 1994\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting\r\nthe seventh annual report of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal (A/57/163)\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the\r\nAssembly takes note of the seventh annual report of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda\r\n(A/57/163)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on Ms. Navanethem\r\nPillay, President of the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor Rwanda.\r\nMs. Pillay: It is my honour to present to the\r\nAssembly a report on the activities of the International\r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) for the year\r\n2001-2002.\r\nThe year has been marked by both progress and\r\ncrisis. To quote Charles Dickens, It was the best of\r\ntimes, it was the worst of times. (A Tale of Two Cities)\r\nDuring the year under review, the ICTR has been\r\nactively engaged in nine trials of 22 accused. Each of\r\nthe three Trial Chambers is conducting three trials\r\ncontemporaneously in shifts of two to six weeks for\r\neach trial. The system of conducting multiple trials is\r\nonerous for the judges, and entails elaborate planning\r\nand scheduling, in consultation with all parties\r\nconcerned, including some 60 defence counsel from\r\nvarious countries. Nevertheless, in the light of the large\r\nnumber of accused persons in custody, the lengthy\r\nperiod of their detention and the need to advance the\r\ndate of completion of the Tribunals mandate, the\r\njudges have been compelled to undertake many cases.\r\nIt must be observed that, while trials by shift allow\r\ntrials for a maximum number of accused, the\r\nconsequence is that the delivery of judgement in\r\ncompleted trials is prolonged, as judges spend more\r\ntime in the courtroom and have less time to concentrate\r\non the preparation of judgements.\r\nI am happy to report that we are now seeing the\r\nfruits of two years of pretrial preparation. Judgements\r\nin two trials of three accused persons  the\r\nNtakirutimana and Semanza trials  will be delivered\r\nbefore the end of this year and early next year,\r\nrespectively. In the following five trials, the\r\nprosecution has completed testimony and the Courts\r\nare hearing the defence case: in the Media trial, the\r\nprosecution called 47 witnesses over a period of 163\r\ndays, the defence commenced in September and we\r\nhave just heard three witnesses; in the Kajelijeli trial,\r\nthere were 15 prosecution witnesses and 11 defence\r\nwitnesses have testified; in the Kamuhanda trial, there\r\nwere 28 prosecution witnesses and seven defence\r\nwitnesses have testified; in the Cyangugu trial, 40\r\nwitnesses testified for the prosecution and 37 defence\r\nwitnesses have testified; and, in the Niyitigeka trial, 13\r\nprosecution witnesses testified and the defence\r\ncommenced its case in October. In the Military case of\r\nBagosora and in the Butare trial  totalling 10 accused\r\npersons  the prosecution case is being heard.\r\nFrom the foregoing, it will be observed that, at\r\nthe end of our second term of service, the number of\r\ncompleted trials will be significantly higher. The pace\r\nof the proceedings is slow, but the judges must be\r\nscrupulous in their observance of international fair-trial\r\nnorms, with full respect for the rights of accused\r\npersons. In that regard, I note that all of our\r\njudgements have survived the test of appeal.\r\nThe judges have continued to implement\r\nmeasures to enhance judicial functions and to expedite\r\ntrials. At plenary meetings of judges held in May and\r\nJuly this year, the progress of trials was reviewed and\r\nnew rules were adopted to further expedite trials and\r\nappeals. Some of those rules include rule 11 bis, which\r\nfacilitates the transfer of accused to national\r\njurisdictions to stand trial; rule 65 bis, which\r\nauthorizes the Trial Chamber or a judge to supervise\r\nexchanges between the parties to ensure expeditious\r\ntrial; rule 92 bis, which permits the admission of\r\nwritten statements as evidence in lieu of oral\r\ntestimony; and article 5 bis, which explicitly prohibits\r\nfee-splitting arrangements between counsel and client.\r\nThe judges have implemented measures for the\r\nexercise of greater judicial control over proceedings.\r\nThey have held pretrial and status conferences to\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nstreamline trial proceedings, to determine the number\r\nof witnesses and documents to be introduced as\r\nexhibits, and to place stipulations on the length of\r\nwitness testimony. The judges have ordered the non-\r\npayment of costs to assigned counsel as a way of\r\ndiscouraging frivolous motions and abuses of due\r\nprocess. Motions have been disposed of more\r\nexpeditiously by assigning motions to single judges\r\ninstead of to a full Chamber; by considering motions\r\non brief, instead of holding court hearings; and by\r\nrendering oral decisions on motions during trial and\r\nthereby limiting interruptions of testimony.\r\nDespite the best efforts of the judges and of all\r\nsupport sections, trials continue to be drawn out and\r\noften defy our plans to expedite proceedings. Let me\r\nshare with the Assembly some of the reasons for that.\r\nThe issues that emerge during a trial are legally and\r\nfactually very complex, often much more so than at the\r\nnational level. The accused are charged with\r\nconspiracy and with command responsibility; hence,\r\ntheir trials may involve as many as 100 witnesses and\r\nmay last several years. The interpretation of trial\r\nproceedings into three languages  namely,\r\nKinyarwanda, French and English  together with\r\ncultural and linguistic nuances and unique\r\ncharacteristics associated with understanding questions\r\nin Kinyarwanda, cause trial proceedings to double or\r\ntreble the time required compared with that required\r\nfor trials conducted in one language. In addition, there\r\nis a large volume of court documents, and delays occur\r\nin the translation and disclosure of such documents into\r\nthe three languages. Additional time is required for\r\ndefence counsel to investigate and prepare, to search\r\nfor and locate witnesses in many countries and in\r\nrefugee camps, and to accommodate their respective\r\nschedules accordingly. Counsel travel to Arusha from\r\nmany parts of the world. Delays are encountered in the\r\nappearance of witnesses  and, in some instances, the\r\nnon-appearance of witnesses  from Rwanda. Many\r\nStates have assisted the ICTR in arranging contact with\r\nand facilitating the travel of witnesses, even those who\r\nhave no travel documents. However, this year, the\r\nICTR has experienced difficulties with regard to the\r\nflow of witnesses from Rwanda. The non-appearance\r\nof witnesses from Rwanda has disrupted the careful\r\nplanning of the judicial calendar and is a severe\r\nsetback to judicial work.\r\nIn June 2002, Trial Chambers I and II drew the\r\nattention of the Rwandan authorities to their statutory\r\nobligation to cooperate with the ICTR and to facilitate\r\nthe travel of witnesses so that trials could continue.\r\nDespite such requests, witnesses were not sent, with\r\nthe result that the two trials had to be adjourned and 15\r\ntrial days were lost. On 26 July, I reported that lack of\r\ncooperation to the Security Council. I noted that the\r\nadministrative changes made by the Rwandan\r\nauthorities had led to the non-issue or the delayed issue\r\nof travel documents for Rwandan witnesses and that\r\nthe Rwandan Government was not observing its\r\nobligation to facilitate the appearance of prosecution\r\nand defence witnesses. The Rwandan Government\r\nappeared to have suspended its cooperation with the\r\nICTR, and I urged the Council to prevail upon the\r\nGovernment of Rwanda to restore the previous good\r\ncooperation that it had accorded to the ICTR over the\r\npast seven and-a-half years.\r\nAt present, trials are proceeding, but it is\r\npertinent to note that in five trials, the defence case is\r\nbeing presented and most of the defence witnesses\r\ncome from outside Rwanda. Of the 122 defence\r\nwitnesses who came before the ICTR this year, 20\r\ncame from Rwanda. The issue of the travel of\r\nwitnesses from Rwanda must be resolved so that trials\r\nhearing prosecution testimony may resume on time.\r\nI have invited the Minister of Justice and\r\nInstitutional Relations in Rwanda, the Honourable Jean\r\nde Dieu Mucyo, as well as the President of the\r\nSupreme Court and the Prosecutor General of Rwanda\r\nto visit the Tribunal in order to observe the judicial\r\nproceedings first-hand and to meet with us. I was very\r\nglad to learn this morning that the invitation will be\r\naccepted, and I wish to thank the Rwandan\r\nGovernment for that.\r\nI shall now give a brief overview of our cases.\r\nThe ICTR has indicted 81 persons; 62 persons are in\r\ncustody and 18 persons are still at large. Of the 62\r\npeople already arrested, eight have been sentenced, one\r\nhas been acquitted, 22 are involved in ongoing trials\r\nand 31 are in custody, awaiting the commencement of\r\ntheir trials. The Prosecutor has indicated that she is\r\nready for trial in seven cases, involving 13 of the 31\r\npersons in custody. However, the Trial Chambers are\r\ncurrently fully engaged and will be engaged in ongoing\r\ntrials of 22 accused persons until and beyond the\r\nexpiration of the judges term on 23 May 2003 and\r\ntherefore cannot undertake any new trials, including\r\nthe seven cases ready for trial. The accused are entitled\r\nto expeditious trials. The present lengthy period of pre-\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\ntrial detention is a matter of grave concern and does not\r\nbode well for the interests of justice. How are we\r\naddressing this concern?\r\nFirstly, the Prosecutor has revised her future\r\ninvestigation programme from the originally estimated\r\nnumber of 136 new suspects to 16 new suspects,\r\ntogether with 10 ongoing investigations. The resulting\r\n26 new indictments, which the Prosecutor intends to\r\nsubmit for confirmation by the end of the year 2004,\r\nwill conclude her investigation programme. In\r\naddition, the Prosecutor has identified 40 suspects\r\nwhose prosecution she intends to defer to national\r\njurisdictions for trial. Fifteen of these suspects are in\r\ncountries that have already adopted the principle of\r\nuniversal jurisdiction and these individuals could stand\r\ntrial in those countries. The cases of 25 other suspects\r\nwhom the Prosecutor has determined did not occupy\r\nhigh positions of responsibility could be transferred to\r\nthe Rwandan authorities.\r\nSecondly, a pool of ad litem judges has been\r\ncreated. In anticipation of a heavy workload for the\r\nTribunal, I submitted a proposal to the Security\r\nCouncil on 9 July 2001 for ad litem judges to increase\r\nthe judicial capacity of the ICTR. The Security Council\r\nadopted resolution 1431 (2002) on 14 August 2002,\r\nauthorizing a pool of 18 ad litem judges for the ICTR\r\nand the use of four ad litem judges at any one time.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to express our\r\nappreciation to the Security Council for providing this\r\nresource.\r\nThe four ad litem judges will, upon taking office\r\nsometime in June 2003, be assigned to sections of the\r\nTrial Chambers composed of both permanent and ad\r\nlitem judges. They will work in shifts. The precise\r\nmanner in which the shift schedule will operate will\r\ndepend on the progress of the respective trials and the\r\navailability of parties. Currently, the Trial Chambers\r\nhold morning sessions from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and\r\nafternoon sessions from 2.30 p.m. or 3 p.m. to 5.30\r\np.m. to 6 p.m. When the ad litem judges join us, we\r\nwill work in two shifts, with some Trial Chamber\r\nsections sitting from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and the other\r\nsections sitting from 1.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., thus\r\ndispensing with the need to build additional\r\ncourtrooms.\r\nIn the month of October, Trial Chamber I has\r\nconducted two trials in a shift system. The media trial\r\nwas conducted from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and the\r\nNiyitegeka trial from 2 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Sitting on\r\nboth trials, the Vice-President and I were consequently\r\nin court for 10 hours each day. Nevertheless, this\r\nschedule served as a trial run for the ad litem shift\r\nsystem, which will have two shifts with different\r\njudges. I therefore envisage no difficulties over the\r\nintegration of the ad litem judges.\r\nMy original proposal to the Security Council,\r\nhowever, was for nine ad litem judges to take office at\r\nany one time, which is the number of ad litem judges\r\nthat was granted to the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). I also requested\r\nflexibility to form trial chamber sections comprising ad\r\nlitem judges alone. These proposals were made to\r\nenable us to complete the ICTR mandate by the years\r\n2007 and 2008. It is of utmost importance that, when\r\nthe matter is again reviewed, the additional ad litem\r\njudges we requested be authorized if the projected date\r\nof the years 2007-2008 for the completion of the ICTR\r\nmandate is to be maintained.\r\nWith regard to the Registry, the Registrar took\r\noffice in March 2001 and the Deputy Registrar was\r\nappointed in October 2001. The appointment of the\r\nDeputy Registrar, who has the responsibility for the\r\nRegistrys Judicial and Legal Services Division, has\r\nstrengthened the Registrars capacity to provide\r\njudicial and administrative support to the Chambers,\r\nthe Prosecution and the Defence. Regular meetings are\r\nheld between the President, the Registrar and the\r\nProsecutor to coordinate management of the Tribunal. I\r\nnote, however, that the Office of the Deputy Prosecutor\r\nhas remained vacant for more than one year.\r\nWith regard to the arrests of suspects, 18 accused\r\nare still at large and warrants have been issued for their\r\narrest. The cooperation of Member States is sought to\r\nsecure their arrest and transfer. For this year, six\r\npersons have been arrested, with the most recent arrest\r\nbeing that of Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho. Renzaho was\r\narrested on 29 September 2002 in Kinshasa, in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. This was the first\r\narrest of an ICTR suspect by the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo and is the third since the announcement\r\nof the United States reward for justice campaign,\r\nwhich identified nine high-profile suspects.\r\nWith regard to the enforcement of sentences, the\r\nFrench and Italian Governments are due to sign\r\nagreements shortly with the ICTR to enforce sentences\r\nof ICTR convicts. Other countries that have concluded\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nsimilar agreements are the Republic of Mali, the\r\nRepublic of Benin and the Kingdom of Swaziland. On\r\n23 November 2001 and 3 December 2001, I designated\r\nthe Republic of Mali for the purposes of enforcing the\r\nsentences of six convicted prisoners, including the\r\nformer Prime Minister of Rwanda, Jean Kambanda,\r\nwho is presently serving a sentence of life\r\nimprisonment. I wish to thank those Governments for\r\ntheir support in respect of the enforcement of\r\nsentences.\r\nDuring the period under review, the Appeals\r\nChamber delivered one appeal judgment on the merits,\r\n10 interlocutory appeal decisions and 25 other\r\ndecisions and orders. In two appeals on the merits,\r\nhearings were held from 2 to 5 July in Arusha and the\r\nAppeals Chamber is now deliberating over judgment.\r\nThe current mandate of the judges expires on 23\r\nMay 2003 and elections are expected to take place\r\nearly next year. I will conclude this, my final\r\nappearance before this body, with the following\r\ncomments.\r\nI wish to place on record the commitment and\r\nindustry of the staff at the ICTR. They have worked\r\nunstintingly in a duty station classified as\r\nhardship C  not without accidents, illness and even\r\ndeaths  to ensure the successful functioning of the\r\nICTR.\r\nWhen setting up the ICTR, the Security Council\r\nwas convinced that the Tribunal would contribute to\r\nthe process of national reconciliation and the\r\nrestoration and maintenance of peace. Much that the\r\nICTR does will, in due course, contribute to that long-\r\nterm end. However, compensation for victims is\r\nessential if Rwanda is to recover from the genocidal\r\nexperience.\r\nOn 9 November 2000, I submitted a proposal to\r\nthe Secretary-General that victims of genocide should\r\nbe compensated. My proposal referred to the\r\nDeclaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims\r\nof Crime and Abuse of Power, which was adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly in 1985. This Declaration\r\nreminds the world that victims of crime should be\r\ntreated with compassion and respect, and states that\r\nthey are entitled to receive justice, should be treated\r\nfairly and obtain redress in the form of restitution,\r\ncompensation and other assistance for the injuries they\r\nhave suffered.\r\nMany Rwandans have questioned the ICTRs\r\nvalue and its role in promoting reconciliation where\r\nclaim for compensation is not addressed. For every\r\nhour of every day for the past seven and-a-half years,\r\nwe have lived with the voices of the survivors of\r\ngenocide; and, so, we strongly urge the United Nations\r\nto provide compensation for Rwandas victims.\r\nIt would be true to say that the last 10 years have\r\nseen more rapid growth in the international rule of law\r\nthan in any time since the inception and planning of the\r\nNuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals. The ICTR and the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former\r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) have contributed significantly to\r\ninternational criminal justice. The world has forever\r\nbeen altered by the establishment of the ICTR, ICTY\r\nand the International Criminal Court (ICC). Together,\r\nthese institutions have made it possible to contemplate\r\na time when political leaders can no longer act with\r\nimpunity, depriving groups of their own citizens of the\r\nright to life, the right to be free from physical harm or\r\nsexual violence or political or religious persecution.\r\nAs I come to the end of my eight years of service,\r\nlooking back to my first days when there were no\r\npremises, virtually no staff and little more than an idea\r\nand a Statute, I recall confirming the first indictment of\r\nthe ICTR out of a hotel room in Arusha. While\r\nprogress may seem slow, it has been steady and strong.\r\nWe are engaged in a new undertaking without\r\nprecedent, and there have been many peaks and\r\nvalleys. Over time, though, we have grown from the\r\nweeping mille collines, or a thousand hills, of\r\nRwanda, to the heights of Mount Kilimanjaro, and our\r\njudgments will occupy a place in history.\r\nAllow me, Sir, through you, to take this\r\nopportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the\r\nPresident and Members of the General Assembly for\r\ntheir support, and hope that support for the work of the\r\nICTR will continue. I also wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\nassistance.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of\r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and\r\nwish her well in her future endeavours.\r\nMs. Dissing (Denmark): I am honoured to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union (EU). The countries\r\nof Central and Eastern Europe associated with the\r\nEuropean Union  Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nand Slovenia  and the associated countries of\r\nCyprus, Malta, Turkey, as well as the EFTA (European\r\nFree Trade Association) countries of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Iceland and Liechtenstein, align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union would like to once again\r\nexpress its strong support for the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The Tribunal has\r\ncontinued its work to ensure that crimes against\r\ninternational humanitarian law, and in particular the\r\ncrime of genocide, will not go unpunished. Together\r\nwith the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY),\r\nthe Tribunal for Rwanda serves as an example of the\r\ndetermination of the international community to\r\ncombat impunity. Under no circumstances shall\r\nperpetrators of serious violations of international\r\nhumanitarian law enjoy impunity, no matter their rank,\r\nposition or citizenship.\r\nThe impact of the Tribunals will go far beyond\r\nthe cases under their jurisdiction. Their pioneering\r\nwork, not least in prosecuting individuals for the crime\r\nof genocide, and the decision that crimes of sexual\r\nviolence are war crimes within their jurisdiction, has\r\npaved the way for the International Criminal Court\r\n(ICC), the first permanent international structure to\r\ncombat impunity for the most serious crimes that are of\r\nconcern to the international community as a whole.\r\nThe European Union thanks the President of the\r\nTribunal for her annual report. The report illustrates the\r\nprogress made and draws to our attention ways and\r\nmeans to further improve the work of the Tribunal. The\r\nfact that no first instance judgments have been\r\nrendered since we last discussed this agenda item in the\r\nGeneral Assembly is a painful reminder of the\r\nnecessity of these improvements.\r\nThe European Union notes with interest the\r\nintroduction of a multiple trials system, by which each\r\nTrial Chamber conducts three trials at the same time in\r\nphases of two to six weeks per trial. This system is\r\nonly one of a number of initiatives taken on first\r\ninstance and appeals level in order to speed up and\r\nimprove the work of the Tribunal. We support the\r\nChambers in their continued dedicated work in this\r\nrespect.\r\nThe adoption by the Security Council of\r\nresolution 1431 (2002) two months ago is yet another\r\nstep on the path towards a more efficient Tribunal. The\r\nresolution enables the creation of a pool of 18 ad litem\r\njudges and will significantly enhance the Tribunals\r\ncapacity to decide within reasonable time on the cases\r\nbefore it. The European Union is, however, deeply\r\nconcerned that the Security Council has found it\r\nnecessary to extend the deadline for nominations for\r\nreplacement or re-election of the Tribunals full-time\r\njudges by an additional two months in an attempt to\r\nreach the minimum requirement of 22 nominations. We\r\nurge all Member States to consider nominating\r\nqualified candidates in order to reach the mandated\r\nminimum.\r\nAs regards the Office of the Prosecutor, the\r\nEuropean Union notes with interest the revised\r\ninvestigation programme by which the estimated\r\nnumber of new investigations has been reduced\r\ndramatically from 136 to 16 individuals. This reduction\r\nbrings the number of outstanding indictments to 26,\r\nwhich the Prosecutor intends to submit for\r\nconfirmation by 2004. A further 40 cases are envisaged\r\nas being transferred to other jurisdictions. We\r\nappreciate that this represents a more realistic\r\nprogramme, enabling the Tribunal to complete its first\r\ninstance trials by 2008.\r\nSince assuming office in March 2001, the\r\nRegistrar has given priority to a reform of the legal aid\r\nprogramme and taken much-desired steps to avert\r\nabuses of the system, most notably fee-splitting\r\nbetween the defence counsel and the accused.\r\nHowever, the European Union remains concerned at\r\nthe absence of checks on the size of defence teams and\r\nof the extravagant fees paid, highlighted in the recent\r\nAuditors report. The European Union commends the\r\nRegistrar for improved disciplines introduced to date\r\nand urges him to continue in this spirit.\r\nThe cooperation of States with the Tribunal has\r\ngenerally been good. The European Union encourages\r\nall States concerned to continue along these lines. The\r\nrecent divergences between the Tribunal and the\r\nRwandan Government are a source of deep concern.\r\nWe strongly urge the Rwandan Government to comply\r\nfully with its international obligations to cooperate\r\nwith the Tribunal and to deliver all information asked\r\nby it, regardless of the persons or institutions\r\nconcerned.\r\nSince its establishment, the Tribunal has\r\nencountered significant difficulties. The European\r\nUnion has voiced its concern on many occasions in that\r\nregard. We are pleased to see the Tribunal showing\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nsigns of improvement. It is our sincere hope that the\r\nvarious measures taken will enhance its work so that\r\nsubstantial progress will be seen in the next annual\r\nreport. We thank all the members of the Tribunal for\r\nresolutely pursuing that objective. Their action to\r\nfurther the causes of justice, peace and national\r\nreconciliation is essential. We wish to conclude this\r\nstatement by ensuring them of the European Unions\r\nwholehearted support.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): Let me begin by expressing\r\nour full recognition of the achievements and the high\r\nstandards of the International Criminal Tribunal for\r\nRwanda (ICTR), as reflected both in various\r\njudgements and in the report before us (A/57/163). We\r\nwould like to thank the President of the Tribunal for\r\nthe detailed annual report which, in our view,\r\naccurately reflects the progress made during the period\r\nunder review.\r\nThe measures implemented by the Tribunal to\r\nbetter streamline the conduct of business so that\r\ncapacity is utilized to a maximum have yielded\r\ntangible results. We recognize the Tribunals persistent\r\nefforts to identify areas for improvement, in particular\r\nmeasures to enhance efficiency and judicial economy,\r\nand to take necessary steps.\r\nThe judgements of the Tribunal constitute\r\nessential contributions to international jurisprudence\r\nwith regard to the prosecution of the most serious\r\ninternational crimes. The continuing work of the Ad\r\nHoc Tribunals and their activities also pave the way for\r\nthe future work of the newly established International\r\nCriminal Court.\r\nThe success of the Tribunal will to a large degree\r\nbe judged by the manner in which the investigation,\r\nprosecution and proceedings are managed. It is\r\nimperative that the Tribunal carries out those tasks in\r\nan efficient manner so that detainees are not subject to\r\nundue delays in the completion of their trials.\r\nWe, therefore, regret that certain proceedings\r\ncontinue to be long drawn out. At the same time, we\r\nare aware of the immense resources required to try the\r\nmost serious international crimes. The number of\r\nwitnesses, the demanding nature and complexity of\r\ncases, the frequency of various kinds of appeals on\r\nissues of law and the need for interpretation into three\r\nlanguages, together with cultural and linguistic\r\nnuances, all contribute to explaining why the turnover\r\nof cases is not comparable to that in our national\r\nsystems when dealing with ordinary crimes. We have\r\nfollowed with close attention the efforts of ICTR\r\njudges to progressively improve trial procedures in\r\norder to speed up cases. We are confident that such\r\nstreamlining of internal court management procedures\r\nhas in no way jeopardized the right of the parties to a\r\nfair trial.\r\nBearing in mind the need to prepare for the\r\nforeseeable rise in the number of cases on appeal, we\r\nespecially welcome the arrival of two additional judges\r\nin the Appeals Chamber, as well as efforts to\r\nstrengthen the structural links between the Appeals\r\nChambers of the ICTR and the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The establishment\r\nof a system for the more frequent dissemination of\r\ninformation and the setting up of a common database\r\nwill be important contributions to make the case law of\r\nthe Appeals Chambers consistent and simplify the\r\nwork of the judges and staff in Chambers.\r\nAs we are committed to the timely fulfilment of\r\nthe mandate entrusted to the ICTR, we welcome the\r\nProsecutors revision of her future investigation\r\nprogramme. The reduction in the estimated number of\r\nnew indictments, combined with the identification of\r\n40 suspects whose prosecution is intended for deferral\r\nto national jurisdictions, makes completion of the\r\nTribunals mandate possible by the years 2007-2008.\r\nHowever, the timely completion of the mandate is\r\nalso dependent on added resources. We are, therefore,\r\nvery pleased that the Security Council reached\r\nagreement on resolution 1431 on 14 August 2002, with\r\na view to creating a pool of 18 ad litem judges, which\r\nwill hopefully significantly enhance the capacity of the\r\nTribunal to dispose of the cases pending before it. We\r\nlook foreword to a swift implementation of the\r\nresolution.\r\nCertain financial and management issues, mainly\r\nrelated to defence counsel and legal aid, are still a\r\ncause for concern to us. We note, however, the\r\nTribunals efforts to deal with those problems, and\r\nwelcome in this regard the new provision in the code of\r\nprofessional conduct for defence counsel that explicitly\r\nprohibits fee-splitting. According to that provision,\r\nwhen a counsel is found to have engaged in fee-\r\nsplitting, the Registrar will take action in accordance\r\nwith the Tribunals Directive on Assignment of\r\nDefence Counsel.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the establishment of a\r\npanel to improve the legal aid programme in order to\r\nensure the efficient use of resources and the protection\r\nof the integrity of the Tribunals judicial process. We\r\ntrust that the Board of Auditors recommendations for\r\nimproving the legal aid system will be thoroughly\r\nconsidered in that connection. Those recommendations\r\ninclude measures for establishing clear and quantitative\r\ncriteria to determine whether a person qualifies for\r\nlegal aid, as well as reliable working relationships, to\r\nensure that Member States provide the assistance\r\nneeded to verify the financial position of the accused.\r\nIt is critical to the success of the Tribunal that the\r\npeople of the region are informed about its work and\r\nunderstand its significance. In that respect, the\r\nproactive profile of the Outreach Programme is an\r\nessential complement to the main public information\r\nactivities of the Tribunal. During the period under\r\nreview, Norway has donated almost 100,000 Euros to a\r\nproject for training African journalists from the Great\r\nLakes region in legal reporting. We encourage all\r\nStates to actively support the continued work of\r\nbringing the judicial process closer to the public in\r\norder to promote greater insight and feedback, which\r\nmay be an essential factor in achieving long-term peace\r\nand reconciliation in the area.\r\nWe further appeal to all States to demonstrate, not\r\nonly in words but also in practice, their fullest\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal. Facilitating access of\r\nwitnesses to the Tribunal is paramount. Moreover,\r\nStates that have not yet done so should take all the\r\nlegislative steps necessary to ensure effective State\r\ncooperation with the Tribunal. We note that the\r\nTribunal has received valuable assistance from several\r\nStates, enabling the arrest of several indictees. In\r\naddition to legislation and compliance with the\r\nTribunals requests for assistance, concrete support to\r\nthe Tribunal should be shown through financial and\r\nmaterial contributions. The Tribunal must be provided\r\nwith the necessary resources to carry out investigations\r\nand prosecution in a proper and expedient manner and\r\nto increase its activity. The Tribunal deserves political,\r\npractical and financial support. Normative structures\r\nalone are far from sufficient.\r\nAs we are convinced of the need to ensure that no\r\none gambles on impunity for acts of genocide, other\r\ncrimes against humanity or serious war crimes, the\r\nAssembly may rest assured that we will stand by our\r\nlong-term commitment to the successful fulfilment of\r\nthe ICTR.\r\nMr. Ng Lip Yong (Malaysia): I would like to\r\nthank Judge Navanethem Pillay, President of the\r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR),\r\nfor her lucid presentation of the seventh annual report\r\nof the Tribunal, contained in document A/57/163 -\r\nS/2002/733. The report provides a comprehensive\r\noverview of the progress of the work of the Tribunal as\r\nwell as the difficulties encountered by it. We commend\r\nthe President and her fellow judges as well as the\r\nProsecutor and her team for the progress achieved thus\r\nfar.\r\nMalaysia continues to believe strongly in the\r\nimportance of upholding the principles of justice and\r\nequality which international humanitarian law stands\r\nfor. We regard adherence to the rule of law as a\r\nnecessary basis in upholding these principles. The\r\nTribunal plays a significant role in clearly\r\ndemonstrating that genocide and other serious\r\nviolations of international humanitarian law cannot be\r\ntolerated. The Tribunal is there to ensure that the\r\nperpetrators of genocide and other serious violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law will not get away with\r\nimpunity.\r\nMy delegation deems that the work of the\r\nTribunal is of immense importance in bringing to\r\njustice perpetrators of atrocities and in the development\r\nof international justice and international humanitarian\r\nlaw. There is no doubt that the decisions of the\r\nTribunal, as well as that of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), have\r\ncontributed to the progressive and constructive\r\ndevelopment of case law in the spheres of general\r\ninternational law and international humanitarian law, in\r\nrespect of different questions of procedure and\r\ncompetence and also on substantive issues of\r\nconsiderable importance. The experience of both\r\nTribunals would undoubtedly be helpful to assist the\r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) and the Special\r\nCourt for Sierra Leone (SCSL) in their work.\r\nFurther, my delegation notes that the Tribunal has\r\nled to pioneering advocacy methods for victim oriented\r\nrestitutive justice in international criminal law  a\r\nconcept which has been included in the Rome Statute.\r\nAs reflected in the report, this involves providing legal\r\nguidance, psychological counselling and medical\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nassistance to victims and witnesses. We warmly\r\nwelcome this move.\r\nWe are pleased to note from the report that the\r\nTribunal has undertaken further measures to improve\r\nits performance in expediting proceedings towards the\r\ncompletion of its mandate within a reasonable time. We\r\nbelieve that such measures, including practices to\r\nensure the exercise of greater judicial control over\r\nproceedings and to streamline them, assigning motions\r\nto respective judges rather than a full Chamber,\r\nconsideration of motions on brief, and resort to oral\r\nrulings instead of written decisions, are practical. We\r\nrecognize that in resorting to such measures, the\r\nTribunal is mindful of the need to ensure that the\r\nconduct of fair trial is not compromised.\r\nWe are pleased to learn from the report that a\r\nnumber of proposals for amendments to the rules of the\r\nTribunal, including for fair trial and expediting trials\r\nand appeals, are under consideration. We would\r\nencourage the Tribunal, which is constantly striving to\r\nimprove its working methods, to continue deliberations\r\non such proposals. We note the Presidents remarks\r\nregarding lengthy trials and the reasons for them. We\r\nthink that many lessons can be drawn from the\r\nTribunals experience in this particular instance, in\r\norder to improve the Tribunals future work as well as\r\nthe work of other similar tribunals.\r\nDuring the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, my delegation supported the proposal to\r\ncreate a pool of ad litem judges to serve in the Tribunal\r\nin order to enhance its judicial productivity. We\r\nbelieved this was necessary, considering the workload\r\nof the Tribunal and the need for cases to be\r\nexpeditiously dealt with. In this regard, we are satisfied\r\nthat the Security Council on 14 August 2002\r\nunanimously adopted resolution 1431 to establish a\r\npool of 18 ad litem judges. Their appointment would\r\ndefinitely assist in expediting cases that the Trial\r\nChambers are currently unable to undertake,\r\nparticularly the seven cases ready for trial and the cases\r\nof the remaining 16 detainees awaiting trial. We look\r\nforward to the election of the ad litem judges to enable\r\nthe Tribunal to conclude its mandate.\r\nMy delegation shares the Presidents concern that\r\nthe post of the Deputy Prosecutor has been vacant for\r\nover a year. We think that the absence of such an\r\nimportant official to assume responsibility of the\r\nactivities of the Office of the Prosecutor in Kigali is\r\nlikely to adversely affect the quality and pace of\r\ninvestigations and the Prosecutors preparation of\r\ntrials. We hope that efforts would be intensified to find\r\na suitable candidate to fill this vacancy as soon as\r\npossible.\r\nWe note that the Prosecutor has revised her\r\nstrategy for conducting investigations and preparations\r\nof trials and will now only conduct investigations\r\nagainst 14 new individuals, together with 10 ongoing\r\ninvestigations. We also note that she has identified 40\r\nsuspects whose prosecutions she intends to defer to\r\ncompetent national jurisdictions and is seeking the\r\nintroduction of a new rule 11 bis, to facilitate deferral\r\nof cases to Rwanda where indictments have already\r\nbeen confirmed, provided the death penalty is not\r\nimposed. While we understand the need for such\r\nmeasures, we hope that this arrangement would not\r\nprejudice the right of the victim to justice and the right\r\nof the accused to a fair trial.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the Registrar of the\r\nTribunal in improving the visibility of the Tribunal and\r\nsupport for its work, particularly his efforts at\r\nestablishing and strengthening institutional cooperation\r\nbetween the Tribunal and African States. We are\r\npleased to note that the Outreach Programme of the\r\nICTR remains popular and important to the national\r\nreconciliation of Rwanda. We welcome the publication\r\nof the Daily Journal which increases public\r\nunderstanding of the work of the Tribunal.\r\nWe support the measures taken by the Tribunal to\r\ndeal with the abuse of the legal aid system. The\r\nestablishment of a panel to improve the legal aid\r\nprogramme, ensure the efficient use of resources and\r\nprotect the integrity of the Tribunals judicial process,\r\nis most appropriate.\r\nTowards improving the efficient use of the\r\nTribunals time, my delegation welcomes the use of\r\nsimultaneous interpretation during proceedings and the\r\nemployment of a video-satellite link to take the\r\ntestimony of witnesses unable to travel to Arusha. We\r\nnote the problems faced in ensuring the availability of\r\nwitnesses. We hope that all States concerned with\r\nfacilitating their travel for trials would continue to\r\nassist the Tribunal in this respect.\r\nMalaysia continues to support the role of the\r\nTribunal not only in upholding justice, and but also as a\r\ntool to facilitate national reconciliation in Rwanda. We\r\nhope it will continue to have the strong and sustained\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.36\r\nsupport of the international community until the\r\ncompletion of its work.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on Agenda item 46. The General Assembly\r\n has thus concluded this stage of its consideration of\r\nAgenda item 46.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.10 p.m.\r\n"
