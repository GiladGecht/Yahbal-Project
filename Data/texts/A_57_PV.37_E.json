(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 13\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\n(A/57/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/373)\r\nThe President: May I take it that the General\r\nAssembly takes note of the report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice for the period 1 August 2001 to 31\r\nJuly 2002?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In connection with this item the\r\nAssembly also has before it the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/57/373) on the Secretary-General’s Trust\r\nFund to Assist States in the Settlement of Disputes\r\nthrough the International Court of Justice.\r\nI now call on Mr. Gilbert Guillaume, President of\r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Guillaume (spoke in French): It is an honour\r\nfor me once again to address the General Assembly on\r\nthe occasion of its examination of the latest report of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, for the period\r\n1 August 2001 to 31 July 2002 (A/57/4).\r\nIt is a particular pleasure to address the Assembly\r\ntoday under the presidency of Mr. Jan Kavan, former\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Czech Republic. I congratulate you, Sir,\r\non your well-merited election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the Assembly and wish you\r\nevery success in the high office with which he has been\r\nentrusted.\r\nEvery year for close to a decade the Assembly\r\nhas accorded the President of the Court the opportunity\r\nto address it, thereby demonstrating its particular\r\nattachment to the Court, the Organization’s principal\r\njudicial organ, an honour for which we are most\r\ngrateful. The Court has made its usual annual report to\r\nthe Assembly, accompanied by a summary, from which\r\nit can be seen that our docket remains extremely full\r\nand our activity sustained. Addressing the Assembly a\r\nyear ago, I reported a total of 22 cases entered on our\r\nlist; today the figure now is 24.\r\nThose cases come from every continent and touch\r\non an extremely wide range of issues. A classic type of\r\ndispute involves proceedings between States\r\nconcerning the treatment of foreign nationals and\r\nproperty. We have two examples of this kind, one\r\nbetween Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the other between Liechtenstein and Germany.\r\nAnother source of much litigation is territorial\r\nand boundary disputes, both land and maritime. We\r\ncurrently have four such disputes before us: between\r\nIndonesia and Malaysia; Nicaragua and Honduras;\r\nNicaragua and Colombia; and Benin and Niger. The\r\nlast two of these cases are new ones, and I should, in\r\npassing, like to take this opportunity to congratulate\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nBenin and Niger on their decision, taken by joint\r\nagreement, to submit their frontier dispute to a\r\nchamber of the Court.\r\nOther cases are linked more directly to events\r\nconcerning the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity which this Assembly or the Security Council\r\nhas had to address, including the destruction of Iranian\r\noil platforms in 1987 and 1988; the consequences of\r\nthe explosion of a United States civil aircraft over\r\nLockerbie in Scotland; the crises in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and in Kosovo; and the situation in the\r\nGreat Lakes region of Africa, which has recently been\r\nthe subject of new proceedings brought by the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo against Rwanda.\r\nThus, since August 2001 the Court has once again\r\nwitnessed an increase in the number of cases on its list,\r\ndespite its intense and sustained judicial activity\r\nthroughout the past year. In all, while receiving three\r\nnew cases during this period, the Court has given final\r\ndecisions on the merits in two difficult cases, as well as\r\nruling on an application for permission to intervene and\r\non the admissibility of various counter-claims. It has\r\nalso dealt with a request for the indication of\r\nprovisional measures. These have been important\r\ndecisions, about which I should like to say a few\r\nwords.\r\nI would first remind the Assembly of the\r\nJudgment handed down by the Court on 23 October\r\n2001 in proceedings between Indonesia and Malaysia\r\nregarding sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau\r\nSipadan. The Philippines had sought to intervene in\r\nthis case, while at the same time making it clear that it\r\nhad no claim over the islands in question. Giving a\r\nbroad interpretation to Article 62 of its Statute, the\r\nCourt accepted that a State may intervene not only\r\nwhen the operative part of a judgment is capable of\r\naffecting its legal interests, but also where those\r\ninterests relate to the reasoning constituting the\r\nnecessary underpinning of that operative decision. The\r\nCourt held, however, that in the particular case the\r\nPhilippines had not established that it had such an\r\ninterest and that its request to intervene could not\r\ntherefore be accepted, though the proceedings have\r\nenabled the Court to become cognizant of the\r\nPhilippine position.\r\nThe judicial year just ended was marked by a\r\nsecond Judgment, rendered on 14 February 2002,\r\nsettling a dispute between the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and Belgium concerning an international\r\narrest warrant issued on 11 April 2000 by the Belgian\r\njudicial authorities against Mr. Abdulaye Yerodia\r\nNdombasi, who was at the time the Congo’s Foreign\r\nMinister. In that Judgment the Court held that the issue\r\nof the warrant and its international circulation had\r\nconstituted a violation by Belgium of the immunity\r\nfrom criminal jurisdiction and the inviolability enjoyed\r\nby Foreign Ministers under customary international\r\nlaw.\r\nThe Judgment thereby settled an important issue\r\nof current interest, one which international judges were\r\naddressing for the first time: the question of the\r\nimmunity from jurisdiction of Ministers for Foreign\r\nAffairs. In that regard the Court held that\r\n“the functions of a Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nare such that, throughout the duration of his or\r\nher office, he or she when abroad enjoys full\r\nimmunity from criminal jurisdiction and\r\ninviolability. That immunity and that inviolability\r\nprotect the individual concerned against any act\r\nof authority of another State which would hinder\r\nhim or her in the performance of his or her\r\nduties” (International Court of Justice Judgment\r\nof 14 February 2002, para. 54),\r\nirrespective of the offence with which such individual\r\nis charged.\r\nThe Court made it clear, however, that immunity\r\ndoes not signify impunity: a Minister in office can, of\r\ncourse, be tried before the criminal courts of his own\r\ncountry, in accordance with the law of that country.\r\nFurthermore, his immunity may in a particular case be\r\nwaived by his national authorities in favour of a\r\nforeign jurisdiction. Immunity may also be lifted in the\r\ncase of proceedings before international courts or\r\ntribunals if their founding statutes so provide. Finally,\r\nwhere a person ceases to hold the office of Foreign\r\nMinister, he or she will lose all immunity before\r\ncompetent foreign courts in respect of acts committed\r\nprior or subsequent to his or her period of office, as\r\nwell as in respect of acts committed during that period\r\nof office in a private capacity.\r\nIn the domain of international peace and security,\r\nthe Court also handed down a number of decisions in\r\nthe course of the year 2001 concerning the African\r\nGreat Lakes region.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nFirst came an Order issued on 20 November 2001\r\nin the dispute between the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Uganda. The respondent State had\r\nsubmitted counter-claims, and the Court had to decide\r\non the admissibility of those claims. It held admissible\r\nthose claims which were directly connected with the\r\nprincipal claim and dismissed the others.\r\nSubsequently, the Court had to address a request\r\nfor the indication of provisional measures by the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo against Rwanda. By\r\nOrder of 10 July 2002 the Court rejected the request on\r\ngrounds of lack of prima facie jurisdiction. At the same\r\ntime it dismissed Rwanda’s submissions seeking to\r\nhave the case removed from the list on grounds of\r\nmanifest lack of jurisdiction.\r\nThe Court took the opportunity to remind the\r\nparties that there is a fundamental distinction between\r\nthe question of acceptance by a State of the Court’s\r\njurisdiction and that of the compatibility of certain acts\r\nwith international law. Whether or not States accept the\r\njurisdiction of the Court, they are bound to comply\r\nwith the United Nations Charter and remain\r\nresponsible for acts attributable to them which are in\r\nbreach of international law.\r\nThese two cases are continuing.\r\nThe Court’s most recent Judgment was in the case\r\nof the Land and Maritime Boundary between\r\nCameroon and Nigeria.\r\nIn 1994 Cameroon seized the Court of a legal\r\ndispute with Nigeria in regard to sovereignty over the\r\nBakassi Peninsula. Cameroon subsequently widened\r\nthe scope of its Application, requesting the Court to\r\ndetermine the land boundary between the two States\r\nfrom Lake Chad to the sea and to delimit their\r\nrespective maritime areas. It also claimed reparation\r\nfrom Nigeria on account of damage suffered as a result\r\nof the occupation of Bakassi and Lake Chad, as well as\r\nof various frontier incidents. Nigeria responded by\r\nraising eight preliminary objections on grounds of lack\r\nof jurisdiction and inadmissibility, which were\r\naddressed by the Court in a judgment of 11 June 1998.\r\nNigeria went on to submit a request for interpretation\r\nof this initial judgment, on which the Court ruled on 25\r\nMarch 1999. Nigeria then submitted counter-claims\r\nand Equatorial Guinea an application for permission to\r\nintervene, whose admissibility we had to address.\r\nThe written pleadings exceeded 6,000 pages; the\r\nhearings lasted five weeks and the deliberations seven\r\nmonths. On 10 October 2002 the Court handed down\r\nits judgment, which runs to over 150 pages.\r\nThe Court held that the boundary between\r\nCameroon and Nigeria had been fixed by treaties\r\nconcluded during the colonial period, whose validity it\r\nconfirmed. In consequence, the Court decided, by 13\r\nvotes to 3, that, pursuant to the Anglo-German\r\nAgreement of 11 March 1913, sovereignty over\r\nBakassi lay with Cameroon. Likewise, the Court\r\ndetermined, by 14 votes to 2, the boundary in the Lake\r\nChad area in accordance with a Franco-British\r\nExchange of Notes of 9 January 1931 and rejected\r\nNigeria’s claims in that area. The Court also\r\nunanimously defined with extreme precision the course\r\nof the land boundary between the two States in 17\r\nother disputed sectors.\r\nThe Court then went on to determine the maritime\r\nboundary between the two States. It began by\r\nconfirming the validity of the Yaoundé II and Maroua\r\nDeclarations, whereby the heads of State of Cameroon\r\nand Nigeria had, in 1971 and 1975, agreed on the\r\nmaritime boundary separating the territorial seas of the\r\ntwo States. Then, in regard to the maritime boundaries\r\nfurther out to sea, the Court adopted as the delimitation\r\nline the equidistance line between Cameroon and\r\nNigeria, which appeared to it in this case to produce\r\nequitable results as between the two States.\r\nDrawing upon the consequences of its\r\ndetermination of the land boundary, the Court held that\r\neach of the two States is under an obligation\r\nexpeditiously and without condition to withdraw its\r\nadministration and military and police forces from\r\nareas falling within the sovereignty of the other.\r\nIn the reasoning of its judgment, the Court also\r\nnoted that the implementation of the judgment would\r\nprovide the parties with a beneficial opportunity for\r\ncooperation. It took note of Cameroon’s undertaking at\r\nthe hearings that, “faithful to its traditional policy of\r\nhospitality and tolerance”, it “will continue to afford\r\nprotection to Nigerians living in the Bakassi Peninsula\r\nand in the Lake Chad area”.\r\nFinally, the Court rejected each party’s State\r\nresponsibility claims against the other.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nThis Judgment is final. It is binding on the parties\r\nand thus brings legal closure to the frontier dispute\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\nHaving thus analysed the most important of the\r\nCourt’s decisions in the course of the past year, I will\r\nnot now burden the Assembly with details of the other\r\ndecisions — and in particular the other 15 orders, of\r\nextremely varied content — which we have rendered.\r\nI would simply add that we are planning, in the\r\nnext few weeks, to hand down our judgment on the\r\nmerits in the case concerning sovereignty over Pulau\r\nLigitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia). At the\r\nbeginning of next month, we shall be holding hearings\r\non the request submitted by the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia for revision of the Court’s judgment of 11\r\nJuly 1996, in which we had found that we had\r\njurisdiction to hear the application by Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina based on the Convention on the\r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\r\nWe hope to decide this case also before 6 February\r\n2003, when the new composition of the Court will take\r\neffect, pursuant to the vote on 21 October last.\r\nDespite these efforts, the Court’s docket remains\r\nover-burdened. Several cases will become ready for\r\nhearing in 2003, and we will have to continue our\r\nsearch for ways to avoid excessive delays in the\r\nconsideration of those cases.\r\nIn recent years the Court has carried out a number\r\nof reviews of its procedures with a view to expediting\r\nthe treatment of cases, and I believe that it would be\r\nhelpful to summarize the current situation in this\r\nregard.\r\nFirst, the Court has sought to reduce the length of\r\nwritten and oral proceedings. To this end, it has\r\namended articles 79 and 80 of the Rules in order to\r\nspeed up consideration of preliminary objections and to\r\nclarify the conditions for dealing with counter-claims.\r\nThe Court has decided to apply more strictly article 45\r\nof the Rules, whereby a single exchange of written\r\nproceedings must be regarded as the norm in cases\r\ninitiated by application. Finally, it considers it\r\nnecessary to limit the length of oral presentations in\r\naccordance with article 60 of the Rules, in particular\r\nwith regard to the second round of pleadings.\r\nThe Court has also circulated to parties a certain\r\nnumber of Practice Directions, again aimed at reducing\r\nthe quantity and length of written pleadings and the\r\nduration of hearings. It, therefore, now asks parties that\r\nsubmit a case by special agreement to avoid the\r\nsimultaneous filing of pleadings, which often unduly\r\nprolongs the proceedings and results in unnecessary\r\nproliferation of documents. It asks them to be\r\nrigorously selective in the documents that they append\r\nto their pleadings and to provide the Court with any\r\navailable translations of pleadings and annexes. The\r\nCourt further considers that, where preliminary\r\nobjections have been raised by a party under article 79\r\nof the Rules, the other party should generally be able to\r\nfile its observations on those objections within a\r\nmaximum period of four months. Finally, the Court\r\nasks the parties, save in exceptional cases, to refrain\r\nfrom presenting new documents after the close of\r\nwritten proceedings.\r\nThe Court has also decided, by way of\r\nexperiment, to simplify its own deliberations. It has\r\ndecided that when it has to address two cases, both of\r\nwhich raise questions of jurisdiction or admissibility, it\r\nwill be able to hear them in immediate succession and\r\nthen to consider them concurrently. It has reviewed its\r\nprior practice whereby, at the close of oral proceedings,\r\neach judge prepares a written note on the case, which is\r\nthen circulated to the other members of the Court.\r\nHenceforth, in incidental proceedings or straightforward\r\ncases, the Court will deliberate without written notes. It\r\nhas also agreed that in other cases notes will be as\r\nconcise as possible.\r\nIf these new procedural measures are to yield\r\nresults, the price to be paid is harder work for both the\r\njudges and the Registry. That is what we have been\r\ndoing and will continue to do. This year, for example,\r\nthe Court decided to continue working until the end of\r\nJuly, to confine its judicial vacation to the month of\r\nAugust and to begin its deliberations again on 3\r\nSeptember.\r\nThe increase in the work rate was based on the\r\nassumption that the Court and its Registry would be\r\naccorded additional resources. In this regard I would\r\nlike to thank the Assembly for responding to my urgent\r\nappeal from this very rostrum last year. The Court’s\r\nbudget for the biennium 2002-2003 was increased to\r\n$11.436 million per year. That increase was not as\r\ngreat as might have been hoped, as a result in particular\r\nof the across-the-board cuts in funding for all\r\nprogrammes imposed on all United Nations bodies. It\r\nhas, however, enabled us to increase our staff to 91 —\r\n77 posts being permanent — and to recruit additional\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\ntranslators, lawyers and administrative staff. At the\r\nsame time, the Court has been making efforts to\r\nupgrade its information technology network and has\r\ncontinued to develop its Internet site.\r\nThose various measures have already borne fruit\r\nin the form of new cases. The LaGrand case between\r\nGermany and the United States was thus brought to\r\njudgement in 26 months, and the Yerodia case between\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Belgium\r\ntook 16 months. The Court was able to rule on the\r\nadmissibility of Uganda’s counter-claims against the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo within seven\r\nmonths. It also ruled within seven months on the\r\nintervention sought by the Philippines in the case\r\nconcerning Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau\r\nSipadan. Requests for provisional measures have been\r\ndealt with in periods ranging from 24 hours to a few\r\nweeks.\r\nWe are continuing those efforts, while also\r\nensuring that the quality of our work is maintained, and\r\nwe hope that the budgetary authorities will, for their\r\npart, continue to make their contribution in that\r\nrespect. The Court today plays an important role in the\r\nprevention and resolution of international disputes.\r\nPeace between nations cannot be ensured by the work\r\nof the Court alone, but the Court can make a\r\nsubstantial contribution in this regard, and we welcome\r\nthe fact that an increasing number of States are\r\nbringing their disputes to us.\r\nThis growth in international litigation, however,\r\nposes a number of problems. I discussed such problems\r\nwith the Assembly last year, pointing out the risks that\r\nthe proliferation of international courts might pose to\r\nthe unity of international law. I suggested solutions to\r\nthose problems. They are just as relevant today, but I\r\nwill not repeat my comments this year.\r\nI would, however, once again like to raise the\r\nquestion of the special Trust Fund set up by the\r\nSecretary-General in 1989 to provide assistance to\r\nStates unable to afford the total cost of proceedings\r\nbefore the Court.\r\nJustice must be accessible to all. In every legal\r\nsystem there are arrangements — some more\r\nsatisfactory than others — enabling the poorest citizens\r\nto institute legal proceedings or to defend themselves\r\nagainst proceedings. The same ought to apply to the\r\nInternational Court.\r\nIt is true that access to the Court is free. However,\r\nsubmitting a dispute to the Court still incurs certain\r\ncosts: fees for agents, counsel, advocates and experts,\r\nas well as for the preparation and reproduction of\r\npleadings, annexes and geographical maps; expenses\r\nconnected with oral hearings and, in certain\r\ncases, those arising from the implementation of a\r\nJudgment — for example for the demarcation of a\r\nboundary fixed by the Court.\r\nSince its creation, the Secretary-General’s Trust\r\nFund to assist the poorest States to meet such\r\nexpenditures has undoubtedly played a useful role, but\r\nthat role has remained a limited one. The Court has,\r\ntherefore, asked me to pass on to the Assembly its\r\nconcerns in this regard.\r\nThose concerns are threefold. In the first place,\r\nthe Fund’s statute permits its use only in cases\r\nsubmitted by special agreement. That is more\r\nrestrictive than in the case of the funds set up,\r\nfollowing the United Nations example, for proceedings\r\nbefore the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea\r\nor the Permanent Court of Arbitration. It would seem\r\ndesirable that our Fund also intervene in any type of\r\ncase, provided that there was no dispute over\r\njurisdiction or the admissibility of applications or once\r\nany such objections had been dismissed. Similarly, the\r\ncategory of expenses that qualify for financing out of\r\nthe Fund should be enlarged, with a view to bringing\r\nthe text concerning the Court into line with other\r\napplicable texts.\r\nHowever, it is surprising that only four States\r\nhave approached the Fund since its creation, and one of\r\nthose decided not to draw on the promised sums\r\nbecause of the complexity of the procedures involved.\r\nIt has seemed to the Court that those procedures could\r\nbe simplified, and the Secretary-General has kindly\r\nundertaken measures to that effect. The question also\r\narises whether, under certain circumstances, States\r\nshould not be allowed to obtain advances.\r\nFinally, the Fund must have available sufficient\r\nresources to act. In that regard, I cannot thank enough\r\nthose States that have contributed, even recently, to the\r\nFund’s financing. But I note that such contributions\r\nhave significantly diminished over the years, both in\r\nnumber and in amount, and I appeal once again to the\r\nStates that are able to do so to increase the resources\r\navailable to the Fund.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nThe Court is not responsible for the management\r\nof the Fund. Nevertheless, it welcomes the\r\nimprovements already made in the Fund’s operations\r\nand hopes that, in the future, the Fund will be able to\r\ncarry out its mission in full.\r\nThe international community needs judges, and\r\nthe States that constitute it have become increasingly\r\naware of its need. The International Court of Justice\r\nwelcomes that fact, and I can assure the General\r\nAssembly that the Court will continue its efforts to\r\nrespond to the hopes that have been placed in it. The\r\nCourt thanks the Assembly for its assistance and counts\r\non its continued support in the coming years, in the\r\ninterests of justice, peace and law.\r\nMr. Stagno (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): At\r\nthe outset, I should like to thank the International Court\r\nof Justice for its report and Judge Guillaume for\r\npresenting it to us. I should also like to congratulate\r\nJudges Shi and Koroma on their well-deserved\r\nre-election, as well as Ambassadors Tomka and Owada\r\nand Professor Simma on their recent election to that\r\nlofty judicial organ.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes is one of the\r\nfundamental pillars of the United Nations.\r\nUndoubtedly, the existence of legitimate mechanisms\r\nand procedures to settle legal disputes is a precondition\r\nfor the harmonious development of international\r\nrelations. On the one hand, differing interpretations of\r\nthe law or of the facts may, once politicized, become\r\nthreats to international peace or security. Territorial\r\ncontroversies, in particular, may lead to a military\r\nescalation. In that context, the International Court of\r\nJustice provides a civilized alternative to the use of\r\nforce and plays a fundamental role in the society of\r\nnations. That is why we appreciate the Court’s role in\r\nthe promotion of peaceful relations among States.\r\nOn the other hand, the existence of legal\r\ncontroversies creates an environment that hardly\r\nfavours international cooperation. The lack of clear\r\nnorms and the existence of uncertainty regarding rights\r\nand obligations create an environment that does not\r\nencourage joint development and mutual assistance. In\r\nthat context, the Court’s judicial activity guarantees\r\nlegal certainty, clarifies the basic norms of\r\ninternational law and ensures the rule of law at the\r\ninternational level. Thus, we note the Court’s work in\r\nthe progressive development of contemporary\r\ninternational law. Its decisions, both in contentious\r\ncases and in advisory opinions, not only determine the\r\nlaw for the parties in conflict but also enlighten other\r\nStates with regard to obscure or controversial areas of\r\nthe law.\r\nRegrettably, the Court’s constructive work is\r\nhindered by the growing number of States that have\r\nplaced reservations or conditions on their declarations\r\nof acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. It\r\nis scandalous to observe that only 63 States have made\r\ndeclarations accepting its jurisdiction, in conformity\r\nwith Article 36 of its Statute. It is even more\r\nregrettable to note that only a dozen nations have\r\naccepted that jurisdiction without reservations or\r\nconditions.\r\nCosta Rica deems it essential that all States\r\naccept, without any limitation or restriction, the Court’s\r\ncompetence to consider contentious cases.\r\nDisregarding the authority of the highest judicial organ\r\nof the society of nations amounts to closing the door to\r\njustice and jeopardizes the integrity of the international\r\nlegal order. This responsibility belongs to all nations,\r\nbut in particular to those that have an additional\r\nresponsibility as permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the increase in the\r\nnumber of contentious cases on the Court’s agenda.\r\nThat positive fact reveals the international\r\ncommunity’s growing confidence in that judicial\r\norgan’s work and States’ willingness to submit to legal\r\nprinciples in the conduct of their international\r\nrelations. That is why we believe that incentives should\r\nbe provided for the introduction of new cases to the\r\nCourt and for frequent recourse to it.\r\nHowever, we note that the growing number of\r\ncases entails an increase in the institution’s workload.\r\nWe believe it necessary that the Court continue to\r\nconsider how to streamline its practices and working\r\nmethods to prevent delays in its consideration of cases.\r\nAt the same time, we believe it essential to provide the\r\nCourt with sufficient resources and staff so that it can\r\nadequately meet the new obligations arising from the\r\nincreased caseload. We trust that the Court will present\r\na request for additional resources in the next budgetary\r\ncycle.\r\nIn addition, I should like to emphasize the\r\nexcellent informational work accomplished by the\r\nCourt through the Internet. That service is invaluable\r\nfor developing nations, which sometimes encounter\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\ndifficulties in gaining access to the most recent\r\ndecisions. We trust that the Court will soon put the\r\ncomplete texts of all its previous decisions on its web\r\npage.\r\nFinally, I should like to reaffirm Costa Rica’s full\r\nconfidence in and firm support for the excellent work\r\nof the International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Cabrera (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation would like to thank the President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, for his clear presentation of the Court’s\r\nwork during the period 1 August 2001 to 31 July 2002.\r\nAs in other years, my country has taken the floor\r\non this topic because we are convinced of the value of\r\npeace, law and the preservation of harmonious\r\nrelations between States. The work of the Court during\r\nits 57 years of existence as the principal judicial organ\r\nof the United Nations testifies to its crucial role in that\r\nrespect.\r\nIn this regard, we are pleased to note the increase\r\nin the Court’s caseload over the past few years. I\r\nbelieve it is significant that, as noted in the report, as of\r\n31 July there were 24 cases on the Court’s docket,\r\nwhereas as in the 1970s it had only one or two cases on\r\nits docket at any one time. However, this increase will\r\nrequire the Court to meet the challenge of responding\r\nquickly and soundly to the increasingly complex cases\r\nbrought before it.\r\nThat challenge has been successfully met by the\r\nCourt, particularly since 1997, when it was decided to\r\nmake greater use of new technologies in its work. This\r\nimproved its working methods and achieved a greater\r\ndegree of collaboration among the various parties. In\r\nits efforts to work more efficiently and rapidly, in\r\nDecember 2000 the Court also modified its regulations\r\nconcerning preliminary objections and counter-claims.\r\nIt is still working on that reform.\r\nIn the context of this improvement of the Court’s\r\nprocedural requirements, my country, which has had\r\nrecourse to the Court in one instance, welcomes the\r\nrecent adoption of nine Practice Directions Additional\r\nto the Rules of the Court. The Directions, to enter into\r\neffect this month, seek not only to make the work of\r\nthe Court faster and more efficient, but also to improve\r\ncertain ethical standards in the application of law in\r\nspecific cases before it. In this regard, we note Practice\r\nDirection VII, which indicates that parties\r\n“should refrain from nominating persons who are\r\nacting as agent, counsel or advocate in another\r\ncase before the Court or have acted in that\r\ncapacity in the three years preceding the date of\r\nthe nomination”. (A/57/4, p. 99)\r\nSimilarly, Practice Direction VIII discourages the\r\nparticipation of any member of the Court as agent,\r\ncounsel or advocate in a case before the Court. We\r\nbelieve that these innovations will help to strengthen\r\nthe authority of the Court as the world’s principal legal\r\nbody.\r\nIn the context of providing the Court with better\r\ntools for the administration of justice, my delegation\r\nwas pleased to note that the General Assembly, in\r\nDecember 2001, approved an increase in the Court’s\r\nbudget for 2002-2003 by over $3.5 million, as well as a\r\nsorely needed increase in personnel. These logistic\r\nimprovements will enhance our expectations of the\r\nCourt’s work and hence increase its responsibility.\r\nWith respect to accessibility of funds for the\r\nCourt, my delegation would remind everyone of the\r\nexistence of the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to\r\nAssist States in the Settlement of Disputes through the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, established in 1989 to\r\nassist States that cannot meet the costs of bringing a\r\nclaim before the Court. It is of crucial importance that\r\ndonor countries redouble their efforts in capitalizing\r\nthe Fund. The cost of peace can never be compared to\r\nthe incalculable costs of war.\r\nWith regard to jurisprudence, my country is very\r\npleased by the Judgments handed down in the period\r\ncovered by the report. Particularly noteworthy was the\r\nJudgment of 14 February in a case between the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Belgium\r\nconcerning the issuance of an international arrest\r\nwarrant by the Belgian legal authorities against the\r\nthen Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo. In its Judgment, the Court\r\nfound that no exception existed with regard to the rule\r\nthat establishes immunity from criminal prosecution\r\nbefore foreign courts and inviolability for sitting\r\nministers for foreign affairs, even when they are\r\naccused of having committed war crimes or crimes\r\nagainst humanity.\r\nMy delegation, while expressing its respect for\r\nthe institution of immunity for certain Government\r\nrepresentatives, draws attention to the very thin line\r\nthat exists between the due exercise of immunities and\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nprivileges and the impunity which their evocation in\r\nbad faith can occasion. The Court recognizes this\r\nsituation by referring in its Judgment to the fact that\r\n“the immunities enjoyed did not imply impunity”\r\n(ibid., p. 4).\r\nMy country, which has been fighting a very\r\ndetermined battle against impunity, is currently\r\nundertaking the necessary measures to ensure that a\r\nformer head of State, having fled to an Asian country\r\nto escape justice, can be extradited to Peru in order to\r\nanswer to the very serious charges of which he is\r\naccused. We would hope that the sound evidence,\r\nconcurrent testimonies and material proof that we have\r\nsubmitted to Peruvian courts will convince those who\r\nare protecting him of the existence of serious and\r\nobjective substantiation that he must be subject to\r\njustice, in full respect for the due process of law.\r\nDespite the achievements at the International\r\nCourt of Justice to which we have referred, Peru feels\r\nit important to note that, unfortunately, the situations\r\nthat currently constitute the greatest threats to\r\ninternational peace and security are not within its\r\njurisdiction and are being dealt with through different\r\nchannels of action that may not be favourable to peace.\r\nThere is also another type of conflict, internal conflict,\r\nwhich by its very nature does not fall under the Court’s\r\njurisdiction, but which may pose very serious threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. The international\r\ncommunity must find a way to endow the system of\r\ninternational law with the necessary tools to encompass\r\nsuch cases, which are not currently under the Court’s\r\ncompetence but are threats to international peace.\r\nPeru, a country that throughout its history has\r\ndemonstrated strict respect for international law in its\r\nrelations and has always sought to solve all its disputes\r\npeacefully, will continue to spare no effort to ensure\r\nthat the International Court of Justice may continue to\r\nwork for the sake of peace, the rule of law and\r\nharmonious relations between nations.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): At the outset, allow me to congratulate the\r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge\r\nGilbert Guillaume, on the excellence of the Court’s\r\nreport covering the period from 1 August 2001 to 31\r\nJuly 2002, which he introduced to us with an eloquence\r\nand a precision worthy of a judge.\r\nI also take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute\r\nto all the high-level judges who strive every day with\r\ndevotion, rigour and self-sacrifice for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes and the development of\r\ninternational law so that lasting peace may reign\r\namong nations.\r\nA few days ago, the General Assembly partially\r\nrenewed the membership of the International Court of\r\nJustice. On behalf of Cameroon, it is my pleasure to\r\nextend to Judges Shi Jiuyong and Abdul Koroma the\r\ncongratulations of my Government on their re-election.\r\nWe also congratulate the three new Judges: Hisashi\r\nOwada, Peter Tomka and Bruno Simma.\r\nOn the occasion of the election of new members\r\nof the Court, Cameroon finds it difficult to resist the\r\ntemptation to remind members of the Assembly of\r\nwhat we stated concerning the principal judicial organ\r\nof the United Nations three years ago, almost to the\r\nday. On 26 October 1999, Cameroon said,\r\n“The Court can be proud of the authority it has\r\nconferred upon the process of judicial settlement,\r\nwhich was so long relegated to the margins. The\r\nCourt can be proud, in the words of President\r\nBedjaoui, of having secularized international\r\njustice and made it a landmark of our century.\r\nProof of this is the Court’s participation — of\r\ncourse, at the request of States — in the\r\nmanagement of the great concerns of the world\r\ntoday: security, human rights, the environment\r\nand so on.” (A/54/PV.39, p. 9)\r\nThe Judges rule on major issues connected with\r\nthe sovereignty of States. They do this with pride, of\r\ncourse, but also, and above all, with great seriousness\r\nand humility. How could it be otherwise? After all,\r\nthey know that for human beings to render justice for\r\nother human beings is a difficult thing, because it\r\ninvolves nearly metaphysical problems of conscience.\r\n“Judges of the Earth, you are gods.” This remark by\r\nHenri-François d’Aguesseau is more a reflection of a\r\nkeen sense of responsibility than an expression of\r\nadmiration. If justice rendered by human beings with\r\nregard to other human beings is, indeed, difficult, what\r\nare we then to say of justice rendered by human beings\r\nwith regard to States? This is just as difficult and as\r\nintimidating, in the light of the important interests that\r\nare increasingly at stake.\r\nThe report on the activities of the Court before\r\nthe General Assembly (A/57/4) is particularly\r\nsignificant in this regard. The report is rich and dense,\r\nand it contains very useful information. With the\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nAssembly’s permission, I would like to focus on two\r\naspects of this important document. I would like to\r\noffer an analysis of its content and then to make some\r\nobservations on the judicial activities of the Court.\r\nSince its creation in 1946, the Court has made a\r\nmajor contribution to the implementation of the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nin the matter of international peace and security and the\r\ndevelopment and strengthening of friendly relations\r\namong States. Over the years, the increasing recourse\r\nby States to judicial settlement of their disputes has\r\ngiven the International Court of Justice a central place\r\nin the administration of international justice and the\r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes. To date,\r\n191 States have become parties to the Court’s Statute.\r\nThe optional clause relating to the binding jurisdiction\r\nof the Court has been accepted by 63 States. The Court\r\nnow has 23 cases on its docket. These cases, as the\r\nPresident of the Court reminded us a moment ago,\r\ncover four continents and the most diverse domains.\r\nFurthermore, 260 bilateral or multilateral conventions\r\nhave given the Court competence to deal with disputes\r\narising from their application or interpretation. This\r\nshows the decisive role that the world’s highest court\r\ntoday plays in dealing with relations among States and\r\nthe attainment of the relevant objectives enshrined in\r\nthe Charter.\r\nMy country welcomes all the measures taken by\r\nthe Court to improve its work and make it more\r\neffective. We still have to give it adequate resources to\r\nenable it to continue to fulfil it mandate — and to do so\r\nmore expeditiously.\r\nTwo judgments and 15 orders have been laid\r\ndown by the International Court of Justice over the last\r\nyear. Some people of course, will be prompted to\r\nunderestimate this record, but when we realize the\r\ncomplexity, the delicacy and the sensitivity — in short,\r\nthe difficulty — arising from the stakes involved in the\r\ncases brought by States to the Court, my delegation can\r\nonly commend the results.\r\nThe annual report of the International Court of\r\nJustice tells us that it has 24 cases on its dossier.\r\nMembers will have noted that I earlier spoke of 23\r\ncases. In so doing, I was only following Judge\r\nGuillaume, who, in his statement today, dwelt for a few\r\nmoments on the case of the land and maritime border\r\nbetween the Republic of Cameroon and the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria. In handing down its Judgment in\r\nthis case on 10 October, the International Court of\r\nJustice, which is a jurisdiction and which pronounced\r\nthe law — juris dictio — put an end to more than eight\r\nyears of expensive proceedings.\r\nSpeaking on 11 October 2002 about this\r\nJudgment, which is the indisputable expression of the\r\nexisting law, the President of the Republic of\r\nCameroon, His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, clearly\r\nindicated that\r\n“This Judgment is final and cannot be appealed.\r\nCameroon takes note of this. As a State bound by\r\nthe rule of law, Cameroon undertakes to comply\r\nwith it, as laid down in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. Cameroon is convinced that it is through\r\nthe parties’ respect for and application of the\r\ndecision of the Court that the border dispute\r\nbetween the two countries will finally be\r\npeacefully resolved for the greatest good of our\r\ntwo fraternal peoples.”\r\nThe voluntary and rapid implementation of the\r\nCourt’s rulings is an important indication of its\r\nacceptance — an act of faith — which makes recourse\r\nto the Court something that is important and makes\r\ngood sense. Otherwise, what would be the point of\r\naccepting the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, of\r\nbringing cases before it or appearing before it? What\r\nwould be the point, if its verdicts were not accepted?\r\nArticle 2, paragraph 2, of the Charter states:\r\n“All Members, in order to ensure to all of them\r\nthe rights and benefits resulting from\r\nmembership, shall fulfil in good faith the\r\nobligations assumed by them in accordance with\r\nthe present Charter.”\r\nArticle 94, paragraph 1, of the Charter states:\r\n“Each Member of the United Nations undertakes\r\nto comply with the decision of the International\r\nCourt of Justice in any case to which it is a\r\nparty.”\r\nThose two Charter Articles leave nothing further to be\r\nstated.\r\nCameroon welcomes the commitment of the\r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, expressed before the\r\njudgment was handed down, to respect the Court’s\r\nverdict. The international community rightly welcomes\r\nthe proactive approach of Presidents Paul Biya of\r\nCameroon and Obasanjo of Nigeria, who went beyond\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nagreeing to accept the judgment and on 5 September\r\n2002 at the initiative of and in the presence of the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\noutlined confidence-building measures and decided,\r\nwith the support of the Organization of African Unity,\r\nto create an implementation mechanism for the\r\njudgment of the Court. In that spirit, on 30 September\r\n2002 and for the first time in nearly a decade,\r\nCameroon and Nigeria held a session of the Joint\r\nCommission in Abuja, 10 days before the Court handed\r\ndown its verdict.\r\nMy country remains convinced of the\r\ndetermination of the Governments of the two countries\r\nto work together to implement the Judgment rapidly\r\nand completely in a spirit of African fraternity and in\r\nthe enlightened interest of their two peoples. Cameroon\r\nand Nigeria have had here an opportunity to confirm\r\nbefore the whole international community their\r\ndedication to peace and the rule of law. For its part,\r\nCameroon, a State based on the rule of law, reaffirms\r\nsolemnly before the Assembly its commitment to\r\ncomply with the Court’s verdict and to promote its\r\nimmediate implementation.\r\nI cannot conclude this statement without paying\r\nwarm tribute, on behalf of the President of the\r\nRepublic of Cameroon, His Excellency Paul Biya, to\r\nthe whole Court for its impartiality in the conduct of its\r\nproceedings. Cameroon also wishes to express its\r\nwholehearted appreciation to the Secretary-General,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his past and future\r\ninitiatives and his commitment to maintaining the\r\nfraternal, friendly, good neighbourly and cooperative\r\nrelations that tie Nigeria and Cameroon. We must not\r\nforget all the other members of the international\r\ncommunity that have made positive contributions to the\r\nsettlement of this dispute, and that, we are certain, will\r\ncontinue to help the two neighbouring countries bring\r\nabout the rapid and full implementation of the Court’s\r\nverdict, thus putting an end to this dispute.\r\nMr. Cheah Sam Kip (Malaysia): My delegation\r\nwishes to thank the Honourable Judge Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, President of the International Court of\r\nJustice, for his lucid presentation of the report of the\r\nCourt, contained in document A/57/4. The President’s\r\noral presentation this morning has been most\r\nilluminating and has given us food for thought. A\r\ncomprehensive report is extremely useful in enabling\r\nMember States to understand and appreciate the\r\ncomplexity of the work of the Court. My delegation\r\nwould also like to extend its felicitations to the recently\r\nelected judges of the Court.\r\nWe would like to compliment the Court on its\r\ncontribution to the peaceful settlement of international\r\ndisputes. As the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations, the Court has undoubtedly played an\r\nimportant and influential role in the promotion of peace\r\nand harmony between nations and peoples of the world\r\nthrough the rule of law. We are pleased to note that, as\r\nof 18 September 2002, the Court has delivered 74\r\njudgments since 1946, when it replaced the Permanent\r\nCourt of International Justice. Those judgments cover a\r\nwide range of disputes concerning, inter alia, land\r\nfrontiers and maritime boundaries, territorial\r\nsovereignty, the non-use of force, non-interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of States, diplomatic relations, the\r\nright to asylum, nationality, guardianship, rights of\r\npassage and economic rights.\r\nIt has also given 24 advisory opinions,\r\nconcerning, inter alia, admission to United Nations\r\nmembership, reparation for injuries suffered in the\r\nservice of the United Nations, the territorial status of\r\nSouth-West Africa (Namibia) and Western Sahara,\r\njudgments rendered by international administrative\r\ntribunals, expenses of certain United Nations\r\noperations, the applicability of the United Nations\r\nHeadquarters Agreement, the status of human rights\r\nrapporteurs and the legality of the threat or use of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nIndeed, more and more States are referring their\r\ndisputes to the Court for final settlement. That increase\r\nin cases before the Court reflects the recognition of the\r\nwisdom and fairness of that body, as evidenced by the\r\nexcellent quality of the judgments and opinions it has\r\nhanded down and their acceptance by the parties\r\nconcerned.\r\nMalaysia’s confidence in the International Court\r\nof Justice strengthens its belief that the Court is the\r\nmost suitable forum for seeking a peaceful and final\r\nsolution to disputes when all diplomatic efforts have\r\nbeen exhausted. Therefore, Malaysia, in mutual\r\nagreement with Indonesia, decided to submit the\r\nterritorial dispute between them over Pulau Ligitan and\r\nPulau Sipadan, for adjudication by the Court. We look\r\nforward to the Court’s judgment and, consistent with\r\nour abiding respect for international law, will fully\r\nrespect it.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nMy delegation believes that the significant\r\nincrease in the number of cases on the docket of the\r\nCourt to 24 augurs well for the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law and the role of the\r\nCourt as a dispute settlement mechanism. We welcome\r\nthe acceptance by 63 States of the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction, in accordance with article 36, paragraph 2,\r\nof the Statute. We also note with interest that some 260\r\nbilateral or multilateral treaties have granted the Court\r\njurisdiction in the resolution of disputes arising out of\r\nthe application or the interpretation of the treaties\r\nconcerned. Those welcome developments clearly\r\ndemonstrate the increasing confidence in the decisions\r\nof the Court and reliance on the settlement of disputes\r\nthrough adjudication rather than through the use of\r\nforce. This manifestation of confidence in the rule of\r\nlaw is particularly important at this point in time.\r\nIn view of the increase in the workload of the\r\nCourt, my delegation believes that there is an urgent\r\nneed to strengthen the Court’s capacity to efficiently\r\ndispose of the cases before it and to undertake the\r\nadditional administrative responsibilities arising\r\ntherefrom. In that respect, we welcome the\r\nimprovements with regard to personnel requirements.\r\nHowever, we hope that the difficulties caused by the\r\nreduction of budget credits for programme support can\r\nbe overcome.\r\nMy delegation commends the Court for its efforts\r\nto increase public awareness and understanding of its\r\nwork in the judicial settlement of international\r\ndisputes, its advisory functions, case law and working\r\nmethods, as well as its role within the United Nations,\r\nthrough its publications and lectures by the President,\r\nother members of the Court, the Registrar and members\r\nof the Registry staff.\r\nWe welcome the Court’s distribution of press\r\nreleases, its background notes and its handbook, which\r\nkeep the public informed about its work, functions and\r\njurisdiction. In that regard, we congratulate the Court\r\non its extremely useful web site. We believe it is well\r\nutilized by lawyers, students, academics, diplomats and\r\ninterested members of the public as an important point\r\nof access to the Court’s judgments, which constitute\r\nthe most recent developments in international case law.\r\nMr. Lobatch (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): Permit me first to thank Judge Guillaume for\r\nintroducing the thorough report of the International\r\nCourt of Justice (ICJ). The Russian Federation has\r\ntraditionally attached great importance to the work of\r\nthe Court, which is a unique international organ with\r\ngeneral jurisdiction. That accounts for its key role\r\nwithin the system of international relations, as an\r\ninstrument for the peaceful settlement of disputes\r\nbetween States.\r\nThe past decade has undoubtedly been marked by\r\na rising interest on the part of States in the Court, as\r\nclearly demonstrated by the increase in the number of\r\ncases on the Court’s docket, and by the increase in the\r\nscope and geographical range of applications to the\r\nCourt.\r\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the Court’s\r\ncontribution to the progressive development of\r\ninternational law. Of particular interest in that context\r\nis the Judgment of 14 February 2002 in the case\r\nbetween the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nBelgium, with regard to the issuing by the Belgian law\r\nenforcement agencies of a warrant for the arrest of the\r\nformer Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo. Another important issue from the\r\nstandpoint of international law was the Court’s ruling\r\nin a matter pertaining to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, namely the case\r\nbetween the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nRwanda.\r\nWe particularly hail the Court’s Advisory\r\nOpinions on various issues of interpretation of\r\ninternational law. We believe that, with the passage of\r\ntime, the role of the Court’s Advisory Opinions will\r\ngrow. In the light of the substantial growth in recent\r\nyears in the number of other international courts and\r\ntribunals, we think it entirely proper to consider the\r\npossibility that those other institutions could in future\r\napply to the ICJ for Advisory Opinions. That might\r\nprevent judicial contradictions, which, if they arose,\r\nmight in certain circumstances considerably impede the\r\nprogressive development of international law.\r\nHere, of course, we are not speaking of the\r\nestablishment of any particular hierarchy of the organs\r\nof international justice. We commend the Court for its\r\nefforts in recent years to rationalize and simplify its\r\nworking procedures. We believe this should lead to a\r\nsizeable decrease in the amount of time needed to deal\r\nwith its cases. But in this area, not all problems have\r\nyet been resolved. We look forward to further plans to\r\nincrease the productivity of the Court. The Court’s\r\ncompletion of its important work depends on adequate\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nfinancing; there is long overdue need for increasing its\r\nbudget. We support such proposals and call on all other\r\nStates to do so too. It is a pleasure to note that in recent\r\nyears the alarming situation with regard to inadequate\r\nfinancing has begun to improve. It is our belief that\r\nefforts to increase the budget should be continued.\r\nAt the same time, let me encourage the process of\r\nincreasing the staff of the Court and strengthening its\r\ntechnical resources. Without this, any improvement in\r\nits work would be unthinkable. The process deserves\r\nour support. We believe that the General Assembly\r\nshould reaffirm readiness to continue assisting the\r\nCourt in solving its current problems.\r\nThe noticeably increasing trend over the past few\r\nyears for States to willing apply to the Court for the\r\nsettlement of disputes between them testifies to the\r\ngreater confidence of States in the ability of the Court\r\nto find effective and just solutions to disputes, and in\r\nthe Court’s authority to ensure the implementation of\r\nits verdicts.\r\nMore and more often, States are recognizing the\r\nCourt as a guarantor of compliance with the Charter\r\nand other fundamental rules of international law.\r\nMr. Shinoda (Japan): It is my great pleasure and\r\nhonour, on behalf of the Government of Japan, to\r\naddress the Assembly under the presidency of His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Kavan. My delegation would like\r\nto thank Judge Gilbert Guillaume for his report\r\ndescribing the current situation of the International\r\nCourt of Justice (ICJ). I am especially pleased to have\r\nthis opportunity to congratulate those who were elected\r\nto the Court last week. We hope that, with these newly\r\nelected judges, the Court will continue to effectively\r\ntackle the difficult cases brought to its jurisdiction. My\r\ndelegation would also like to express its appreciation\r\nfor the dedication and valuable contributions of those\r\njudges who will leave the Court in February 2003.\r\nMy delegation greatly appreciates the excellent\r\nreport of the ICJ (A/57/4), and the detailed explanation\r\nof the current situation of the Court by its President,\r\nJudge Guillaume. There is no doubt that the Court,\r\nwith its rich history, broad material jurisdiction and\r\nhighly refined jurisprudence, and as the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, has firmly\r\nestablished its status as the world’s senior international\r\ncourt.\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe goal of establishing and maintaining the\r\nprimacy of integrated international law is of\r\nunquestioned importance. In the current situation, as\r\nwe observe the armed conflicts and acts of terrorism\r\nthat continue to erupt, the role of the International\r\nCourt of Justice as a credible mechanism for promoting\r\ninternational peace and security is more important than\r\never before. As stressed in the resolution on the\r\nprevention of armed conflict, which was adopted at the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, it is\r\nimportant to resort more frequently to the International\r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nMy delegation believes that fostering peace\r\nthrough the adjudicated settlement of international\r\ndisputes and the development of the body of\r\ninternational law has become an irrefutable universal\r\nvalue today. Japan is a country resolutely devoted to\r\npeace and firmly dedicated to respect for international\r\nlaw. Its commitment to the principle of peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes is demonstrated through its\r\nacceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction by\r\nits deposit of a declaration to that effect in accordance\r\nwith paragraph 2 of Article 36 of the Statute of the\r\nCourt.\r\nIn that regard, it is also worth recalling operative\r\nparagraph 9 of the draft resolution on the prevention\r\nand peaceful settlement of disputes, which was agreed\r\nby the Working Group of the Special Committee of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. That draft resolution\r\nreminds States to declare their recognition of the\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of\r\nJustice. Sixty-three States have so far done so, and we\r\nhope that many more States will join them.\r\nJapan is pleased to note that, despite the increase\r\nin the number and diversity of cases, the Court has\r\nbeen able to process them without excessive delays,\r\nthanks to the increased budget approved by the General\r\nAssembly, as well as to the various measures the Court\r\nhas taken to rationalize its work.\r\nAs of 31 July 2002, 24 cases were pending before\r\nthe Court. We appreciate the increased confidence\r\nwhich States have shown in the Court’s ability to\r\nresolve their disputes and hope that the Court will\r\ncontinue to carry out its judicial tasks during the 2002-\r\n2003 session. Japan strongly believes that the Court is\r\nmaking a genuine contribution to strengthening the rule\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nof law and to preventing and resolving international\r\ncrises.\r\nJapan is also acting according to its principles by\r\nproviding competent personnel to the Court. Indeed,\r\nJapan’s distinguished lawyers have a long history of\r\ncontributing to the World Court’s jurisprudence. In the\r\nelections held last week, Ambassador Hisashi Owada\r\nwas elected as Judge of the Court. Ambassador Owada\r\nhas excellent knowledge of international law and broad\r\nexperience as a diplomat. We are confident that he will\r\nprovide invaluable insights into the area of\r\ninternational justice.\r\nIn concluding my remarks, I wish to reaffirm, on\r\nbehalf of my delegation, the great importance which\r\nthe Government of Japan attaches to the lofty cause\r\nand work of the International Court of Justice as the\r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Robledo (Mexico) (Spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation expresses its gratitude to the President of\r\nthe International Court of Justice, Judge Gilbert\r\nGuillaume, for the very detailed report he has\r\npresented, and we pay tribute to the principal judicial\r\norgan of the United Nations for its contribution to the\r\npeaceful solution of disputes between States and the\r\ndevelopment of international law. The confidence\r\nshown by the international community towards the\r\nCourt’s judicial practice is evident. The Court’s\r\nworkload is indicative of the degree of political and\r\nlegal support that States give to the Court as an\r\nimpartial and independent legal entity.\r\nThrough its constant growth and development,\r\nthe Court has not ignored the needs its own success has\r\nimposed on it. The streamlining of its procedures and\r\nthe improvement of its working methods have been\r\nbasic ingredients in the strategic planning of its\r\nfunctioning in order to be able to respond to the\r\ndemands and needs of international life in the new\r\ncentury. Mexico recognizes the Court’s efforts in those\r\nareas and encourages the parties to disputes to\r\ncooperate fully with the Court by following its\r\ndirectives. In the final analysis, the full cooperation of\r\nthe parties concerned is the best way to reduce the time\r\ndevoted to each case.\r\nWith respect to the legal practice of the Court in\r\nthe last year, my delegation attaches special importance\r\nto its ruling on the case concerning the Arrest Warrant\r\nof 11 April 2000 involving the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and Belgium, as well as to the case\r\nconcerning the land and maritime borders between\r\nCameroon and Nigeria.\r\nThe case involving the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo and Belgium has undoubted relevance for\r\ncontemporary international law, in particular through\r\nits attempt to clarify the interaction between two legal\r\ninstitutions: the immunity of foreign ministers and\r\nindividual criminal responsibility for crimes of\r\ninternational magnitude. We appreciate that the Court\r\nfully considered the need to preserve the institution of\r\ndiplomatic immunity by virtue of the role it plays in\r\nthe stability of the international community. We\r\nrecognize that striking a balance between that\r\nimmunity and new trends in international criminal law\r\nis no easy task. We will therefore have to await another\r\nopportunity to find the definitive solution to the issue\r\nof immunity in general as it relates to the commission\r\nof crimes of importance to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nAlthough we are aware that neither of the parties\r\nin the case is requesting the Court to deliver a ruling on\r\nthe issue of universal jurisdiction, the international\r\ncommunity will have to await another time to receive a\r\nlegal ruling on both the legal regime and material\r\ncontent of the general issue.\r\nWe welcome the Court’s recent ruling on 10\r\nOctober in the case involving Cameroon and Nigeria.\r\nWe are aware of the complexity of the technical and\r\nhistorical information with which the Court had to\r\nbecome familiar in order to deliver a ruling. We believe\r\nthat the ruling is of great importance for peaceful\r\nrelations between States in West Africa by delimiting\r\nborders in the areas around Lake Chad, the Bakassi\r\nPeninsula, the land border between Lake Chad and the\r\nPeninsula and the maritime border between the two\r\ncountries. We note with approval that the Court is\r\ncontinuing to refine its extensive jurisprudence in the\r\narea of delimiting maritime borders, in particular when\r\nrequired to delimit the continental shelf and exclusive\r\neconomic zones by means of a single line, as in the\r\ncase being discussed. Without doubt, that accumulated\r\nexperience is fundamental in order for the Court to rule\r\non cases involving maritime borders in the Caribbean\r\nSea. Mexico will very carefully follow those\r\ndevelopments by virtue of which it has been providing\r\nthe necessary resources to facilitate access to technical\r\nassistance with a view to entering bilateral negotiations\r\non delimiting maritime borders or requesting a legal\r\nruling.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nIn that regard, Mexico notes with approval the\r\nremarks by the President of the Court on the operations\r\nof the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund and fully agrees\r\nwith the observations of the President of the Court with\r\nrespect to the means to be implemented to ensure\r\ngreater accessibility for the States so desiring. We also\r\nnote with satisfaction the remarks of the President of\r\nthe Court concerning the functioning of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Trust Fund and we fully agree with the\r\nopinion of the President with the respect to means for\r\nimproving accessibility to the Fund by States who need\r\nit.\r\nAdditionally, and my delegation notes with\r\nsatisfaction the decision of the Court to allow\r\nEquatorial Guinea to intervene during the Cameroon\r\nand Nigerian dispute which enriches the jurisprudence\r\nof the Court and which takes place under Article 62 of\r\nits Statute. Though Equatorial Guinea did not\r\nparticipate as a party, its presence did facilitate the\r\nwork of the Court by including its viewpoints in\r\nestablishing that maritime border between the\r\naforementioned States.\r\nThe intense work of the Court in the last two\r\nyears and its crucial role in the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes demands that members of the international\r\ncommunity continue to support it. The Court will\r\ncontinue to play an important role in the international\r\nlegal sphere, to which we have added new institutions,\r\nall of which work for the benefit of the international\r\ncommunity. Mexico continues to provide its support to\r\nall of the machinery which promotes a peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes between States.\r\nMr. Tan Ken Hwee (Singapore) (spoke in\r\nEnglish): Let me begin by congratulating the\r\nInternational Court of Justice (ICJ) on a full and\r\nproductive year. We can only marvel at how the Court\r\nhas managed to do so much, with the limited resources\r\nallocated to it, a matter which I shall return to later.\r\nSingapore would like to congratulate the re-\r\nelected and newly elected members of the Court,\r\nJudges Shi Jiuyong (China), Abdul G. Koroma (Sierra\r\nLeone), Hisashi Owada (Japan), Bruno Simma\r\n(Germany) and Peter Tomka (Slovakia). Singapore is\r\ncertain that these judges will, in accordance with the\r\nwill of the international community, expressed through\r\nthe voting in this Assembly and at the Security\r\nCouncil, serve with distinction, skill and wisdom.\r\nSingapore also offers thanks for the services of\r\nJudges Shigeru Oda (Japan), Géza Herczegh (Hungary)\r\nand Carl-August Fleischhauer (Germany). The\r\ninternational community is indebted to these gentlemen\r\nfor their faithful and dedicated service to the Court. We\r\nhope that each of them will discover, or more\r\nappropriately, rediscover, other ways to contribute to\r\nthe development of international law.\r\nSingapore firmly believes that there must be\r\ncredible and reliable institutions, empowered to\r\nadjudicate disputes between States. While certain\r\ncultures may avoid litigation, preferring less\r\nconfrontational dispute resolution methodologies, or\r\nnegotiated settlements, there are, unfortunately,\r\nsituations which cannot be resolved except through a\r\nformal adjudication process. In such situations, the ICJ\r\nplays a crucial role. The ICJ provides an efficient\r\nmechanism for the adjudication of international\r\ndisputes, and States are increasingly willing to avail\r\nthemselves of the Court for this purpose. In addition,\r\nthe Court also plays an important role in enunciating\r\nprinciples of international law, for the guidance of all\r\ncountries. This can help to prevent disputes in the first\r\nplace.\r\nTherefore, like others, we have noted with\r\nconcern the creation of numerous specialized courts\r\nand tribunals. There is a risk that this would lead to\r\nfragmentation of international law, and we note that the\r\nInternational Law Commission will deal with this\r\ncomplex subject.\r\nOn our part, we would like to state that while\r\nthere is no formal hierarchy of courts in international\r\nlaw, it is clear to us that the International Court of\r\nJustice is first among equals. Many treaties may\r\nestablish separate judicial or decision-making bodies.\r\nHowever, the ICJ remains the principal judicial organ\r\nof the United Nations. The Court has discharged its\r\ngrowing responsibilities in this regard with ever-\r\nincreasing professionalism and expertise.\r\nWe would have preferred to have had more time\r\nto study the report of the Court, and note with some\r\nregret that the report, although dated 6 September\r\n2002, was only made available to Member States\r\nyesterday, 28 October 2002. This has severely limited\r\nour opportunity to study and to reflect upon the\r\ncontents of what is a comprehensive report. We are\r\ntherefore only able to make general statements about\r\nthe work of the Court.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nWe note that in the period under review, the Court\r\nhas had to deal with a request for it to indicate\r\nprovisional measures, and a request for permission to\r\nintervene. The Court conducted public hearings in\r\nrespect of four cases, handed down rulings in respect of\r\nfour cases, and dealt with numerous procedural matters\r\nin respect of other pending cases.\r\nWhat is clear to us all is that the Court has\r\nbecome rather busy. The number of cases on its docket\r\nseems to be growing all the time. In fact, in the period\r\nunder review, the Court was seized with three more\r\ncases. It is therefore gratifying to Singapore, and to the\r\ninternational community as a whole, to note that the\r\nCourt seems to be coping with the situation.\r\nIn addition to conducting public hearings,\r\ndeliberating on cases, and handling and managing\r\nprocedural matters, the Court has found time to adopt\r\nPractice Directions and has taken other measures to\r\nimprove its working methods and to accelerate its\r\nprocedures.\r\nSingapore notes these efforts with satisfaction.\r\nThey will no doubt help to streamline the overall\r\nlitigation process that parties to a dispute have to\r\nnavigate through. These efforts resonate well with\r\nSingapore. Domestically, our courts have also imposed\r\ncase management disciplines and strategies to ensure\r\nthat cases are disposed of efficiently.\r\nSingapore also acknowledges, as others before us,\r\nand is thankful for the excellent efforts of the Registry\r\nof the ICJ in maintaining a comprehensive web site,\r\nwhich is constantly updated with the latest status of\r\nany case on the Court’s docket. The diligence with\r\nwhich the site is updated makes it an essential tool for\r\nany country wishing to keep updated on the work of the\r\nCourt. The automated e-mail newsletters from the\r\nCourt further complement the web site. In all, the\r\narsenal of technological tools deployed by the Court is\r\nimpressive and reflects and enhances the importance\r\nand influence of the Court.\r\nWe have always been concerned about the level\r\nof funding available to the ICJ. It seems as if the Court\r\nis left with the unenviable task of doing increasingly\r\nmore work, with a very modest number of staff, and an\r\neven more modest budget.\r\nWe hope that other Member States will share this\r\nconcern. The Advisory Committee on Administrative\r\nand Budgetary Questions agreed to an increase in the\r\napproved headcount and budget of the Court for the\r\ncurrent biennium. However, there were cuts in the\r\nCourt’s programme support budget. This is akin to\r\ngiving with one hand, and taking with the other. It\r\nbears repeating that the ICJ has a budget about one\r\ntenth that of the International Tribunals for the former\r\nYugoslavia and for Rwanda. While Singapore does not\r\nsuggest that those Tribunals are over-funded, we do\r\nworry that the ICJ continues to be under-funded,\r\ndespite the recent increase in budget.\r\nIn conclusion, Singapore has always been and\r\nwill remain to be supportive of the Court. We monitor,\r\nand pay the greatest possible attention to each new\r\ndecision of the Court, either in disputes between\r\nparties, or in respect of advisory opinions. While there\r\nis no doctrine of stare decisis or judicial precedent in\r\ninternational law, we believe that the ICJ sets the tone,\r\nand that its judicial pronouncements should be given\r\nthe greatest possible regard by States and other courts\r\nand tribunals.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): Allow me at the\r\noutset to thank Judge Guillaume, President of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, for the introduction of\r\nthe report of the Court on its work and thank the Court\r\nfor its continued good work during the past year.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate newly elected and re-elected members of\r\nthe Court and wish them success in their noble tasks to\r\nstrengthen and uphold the rule of law and justice.\r\nThe role of the ICJ, which is the only\r\ninternational court of universal character with general\r\njurisdiction, is increasing in the post-cold war era.\r\nToday the Court plays an important role in promoting\r\nfriendly relations among nations, the peaceful\r\nsettlement of disputes, the prevention of conflicts, the\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law and the progressive\r\ndevelopment of international law.\r\nAs can be seen in the report, which was updated\r\nrecently, today 191 States are parties to the Statute, 63\r\nof which have accepted the Court’s compulsory\r\njurisdiction, in accordance with article 36, paragraph 2,\r\nof the Statute. Furthermore, some 260 bilateral and\r\nmultilateral treaties provide for the Court’s jurisdiction\r\nin the resolution of disputes arising out of their\r\napplication or interpretation. This and other relevant\r\ninformation on the status and activities of the Court can\r\nbe found in the report, which my delegation finds rich\r\nand well structured.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nIn the period under consideration, the number of\r\ncases before the Court has increased further to 24.\r\nThey cover all continents and are varied, including\r\nterritorial and boundary disputes, status of nationals\r\nand property of States, cases relating to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and\r\nothers. The large number of cases on the Court’s docket\r\nreflects the increased confidence of States in the Court,\r\nin its judgments and in its impartiality.\r\nIn the period under review, the Court issued a\r\nnumber of important judgments, including with regard\r\nto the case concerning sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan\r\nand Pulau Sipadan, between Indonesia and Malaysia,\r\nand the case between the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo and Belgium concerning the issuance of arrest\r\nwarrants. The latter decision, as the report points out,\r\nended a dispute concerning a question of great\r\nimportance in international relations. It underlined that\r\nimmunity does not necessarily imply impunity.\r\nLikewise, the judgment relating to the case of\r\nArmed Activities on the Territory of Congo made an\r\nimportant finding: that States remain liable for actions\r\ncontrary to international law for which they may be\r\nresponsible and that they are required to respect their\r\ninternational obligations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the further steps taken\r\nby the Court to shorten and simplify its proceedings, in\r\nparticular as regards preliminary objections and\r\ncounter-claims as well as the adoption of Practice\r\nDirections additional to the Rules of the Court, as\r\nreflected in paragraphs 368-373 of the report. Thus, as\r\na result of simplification, in some cases it was possible\r\nto consider in a single phase both questions of\r\njurisdiction and admissibility, and the merits.\r\nThe introduction of amendments to article 79 of\r\nits 1978 Rules, dealing with preliminary objections,\r\nand Article 80, relating to counter-claims, have made it\r\npossible, in certain cases, to shorten the duration of\r\nincidental proceedings.\r\nLike previous speakers, my delegation would like\r\nto commend the Court for its excellent work. As can be\r\nseen in the report, the judicial year 2002-2003\r\npromises to be very busy. In order effectively to\r\ndischarge its basic functions, the Court, which,\r\naccording to Article 92 of the Charter, is the principal\r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, needs adequate\r\nfinancial resources. Compared to the two ad hoc\r\nTribunals established by the Security Council, whose\r\nreports were considered yesterday by the Assembly, the\r\nInternational Court of Justice is seriously underfunded\r\nwhile its docket is overburdened. Insufficient\r\nbudgetary resources would only hamper the work of\r\nthe Court in the discharge of its functions, adding to its\r\nalready huge backlog. My delegation therefore\r\nsupports a reasonable increase in the Court’s budget,\r\nbearing in mind the increased number of cases on the\r\ndocket and the backlog, despite the across-the-board\r\ncuts to support programmes imposed on all United\r\nNations bodies.\r\nWe take note of the threefold concern expressed\r\nby the President of the Court as to this special fund. We\r\nare in favour of facilitating access by the poorest\r\ncountries to the Court through this fund, to enable them\r\nto meet the expenses incurred in the course of\r\nsubmitting disputes to the Court. In this respect, my\r\ndelegation fully supports the statement made by\r\nPresident Guillaume that access to international justice\r\nshould not be impeded by financial inequality.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nunderline the fact that, in line with its policy of\r\nsupporting the strengthening of the rule of law and the\r\nprevention and resolution of disputes by peaceful\r\nmeans, Mongolia expresses its full confidence in the\r\nwork of the Court and wishes it further success in the\r\ndischarge of its noble functions, as defined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and its Statute.\r\nMr. Lavalle-Valdés (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Allow me at the outset to express our deep\r\nappreciation to the President of the Court, Judge\r\nGilbert Guillaume, for having made the effort to come\r\nto this busy city, putting aside many of his burdensome\r\nregular duties to take on an additional but different\r\none —  that of introducing to us, which his usual\r\nlucidity and insight, the annual report of the Court. Our\r\nrecognition and thanks must also be retroactive,\r\nbecause this is third consecutive time that President\r\nGuillaume has carried out this task. We would\r\ntherefore like to thank him, both retroactively and in\r\nadvance, for his interesting statements before the Sixth\r\nCommittee and other bodies of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation would like to congratulate the five\r\njurists who have just been elected members of the\r\nCourt, two for the second time and three for the first.\r\nWe wish them every success in their work and in the\r\nexercise of the functions that they will assume or\r\ncontinue to carry out.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nMy delegation is pleased to see that, now that\r\nSwitzerland has joined the Organization, there is no\r\nlonger any State that belongs to the somewhat strange\r\ncategory of countries that are parties to the Statute of\r\nthe Court but not Members of the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve that the elimination —  symbolic as it may be —\r\nof this category strengthens the links between the Court\r\nand the United Nations, and we hope that this category\r\nof States is now part of history, so that in future any\r\nState that becomes party to the Statute of the Court\r\nwill, just as Timor-Leste has done —  and we would like\r\nto congratulate it for this —  simultaneously become\r\nboth a party to the Statute and a Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe famous jurist Hugo Grotius pointed out\r\nhumorously that because, even though some might\r\ndeny it, the international community is, in the final\r\nanalysis, made up of human beings, it cannot exist\r\nwithout the rule of law —  an indispensable element for\r\nany community. This is also clearly expressed, with a\r\nsimplicity that contrasts with Grotius’ Ciceronian turns\r\nof phrase, in the Latin adage — which I believe\r\neveryone is familiar with — ubi societas ibi jus.\r\nAs indicated by the clear relationship between the\r\nLatin words jus and judicium —  which mean law and\r\nlegal action, respectively —  while law, in its initial\r\nstages, may be exclusively customary, its existence\r\nwithout some kind of legal system would be\r\ninconceivable.\r\nThat prompts us to touch on a concept that might\r\nseem obvious, but it is one that is so multifaceted that\r\nwe can learn from it. I am talking about the difference\r\nbetween international law and national legal systems.\r\nUnlike international law, the latter have at their\r\ndisposal not only legislators but legal bodies whose\r\njurisdiction individuals are subject to and whose\r\ndecisions are imposed by officials of the State, which\r\nhas a monopoly over the use of force at the domestic\r\nlevel. It is thus easy to understand that the man in the\r\nstreet — and even sometimes the legal professional —\r\nmight feel that international law either does not exist or\r\nis just a facade.\r\nIt seems that there must be a common set of\r\nprinciples that can be applied to relations between\r\nStates, and that these must at the very least include the\r\ninadmissibility of the arbitrary use of force by States,\r\nas well as the need for them to abide by their word.\r\nBut, given that at present no international law exists,\r\nnor can one exist, that, mutatis mutandis, has the\r\nattributes of national legal systems that I have just\r\noutlined, the man in the street tends towards scepticism\r\nas far as the effective existence of international law is\r\nconcerned, especially given the fact that he usually\r\nknows next to nothing about the many agreements that\r\nexist between States and that are fairly effective in\r\nregulating almost all aspects of international relations.\r\nThe existence of a corpus of international law is\r\nthe result not only of the existence, in the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations, of fundamental norms of\r\ncoexistence between States, the customary law that\r\nthey willingly respect and the agreements to which I\r\nalso referred, but also of a series of measures and\r\narrangements for overcoming disputes that are a kind\r\nof sub-product of international relations. Arbitration\r\nand judicial bodies stand out among such mechanisms\r\nas a means of resolving legal disputes between States,\r\ndiffering from each other only by virtue of the degree\r\nof permanence of their decisions — the judicial bodies\r\ngenerally being superior in this respect.\r\nOf all the international legal bodies in existence,\r\nwe must, of course, pay tribute to the one that is at the\r\ndisposal of all States and has general jurisdiction,\r\ncovering all legal provisions, whether mandatory or\r\nvoluntary, that govern inter-State relations. It is that\r\nbody — the doyen of international legal institutions —\r\nwhose annual report is before us today. That institution,\r\nconsidered not so much as a successor to its venerable\r\npredecessor, the Permanent Court of International\r\nJustice established in 1922, but as a body that has\r\ncontinued the work of that Court and has enriched the\r\nentire corpus of international law. That is because the\r\nCourt has been working not only to overcome disputes\r\nbetween States, but also to hand down decisions,\r\ninitially at the request of the League of Nations and,\r\nlater, of the United Nations and other international\r\nuniversal institutions, on legal, abstract or concrete\r\nquestions.\r\nWe are aware of the great increase in activity in\r\nevery aspect of the Court’s work over the past 12 years,\r\na fact that that remains the most notable characteristic\r\nof the institution. But its work is no less useful and\r\npraiseworthy. In addition to contributing to peace and\r\nharmony between States, its actions have led\r\nincreasingly to a reinforcement of the legal basis of\r\nmutual relations and helped to bolster international\r\ncooperation. That is why we should spare no efforts to\r\nensure that the Court, whose activities are very positive\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nfrom the perspective of a cost-benefit analysis, has the\r\nnecessary resources to achieve its full potential and,\r\nthanks to its outstanding work, continues to enjoy the\r\nconfidence of all States.\r\nMr. Shin Kak-soo (Republic of Korea): Allow\r\nme at the outset, on behalf of our delegation, to express\r\nour appreciation to Judge Gilbert Guillaume, President\r\nof the International Court of Justice, for his\r\nintroductory statement on the report of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. As always, his\r\ncomments are indeed thought-provoking.\r\nAt the same time, I wish to commend all the\r\nmembers of the Court and the staff of the Registry for\r\ntheir tireless efforts and deep commitment to the\r\npromotion of the rule of law in relations among States.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate Judge Shi Jiuyong, Judge Koroma,\r\nAmbassador Owada, Ambassador Tomka and Professor\r\nSimma on their recent election to that eminent judicial\r\nbody. My delegation is confident that they will prove\r\nthemselves to be invaluable assets to the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nMy delegation notes from the Court’s report the\r\nremarkable increase in the number of cases relating to\r\narmed conflict, as well as to land and maritime\r\nboundary delimitation, on the Court’s docket. These\r\nissues are usually political sensitive; they can strain\r\notherwise friendly relations among States and easily\r\nbecome real threats to the peace. In this context, my\r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nCourt, as the principal judicial organ of this\r\nOrganization, for its valuable contribution to the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation cannot fail to\r\nrecognize that the Court has been instrumental in the\r\ndevelopment of international law by rendering\r\njudgment on contentious cases and issuing advisory\r\nopinions. The jurisprudence of the Court is regarded as\r\nan authoritative statement of the current state of\r\ninternational law and, at the same time, an inspiration\r\nfor the progressive development of international law.\r\nDuring the period under review, the Court\r\nreaffirmed and clarified customary international law\r\nwith regard to the immunities of an incumbent Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs in the Arrest Warrant case of the 11\r\nApril 2000. The Court found in its Judgment that\r\nincumbent Ministers for Foreign Affairs enjoy full\r\nimmunity from criminal jurisdiction and inviolability\r\nabroad, and that the immunities accorded to them are\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nnot granted for their personal benefit, but rather to\r\nensure the effective performance of their functions on\r\nbehalf of their respective States.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Court’s findings in\r\nthat case and would like to briefly mention the\r\nrelationship between the rules on immunity and those\r\non international accountability with respect to war\r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. As the Court\r\nstated, immunity does not lead to impunity for\r\nincumbent Foreign Ministers. An incumbent Foreign\r\nMinister can always be prosecuted in his or her own\r\ncountry or in other States if the State that he or she\r\nrepresents waives its immunity. However, as Judge Van\r\nden Wyngaert pointed out in his dissenting opinion, in\r\ncases where national authorities are not willing or able\r\nto investigate or prosecute the crime goes unpunished.\r\nIn this connection, my delegation wishes to highlight\r\nthe role that the International Criminal Court can play\r\nin such circumstances, since article 27 of the Rome\r\nStatute has laid down the irrelevance of official\r\ncapacity.\r\nMy delegation notes with appreciation that the\r\nCourt has made further efforts to improve its working\r\nmethods and to accelerate its procedures. Those\r\nmeasures are part of a series of endeavours undertaken\r\nsince 1997 to rationalize the work of the Court. We are\r\nonly too well aware of the budgetary difficulties and\r\nthe extremely heavy workload facing the Court. The\r\nCourt increasingly finds itself unable to fulfil its\r\nmandate properly using its existing resources, whereas\r\nthe rapid expansion of the Court’s docket represents a\r\npositive indication of its prestige and authority. We\r\ncannot expect that the situation will be remedied by the\r\nCourt’s administrative efforts alone.\r\nThe international community is at a crucial\r\njuncture in its search for a better way to respond to the\r\nchanging international environment. The International\r\nCourt of Justice is now called upon to play a more\r\nactive role than ever before in ensuring respect for\r\ninternational law and in the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes between States. It is my delegation’s firm\r\nbelief that the Court deserves the full support of the\r\ninternational community and that it should be endowed\r\nwith the necessary means to discharge its functions and\r\nobligations to the fullest measure.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nreaffirm its full support for and confidence in the\r\ninvaluable work of the International Court of Justice in\r\nthe promotion of the rule of law and world peace in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on agenda item 13.\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.37\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General\r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda item\r\n13?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.15 p.m.\r\n"
