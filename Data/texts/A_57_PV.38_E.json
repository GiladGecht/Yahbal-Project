(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 52\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/387 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nSecretary-General to present his report, entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change”.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I am grateful for this\r\nopportunity to present my report, “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”.\r\nAs this Assembly well knows, one of my chief\r\naims ever since I became Secretary-General has been to\r\nmake the United Nations more useful to its Member\r\nStates and to the peoples of the world by making it\r\nmore effective and efficient. I have consistently said\r\nthat, in order to do this, we must be prepared to change\r\nwith the times, constantly adjusting to new conditions\r\nand new needs.\r\nThat was the object of the reform report that I\r\nintroduced in my first year and of other initiatives I\r\nhave taken since then. It is equally the aim of this new\r\nreport. The report sets out a package of very pragmatic\r\nimprovements. It builds on all that we have achieved\r\ntogether in the past five years. And it is guided by what\r\nthe Member States have decided should be the\r\nOrganization’s priorities.\r\nI am proposing a thorough review of our\r\nprogramme of work to make sure we are concentrating\r\nour efforts on what matters to Member States and to the\r\npeoples of the world. The Millennium Declaration,\r\nalong with the outcomes of the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development, the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development and other major\r\nconferences of the past decade, have outlined a\r\ncomprehensive vision of what Member States seek to\r\naccomplish. We must now ensure that our programme\r\nof work is adjusted and aligned to support this\r\nambitious agenda — especially the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and other imperatives in the\r\neconomic and social areas. Our goals will not be met\r\nunless we put all our efforts behind them.\r\nIn response to specific requests made by this\r\nAssembly, the report contains a number of proposals\r\nfor improving our performance in the areas of human\r\nrights and public information. Some have suggested\r\nthat the attention given to these two areas implies a\r\ndowngrading of the priority given to development.\r\nNothing could be further from the truth. We have\r\nlooked at human rights and public information in\r\nresponse to Members’ specific requests and the report\r\nis driven by our overriding ambition and mission to\r\nmeet the development goals set for the world’s people.\r\nAlso, in response to the Assembly’s request, the\r\nreport identifies major improvements in the planning\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nand servicing of meetings, including a more integrated\r\napproach and greater use of information technology.\r\nI have put forward a variety of ideas for\r\nimproving the reports that the Secretariat prepares.\r\nThis is not simply a question of reducing the number\r\nand length of reports, although that certainly is\r\nnecessary. It is also a question of strengthening their\r\nquality to permit a more comprehensive and holistic\r\nconsideration of complex, interconnected issues with\r\nwhich we must grapple. This is particularly relevant for\r\nthe consideration of economic and social issues. The\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and\r\nsubsidiary organs need high-quality analysis based on\r\nrigorous research and thematic coherence. Better\r\nreporting will help enhance the Organization’s\r\ndevelopment voice and strengthen the role of the\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council in\r\nleading the international agenda in this area.\r\nThe report also identifies further steps required to\r\nreinforce coordination among United Nations entities,\r\nparticularly in the delivery of programmes at the\r\ncountry level. We are all better off when the United\r\nNations works well as a team.\r\nThe report proposes some important changes in\r\nour budget and planning system. At the moment, we\r\nhave three different processes covering different time\r\nscales, and there are three different oversight review\r\nmechanisms. This is unnecessarily complex and\r\nlabour-intensive, and makes it nearly impossible for the\r\nvast majority of Member States to participate\r\nmeaningfully in the deliberations of this Assembly.\r\nI am establishing a high-level panel to take stock\r\nof the relationship between the United Nations and\r\ncivil society. The intensity of this interaction has grown\r\ntremendously in the past 15 years or so. Much good has\r\ncome from these contacts. At the same time, some real\r\nchallenges have come to the fore, and we can all sense\r\nthat it may well be time to look closely at what is\r\nworking well and what is not. The panel will be\r\ncomposed of people from different backgrounds —\r\nGovernments, non-governmental organizations,\r\nresearch institutions, parliaments and so on — as well\r\nas from different regions of the world, and will suggest\r\nways to enhance this crucial relationship.\r\nFinally, the report contains proposals aimed at\r\nmaking life better and more rewarding for our staff, as\r\nwell as further improving their quality and\r\nperformance, notably by making it easier for them to\r\nmove between locations, between functions and\r\nbetween organizations.\r\nThis report provides broad direction for the\r\nfuture. It sets goals and provides an indication of how\r\nto reach those goals. The whole package hangs together\r\nas a coherent whole, and I urge the Assembly to treat it\r\nas such. What I need to know now is whether the\r\nAssembly agrees with the broad direction. I hope we\r\ncan all agree that the programme of work needs to be\r\nupdated; that reports can better serve the membership’s\r\ndifficult policy-making decisions; and that the system\r\nof planning and budgeting needs to be simplified. And\r\nI hope that once the Assembly debates the report in\r\nplenary meeting, it will adopt a single resolution giving\r\nme clear guidance on the way forward.\r\nMy proposals may seem modest, taken\r\nindividually. But taken together, they amount to a new\r\nway of doing business. Most important, they are\r\nachievable steps, with real potential to make the United\r\nNations a more effective instrument in pursuit of the\r\npriorities of its Members.\r\nIn closing, let me stress that as we move ahead, I\r\nwould want there to be an open process, with real\r\ndialogue between Member States and the Secretariat,\r\nbased on mutual trust and confidence. That is the only\r\nway for our Organization to meet the diverse and many\r\ndemands placed on it. Let us, then, in the words of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, “spare no effort to make the\r\nUnited Nations a more effective instrument”\r\n(resolution 55/2, para. 29).\r\nThe President: First of all, let me thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his introductory statement, in\r\nwhich he touched upon the essential aspects of his\r\nreform proposal, contained in the document entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387). I particularly welcome the\r\nfact that the Secretary-General clearly dispelled any\r\nanxiety that reform could lead to the curtailment of the\r\ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations.\r\nToday, we have the report before us for\r\nconsideration. In my view, the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is very good, comprehensive, timely and\r\nextremely useful. It was initiated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and resulted from a thorough review of the\r\nwork of the Secretariat, its mandates and its\r\nprogrammes. The report has been widely welcomed by\r\nthe membership and deserves great credit.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nWe all know that the United Nations has already\r\nundergone changes in recent years. Its performance has\r\nimproved, and it is now able to respond better to a wide\r\nrange of new challenges. But the United Nations\r\nreform of 1997 has not yet been fully completed. The\r\nUnited Nations still has many areas that need to be\r\nrationalized with a view to refining its functioning.\r\nUnited Nations reform is a continuing process,\r\nand, therefore, I see the report as a stepping stone\r\ntowards further improvements in the work of both the\r\nSecretariat and the General Assembly. That is why\r\nmany of the Secretary-General’s proposals could bring\r\nfresh ideas into the process of revitalization of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly, which our presidency\r\nfully supports.\r\nThe initial informal response to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals has been very positive. The report\r\nsuggests a number of diverse improvements and\r\ninnovative changes that would make the work of the\r\nUnited Nations more productive and efficient. I see the\r\nreport as an important stimulus, to which we, the\r\nMember States, should react in a constructive way.\r\nUnited Nations reform is not and cannot be perceived\r\nas a unilateral action. It is a process in which the joint\r\neffort of the membership and the Secretariat is\r\nabsolutely crucial for getting the second phase of\r\nreforms started and agreed actions implemented.\r\nAs members all know, the report was issued more\r\nthan a month ago, and subsequently many regional\r\nbriefings and one session of informal consultations\r\nhave been held in order to provide additional\r\ninformation. Given the complexity of the issues, it is\r\nnot surprising that many proposed actions still require\r\nfurther clarification. On the basis of consultations with\r\na number of Member States, I have suggested that the\r\nSecretariat prepare a conference room paper that would\r\nprovide written answers and explanations on all major\r\nissues raised by various groups or individual Member\r\nStates, as well as on questions that I expect to arise\r\nduring these important plenary meetings. We have\r\nagreed with the Secretary-General that such a paper\r\nwill be prepared as a one-off exercise soon after this\r\ndebate, so that it can be taken into account during the\r\nfirst round of the informal consultations. We believe\r\nthat this approach will accommodate delegations’\r\nconcerns and create an atmosphere of trust for further\r\ndeliberations.\r\nI recognize that what the Secretary-General has\r\nmapped out is an ongoing process. There are some\r\nactions within the purview of the Secretary-General for\r\nimmediate implementation, and there are other actions\r\nthat might need additional reports and/or further\r\nconsideration by the relevant Committees next year.\r\nMany of the proposed actions call for measures to be\r\ntaken by the Secretary-General with the endorsement\r\nand/or guidance of Member States. Our deliberations\r\nshould result in formulating general directions for\r\nachieving agreed actions.\r\nLet me now briefly inform Members how I intend\r\nto handle the process that will lead to the adoption of\r\nthe resolution mentioned by the Secretary-General. Let\r\nme stress that this is going to be an open and very\r\ntransparent process, in which all interested and\r\nconcerned delegations will be involved. After this\r\nplenary debate, I will launch open-ended informal\r\nconsultations as soon as possible, preferably on Friday\r\nmorning, 1 November. I have already asked one Vice-\r\nPresident of the General Committee to help me lead the\r\nprocess and chair the informal consultations in my\r\nabsence. I have also approached a number of\r\nAmbassadors with a request to assist the Vice-President\r\nand me in facilitating the process, and I shall announce\r\ntheir names before the end of the debate on this item.\r\nI will carefully listen to the views, proposals and\r\nconcerns of Members both at this plenary and during\r\nthe informal consultations. After the debate and after\r\nthe first round of the informal consultations, during\r\nwhich further clarification will be provided by the\r\nSecretariat, I will introduce the draft resolution, in\r\nwhich I will reflect those views. I hope that I can count\r\non the constructive and active support of Members. I\r\nbelieve that, given good political will, the dedicated\r\ntime and energy of concerned delegations and a bit of\r\nluck, we will have a workable, endorsed resolution\r\nbefore Christmas.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of South\r\nAfrica, who will speak on behalf of the Movement of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Countries and the African Union.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): Allow me to recall\r\nthese noble words:\r\n“We will spare no effort to make the United\r\nNations a more effective instrument for pursuing\r\nall of these priorities: the fight for development\r\nfor all the peoples of the world; the fight against\r\npoverty, ignorance and disease; the fight against\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\ninjustice; the fight against violence, terror and\r\ncrime; and the fight against the degradation and\r\ndestruction of our common home.” (A/RES/55/2,\r\npara. 29)\r\nThat is a quotation from the Millennium Declaration,\r\nendorsed by more than 160 heads of State or\r\nGovernment, who attended the Millennium Summit\r\nheld in New York in September, 2000.\r\nThe Secretary-General has presented us with\r\nreport the entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change”. The emphasis\r\non this being an agenda for further change is indeed\r\ndeliberate and very necessary. We wish to state from\r\nthe outset that we welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. We support his efforts to strengthen our\r\nOrganization, and believe that a strong and effective\r\nUnited Nations can play a pivotal role in carrying out\r\nthe core Charter mission which was reaffirmed in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nYou, Sir, have invited Member States to engage in\r\nthe strategic dialogue on strengthening this\r\nOrganization. My delegation accepts your challenge\r\nand remains ready to assist you in any manner we can.\r\nWe are troubled, however, by the suspicions and fears\r\nthat the reform process seems to have provoked.\r\nTherefore, we resist the temptation to engage in\r\ndetailed questioning of the intentions of our joint\r\nefforts. Instead, we choose to trust that the invitation\r\nfor us to become part of an agenda for further change is\r\nin recognition of our joint responsibility to try to\r\nachieve the best for the good and welfare of our\r\nbeloved United Nations.\r\nIn Africa we have come to recognize that there\r\nare dynamic linkages between development in our\r\ncontinent and the agenda of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. The establishment of the African Union and\r\nthe adoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is an acknowledgement by\r\nAfrica that we need new institutions that are equipped\r\nto deal with the challenges of the new millennium. In\r\nour contribution to streamlining the African agenda in\r\nthe General Assembly, we have already decided to\r\ncluster the three items on development in Africa.\r\nAlready, the development issues on Africa — the\r\ncauses of conflict and the promotion of durable peace\r\nand sustainable development in Africa, the final review\r\nand appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and the\r\nimplementation of the Second Industrial Decade for\r\nAfrica — were addressed in a joint debate in this\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe intend to take this process of streamlining\r\nAfrican agenda items even further. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral makes good proposals to improve the\r\nefficiency and the effectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nThey should be guided by decisions contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, the Durban Declaration, as\r\nwell as the outcomes of the Monterrey International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. The mandates of those Conferences form\r\nthe basis of the task this Assembly must carry out\r\ncollectively. A clearly spelled out follow-up\r\nmechanism and a revised programme budget should\r\nintegrate the follow-up processes. However, reform is\r\nan ongoing process, and should not become an end in\r\nitself.\r\nWe note, for example, that the Second Committee\r\nis engaged in intensive discussion on reforms,\r\nincluding considering the possibility of plastering\r\nmacroeconomic issues on the agenda. We hope that\r\nwill continue in a holistic and comprehensive manner\r\nand will inspire other Committees to do the same. That\r\nwill avoid creating an impression that reform is limited\r\nto issues of development that are important to those of\r\nus from the developing world. We look forward to the\r\nimplementation plan of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group by September 2003, aimed at\r\nstrengthening the effectiveness of the Organization’s\r\npresence in developing countries. We recognize the\r\nimportance of joint programming at the country level,\r\npooling of resources, common databases and\r\nknowledge networks, dedicated support for the\r\nResident Coordinator and integrated planning,\r\nbudgeting and resource mobilization tools for countries\r\nemerging from conflict. However, we believe that all\r\ndeveloping countries can benefit from this reform; it\r\nshould not be limited to those countries that are\r\nemerging from conflict. While the proposed actions can\r\ncontribute to strengthening the effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations at field level, the critical element of\r\ncore resources must also be addressed. We would like\r\nto see included in this action proposed methods for the\r\nmobilization of additional resources for the United\r\nNations. Additional, predictable resources help drive\r\ndevelopment in Africa. The current trend is towards a\r\ndiminishing of core resources for the United Nations,\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nand Africa bears the brunt of the resultant cutbacks in\r\nUnited Nations activities.\r\nThe creation of an additional position of Assistant\r\nSecretary-General is welcome, especially if a purpose\r\nof this post is to support policy coherence as\r\nemphasized in the Monterrey Consensus. Such a person\r\nwill also be valuable in monitoring the implementation\r\nand follow-up efforts to the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, held at Johannesburg. It will\r\nbe important for the post incumbent to interact with\r\ninstitutional and other stakeholders such as the World\r\nBank, the International Monetary Fund and the World\r\nTrade Organization. When the post is filled, we assume\r\nthat the issue of equitable geographical representation\r\nwill be kept in mind.\r\nThe appointment of an Adviser for Special\r\nAssignments in Africa was of particular interest to\r\nAfricans. It is important for that official to have access\r\nto the Secretary-General, since his Office is to be\r\nentrusted with an already agreed special mandate on\r\nAfrica which, as described in the report, is open to\r\ndifferent interpretations. We believe that the Office\r\nshould have a particular mandate on NEPAD, and we\r\nurge the Secretary-General to continue to review it.\r\nThe Assembly recently adopted resolution 57/2 on\r\nNEPAD. In that connection, the Office of the Adviser\r\nmust review and report on United Nations system and\r\nother international support for NEPAD and on the\r\ncoordination and implementation of summit and\r\nconference outcomes as they pertain to Africa.\r\nWe welcome the aim of supporting human rights\r\nat the country level, rationalizing and streamlining the\r\nwork of the human rights treaty bodies, improving the\r\nworking methods of the system of special procedures,\r\nand streamlining management and improving the\r\nfinancial situation of the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. We look\r\nforward to the engagement of Member States in future\r\nplans, including the expanding of the mandates of\r\nResident Representatives.\r\nRegarding the budget, my delegation supports\r\nand is ready to engage in all efforts aimed at improving\r\nthe effectiveness of the United Nations, as well as\r\nstreamlining the budgetary and administrative activities\r\nof the Organization. These include giving the\r\nSecretary-General flexibility to deploy resources\r\nbetween sub-programmes to meet the challenges our\r\nOrganization may face. We look forward to the General\r\nAssembly receiving the revised programme budget in\r\n2003 and believe that it should reflect the priorities\r\ncontained in the medium-term plan and other\r\nlegislative mandates, incorporating the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWe urge the Secretary-General to present an\r\nimproved planning and budgeting system and to\r\nprovide a more detailed proposal on the benefits and\r\nimplications of the shorter medium-term plan as well\r\nas on the accountability and monitoring measures. We\r\nreaffirms the role of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination in the planning and programmatic aspects\r\nof the budget cycle, and request that we jointly\r\ncontinue to look into measures to improve the working\r\nmethods of the Committee.\r\nThere is probably no delegation that would not be\r\nproud to have its citizens serving as international civil\r\nservants in this Organization. Therefore, we urge the\r\nSecretary-General to take any steps that will improve\r\nthe working conditions of Secretariat employees. We\r\nwant our international servants to be proud to serve the\r\nUnited Nations, and this can be only if we ourselves\r\nfeel proud to be part of a strengthened Organization.\r\nMr. Vallenilla (Venezuela): On behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China, I express our appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for the presentation of his report\r\non the strengthening of the United Nations (A/57/387).\r\nAt the outset, allow me to say that the Group wants to\r\nconvey to him its full support for the intentions\r\noutlined in the report:\r\n“The present report suggests a number of\r\nimprovements aimed at ensuring that the\r\nOrganization devotes its attention to the priorities\r\nfixed by the Member States, and that the\r\nSecretariat gives better service”. (A/57/387, p. 2)\r\nThat is a very clear statement, and is in line with our\r\nconcerns for more efficient work from this universal\r\ninstitution. We must clarify that our remarks are\r\nbasically related to the economic and social,\r\ninformation and budgetary issues on which the Group\r\ntakes a position.\r\nWe are prepared to engage in any action oriented\r\ntowards those high aims. Our framework in that regard\r\nwill be defined by two considerations: First, none of\r\nthe actions for change must have a negative effect on\r\nthe capacity of developing countries to negotiate. That\r\nis particularly important with regard to the provision of\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nservices for meetings of the Group and in relation to\r\npublications supplying important elements for the\r\ndecision-making of developing countries. The second\r\nconsideration is that none of these actions should limit\r\nthe capacity of the Secretariat to deliver its full\r\npotential contribution to the development of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General presents a\r\ncomprehensive set of ideas, based on what has been\r\nachieved since 1997 in strengthening this strong world\r\nbody. In today’s globalizing world, we can truly expect\r\nthat the wishes and priorities of Member States, as well\r\nas the aspirations of civil society to a fully efficient\r\nOrganization, will be pursued.\r\nThe report deserves comprehensive and holistic\r\nconsideration by Member States in order to ensure a\r\ntransparent and fully participatory approach to the\r\nreform of the Organization. As the Secretary-General\r\nmay be aware, the Group has made a thorough reading\r\nof his proposals. As a consequence, we have found a\r\nnumber of issues on which we would like further\r\nclarification in order to assess the implications of the\r\nrelated actions. To that end, we formulated a series of\r\nquestions and presented them to the Secretariat on the\r\noccasion of the informal consultations convened by\r\nyou, Mr. President. These underline the keen interest of\r\nthe Group in grasping the scope of the proposed\r\nreforms. Having our questions answered is\r\nindispensable if we are to make a just and proper\r\nevaluation of these outstanding issues. We are pleased\r\nto know that a document is being prepared in that\r\nregard, as just announced.\r\nThe reform process must strengthen the ability of\r\nthe United Nations to fulfil its role and functions in the\r\ndevelopment field, with the General Assembly\r\nproviding the leadership to ensure the fulfilment of the\r\nsocial and economic goals enunciated in the Charter.\r\nMany challenges remain for developing countries. As a\r\nresult of the dynamics of global change, those\r\nchallenges present themselves in a new domestic and\r\ninternational framework.\r\nThe process should be carried out with the\r\nprimary goal of strengthening the capacity of the\r\nOrganization to address development issues and to\r\nrespond effectively to the development needs and\r\npriorities of developing countries. Reform proposals\r\nand measures must be fully consistent with the\r\nmedium-term plan, which constitutes the principal\r\npolicy directive of the Organization. The main\r\nobjective of the reform measures and proposals should\r\nbe to enable the United Nations to implement fully all\r\nmandated programmes and activities. This is not a\r\nmatter of downsizing or an effort to achieve savings.\r\nThe developmental tasks of the United Nations are of\r\nfundamental importance and may not be treated as\r\nsecondary to other functions.\r\nThe financial implications of any reform\r\nproposals on which the General Assembly shall take\r\naction should be assessed carefully. Any proposal for\r\nchange in the financial and staff rules and regulations\r\nrequired as a result of the implementation of reform\r\nmeasures and proposals should be submitted to the\r\nAssembly for its consideration and approval.\r\nOnce again, the Group of 77 and China would\r\nlike to stress its full support for the need to reform our\r\nOrganization. In that spirit, we would like to reiterate\r\nour positive and constructive approach to engage in\r\nfurther consultations on this issue.\r\nAt the beginning of this century, at the\r\nMillennium Assembly, Member States “decided to\r\nmake the United Nations a more effective instrument\r\nfor pursuing the priorities adopted in the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration” (A/57/387,\r\nsummary). Now, two years later, we have gone through\r\nvery important political processes in the economic and\r\nsocial fields. In addition, a number of very important\r\ncommitments have been made in the Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, the Conference on Ageing\r\nand at the special General Assembly session on\r\nchildren, among others. We have created a network of\r\ncommitments. The Organization has to respond to the\r\nchallenges posed by the full implementation of those\r\ncommitments. The world has gone through enormous\r\npolitical changes in the last decade. The United\r\nNations must finally tackle its own restructuring in\r\norder to respond to the demands of the new times.\r\nMs. Løj (Denmark): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The countries of\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the Associated countries\r\nof Cyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Association country of the European\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nEconomic Area, Iceland, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nThe European Union would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his initiatives to further\r\nstrengthen the Organization. Under his leadership, we\r\nhave come a long way towards modernizing the United\r\nNations. The European Union fully supports the\r\nprocess set in motion by the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nTogether we have improved United Nations\r\neffectiveness and stature, both here in New York and in\r\nthe field.\r\nIf the United Nations is to be able to meet the\r\ncontinuing new challenges of this millennium, there is\r\nmuch more to do. Above all, consensus around the\r\ndevelopment agenda must become a reality. That\r\ndevelopment agenda took significant steps forward as a\r\nresult of the adoption of the Millennium Declaration,\r\nthe decisions taken in Rome, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg and the increased focus on the African\r\ncontinent enshrined in the membership’s unanimous\r\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment.\r\nWe welcome the attention that these issues,\r\namong others, have received in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. That shows that strengthening the Organization\r\nis not an abstract activity pursued for its own purposes,\r\nbut that this exercise provides the means to change the\r\nlives and well-being of the world’s poor. It underlines\r\nthe fact that the ultimate aim of our work in the United\r\nNations is to make the world a better place for the poor\r\npeople of this planet.\r\nTwo years ago, heads of State and Government\r\nset the goals and priorities of the Organization. Having\r\nadopted the blueprint, now is the time to ensure that the\r\nOrganization is well equipped to implement these goals\r\nand priorities. The agenda we have before us, and the\r\nspecific actions contained in it, constitute an invitation\r\nby the Secretary-General to Member States to\r\nstrengthen the implementation capacity of the\r\nOrganization. In that way, the United Nations can\r\nbetter assist Member States in implementing the\r\nMillennium Declaration and other crucial mandates of\r\nthe Organization, including the follow-up to the\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg summits. The European\r\nUnion would like to accept that invitation, and move\r\nswiftly to the hard work that will commence once this\r\nreport has been endorsed by the General Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposed actions focus\r\non implementation. They are practical and down-to-\r\nearth. They should, within the coming years, produce\r\nsubstantial improvements in the Organization. A\r\nclearer sense of the Organization’s priorities means\r\nbetter and more efficient resource allocation, not\r\nbudget cuts. The Secretary-General should do some\r\nthings right away. Others have to be endorsed by us,\r\nthe Member States, while still others will have to be\r\ndiscussed further by the General Assembly in the years\r\nto come, based upon, inter alia, further reports or in\r\nconnection with next year’s proposed budget for the\r\n2004-2005 biennium. This process will generate\r\ntangible advantages for the entire United Nations\r\nmembership, as well as for the Secretariat and its\r\nvaluable staff, in terms of improved programme quality\r\nand delivery, transparency, accountability and value for\r\nmoney.\r\nLet me give a few examples of where the\r\nEuropean Union believes that the Member States and\r\nthe Secretary-General, working together in a spirit of\r\npartnership, can deliver those tangible benefits.\r\nThe Secretary-General proposes to review some\r\nspecific programme activities so as to improve the\r\nwork of the United Nations — for instance, on\r\nimportant issues such as human rights and information\r\nand in the economic and social area. The European\r\nUnion would like to stress the importance it attaches to\r\nstrengthening the economic and social areas of activity\r\nin the United Nations, in particular in relation to\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe world community has signed on to a new\r\npartnership for development, based on the Monterrey\r\nConsensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation. In order for us to realize the\r\ncommitments of the Millennium Summit and the\r\nresults of major United Nations conferences, and to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, thereby\r\nlifting more people out of poverty, implementation\r\nthrough this partnership for development has to be\r\nsuccessful.\r\nWe attach special importance to giving high\r\npriority to Africa in the work of the United Nations.\r\nThe birth of the African Union, the consolidation of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development and the\r\nrecent positive prospects of ending some of Africa’s\r\nprotracted conflicts — in Angola, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Sierra\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nLeone, Sudan and Somalia — are notable political\r\ndevelopments that call for continued, strong and\r\nfocused cooperation between the United Nations\r\nsystem and Member States.\r\nWe see the proposed strengthening of the\r\neconomic and social areas of activity in the United\r\nNations against this overall background.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that the\r\nOrganization’s presence in developing countries must\r\nbe strengthened by improving its effectiveness. We\r\nwelcome the proposal that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group should draw up an implementation\r\nplan to that effect. We also welcome the steps towards\r\nclarifying the roles and responsibilities in the area of\r\ntechnical cooperation.\r\nThe managerial capabilities of the Department of\r\nEconomic and Social Affairs must be strengthened,\r\ngiven the burden it carries. There is a need for a clearer\r\ndefinition of responsibilities, including a better\r\ndivision of labour between Headquarters and the\r\nUnited Nations field stations, as well as improved\r\ncoordination between Headquarters and regional levels,\r\nincluding regional commissions. We support the\r\nstrengthening of the role of the Adviser for Special\r\nAssignments as a means of sustaining the\r\nOrganization’s stronger policy focus on Africa.\r\nIn this regard, we also emphasize the need to\r\nconsolidate and strengthen cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions.\r\nThe European Union remains supportive of\r\ninvolving civil society and the private sector in the\r\nwork of the Organization. We look forward to the\r\nrecommendations on improving modalities for United\r\nNations interaction with civil society.\r\nOn human rights, the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral identify the key areas where activities need to\r\nbe reviewed and possibly strengthened. This is an area\r\nof work on which the European Union has always\r\nplaced a high priority. And it is a matter of importance\r\nand concern for the General Assembly as a whole.\r\nThere must be, therefore, the necessary degree of\r\nconsultation with the relevant inter-governmental\r\nbodies in the implementation of the proposed changes.\r\nThe proposals for further improvement of United\r\nNations information work are also very important.\r\nStrengthening the Organization in this field is crucial\r\nfor securing continued popular support for the United\r\nNations as the world’s primary inter-governmental\r\norganization. Information work is constantly changing,\r\ndriven by technological advance. That in turn requires\r\na constant process of appraisal to make sure that the\r\nUnited Nations is reaching its target audiences and\r\ngetting its message across with the most effective\r\nmeans possible. Reviewing the role of the United\r\nNations Information Centres should be seen in that\r\ncontext and deserves serious consideration. The\r\nEuropean Union stands ready in principle to take up the\r\nchallenge in the Secretary-General’s proposal aimed at\r\nmaking the information work in Europe more efficient,\r\nand looks forward to participating in discussions about\r\nits practical implementation, taking into account\r\nregional needs.\r\nThe budget cycle of the United Nations clearly\r\nneeds modernization, so it can better serve a modern\r\nand efficient Organization such as the United Nations.\r\nThe important first step is a more transparent and\r\nstrategic budget document which clearly sets out the\r\nOrganization’s priorities and consequent resource\r\nrequirements.\r\nTherefore, the measures proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General on how best to present the budget to\r\nus — such as presentation of our priorities, briefer and\r\nmore strategic documentation, fewer and more focused\r\nmeetings and strengthening of the oversight and\r\nevaluation services — are very helpful.\r\nWe agree that the programme budget for the\r\nbiennium 2004-2005, which will be submitted to us in\r\n2003, should be thoroughly revised, so that it better\r\nreflects the priorities agreed to at the Millennium\r\nAssembly. Obviously, this must be done within the\r\noverall framework of the medium-term plan.\r\nSimilarly, our daily work will become more\r\ntransparent and focused when we have streamlined the\r\njungle of reports and meetings. Documents that are on\r\ntime and more to the point and better management of\r\nthe General Assembly and Conference Services means\r\ngreater efficiency. And this will give better\r\nopportunities for all to play a more significant role in\r\nour work.\r\nWe support the continuing improvement of\r\nhuman resources management in the coming years. An\r\nOrganization’s most valuable asset is its staff, and an\r\nagenda for streamlining the United Nations must also\r\naddress the need to continue to enhance the\r\ncompetence of United Nations personnel.\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nIt is also crucial that Member States shoulder\r\ntheir responsibilities and find ways to streamline the\r\ninter-governmental process. Important work has\r\nalready begun on ways to revitalize the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWe have noted that the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposed actions regarding the budget generally build\r\non the framework already established by the General\r\nAssembly, for the budget cycle in general, for the\r\nintroduction of results-based budgeting and for the\r\nFinancial Rules and Regulations. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations membership should endorse this road\r\nmap for streamlining the implementation of these\r\nexisting mandates. We recognize that concerns among\r\nthe membership have to be addressed. In our view, we\r\nshould allow ourselves sufficient time to deal with\r\nthose concerns. But we should also, at this session of\r\nthe General Assembly, agree on the goal to be\r\nachieved — a more transparent, results-oriented and\r\nstrategic budget for our Organization.\r\nIn response to the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nMember States must now show the leadership needed\r\nand give a renewed mandate to the Secretary-General\r\nin order to strengthen the Organization. We must\r\nformulate our joint vision of new and more modern\r\nways of doing business in the United Nations and ask\r\nthe Secretary-General to start implementation.\r\nAt the same time, we must all be aware that the\r\nproposed measures cannot be implemented\r\nautomatically or overnight. We the Member States will\r\ncome back to these issues, in close dialogue with the\r\nSecretary-General, as part of the regular inter-\r\ngovernmental consultation, once the detailed\r\nimplementation gets under way.\r\nAchieving that calls for deliberations at a high\r\nlevel. Permanent Representatives, the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Secretary-General and the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General have an important task to\r\nperform in the coming days and weeks.\r\nWe all look to you, Mr. President, to lead us\r\ntowards taking this first important step over the next\r\nfew weeks. Please be reassured of the full cooperation\r\nof the United Nations to that end.\r\nMr. Naidu (Fiji): It is an honour to address the\r\nAssembly on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum\r\nGroup in New York: Australia, the Marshall Islands,\r\nFederated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand,\r\nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands,\r\nTonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, as well as my own country,\r\nFiji.\r\nMay I begin by offering our sincere gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General for submitting this report\r\n(A/57/387) to the Assembly. Under his exemplary\r\nleadership, the United Nations has already taken\r\nimportant steps towards strengthening the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe report before us constitutes a serious\r\nprogramme for continuing reform, stretching across\r\nnumerous areas of United Nations activity. During\r\ndiscussion of the Secretary-General’s reform initiative\r\nduring his first term, much was made of the idea that\r\nreform was not an event but a process. Indeed, reform\r\nhas been one of the hallmarks of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s tenure. This report contains further practical\r\nproposals for improving the United Nations work.\r\nMore importantly, it also promises systemic reform\r\nwhich would make the Organization more flexible and\r\nresponsive in meeting the priorities of Member States.\r\nImproving the way in which the United Nations\r\noperates requires the membership and the Secretariat to\r\nmove jointly towards shared objectives. It will be\r\nnecessary for us to distinguish between proposals\r\nsolely within the Secretary-General’s purview and\r\nthose which require inter-governmental decision. But\r\nwe should not dwell on this too long. The more\r\nimportant point is that we should all be moving in the\r\nsame direction.\r\nFor our part, we think the direction indicated by\r\nthe Secretary-General is the right one. We believe that\r\nthe Assembly should endorse that direction and take\r\naction where it can now. While we need to delve into\r\ndetails to form judgement on some of the proposals, we\r\nshould keep our focus during this session on the\r\nstrategic direction the Secretary-General has proposed.\r\nA few weeks ago, in the plenary debate on the\r\nMillennium Declaration Goals and the work of the\r\nOrganization, many speakers expressed a desire to see\r\nthe United Nations move from setting objectives to a\r\nnew phase of implementing them. Without\r\nimplementation, the Millennium Declaration Goals and\r\nthe objectives set at Monterrey and Johannesburg could\r\nbecome hollow promises.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that there\r\nare areas in which the United Nations needs to do\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nmore. In particular, we agree that the United Nations\r\nneeds to take a more comprehensive look at migration\r\nissues, as proposed in paragraph 39 of the report, and\r\nto strengthen its capacities to combat terrorism, drug\r\ntrafficking and international crime.\r\nAction 1 of the Secretary-General’s report is,\r\ntherefore, very timely. The United Nations needs to be\r\nmore flexible in adapting what it does to what we want\r\nto achieve. At present, the Organization’s capacity to\r\nrespond to new priorities set by Member States is\r\nseriously constrained by the rigidity of the program\r\nbudget. It is only sensible that less relevant activities\r\ngive way to higher priorities over time. All of our\r\nGovernments do this. The existing budget rules already\r\nprovide for it to happen here. The time has certainly\r\narrived for the United Nations to begin to do likewise.\r\nI speak today on behalf of a group composed\r\nmostly of very small delegations. The avalanche of\r\ndocumentation, the tremendous number of meetings,\r\nthe long agendas of many committees, and the\r\nsprawling budget process reduce the capacity of small\r\ndelegations to affect the decisions in the General\r\nAssembly. And, not only do they diminish the\r\nAssembly’s democratic quality by effectively\r\ndisenfranchising small delegations, they also render the\r\nAssembly less effective than it ought to be.\r\nThere is clearly only so much the Secretariat can\r\ndo to improve the operation of the inter-governmental\r\nmachinery. In Actions 11 and 13, by which the\r\nDepartment of General Assembly Affairs and\r\nConference Management will play a more active role in\r\nmanaging documentation and meetings, the Secretariat\r\nis doing what it can. I spoke on behalf of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum on this topic in the Fifth Committee last\r\nweek.\r\nOur delegations believe that Member States\r\nshould do more on this front, both under the rubric of\r\nreform and within the ambit of the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAction 12, proposing that the Assembly establish\r\na review mechanism for reports, is worth developing.\r\nWe could start that at this session.\r\nWe should consider renewed efforts to streamline\r\nagendas and shorten meetings. Despite some changes,\r\nthe Assembly’s agenda remains overloaded with the\r\ndetritus of the past. Some judicious culling would make\r\nour work more manageable with little loss.\r\nAnd, Action 3, recommending that the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights should consult with\r\nthe human rights treaty bodies with the aim of\r\nstreamlining reporting procedures, should lead to\r\nimprovements in a vital, but unduly cumbersome, area\r\nof United Nations activity.\r\nWe look forward to discuss these ideas and others\r\nin our informal meetings.\r\nActions 21 and 22, which suggest principles for\r\nmodifying the budget process, warrant careful\r\nconsideration. The Secretary-General’s diagnosis of the\r\nmalaise in the budget process is compelling. The\r\nprocess takes far too long. There is too much wrangling\r\nover inconsequential issues. There is little capacity for\r\nMember States to provide strategic direction. And,\r\ndespite enormous expenditure of resources by Member\r\nStates and the Secretariat, the budget shows negligible\r\nchange from biennium to biennium. Further, the\r\ndisconnect between evaluation and planning remains\r\ntoo wide, inhibiting more responsive planning based on\r\nresults.\r\nIn short, the process disadvantages small States\r\nand serves the United Nations poorly. Given the\r\ncomplexity of the issues involved, it is unlikely that we\r\ncould agree on the specifics of a remedy during this\r\nsession. But, we should begin the discussion now and\r\nwe may be able to reach agreement on some principles\r\nas a first step.\r\nThe countries of the Pacific Islands Forum fully\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s continuing efforts to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations. We hope that other\r\ndelegations are also ready to move in the direction\r\noutlined by the Secretary-General. It is our belief that\r\njoint action by the membership and the Secretariat can\r\nproduce a more responsive United Nations and a more\r\nparticipative and productive General Assembly, which\r\nwill better serve the priorities of the Member States.\r\nMr. Mackay (New Zealand): I have the honour\r\ntoday to speak on behalf of the delegations of\r\nAustralia, Canada and New Zealand.\r\nOur delegations strongly support reform. We do\r\nso, not for the sake of change itself or because we\r\nequate change with savings. We support change\r\nbecause we believe this Organization must be\r\nstrengthened in order to meet Member States’\r\nexpectations. Change in the way the United Nations\r\ngoes about implementing its mandates is essential for\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nimproving not only its effectiveness, but also its\r\ncredibility and visibility.\r\nThe Secretary-General has mapped out a way\r\nforward for the Organization, focusing on some key\r\nmessages: doing what matters, serving Member States\r\nbetter, working together, allocating resources to\r\npriorities, and investing in excellence through United\r\nNations staff. We endorse the purpose of the report —\r\nto make the Organization more effective, modern and\r\noutcome-oriented.\r\nCollectively these changes will better equip the\r\nOrganization to meet our common aspirations for a\r\nmore peaceful, prosperous and just world. The\r\nMillennium Declaration is a valuable organizing\r\nconcept to help us focus on urgent and current\r\npriorities. Agreed at the highest level as a road map for\r\nour Organization, it addresses the full spectrum of\r\nUnited Nations activity, from peace and security, to\r\nhuman rights, to sustainable development. It articulates\r\nshared, ambitious and concrete development goals.\r\nThese reforms will therefore help the United Nations\r\nbetter to reflect the collective will of Member States.\r\nThe constraints on our ability to do so are clearly set\r\nout in the Secretary-General’s report — a cluttered\r\nagenda dominated by meetings and documents rather\r\nthan by results. The 36,000 outputs currently on the\r\nUnited Nations books make it harder for the United\r\nNations to respond to new demands. We therefore\r\nwelcome the intention of the Secretary-General to\r\npropose in the next budget the closest possible\r\nalignment of resources and activities with current\r\npriorities.\r\nAt the heart of the Secretary-General’s proposals\r\nis the need for a functioning and effective General\r\nAssembly. This is the only organ of the United Nations\r\nwhere we all have a voice.\r\nBut that voice is weakened by systemic\r\ninefficiency and by an overloaded agenda. The General\r\nAssembly must focus on key issues that require\r\ninternational action. As well as being the best use of\r\nresources, this would also make the workload more\r\ntargeted and manageable for small delegations. I can do\r\nno better in this respect than to refer to the eloquent\r\nand articulate comments of the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Fiji, who spoke just before me, in\r\nthis respect.\r\nSpecial conferences can play an important role,\r\nbut we should ensure that they do not take over the role\r\nof our Charter organs.\r\nThe measures suggested by the Secretary-General\r\noffer an opportunity for us all to strengthen our\r\nparticipation in the United Nations. The legislative role\r\nof the intergovernmental process is very important. We\r\nthink that a stronger and better-functioning Secretariat\r\nwill not dilute that role, but, on the contrary, will\r\nstrengthen it by enabling us better to exercise our\r\ndecision-making responsibility.\r\nWe also welcome the proposals relating to\r\nconference management and documentation. While this\r\nsection is entitled “Serving Member States better”, we\r\nsee it more as a collaborative exercise. We delegations\r\nneed to be more disciplined in our use of meeting time\r\nand in the organization of our work. Member States\r\nalso have a parallel obligation to reform the Assembly\r\nand other key organs. The delegations of Australia,\r\nCanada and New Zealand take this shared\r\nresponsibility seriously. We therefore support the\r\nSecretary-General’s suggestion that we consider a\r\nmechanism to look at recurring reporting requirements.\r\nOur delegations see a pressing need for reform of\r\nthe budget and planning machinery. The Organization’s\r\nrecent introduction of results-based budgeting is ill\r\nserved by existing processes. We share the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s logic that focusing on outcomes requires a\r\nrealignment of resources against priorities. This should\r\nbe supported by budgeting and planning mechanisms\r\nthat can adapt to change, that are integrated and that\r\nencourage a more efficient and strategic approach to\r\ndecision-making.\r\nWe have said before that we do not view change\r\nas a cost-cutting exercise. But we must acknowledge\r\nthat the Organization faces a problem with resources.\r\nWe must make the best use of the resources available.\r\nIf we can streamline the process of planning and\r\nallocating budgets, this will free up resources to\r\nredirect to substantive mandates of the Organization.\r\nWe do not have the exact details yet of how actions 21\r\nand 22 will be implemented, but we are ready now to\r\nsign on to the key principles: the budget presentation\r\nshould be more strategic; the planning and budget\r\nprocesses must be streamlined; and the budget and\r\nplanning cycles should be aligned.\r\nMany other elements in this report relate to work\r\nin progress that will produce results in future. The\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nSecretary-General’s commitment to a process of\r\nincremental change is reinforced by the tasking he has\r\ninitiated within the Secretariat to look again at the way\r\nprogrammes and systems work in the areas of technical\r\ncooperation, human rights, public information and\r\nhuman resources management. We welcome the across-\r\nthe-board review of the information activities and\r\nhuman rights machinery of the United Nations. We see\r\na need for a global, integrated approach to these\r\nactivities. We look forward to seeing the results of the\r\nvarious reviews in due course.\r\nWe have before us a political document that\r\nrequires a political response. The Secretary-General\r\nhas prepared a comprehensive package that signals the\r\nfuture direction of his ongoing reform efforts. In his\r\nown words, “they cannot be implemented automatically\r\nor overnight”. We have been asked to provide a strong\r\nendorsement for the report. We are happy to do so and\r\nwould, in fact, have gone further. In the light of the\r\nchallenges currently facing the international\r\ncommunity, we see an urgent need to revitalize this\r\nmost important of multilateral institutions. We need to\r\nact now. We need an Organization that can adapt and\r\nrespond to the myriad challenges facing us —\r\nincluding achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals and responding to HIV/AIDS, globalization and\r\nterrorism — many of which myriad challenges were\r\nnot conceived of when the Organization was\r\nestablished more than 50 years ago.\r\nWe endorse an incremental approach, but would\r\nurge that this not be so subtly incremental as to\r\nproduce little discernible improvement in the near\r\nfuture. Obviously our decisions must be well informed\r\nand well considered. But at this juncture the Secretary-\r\nGeneral asks us to sign on to the overall principle and\r\ndirection — broad direction, as he said earlier — in his\r\nreport. We are ready to do so.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the African\r\nGroup on item 52 of the agenda, “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations system”, an item to which the African\r\nGroup attaches great importance, given its concern for\r\nthe strengthening of the Organization and its desire to\r\ncontribute to its efficiency in a manner that will enable\r\nit to deal with new challenges and opportunities.\r\nThe African Group wishes to express to the\r\nSecretary-General its sincere appreciation for his\r\nimportant report under consideration today, entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change”. We believe that that report includes\r\nmany positive proposals that would improve the\r\nefficiency and increase the impact of the United\r\nNations. I would like to apologize in advance for the\r\ndetailed manner in which I shall address those issues\r\non behalf of my Group. We would also like to endorse\r\nthe statement made by Venezuela, on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe African Group believes that the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations is an uninterrupted\r\nsequence and an ongoing process that will not come to\r\nan end. It should be comprehensive, determining the\r\nlong-term strategic direction of the Organization as\r\nwell as the steps that are to be taken in the medium and\r\nshort terms. Experts from the Group have carefully\r\nconsidered the report in various committees, as well as\r\nwithin the group of African ambassadors at the United\r\nNations. The African Group has reached a preliminary\r\nposition with regard to the content of the report, and\r\nhas prepared a number of more detailed questions for\r\nthe Secretariat with regard to the actions proposed in\r\nthe report. A list of those questions is available at the\r\nside of the General Assembly Hall. The African Group\r\nlooks forward to receiving clarifications from the\r\nSecretariat that will enable the Group to take a final\r\nposition on the proposals and to participate effectively\r\nwith States and groups of States in the consultations to\r\nbe conducted in the coming weeks on the draft\r\nresolution to be adopted by the General Assembly on\r\nthis issue.\r\nIn considering the proposals set out in the report,\r\nthe African Group took into account not only the\r\ndegree to which such proposals can be implemented,\r\nbut also the consequences of their implementation. We\r\ntherefore ask that a distinction be made between the\r\nproposals that fall within the purview of the\r\nSecretary-General and those that would require\r\nintergovernmental approval, or that might lead to\r\nconflict with mandates that have been established by\r\nthe intergovernmental machinery, as those will require\r\nfurther careful consideration.\r\nThe African Group would also like to stress the\r\nimportance of a harmonious and complete\r\nconsideration of all efforts to strengthen the United\r\nNations, to introduce innovations in the way in which\r\nthe General Assembly works and to promote the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and its substantive\r\ncommittees. We also accord great importance to\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nfollowing up the implementation of the resolutions\r\nadopted at the Millennium Summit and at other\r\nimportant international conferences and summits.\r\nGiven the strong link between all those objectives, they\r\ncannot be considered in isolation from one another.\r\nThe development agenda of the United Nations is\r\nof particular importance to the African Group. We have\r\ntherefore always stressed the central role to be played\r\nby the Organization in formulating environmental,\r\nsocial and economic policies at the international level.\r\nThe Group has repeatedly called for increasing the\r\neffectiveness of United Nations operational activities in\r\nthe field and for bringing about the required\r\ncoordination among all those activities in a manner that\r\nwould help avoid any additional institutional burdens\r\non developing countries and on African countries in\r\nparticular.\r\nThe Group has also called for a more effective\r\nresponse by the United Nations to the sharp decrease\r\nthat we have witnessed over many years in the basic\r\nresources of various programmes and funds, which is\r\nhindering the Organization’s efforts to implement its\r\nprogrammes in support of the capabilities of\r\ndeveloping countries. We therefore believe that action\r\n14 should refer to the steps that will have to be taken in\r\nensuring further, more predictable resource\r\nmobilization. While we welcome the contents of action\r\n15 relating to the drafting of a document by 2003 to\r\ndetermine roles and responsibilities in the area of\r\ntechnical cooperation, the Group believes that the\r\nobjective of such a document should do more than just\r\nassist donor countries to take decisions. Such a\r\ndocument should be considered within a\r\ncomprehensive intergovernmental framework that\r\nwould allow for guidelines to be drawn up to govern\r\nthe Secretariat’s work in that very important field.\r\nThe African Group also attaches great importance\r\nto the implementation of the Millennium Declaration of\r\nSeptember 2000. That Declaration included many\r\ninternational objectives to which heads of State or\r\nGovernment committed themselves within specific\r\ntime frames. Given our strong belief in the importance\r\nof implementing those objectives, and while\r\nwelcoming the efforts of the Secretary-General and the\r\nSecretariat to promote those objectives and mobilize\r\nthe necessary financial and institutional capabilities for\r\ntheir implementation, we would like to stress that it\r\nshould not lead to any reduction in the importance of\r\nother development goals. Such goals were adopted by\r\nthe international community at international\r\nconferences and summits and special sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that preceded the Millennium\r\nSummit, as well as those conferences that followed the\r\nSummit, such as the World Summit for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, the Third United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Least Developed Countries and the World\r\nConference against racism.\r\nThe African Group believes that all the objectives\r\nset out and the decisions taken at summits and\r\ninternational conferences should be reflected in the\r\nproposed programme budget for 2004-2005.\r\nIn that regard, the African Group requests that the\r\nSecretariat, in the context of updating its approach to\r\nthe implementation of Action 1 contained in the report\r\nof the Secretary-General, to present to the Assembly its\r\nviews on the steps that can be taken to expedite the\r\nimplementation of all African development goals,\r\ntaking into account the fact that the African continent\r\nhas not experienced the degree of progress enjoyed by\r\nother geographical areas.\r\nThe African Group emphasizes the importance of\r\nstrengthening the Secretariat’s work with regard to the\r\nAfrican continent. The Group notes the decision of the\r\nSecretary-General, mentioned in the context of Action\r\n18, to transfer the resources allocated to the Office of\r\nthe Special Coordinator for Africa and the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries to the Office of the Adviser for\r\nSpecial Assignments in Africa. The Group stresses the\r\nneed for further clarification with regard to the details\r\nof the mission of the Adviser for Special Assignments\r\nand it requests that he present his reports directly to the\r\nSecretary-General, taking into account the international\r\nconsensus that particular priority be given to Africa in\r\nthe coming phase.\r\nThe Group also looks forward to receiving the\r\nSecretary-General’s views concerning how the\r\ninstitutional capabilities of the United Nations will be\r\nstrengthened in order to address, in a coordinated and\r\neffective way, the African continent’s needs in the light\r\nof the General Assembly’s decisions and of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\ninitiative, as the new framework within which the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community will\r\nprovide assistance to Africa. The African Group also\r\nrequests, within that new institutional framework, the\r\nmonitoring and follow-up of the fulfilment of the\r\ncommitment of the United Nations and the\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\ninternational community in the implementation of\r\nNEPAD to ensure the needed harmony and\r\ncoordination among various departments of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nThe African Group believes in the positive role\r\nplayed by the institutions of civil society and of the\r\nprivate sector as partners with Governments in\r\nformulating and implementing policies at the national,\r\nregional and international levels. We note with interest\r\nAction 19 contained in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nwith regard to the interaction between civil society and\r\nthe United Nations, as well as the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to establish a panel of eminent personalities to\r\nconsider the matter. In that regard, we should like to\r\nrequest that the guidelines for the panel be formulated\r\nwithin the intergovernmental context, taking into\r\naccount the importance of equitable representation of\r\ndeveloping countries and that the report and its\r\nrecommendations be considered within the framework\r\nof the intergovernmental mechanism.\r\nWe note with great interest the proposed\r\nmeasures to promote the work of the United Nations\r\nsystem in the field of human rights. We should like to\r\nemphasize that the African Group fully endorses all\r\nefforts to promote the Organization’s role in\r\nguaranteeing and protecting human rights. We should\r\nalso like to stress the following important\r\nconsiderations: First, it is necessary that the general\r\nmembership of the Organization debate and adopt any\r\nnew approaches before their implementation and that\r\nlinkages between human rights and development be\r\navoided, including conditions in the Organization’s\r\noperational activities that run counter to established\r\npractice and to the principles of universality, neutrality\r\nand multilateralism. Secondly, it is important that\r\nresident representatives of the United Nations limit\r\nthemselves to their established mandates and that they\r\nnot attempt to expand or exchange those mandates\r\nwithout the approval of the States concerned. Thirdly,\r\nwhile we welcome all efforts aimed at improving the\r\nreporting system for United Nations machinery, it is\r\nimportant to consider all aspects of that issue with the\r\nStates concerned in a way that ensures effectiveness\r\nand applicability. Fourthly, in the implementation of\r\nhuman rights measures, it is important to be committed\r\nto established mandates, particularly in the case of\r\nSpecial Rapporteurs, some of whom have exceeded\r\ntheir mandates in a way that could undermine their\r\nneutrality.\r\nThe African Group supports all efforts aimed at\r\nthe development of United Nations activities in the\r\nfield of information and at strengthening the\r\neffectiveness of the Department of Public Information.\r\nTherefore, we believe that the Department’s proposed\r\nrestructuring should be initiated by consulting with\r\nMember States and should start with the Committee on\r\nInformation. With regard to United Nations\r\nInformation Centres, the African Group believes that\r\nthe establishment of regional information offices would\r\nbe beneficial only in areas that are advanced in\r\ncommunication and information technologies. Member\r\nStates should establish guidelines for the application of\r\nsuch a proposal in a way that allows for separate\r\nconsideration of each case and through consultations\r\nwith host States.\r\nThe African Group welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals to develop, plan and coordinate\r\npublications in order to improve them and to make\r\ntheir contents more focused. The Group believes that\r\nany decision concerning the financial feasibility of\r\npublications should be taken in consultation with the\r\nUnited Nations intergovernmental bodies responsible\r\nfor administrative and financial issues.\r\nThe African Group supports all efforts to enhance\r\nthe efficiency and the impact of the United Nations,\r\nincluding the rationalizing of the Organization’s\r\nadministrative and financial activities. The Group\r\nwould like to reaffirm once again the importance of\r\nrules and regulations governing programme planning\r\nand the programmatic aspects of the budget in the\r\nmonitoring, implementation and evaluation process.\r\nThe application of Article 105/6 (a) of those\r\nregulations should take into account the understanding\r\nthat the adoption of the medium-term plan and of the\r\nprogramme budget constitute a reaffirmation of all the\r\nmandates that they include.\r\nIn conclusion, with regard to the Organization\r\nand its staff, the African Group welcomes the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals on mechanisms and\r\nincentives to encourage United Nations personnel to\r\nbecome more mobile within the Organization. We\r\nreiterate the relevant paragraphs of resolution 55/258\r\non human resources management, particularly with\r\nregard to the promotion of General Service staff to the\r\nProfessional level. The Secretary-General may wish to\r\nconsider an increase in the number of posts allocated to\r\nGeneral Service staff, particularly those that are not\r\nsubject to geographical distribution.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nThe African Group also welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s intention to conduct a review of the internal\r\njustice system in order to enhance its effectiveness and\r\nto guarantee the equitable and legal treatment of all\r\nstaff members.\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express my gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for initiating the new reform\r\nproposals aimed at transforming the United Nations\r\ninto an effective universal Organization prepared to\r\naddress global challenges. I should also praise the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General and her colleagues for\r\npreparing the report entitled “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”, which\r\ninspires new ideas and provides inputs for the Member\r\nStates in their future deliberations on the topic.\r\nLet me also associate myself with the statement\r\nmade by the representative of Venezuela on behalf of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nReform is not only a necessity, but also an\r\nobligation in setting up a dynamic international\r\ninstitution in the age of globalization. Although there\r\nhave been some improvements so far as a result of the\r\nimplementation of reform measures introduced and\r\nadopted in 1997, more changes have yet to be\r\neffectuated. The principal challenge ahead will be to\r\nenhance the capacities and to strengthen the\r\ncapabilities of the multilateral machinery towards\r\ncollective action in response to global demands and\r\nconcerns. Hence, any reform proposal should refrain\r\nfrom offering selective approaches and rather present\r\nsolutions on how to enable the United Nations to\r\nimplement the priorities identified by its Member\r\nStates, particularly during such recent global meetings\r\nas the Millennium Summit, the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nA more vibrant General Assembly requires proper\r\nand necessary changes in its agenda and methods of\r\nwork. Even more, its reform process should hinge upon\r\nthe acknowledgement of the fundamental role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly as the unique forum in which all\r\nStates have an equal voice through the establishment of\r\nconcrete and reliable mechanisms for the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions.\r\nThe same approach may be chosen in respect of\r\nthe proposed reform for the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. Meanwhile, we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that making the Council a privileged global\r\nforum for shaping development policies and strategies\r\nentails innovative measures, such as conducting\r\ndialogues with the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization annually to better inform\r\nthem of the sensitivities involved in their deliberations\r\nand policies vis-à-vis the composite difficulties which\r\ndeveloping countries face. In this connection, reform of\r\nthe Security Council should also be designed to\r\npromote an appropriate environment that upholds the\r\nimperatives of the balanced economic development of\r\nall regions in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nWe welcome the assertion of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the importance of the development aspects\r\nof the work of the United Nations. However, there is no\r\nproposed concrete action in the report to ensure its\r\nadequacy and its success in practice. Among major\r\npriorities that have been identified in the outcomes of\r\nrecently held conferences, only one or two areas have\r\nbeen addressed, while there are other numerous issues\r\nand priorities that have been left behind. In none of the\r\nsections of the report can a reference be found\r\nconcerning the recent institutional agreements\r\nundertaken at the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment in chapter X of the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation, which has brought new changes to the\r\nwork of the different parts of the United Nations\r\nsystem.\r\nWith regard to coordination at the country level\r\nand the proposed new functions for the resident\r\ncoordinator system, it is absolutely clear that, in\r\naddition to budgetary implications, any modification in\r\nthe already agreed mandates of the United Nations\r\nfunds and programmes requires the prior approval of\r\nthe Member States. Moreover, any proposal which puts\r\nforward new functions as a conditionality for the\r\nmaintenance of development activities at the field level\r\nwould substantially distort the scope, nature and\r\nmandate of the United Nations funds and programmes,\r\nas well as those of the resident coordinator system,\r\nthus jeopardizing their development-based agenda and\r\ncounteracting genuine efforts to improve overall\r\nefficiency.\r\nIt is precisely in this context that my delegation is\r\nof the view that broadening the scope of the activities\r\nof the resident coordinator system in order\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\n“to ensure that human rights are incorporated into\r\ncountry level analysis, planning and programme\r\nimplementation” (A/57/387, para. 51)\r\nneeds to be carefully discussed within the relevant\r\nintergovernmental frameworks and through the\r\nprocedures designated by the United Nations.\r\nBenefiting from the ultimate support of partner\r\ninstitutions is highly recommendable, yet it should be\r\ndone within the mandates of each and every component\r\nof the United Nations system. Any step beyond the\r\nmandate must come about through the established\r\nprocedures of the United Nations. This basic assertion\r\nholds true for the reforms proposed in the area of treaty\r\nbodies and reporting obligations of the States parties,\r\nas well as for setting criteria for human rights special\r\nprocedures. While we believe that reducing the\r\nreporting obligations and related burdens of States\r\nparties to the different treaty bodies is of crucial\r\nimportance to them, the effort to remove ambiguities\r\nand the elaboration of best practices through the full\r\nparticipation of Member States in the relevant\r\nprocesses are also highly required.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe restructuring and review of the activities of\r\nthe Department of Public Information should aim at\r\nstrengthening the role and activities of the Department\r\nand not at its gradual diminution. Since some functions\r\ncurrently undertaken by the Department may not be\r\nconsonant with its core mission, we think the review\r\ncould be considered as an opportunity to focus more on\r\nrelevant mandated activities. As regards the proposed\r\nrationalization of the network of United Nations\r\nInformation Centres, the idea of regional hubs is a\r\npositive initiative for developed regions, but the issue\r\nis much more complex in the case of developing\r\ncountries. We believe the role of United Nations\r\nInformation Centres should be strengthened in\r\ndeveloping countries. The Centres also need to\r\ncontinue developing their own web pages in local\r\nlanguages.\r\nMy delegation has noted the concerns expressed\r\nhere regarding the number, coherence and impact of\r\nUnited Nations reports, as well as the planning and\r\nmanagement of meetings. We believe that it is the\r\nprerogative of Member States to discuss and propose\r\nremedial measures within intergovernmental bodies\r\nand establish criteria for consolidating identical reports\r\non cross-cutting subjects, while maintaining balance\r\namong various issues.\r\nWe welcome the idea of simplification and\r\nimprovement in the planning and budgetary process of\r\nthe United Nations. To better reflect priorities in\r\nplanning, we need to ensure that all intergovernmental\r\nmandates — aside from the Millennium Declaration\r\npriorities, which are long-term in nature, but including\r\nthose of the General Assembly and the outcomes of\r\nrecent international Conferences — are incorporated in\r\nthe medium-term plan as the basic strategic guidance\r\nunderpinning the work of the Organization. This\r\nprogramme planning, updated by the required revision\r\nat the mid-point of its term, should continue to be\r\nbased on political mandates. Hence, budget allocations\r\nshould serve as the basis of decisions with regard to the\r\nplanning of exercises or the possible termination of\r\nprogrammes, as in the case of sunset provisions.\r\nEfforts to improve the existing coherence between\r\nplanning and budgeting exercises should not jeopardize\r\nthe rationality and credibility of this process, which is\r\nbased primarily on the imperative of allocating\r\nresources to achieve full implementation of the\r\nmandates given by Member States. To this end, the\r\neffective involvement of separate intergovernmental\r\nbodies — namely, the Fifth Committee and the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) —\r\nto perform these functions is fairly justified, taking into\r\naccount that these bodies are rather complementary and\r\nmutually reinforcing.\r\nWe share the well-crafted vision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral concerning the reform of human resources\r\ndevelopment and management. The impact and vitality\r\nof the Organization rests upon having capable\r\ninternational staff, who represent a variety of\r\ndedicated, talented potential from all over the world.\r\nPromoting the excellence of the United Nations\r\nworkplace needs to be pursued, but realization of the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution should\r\nbe one of the main objectives of the reform in this area.\r\nAs regards the delegation of authority, we are of\r\nthe view that, along with any delegation of authority, a\r\nclear mechanism of accountability should be in place.\r\nThis provision, as well as many other issues, were\r\ndiscussed and decided last year by the General\r\nAssembly. The results of those deliberations were\r\nenlightening and continue to be a basis for\r\nconsolidating diverse views in examining proposals.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nIn conclusion, Sir, I wish to assure you once\r\nagain of my delegation’s full cooperation in proceeding\r\nwith the debates and deliberations on this subject in\r\ninformal consultations.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria) (spoke in French):\r\nPermit me first of all, Sir, to convey my sincere\r\ncongratulations to the Secretary-General for his\r\ninitiative in submitting a new series of proposals for\r\nreform in his report entitled “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387). This is a praiseworthy initiative that\r\nconfirms yet again his determination to give new\r\nimpetus to the process of reform in our Organization.\r\nThis initiative seeks to deepen the process of\r\nreform that was launched in 1997, the essential goal of\r\nwhich was the adaptation of internal structures and the\r\nculture of the United Nations to the new challenges\r\nfacing it.\r\nMy delegation also associates itself with the\r\nstatements made by South Africa on behalf of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, by Venezuela on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and by Egypt on behalf of the African\r\nGroup. At this preliminary stage of our consideration\r\nof the report, I would like to share with the Assembly\r\nsome comments and views on some aspects of the\r\nproposed reform that are of vital importance to my\r\ndelegation.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly anticipated our expectations by\r\ninforming us of his intention to organize informal\r\nconsultations to examine concrete proposals for which\r\nthe Secretary-General is asking the approval of\r\nMember States. In this context and in light of the\r\nimportance of the question, perhaps Permanent\r\nRepresentatives themselves should become involved in\r\nthe process of negotiation and support the efforts of the\r\nexperts, with a view to reaching agreement on this\r\naspect of the formula.\r\nOn questions of substance, the report contains 35\r\nproposals relating to such important areas as human\r\nrights, information, administrative and budgetary\r\naspects and economic cooperation. We share the\r\nSecretary-General’s view on the need to continue with\r\nreform, with a view to meeting the challenge of\r\nstrengthening our collective capacity, thus forging a\r\ncommon destiny in a world of increasingly rapid\r\nchange. We are grateful to the Secretary-General for\r\nhaving given us a succinct account of what has been\r\naccomplished in the realm of reform before suggesting\r\nto us what still remains to be done in this long process.\r\nSome of the actions contemplated are within the\r\ncompetence of the Secretary-General, and we thank\r\nhim for having reported to Member States on it. Others\r\nare within the competence of intergovernmental bodies,\r\nwhich should examine them with care and\r\ntransparency, in such a way as to make possible the\r\nparticipation of all delegations in the process of\r\nexamination and decision-making.\r\nAs to the idea of re-focusing the activity of the\r\nOrganization on priorities laid down during the\r\nMillennium Assembly, my delegation, repeating its\r\ncommitment to the Millennium goals, would point out\r\nthat these priorities are already an integral part of the\r\nmedium-term plan for 2002-2005. In other words, the\r\npriorities laid down in the Millennium Declaration\r\nshould not be allowed to replace the other legislative\r\nmandates, which should also be reflected in the\r\nmedium-term plan.\r\nWe also wish to reaffirm the positive role of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination as the\r\nconsultative body of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council in the planning process.\r\nWe believe that, in spite of certain shortcomings that\r\nare not specific to that body, the Committee is\r\nsatisfactorily discharging its functions, such as\r\nverifying the existence of mandates for all the activities\r\nfor inclusion in, or omission from, programmes\r\ncontained in the medium-term plan and ruling on the\r\nconformity of the interpretation of these mandates with\r\nthe decisions of the deliberative bodies. The\r\nCommittee also has the task of verifying the technical\r\ncorrectness of the presentation of programmes and to\r\nensure compliance with the priorities laid down in the\r\nmedium-term plan. In that regard, I wish to stress that\r\nthe most recent substantive session of the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination, held last July, was\r\nexemplary in terms of its success and effectiveness,\r\ngiven that the Committee completed its work in four\r\nweeks instead of the six weeks initially scheduled.\r\nThe medium-term plan is the cornerstone of the\r\ncycle of programme planning, budgeting, monitoring\r\nand evaluation of the United Nations. Because it\r\nreflects in terms of programmes and sub-programmes\r\nthe directives given by the deliberative bodies, the\r\nmedium-term plan determines the general direction of\r\nthe United Nations and is a framework for the\r\npreparation of biennial programme budgets for the\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nperiod covered by the plan. Thus, while noting the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal to submit a shorter\r\nmedium-term plan, we would like to understand the\r\nadvantages and implications that will be entailed in the\r\nimplementation of that measure.\r\nWith regard to programme evaluation, it is\r\nimportant to continue to abide by rule 105.6 (a) of the\r\nregulations and rules governing programme planning,\r\nbudgetary aspects connected with programmes,\r\nperformance monitoring and evaluation methods. We\r\nbelief that the lack of will or any other subjective\r\nreason which may have led to the ineffective\r\nimplementation of a mandated activity should not\r\nautomatically lead to ending it because of\r\nobsolescence. That is the main reason why, throughout\r\nthe past few years, we have been opposed to the\r\nconcept of sunset clauses, and we continue to be\r\ncommitted to the strict application of rule 105.6 (a),\r\ncited earlier.\r\nRegarding human rights, we welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiatives to strengthen the United\r\nNations system in the area of promoting and protecting\r\nhuman rights. Nevertheless, we would like a reform\r\nprocess affecting an issue as sensitive as human rights\r\nto take place in the spirit of the World Conference on\r\nHuman Rights, held at Vienna in 1993, taking into\r\naccount the indivisible and interdependent character of\r\nhuman rights and the principles of non-selectivity and\r\nimpartiality, which should guide this very delicate\r\nreform exercise. This exercise is necessary, particularly\r\nin terms of rationalizing the procedures for drawing up\r\nreports by treaty bodies and for the management\r\nmethods of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s commitment to strengthening information as\r\na key element of reforming and revitalizing the United\r\nNations system. However, reform of the Department of\r\nPublic Information should not depend solely on\r\nfinancial criteria. In our view any reorientation of the\r\nDepartment should have the effect of maintaining and\r\nimproving its activities of particular interest for\r\ndeveloping countries and should be aimed at bridging\r\nthe gap between the developing countries and the\r\ndeveloped countries in that critical area. We urge the\r\nSecretariat to continue its consultations with the\r\nCommittee on Information on restructuring or\r\nreorienting the activities of the Department of Public\r\nInformation.\r\nWith regard to the proposal to create regional\r\ninformation centres, we note that many regional hubs\r\nare located in regions where costs are very high\r\nand where information and telecommunication\r\ninfrastructures are well developed. In less favoured\r\nregions, that operation should be undertaken on a case-\r\nby-case basis, in consultation with the host countries\r\nconcerned.\r\nThe recent International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development, held at Monterrey, and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held at\r\nJohannesburg, are critically important to strengthening\r\ninternational economic cooperation. In that regard, we\r\nbelieve that it is timely to integrate the follow-up of the\r\nfulfilment of commitments into the process of\r\nfollowing up the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which would make possible the adoption\r\nof a comprehensive, coherent and integrated approach\r\nin attaining development goals.\r\nThe African continent, whose specific needs were\r\na priority of the Millennium Summit, should continue\r\nto receive special attention. The New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), which enjoys the\r\nsolid support of the international community, deserves\r\nsubstantial support consistent with its ambitions,\r\nparticularly through strengthening the relevant\r\nSecretariat structure so that it can effectively take\r\ncharge of the international community’s support\r\nactivities for the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nThose are a few comments on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals for reform; and I wish to assure the\r\nAssembly of the wholehearted cooperation of my\r\ndelegation and of its readiness to contribute\r\nconstructively to the successful outcome of our\r\ndeliberations on this important question.\r\nMr. Bennouna (Morocco) (spoke in French): The\r\nKingdom of Morocco is genuinely pleased to take part\r\nin this debate and to make a modest contribution to the\r\nAssembly’s collective reflection on reforming the\r\nUnited Nations. We wish to warmly thank the\r\nSecretary-General for having introduced to us this\r\nmorning a very useful and stimulating report on\r\nstrengthening the Organization (A/57/387).\r\nA strong, credible and effective United Nations is\r\nin the interest of all Member States, whatever their\r\nstatus, their level of development or the means\r\navailable to them. That is why the objectives of which\r\nMr. Kofi Annan reminded us this morning deserve our\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nsupport and, undoubtedly, that of the entire Assembly.\r\nIt is in everyone’s clear interest to further rationalize\r\nour work, to make better use of the resources available\r\nto us, to avoid duplication and overlapping and, finally,\r\nto endow the executive branch with the most modern\r\ntools, so that it can carry out the tasks with which we\r\nhave entrusted it. Those tasks are becoming\r\nincreasingly complex; they are in keeping with the\r\nphenomenon of globalization, which imposes on the\r\ninternational community the duty of turning the United\r\nNations into a credible and efficient regulatory body,\r\nbecause, as has been said, if the market is becoming\r\nglobal, then the rules must also become global. The\r\nregulatory activity that is expected of us ranges from\r\ninternational trade, financing for development and\r\nprotecting the environment to combating crime and\r\nterrorism. As we all know and we unfortunately see\r\ntoday, terrorists have formed an international network\r\nand it is only through prosecution at the same level,\r\nthat we can effectively combat their activities. We\r\nwelcome the 9 September 2002 report. It is part of the\r\nreform activity initiated in 1997. However, reform is\r\nnot an overnight phenomenon, nor a miracle. As Mr.\r\nKofi Annan reminded us, it is a continuous effort and\r\nwe must be in it for the long run.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the very survival\r\nof the Organization probably depends on successful\r\nreform. In a world undergoing fundamental change, we\r\ncan no longer expect to succeed through the use of\r\nmethods and responses from the second half of the\r\ntwentieth century, from a bygone world.\r\nWe also know that we cannot simply tear down\r\nour own house, which is why we completely support\r\nthe Secretary-General’s method. He begins by asking\r\nus to focus on the indispensable tools for change,\r\nplanning goals and establishing what means would be\r\nsuitable to attain the goals. The planning and budgeting\r\nmust go hand in hand and must be envisaged and\r\ncarried out within a reasonable period of time, for\r\nexample two years as the Secretary-General suggested.\r\nWe support wholeheartedly his proposal, although\r\nwe believe that during implementation, we will have to\r\nmake planning and budgeting less bureaucratic. We\r\nshould not be ashamed, but must adapt to the world as\r\nit is. Envisaging the plan and budget will be based on\r\ntechnical information provided by the administration,\r\nbut it must be carried out at the higher political level,\r\nthe level of the Secretary-General.\r\nWe are also convinced that the Secretary-General\r\nmust enjoy, as he has requested, a degree of flexibility\r\nin terms of managing the overall budget. This\r\nflexibility we are entrusting to the highest official of\r\nthe Organization and will have to include evaluations\r\nand reports to the governmental bodies, that will, in\r\nturn, evaluate the initiatives taken and make the\r\nnecessary recommendations. These bodies include the\r\nFifth Committee as well as the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination (CPC).\r\nNowadays, no efficient institution will succeed\r\nwithout good management, or good governance. The\r\nSecretary-General must be sure to achieve his\r\nobjectives at the least possible cost and will have to\r\nreallocate resources according to new developments on\r\nthe international scene. He will have to keep up a\r\ndialogue with the main organs of the United Nations, in\r\nparticular the Security Council and the General\r\nAssembly. In other words, when he is allocating\r\nresources he will have to do so on the basis of a\r\ndialogue held through proper channels.\r\nThe General Assembly has universal status, but it\r\nwill have to restructure itself if it wishes to face the\r\nnew challenges before the Organization and new work\r\nmethods. Today we hear about revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly, as if it was an ill patient requiring more\r\nenergy. In fact what is necessary is just to bring our\r\nGeneral Assembly and its methods in line with the\r\nincreased number of Members, the nature of the\r\nquestions it addresses, and evolution and developments\r\nin modern techniques of communication and\r\ninformation.\r\nThese tasks I have described must take place at\r\nthe same time as the reform of the Secretariat, for this\r\nis the only way to ensure that reform will have the best\r\nimpact. We are happy to see that the Presidency, aware\r\nof this link between reforming the Secretariat and\r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly intends to emphasize\r\nrevitalization at the very moment when reform of the\r\nSecretariat is under way.\r\nWe hope this activity of general interest will be\r\ncarried out without reference to any special interests,\r\nand with the desire to ensure that those who are most\r\nready to serve the reform and are best qualified will\r\nplace themselves at the service of the Organization.\r\nThe United Nations is based on the sovereign\r\nequality of its Member States. But when we refer to\r\nStates, as well as individuals, as we know some are\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nmore equal than others. Africa is the continent that is\r\nleast well endowed, and has suffered the most from\r\ndevelopments that have occurred throughout the world\r\nover the last quarter century. It is therefore almost\r\nnatural for everyone to display active solidarity\r\ntowards the African countries, and this solidarity\r\nshould be reflected by the Secretariat through a focal\r\npoint, a special adviser to Mr. Kofi Annan, as has been\r\nproposed, who will coordinate and centralize the\r\nexecutive activities of the United Nations in the\r\ndirection of Africa, because today’s activities are too\r\nscattered. This activity will include something my\r\ncountry values highly, attention to the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development.\r\nIn order for an organization to exist, it must act\r\nand it must disseminate information. It must\r\ncommunicate with its environment and receive\r\nfeedback so it may permanently regenerate. However,\r\nshould we try to communicate as we were\r\ncommunicating during the post-war period in the last\r\nquarter century? This is why we approved the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals to modernize the\r\nDepartment of Public Information (DPI) to enable it to\r\nperform better and cost less. In undertaking this reform\r\nof DPI, the needs of the developed countries and their\r\nconcerns are not the same as those of the less well-\r\nendowed countries, in particular in Africa as I\r\nmentioned earlier.\r\nIt goes without saying that any reform process\r\nmust be careful not to lose sight of the fact that its final\r\nobjective is the human being. The United Nations has\r\nplayed an indispensable part in promoting human\r\nrights, in making them acceptable and habituating the\r\nmost diverse cultural sensitivities to their importance.\r\nThese past efforts, these geological layers, as it were,\r\nshould today be evaluated globally in order to find\r\nmore appropriate oversight mechanisms for the\r\npreservation of human rights.\r\nIt is obvious that the multiplication of committees\r\nof experts depending on this or that convention is a\r\nmethod that can be faulted, because it compels even the\r\nleast well endowed countries to prepare multiple\r\noverlapping reports that require the services of experts.\r\nWe believe this assessment process should be entrusted\r\nto the United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights in Geneva and he should propose the most\r\nappropriate manner of simplifying these processes from\r\nthe legal and technical points of view.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco supports the efforts to\r\nreform the United Nations undertaken by Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan. We believe we must move forward by adopting\r\nthe areas of reform on which a consensus has formed\r\nwithin the Assembly. The remaining areas can be\r\nremitted to a follow-up group that could begin working\r\nnext year. Through that group, which could be an open-\r\nended working group, States could continue their\r\ndialogue with the Secretariat.\r\nIncreasingly, in a troubled world, people look\r\nanxiously to the United Nations in the hope of finding\r\ncomfort. We must act. We have no right to disappoint\r\nthem. We must act. We must respond to the\r\nexpectations of those who look to us.\r\nMr. Mejdoub (Tunisia) (spoke in French): One\r\nweek has passed since we celebrated United Nations\r\nDay. A retrospective analysis of our Organization’s 57\r\nyears of existence enables us to conclude the\r\nfollowing.\r\nThe United Nations has not lost any of its\r\nrelevance. The world needs the Organization more than\r\never to restore order in the global village, in\r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter. The multilateralism that our\r\nOrganization embodies has proved vital for the\r\nestablishment of international relations founded on\r\ndemocracy, inclusion, equality, justice and the equal\r\nsovereignty of States.\r\nBut the system we inherited following the Second\r\nWorld War needs to be brought up to date. During the\r\npast two decades, the world has experienced profound\r\nchanges, in particular globalization, with all its positive\r\nand negative effects. Those changes need to be\r\nreflected in the structural and operational apparatus of\r\nthe United Nations system, which now has the dual\r\nresponsibility of adapting to the needs of our time and\r\nof shaping the course of future events to avoid\r\ndirectionlessness.\r\nHowever, the United Nations is not an\r\nautonomous entity with its own sovereign decision-\r\nmaking power. Its action or inaction depends on the\r\ncollective decisions of its Member States. The\r\nOrganization’s effectiveness is dependent on the means\r\nand resources that we, the Member States, put at its\r\ndisposal. Its effectiveness also depends on our capacity\r\nto reconcile and even to restrain our national interests\r\nin the interest of the larger community.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nIt is on the basis of these observations that my\r\ndelegation would today like to assess the series of\r\nreforms presented by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport (A/57/387). In that regard, I would like to pay\r\ntribute to Mr. Kofi Annan, a far-sighted man who has\r\nbeen able to perceive the virtue of change in a world\r\nwhere change is the only constant. He has made the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations his personal cause.\r\nThrough his actions he has shown himself to be much\r\nwiser than we are, and history will undoubtedly prove\r\nhim right.\r\nI would also like to salute the efforts of\r\nMs. Louise Fréchette aimed at clarifying the proposed\r\nreforms for the benefit of the Member States and to\r\nexpress to the President our gratitude for the initiatives\r\nthat he has taken to facilitate the process\r\nof consideration of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations so as to bring the process to a\r\nsuccessful and prompt conclusion.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the common\r\nAfrican position on the Secretary-General’s measures\r\nand proposals for reform. I will thus limit myself to\r\nmaking the following comments and observations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report, which we\r\nwelcome, is part of a larger agenda and continuous\r\nprocess of reforming our Organization. It therefore\r\ngoes without saying that the structural, administrative\r\nand budgetary reforms presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral are not in themselves a sufficient response to\r\nthe need to adapt our Organization to the requirements\r\nof today’s world. In fact, as the Secretary-General has\r\nrightly indicated, the reform of the United Nations will\r\nnot be complete until the composition of the Security\r\nCouncil is modified and its efficiency and credibility\r\nare strengthened by improving its working methods\r\nand its decision-making process. Here, I am\r\nspecifically referring to the veto power.\r\nIt is equally obvious that the reforms presented\r\ncannot succeed unless the General Assembly is\r\nrevitalized. For that to happen, more than just cosmetic\r\nchanges are required. It is imperative that we restore to\r\nthe General Assembly, the truly universal and\r\ndemocratic organ of the Organization, its genuine role\r\nas described in the Charter. Its prerogatives should be\r\nmaintained and respected by the other principal organs\r\nof the Organization, and its authority vis-à-vis those\r\norgans should be fully exercised in the area of the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security, as well as with\r\nregard to economic, social and governance issues.\r\nThe reform process initiated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, if we make good use of it, is likely to give our\r\nOrganization a strategy for achieving concrete, tangible\r\nresults. The United Nations programme of work needs,\r\nas a matter of fact, to be rationalized. It should be\r\norganized around the goals contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and around the outcomes of\r\nthe major conferences, particularly the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. These\r\ngoals should be reflected in the Organization’s\r\nmedium-term plan and its programme budget in a way\r\nthat is coherent and which allows us to measure the\r\neffective implementation of those goals by means of\r\nresults indicators. However, those objectives should not\r\nreplace other existing mandates. Rather, they should\r\ncomplement them within the framework of an\r\nintegrated strategy based on the priorities identified by\r\nthe Member States.\r\nSuch a strategy should allow us to avoid the\r\noverlapping within our Organization, which the\r\nSecretary-General describes in his report. That\r\noverlapping results in a waste of energy and resources,\r\nconsiderable loss of time and, to a certain degree,\r\ninconsistency among the decisions of the legislative\r\nbodies. All those factors combined diminish the\r\nefficiency of our Organization. We therefore support\r\nthe Secretary- General’s proposals to regroup certain\r\nagenda items, to present consolidated reports on\r\nclosely related questions, to make use of new\r\ntechnologies and to end activities that are deemed to be\r\nuseless. In that regard, we believe that such a\r\nrationalization, which we support in principle, must be\r\ncarried out in consultation with Member States.\r\nDevelopment in all its dimensions should be\r\ncentral to the Organization’s concerns. In fact,\r\ndevelopment should be the Organization’s top priority.\r\nEvery debate we have had has illustrated beyond doubt\r\nthat the threats confronting our world cannot be\r\nalleviated or eliminated until people are freed from the\r\nyoke of poverty that usurps their right to basic human\r\ndignity. The right to development should be considered\r\nequal to other fundamental human rights and should be\r\npromoted through all of the activities of the United\r\nNations system.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nIn that regard, we are pleased with the attention\r\nthat the Secretary-General has given to activities aimed\r\nat benefiting Africa, as well as with his decision to\r\ndesignate an adviser for special assignments in Africa.\r\nWe hope that the mandate to be given to that adviser\r\nwill measure up to the expectations of African\r\ncountries, in particular as they relate to the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nReform should not be motivated by budgetary\r\nconcerns. The Secretary-General has clearly indicated\r\nthat his goal is neither to reduce the budget nor to\r\nrespond to conditions imposed from outside. That is\r\nreassuring to us, and the Secretary-General has our full\r\nconfidence. Nevertheless, we hope that the Member\r\nStates will not impose financial considerations as\r\ndetermining factors in drawing up our reform\r\nprogramme.\r\nThe set of reforms put forth by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be put into effect gradually and should\r\nbe subject to systematic evaluation. We note that some\r\naspects of the reform — particularly those associated\r\nwith human rights and information — will be the\r\nsubjects of further recommendations by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that will be based on studies to be submitted to\r\nhim. We also note that some proposals, especially those\r\nrelated to the administrative and budgetary areas, still\r\nrequire further clarification. The issue of accountability\r\nalso needs to be examined in more depth, and an\r\nadequate system of responsibility and control needs to\r\nbe established. We also believe that the competent\r\nbodies of the General Assembly should also look at\r\nvarious technical issues further before the General\r\nAssembly takes a decision.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating our\r\nappreciation for the new reforms proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General and by assuring the President of my\r\ndelegation’s full cooperation in the process of\r\nnegotiation that he will initiate following our debate.\r\nWe rely on him to preserve the transparency of that\r\nprocess and to ensure its openness.\r\nMr. Negroponte (United States): I am pleased to\r\naddress the General Assembly today on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s latest initiative aimed at strengthening this\r\nindispensable Organization. I join others in thanking\r\nthe Secretary-General for his dedicated stewardship.\r\nWe also wish to offer our compliments to President\r\nKavan for providing the opportunity to discuss this\r\nhighly important issue.\r\nLast Thursday, President Bush, in proclaiming\r\nUnited Nations Day in the United States, said that\r\nAmerica joined the world in commemorating the\r\nfounding of the Organization and in recognizing the\r\nprofound impact it has had on our world. He also\r\nreaffirmed the dedication of the United States, as a\r\nfounding Member, to advancing human rights, security\r\nand education throughout the world through the works\r\nof the United Nations. Many other nations have made\r\nsimilar proclamations. It is therefore most appropriate\r\nthat we gather here, just a week later, to discuss and\r\nagree on how the United Nations is to fulfil its critical\r\nrole in the years ahead. The United States has always\r\nbelieved that a strong, well-managed Organization\r\nfocused on its most important priorities is essential to\r\nensuring that the needs of Member States are fulfilled.\r\nWith the issuance of his latest report on reform,\r\nentitled “Strengthening the United Nations: an agenda\r\nfor further change” (A/57/387), the Secretary-General\r\nhas provided a new and valuable framework for\r\npursuing a programme of continuous improvement in\r\nthe Organization. While the United States has always\r\nendorsed the Secretary-General’s concept that reform is\r\na process, and not an event, we also believe in the need\r\nto quicken or re-enforce the process. Achieving\r\nmodernization, effective oversight and the elimination\r\nof redundant and obsolete functions are integral steps\r\nin that process. For this reason, “An agenda for further\r\nchange” is timely in providing a road map for\r\nimproving the Organization’s many programmes,\r\nstructures and operations.\r\nIn recent years, considerable progress has been\r\nmade in improving the working methods of the United\r\nNations. The staff and structure of the Secretariat have\r\nbeen streamlined; important changes have been made\r\nin human resources management; the scales of\r\nassessment have been updated; peacekeeping\r\nmanagement has become more efficient and effective\r\nand United Nations budgeting has become increasingly\r\nfocused on results. The Secretary-General’s latest\r\nreport builds on those improvements to maximize the\r\nuse of valuable resources and to ensure that the\r\nOrganization’s work is aligned closely with the\r\nMillennium Declaration Goals. We endorse his\r\napproach and his package of actions in their entirety. I\r\nwould like to comment, however, on a few key\r\nelements.\r\nWe look forward to a thoroughly revised\r\nprogramme budget for 2004 and 2005 that will better\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nreflect the priorities of Member States. In the same\r\nvein, we are encouraged by the steps listed in the report\r\nto improve the budget process, including the critical\r\nfunction of programme evaluation.\r\nThe measures aimed at improving\r\nintergovernmental coordination and avoiding\r\nduplication are long overdue and also most welcome.\r\nIn the important field of human rights, actions to\r\nstrengthen United Nations activities at the country\r\nlevel and to improve the overall management of the\r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\ndeserve priority attention. We warmly welcome the\r\nSecretary-General’s selection of Sergio Vieira de Mello\r\nas the new High Commissioner.\r\nRepositioning public information and conference\r\nservices is an essential component of a continuous\r\nimprovement programme for the Organization, since\r\nthey use an inordinate share of the overall budget and\r\ncan make important contributions to substantive\r\nprogrammes and activities. We support the bold\r\napproach taken to rationalize conference services, to\r\nreduce the number and volume of reports produced and\r\nto address the question of the number of meetings held.\r\nWe would expect a similarly innovative and aggressive\r\napproach to be followed for the public information\r\nfunction that could be implemented in less than three\r\nyears.\r\nBecause people are the United Nations most\r\nimportant resource, we are especially attracted to the\r\nmeasures in the field of human resources. Accelerating\r\nrecruitment, increasing the retention of qualified\r\npeople and improving mobility are all welcome\r\ncomponents of the initiative, while bearing in mind the\r\nstandards of Article 101 of the United Nations Charter.\r\nWithout exception, the actions laid out by the\r\nSecretary-General to maintain the United Nations as a\r\nrelevant and responsive institution are excellent ones.\r\nThey are fully consistent with the authorities and\r\nresponsibilities given to him as chief administrative\r\nofficer by Member States. As he implements his plan,\r\nwe pledge our support. We stand ready to assist in\r\nwhatever way we can. We join with other members in\r\nthe Hall in committing to making the Organization\r\nbetter and more responsive to the needs of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nMr. Mahbubani (Singapore): To avoid any\r\nmisunderstanding at any point in time about my\r\nremarks, let me stress at the outset that we fully\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387). We also support his call\r\nfor a strategic decision on this matter and, at the same\r\ntime, we also support the open and transparent\r\nprocedures that the President has suggested for the\r\nimplementation of, and follow-up to, the report. I will\r\ncomment on the report specifically a little later in my\r\nremarks. I thought that, in the first half of my remarks,\r\nit would be useful to encourage a discussion at the\r\nstrategic level on the issue of United Nations reform, as\r\nwe have been called upon to provide a strategic\r\ndecision.\r\nBefore doing that, I would like to mention a small\r\npersonal anecdote. I might possibly be one of the few\r\nveterans of United Nations reform present here. In\r\n1986 I was invited by the then President of the General\r\nAssembly to serve as a member of the Group of High-\r\nlevel Intergovernmental Experts set up to reform the\r\nUnited Nations, which was known as the Group of 18.\r\nAnd one little story taught me a valuable lesson. When\r\nI served on the Group of 18, we looked very hard to try\r\nto find parts of the United Nations system that could be\r\ntrimmed, cut off or shut down. We had great\r\ndifficulties but, in the end, we managed to find one\r\nlittle-known United Nations committee that we thought\r\nwas no longer necessary. If I remember correctly, I\r\nthink it was the United Nations Committee on\r\nTaxation. We all agreed that that Committee was really\r\nnot central to the work of the United Nations and that it\r\ncould be shut down. On the last day of our meetings,\r\njust as we were about to adopt our report, the delegate\r\nof the United States walked in to say that he was\r\nterribly sorry but the United States Treasury had\r\ninformed his delegation that they saw value in the\r\ncontinuation of the Committee on Taxation, and would\r\nwe not mind if it were not shut down.\r\nThe moral of the story here is that United Nations\r\nreform is inherently difficult if we try to go for the\r\nspecific items to be removed, because each Member\r\nState has a vested interest in one or another part of\r\nUnited Nations programmes. Therefore, before we go\r\ninto the details, we need to do a strategic review from a\r\nsort of “helicopter perspective” to see how the United\r\nNations looks in the world today and to look at its role.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, I hope that the key\r\nquestion that we will try to address in this debate is\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nthat of why we need to reform. I believe there may be\r\nfive possible answers.\r\nThe first might be that we are trying to reform\r\nbecause the United Nations is too big or huge. That\r\ncannot be so because, as an Organization, the United\r\nNations actually has a light footprint. If my memory is\r\ncorrect, the world’s gross national product (GNP) today\r\nis about $30 trillion. The annual United Nations budget\r\nis $1.5 billion. If my quick calculation is also correct,\r\nthat comes to 0.005 per cent of the global GNP. That is\r\nliterally and metaphorically a drop in the ocean. So if it\r\nis merely a drop in the ocean, is the purpose of our\r\nreform to make that drop even smaller, or is it to make\r\nthat drop a little bigger, given the increasing demands\r\nmade upon the United Nations?\r\nThe second possibility may be that we are trying\r\nto reform the United Nations because it is too\r\ninefficient. Certainly, the United Nations bureaucracy\r\nmust have its share of inefficiencies, and so forth. But\r\nas we try to reform the United Nations, are we clear in\r\nour minds about the benchmarks for progress? To\r\nwhich civil service in the world are we trying to\r\ncompare the United Nations civil service? If it is\r\ninefficient, to which standards are we comparing it?\r\nHaving worked quite closely in the Security Council\r\nwith at least two departments — the Department for\r\nPublic Information (DPI) and the Department for\r\nPeacekeeping Operations — I would say that, frankly,\r\nfrom my personal experience, those two Departments\r\nare possibly already world-class operations and\r\nperhaps could teach the rest of the world’s civil\r\nservices how to operate. So if we say that the United\r\nNations is inefficient and needs to be improved, we\r\nneed also to establish the standards necessary to be\r\nable to say that.\r\nThe third possible reason to reform may be that\r\nwe are fundamentally going in the wrong direction as\r\nan Organization. If that were so, if the United Nations\r\nwere fundamentally headed in the wrong direction,\r\nthen why is it that every time we hold a summit all the\r\nheads of State and Government turn up here to fill the\r\nHall with their presence? The reason they come here is\r\nthat the United Nations serves very effectively as the\r\nspiritual centre of the intergovernmental process.\r\nIndeed, I would also say that, in one of the most crucial\r\nroles it plays, the United Nations is the leading temple\r\nof legitimacy to which all agendas have to be brought\r\nand legitimized. Whether in the areas of development,\r\nthe environment or the fight against terrorism,\r\nwhatever one’s agenda, it must be brought to this Hall\r\nto have it legitimized before the global community\r\ncooperates. The fact that the world comes here to wrap\r\nits agendas in the mantle of United Nations legitimacy\r\nsuggests that the United Nations may not be\r\nfundamentally going in the wrong direction.\r\nThe fourth possibility is that the priorities may be\r\nwrong, that the United Nations might, in a sense, have\r\nwrongly allocated its priorities. Frankly, this is an area\r\nin which we can have a real discussion to address, as\r\nAmbassador Kumalo said earlier in this meeting, “the\r\nsuspicions and fears that the reform process seem to\r\nhave provoked”. But to address that we have to ask\r\nourselves what the real priorities of the United Nations\r\nsystem are. In that regard, if we had to identify the first\r\npriority we could not state it better than the way it was\r\nstated in the intervention earlier today on behalf of the\r\nEuropean Union: “The ultimate aim of our work in the\r\nUnited Nations is to make the world a better place for\r\nthe poor people of the planet.”\r\nWe endorse that call by the European Union. We\r\nalso agree that the primary goal should be to ensure\r\nthat the United Nations helps to make life better for the\r\npoor people of the planet. But if that is the case, we can\r\nindeed ask ourselves a very simple question: at present,\r\nare our priorities designed to achieve that? Of course,\r\nif we study the United Nations budget in detail, we\r\nmight be able to get a sense of how much money really\r\ngoes, or does not go, to helping the poor. One concrete\r\nsuggestion I would like to make in this regard is to\r\nproduce a pie chart that shows the percentage of the\r\nUnited Nations budget that goes to reducing global\r\npoverty and promoting development. That might\r\nclarify the picture and enable us to assess whether or\r\nnot there are sufficient resources going to development\r\nactivities.\r\nThe fifth possible reason for reform, one that I\r\nknow is a delicate issue, may be that the major\r\ncontributors are unhappy with the direction of the\r\nOrganization. Unfortunately, there is more than a grain\r\nof truth in this observation. In the past few years, the\r\nreform process has been driven by the major\r\ncontributors, who feel troubled by several different\r\ndimensions of the work of the United Nations. Indeed,\r\nas we heard in the statements made just this morning,\r\nthere is a troubling North-South differentiation on the\r\nissue of United Nations reform. In our view, that need\r\nnot be the case. It need not be the case that the North\r\nshould be supporting reform and the South should be\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nsuspicious. In our view, both the North and the South\r\ncan be equally enthusiastic about supporting reform.\r\nBut to achieve that, both the North and the South must\r\ndevelop a common mental framework of what the\r\nreform process is all about. We have got to be clear\r\nabout what the goals are and what we are trying to\r\nachieve. We must also be clear about how reform\r\nserves the interests of everyone in the United Nations\r\ncommunity — how it serves the North and how it\r\nserves the South. We hope that this will be one of the\r\noutcomes of this debate.\r\nBy the way, in that regard I would also like to\r\nmention and reinforce the point that was made in this\r\ndebate by the Ambassador of Tunisia, Noureddine\r\nMejdoub. About the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations he said that it “is also conditioned by capacity\r\nto know how to reconcile, or sometimes to restrain, our\r\nnational interests with, and for the sake of, the larger\r\ncommunity’s interest.” That is our challenge in today’s\r\ndebate. Can we, in an effort to strengthen the United\r\nNations, sometimes put aside our national interests for\r\nthe sake of strengthening collective interests? We hope\r\nthat this can be done.\r\nThere is one other point that I would like to touch\r\non before turning specifically to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. In one of our earlier statements in the\r\nHall regarding the revitalization of the Organization,\r\nwe said that the United Nations rests on the tripod\r\ncomprised of the Secretariat, the General Assembly and\r\nthe Security Council. The report before us today\r\nfrankly addresses in great detail the areas of reform\r\npertinent to the Secretariat. It also addresses in great\r\ndetail the areas of reform concerning the General\r\nAssembly. But there is little or no mention of the\r\nSecurity Council, even though the Council is today\r\nprobably the single most important member of the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nAfter having served almost two years on the\r\nSecurity Council, it is our observation that the Council\r\ncan also do with administrative reforms. I think that, as\r\nmany here have observed, we have tried to do that with\r\nthe Security Council’s annual report to the General\r\nAssembly, in an effort to try to trim its length. In fact,\r\nwe succeeded in cutting the report almost in half,\r\nsaving the United Nations a few hundred thousand\r\ndollars in the process.\r\nBut let me be candid. While we expected that all\r\nmembers of the Council would have supported us, we\r\nwere actually surprised to find that there was\r\nresistance. I can tell the Assembly that some of my\r\ncolleagues almost literally had to sweat blood to get\r\nsupport to do something that we thought was very\r\nobvious, namely, trimming the report. The tragedy is\r\nthat some of the States here supporting reform in the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Secretariat were resistant to\r\nreform in the Security Council. We think that if that\r\nbecomes known, it would undermine the process of\r\nreform.\r\nIt is important that all three elements of the\r\nUnited Nations family — the Secretariat, the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council — show an equal\r\ncommitment to reform. By the way, that is why we\r\nsupport paragraph 21 of the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nwhich concerns the need for the Security Council to\r\ncodify its practices. We also support paragraphs 168\r\nand 169, which deal with streamlining and the\r\npeacekeeping operations budget. Incidentally, we must\r\nremember that the budgets for peacekeeping operations\r\nare much larger than the regular budget. They, too,\r\nshould be scrutinized.\r\nLet me now turn to the report itself. We do want\r\nto commend the Secretary-General and, of course, the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General, for producing a concise and\r\nwell-written report. I also want to say that it is\r\neminently readable, as I read it over a weekend.\r\nI will state upfront that our delegation is in\r\nagreement with the analysis presented and with most, if\r\nnot all, of its 36 recommendations. Judging from the\r\ninterventions made during the discussions on the\r\nagenda item concerning the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, no one would disagree with the\r\nSecretary-General’s observation that the General\r\nAssembly remains weak. Frankly, the only question\r\nthat we cannot answer in this debate is where the\r\nleadership will come from in terms of improving the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Secretary-General cannot\r\nprovide that leadership. After all, he is a civil servant\r\nserving the Organization. If the General Assembly is to\r\nbe improved and revitalized, that leadership must come\r\nfrom Member States. If it does not come from Member\r\nStates, we then have to produce the leaders from the\r\nintergovernmental body to do so. We indeed hope that\r\nsome will emerge. But in terms of making suggestions\r\nabout how to make the Secretariat of the United\r\nNations a more efficient organization, there is no doubt\r\nthat the Secretary-General has come forward with\r\nmany important suggestions.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nWe would like to add that in this process the\r\nSecretariat and Member States should see themselves\r\nas being in a symbiotic partnership. There must be trust\r\non both sides. The Secretary-General is seeking more\r\nflexibility in implementing the mandates that we set.\r\nFor our part, Member States must take a pragmatic\r\napproach and resist the urge to micromanage the\r\nSecretariat. In other words, I believe that we should all\r\nwelcome the thrust of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals and not take issue with too many details.\r\nWhile there are bound to be some specific concerns, we\r\nshould not let this override the broader need for\r\nauthorizing the Secretary-General to take expeditious\r\naction with regard to continuing the reform effort he\r\nstarted in 1997.\r\nCertainly, there are several areas highlighted in\r\nthe report — particularly the sections on reforming the\r\nbudget process, human resources reform and the\r\nstrengthening human rights — that will require more\r\ndetailed information and further consideration by the\r\nGeneral Assembly. We trust that, as he did during\r\n1997, the Secretary-General will come up with an\r\nimplementation plan that addresses those issues\r\ncomprehensively.\r\nIn deciding how to proceed we must first be clear\r\nin our minds about which recommendations fall under\r\nthe Secretary-General’s authority as chief\r\nadministrative officer and which areas require General\r\nAssembly approval. We support him in immediately\r\nimplementing those that fall strictly within his\r\nmandate. As we will soon say in a speech at the Fourth\r\nCommittee, those include, for example, the efforts\r\nmade to revitalize DPI. In our view, there are perhaps\r\nonly four or five actions — particularly those dealing\r\nwith the budget — that will require action on our part.\r\nHaving said that, I hope that we in the Assembly\r\nwill take a strategic decision on the report, as requested\r\nby the Secretary-General. That would be the correct\r\napproach, which is not to say that the details are\r\nunimportant. However, they can be dealt with in due\r\ncourse at a later stage. We believe that our immediate\r\npriority right now should be to send a clear message of\r\nsupport to the Secretary-General.\r\nIn conclusion, let me quote the Italian Statesman\r\nNiccolò Machiavelli. I know that Machiavelli is not\r\nnecessarily quoted positively, but this is something he\r\nsaid that was positive: “Whoever desires constant\r\nsuccess must change his conduct with the times”. We\r\nhope that all three members of the United Nations\r\ntripod — the Secretariat, the General Assembly and the\r\nSecurity Council — will change with the times to\r\nensure that the United Nations remains relevant and\r\nstrong.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The future of the United Nations is uncertain.\r\nIts very existence is threatened by unilateralism. We\r\nmust save the United Nations. At the same, we must\r\ncarry out a thorough reform of the Organization that\r\nmakes a daily reality of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, which today is no more than a mirage. In our\r\nopinion, the essential goal of reform is the\r\ndemocratization of the United Nations, based on the\r\nfull respect of the Charter.\r\nHowever, as aptly stated by the Secretary-General\r\nin his valuable report (A/57/387), there has hardly been\r\nany progress in the reform and democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council, after a sterile decade of negotiations\r\nand despite an overwhelming majority that is in what\r\none representative called “general agreement” on the\r\nneed to increase the Council’s membership in order to\r\nremedy the under-representation of the developing\r\ncountries, on the urgency of eliminating or least\r\ntemporarily restricting the use of the anti-democratic\r\nand obsolete veto power and on the need for\r\ntransparency in the Council’s functioning, on behalf of\r\nall Member States, by replacing the secret\r\nconfabulations known as informal consultations and\r\nfinally adopting its eternally provisional rules of\r\nprocedure.\r\nThe most necessary and urgent element of the\r\nreform of the United Nations is the democratization of\r\nthe Security Council, whose lack of legitimacy and\r\neffectiveness, loss of credibility and double standards\r\nendanger the very existence of the Organization.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is\r\nalso a decisive element of genuine reform of the United\r\nNations. The United Nations will become more\r\ndemocratic and effective only when the General\r\nAssembly fully exercises its powers under the Charter.\r\nThe vast majority of the Member States demand this.\r\nBut, under the exclusionary, inequitable and untenable\r\ninternational order with which we are burdened, it is\r\ndifficult for the Assembly to formulate thorough and\r\neffective action based on our common goals and on the\r\nshared interests of those of us who champion\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nmultilateralism and who possess the strength of the\r\ngreat majority of votes.\r\nCuba also agrees that is necessary to create a\r\nUnited Nations that is more efficient and dynamic in\r\ncarrying out the purposes and principles of the Charter,\r\nin effectively carrying out the priorities of the United\r\nNations established by Member States and in\r\nresponding to the various challenges that today’s\r\ninternational situation imposes on Member States.\r\nThe reform of the Organization must be\r\ncomprehensive and not be fundamentally confined to\r\nthe administrative and managerial structure of the\r\nSecretariat. The reform must include all principal and\r\nsubsidiary organs and must democratize them. It must\r\ntake as its fundamental pillar the preservation of the\r\nuniversal, democratic and intergovernmental nature of\r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba considers that the report\r\nof the Secretary-General, complemented by the\r\nproposals from Member States upon consideration of\r\nthe report, is an appropriate basis for advancing that\r\nprocess.\r\nOur delegation believes that the new measures\r\nmust aim at implementing the priorities of the\r\nMillennium Declaration, as well as the outcome of\r\nother, equally important United Nations summits and\r\nconferences. In our opinion, the proposals put forward\r\nmust be complemented by other initiatives aimed at\r\npromoting other priorities agreed upon in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and at other conferences.\r\nSome such proposals are discussed in the report, while\r\nothers, lacking implementation measures, are not. Such\r\nis the case of the priorities related to the search for\r\npeace, security and disarmament; development and the\r\neradication of poverty; the protection of the\r\nenvironment and the promotion of sustainable\r\ndevelopment; and attention to the special needs of\r\nAfrica.\r\nWe hope that the reform measures will lead to\r\nprogress in promoting and strengthening the structures\r\nand activities of the United Nations and its funds and\r\nprogrammes to promote economic and social\r\ndevelopment, which have unfortunately been weakened\r\nand whose ever-limited resources have been reduced or\r\nreallocated towards other goals in recent years.\r\nThe General Assembly must identify measures to\r\nimprove the efficiency of management — such\r\nmeasures are within the competence of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral — and must support the immediate\r\nimplementation of those measures through the relevant\r\nmandates, decisions and resolutions of the General\r\nAssembly. The delegation of Cuba reiterates its\r\nconfidence in the Secretary-General and wishes him\r\nsuccess in this endeavour.\r\nAs was aptly suggested by the Secretary-General,\r\nit is the General Assembly’s task to decide which\r\nissues are within its competence and which belong to\r\nthe other principal and subsidiary organs. With respect\r\nto the intergovernmental process, it is also the\r\nAssembly’s task to rapidly establish effective\r\nparameters for the careful study of proposals and for\r\ntaking decisions on them without unnecessary delays.\r\nThe strengthening of the Assembly should begin\r\nprecisely with the effective and complete exercise of\r\nthe powers belong to it and to its subsidiary organs in\r\ndeciding on the reform proposals.\r\nThe new reform proposals reflect and deepen the\r\nvaried measures some of which were outlined or\r\nconsidered in 1997 and which reflect a delicate\r\nbalance. Some of them have been the subject of recent\r\ndecisions of the General Assembly and other organs,\r\nwhile agreement could not be reached on others. In that\r\nlast category are, among others, setting time limits on\r\nmandates by means of the budgetary process and the\r\nrationalization of intergovernmental consideration of\r\nprogramme and budgetary questions, the promotion of\r\na universal presence and the strengthening of activities\r\non the ground of the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, the integration of\r\nmechanisms for financing and planning operational\r\nactivities, selectiveness in publishing reports and\r\nelectronic access to documents. We believe that\r\nbecause of their implications, these questions require\r\ncareful study by the Assembly and other relevant\r\norgans before decision is taken.\r\nIn our opinion, the General Assembly and its\r\nsubsidiary bodies must work carefully, together with\r\nthe Secretary-General, to clarify and to decide on the\r\nscope and form of the implementation of some of the\r\nmeasures, whose overall appearance may appear\r\nattractive but whose real effects will depend on the\r\ninterpretation given to them and the actual context in\r\nwhich they are implemented.\r\nFor example, the proposals for shortening the\r\ntime period of the medium-term plan, for suppressing\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination, for\r\nmodifying and simplifying the budgetary process and\r\nfor creating more flexibility for reallocating resources\r\namong programmes and expenditure items are all\r\nmeasures that, due to their complexity and technical\r\nnature, must necessarily be studied by the relevant\r\nintergovernmental bodies.\r\nAs well, it seems that there is an attempt to\r\nredefine the priorities of the United Nations through\r\npreparing the upcoming budget based on one\r\ninterpretation of the Millennium Declaration, without\r\ntaking into account other relevant mandates such as the\r\noutcomes of equally important summits and\r\nconferences. Our delegation believes that this process\r\nmust maintain and reaffirm the validity and usefulness\r\nof principal instruments such as the medium-term plan\r\nand its revisions.\r\nAnother essential idea, in the view of the Cuban\r\ndelegation, is that of universality in the approach of\r\nrecommended actions, which must be implemented in\r\ntheir entirety, with a system-wide vision, by all organs\r\nor all Member States according to the specific case. For\r\nexample, with respect to the scope and system-wide\r\nperspective of actions 2, 4 and 5, perhaps we all agree\r\non the appropriateness mentioned in the report of\r\nstrengthening the capacity of Member States in the area\r\nof human rights. However, doubts arise when that is\r\nrelated to strengthening of United Nations actions at\r\nthe country level. And when those actions interact with\r\noperational activities for development and their\r\ncorresponding funds and programmes, it seems that the\r\nimplementation of such measures becomes limited to\r\ndeveloping countries and does not extend to\r\nindustrialized countries, where much remains to be\r\ndone at the national level to ensure the universal\r\nenjoyment of human rights. Furthermore, we should\r\ndefine more closely how the principle of consent would\r\nbe applied in mixing actions of different natures when\r\nthere are components of the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights mixed with the\r\noffices and funds which are of a distinct and\r\nintergovernmental nature.\r\nWith regard to the integrated approach of these\r\nmeasures, the question arises of how to reconcile the\r\nproposed strengthening of the management and of the\r\ncapacities of the High Commissioner’s Office — which\r\nwould appear to presuppose an increase of resources —\r\nwith the goal entrusted to the Secretary-General of\r\nreviewing the management of this component of the\r\nSecretariat with a view to simplifying and rationalizing\r\nthis machinery and its procedures within existing\r\ncapacities and resources. It would be premature, for\r\nexample, to take a position with regard to action 5\r\nbefore the report of the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices has been duly considered by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba agrees with our President\r\non the importance of the process of intergovernmental\r\nconsideration of this report, that it be transparent and\r\nparticipative. Cuba repeats its readiness to participate\r\nin it dynamically, flexibly and constructively.\r\nMr. Kjørven (Norway): I am honoured to be\r\nspeaking to the Assembly on such an important matter\r\nas strengthening the United Nations. The United\r\nNations is a cornerstone of Norwegian foreign and\r\ndevelopment policy. Experience has taught us that the\r\nbest way to promote peace and security, human rights\r\nand sustainable development is through multilateral\r\ncooperation. Effective multilateralism calls for a strong\r\nUnited Nations. Norway is therefore firmly committed\r\nto the efforts being undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to strengthen the United Nations.\r\nTwo years ago, the leaders of the world agreed on\r\na common vision for the new century and a set of\r\npriorities to be achieved by 2015. It is of great concern\r\nto us that we are already falling behind in meeting\r\nthese objectives, not least poverty reduction. It is also\r\nof concern to us that insufficient progress is being\r\nmade in meeting the broader objectives of the\r\nMillennium Declaration in areas such as human rights,\r\ndemocracy, good governance, conflict resolution and\r\nthe special needs of Africa. We need to heed the\r\nSecretary-General’s warning that unless we make\r\nprogress on a broader front, “the ringing words of the\r\nDeclaration will serve only as grim reminders of the\r\nhuman needs neglected and promises unmet”\r\n(A/57/270, para. 113).\r\nOur common objective is to make the United\r\nNations a more effective multilateral instrument for\r\npursuing the priorities set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. If we are to succeed in meeting the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, we must realize that\r\nwe are all responsible for their implementation. This\r\nresponsibility includes supporting and strengthening\r\nthe United Nations capability to move the process\r\nforward.\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.38\r\nThroughout his tenure, the Secretary-General has\r\nproven that he is committed to improving the United\r\nNations. We see his proposals as a logical follow-up to\r\nthe first reform process, started in 1997. We support\r\nthe proposal to focus the Organization’s attention on\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nfollowing up the recent world conferences.\r\nNorway welcomes the emphasis in the report on\r\nthe need to further strengthen the work on human rights\r\nwithin the United Nations, and we give this objective\r\nour full support. The promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights worldwide are a fundamental task of this\r\nOrganization. However, even though much progress\r\nhas been made, a lot still remains to be done before we\r\ncan truly say that human rights have been\r\nmainstreamed into the activities of the Organization.\r\nThis includes areas such as humanitarian affairs,\r\nconflict prevention and peacekeeping. It is not enough\r\nto pay lip service to an abstract idea of full integration.\r\nWe must continue to work on this, both in terms of our\r\nattitudes and in terms of our practical efforts. We are\r\nconfident that the Secretary-General’s proposed\r\nreforms will help us to achieve this aim.\r\nNorway strongly supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nemphasis on the importance of improving the\r\ncoordination of United Nations activities at the country\r\nlevel. This should come as no surprise. These are ideas\r\nthat have long been supported by Norway, and we think\r\nit is important that all United Nations activities are\r\nintegrated, particularly in countries emerging from\r\nconflict.\r\nWe look forward to the completion of the\r\nimplementation plan for the effective coordination\r\namong the various United Nations entities working in a\r\ngiven country by 2003. We see it as essential that that\r\nthe United Nations agencies, funds and programmes\r\nworking in each country are able to pool their\r\nresources and undertake joint programming. We\r\nwelcome the proposed strengthening of the role and\r\ncapacity of the Resident Coordinator, which in turn\r\nshould facilitate such an enhanced effort to achieve a\r\ntruly integrated United Nations country team.\r\nHowever, successful coordination in the field\r\nmust also include the major financial development\r\ninstitutions, mainly the IMF and the World Bank. There\r\nhas been an increase in cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Bretton Woods institutions in recent\r\nyears as regards the development of national poverty\r\nreduction strategies. We strongly encourage and\r\nsupport the continuation and strengthening of this\r\ncooperation.\r\nPublic outreach is important for any organization,\r\nand no less so for the United Nations. We therefore\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s proposals for\r\nstrengthening the United Nations public information\r\nactivities and believe that this will both enhance public\r\nsupport for the United Nations and further the\r\nOrganization’s legitimacy and authority as our\r\nforemost multilateral institution.\r\nIn recent years, the United Nations has also\r\nstrengthened its relationship with civil society and the\r\nprivate sector, recognizing the need to work together to\r\nachieve our common goals. We are pleased that the\r\nSecretary-General’s report includes proposals to\r\nstrengthen and organize the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and civil society and the private sector.\r\nReform is not about doing more with less or\r\nsaving money. It is about being able to live up to great\r\nexpectations by being efficient and focused, and with\r\nresources sufficient to do the job. The people of the\r\nworld look to the United Nations to help solve their\r\nproblems. We are responsible for providing the United\r\nNations with the capacity to do so.\r\nSince 1997, the Secretary-General has\r\nsuccessfully implemented reforms that were under his\r\ncompetence. However, we, the Member States, have\r\nnot done our share. We must reform the way we work\r\nin the General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in order to strengthen the United Nations as a\r\nwhole. We should all take note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals in this regard.\r\nThe United Nations can only be as strong and\r\nassertive as Governments make it. Norway is fully\r\ncommitted to giving its full support to the proposals set\r\nout in the Secretary-General’s report. We look forward\r\nto seeing them put into operation in the revised\r\nprogramme budget for the biennium 2004-2005. We\r\nurge all Member States to strongly endorse the\r\nSecretary-General’s Reform Initiative.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n"
