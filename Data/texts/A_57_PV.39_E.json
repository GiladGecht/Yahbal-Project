(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 52 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/387 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): Pakistan supports the\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations. His resolve to enhance the centrality of\r\nthe United Nations in international affairs reflects the\r\naspirations of the world’s peoples. The continuing\r\nprocess of reform and revitalization of our\r\nOrganization is essential to enable it to respond to the\r\nchallenges and opportunities of the new world that is\r\nemerging at the dawn of the twenty-first century.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s report\r\nentitled “Strengthening of the United Nations: an\r\nagenda for further change”. We hope that this debate\r\nwill help to shape an agreed and effective response to\r\nthe important proposals and recommendations\r\npresented in the report.\r\nBroadly, the report addresses three categories of\r\nissues. First, there are proposals that seek to streamline\r\nthe functioning of the Secretariat and strengthen the\r\nwork of the intergovernmental machinery. Such\r\nproposals should generally receive strong support from\r\nthe Assembly. A second category are those proposals\r\nwhich have an impact on intergovernmental processes.\r\nOn these, the Assembly should provide guidance to the\r\nSecretary-General, inter alia, through this debate. Then\r\nthere is a third category of issues which require either\r\nclarification from the Secretariat or adequate\r\nintergovernmental consideration to enable the\r\nevolution of broadly acceptable decisions.\r\nLet me explain Pakistan’s views on some of the\r\nmajor issues covered in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nWe agree that United Nations programmes and\r\nactions should reflect the current and emerging\r\npriorities of the Organization. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration presents an overarching vision which\r\nbroadly reflects these priorities. However, it is\r\ninevitable that in a rapidly globalizing world, problems\r\nand priorities will continue to change and evolve.\r\nWe are glad that the Secretary-General has\r\nclarified that the priorities mentioned in his report\r\nreflect only an illustrative and not an exhaustive list.\r\nWe believe that a broader and balanced list of priorities\r\nshould be identified through this debate and the\r\nensuing informal consultations for appropriate\r\nreflection in our decisions.\r\nThere is an obvious need to rationalize and\r\nstreamline the human rights machinery of the United\r\nNations. Action is required at least at three levels.\r\nFirst, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights needs to be\r\nconsiderably overhauled. We need to ensure that the\r\nfunding of various human rights activities of the Office\r\nreflect the priorities set by Member States, and\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nespecially by the Commission on Human Rights.\r\nUnited Nations human rights programmes should\r\nnormally all be financed through the regular budget.\r\nThe balance between the promotion of civil and\r\npolitical and economic and social rights, including the\r\nright to development, needs to be promoted and\r\nmaintained. Balance also needs to be introduced in the\r\ncomposition of the personnel of the Office of the High\r\nCommissioner.\r\nSecondly, the numerous human rights\r\nmechanisms also need to be streamlined. At present\r\nthere are about 30 special rapporteurs and\r\nrepresentatives established by the Commission. The\r\nmandates of many of those mechanisms overlap, and\r\nevery special rapporteur apparently seeks to cover\r\nevery nook and cranny of the mandate he is assigned.\r\nLengthy reports by the special rapporteurs are not\r\nsubjected to any in-depth examination; nor do they\r\nevoke genuine dialogue. The Commission on Human\r\nRights should be asked to recommend how these\r\nspecial mechanisms, which have proliferated, can be\r\nreduced in number and enhanced in efficiency and\r\nrelevance.\r\nThirdly, the promotion of human rights at the\r\ncountry level needs to be pursued in a well-considered\r\nway. The introduction of human rights officers into\r\nUnited Nations country offices is not the best way to\r\ndo that. Since such country offices exist mostly in the\r\ndeveloping countries, it will reinforce the impression\r\nthat human rights problems exist only in the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nWe support the restructuring of the Department of\r\nPublic Information (DPI). The priority themes, from\r\nwhich will emerge the key United Nations messages,\r\nshould be determined by the Committee on\r\nInformation, not by DPI. We are not convinced of the\r\nviability of creating regional hubs — at least, not in\r\nsome regions. In the first instance, the Committee on\r\nInformation should formulate broad guidelines and\r\ncriteria, to be applied in each region, bearing in mind\r\nthe region’s particularities.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s proposal in\r\nsection III to reduce the number of reports and\r\nmeetings. The vast proliferation of both has overtaken\r\nthe absorptive capabilities of small and even medium-\r\nsized delegations and is undermining the\r\nrepresentational value of our deliberations and\r\ndecisions. We trust that the production of concise\r\nreports will not take place at the cost of ensuring\r\npolitical balance or excluding issues in areas of\r\nimportance to the developing countries.\r\nWe support, in principle, the steps proposed in\r\nsection IV to improve field coordination. For the\r\ncommon programming suggested in action 14, it would\r\nbe advisable to seek the views of the relevant United\r\nNations agencies and countries concerned. We support\r\nthe enhanced responsibility being given to the Adviser\r\nfor Special Assignments in Africa.\r\nWe would welcome the preparation and\r\nsubmission to the Economic and Social Council of a\r\ndocument clarifying the roles and responsibilities of\r\nvarious United Nations technical assistance\r\nprogrammes, with a view to their rationalization.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposal to organize the\r\nrelationship of the United Nations with civil society is\r\na timely and important initiative. Civil society is\r\nplaying an increasingly important role in economic and\r\nsocial development, governance and peace and security\r\nissues. However, the number of civil society\r\norganizations has increased exponentially in recent\r\nyears. Not all organizations are of the same quality and\r\ncredibility. To avail itself of their contribution, the\r\nUnited Nations needs to evaluate in greater depth the\r\nstrengths and expertise of each organization and create\r\nmechanisms through which their contributions in\r\nrelevant areas can be best obtained. We recommend\r\nthat the Committee on Non-governmental\r\nOrganizations of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nmeeting at the level of permanent representative,\r\nshould propose guidelines and actions for this purpose.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s dissatisfaction\r\nwith the planning and budgetary process of the United\r\nNations. We are not fully convinced, however, that the\r\nsolution proposed in the report is the best one. The\r\npresent planning and budgetary process has worked\r\nfairly well for many years. The Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination (CPC), which is a\r\nsubsidiary body of both the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, looks at the medium-\r\nterm plan (MTP) from a programmatic perspective so\r\nas to ensure that the proposed programmes correspond\r\nto the mandates given by intergovernmental bodies.\r\nThis is an extremely important role and serves as a\r\ncheck on the possible misinterpretation of\r\nintergovernmental mandates. The weakness is not the\r\nresult of the process. It arises from the fact that\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nrepresentation on the CPC has not been of a level\r\nconducive to examination of the MTP from a policy\r\nperspective. The MTP has also, traditionally, been a\r\nlong document, and tedious to read and absorb. If we\r\ncan ensure a more concise and strategic MTP, coupled\r\nwith higher level participation in the CPC — for\r\nexample, at the level of senior officials or permanent\r\nrepresentatives — we would not need to overturn a\r\ntried and tested system in favour of a new and as yet\r\nunclear arrangement.\r\nThere may be other options that could serve the\r\npurpose, for example, making the CPC an expert body\r\nalong the same lines as the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions. The Pakistani\r\ndelegation proposes that this issue be discussed by an\r\nopen-ended working group, meeting at the level of\r\npermanent representatives, assisted by experts, during\r\nthe course of the fifty-seventh session, with a view to\r\ntaking a decision at the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. With regard to human resource\r\nmanagement, discussed in section VI of the report,\r\nPakistan supports, in principle, measures which\r\npromote efficiency in the Secretariat and help to create\r\na versatile and well-managed workforce employed on\r\nthe basis of merit and competence and with due regard\r\nto geographical balance.\r\nWe understand that following this debate, Mr.\r\nPresident, you intend to hold informal discussions to\r\ndraw up a draft resolution which will provide the\r\nSecretary-General with the strategic guidance he has\r\nsought from the General Assembly. The draft\r\nresolution to be adopted at this stage should\r\nincorporate the Assembly’s responses to the different\r\nkinds of actions proposed in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport. We look forward to your suggestion, Sir, about\r\nthe mechanism you wish to use in proceeding to\r\nelaborate the decision of the General Assembly. We are\r\nconfident that under your able leadership the process of\r\nnegotiation will be transparent and inclusive, and\r\nensure appropriate reflection of the views expressed by\r\nMember States in this debate.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): My\r\ndelegation would like to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral very highly for initiating the debate on this\r\nimportant item, entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations system”. We also thank the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his role in respect of the report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change”, which is contained in document\r\nA/57/387. In that relatively short but concise report,\r\nwhich has helped to save a great deal in financial\r\nterms, she and her team have presented to the General\r\nAssembly a series of suggestions with the aim of\r\nmaking this Organization stronger and more effective\r\nso that it can achieve the goals set forth in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. Our delegation welcomes the\r\nreport and wishes to make some observations on\r\ncertain aspects of it.\r\nThe need for a strong and effective United\r\nNations is becoming increasingly imperative in this\r\ncentury. It is obvious that the goals set out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration cannot be successfully pursued\r\nwithout strengthening the Organization. The reform\r\nprocess aimed at further rationalizing the structure of\r\nthe United Nations, therefore, should be continued and\r\naccelerated. My delegation pledges its total support for\r\nthe enhancement of the Organization’s backbone\r\norgans, especially the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nAs far as the General Assembly is concerned, we\r\nsupport recent steps aimed at improving its working\r\nmethods, such as the decision to elect the President and\r\nthe Vice-Presidents of the Assembly, as well as the\r\nofficers of the Main Committees, three months before\r\nthe beginning of the regular session, or the practice of\r\ndiscussing interlinked items together during plenary\r\nmeetings and meetings of the Main Committees.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council, we fully\r\nagree with the report that no reform of the United\r\nNations would be complete without reform of the\r\nCouncil. It is no secret that that organ should be more\r\naccountable to the General Assembly, more\r\nrepresentative to reflect today’s reality — through the\r\nexpansion of both the non-permanent and permanent\r\ncategories of its membership — and more democratic\r\nand more transparent in its working methods. While\r\ntaking note of the improvements in the Council’s\r\nworking methods, such as the increased number of\r\nopen meetings with the participation of non-Council\r\nmembers, we regret that the Open-ended Working\r\nGroup on Security Council Reform has been unable to\r\nmake any progress after a decade of discussion, leaving\r\nthe painful impression that it is beating a dead horse.\r\nTwo years ago, the leaders of United Nations\r\nMember States defined the following as our priorities:\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\n“the fight for development for all the peoples of\r\nthe world, the fight against poverty, ignorance\r\nand disease; the fight against injustice; the fight\r\nagainst violence, terror and crime; and the fight\r\nagainst the degradation ... of our common home.”\r\n(A/RES/55/2, para. 29)\r\nUndoubtedly, those priorities should be at the top of the\r\nUnited Nations agenda and our principal activities.\r\nAlthough the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development, held at Monterrey, and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held at\r\nJohannesburg, have somehow lived up to our\r\nexpectations, we need more concrete actions and\r\nmeasures. We also need a mechanism to coordinate\r\ndevelopment efforts on a global scale to enable\r\ndeveloping countries to take advantage of all the\r\nopportunities that globalization offers, especially with\r\nregard to trade and investment, and to ensure their\r\ngreater involvement in the decision-making process.\r\nIn that context, we find that section II of the\r\nreport, entitled “Doing what matters”, appears\r\nsomewhat unbalanced, since many vital issues — such\r\nas those of development and poverty eradication —\r\nhave not been given the attention envisaged in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, while certain other issues\r\nhave been singled out and addressed through very\r\nspecific and concrete actions.\r\nConcerning the organization of work of the\r\nSecretariat, it should be noted that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has proposed a large number of measures to\r\nthat effect, such as streamlining reports, improving the\r\nplanning of meetings, coordinating the activities of the\r\nSecretaries of the Main Committees, restructuring\r\nUnited Nations Information Centres, improving United\r\nNations libraries and improving document\r\nmanagement. My delegation is of the view that any\r\nreform in the direction of streamlining, rooting out\r\nredundancies and duplications, is to be encouraged and\r\nsupported, provided that it does not involve financial\r\nimplications and that concerns raised by Member\r\nStates are adequately addressed.\r\nLastly but not least, my delegation shares the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that the competence of staff\r\nensures their vital contributions to the success of the\r\nOrganization. We note with satisfaction that the\r\nSecretary- General is committed to the recruitment of\r\nqualified candidates from unrepresented or\r\nunderrepresented countries. In that respect, we should\r\nlike to see concrete measures to rectify the existing\r\nunbalanced recruiting mechanism.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to express my\r\ndelegation’s highest appreciation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to make the United Nations a stronger\r\nand more effective instrument in the service of people\r\naround the world. I assure him of my delegation’s full\r\ncooperation and support, and I sincerely hope to\r\nwarmly welcome him to Viet Nam sometime next year.\r\nMr. Kasemsarn (Thailand): I should like to\r\nbegin by adding my voice to all those who have spoken\r\nbefore me in expressing our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for sharing with us his thoughts and\r\nplans in his report on strengthening of the United\r\nNations system (A/57/387). I also wish to thank Ms.\r\nLouise Fréchette, Deputy Secretary-General, for giving\r\nMember countries further details on the issues raised in\r\nthe report.\r\nThe report provides us with a broad overview of\r\nhow the Secretary-General intends to bring about\r\nchanges and improvement with regard to the\r\nSecretariat so that it can better serve the Organization\r\nand its Member States. It also raises some challenging\r\nquestions regarding the revitalization of United Nations\r\nintergovernmental bodies with respect not only to their\r\nworking methods but also to their relevance and\r\neffectiveness in dealing with the myriad challenges of\r\nthe globalized world. Those thoughts and plans will\r\ncertainly serve us well as we review the reform process\r\nof the entire Organization. Our debate today on this\r\nitem is thus timely and significant, and it should also\r\nbe viewed in the wider context of the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council and of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation commends the Secretary-General\r\nfor pursuing this matter as one of his top priorities\r\nwhen he took office as chief executive of the\r\nOrganization in 1997. Indeed, he has initiated many\r\nvaluable improvements in the performance and\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations by reshaping,\r\nreorganizing and consolidating the Secretariat.\r\nThailand welcomes those initiatives and will continue\r\nto support his efforts to bring about further\r\nimprovements at the United Nations.\r\nWe believe that, as a universal multilateral\r\ninstitution, the United Nations needs to evolve with the\r\nchanging times and landscape in order to remain\r\neffective and relevant. The Organization’s reform\r\nprocess should be implemented with full consideration\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nof the aspirations and expectations of Member States,\r\nas well as of the various levels of development among\r\nthem. My delegation should therefore like to offer\r\nsome of our thoughts and ideas on ways to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the Organization.\r\nFirst, it is my delegation’s view that the\r\nMillennium Declaration and the major international\r\nConferences of the past decade should serve as the road\r\nmap for the United Nations in the elaboration of its\r\nprogramme of work. A thorough review of United\r\nNations activities is needed to ensure that the\r\nOrganization is properly focused on tackling urgent\r\nissues, such as globalization and its impact on\r\ndevelopment, poverty eradication, HIV/AIDS, human\r\nrights, the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking,\r\nand conflict prevention, and that it is able to produce\r\ntangible results. My delegation therefore hopes that the\r\nSecretary-General can offer a more comprehensive\r\nreview of the Organization, taking into account these\r\npriority issues, so that its strengths and weaknesses can\r\nbe assessed.\r\nSecondly, Thailand welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s plan to bring about greater coherence,\r\nefficiency and effectiveness among the various United\r\nNations agencies and programmes in host countries.\r\nWe support the idea of developing a common pooling\r\nof resources, joint programming, common databases\r\nand knowledge networks among the agencies and\r\nprogrammes without significant impact on the existing\r\nbudget allocations. This approach is similar to the Thai\r\nGovernment’s concept of chief executive officer for the\r\nadministration of its public organizations abroad,\r\nwhich involves, inter alia, pooling resources and\r\nencouraging teamwork under a unified structure and\r\ncommand.\r\nThirdly, Thailand is of the opinion that the\r\nSecretary-General’s plan to increase resources in real\r\nterms, aside from adjustments arising from inflation\r\nand currency changes, for the revised programme\r\nbudget starting from the period 2002-2003, may not be\r\nfeasible at this time. A number of developing and least-\r\ndeveloped countries are still in the process of\r\nrecovering from the financial crises of the late 1990s\r\nand, indeed, a few others are experiencing financial\r\nand economic difficulties at the moment. The principle\r\nof the capacity to pay of developing and least-\r\ndeveloped countries, which make up the majority of the\r\nMembers of this Organization, must be taken into\r\naccount in all the deliberations on this issue. The\r\napproach we should be taking on this issue is to\r\nexamine how to increase budget savings through\r\nreforms so that they can be used to maintain future\r\nprogramme budgets at the current level.\r\nFourthly, the Secretary-General’s proposal to\r\nimprove planning and budgeting systems by\r\nsynchronizing the medium-term plan with the biennial\r\nproposed programme budget to cover two years seems\r\npragmatic and sensible. This is also the case with\r\nregard to the Secretary-General’s request for more\r\nflexibility in the reallocation of resources between\r\nprogrammes of up to 10 per cent within a single\r\nbudgetary period. Thailand hopes that such measures\r\nwill lead to better financial management of the\r\nOrganization. We also support the proposed plan to\r\nimprove and simplify the planning and budgeting\r\nsystems of regular and peacekeeping budgets, as well\r\nas voluntary trust funds, which are the main resources\r\nin implementing the Organization’s programme of\r\nwork.\r\nLastly, the issue of the human resources of the\r\nOrganization is a matter of great interest and concern\r\nto all delegations. We fully support the mechanisms\r\nand incentives to improve the efficiency of human\r\nresources, particularly in the recruitment, promotion\r\nand remuneration processes. We also support the\r\nsuggestion to abolish the restrictions on the number of\r\nGeneral Service staff eligible for promotion to the\r\nProfessional category and to raise the annual quota of\r\nP-2 posts available for successful G-to-P exam\r\ncandidates to 25 per cent. My delegation hopes to see\r\nthese suggestions implemented at the earliest\r\nopportunity without any restriction on or\r\ndiscrimination among any qualified General Service\r\nstaff.\r\nAt this crucial period of changes and\r\nuncertainties, the United Nations, as a universal\r\nmultilateral institution, represents the best hope of\r\nhumanity for a more peaceful, caring and prosperous\r\nworld. The ability of the Organization to live up to the\r\nexpectations of the international community will\r\ndepend on two important ingredients. One is the ability\r\nand readiness of the Secretariat, with its body of highly\r\ncompetent professional staff, to change and adapt to the\r\never-increasing demands placed on it. The other is the\r\nfirm commitment of Member countries to support and\r\ncontribute to the work of the Organization, which\r\nshould be practical and commensurate with their\r\nlimited resources. These two ingredients must\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\ncomplement one another in order for the United\r\nNations to remain relevant in these challenging times\r\nand to become an agent for more effective change in\r\nthe service of humanity. Thailand remains steadfast in\r\nits support for a more effective and relevant United\r\nNations and will continue to play its part to achieve\r\nthis end.\r\nMr. Rivas (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Allow\r\nme at the outset to thank the Secretary-General for\r\nintroducing his report. No item among those before the\r\nUnited Nations will be successful if we do not seek\r\ndaily to strengthen the United Nations. That is why\r\nColombia welcomes the report, which proposes a path\r\nto be followed and establishes a series of measures to\r\nbe undertaken by the Secretary-General and by the\r\nmain organs of the United Nations, particularly the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation recognizes the Organization’s\r\nachievements in recent years on a broad spectrum of\r\nitems. The leadership of the United Nations has been\r\nessential in making progress on such goals as the\r\neradication of poverty and the fight against the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, as well as for the success of\r\nsome peacekeeping operations, such as those in Sierra\r\nLeone, Kosovo and Timor-Leste.\r\nHowever, in order to make definitive progress in\r\nall areas of concern to the Organization and effectively\r\nto solve all the problems confronting the international\r\ncommunity today, we need a greater commitment from\r\nthe Member States to the United Nations. We must\r\nconsider and apply such bold and ambitious ideas as\r\nthose put forward by the Secretary-General to\r\nstrengthen the Organization. We need to revitalize its\r\nmain organs and to make them more efficient by\r\naligning them with the realities of our peoples.\r\nWhile the United Nations faces serious problems\r\ntoday, such as the weakening of multilateralism and the\r\nadministrative and bureaucratic difficulties typical of a\r\ntruly global Organization, there is no doubt that our\r\npeoples see the United Nations as a solid and\r\nrespectable institution that responds, within its means,\r\nto the challenges it faces and that has incorporated into\r\nits field of action the contribution of various\r\ninternational State actors. Their views greatly revitalize\r\nand enrich the discussions on and search for solutions\r\nto the sensitive problems and issues on the global\r\nagenda.\r\nHowever, a great deal remains to be done. That is\r\nwhy Colombia is participating and will continue to\r\nparticipate actively in informal open-ended\r\nconsultations and groups to consider the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals. We will study the means put\r\nforward by the Secretary-General within his field of\r\ncompetence. We will promote the measures suggested\r\nby the Secretary-General and others that we consider to\r\nbe useful to the revitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nA forum such as the General Assembly, whose\r\nuniversality and membership make it extremely\r\nimportant, must overcome the difficulties afflicting it\r\ntoday: the overlapping of items, repetitious and sterile\r\ndebates and the negotiation of resolutions with little\r\npolitical impact, among others.\r\nAnother fundamental aspect that Member States\r\nmust address in the process of strengthening the United\r\nNations is reform of the Security Council in terms of\r\nboth its methods of work and its membership.\r\nColombia will continue to promote this process with a\r\nview to making the Security Council more\r\nrepresentative in its membership and more flexible in\r\nits working methods.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General has presented\r\na list of 36 actions or measures aimed at addressing the\r\nchallenges arising from the shortcomings detected in\r\nthe functioning of the Organization. The informal\r\nconsultations that have begun on this item will provide\r\nthe opportunity to refer to each of these actions in\r\ngreater detail. Allow me for the time being to reiterate\r\nmy delegation’s willingness to consider and promote\r\nthe reforms required by the United Nations, to which\r\nour peoples and Governments have assigned the\r\ndifficult task of maintaining peace and security, solving\r\nthe major problems on the international agenda,\r\npreserving the environment and promoting the\r\neconomic and social development of humankind.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At\r\nthe outset, I would like to say how much we in Kuwait\r\nappreciate the outstanding efforts that Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan is making to strengthen the role of\r\nthe United Nations, to ensure its effectiveness, to make\r\nit dynamic and flexible in dealing with international\r\nchanges and challenges and to enhance its ability to\r\nface up to those challenges, in line with the\r\nexpectations of people the world over.\r\nMy delegation has studied the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/57/387) on the item under\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nconsideration, “Strengthening of the United Nations\r\nSystem”. The report sets out actions that constitute the\r\nsecond phase of the reform strategy that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral initiated when he assumed office in 1997. We\r\nalso appreciate the Secretary-General’s interest in the\r\nviews of States on the issue. This important issue\r\nincludes matters affecting our daily work at\r\nHeadquarters. It must be considered carefully and\r\nappropriate agreed action should be taken in order to\r\nimplement the measures proposed in the report.\r\nLet me say, before discussing in detail the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on reform, that Kuwait\r\nbelieves that it is important for us to reach agreement\r\non the general principles to guide our approach in\r\ndealing with this issue. First, the reform process must\r\nbe continuous and uninterrupted. It must take into\r\nconsideration the principle of flexibility in formulating\r\nand implementing reform measures. Secondly, the\r\nviewpoints of all Member States must be considered on\r\nan equal footing. Actions ought to be debated in\r\nkeeping with the principle of transparency.\r\nThirdly, we believe that the reform process is a\r\ncollective responsibility to be shared between the\r\nSecretariat and Member States. Here, we underline the\r\nSecretariat’s principal role in drawing the attention of\r\nStates to issues and questions on which reform\r\nmeasures would be to everyone’s benefit. We believe\r\nthat frank interaction and dialogue between the\r\nSecretariat and Member States ought to be the method\r\nfor approaching this issue.\r\nFourthly, the key factor to success in reform\r\nefforts is to take quick measures to implement without\r\ndelay agreed reform proposals, and to postpone action\r\non those issues not yet agreed upon.\r\nThe fifth principle is renewed belief that the\r\nUnited Nations is an intergovernmental Organization\r\nwhose objective is to serve the peoples of the world.\r\nTherefore, the reform process must take into\r\nconsideration the political dimensions of all issues. We\r\nbelieve that the reform process must be in line with the\r\npolitical reality of the positions of Member States. We\r\ndo not believe that the corporate profit-making method\r\ncan succeed in reforming an Organization such as the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIf we were to agree on those general principles,\r\nwe could then base our work on them when we debate\r\nthe technical details of the reform process proposed in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report under consideration.\r\nHere, I propose that the President of the General\r\nAssembly concentrate first and foremost on action to\r\nbe taken and on the approach to be adopted for\r\nconsultations. Allow me to propose the following\r\npoints in that regard: informal consultations could be\r\nheld during which all the proposals contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report would be debated under an\r\nagenda set up for each meeting. Actions to be debated\r\nwould be organized under the main headings of the\r\nreport. Member States would be allowed to express\r\ntheir views on the technical aspects of each action. We\r\nwould thus see which proposals enjoy the general\r\nagreement of Member States.\r\nSecondly, Mr. President, you could follow up\r\nthose meetings and debates through representatives\r\nwhom you would appoint to assist you and pinpoint\r\nthose measures and proposals that enjoy general\r\nagreement among Member States. These could\r\nsubsequently be incorporated into a draft resolution for\r\nadoption and implementation as soon as Member States\r\nhad completed their consultations on them.\r\nThirdly, I would propose that once the positions\r\nof States as expressed during the debate on the item\r\nhave been analyzed, the proposals in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report should be catogorized and listed to\r\nmake it easier to deal with them through the draft\r\nresolution and subsequent action on the proposals.\r\nFollowing a quick examination of the nature of\r\nthe proposals in the report, my delegation believes that\r\nthey can be divided as follows. The first category\r\nincludes actions related to the prerogatives of the\r\nSecretary-General: ones he can take without\r\nascertaining the views of Member States. Nevertheless,\r\nit is important for such actions to be included in any\r\ndraft resolution to be adopted so that they can receive\r\nthe blessing of Member States. The second category\r\nincludes proposals related to urgent issues on which\r\ngeneral agreement has been expressed by Member\r\nStates in the debate. These include issues related to\r\nstreamlining the work of the General Assembly, and to\r\ndecreasing the number of reports and meetings by\r\nUnited Nations bodies. The third category includes\r\ntechnical proposals to be debated in the relevant\r\ntechnical bodies by members of those bodies and by\r\nother concerned Member States. The fourth category\r\nincludes measures which, for the time being, have been\r\nset aside, and on which no urgent action can be taken.\r\nThese include strategic issues and those related to the\r\nphilosophy of the work of the United Nations. These\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nrequire in-depth study and Member States must be\r\ngiven sufficient time to consider them without adopting\r\nany action on them. Some examples are the role of civil\r\nsociety, partnership with the private sector, how to deal\r\nwith United Nations staff members suffering from\r\nHIV/AIDS, measures regarding the Department of\r\nPublic Information and other measures of great interest\r\nto all Member States. My delegation will contribute\r\neffectively and positively to the consultations to be\r\nheld soon on the item. That will be an opportunity for\r\nus to clearly express our position on all measures\r\nproposed, particularly the ones my delegation supports\r\nand agrees with. First, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s ideas on a comprehensive approach to taking\r\nup items on the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, we fully support all measures and proposals\r\nto alleviate the burden on Member States with small\r\ndelegations and on the Secretariat, namely by reducing\r\nthe number of meetings and reports and simplifying the\r\nworking methods of all United Nations bodies,\r\nparticularly the General Assembly. I call on the\r\nAssembly to adopt measures on those issues in a timely\r\nmanner. Thirdly, we support strengthening the\r\nefficiency and capabilities of the United Nations staff\r\nwithout discrimination, considering that they are\r\ninternational civil servants, particularly General\r\nService staff.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to pay tribute to the\r\nSecretariat for measures taken in cooperation with\r\nMember States to streamline the activities of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The fruits of those efforts are\r\nalready being enjoyed at this very session. We believe\r\nthey are an example to be followed when taking up the\r\nSecretary-General’s proposals contained in the report\r\nunder consideration today.\r\nAt the same time, we must stress that our main\r\nobjective is to continue consolidating the concept of a\r\nUnited Nations culture, which we have included in all\r\nschool curricula in Kuwait. It is a concept that drives\r\nus — Member States or Secretariat employees, the true\r\nface of the Organization in the eyes of the peoples and\r\nGovernments of the world — to achieve reform in the\r\nservice of all.\r\nMr. Pradhan (Bhutan): We must be sensitive to\r\nthe fact that the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury is a truly universal organization. In the\r\nfulfilment of this most crucial role and its Charter\r\nobligations, the United Nations is called upon to deal\r\nwith multifarious issues. Those relate to peace and\r\nsecurity, social welfare, the environment, sustainable\r\neconomic development, poverty alleviation and a host\r\nof other issues that will impact our planet and the\r\nfuture of humankind for generations to come. That is\r\nindeed an onerous undertaking and responsibility. As\r\ndiverse as the membership of this world body is, so is\r\nthe agenda with which it is compelled to deal.\r\nWe need a United Nations that is inherently\r\ndynamic in its functioning. After all, the international\r\nissues that it is required to consider and deal with are\r\never changing and ever evolving. In such\r\ncircumstances, an outdated structure cannot cope with\r\nthe challenges of the times, and the bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations need reforms from time to time to face\r\nthose new situations.\r\nAs mentioned by speakers before me, small\r\ndelegations, especially those that have difficult\r\nmanpower and financial positions, find it impossible to\r\ncope with the large number of meetings and the piles of\r\ndocuments that emanate from the United Nations. That\r\nmatter has been noted in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nin paragraphs 23 and 88. While meetings and\r\ndocuments are essential features of our work, the sheer\r\nvolume of reports and the number of meetings are\r\nsimply overwhelming. The question that we must pose\r\nis, have those reports and meetings served their\r\nlegitimate and intended purposes? There is a need to\r\nclosely and objectively look into that matter, and see\r\nhow that untenable situation has come about and what\r\nthe Member States and the Secretariat need to do to\r\nrectify the situation.\r\nIn paragraph 24, the Secretary-General stated that\r\n“Summit fatigue has set in”, and, in a way, that is true.\r\nIn the past, my delegation has cautioned against\r\nconvening summit level meetings on too many issues\r\nor on matters on which the international community\r\nhas not reached the stage when a summit becomes\r\njustified. In addition, summit decisions are not fully\r\nand properly implemented, making the credibility of\r\nsummits questionable in the eyes of Governments and\r\nthe general public. Any proposal for a summit should\r\nbe carefully considered. Guidelines and criteria need to\r\nbe established and an adequate period of time must be\r\ntaken to access the requirement for a summit. There\r\nshould be sound and credible reasons for involving the\r\nhighest levels of our Governments. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral might like to give his recommendations on the\r\ncriteria for calling summits. I am sure that this will be\r\nhelpful to Member States in taking suitable decisions.\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nAn issue of critical importance in strengthening\r\nthe United Nations system is the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil, which is long overdue. The Council must be\r\nmade inclusive and democratic, and must also reflect\r\nthe aspirations of the Member countries that were not\r\nthere and not involved in setting up the Organization in\r\n1945, over half a century ago. Many debates have\r\ntaken place for nearly a decade on the need to reform\r\nthis major organ, and yet proposals for substantive\r\nchange have met with adamant resistance. The\r\npermanent, as well as the non-permanent, membership\r\nhas to be expanded to reflect the universality of the\r\nUnited Nations. The issue of continuing with the veto\r\npower also deserves further and careful consideration.\r\nThe matter of financing the activities of the\r\nUnited Nations has been of great concern to Member\r\nStates. On the one hand, Member States, whether it is\r\nin the Fifth Committee and the General Assembly or in\r\nthe Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions and other concerned bodies, still\r\ndo not seem to be able to exercise the degree of control\r\nfelt necessary on the part of financial experts. That has\r\nresulted in many differences of opinion and\r\nmisunderstandings between the Secretariat and the\r\nMember States, but this situation is a serious problem\r\nthat needs to be addressed more realistically. The\r\ncurrent system of control, review, checks and balances\r\nwill have to be reformed in a manner that will give\r\ngreater confidence to Member States and, at the same\r\ntime, will enable the Secretary-General to function\r\nbetter financially.\r\nThe other point concerns the regular contributions\r\nof Member States based on their respective gross\r\nnational product. In view of the diverse nature of the\r\nOrganization’s membership, there is no option but to\r\nmaintain the current methods of financing for the\r\nregular budget. But all Member States must live up to\r\ntheir expectations and not create problems to pressure\r\nthe international Organization.\r\nThat situation notwithstanding, the greatest\r\nproblem is voluntary contributions needed to finance\r\nthe activities of the United Nations. From a long-term\r\nperspective, it would be good to look seriously at the\r\nprospects for increasing, even if gradually, forms of\r\nindependent financing for the United Nations in which\r\nnational decisions become less relevant. There have\r\nalready been some proposals on this. A more vigorous\r\npursuit in this direction would serve the international\r\ncommunity well. The Secretariat needs to look into this\r\nand advise Member States on the course of action that\r\nneeds to be initiated.\r\nAs several speakers before me have expressed, in\r\nthe reform process to be carried out by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the question of representation of all Member\r\nStates in the recruitment process has to be given added\r\nemphasis. Where they cannot put forward candidates or\r\nhave no interest in doing so, then it is a different\r\nmatter. But we must bear in mind that this is an\r\ninternational Organization, composed of 191 Members,\r\nand the character of the United Nations Secretariat and\r\nits bodies must and should reflect this reality.\r\nUnfortunately, proposals such as these are usually\r\ncountered by arguments that this results in recruitment\r\nof mediocre third world personnel. Yes, there would be\r\ncultural differences, varied methods of working, and\r\nlinguistic and other issues. But the United Nations\r\nrecruitment process should be such that, leaving aside\r\ncultural and linguistic differences, which are obvious in\r\na universal multilateral setting, only qualified persons\r\nare recruited whether from developed or developing\r\ncountries.\r\nI have taken the opportunity to address a few of\r\nthe many points in the Secretary-General’s report. My\r\ndelegation takes this opportunity to commend Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan for the initiatives that he has taken in the reform\r\nof the United Nations. We thank him for the positive\r\nsuggestions made and are confident that the report will\r\nbe a most useful input in our efforts to bring about\r\nnecessary reforms in this universal Organization.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile)(spoke in Spanish): I wish to\r\nbegin by expressing our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his colleagues for the report on the reform\r\nof the United Nations that we are discussing today. I\r\nalso wish to express at the outset our resolute support\r\nto the proposals submitted to us. We wish also to\r\nexpress our intention to contribute as far as possible to\r\nthe promotion of vast support for the agenda for change\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General and make a\r\ncontribution to the debate by introducing new ideas and\r\nimprovements that will add to its success.\r\nIn our opinion there are many reasons that make\r\nit necessary to give unrestricted support for the effort\r\nthat the Secretariat is proposing to us. First of all, there\r\nis the quality and the very contents of the report, which\r\nrespond, as pointed out in its introduction, to a new\r\nway of working within the United Nations. Of equal\r\nimportance, we feel, is the fact that the report reflects\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nrequirements and agreements which are of long\r\nstanding for Member States. This is an excellent\r\nexample of the possibility for cooperation between\r\nGovernments and the Secretariat, with a view to\r\nrevitalizing the Organization.\r\nWe also believe that the proposals come from a\r\nSecretary-General who has demonstrated, through his\r\noutstanding management, a great capacity for\r\nadministration; conducting with singular skill the\r\nimplementation of his proposals agreed to in 1997.\r\nThis ensures that, in observing the process of\r\nimplementing this report as a joint effort, it will be\r\npossible to make the Organization capable of dealing\r\nwith the international challenges of today — challenges\r\nwhich are probably the most difficult faced by the\r\nOrganization since it was created.\r\nThe proposal to carry out at the United Nations\r\nthe tasks that are truly important — by providing better\r\nservice to Member States, by making progress at the\r\nsame time in joint efforts and by investing resources in\r\npriorities — reflects a fortunate combination of\r\nsubstantive, practical and procedural issues, which\r\nsurely makes the report commensurate with today’s\r\nrequirements.\r\nIt is true that the existence of the United Nations\r\nhas rarely seemed more necessary than today, in view\r\nof the great tasks being faced by a globalized humanity.\r\nFrom combating poverty, achieving at least some\r\ndegree of development for a vast majority of the planet,\r\ncaring for the environment and fighting HIV/AIDS to\r\npreserving international peace and security, the United\r\nNations seems more necessary every day.\r\nHowever, we cannot disregard the fact that only\r\nrarely have the voices from different parts of the world,\r\nsupported at times by powerful media, been heard as\r\nloudly as now, spreading a picture of multilateralism as\r\na futile and wasteful undertaking; only rarely have\r\nthese voices been so determined to disregard the\r\nlegitimacy of miltilateralism, denying the need to see\r\nmankind as a whole, denying the urgent need to make\r\nprogress through new institutions, in the task of\r\ncreating greater cooperation in the international\r\nsystem. Chile understands that supporting the reform of\r\nthe system is one way, perhaps the most effective way,\r\nof providing a clear response to those who believe or\r\nact in that way.\r\nWe are not disregarding the difficulties involved\r\nin promoting processes of change in international\r\ninstitutions. We know that frequently such attempts at\r\nchange run up against political realities that express the\r\nlegitimate interests of many of their proponents. In\r\nreality, this has been a recurrent situation in the United\r\nNations where, frequently, concrete results achieved\r\nare not commensurate with the true needs of the\r\nOrganization, although they are presented as such.\r\nTherefore, we feel it is urgent to appeal for a\r\nconstructive spirit. We believe that nothing is more\r\nlegitimate than to explore the consequences of the\r\nproposals made by the Secretary-General, to seek to\r\nprovide information to the whole membership, to\r\nsuggest alternatives or indicate objections. However,\r\nwe believe that any criticism should be introduced with\r\na constructive spirit, with full respect for the powers\r\nthat are given to the Secretary-General under the\r\nCharter.\r\nWe wish to recognize before all else the\r\nimportance of the fact that the report begins by\r\nstressing that the Millennium Development Goals\r\nconstitute the highest task of the Organization. For\r\ndeveloping countries, it is extremely important that the\r\nSecretary-General persist in the road map and in the\r\nreports that measure both the progress and the\r\nlimitations and failures being experienced on this path\r\ntowards overcoming poverty, ignorance and disease.\r\nWe also recognize the importance of analyzing\r\nthe impact of globalization on development. Reducing\r\nthe risks that it entails for the developing countries is a\r\nfundamental task, not only in economic and social\r\nterms, but also for ensuring the maintenance, if not the\r\nsurvival, of the values of human rights and democracy,\r\nas well as international security. In this area it is\r\nnecessary that there be a well-informed, frank debate\r\namong Member States, and to which the Secretariat can\r\nmake a relevant contribution. In this connection and in\r\nother areas related to economic development,\r\ninteraction with the Bretton Woods institutions is a\r\nnecessity that the report rightly recognizes.\r\nWe also feel that of particular interest are the\r\nproposals intended to improve various aspects of the\r\nrelationship between Governments and the United\r\nNations system in the field of human rights. Here, it is\r\nvery important to call for the maintenance of the true\r\npurposes of the Commission on Human Rights, which\r\nin recent years has been the subject of political\r\nmanipulation. Such manipulation is not beneficial in\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nany way to the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights.\r\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the proposals\r\naimed at improving the system of human rights in the\r\nUnited Nations and support for human rights in every\r\ncountry. We agree with the idea that the Office of the\r\nHigh Commissioner should be strengthened. We also\r\npropose that it prepare an annual report on the situation\r\nof human rights worldwide. Such a report would make\r\nit possible to depoliticize the debate within the\r\nCommission and help to facilitate bilateral dialogue on\r\nhuman rights in a more objective framework. Similarly,\r\nwe believe that the initiatives proposed to reposition\r\nthe Department of Public Information are relevant\r\nbecause, as the report indicates, public opinion should\r\nbe an essential basis for strengthening the\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe attach great value to the Secretary-General’s\r\nsuggestions for enhancing efforts to reform the\r\nworking methods of the General Assembly. The report\r\nindicates the need to pursue the process of reform of\r\nthe intergovernmental organs, deeming it to be a\r\nprincipal aspect of any process to strengthen the\r\nOrganization. The Secretary-General’s comments\r\nreiterate many of the points raised in the debates held\r\non this item in the past two sessions of the General\r\nAssembly. It is to be recalled that the efforts to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly were relaunched at the\r\nfifty-first session with the adoption of resolution\r\n51/241, which contains a set of measures to modernize\r\nthis principal organ of the United Nations.\r\nHowever, the process of implementing some of\r\nthose commitments, which was intensified during Mr.\r\nHarri Holkeri’s presidency of the General Assembly\r\nand continued with the greater participation of the\r\nmembership during the presidency of Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo, is still incomplete in many aspects. Particularly\r\nnoteworthy among those aspects are the overloaded\r\nagenda, the reduction or elimination of duplication of\r\nwork, and coordination among organs that deal with\r\nsimilar items from different perspectives. We fully\r\nsupport the efforts that you, Sir, are currently making\r\nto promote new steps on the path of General Assembly\r\nreform and we trust that they are supported by the\r\nentire membership.\r\nOn a different point, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil has made progress in the search for functional\r\nnorms appropriate to the goals and objectives of its\r\ncurrent agenda. However, we believe that much ground\r\nremains to be covered. In that connection, while the\r\nefficient treatment of the agenda has been improved\r\nthrough the convening of various segments, we feel\r\nthat the relationship between the results achieved by\r\nthe Council and the work of the Second and Third\r\nCommittees remains weak.\r\nFurthermore, it would seem necessary to\r\nstrengthen coordination within the Council, not only\r\nwith the agencies of the United Nations system, but\r\nalso in the relationship between them and the\r\nsubsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council\r\nitself. The report rightly notes that it is also necessary\r\nfor the General Assembly to clarify its responsibilities\r\nto the Economic and Social Council in connection with\r\nthe integrated follow-up of major conferences of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAt the same time, we fully endorse the idea that\r\nany reform of the United Nations will be incomplete\r\nwithout reform of the Security Council. We are ready\r\nto participate in efforts to resume exploring this issue\r\nand the relationship between the three main\r\nintergovernmental organs of the Organization.\r\nI cannot conclude without referring briefly to the\r\nquestion of the budget. We feel that the affirmations\r\nmade in the report are basically accurate. The\r\nduplication of tasks and the use of wasteful procedures\r\nthat seriously hamper the consideration of priorities\r\nguiding the preparation of the budget are severe\r\nlimitations on the functioning of the Organization. We\r\nunderstand that there are possible alternatives to the\r\nSecretariat’s proposals, but we are interested in\r\npursuing the promotion of a medium-term plan\r\ncovering a shorter period; a budget that has clear\r\nstrategic objectives; and an enhanced assessment\r\nsystem. We are prepared to consider in detail the\r\nproposals for flexibility in budget management, which\r\nwe feel would be most constructive since they respond\r\nto a modern and updated approach to administration.\r\nThe report contains many other proposals that\r\nwould require a great deal of commentary here. We\r\nunderstand that, with this debate, we are opening up an\r\nagenda of work that will require more detailed\r\napplication. We advocate a resolution that will allow\r\nMember States to fully support the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General. We could thus make more tangible\r\nour oft-stated intentions of creating an Organization\r\nthat is adequate to the challenges of the new century.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nwish at the outset to associate myself with the\r\nstatement made this morning by the representative of\r\nVenezuela on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for his\r\nsubmission of the report in document A/57/387, and for\r\nits style, its formal features and its substance. As to the\r\nstyle, the document follows in the tradition launched\r\nby the landmark document entitled “We the peoples:\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the twenty-first\r\ncentury”, prepared on the occasion of the Millennium\r\nSummit. Its language is crisp, precise and, at times,\r\neven eloquent, and the actions proposed are easy to\r\nunderstand. As to the content, we endorse the general\r\nthrust of the report, which builds on the reform\r\nproposal produced in 1997 in document A/51/950 and\r\nwelcomed by the General Assembly in its resolution\r\n52/12.\r\nIn this respect, the Secretary-General reminds us\r\nonce again that, in his opinion, “reform is a process,\r\nnot an event” (A/57/387, para. 196). True to this idea,\r\nwe find a package of proposals that point, in an\r\nincremental fashion, towards a more relevant, efficient\r\nand effective Organization with a clear sense of\r\ndirection in terms of fulfilling the major objectives\r\ncontained in the Charter. For those who believe in this\r\ngradualist but cumulative philosophy, the document\r\nwill be found to be balanced, totally consistent with the\r\nactions undertaken since 1997, and endowed with\r\nadditional proposals that will move the process\r\nforward, perhaps slowly, but surely. For those who\r\nprefer bolder changes, the document will no doubt be a\r\ndisappointment.\r\nMy own delegation identifies, in a general\r\nmanner, with the first group. In other words, we accept\r\nthat we are embarked on a process that has already\r\nyielded important achievements and some\r\nshortcomings, and that the majority of the actions that\r\nare now being proposed to us are reasonable and\r\nconsistent with the logic of reform initiated five years\r\nago. In consequence, we subscribe to the actions being\r\nproposed, with some nuances that I will refer to\r\npresently.\r\nOur only reservation to what was stated, and on\r\nwhich we would have preferred more outspokenness,\r\nrelates to the inevitable need to reform the United\r\nNations system of governance in tandem with reform\r\nof the Secretariat. For understandable reasons, the\r\nSecretary-General focuses his proposals on his own\r\nsphere of competence, limiting himself to “[venturing]\r\nsome suggestions” (para. 14) on reform of the\r\nintergovernmental bodies. However, if we truly wanted\r\nto strengthen our Organization, we would have had to\r\nadd a sixth section to the report, with more detailed\r\nproposals regarding how to adapt the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and,\r\nespecially, the Security Council to a renewed vision of\r\nthe United Nations for the twenty-first century. After\r\nall, nothing prevents the Secretary-General from taking\r\nthe initiative to make proposals; it will be up to\r\nGovernments whether or not to accept them.\r\nI will comment briefly on the specific actions\r\nproposed, following the sequence of the report. To\r\nbegin with, we agree that it is necessary to focus our\r\nefforts on priority items. Despite the extremely broad\r\nmandate of its Charter, the United Nations is no\r\nexception to the rule that every organization and every\r\nhuman activity must prioritize its activities. We share\r\nthe view that the Millennium Declaration, the\r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation provide guidelines. The difficulty lies\r\nin the fact that the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nlooked at individually, result in a wide thematic spread.\r\nIn other words, if a particular intergovernmental forum\r\nwishes to address a specific topic it will undoubtedly\r\nbe able to relate that topic to an element in the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nBut the Secretary-General’s report offers\r\nmodalities on which to base our priorities. The first set\r\nof modalities relates to our working methods, and are\r\nintended to ensure that we do not spend time on items\r\nwhose inclusion in our agenda is based not on actual\r\nneed, but on mere inertia.\r\nThe second is in the area of the allocation of\r\nresources. This is why we eagerly await what is offered\r\nin connection with action 1: a revised programme\r\nbudget that better reflects the link between priorities\r\nand the activities to be undertaken.\r\nAnother point relating to section II is that it\r\nsingles out two thematic areas — human rights and\r\npublic information — for specific attention. Many will\r\nwonder why those particular activities were selected.\r\nBut we must recognize that many delegations have\r\nlong criticized productivity in these two thematic areas\r\nas being less than optimal. In that connection, we await\r\nthe implementation of actions 2 to 5, consisting of\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nsteps to be taken by the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We share the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that we can do much at the\r\nintergovernmental level to strengthen the functioning\r\nand credibility of the Commission on Human Rights.\r\nWe take note of the measures under actions 6 to 10,\r\nwhich, in our view, fall within the mandate of the\r\nSecretary-General.\r\nWith regard to section III, which deals with the\r\nprovision of Secretariat services to intergovernmental\r\nbodies, my points are the following. It is difficult to\r\ndisagree with the substance of the measures proposed\r\nunder actions 11 and 12, regarding reports. These\r\nmeasures nevertheless give rise to two questions. The\r\nfirst has to do with the criteria to be applied in order to\r\n“consolidate and regroup recurrent reports” (para. 92),\r\nwho will define them and how they will be applied.\r\nThe second query raises the invariably delicate\r\nquestion of the limits of the authority of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral vis-à-vis that of the intergovernmental bodies,\r\nsince the consolidation and reorganization of reports\r\ncould also affect the manner in which the agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is structured. All this calls for\r\ncareful interaction between the Secretariat and the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn the same vein, and subject to the same\r\nreservations, it is difficult to disagree with the\r\nobservations in paragraphs 100 to 108, which are, in a\r\nsense summarized in action 13, and all of which, again,\r\nfall within the purview of the Secretary-General. The\r\nonly possible ingredient missing from the approach to\r\nprogramming and conferences is providing the\r\nDepartment of General Assembly and Conference\r\nManagement with the discretion and flexibility\r\nrequired to ensure that a debate is not interrupted in its\r\nclimactic phase by lack of services, for example, by\r\nwithdrawing the interpreters at the very moment when\r\na consensus is about to be reached at 6 p.m.\r\nRegarding section IV, which aims for better\r\ncoordination and coherence within the system, most of\r\nthe measures are nothing more than an extension of\r\npolicies initiated in 1997, nearly all of which, again,\r\nfall within the purview of the Secretary-General. We\r\nrecognize that defining who does what within an\r\norganization as wide-ranging and complex as the\r\nUnited Nations is a challenge of the highest order. We\r\nalso recognize that, as the Secretary-General points\r\nout, the steps taken during the past five years, while\r\ngoing in the right direction, are insufficient. Thus, there\r\ncan certainly be no objection to carrying forward what\r\nhas been initiated.\r\nWe would add four brief observations. First,\r\nparagraph 115 underestimates the potential of the\r\nregional commissions to contribute to the strengthening\r\nof the United Nations. In fact, the few lines devoted to\r\nthe regional approach add nothing to what has been\r\nsaid in prior reports. We would have wished to see in\r\nthe report, at least, the intention to give the regional\r\ncommissions a more significant role in the provision of\r\ntechnical cooperation, since their presence in the field\r\ngrants them a certain comparative advantage in doing\r\nthis, as the Secretary-General himself recognizes in\r\nparagraph 123. We therefore look forward with interest\r\nto the outcome of action 15.\r\nSecondly, we agree with the Secretary-General’s\r\nidea that coordination at the level of each country is the\r\nmost important factor in introducing coherence to the\r\nsupport the Organization provides its Member\r\ncountries. The establishment of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group was certainly a very important\r\nstep in the right direction. We look forward with\r\ninterest to the proposal enunciated in action 14 to\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s effectiveness in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador), Vice-\r\nPresident took the Chair.\r\nThirdly, we agree with the creation of a new post\r\nat the level of Assistant Secretary-General to support\r\npolicy coherence and management in the Department\r\nof Economic and Social Affairs. We believe that the\r\nconsolidation of the three economic departments in\r\nexistence prior to 1997 into a single entity brought\r\ntogether too many responsibilities — in terms of both\r\nvolume and variety — in a single administrative unit.\r\nEnhancing the Department’s capacity to organize its\r\nwork around specific functions therefore makes\r\nconsiderable sense. The same goes for action 17, which\r\nwe also support.\r\nFinally in this area, we endorse the idea of\r\npursuing the recent trend to further involve civil\r\nsociety and the business sector in the work of the\r\nUnited Nations. At the same time, we appreciate the\r\npractical difficulties that this involves, as well as the\r\nresistance it has encountered in some quarters. We\r\ntherefore support the establishment of the panel of\r\neminent persons referred to in action 19.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nAs to section V, which deals with the planning\r\nand budgeting process, this contains the potentially\r\nmost far-reaching proposals of the entire report. I must\r\nsay right away that we generally support those\r\nproposals. It is essential that we continue and expand\r\nthe reforms already initiated in this field, both in the\r\nareas of results-based budgeting and human resources.\r\nWe endorse the Secretary-General’s observation that\r\n“The goal we should pursue is to make planning and\r\nbudgeting real strategic instruments in the service of\r\nthe priorities and the programme of work of the\r\nOrganization” (A/57/387, para. 154). We also endorse\r\nthe evaluation put forth in paragraphs 155 to 165.\r\nAccordingly, we feel that the proposals contained\r\nin actions 21 and 22 deserve our support, although the\r\ndetails require further clarification. Moreover, I would\r\nventure to propose that those proposals should be\r\nconsidered at the highest level of representation of our\r\nmissions, given that their implications extend well\r\nbeyond the jurisdiction of any of the specialized\r\ncommissions.\r\nTurning quickly to the last section, I do not wish\r\nto extend my remarks any further. Suffice it to say that\r\nwe agree with the Secretary-General on the need for us\r\nto be able to rely on an excellent staff. Many of the\r\nmeasures proposed in this regard fall within the\r\npurview of the Secretary-General. We have no major\r\nobjections to the steps announced. On the other hand,\r\nwith regard to the recommendations that require the\r\napproval of Governments, we have some doubts about\r\naction 26. We shall indicate the nature of those doubts\r\nin due course. We also support the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal for an independent review of the International\r\nCivil Service Commission.\r\nI wish to conclude with a general observation on\r\nthe entire report. The report tends to underestimate the\r\nenormous force exerted by inertia as a factor hindering\r\nprogress towards translating the report’s proposals into\r\nreality. That inertia exists within the Secretariat and, in\r\na similar or even more pronounced way, in our\r\nintergovernmental forums. That inertia is due to\r\nintangible elements that are difficult to overcome:\r\nhabit, vested interests, natural resistance to change,\r\npersonal and group agendas and many more such\r\nelements. This factor is present in any human\r\nendeavour and should not surprise us. But the point is\r\nthat the reforms sought require not only changes in\r\nnorms, rules and provisions; they also require changing\r\nattitudes. It is therefore up to all of us whether or not\r\nthe forward-looking vision that the Secretary-General\r\npresents in his report becomes a reality.\r\nMr. Wang Yingfan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387). We commend him on his\r\ntireless efforts to reform the Organization. Our thanks\r\nalso go to the President for arranging this timely\r\nplenary debate on such an important question.\r\nChina associates itself with the statement made\r\nby the Ambassador of Venezuela on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China. In addition, I would like to\r\nmake the following observations with regard to the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nFirst, United Nations reform should attach equal\r\nimportance to questions pertaining to the maintenance\r\nof peace and security and those related to development,\r\nthe eradication of poverty and the promotion of\r\nsustainable development. We support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to align United Nations activities\r\nwith such priorities as implementing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and providing an effective\r\nresponse to the challenges of globalization and its\r\nimpact on development. This is in line with the desires\r\nof the Organization’s membership, and in particular\r\nwith those of developing countries. We hope that the\r\nSecretary-General will now formulate practical and\r\nfeasible recommendations, and take effective measures,\r\naimed at the reaching the Goals. That includes, among\r\nother things, devoting more resources to development,\r\nmobilizing developed countries to increase official\r\ndevelopment assistance, further opening up markets,\r\neliminating certain trade barriers and ensuring that\r\nglobalization benefits all countries. All this should be\r\nreflected in the United Nations operational\r\narrangements, programmes and resource allocation.\r\nSecondly, China supports reducing the number of\r\nSecretariat reports and imposing page limits, while\r\nimproving their quality, namely, by placing greater\r\nemphasis on analysis and recommendations. We also\r\nsupport a reduction in the number of meetings and\r\nimproving the quality of conference services. We hope\r\nthat the Secretary-General’s recommendations will be\r\ntaken fully into account when the item of the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly is taken up. We\r\nalso endorse many other recommendations contained in\r\nthe report, such as those related to the restructuring of\r\nthe Department of Public Information, the improved\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nmanagement of United Nations libraries and enhanced\r\ncoordination among United Nations bodies.\r\nThirdly, the financial planning and budgetary\r\nprocess of the United Nations needs streamlining in\r\norder to be more in line with reality and real needs and\r\nto improve the effectiveness of its work. At the same\r\ntime, we believe that the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination should continue to play a special role\r\nin the financial planning and budgetary process of the\r\nUnited Nations. When considering that item, we must\r\nmake sure that decision-making on financial matters\r\nultimately rests with Member States and that the views\r\nof the developing Member States are valued.\r\nFourthly, the proposed inclusion of the human\r\nrights question in United Nations development\r\nassistance programmes at the country level has caused\r\nserious concern among the developing countries.\r\nHuman rights questions are distinct from those relating\r\nto development assistance programmes. We are not in\r\nfavour of lumping the two together. China supports\r\nUnited Nations activities that promote and protect\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. But human\r\nrights programmes must be suited to the specific\r\nconditions of the countries concerned. Full importance\r\nmust be attached to the realization of the right to\r\ndevelopment and the views of Governments concerned\r\nmust be respected.\r\nFifthly, we support the establishment of a panel\r\nof eminent persons to review the relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and civil society and to offer\r\npractical recommendations for improved modalities of\r\ninteraction. In conducting such a review, the panel\r\nshould bear in mind the need to support and improve\r\nrelations between civil society and the United Nations,\r\nsquarely face the problems that have emerged and\r\nwidely solicit the views of the membership.\r\nSixthly, all States have a vital stake in United\r\nNations reform and they should be assured of equal\r\nparticipation in reform-related deliberations and\r\nconsultations. The General Assembly could consider\r\nadoption at this session of a draft resolution containing\r\nelements acceptable to all, with a view to maintaining\r\nthe momentum of reforms now under way.\r\nMr. Mbanefo (Nigeria): At the Millennium\r\nSummit, our leaders pledged to make the United\r\nNations a more effective institution for the promotion\r\nof world peace and sustainable development. They\r\nwere conscious of the potential and weaknesses of the\r\nOrganization when they issued their solemn\r\nDeclaration. In essence, the Millennium Declaration\r\nwas a reaffirmation of our leaders’ faith in the efficacy\r\nand relevance of the United Nations in protecting\r\nhumanity from self-destruction.\r\nIn an ever-changing world full of challenges, the\r\nUnited Nations remains the only credible multilateral\r\ninstitution that guarantees universality, equality, peace\r\nand the prosperity of States. Some of the challenges\r\nthat confront us today, complex yet urgent, were\r\ninconceivable 50 years ago. The challenges can only be\r\nmet through a revitalized and strengthened United\r\nNations.\r\nIt was for that reason that, five years ago, our\r\nOrganization embarked on a process of reform. Since\r\nthen, the world community has come to expect more\r\nfar-reaching changes within the United Nations and its\r\nconstituent bodies. Accountability, transparency,\r\nconsistency and inclusiveness, as well as efficiency and\r\neffectiveness, remain the focal principles behind the\r\nreforms. As the United Nations continues on that track,\r\nit should place the needs of its Member States above\r\neverything else, while the quality of its services,\r\nprovided through the Secretariat, should be of a\r\nprofessional standard comparable to none.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the views\r\nexpressed earlier by the chairs of the African Group,\r\nthe Movement of the Non-Aligned Countries and the\r\nAfrican Union, as well as the Group of 77 and China,\r\nbut it would, nonetheless, like to specifically address\r\nthe following issues contained in the report.\r\nRegarding peacekeeping efforts, Nigeria notes the\r\ndetermined efforts of the Secretary-General to press on\r\nwith the revitalization of the United Nations. His\r\nefforts are beginning to yield dividends. The\r\nreorganization and enhancement of the Department of\r\nPeacekeeping Operations has resulted in the\r\nimprovement of the capacity of the United Nations to\r\ndeploy and manage complex peacekeeping and peace-\r\nbuilding operations. In that regard, Sierra Leone is a\r\nsuccess story, where the United Nations effectively\r\ntook over peacekeeping operations from the\r\nMonitoring Group of the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States and succeeded in the restoration of\r\nnormalcy after a bitter conflict and civil war. The peace\r\nprocesses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nAngola are further proof of the results and benefits of\r\nthe reforms. While acknowledging those modest\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nachievements, we must not forget the painful lessons of\r\nRwanda in 1994, when the United Nations developed\r\ncold feet and allowed mindless acts of the most\r\ngrotesque form of genocide to go unchallenged.\r\nConcerning General Assembly reform, the\r\nAssembly, as the highest legislative organ of the United\r\nNations, needs to maintain its universality. Any reform\r\nin the United Nations must seek to strengthen that\r\nunique organ, rather than weaken it. Nigeria applauds\r\nthe modest achievements recorded so far in the\r\nrevitalization process. It is our view that, although the\r\nstreamlining of the activities of the Assembly —\r\nespecially with respect to meetings, clustering of\r\nagenda items, early election of the Assembly President\r\nand Main Committee Chairmen — has proven useful, a\r\nlot still needs to be done, particularly with regard to the\r\nimplementation of resolutions and decisions of the\r\nAssembly. As we all know, the Assembly is the main\r\ndeliberative and legislative organ of the United\r\nNations. For that reason, it should be strengthened in\r\norder for it to assume a greater decision-making role\r\nwithin the Organization, to give its Members more say\r\nand to preserve multilateralism.\r\nWith regard to enhancing the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, we agree with the view of the\r\nSecretary-General on globalization. It poses serious\r\nchallenges to mankind. While we do not doubt the\r\npotentials inherent in globalization, we are gravely\r\nconcerned about its effects and consequences. We are\r\nwitnesses to the ever-widening divide between the rich\r\nand poor countries and between different regions in an\r\never-shrinking world. Living as we do in a world\r\ngoverned by cyber-technology, there is an urgent need\r\nto find ways to make globalization more beneficial for\r\nthe greater majority of humanity. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations can play a leading role in that direction.\r\nThe Organization must also show more leadership in\r\nhelping find durable solutions to developmental\r\nproblems such as external debt, market access,\r\ntechnology transfer, human development and capacity-\r\nbuilding for developing countries. It is necessary to\r\nkeep those issues on the priority list of a revitalized\r\nand strengthened United Nations system.\r\nAnother area where the United Nations can be\r\nand is already playing a commendable role is in\r\nbuilding strong partnerships. We note the partnership\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and sub-\r\nregional organizations, as well as non-State actors such\r\nas civil society organizations, voluntary agencies,\r\ninterest groups and philanthropic foundations,\r\nuniversities and individuals. This deliberate outreach\r\nstrategy has sensitized the peoples of the world to the\r\nobjectives of the United Nations and has, in turn,\r\ncontributed to success in monitoring international\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn the wake of the Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, partnership initiatives would form part\r\nof the implementation strategies of national\r\nGovernments in fulfilling their commitments. Thus, the\r\nUnited Nations should position itself to monitor and to\r\nfollow up on the partnerships as they unfold around the\r\nworld. In particular, the Economic and Social Council\r\nmust elaborate an effective strategy to follow up on\r\ninternational conferences without necessarily whittling\r\naway at the role of its subsidiary bodies.\r\nWith respect to human rights, Nigeria endorses\r\nthe view that the United Nations provides a unique\r\ninstitutional framework to develop and promote human\r\nrights, norms and practices, while respecting national\r\nand cultural diversities. We believe that the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights is necessary for the\r\nrealization of the United Nations vision of a just and\r\npeaceful world. Nigeria therefore supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that the building of strong\r\nhuman rights institutions at the national level is the\r\nonly way to ensure the protection and advancement of\r\nbasic human rights.\r\nWith respect to the special needs of Africa, we\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for keeping alive the\r\nspirit of the Millennium Declaration, which recognizes\r\nAfrica’s special needs. In this regard, we note the\r\nproposal to assign to the Secretary-General’s Advisor\r\nfor Special Assignments in Africa the responsibilities\r\nof coordinating and guiding reports and input on\r\nAfrica-related matters and on Least Developed\r\nCountries through the Office of the Special\r\nCoordinator for Africa and Least Developed Countries\r\n(OSCAL). However, we would expect the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to elaborate further on how the United Nations\r\nwould sensitize and mobilize system-wide support, as\r\nwell as mobilize resources for the implementation of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD). In our opinion, the success and sustenance\r\nof NEPAD should be given full and unequivocal\r\nattention by the United Nations system, especially now\r\nthat NEPAD has become the overall policy framework\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nwithin which the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity will channel support for Africa.\r\nWith respect to allocating resources, Nigeria\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s efforts aimed at\r\nstreamlining the planning and budgeting system. The\r\nneed for creating real strategic instruments and\r\nachieving greater effectiveness should, however, not\r\npreclude the retention of priorities contained in the\r\nMillennium Assembly Goals, enunciated in the\r\nmedium-term plan and other legislative mandates.\r\nFurthermore, adequate programme planning, evaluation\r\nand implementation monitoring should be enhanced\r\nthrough a well-articulated intergovernmental process.\r\nIn that regard, the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination should be encouraged to fine-tune its\r\nworking methods to enhance its performance.\r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s bold\r\ninitiative on planning, managing meetings and\r\ndocumentation, provided such actions do not\r\nundermine the ability of Member States to take well-\r\ninformed decisions and that hard copies will remain\r\navailable to all Member States, as not all countries are\r\nable to take full advantage of electronic technology.\r\nNigeria is not adverse to the desirability of giving\r\nthe Secretary-General the necessary prerogative to\r\nreallocate human and material resources of the United\r\nNations as he deems appropriate. To do otherwise\r\nwould undermine his capacity to deliver results.\r\nHowever, we believe that such authorization should be\r\ndone in relation to the allocation of funds and resources\r\nfor social and economic programmes and projects, in\r\naccordance with the proper mechanisms of\r\naccountability and monitoring.\r\nOn human resource management, Nigeria\r\nsupports the idea of deserving staff being encouraged\r\nto attain their career objectives. We therefore support\r\nthe promotion of General Service staff to the\r\nProfessional category, and we call upon the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to fully explore ways to increase the number of\r\nGeneral Service or eligible posts among those not\r\nsubject to geographical distribution.\r\nWith respect to Security Council reform, as we\r\nhave stated on previous occasions, Nigeria believes\r\nthat the Security Council needs to be reformed,\r\nexpanded and made more representative. While we\r\nnote some improvement in its working methods and\r\nregular consultations with non-members, external\r\nactors and troop-contributing countries, we still hold\r\nthe view that the Council needs to be expanded in both\r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories. We\r\ncommend the Council’s role in conflict prevention,\r\nresolution and peace-building, and we pledge our\r\nsupport in those efforts.\r\nFinally, we thank the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, especially the strategies articulated in it for\r\nrevitalizing the Organization. Nigeria will continue to\r\nsupport all efforts to enable the United Nations to live\r\nup to the expectation of its Member States.\r\nMr. Stagno (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me to thank the Secretary-General and the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General for the preparation and\r\npresentation of the report on the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations (A/57/387 and Corr.1).\r\nWithout any doubt, 57 years after its creation, the\r\nUnited Nations requires thorough reform. The\r\nOrganization has grown enormously over that long\r\nperiod of time. Its functions have been expanded. It has\r\nexplored to the fullest extent the possibilities enshrined\r\nin its Charter. It has developed innumerable\r\nprogrammes and new mandates. It has undertaken\r\nadditional obligations, and numerous institutional\r\nmechanisms have been created to respond to the new\r\ndemands. Similarly, many programmes have been\r\nabandoned or have lost their relevance. Many mandates\r\nhave been overtaken by the quick pace of history.\r\nMany departments have lost their raison d’être, while\r\nothers that are still necessary have lost the political\r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nFor more than half a century, the Organization\r\nhas been the sounding board for various conflicts and\r\nthe events of international politics. Its organizational\r\nstructure and budget reflect the scars of recent history.\r\nSome of its functions and tasks no longer correspond to\r\nthe current needs of humankind, while others reflect\r\nthe ideological struggles and political concepts of times\r\ngone by.\r\nThe Organization’s growth has been disorderly. It\r\nhas lacked a strategic vision and a unified conceptual\r\nframework to guide that growth. The Organization has\r\nsurvived, and it has adapted. But we cannot say that it\r\nhas learned or that it has evolved. In this sense, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative\r\nto launch a review process in order to increase the\r\nOrganization’s efficiency and give a new impetus to its\r\nactivities.\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nWhen we consider the reform and strengthening\r\nprocess, we must keep in mind the particular nature of\r\nthe Organization. The United Nations is not a private\r\ncorporation seeking financial gains, but a public\r\ninstitution at the service of the Member States\r\ncomposing it and the people those Members represent.\r\nUnquestionably, some reforms that would make sense\r\nfrom a purely administrative point of view are not\r\ncompatible with the political demands on the\r\nOrganization. Any reform of the Organization must be\r\ndesigned to improve the quality of services provided to\r\nthe Member States and to implement faithfully their\r\nlegislative mandates. In this context, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the proposals embodied in the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s report as a first step in a process of dialog\r\nbetween the Secretariat and Member States to decide,\r\nin due time, which measures it will be appropriate to\r\nimplement in order to strengthen the Organization.\r\nHowever, we are fully aware that this process requires\r\na detailed and careful consideration of the proposals\r\nembodied in the report by all the competent\r\nintergovernmental bodies.\r\nFor this reason we do not think it appropriate to\r\nendorse any of the proposals without having first\r\nconsidered all their operational and budgetary\r\nimplications. Similarly, we would be concerned by the\r\nunilateral implementation of these measures by the\r\nSecretariat without having an express mandate from\r\nMember States. Furthermore, we wonder what the\r\nimpact of these measures will be on the existing\r\nlegislative mandates duly adopted by the Member\r\nStates.\r\nClearly, we welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to give priority to those activities that\r\npromote the attainment of the goals enshrined in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and in the plans of action of\r\nthe most recent global summits. However, the adoption\r\nof a new list of priorities should not lead the Secretariat\r\nautomatically to discard the mandates adopted by the\r\nprincipal intergovernmental bodies of the Organization.\r\nFrom a constitutional standpoint, the General\r\nAssembly must approve, expressly and in a detailed\r\nfashion, the new priorities and the changes to the\r\nexisting mandates. The possible adoption of limits or\r\nsunset provisions, suggested in paragraph 44 of the\r\nreport (document A/57/387), is a prerogative that the\r\nintergovernmental bodies have yet to exercise.\r\nMy delegation finds that some of the proposed\r\nmeasures are timely. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that it is necessary to improve the working\r\nmechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights to\r\nmake it more effective. Similarly, we welcome his\r\nintention to study ways to rationalize the presentation\r\nof national reports to the human rights treaty bodies.\r\nWe value his intention to improve the coordination\r\namong the various organs within the system as well as\r\nhis efforts to give more incentives and to rejuvenate the\r\nOrganization’s staff with a view to providing better\r\nservice to the Member States.\r\nNevertheless, we have some doubts regarding\r\nother recommendations. The proposals to make more\r\nflexible the transfer of resources and staff, up to 10 per\r\ncent of the budget, and to give greater authority to\r\nprogramme managers to oversee the funds assigned to\r\nthem seem contrary to the best practices in the\r\nmanagement of public funds and would require\r\nsubstantial oversight and evaluation measures.\r\nMoreover, these measures would jeopardize the\r\nimplementation of the mandates approved by\r\nintergovernmental bodies. It could be asked, for\r\ninstance, what is currently happening to the funds\r\nassigned to the preparation of the Repertory of Practice\r\nof United Nations Organs. We have heard that those\r\nfunds are informally reassigned to other programmes,\r\nignoring the express mandate of Member States to\r\nupdate it. It is therefore not surprising that there are\r\ndelays in its publication. My delegation supports the\r\nstrengthening of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination, as well as the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ).\r\nThe suggestion to reduce the number of meetings\r\nand reports is somewhat simplistic. The meetings\r\ncurrently held and the reports currently produced\r\nrespond to the requirements of the various\r\nintergovernmental organs. Therefore, the organ in\r\nquestion must approve any reduction, after considering\r\neach particular case. As a consequence, we cannot\r\naccept the concept of discretion as proposed in\r\nparagraph 96 of the report. True reform should, in fact,\r\nensure that the reports provide the most updated data\r\nand contain greater substantive analysis.\r\nThe suggestion to combine the management of\r\nconferences and Secretariat services under the\r\nDepartment of General Assembly and Conference\r\nManagement ignores the operational and technical need\r\nof the various bodies. Nobody has proposed, for\r\ninstance, to unify the Secretariat of the Security\r\nCouncil with that of the General Assembly because it\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nwould jeopardize the quality of the services provided.\r\nSimilarly, the technical secretariat of the various\r\ncommittees should not be combined under the same\r\nDepartment without guaranteeing the continuity and\r\nquality of the services provided.\r\nWe view with interest the proposal to create an\r\nalliance with non-governmental organizations and the\r\nprivate sector. However, this task requires great\r\ncaution. The Organization should be open to all such\r\nentities, allowing the expression of various positions\r\nand viewpoints. We should not, however, allow the\r\nprivate agenda of any individual non-governmental\r\norganization to usurp the agenda of the United Nations.\r\nMoreover, we should emphasize that those entities\r\ncannot be substitutes for democratically elected\r\nGovernments. Only representative Governments with a\r\nclear democratic mandate represent their peoples\r\nlegitimately.\r\nFrom a procedural standpoint my delegation is in\r\nfavor of the creation of an open-ended working group\r\nto consider the main proposals of the report, while the\r\nMain Committees of the General Assembly consider\r\nthose recommendations that fall within their\r\ncompetence. In particular, we would like to receive a\r\ndetailed analysis of these proposals from the ACABQ\r\nand to know the budgetary impact of each of them.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): I now invite\r\nthe representative of the Russian Federation to take the\r\nfloor.\r\nMr. Gatilov (Russia)(spoke in Russian): Russia\r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s report,\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387) which, based on the recent\r\nprogress in past years, offers a package to enhance the\r\nefficiency of the United Nations. We share those views\r\nand recommendations that provide for practical steps to\r\nfurther reform the United Nations and enhance its\r\ncapacity to respond to global challenges.\r\nIn this regard, we support the concept of\r\nstrengthened coordination within the United Nations\r\nsystem and interaction among its key components. We\r\nbelieve that the efforts to achieve this goal should\r\nfocus on formulating a consolidated response to new\r\nchallenges and threats, primarily those posed by the\r\ninternational terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. The recent tragic events, particularly in\r\nIndonesia and Moscow, demonstrated once again to the\r\nworld the unprecedented cruelty of terrorists who sow\r\ndeath and destruction and their readiness to sacrifice\r\nlives of innocent people. Effective counter-terrorism\r\ncannot be successful without concerted efforts of the\r\nentire international community and a special role in\r\nthis respect that should be played by the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s positive\r\nassessment of the efforts within the United Nations to\r\nimprove the peacekeeping activities of the\r\nOrganization, his desire to put particular emphasis on\r\ndeveloping United Nations anti-crisis mechanisms to\r\nconduct multifunctional peacekeeping operations and\r\neffective division of labour between the United Nations\r\nand regional organizations.\r\nWe acknowledge the need to strengthen the role\r\nof the General Assembly, in particular by rationalizing\r\nits agenda. We share the view that the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council should not lead just to an increase in\r\nits membership, since the success of the Security\r\nCouncil’s work depends, to no small degree, on its\r\nability to take prompt and effective decisions. In any\r\ncase, the broadest possible agreement on Security\r\nCouncil reform should be sought without counter-\r\nproductive haste.\r\nWe believe that it would be more logical to codify\r\nthe measures taken by the Council to improve its\r\nworking methods and procedures within the framework\r\nof the overall Security Council reform package at a\r\nmore advanced stage in this process. Referring to\r\nconflict prevention and settlement, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is right to highlight the need to coordinate, as\r\nneeded, interaction between the Security Council, the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, and to clearly define the roles of the\r\nDepartments of Political Affairs and Peacekeeping\r\nOperations of the United Nations Secretariat.\r\nThe improvement of the United Nations human\r\nrights-related activities identified in the report is a top\r\npriority. The actions proposed in this area are balanced\r\nand realistic, especially those aimed at streamlining\r\nprocedures for reporting on the part of Governments on\r\nthe implementation of all international human-rights\r\ntreaties and at improving special procedures with\r\nregard to human rights.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General’s appeal to\r\ndepoliticize and make more effective the work of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights. We believe that the\r\nfulfilment of the tasks assigned to the United Nations\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights will lead to\r\nenhanced effectiveness of the bodies established by\r\nhuman-rights treaties and system of special procedures\r\non human rights. It is important to ensure that relevant\r\nrecommendations on the part of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights are made in\r\nclose cooperation with all States concerned, fully\r\ntaking into account their remarks and proposals, and\r\nthat the programmes on strengthening the human\r\nrights-related actions at the country level are aimed at\r\nhelping countries develop their capabilities,\r\nparticularly in the protection of human rights.\r\nIn the economic field, we support the proposal to\r\nsingle out globalization as a key area, so as to seize the\r\nopportunities it offers in international trade and in\r\nattracting foreign investment. We approve of the\r\nmeasures to re-enforce the role of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and deepen its dialogue with the\r\nBretton Woods institutions and the World Trade\r\nOrganization, including in the format of annual\r\nmeetings between them and the United Nations.\r\nWe believe it would make sense to have a clearer\r\ndivision of responsibilities among the General\r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and its\r\nfunctional commissions in the social and economic\r\narea with a view to coordinating efforts to implement\r\ndecisions of the United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits. We support the optimization of the agenda\r\nand working methods of the Second Committee, as\r\nwell as measures to consolidate the reporting on social\r\nand economic issues, including the identification of\r\ncrosscutting themes relevant to both the Second and\r\nThird Committees of the General Assembly.\r\nWe welcome the strengthened cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and private sector,\r\nincluding the proposal to create to this end a\r\nPartnerships Office. At the same time, we are not\r\nabsolutely sure whether it is necessary to strengthen the\r\nSecretariat’s planning machinery in the social and\r\neconomic sectors. We think that the existing divisions\r\nin the Department of Economic and Social Affairs cope\r\nwith these issues quite well. We also wish to point out\r\nthat the report says nothing about supporting countries\r\nwith economies in transition, although this subject is\r\nimportant given the specific nature of the social and\r\neconomic problems these countries face.\r\nAs regards the interaction between the United\r\nNations and non-governmental organizations, we\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s intention to establish\r\na panel of eminent persons to review the relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society and offer\r\npractical recommendations in this regard. We wish to\r\nstate that Russia is ready to nominate a highly qualified\r\ncandidate to work on this panel.\r\nWe also took note of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to reform the public information system in\r\nseveral ways simultaneously: organizational change in\r\nthe Department of the Secretariat, optimization of\r\nUnited Nations publications, restructuring United\r\nNations Information Centres through their\r\nconsolidation into regional hubs, starting with Western\r\nEuropean countries.\r\nHowever, we have serious doubts about the idea\r\nof integrating the United Nations libraries under the\r\numbrella of the Dag Hammarskjöld Library in New\r\nYork and assigning it the function of policy setting and\r\ncoordinating the work in this area of the Organization’s\r\nactivities. To be perfectly frank, this kind of rigid\r\ncentralization will only harm the efficiency of library\r\nservices designed for the benefit of the Member States\r\nand weaken the United Nations role in providing these\r\nservices to other international organizations, non-\r\ngovernmental institutions and the public. Local\r\nspecificity, which is important for the fruitful use of\r\nthese libraries, would be lost. Therefore, we deem it\r\nnecessary to study this proposal in all its aspects and in\r\ndetail, first of all from the standpoint of the\r\nconsequences implied in these changes.\r\nAs for the report’s section on improving\r\nconference services, our assumption is that the set of\r\naction proposed will be considered during the\r\ndiscussion of the annual resolution of the General\r\nAssembly on the pattern of conferences. At this stage\r\nwe wish to stress the importance of preserving and\r\nstrengthening the existing United Nations principles of\r\nconference services and the division of authority and\r\nfunctions between the corresponding departments in\r\nNew York and the United Nations offices in Vienna,\r\nGeneva and Nairobi in this area.\r\nIt was somewhat unexpected for us to see in some\r\nsections of the new Secretary-General’s report on\r\nreforms a trend towards centralizing functions, powers\r\nand lines of authority in the areas of conference\r\nservices and public information. Furthermore, Action\r\n32 and the section on further efforts to improve\r\nmanagement speak of developing, not curtailing, the\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nconcept of the delegation of authority. Besides that,\r\n“the premise that giving managers more authority and\r\nresponsibility for decision-making is essential ... to the\r\nimprovement of the management of human and\r\nfinancial resources” (A/55/270, para. 1) was used as a\r\nbasis for the 1997 reform proposals — this is a\r\nquotation from the 2000 Secretary-General’s report\r\n“Accountability and responsibility” (A/55/270). We\r\nbelieve that the reforms conducted in the United\r\nNations should be consistent here too.\r\nWe welcome the intention of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit a carefully revised programme\r\nbudget for the biennium 2004-2005 to reflect new\r\npriorities of the Organization. It is important that its\r\nlimited resources be apportioned in such a way as to\r\nmake it possible to identify outdated and ineffective\r\nprogrammes and activities. In this regard, we look\r\nforward to specific proposals from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nWe would also like to note that the problem of\r\nshortcomings in the programming and budgeting\r\nprocess has been correctly identified in the report and,\r\nindeed, specific steps should be worked out to remove\r\nthem. In this context, the Secretary-General proposes a\r\nnumber of drastic changes — more strategic budget\r\nwith supplementary details provided separately;\r\nmedium-term plans covering two rather than four years\r\ncombined with the budget outline; and concentration of\r\nintergovernmental review of plans and budgets in the\r\nFifth Committee. All of this need to be carefully\r\nstudied, along with the proposal to give him authority\r\nto reallocate up to ten percent of budget resources.\r\nIn this connection, we believe it is important to\r\nsubmit additional and more detailed material on these\r\nissues to the Fifth Committee through the Advisory\r\nCommittee for Administrative and Budgetary\r\nQuestions (ACABQ).\r\nWe regret to note that the part of the report\r\ndedicated to personnel questions does not contain long-\r\nawaited proposals for radical reform of the United\r\nNations contractual system and improvement of the\r\nperformance evaluation system. We reaffirm that the\r\nkey to effective reform of human resources\r\nmanagement lies in complete abandonment of the\r\nsystem of permanent contracts and a switch to non-\r\ncareer service, which would make it possible to shift\r\nhuman resources flexibly and efficiently.\r\nThe ideas contained in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on transforming human resources policy — for\r\nexample, developing new approaches to staff\r\nrecruitment and compensation in field locations and\r\nincreasing departure packages and resources for staff\r\nretraining — should be viewed from the perspective of\r\ntheir additional financial implications. We cannot agree\r\nwith the conclusion that the United Nations needs a\r\nmore competitive system of pay and benefits. We\r\nregard the review of the system being conducted by the\r\nInternational Civil Service Commission (ICSC) as a\r\npurely creative quest for possibilities to enhance the\r\nefficiency of work of the Secretariat.\r\nIn order to enable Member States to take a\r\ndecision on the proposed reform package, an effective\r\nworking mechanism should be established, such as\r\ninformal plenary consultations of the General\r\nAssembly conducted by its President. Within such a\r\nmechanism it would be possible to agree upon a draft\r\nresolution on the Secretary-General’s reform proposals\r\nthat would provide significant impetus to further\r\nreform of the Organization. Russia, for its part, is\r\nprepared to participate actively and constructively in\r\nsuch consultations.\r\nMr. Effah-Apenteng (Ghana): Permit me to\r\nbegin by associating my delegation with the statements\r\nmade on behalf of the African Group by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Egypt, in his capacity as its\r\nChairman for the month of October, and by the\r\nrepresentative of Venezuela on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/57/387), entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change,” containing 36\r\nactions. We hope that the outcome of the consideration\r\nof these second-generation reform initiatives, at this\r\nhigh level, will help unleash a new burst of\r\nimprovements to the management culture of the United\r\nNations and enhance the effectiveness with which the\r\nOrganization implements mandates. I also hope it will\r\nhelp free the Secretary-General from the tired notion\r\nthat additional budgetary resources cannot be provided\r\nby Member States for the increasing mandates, as\r\ncapacity exists for further efficiency gains.\r\nIn this regard, we note that while some of the\r\nactions are exploratory in nature and will require\r\nfurther study before consideration at a later stage, a\r\nnumber of them have immediate effect upon approval.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nWe also distinguish between proposals that lie well\r\nwithin the purview of the Secretary-General and those\r\nfor which intergovernmental approval is required.\r\nI intend during this intervention to speak to\r\nvarious actions that have been recommended by the\r\nSecretary-General. However, before doing that, let me\r\nindicate that my delegation has taken note of the\r\nSecretary-General’s observations on the additional\r\nwork required on issues such as the revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the enhancement of the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the process of Security Council\r\nreform. We recognize that those matters lie within our\r\npurview as Member States, and my delegation\r\naccordingly commits itself to work in concert with\r\nother delegations to that end also.\r\nIn respect of action 1, which is intended to bring\r\nthe current programme budget in line with the priorities\r\nagreed to at the Millennium Assembly, let me indicate\r\nthat Ghana affirms its support for that proposed action.\r\nIn our view, the intention is consistent with the results-\r\nbased budgeting system, which is results-oriented and\r\nshould reflect the priorities of the United Nations. My\r\ndelegation further believes that since the medium-term\r\nplan, which forms a set of priority issues over the\r\nmedium term, is not supposed to be static and is indeed\r\nsubject to review every two years, the action being\r\ncontemplated should be undertaken within the existing\r\nmechanism, and should be aimed at reflecting not only\r\nthe priorities agreed to in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nbut also the implementation mechanisms derived from\r\nfollow-up meetings, such as the Monterrey Consensus,\r\nthe Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, the Programme of Action of\r\nthe Third United Nations Conference on the Least\r\nDeveloped Countries, and others.\r\nThe proposals of the Secretary-General in actions\r\n2 to 5, concerning measures to strengthen human\r\nrights, are laudable, and my delegation is in a position\r\nto endorse the proposals for implementation. It is our\r\nbelief that universal principles of human rights require\r\neffective national action. Thus, countries that need\r\nassistance should be supported in developing national\r\ncapacities on the standards and norms of\r\ninternationally agreed human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. My delegation is, however, uncomfortable\r\nwith the suggestion that human rights be integrated into\r\nthe country programmes of the World Bank, as this\r\ncould shift focus away from the core issue of\r\ndevelopment financing. In any event, such an action\r\nwould require further study and assessment.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the intention of action 3\r\nto streamline the reporting procedures under the treaty\r\nbodies on human rights. The dearth of reports\r\nsubmitted by Member States reflects the burden of\r\nreporting and undermines efforts towards the effective\r\npromotion of human rights. We look forward to the\r\nconsultations that the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights would carry out with\r\ntreaty bodies in that regard, and to his subsequent\r\nreport.\r\nGhana has always viewed as important the role of\r\nthe special procedures in the promotion and protection\r\nof international human rights. We therefore support\r\nefforts to enhance the effectiveness of that mechanism,\r\nin ways that would cause the current controversies\r\nabout the outcome of the work of special procedures to\r\nabate, by avoiding actions that are perceived as\r\narbitrary and by the formulation of uniform guidelines\r\nor rules of procedure.\r\nIn all this, and with an eye for the effective\r\nmanagement of programme activities, we note that a\r\nreliable source of funding establishes a predictable\r\nbasis for long-term planning. We therefore look\r\nforward to the report of the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services, which we hope will focus on ways\r\nof strengthening the fund-raising activities of the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, freeing it of the restrictive\r\nconditionalities that some donors tie to funding\r\nactivities, which, in some measure, has led to the\r\nfragmentation of programme activities.\r\nThe importance of the public information\r\nfunction of the work of the United Nations is better\r\nappreciated when one realizes that the United Nations\r\nhas a relationship not merely with Governments of\r\nMember States, but with all the peoples of the world,\r\nmost of whom look up to this Organization with great\r\nexpectations. My delegation is therefore able to support\r\nthe Secretary-General’s intention to restructure the\r\nDepartment of Pubic Information in ways that can\r\nincrease its effectiveness as the mouthpiece of the\r\nUnited Nations. We also support the evaluation activity\r\nto be carried out by the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices over a three-year period, as this can provide a\r\nscientific and objective basis for ascertaining the\r\nimpact and cost-effectiveness of various United\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nNations media outputs. We, however, urge that the\r\nimpact analysis of the output of the Department of\r\nPublic Information should cover all relevant concerns,\r\nincluding the needs of societies and peoples in all their\r\nwide diversity, and their capacities to access the media\r\noutputs.\r\nGhana supports the concept of regional hubs,\r\nstarting with the consolidation of the 13 information\r\ncentres in Western Europe, as it holds the potential to\r\nfree resources from high-cost but low-impact areas for\r\nallocation to other strategic locations. We caution,\r\nhowever, that in Africa, for instance, the wide expanse\r\nof the region and the particular subregional concerns\r\nmay require subregional hubs to be considered as an\r\nalternative option.\r\nMy delegation can also endorse implementation\r\nof action 9, aimed at improving the management of\r\nUnited Nations libraries, and stressing the need to\r\nadhere to the stated pledge that further movement\r\ntowards the enhanced use of an electronic\r\ndocumentation and distribution system would not in\r\nany way constrain the access of less capable end users,\r\nincluding permanent missions, to hard-copy versions of\r\ndocuments and collections.\r\nRegarding improvements to publications,\r\nhowever, my delegation is in a position to endorse\r\nimplementation of action 10, except sub-action (d),\r\nwhich calls for the cessation of the publication by the\r\nUnited Nations of the Repertory of Practice of United\r\nNations Organs. My delegation believes that the\r\ndifficulties associated with clearing the backlog of\r\nvolumes of the Repertory and the problems related to\r\nthe internal capacity to publish should not excuse the\r\nexisting obligation in that regard. Ghana commends the\r\nefforts of the Office of Legal Affairs to establish a web\r\nsite for an electronic version of the Repertory. We call\r\nfor equal treatment of the Repertory and the Repertoire\r\nof the Practice of the Security Council, and we urge\r\nthat exhaustive consideration be given to all options,\r\nincluding a previous proposal of the Office of Internal\r\nOversight Services for a central Repertory section as\r\nwell as the establishment and maintenance of a trust\r\nfund to provide dedicated resources that can fund posts\r\non a long-term basis to facilitate the preparation of\r\nvolumes for publication.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s proposals relating to\r\nactions 11 to 13 are interesting but will require further\r\nconsideration, as they have more direct impact on the\r\nnegotiating capacity of Member States. Ghana could,\r\nhowever, endorse implementation of action 11, which\r\naims to improve reporting, subject to the approval by\r\nthe General Assembly, of clearly defined criteria to\r\nguide the process. It is our view that the drive for\r\nbrevity should not obscure our clear need for\r\ninformation based on all the available and relevant\r\nfacts concerning a particular matter. In addition, even\r\nas my delegation notes the challenges posed by action\r\n12, we can commit to working with other delegations\r\non the establishment of a mechanism to review the\r\ncontinuing need and the frequency of recurring\r\nreporting requirements.\r\nWith regard to action 13, Ghana can support the\r\nSecretary-General’s intention to strengthen the capacity\r\nof the Department of General Assembly Affairs and\r\nConference Management to deliver cost-effective\r\nmeetings and conference services, through, inter alia,\r\nenhanced utilization of globally available United\r\nNations resources. My delegation, however, notes the\r\nrelationship between the proposals contained in the\r\nreport under discussion and the additional measures of\r\ndocument A/57/289. It is not our expectation that\r\napproval granted with respect to the current action\r\nwould necessarily extend to the measures contained in\r\nthat document.\r\nAn indication of the effectiveness of the United\r\nNations is, more often than not, reflected by the\r\nmanner in which it is able to galvanize its rich\r\nreservoir of knowledge and skills and to bring them to\r\nbear on any given issue. Today, the range of issues of\r\nconcern to Member States has increased, and their\r\nresolution is ever so critical to the well-being of so\r\nmany. Ghana, therefore, supports further\r\nimplementation of measures to strengthen the\r\neffectiveness of the presence of the United Nations in\r\ndeveloping countries through enhanced coordination\r\nmechanisms, which must embrace country ownership\r\nand leadership. We also look forward to the document\r\nto be published in September 2003 clarifying roles and\r\nresponsibilities in the area of technical cooperation.\r\nActions 16 and 17, concerning the envisaged\r\nrestructuring of the Department of Economic and\r\nSocial Affairs, are welcome, and we look forward to\r\nadditional information on the value-added role\r\nanticipated by the proposed post of a third Assistant\r\nSecretary-General. Ghana endorses implementation of\r\naction 17 and advocates that the policy planning unit\r\nbe an adjunct to the Office of the Under-Secretary-\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nGeneral, which should lead policy development within\r\nthe Department of Economic and Social Affairs in a\r\nconsistent and coherent manner.\r\nThe proposed restructuring of the Office of the\r\nAdviser for Special Assignments in Africa is\r\nsignificant, as it seeks to consolidate into a single high-\r\nprofile office the currently scattered units dealing\r\nsolely with issues related to Africa. We trust that such a\r\nrestructuring, which would reflect the priority of Africa\r\nin the medium-term plan, would assume the required\r\npermanency in so far as Africa continues to be a\r\npriority consideration of the Assembly. In that respect,\r\nwe envisage that the funding mechanism for that office\r\nmay require an adjustment of its current allocation\r\nunder special political missions. Furthermore, my\r\ndelegation hopes that the wording of action 18, which\r\ndefines the scope of the functions of the Office of the\r\nAdviser solely in terms of the General Assembly and\r\nits subsidiary bodies, was merely inadvertent and not a\r\ndeliberate decision to restrict its role to the General\r\nAssembly while excluding the Security Council. Other\r\nforums, such as the Economic and Social Council, exist\r\nand are important to the interests of Africa.\r\nIn the light of the important contributions that\r\ncivil society groups and the private sector can make to\r\nthe achievement of some of the core objectives of the\r\nUnited Nations, Ghana is in a position to endorse\r\nactions 19 and 20 for implementation, with the\r\nunderstanding that such implementation would proceed\r\nin conformity with existing legislative requirements\r\nand that substantive proposals to that end would bear in\r\nmind the international character of the United Nations\r\nand would be consistent with the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter.\r\nWith regard to actions 21 to 23, my delegation\r\nviews as positive the commitment to review on a\r\ncontinuous basis the process for allocating resources.\r\nWe are ready to consider each proposed action on its\r\nown merit. We believe it is necessary, however, to\r\naffirm our support for the medium-term plan as it\r\ncurrently exists and to express our doubts as to the\r\nusefulness of replacing it with a short-term plan, which\r\nthe biennial budget represents. As the strategic\r\ndocument for envisioning the objectives of the\r\nOrganization, we believe that the medium-term plan —\r\nwhich guides the focus of implementation of the\r\nprioritized objectives that are translated into biennial\r\nbudgets — should be driven by all stakeholders,\r\nincluding the relevant substantive Main Committees\r\nand the Secretariat. Its development should thus\r\noriginate from and be endorsed by the relevant Main\r\nCommittees.\r\nMy delegation can, however, support a budget\r\noutline that is prepared to reflect the four-year\r\nmedium-term plan, but only with the understanding\r\nthat, whereas the first two years would be firm outlines\r\nand subject to approval by the General Assembly, the\r\nremaining two years would serve only as indicative\r\noutlines of future resource requirements. Ghana could\r\nalso consider supporting a shorter, but adequate and\r\nmore strategic, budget if the supplementary details to\r\nbe provided separately were easily accessible and did\r\nnot detract from our capacity to take well-informed\r\ndecisions.\r\nRegarding the strengthening of the system of\r\nevaluation and monitoring, my delegation sees that as\r\nan integral part of the results-based budgeting system\r\nand understands that, in order to operate a flexible\r\nsystem up front, accountability mechanisms would\r\nhave to be strong downstream. We therefore look\r\nforward to the proposals concerning evaluation and\r\nmonitoring, particularly an evaluation system in which\r\nfinancial performance and programme implementation\r\nwould be reviewed in an integrated manner, to gain a\r\nbetter appreciation of what results are being achieved\r\nand at what cost, and to help answer questions such as\r\nwhether a lack of funding accounts for the non-\r\nachievement of a set objective.\r\nWe look forward to further clarifications on\r\naction 22, and we intend to discuss with other\r\ndelegations how the objective to consolidate within the\r\nFifth Committee all aspects of the budget decision-\r\nmaking process will be pursued, if its merits warrant\r\nthat. We equally look forward to the new format for\r\npeacekeeping budgets that the Secretary-General\r\nintends to develop, consistent, we hope, with the\r\nlegislative requirement for a more results-oriented\r\nbudgeting format that better justifies the allocation of\r\nresources.\r\nGhana supports action 25, aimed at enhancing\r\nstaff mobility across the United Nations system. We\r\nwould, however, like to stress that mobility should be\r\npromoted, not merely as a solution to staffing\r\nconstraints in some duty stations, but also, among other\r\nthings, as a means to developing the experience\r\nnecessary to shape the views of senior professionals.\r\nWe can also support action 26, which proposes lifting\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nthe restrictions on the numbers of General Service staff\r\neligible for promotion to the Professional category,\r\nwith the understanding that the proposed increase of\r\nthe annual quota of P-2 posts available for successful\r\nGeneral Service examinations candidates would not in\r\nany way distort the prime consideration that the\r\ncomposition of the Professional grades of staff of the\r\nUnited Nations should reflect fairly the broad\r\ngeographical distribution of Member States.\r\nGhana could be in a position to support action 27,\r\nconcerning proposed changes to the functions and the\r\ncareer prospects of the General Service staff, and\r\naction 28, which would change the status of all\r\nemployees of the United Nations Secretariat to\r\ninternational civil servants. However, we seek further\r\nclarification as to how they would affect the Fleming\r\nprinciple and its cost-saving elements.\r\nMy delegation is also in a position to support the\r\nflexible working arrangements proposed in action 29,\r\ninsofar as it relates only to existing staff and does not\r\nbecome a consideration in the decision to employ new\r\nstaff. The United Nations is a universal Organization\r\nand, as a result, nationals of all countries, developing\r\nand developed, should have equal opportunity to work\r\nfor it.\r\nFinally, my delegation is in a position to endorse\r\nactions 30 to 36, subject to a few clarifications which\r\nwe will pursue during the informal consultations on the\r\nmatter. Let me, however, indicate that we look forward\r\nto the active engagement of the Ombudsman in the\r\nresolution of disputes between management and staff.\r\nWe hope that the Office will be given the necessary\r\nsupport to enable it fulfil its intended purpose.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating my\r\ndelegation’s support for these actions submitted by the\r\nSecretary-General and to indicate our commitment to\r\nworking with other delegations on them.\r\nMr. Takahashi (Japan): The advancement of\r\nglobalization has resulted in unprecedented\r\nopportunities for exchanges and greater mutual\r\nunderstanding among people of different cultures.\r\nIndeed, globalization has brought benefits to many. At\r\nthe same time, we recognize that there are many people\r\nwho have not benefited from globalization and who are\r\nleading unfulfilling lives. Under these circumstances,\r\nthere are many situations in which existing rules\r\ngoverning human activities that cross national borders\r\nare inadequate. The States Members of the United\r\nNations must summon the wisdom to revitalize the\r\nfunctions of the Organization and ensure that it is able\r\nto respond to the challenges of the present era. The first\r\nstep towards this goal is to ensure the accountability of\r\nthe United Nations itself and to reform it by setting\r\nclear agendas. The Government of Japan expresses its\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\ninitiative in promoting United Nations reform.\r\nLet me begin by offering Japan’s views and\r\nexpectations with respect to the Secretary-General’s\r\nreform proposal.\r\nFirst, if a General Assembly resolution is adopted\r\nat an early stage to provide guidance and momentum\r\nfor reform as a whole, as recommended in the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General, Japan would support such a\r\nresolution. Secondly, Japan encourages the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to expeditiously implement those elements of\r\nreform that are solely under his authority and in\r\naccordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions\r\nalready adopted. Thirdly, once a reform is introduced,\r\nwe, the Member States, should follow up the\r\nimplementation process in an appropriate and timely\r\nmanner and verify the results.\r\nNow, I would like to convey Japan’s views on\r\nseveral areas covered in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThe Government of Japan attaches particular\r\nimportance to the following four points.\r\nFirst, Japan considers that it is crucial for the\r\nUnited Nations to realign its programmes according to\r\nthe new agenda defined through the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and through major global conferences.\r\nThis programme review should be reflected in the\r\n2004-2005 regular budget of the United Nations. Clear\r\npriority-setting and the identification of offset savings\r\nshould be undertaken in reviewing the budgeting and\r\nplanning process for enhanced flexibility and\r\neffectiveness. The explanation of this point by Deputy\r\nSecretary-General Fréchette last week was\r\nencouraging.\r\nWe believe it is essential in this regard to allocate\r\nresources to high-priority activities by redeploying\r\nresources from low-priority and obsolete activities. The\r\nGovernment of Japan fully expects that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral will identify and propose activities that could\r\nbe discontinued or terminated. This would have further\r\nimportance in light of the possible increase in the\r\ncurrent budget. If these efforts do not succeed and, as a\r\nresult, the size of the United Nations budget continues\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nto expand, Japan, which contributes one fifth of the\r\nregular budget, will be in a difficult position in terms\r\nof its accountability to its taxpayers.\r\nLet me explain the budgetary process of the\r\nJapanese Government. In this process, the director of\r\neach section of Japan’s ministries plays an important\r\nrole in setting priorities and specifying activities to be\r\nscrapped due to budgetary constraints. Japanese\r\ntaxpayers certainly expect a similar course to be\r\nfollowed in the budgetary process of the United\r\nNations. We therefore support the initiative for sunset\r\nprovisions proposed in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nSecondly, the Government of Japan wishes to\r\nunderline the importance of improving the management\r\nof the Office of the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights (OHCHR) and looks forward to a concrete and\r\neffective proposal from the High Commissioner to this\r\nend. The OHCHR should make every effort to promote\r\ncollaboration with other United Nations organs,\r\ninstitutes and specialized agencies, while ensuring\r\nconsistency in their respective mandates and upholding\r\nthe fundamental concepts of human rights in the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThirdly, Japan attaches particular importance to\r\nthe realization of the principle of equitable\r\ngeographical distribution with regard to the Secretariat\r\nstaff. In order to resolve the issue of non-representation\r\nor under-representation, Japan expects the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to develop a programme and set specific\r\ntargets for achieving equitable geographical\r\ndistribution, as requested by resolution 55/258. The\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on human resources\r\nmanagement reform, in document A/57/293, does not\r\nfully address this request, and we look forward to a full\r\nreport during the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nWith regard to the proposal for lifting the\r\nrestrictions on the number of General Service staff\r\neligible for promotion to the Professional category,\r\nJapan does not think that opportunities for such\r\npromotions should be ensured by increasing the ratio of\r\nrecruitment from the General Service to the\r\nProfessional category. Rather, Japan considers it\r\nappropriate to increase opportunities for recruitment to\r\nthe Professional level through national competitive\r\nexaminations and the General Service-to-Professional\r\ncategory examinations by changing the top-heavy post\r\nstructure of the Secretariat to a structure that is more\r\npyramid-shaped, as mentioned in resolution 51/241 and\r\nreaffirmed in resolution 56/253.\r\nFourthly, from the viewpoint of increasing the\r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the United Nations, the\r\nGovernment of Japan expects further coordination in\r\nthe field among the United Nations system and other\r\nplayers, and the streamlining of reports and conference\r\nmanagement.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s focus on\r\nUnited Nations efforts in the field of development. The\r\nGovernment of Japan hopes to deepen the discussion\r\nregarding the integrated and coordinated follow-up of a\r\nseries of major international conferences in the field of\r\ndevelopment, including the International Conference\r\non Financing for Development and the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development, and on how to realize the\r\ngoals of such conferences. The Government of Japan\r\nexpects that the deliberations which are taking place\r\nunder other agenda items will contribute to the reform\r\nof the United Nations as a whole.\r\nLast but not least, I would like to comment on the\r\nreform of the Security Council. The present report does\r\nnot cover the necessary changes within international\r\nintergovernmental organs, such as the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council, that a Working Group has been\r\nexamining. This is, however, a very important task in\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral noted in paragraph 20 of his report (document\r\nA/57/387), “no reform of the United Nations would be\r\ncomplete without reform of the Security Council”.\r\nIt is both possible and necessary to enlarge the\r\nSecurity Council without diminishing its effectiveness.\r\nNext year, the debate on Security Council reform will\r\nenter its tenth year. The Government of Japan believes\r\nthat, as the first practical step, we should now focus\r\nour discussion on such questions as the number of seats\r\non an enlarged Security Council. Japan intends to work\r\nhard in this regard.\r\nWe anticipate that the present report will provide\r\nfurther momentum to the discussions and we look\r\nforward to the Secretary-General’s active engagement\r\nin this matter.\r\nThe Government of Japan is confident that our\r\nefforts to reform the United Nations will result in a\r\nmore effective and efficient Organization. Japan is\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\ndetermined to work together with the United Nations\r\nand its Member States to realize this goal.\r\nMr. Yuchengco (Philippines): Today’s\r\nenvironment tells us that many of the challenges we\r\nface as nations are actually collective concerns which\r\nrequire collective responses. We believe that the United\r\nNations remains the most important international body\r\nfor generating the necessary multilateral and collective\r\naction to address the myriad of international challenges\r\nbefore us. The strengthening of the United Nations is,\r\ntherefore, an essential aspect of our work.\r\nMy delegation is pleased to address the General\r\nAssembly on this agenda item and to acknowledge the\r\nSecretary-General’s initiatives in his unrelenting\r\npursuit of an Organization that is united in purpose and\r\nexemplary in performance.\r\nThe quick tempo of world events requires the\r\nUnited Nations to maintain its step, to be quick in\r\nidentifying problem areas and to institute\r\nimprovements in its system of accomplishing its\r\nobjectives. There is scope for simplifying procedures\r\nand processes, for developing a good pool of talented\r\nand trained personnel and for maximizing the benefits\r\nof information technology. In this regard, we have\r\nelected to keep an open mind and welcome many of the\r\nactions proposed by the Secretary-General in his report\r\nentitled, “Strengthening of the United Nations: an\r\nagenda for further change” (document A/57/387).\r\nIn particular, we welcome the measures proposed\r\nby the Secretary-General to improve coordination in\r\nthe United Nations system so as to minimize or\r\neliminate duplication, be they in activities, reports or\r\npublications. Better coordination should redound not\r\nonly to the streamlining of the work of the Secretariat\r\nand of the intergovernmental bodies, but more\r\nimportantly, to the efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\nOrganization. We also recognize that better\r\ncoordination will improve policy development and\r\nplanning.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that there is scope for coordinating and\r\nrationalizing work programmes and reports. We have\r\ntaken note of the Secretary-General’s proposal to\r\nachieve this and would be interested to see how related\r\nsubjects could be consolidated.\r\nLikewise, there is scope for simplifying\r\nprocesses, and we look forward to reviewing a\r\nprogramme budget that will better reflect the priorities\r\nof the United Nations in a streamlined format that is\r\naccessible to readers other than experts. We expect that\r\nthe new format will allow for a less tedious\r\ndeliberation of the budget and yet allow for a more\r\nsubstantive debate on its programmatic content.\r\nMy delegation believes that the Organization\r\nmust have the human resource capacity to implement\r\nthe proposed changes. There is a constant need for\r\nupgrading this capacity by providing appropriate\r\nincentives and opportunities to enable the Organization\r\nto maintain the best pool of talent and to take the\r\nnecessary measures to continue the upgrading of skills.\r\nMy delegation also appreciates the need for\r\neffective communication of the United Nations\r\nmessage to sustain the support of the international\r\ncommunity for the noble work of our Organization.\r\nWhile millions of people in the world may know of the\r\nexistence of the United Nations, few have a full\r\nawareness of the critical role it plays in our lives and\r\nthe activities it undertakes to promote development and\r\nmaintain international peace and security. There is a\r\nneed to support its work by getting the correct message\r\nout through appropriate publications and\r\ncommunications.\r\nReform may have different connotations. My\r\ndelegation would like to see it as a continuing\r\nimprovement of a system, rather than just change for\r\nthe sake of change or as a cost-cutting measure. At the\r\nsame time, providing clear goals and processes is\r\nnecessary in order to eliminate any anxieties we may\r\nhave in instituting new approaches. We have followed\r\nthe reform process throughout the past decade and\r\nbelieve that transparency, accountability and universal\r\nparticipation have proven to be the best way of\r\nachieving concrete results and ensuring support for\r\nreform. We are, therefore, pleased that the\r\nconsideration of the Secretary-General’s report will be\r\nundertaken through a more informal and open-ended\r\nprocess of dialogue and exchange of views.\r\nMy delegation supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts at reform and will participate constructively in\r\nthe work ahead. In this regard, there are some\r\npreliminary views we wish to express. First of all, the\r\ndecision-making process on the Secretary-General’s\r\nagenda for further change should be open and\r\ntransparent so as to ensure the widest possible\r\nparticipation.\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nSecondly, through a process of open dialogue,\r\ndelegations should be able to distinguish between the\r\nactions that are within the Secretary-General’s mandate\r\nand thus ready for immediate implementation, and the\r\nactions requiring endorsement or action by the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThirdly, we should try to conclude our work on\r\nthis item as expeditiously as possible, but we must also\r\nbear in mind that reform is an ongoing process; some\r\nactions may need time to develop or study. Hasty\r\ndecisions must be avoided.\r\nAnd finally, although my delegation is open to the\r\ncontent of any resolution on this item, we believe that\r\nit should aim more at providing broad and strategic\r\ndirection for further work on certain actions at a more\r\ndetailed level, rather than aim at specificity at this\r\ntime, although specifics may be necessary in some\r\ncases. Such an outcome would be in line with our view\r\nthat United Nations reform is an ongoing process.\r\nTwo years ago during the Millennium Summit,\r\nour leaders gathered in this Assembly to reaffirm their\r\nfaith in the ability of the Organization and its Charter\r\nto create a prosperous, peaceful and just world. The\r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations each have\r\nimportant roles to play in this regard. This is especially\r\ntrue of the only universal organ, the General Assembly.\r\nIt is therefore essential that we seek to revitalize the\r\nGeneral Assembly so that it can reaffirm its central\r\nposition as the chief policy-making organ of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation further believes that the General\r\nAssembly remains the only principal United Nations\r\norgan in which the principle of sovereign equality\r\namong States is respected and observed. It is the only\r\nprincipal organ in which all Member States participate\r\nequally and democratically in the decision-making\r\nprocess. Moreover, the General Assembly’s mandate\r\ncovers all aspects of multilateral cooperation,\r\nespecially promoting and sustaining economic growth\r\nand development and maintaining international peace\r\nand security. It must therefore continuously be in a\r\nposition to assert these roles.\r\nIt is timely and appropriate that the issue of the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly be placed once\r\nagain on the United Nations agenda of priorities. It is\r\nalso linked in many ways to the proposed agenda for\r\nfurther change of the Secretary-General.\r\nWhile a number of United Nations reform and\r\nstrengthening exercises have been undertaken and\r\nconcluded over the past 10 years, the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly needs to be further enhanced, both\r\ninternally and in terms of more meaningful interaction\r\nwith the other United Nations organs, in particular the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Philippines remains committed to pursuing the\r\nmany agreed but yet to be implemented measures\r\ntowards achieving this goal. In particular, we would\r\nlike to see implementation of the salient features of\r\nresolutions 51/241 and 55/285, especially paragraph 14\r\nof 55/285, which mandates further action to be taken\r\non the basis of the debate on the report on the work of\r\nthe Organization; and paragraphs 18 and 19 of\r\nresolution 55/285, which deal, respectively, with the\r\npreparation of reports and scheduling of meetings and\r\nwith the greater use by the President of facilitators,\r\nwhere appropriate.\r\nIt is also important to consider ways and means\r\nof implementing paragraph 12 of resolution 51/241,\r\nwhich mandates informal consultations under the\r\nPresident or one of the Vice-Presidents to discuss the\r\ncontent of any action by the Assembly based on the\r\ndebate on the annual report of the Security Council to\r\nthe General Assembly. Revitalizing and improving the\r\nefficiency of the General Assembly should therefore be\r\nbased on or take off from previously agreed resolutions\r\non revitalization in order to determine whether they are\r\nbeing implemented or to consider the extent to which\r\nthey have been implemented with a view to possible\r\nfurther action. New and innovative measures should\r\nalso be considered. We also view the non-paper of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at the fifty-sixth\r\nsession, dated 6 June 2002, as an additional input into\r\nthe exercise on revitalizing and strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations at this session.\r\nRevitalizing the General Assembly, as envisioned\r\nby the founding fathers of the United Nations and as\r\nresonated by our leaders during the Millennium\r\nSummit two years ago, would reaffirm our faith in the\r\nOrganization and our commitment to promoting\r\ndemocracy among nations and international\r\ncooperation as the main vehicle for addressing the\r\nglobal challenges of our time.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Over the past\r\ndecades, the United Nations international and global\r\nagendas have expanded many-fold. The great\r\nconferences of the 1990s added to this unprecedented\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nscale and dimension. The United Nations needed to be\r\nrestructured, revitalized and retooled to discharge its\r\nburgeoning responsibilities. It was therefore apt for the\r\nSecretary-General to respond to these needs by\r\npresenting his reform proposals. Through this, he has\r\ndemonstrated wisdom, vision and commitment. He has\r\nalso thereby vindicated the confidence reposed by us in\r\nhim. We thank him for the initiative and also for his\r\nsuccinct presentation of his report this morning.\r\nWe see these proposals as part of the process\r\ninitiated in 1997. An immediate concern was the\r\nestablishment of managerial efficiency. It is hence\r\nnatural that we focus attention on rationalization of\r\nstructures, optimal utilization of resources, elimination\r\nof duplication, reinforcement of coordination and\r\nintroduction of benchmarks for performance\r\nevaluation, but there are other concerns as well. We\r\nbelieve that the changes should bring forth\r\nimprovement in the Organization’s capacity to deliver\r\nmore effectively. They should also enhance the ability\r\nof the United Nations to reflect the aspirations of\r\nnations and peoples. This should, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said, be a process, rather than a one-off\r\nevent.\r\nThe statement made by the representative of\r\nVenezuela, as Chair of the Group of 77, reflected our\r\nbroad views on and expectations of the report. May I\r\nnow take this opportunity to make a few additional\r\ncomments on the report.\r\nHuman rights is one area where Bangladesh sees\r\nmerit in the proposed measures, particularly when they\r\nrelate to supporting countries in building strong human\r\nrights institutions and to reviewing the special\r\nprocedures and those of the treaty bodies. While the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner prepares his report\r\nnext year, we would expect that the Member States will\r\nbe appropriately consulted.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s proposals to\r\nhave closer collaboration with civil society. The\r\nproposed creation of a panel of eminent persons is\r\ncommendable. We welcome the measures proposed in\r\nthe area of public information and documentation. In\r\nour view, these aim at creating a culture of\r\ncommunications in the Organization. We recognize the\r\nneed for focused, well-clarified reporting. We are ready\r\nto work on the improvements in this area involving\r\nnew techniques and technologies. One cannot turn\r\naway from so many improved tools and methods\r\navailable to us, which are far more numerous than they\r\nwere even a decade back.\r\nAt the same time, we also need to recognize that\r\nan intergovernmental organization such as the United\r\nNations has Member States with diverse requirements.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to factor in the diverse\r\nrequirements of the Members the Organization serves.\r\nWe endorse the proposals to have focused reports.\r\nIndeed, that is needed for the reports to be more\r\nimaginative and analytical in addressing issues. This is\r\nparticularly true for reports in the areas of social\r\ndevelopment and economic development, which cross-\r\ncut each other. But proposed consolidated reports\r\nmight involve questions related to timing and\r\nsequencing with the work of various Committees and\r\nbodies. We would appreciate a further elaboration on\r\nthis aspect. Economic and social development is one\r\narea to which my delegation obviously attaches great\r\nimportance. We welcome the proposal for greater\r\ncoherence aimed at better service delivery in that broad\r\nsector. The proposed modalities, such as joint\r\nprogramming and resource-pooling, are noteworthy.\r\nWe expect such improvements to better support\r\ndevelopment and humanitarian programmes,\r\nparticularly at the country level. I would, in this\r\nconnection, draw attention to the Brussels Programme\r\nof Action adopted at the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).\r\nThat Programme of Action is quite elaborate and\r\nclearly delineates actions to be taken by the LDCs and\r\nthe international community. We are at the initial stage\r\nof its implementation and hope the proposed measures\r\nwill also contribute to the efforts undertaken within the\r\nparameters of the Brussels Programme of Action.\r\nA detailed report on technical cooperation is due\r\nnext year. Still, while outlining the broad principles for\r\ndefining roles and responsibilities among United\r\nNations entities, the current report mentions that\r\n“... technical cooperation should be delivered ... by the\r\nentities that have an established field presence and\r\nexperience”. (A/57/387, para. 124 (d))\r\nAt this stage, let me underline that there are a\r\nnumber of funds and programmes, for instance\r\nUNCTAD, that lack a field presence. We greatly\r\nbenefit from their activities and value their work. That\r\nis why, I would stress, in any re-orientation of support\r\nto Member States, the programmatic impact on most\r\ndeveloping countries should be appropriately weighed.\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.39\r\nI would also stress that, on many occasions, it is\r\ndifficult to measure the stage of accomplishment\r\nreached by a programme activity. This is particularly so\r\nin the social and economic areas. This must be\r\nconsidered when deciding on programme closures.\r\nIn this Organization, the role of the planning and\r\nbudgetary process cannot be over emphasized.\r\nCurrently, the four-year medium-term plan serves\r\nas the principal policy directive for the United Nations.\r\nAfter meticulous examination by the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination (CPC), the plan is\r\nadopted and reviewed by the General Assembly. In\r\ndoing so, all relevant mandates are taken into account.\r\nFor example, just this summer, as CPC reviewed the\r\ncurrent plan, it incorporated the relevant Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We are ready to see how CPC’s\r\nworking methods could be further improved.\r\nRelated to CPC is the issue of the medium-term\r\nplan and its priorities. If the Millennium Development\r\nGoals are to be the central set of goals, some\r\nelaboration will be needed as to how to reconcile them\r\nwith the medium-term plan priorities.\r\nThere are thousands of unseen hands that provide\r\nthe backup support to our work. Their welfare is of\r\ncritical concern to us. The Secretary-General’s report\r\nhas proposed a number of measures to create a more\r\nversatile, competent and well-managed workforce. This\r\nis welcome.\r\nThe Secretary-General has requested clear\r\nguidance in the form of a resolution by this Assembly.\r\nWe owe him this. President Kavan has elaborated a\r\nprocedure whereby he aims to achieve this objective,\r\nthrough transparent consultations and the help of a few\r\nfacilitators under his stewardship. We endorse that\r\napproach. We commend his commitment. We have\r\nevery confidence that our combined endeavours will\r\nbring this task to fruition.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
