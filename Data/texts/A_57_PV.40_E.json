(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 52 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/387 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMr. Nikolov (the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia): I am making this statement on behalf of\r\nmy Permanent Representative, who is unable to present\r\nat this morning’s meeting.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration, the United\r\nNations provided the world with a vision for the new\r\ncentury. That vision was linked to measurable targets\r\nthat included precise and time-bound goals. In\r\naddition, the Secretary-General produced a road map\r\n(A/56/326) of the steps needed to reach the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nTogether with the definition of new development\r\ngoals, the reform of peace operations, the enhancing of\r\ncoherence and the building of new partnerships, the\r\nroad map is among the new features of the United\r\nNations, an Organization willing and able to deal with\r\nthe requirements and the challenges of the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nHowever, strengthening the United Nations\r\ncannot be completely achieved without two basic\r\npreconditions: creating an agenda focused on the\r\nessential issues of the globe and reforming the main\r\nUnited Nations bodies. We have succeeded in creating\r\nan appropriate agenda. The programme of work of the\r\nOrganization, as envisaged in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport to the General Assembly (A/57/387), including\r\nstrengthening human rights and enhancing public\r\ninformation, deserves our full support.\r\nThe United Nations has also made remarkable\r\nachievements in strengthening its capacity to fight\r\nterrorism and in two crucial areas — financing for\r\ndevelopment and sustainable development. On the\r\nother hand, if our agenda has an Achilles heel, then it\r\nmust be identified, along with the shortcomings of and\r\ndelays in reforming the main United Nations bodies.\r\nBy placing this issue as a very high priority on\r\nthe agenda of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly, Mr. President, you have not only met our\r\nexpectations, but have also provided an opportunity to\r\nregain momentum in reforming both the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council. In order for this\r\nprocess to be successful, full compliance by Member\r\nStates is necessary, as is the work of the Open-ended\r\nWorking Group on the reform of the Security Council\r\nand the work of the facilitators for the open-ended\r\nconsultations on the revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIt is imperative to recognize during deliberations\r\non strengthening the United Nations that this issue\r\ntranscends the national interests of each individual\r\nMember State. If we want the United Nations to be a\r\nmore meaningful, powerful and effective organization\r\nin the era of globalization, it must not be reduced to a\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nmere sum of national interests. That should be taken as\r\nthe point of departure of our intention to reform the\r\nUnited Nations system. We should be guided by the\r\nfact that a complete reform of the United Nations\r\ncannot be accomplished without the simultaneous\r\nenlargement of the Security Council, revitalization of\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and strengthening of the management and\r\nadministration of the United Nations.\r\nRegarding the overall goal, we should seek full\r\nemancipation of the United Nations as a multilateral\r\ninstitution, with a General Assembly that is not only\r\nrevitalized, but also capable of utilizing its full\r\ncapacity; with a Security Council that is truly\r\nrepresentative of the United Nations membership; and\r\nwith a streamlined Secretariat that is responsive to the\r\nneeds and interests of all Member States.\r\nIn short, what Raymond Aaron has defined as the\r\ngerm of a universal consciousness should become the\r\nmain ingredient in deepening the reform process of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAccording to the Charter, the organizational\r\narchitecture of the United Nations is based on three\r\npillars — the General Assembly, the Security Council\r\nand the Secretariat — whose equal importance must be\r\nemphasized. Contrary to that, however, the General\r\nAssembly is increasingly viewed as the weakest pillar\r\nof the three. Its main problem seems to stem from what\r\nmight be defined as inertia that cannot be ended,\r\ndespite the fact that, since the forty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, many resolutions on revitalization\r\nhave been adopted.\r\nThe signal is more than clear. In order to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly, we must find ways\r\nand means of reshaping and restructuring its agenda,\r\nworking methods and procedural matters. The General\r\nAssembly must not exercise its function as a seasonal\r\nbody. The General Assembly, together with its working\r\nbodies, such as the presidency, the Bureau and others,\r\nhas to play an active role in designing, disseminating\r\nand implementing United Nations policies on the\r\nglobal issues which should be at the core of its\r\nactivities. The recent measures aimed at improving\r\nsome of the Assembly’s working methods should be\r\nconsidered as a first step in the right direction.\r\nIn the Millennium Declaration Member States\r\nhave already made a strong commitment to reform the\r\nUnited Nations system, reaffirming the central position\r\nof the General Assembly as the chief deliberative,\r\npolicy-making and representative organ of the United\r\nNations. One can hardly imagine how that role can be\r\nsafeguarded without far-reaching reform of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nUndoubtedly, the relationship between the\r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly is a key\r\nissue of the ongoing reform debate. Close cooperation\r\nand coordination between the two bodies appears\r\nnecessary, particularly in discussing issues of vital\r\nimportance to the Organization as a whole. If we agree\r\nwith the assessment made by our colleague\r\nAmbassador Mahbubani of Singapore, that an essential\r\nsymbiotic relationship between the Security Council\r\nand the General Assembly exists, then we must accept\r\nthe need to restructure the General Assembly, rather\r\nthan revitalizing it. That is the only way to preserve the\r\nbalance between a reformed Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nDuring the recent debate on the report of the\r\nSecurity Council, several delegations made a clear\r\ncommitment to ensuring that reform is comprehensive,\r\nand that it includes expansion of Council membership\r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories\r\nand improvement of the Council’s working methods\r\nand decision-making process, and that it imparts\r\nbalance, accurate representation and legitimacy to the\r\nCouncil, thus reflecting contemporary reality.\r\nAt the same time, we agree with warnings against\r\nmakeshift solutions, such as the one made by\r\nAmbassador Schumacher of Germany. In our opinion,\r\nthe most effective way to avoid them is through a\r\nphased reform process. We should not forget that we\r\nare ultimately responsible for the pace and scope of the\r\nreform process.\r\nIt is for Member States to decide the dosage of\r\npolitical will required to reach a successful outcome in\r\nthe work of the Open-ended Working Group on\r\nCouncil reform. On the other hand, we must be aware\r\nof the fact that the authority of the Organization as a\r\nwhole, and the credibility and legitimacy of the\r\nSecurity Council are at stake. To promote global\r\ngovernance, as one of our colleagues, Ambassador\r\nVento of Italy, rightly pointed out in the\r\naforementioned debate, the Security Council needs true\r\nleadership based on a collective vision and shared\r\ninterests and values.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nMany people, among them the people of the\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, share a vision of a world that\r\nmust move from interdependence to being an\r\nintegrated global community with a shared future,\r\nshared responsibilities, shared prosperity and, above\r\nall, shared values. Can we imagine such a paradigm of\r\nprogress without an organization like the United\r\nNations? I cannot. But nor can it be imagined that the\r\nUnited Nations can serve those purposes without\r\nprofound reform of its main bodies fully corresponding\r\nto such a vision.\r\nQuite often, during our discussions on\r\nstrengthening the United Nations, reference is made to\r\nthe utmost necessity for the Organization to be both\r\neffective and efficient. Within that context, allow me to\r\nquote a former colleague, Ambassador Perkins: “Being\r\neffective means doing the right thing. Being efficient\r\nmeans doing the thing right”. Let those words of\r\nwisdom guide us while we carry forward the noble\r\nendeavour of the work of the reform of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Stańczyk (Poland): I would like to voice my\r\ncountry’s appreciation for the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts in the further expansion of the scope of reforms\r\nand modernization of the United Nations. The reform\r\nmeasures presented in the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(S/2002/387) are a necessary and valuable contribution\r\nto the implementation of the noble objectives of the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nThe reform and adaptation of the United Nations\r\nto meet present requirements and needs can and should\r\nbe pursued at different levels. The Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Republic of Poland, Mr. Wladzimierz\r\nCimoszewicz, during the general debate at this very\r\nsession called for the elaboration of a document that\r\ncould be considered as a new act of the United Nations\r\nat the dawn of the twenty-first century, which could\r\ngive fresh impetus to the principles, organs and\r\nmechanisms of the United Nations and make them\r\nmore responsive to the challenges dominating the life\r\nof the international community today (see A/57/PV.8,\r\np. 20).\r\nFour groups of fundamental problems have been\r\nidentified, and an appropriate mechanism, initially in\r\nthe form of a group of eminent persons, has been\r\nsuggested. We want to consult on these ideas with the\r\nUnited Nations membership at large. We duly note that\r\nthe reform proposals put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral focus on a cluster of managerial and efficiency\r\nmeasures, within his own area of responsibility and\r\ncompetence, aimed at ensuring better service for\r\nMember States. Consequently, the key political domain\r\nof United Nations reform falls within the purview of\r\nMember States and, as such, requires their concerted\r\nefforts.\r\nMr. President, let me express our thanks for your\r\ntimely initiative of convening the informal\r\nconsultations held on 24 October which, before the\r\npresent debate, allowed for an exchange of views and a\r\ndialogue on the reform proposals between Member\r\nStates and the Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Louise\r\nFréchette.\r\nPoland is following this debate with the utmost\r\ninterest and shares a great number of the opinions\r\nexpressed during its course. In particular, we align\r\nourselves with the statement of Ambassador Løj of\r\nDenmark, who spoke on behalf of the European Union\r\nand associated countries.\r\nAt this stage of the debate, I would like to share\r\nwith other Member States some general observations\r\nand a few comments on issues presented in the\r\ndocument A/57/387 that are perceived by my\r\nGovernment to be the important ones. We begin with\r\nthe Secretary-General’s oft-repeated premise that\r\nUnited Nations reform is not an event but a process.\r\nWe hope that this new initiative will add momentum to\r\nUnited Nations reform, building on the achievements\r\nand lessons learned so far, and that it will focus on\r\nwell-defined objectives and achievable and measurable\r\nexpected accomplishments.\r\nTo attain this, it is necessary to promote and\r\nstrengthen mutual trust, cooperation and consultations\r\nbetween Member States and the Secretariat. This is a\r\nconditio sine qua non since reform and its success are a\r\nresponsibility shared by both Member States and the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nIn the view of my delegation, the strength of the\r\nreport on reform lies in its focus on a select group of\r\nissues and in its avoidance of the natural temptation to\r\ncover everything, spreading the reform exercise over\r\ntoo many issues at one time. The reform document sets\r\nout the goals and objectives to be achieved. We\r\nwelcome proposal of specific dates in a number of\r\nactions as a right step towards raising the level of\r\nspecificity of the reform process.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nOur analysis of the document on an agenda for\r\nfurther change leads us to conclude that it fairly\r\nreflects the current state of affairs and provides a\r\nconvincing diagnosis of existing shortcomings. Up to\r\nthis point, most if not all Member States and the\r\nSecretariat can agree. When it comes to the proposed\r\nactions aimed at the implementation of those\r\nobjectives, Poland, while wholeheartedly supporting\r\nmost of them, would like to suggest their eventual\r\nexpansion. In some other cases, we would like to seek\r\nfurther clarifications to dispel our doubts.\r\nWe agree with the thrust of action 1, in which the\r\nSecretary-General announces that his next proposed\r\nprogramme budget, for 2004-2005, will better reflect\r\nthe priorities agreed at the Millennium Assembly. At\r\nthis stage, this is a declaration of intent which\r\ncorresponds to and is linked with a number of other\r\nactions for the streamlining of the planning and\r\nbudgeting process, improvements required by results-\r\nbased budgeting and the expansion of the very concept\r\nof peacekeeping operations. This set of actions, which,\r\ntaken together, reflect the concept of results-based\r\nmanagement, obviously requires a closer, technical\r\nreview at the expert level.\r\nThe Secretary-General also proposes to renew his\r\nearlier concept of sunset provisions, which in previous\r\nyears was met with reservations. At this juncture, we\r\nwould like to indicate that it could be useful to review\r\nalso how new emerging needs and new additional\r\nprogrammes and activities could best be\r\naccommodated through streamlined planning and\r\nbudgetary processes. One way to handle this issue is to\r\nidentify existing projects and activities which are not\r\nof immediate importance, whose impact is less crucial\r\nand which could be postponed or implemented by other\r\ninternational organizations, scientific and training\r\ninstitutions or civil society. Now more than in the past,\r\nthe results-based technique, which focuses on impact\r\nand attaining measurable achievements, allows the\r\nidentification of those activities. Resources thus freed\r\nup could then be redirected to new high-priority areas.\r\nThe General Assembly might revisit a number of its\r\npast consensus resolutions, calling for the identification\r\nof obsolete, marginally useful or ineffective activities.\r\nThe title of these resolutions was not very diplomatic.\r\nIt sounded somehow negative, or even offensive, and it\r\ncould be changed. But the idea behind that process is\r\nsound and could be better applied to present-day\r\nrequirements.\r\nAs an example of the actions that enjoy our full\r\nsupport, let me cite action 5, aimed at strengthening the\r\nmanagement capacity of the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights. This is\r\nan area of United Nations activities in which my\r\ncountry has accumulated some experience over recent\r\nyears, most recently from the perspective of the\r\nchairmanship of the Commission on Human Rights. We\r\nare looking forward to the conclusions and specific\r\naction-oriented recommendations of the management\r\nreview requested by the General Assembly, which is\r\nbeing completed by the Office of Internal Oversight\r\nServices.\r\nRepresentative of the group of measures on which\r\nPoland has some doubts and reservations is action 8,\r\nwhich contemplates consolidation of United Nations\r\ninformation centres into regional hubs, starting with\r\nWestern Europe. The argument in favour of that\r\nmeasure, which means the closure of some information\r\ncentres, is rationalization and cost-cutting. Poland’s\r\nexperience with United Nations information centres\r\ndemonstrates that they are a powerful tool at the\r\nOrganization’s disposal and that they play a key role in\r\nthe function of outreach, liaison with civil society and\r\nadvocacy of United Nations activities for the general\r\npublic. Those objectives are a vital part of the new\r\nstructure of the Department of Public Information,\r\nwhich is outlined in action 6. Hasty decisions to close\r\nwell-functioning centres in the name of rationalization\r\nand expected savings — which first have to be\r\nidentified as meaningful — could bring more harm\r\nthan good. Accordingly, we would like to suggest a\r\ncautious approach. If the Secretary-General decides to\r\ngo ahead with his intention to create a Western\r\nEuropean hub, we recommend that it be a limited pilot\r\nproject only. In due time, the results and impact of that\r\nproject should be properly evaluated and\r\ncommunicated to Member States before further action\r\nis taken on the matter.\r\nThe exhaustive debate of yesterday and today\r\nbrings us closer to an understanding and appreciation\r\nof the stage of reform now before us. A number of\r\nproposed actions are of a highly technical nature and\r\nrequire more detailed debate among experts. Issues\r\nsuch as reforming the planning and budgeting\r\nprocesses, human resources management and\r\nconference management would best be discussed in the\r\nFifth Committee of the General Assembly. Similarly,\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nother issues could usefully be reviewed by the other\r\nMain Committees of the General Assembly.\r\nIf past practice is a guide, the General Assembly\r\nmight at a certain moment decide on the need to create\r\na dedicated mechanism — a working group to develop\r\nfurther and agree on the details of reform measures.\r\nMy delegation declares its readiness to participate in\r\nsuch endeavours to the best of our abilities.\r\nMr. Sychov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Please\r\nallow me, first of all, to express our sincere gratitude to\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the report\r\nhe has prepared. Our delegation notes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s intention to further improve the Organization\r\nand to adapt it to modern requirements of Member\r\nStates and to new challenges of our era.\r\nComprehensive reform of the United Nations remains\r\none of the components of the process of the\r\ndevelopment of the United Nations system. The\r\nOrganization will not be able to move ahead in solving\r\nthe most acute problems of this century without having\r\na common recognition of the rules and structures\r\nwhose activities should become more consistent,\r\npredictable and, above all, efficient.\r\nThe main task today is to determine the most\r\nimportant areas where the work of the United Nations\r\ncan be improved in order to strengthen as much as\r\npossible the Organization’s potential for implementing\r\nthe guidelines contained in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, as well as in the final documents of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe recent adoption of these programme\r\ndocuments mentioned above has undoubtedly\r\npredetermined the need for a careful analysis and\r\nevaluation of all the Organization’s activities, including\r\nthe redistribution of financial resources.\r\nIn this connection, we are looking forward to the\r\nsubmission next year by the Secretary-General for the\r\nconsideration of the General Assembly of a revised\r\ndraft program budget for the biennium 2004-2005, to\r\npermit this document to reflect the priorities stipulated\r\nby the above mentioned international conferences. On\r\nthe basis of a revised draft programme budget and by\r\nimplementing the Millennium Declaration, along with\r\nthe decisions adopted at Monterrey and Johannesburg,\r\nwe hope to further the principles of integrity and\r\nuniversality.\r\nThe delegation of Belarus believes that equal\r\nattention should be given to all the goals formulated in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, many of which have been\r\nfurther specified in the decisions adopted in Monterrey\r\nand Johannesburg.\r\nThe above-mentioned goals, as is known, cover a\r\nwide range of tasks in such areas as overcoming social\r\nand economic backwardness and the eradication of the\r\npoverty, the protection and encouragement of all\r\nhuman rights, including the right to development,\r\nmeasures in the area of international security and\r\ndisarmament, and environmental protection.\r\nWe note with interest the intention of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights to\r\ndevelop and implement, in cooperation with the United\r\nNations Development Group and the Executive\r\nCommittee on Humanitarian Affairs, a plan to\r\nstrengthen human rights-related United Nations actions\r\nat the country level.\r\nWe expect that the General Assembly will show\r\ngreat interest and give comprehensive consideration to\r\nthis important document.\r\nWe also hope that subsequent measures to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations system will be adopted,\r\ntaking into account the interests of all States at\r\ndiffering stages of social and economic development.\r\nThe United Nations needs to facilitate the\r\nestablishment of stable and irreversible trends in the\r\nsocial and economic development of all States,\r\nincluding through their effective integration into the\r\nworld economy. Otherwise, we will continue to face\r\nsituations where, for example, because of large-scale\r\nfinancial crises, dynamically developing economies of\r\nindividual States are relegated to the status of\r\nrecipients of international assistance for development.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus supports the proposals\r\nby the Secretary-General with regard to further\r\nimproving United Nations activities in the field of\r\npublic information. We anticipate that, as a result of the\r\nproposed restructuring, the personnel of the\r\nDepartment of Public Information (DPI) will be able to\r\nimprove the scope of information products that are\r\nprepared, taking into account the specificity of\r\ndifferent regions and the need to provide information\r\nregarding United Nations activities that is of direct\r\ninterest to a particular public. The experience of\r\nBelarus’ cooperation with the United Nations Radio in\r\nthe dissemination of information for the attention of\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nthe Belarus public indicates that materials prepared\r\nwith due account taken of the domestic interests are the\r\nmost effective ones.\r\nWe are confident that in the preparation of the\r\nProgramme Budget for the biennium 2004-2005 we\r\nshould envisage the allocation of sufficient resources to\r\nensure the use of advanced information technologies in\r\nDPI activities and work to provide information services\r\nto Member States.\r\nThe need for structural reforms within the United\r\nNations should not overshadow measures intended to\r\nrationalize the organizational aspects of the United\r\nNations activities. In this regard, the proposed\r\nmeasures for further improvement and rationalization\r\nof the preparation and submission of reports deserve\r\nspecial attention.\r\nWe generally share the approach to reduce the\r\nnumber of reports and improve their quality. Belarus\r\nsupports the aspiration of the Secretary-General to\r\nmake reports more analytical, informative and more\r\nfocused on proposed and recommended measures. At\r\nthe same time, we consider it important in preparing\r\nthe reports to adhere to the principle of considering\r\nevery situation on a case-by-case basis, with due\r\naccount of the opinion of countries in whose interest\r\nthe report has been requested.\r\nUnited Nations reform is unattainable without\r\nchanging the system of planning and the preparation of\r\nbudgets, which requires serious analysis and review in\r\norder to reallocate the resources in accordance with the\r\napproved priorities of the Organization.\r\nWe cannot help expressing our satisfaction that in\r\nrecent years there has been some improvement in the\r\nUnited Nations financial situation. At the same time,\r\nwe should not forget that this is occurring against the\r\nbackground of an ever-increasing scope of United\r\nNations activities dictated by globalization and the new\r\nchallenges of the present day.\r\nWe cannot agree with what we see as a somewhat\r\noversimplified approach contained in the report as to\r\nthe consideration of the most complex issues of the\r\nbudgeting and planning processes.\r\nBelarus can agree with the proposal to transform\r\na mid-term plan into a plan covering only two years,\r\nincluding measures for simplifying its preparation.\r\nHowever, we are doubtful as to the need to authorize\r\nthe Secretary-General to reallocate resources between\r\nprogrammes and budget items up 10 per cent within a\r\nsingle budgetary period. I would like to recall that the\r\ndistribution and reallocation of resources between\r\nprogrammes is an extremely sensitive issue reflecting a\r\nbalance of interests of major groups of countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm the\r\nreadiness of the Belarus delegation for constructive\r\ncooperation in the consideration of the proposals\r\npresented by the Secretary-General, on the basis of our\r\ncommon interest, confirmed in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, to reform the United Nations with a view\r\nto transforming it into a truly universal and\r\ninstitutionally strong organization capable of\r\naddressing the complex issues dictated by our times.\r\nMr. Jalango (Kenya): At the outset, let me\r\nconvey my delegation’s appreciation for the manner in\r\nwhich the Assembly President is steering our\r\ndeliberations on this important subject. My delegation\r\nwelcomes the report of the Secretary-General entitled,\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change”. The report is timely, comprehensive\r\nand provides useful guidelines for spearheading the\r\nreforms that would ensure the strengthening of our\r\nOrganization. We appreciate the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral incorporated into his report areas that various\r\ndelegations had identified as priorities and in need of\r\nfurther clarification.\r\nMy delegation associates itself fully with the\r\nstatement made earlier by Egypt on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group, as well as with the non-paper that has\r\nbeen circulated outlining the concerns of African\r\nStates. My delegation also associates itself with the\r\nstatement made earlier by Venezuela on behalf of the\r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nWe acknowledge that the priorities for the new\r\ncentury, as outlined in the report, are those identified\r\nby the Millennium Declaration (A/RES/55/2), namely,\r\nthe fight for development for all the peoples of the\r\nworld; the fight against poverty, ignorance and disease;\r\nthe fight against injustice; the fight against violence,\r\nterror and crime; and the fight against the degradation\r\nand destruction of our common home. My delegation is\r\nof the opinion, however, that, in order for those\r\npriorities to be truly comprehensive, they should\r\ncomplement the outcomes of other conferences, such as\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nIt is the conviction of my delegation that the\r\npolitical and socio-economic scenario prevailing in the\r\nworld today, in this era of globalization, needs a strong\r\nand effective multilateral institution. We therefore add\r\nour voice to those who have called for the need to\r\nreaffirm and strengthen the core responsibility of the\r\nUnited Nations capability for collective action. Indeed,\r\nthat is the guiding principle that led our leaders to\r\nadopt the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), as well as to transform the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity into the African Union. We realized that\r\nour economies and political structures cannot compete\r\nindividually in the international arena.\r\nWe note with concern the continued inadequate\r\nfunding from the United Nations regular budget for\r\nboth the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP) and the United Nations Human Settlements\r\nProgramme (UN-Habitat). In that regard, Kenya calls\r\nfor the strengthening of UNEP and UN-Habitat through\r\nthe provision of adequate and predictable funding to\r\nenable them carry out their mandates in an effective\r\nand timely manner.\r\nMy delegation calls for further measures aimed at\r\nstrengthening coordination between Headquarters and\r\nregional offices. That, we believe, will eliminate\r\noverlapping and duplication of efforts and will ensure\r\ncost-effectiveness. We support the proposal of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Group to develop an\r\nimplementation plan to strengthen the United Nations\r\npresence in developing countries. However, in order\r\nfor that to be effective, it must be accompanied by the\r\nprovision of adequate resources in terms of both\r\npersonnel and financing at all levels.\r\nMy delegation wishes to seek further clarification\r\non the mandate of the Office of the Special Adviser on\r\nAfrica, especially its role with regard to the follow-up\r\nof NEPAD. Kenya fully supports the view of the\r\nAfrican Group that such an Office should be permanent\r\nwithin the United Nations system in order to address\r\nAfrican interests on a continuous and permanent basis.\r\nWith regard to General Assembly reforms, Kenya\r\nfully endorses the achievements attained thus far and\r\nwelcomes the amendment of rule 30 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, which has resulted in a smooth transition\r\nfrom the fifty-sixth to the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly following the early election of the\r\nPresident and the Vice-Presidents. We call for that\r\nmove to be institutionalized.\r\nKenya believes that the General Assembly should\r\nassume its role as the principal organ of the United\r\nNations and calls for the streamlining of work and the\r\ninteraction between the General Assembly and other\r\norgans, principally the Security Council and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. My delegation fully\r\nsupports the proposal that items and resolutions should\r\nbe reviewed with a view to reducing their number. We\r\nwelcome the proposal for the biennialization of items\r\nand for the clustering of items dealing with common\r\nissues as a means of ensuring economy of time and\r\nexpenses. We urge that caution be exercised so as to\r\nensure that significant issues — particularly those\r\npertaining to developing countries — are not denied\r\nthe adequate attention that they deserve.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative, outlined in his report, with regard to\r\nsupporting human rights at the country level by\r\nrationalizing and streamlining the work of the human\r\nrights treaty bodies, improving working methods and\r\nprocedures and streamlining management. That will\r\nassist in the improvement of the financial situation of\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights. But Kenya would like to see\r\nelections to the membership of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights conducted, consistent with established\r\npractice, on a regional basis. My delegation notes the\r\nSecretary-General’s ideas contained in paragraph 46 of\r\nthe report and seeks further clarification, since we are\r\nof the view that the holding of common positions is a\r\nnormal practice within the Commission on Human\r\nRights.\r\nKenya reiterates its belief that Member States\r\nshould be consulted with regard to any plans aimed\r\nat expanding the mandates of the Resident\r\nRepresentatives and that all operational activities of the\r\nUnited Nations should conform to the principles of\r\nneutrality and multilateralism. In addition, it is Kenya’s\r\nresolute conviction that States parties to various\r\nconventions should be consulted on measures taken to\r\nstreamline reporting procedures and obligations.\r\nAlthough there is merit in single reporting, the\r\npracticability of that proposal should be elaborated\r\nfurther in consultation with Member States, taking into\r\naccount the mandates establishing the special\r\nprocedures.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the important role\r\nplayed by the United Nations in the fight against the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. As the Assembly is aware, the\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nAfrican continent has been critically affected by that\r\npandemic, which has reversed our development gains\r\nof the past three decades and has increased poverty\r\nlevels. Kenya has established a National AIDS Control\r\nCouncil, and we are gratified to note that levels of\r\nprevalence have shown a marked decrease since the\r\ninception of advocacy programmes. We are confident\r\nthat the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria will contribute immensely to our endeavours to\r\neradicate this scourge.\r\nAs a country that is actively involved in and\r\ncommitted to United Nations peacekeeping operations,\r\nKenya welcomes the implementation of the proposals\r\ncontained in the report of the Panel on United Nations\r\nPeace Operations (A/55/305), especially with regard to\r\nthe significant improvements made in the\r\nOrganization’s capacity to deploy and manage complex\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building operations.\r\nMy delegation supports the efforts aimed at\r\nimproving United Nations public information activities\r\nand at enhancing the effectiveness of the Department of\r\nPublic Information (DPI). In that regard, we welcome\r\nthe recommendations contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report with regard to the restructuring of\r\nDPI, particularly the possibility of establishing regional\r\ninformation links.\r\nKenya supports the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral aimed at improving the Organization’s\r\neffectiveness as well as at streamlining the budgetary\r\nand administrative procedures of the United Nations. It\r\nis in that positive spirit of support that my delegation\r\nwishes to submit its comments and views on the report\r\nas follows.\r\nWith regard to the intention of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit a thoroughly revised programme\r\nbudget to the General Assembly in 2003, my\r\ndelegation underscores the need to ensure that the\r\nrevised programme budget reflects the priorities\r\ncontained in the medium-term plan and other\r\nlegislative mandates.\r\nKenya welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals on managing conferences and meetings. In\r\nthat regard, I have asked the Secretary-General to\r\nensure that there is enhanced and sustained utilization\r\nof conference facilities and services in other United\r\nNations duty stations, particularly at the United\r\nNations Office at Nairobi. My delegation appreciates\r\nthe measures undertaken by the Secretary-General to\r\nimprove and strengthen the capacity and utilization of\r\nconference facilities and services at Nairobi, which\r\nhave, so far, yielded positive results.\r\nThis confirms the viability of the United Nations\r\nOffice at Nairobi as an important venue and a global\r\ncentre for international conferences and programmes\r\nfor the United Nations, as well as for other\r\ngovernmental bodies. My delegation therefore calls\r\nupon the Secretary-General to take pragmatic steps to\r\nexpand and modernize the United Nations conference\r\nfacilities at that duty station in view of the challenges\r\nto further growth in utilization posed by the inadequacy\r\nof necessary resources and capacity requirements.\r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals on enhancing staff mobility across the United\r\nNations system. In that regard, we wish to draw the\r\nattention of the Secretary-General to the fact that the\r\nArabic and English interpretation booths have\r\nremained vacant ever since a permanent Interpretation\r\nService was established at the United Nations Office at\r\nNairobi in 2000.\r\nKenya fully supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to review the current system of internal\r\njustice, to improve the efficiency of the system and to\r\nallow staff to have fair and just processing of their\r\ncomplaints. We call upon the newly appointed\r\nOmbudsman to resolve some long- pending cases of\r\ninjustice done to employees or former employees of the\r\nUnited Nations from developing countries, including\r\nsome of my nationals. We note with concern, however,\r\nthat some of these cases have been outstanding for\r\nclose to more than 10 years.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming my delegation’s\r\ncommitment to United Nations reform and to the\r\nsubsequent strengthening of the Organization. We hope\r\nthat the issues we have raised so far for further\r\nclarification will be given due consideration.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to extend our sincere thanks to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for introducing his\r\nimportant report (A/57/387). We commend him for his\r\ninitiatives to reform the work of the Organization in\r\nvarious spheres, in order to improve its efficiency and\r\nto make it a capable Organization, responsive to the\r\nnumerous challenges confronting the world today.\r\nMy delegation also supports the statement made\r\nby Ambassador Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the Permanent\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nRepresentative of the Arab Republic of Egypt to the\r\nUnited Nations, on behalf of the African Group under\r\nagenda item 53, entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations system”.\r\nWhen considering the reform process, one must\r\nacknowledge that reform efforts, by their very nature,\r\nrequire perseverance and careful insight. It is a long,\r\nmulti-phase process in which one cannot skip one\r\nphase and move to the next. The path to reform\r\nconsists of a series of harmonious, consecutive and\r\nregular steps towards the desired objectives.\r\nMy delegation, in principle, affirms its support\r\nfor all reform efforts. We look forward to a\r\ncomprehensive approach to reform that would make it\r\npossible to achieve reform of the major organs of the\r\nUnited Nations system, such as the General Assembly,\r\nthe Security Council, the Economic and Social Council\r\nand others. Such an approach must also reflect the\r\nclose links among those organs.\r\nThe report before us, entitled “Strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations: an agenda for further change”, has\r\ngiven rise to numerous questions, ideas and concepts; it\r\nhas energized groups and enriched our debate. It has\r\nthus laid down a good foundation on which we can\r\nbuild until we complete the structure we seek.\r\nThe legitimate question of the priorities\r\ngoverning the work, activities and programmes of the\r\nOrganization is among those that need definite and\r\ncategorical answers. At the Millennium Summit, heads\r\nof State or Government set the strategic priorities that\r\ngovern our direction and light the way to the future of\r\nhumankind. Does the report of the Secretary-General in\r\nits present form define new priorities, other than those\r\nthat were agreed upon? And what has become of the\r\nother priorities that have not been included in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report?\r\nMy delegation believes that the report fails to\r\nmention many important topics that we had hoped\r\nwould be discussed, in view of their obvious\r\nimportance, such as those relating to the Security\r\nCouncil and legal questions.\r\nWe highly appreciate the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has accorded special importance to the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration by\r\nmentioning it in action 1. It is important to recall the\r\nresults of the major conferences that have been\r\nconvened by the United Nations system over the past\r\ntwo years. Among these conferences, we cite the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries, the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, among others, which have added new\r\ncommitments and specific objectives to the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. These must all be taken into consideration\r\nwhen debating this question. My country appreciates\r\nthe contribution made by the United Nations and its\r\nagencies towards achieving sustainable development in\r\ndeveloping countries. This prompts us to welcome the\r\nview reflected in the Secretary-General’s action 14,\r\nregarding strengthening the work of the United Nations\r\nat the country level. In order to ensure the\r\nOrganization’s success in discharging its mandate, it\r\nmust address the shortage of human resources in its\r\ncountry offices and mobilize the capacities of those\r\noffices so that they can carry out their responsibilities.\r\nWe need hardly recall the negative effect of the\r\ndecrease in basic resources on operational activities\r\nand, hence, on the development programmes of\r\ndeveloping countries. Efforts must therefore be made to\r\ntackle that phenomenon by providing new, additional,\r\nstable and predictable resources.\r\nThe Sudan welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\ninitiative to support and promote human rights at the\r\nnational level. The Sudan concurs with the African\r\nposition with regard to the following human rights\r\nissues referred to in the Secretary-General’s report.\r\nFirst, the universality and coherence of human rights\r\nmust be respected on a non-selective basis. Secondly,\r\nwe must strictly abide by the rules that apply with\r\nregard to candidature for membership in the\r\nCommission on Human Rights, in accordance with the\r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution.\r\nThirdly, the views of Member States must be sought\r\nwith regard to any proposals to broaden the mandate of\r\nthe Resident Coordinator. Operational activities must\r\nalso be consistent with the principles of impartiality,\r\nuniversality and multilateralism.\r\nFourthly, while we welcome the reference in the\r\nreport to the formulation of guidelines to improve the\r\nfunctioning of the special procedures, we stress the\r\nneed to debate such proposals with Member States,\r\nbearing in mind that they must accord with the mandate\r\ngranted to the special procedures relevant to human\r\nrights.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nAs to parts of the report relating to information,\r\nwe strongly support the central role played by public\r\ninformation in the work of this Organization and\r\nbelieve that it must be accorded priority in any reform\r\neffort. In this context, we believe that an operational\r\nprogramme of action should be prepared, with a budget\r\nto be submitted to the General Assembly at its next\r\nsession. The preparation of the final programme should\r\nbe preceded by a series of workshops and by\r\nspecialized studies undertaken by experts from within\r\nand outside the Organization, while strongly\r\nemphasizing the need to redeploy resources with a\r\nview to making the optimum investment in the services\r\nof documentation and periodic and daily publications.\r\nMy delegation supports efforts to improve the\r\nefficiency of the United Nations and the flow of work\r\nwith regard to its administrative and budgetary aspects.\r\nWe hope that the revised programme budget for the\r\nbiennium 2004-2005, which the Secretary-General\r\nplans to submit to the General Assembly in 2003, will\r\nreflect the priorities of the mid-term plan called for at\r\nthe Millennium Summit. In this regard, we welcome\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposals for the management\r\nof conferences and meetings, as long as they do not\r\naffect discussions by the specialized committees\r\nrelating to improvements in the performance of the\r\nDepartment for General Assembly and Conference\r\nManagement.\r\nMy delegation views with great interest the\r\nSecretary-General’s request that he be granted further\r\nflexibility and powers for redeploying resources among\r\nprogrammes. In this regard, we look forward to the\r\nestablishment of the necessary mechanism for\r\naccountability and control with the aim of studying that\r\nrequest in all its aspects so as to consider the positive\r\nand negative impact that it might have on the mandated\r\nprogrammes and activities. Any mandate of authority\r\nmust be viewed in the light of the provisions and rules\r\nof the Charter so as to allow us to get a clear picture of\r\nthe mandate and the consequent responsibility and\r\naccountability.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to review the current internal justice system\r\nof the Organization. We believe that such a step will\r\ncontribute greatly to improving efficiency and to\r\ncreating a climate of justice, integrity and transparency\r\nwithin the Organization.\r\nMr. Staehelin (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I\r\nshould like first of all to thank and congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General and his team for the report before us\r\ntoday. I would also like to express our gratitude to you,\r\nMr. President, and to the Deputy Secretary-General,\r\nLouise Fréchette, for having presented the report to the\r\npermanent representatives. The document deals with\r\nlongstanding problems relating to the quality and\r\nefficiency of the management of programmes, and it\r\ntakes up several major points that Switzerland has long\r\nheld dear. My country appreciates this initiative.\r\nAs the Secretary-General said when he introduced\r\nthe reform programme, the United Nations must re-\r\nexamine its activities so as to ensure that it focuses on\r\nits priorities and does not waste time or money. The\r\ncentral position as set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration provides an important common thread that\r\nruns through all of our efforts to strengthen the United\r\nNations. The United Nations and other inter-\r\ngovernmental bodies can thus rally behind common\r\ngoals. The Millennium Declaration maps out the road\r\nto be followed in restructuring the Organization and\r\nengaging in effective partnerships. Analysing the\r\nactivities of the United Nations from this perspective\r\nwill enable the Organization to refocus its efforts and\r\nmake better use its limited human and financial\r\nresources.\r\nOther changes outlined in the report are designed\r\nto achieve the same end. These include the application\r\nof sunset provisions, better targeted publications,\r\nreports that are fewer in number but of greater use to\r\nMember States and meetings that are less frequent but\r\nmore productive. We understand that this report on the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations does not in any\r\nway prejudice the priorities of the Millennium road\r\nmap.\r\nThe statements and proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for more constructive action in the field of\r\nhuman rights are particularly welcome. They respond\r\nto our concern about further strengthening the tools\r\nused to protect and promote human rights. My country\r\nis ready to cooperate substantially in the consideration\r\ngiven to this subject. Switzerland shares the concern of\r\nthe Secretary-General about the dangers of a\r\nCommission on Human Rights that is increasingly\r\npolarized. As an observer in that body, my country\r\nalways promoted dialogue rather than confrontation,\r\nand we intend to continue our commitment to\r\nconstructive and open dialogue. Switzerland views\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nfavourably the suggestion that we streamline the\r\ncurrent system of reporting to the treaty control bodies.\r\nThe reporting system must be simplified and made\r\nmore transparent for States, committees and civil\r\nsociety. A single country report would convey a\r\nclearer, more realistic and efficient picture of the\r\nimplementation of human rights conventions.\r\nFinally, the regular United Nations budget must\r\nhave sufficient funds to cover the costs incurred by the\r\ntreaty-control bodies and the special procedures of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights. We also await with\r\ngreat interest the plan of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights for improving\r\nmanagement methods, in particular in the field of\r\nhuman resources.\r\nImproving public information is an important\r\naspect of reform. We are concerned by the fact that\r\nUnited Nations Information Centres in developed\r\ncountries, where costs are very high, take up 40 per\r\ncent of available resources and we welcome, therefore,\r\nthe proposal to restructure the network of United\r\nNations Information Centres around regional hubs. We\r\nnote with satisfaction the explanations of the\r\nSecretariat that this restructuring of the information\r\nnetwork and of conference services will not weaken the\r\ncapacities in that field of the United Nations Offices at\r\nGeneva (UNOG) and Vienna.\r\nMoreover, we are convinced that the United\r\nNations Office at Geneva will be able to play a key role\r\nin the future with respect to the European United\r\nNations information hub, not only because the\r\nnecessary infrastructure and know-how are already in\r\nplace, but also, thanks to its long tradition of\r\nmultilingualism and the presence of numerous United\r\nNations specialized agencies and other international\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations.\r\nAs for the coordination of United Nations\r\nlibraries, we understand the logic of integrated\r\nmanagement and the need for modernization. We feel\r\nhowever that there could be cause for concern if the\r\nproposed measures were to lead to a larger\r\nbureaucracy, the creation of new high-level posts or to\r\na transfer of the general management of the United\r\nNations library in Geneva from the Director General of\r\nUNOG to the Department of Public Information in\r\nNew York.\r\nWe are further convinced that good management\r\nof the archives of the League of Nations, an\r\norganization without historic ties to New York, is an\r\nargument for keeping the responsibility for these\r\narchives in Geneva.\r\nAnother important priority of the United Nations\r\nis development cooperation, and we greatly appreciate\r\nthe various proposals made to improve the operational\r\nactivities of the United Nations system in the field of\r\ndevelopment. The formulas proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral are the logical consequence of discussions\r\nwithin the framework of the Triennial Comprehensive\r\nPolicy Review. My country would be happy if more\r\nconsideration were given to the forms which the\r\npresence of the United Nations might assume at the\r\ncountry level. We invite the Secretary-General to\r\nprepare a report on the matter and make\r\nrecommendations without losing sight of the absolute\r\nneed to maintain the universal character of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn the same vein, another area which could\r\nbenefit from better management of resources is\r\nenvironmental protection, a subject which is also high\r\non the list of Swiss foreign policy priorities. As was\r\nrecently stressed in the decision of the Governing\r\nCouncil of the United Nations Environment Program\r\n(UNEP), financial support of the United Nations for\r\nUNEP should be increased to provide the necessary\r\nresources to guarantee the continuation of its role as a\r\ncentral pillar in the international environmental system.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations budget, we are\r\nof the opinion that the planning and budgetary process\r\nis still unnecessarily complex and involves a large\r\nnumber of staff. It must undergo thorough reform in\r\norder to become more efficient. We would like to see a\r\nshorter, more strategic budget reflecting the priorities\r\nand working programme of the Organization. Similar\r\nreforms have been carried out successfully in several\r\nlarge United Nations specialized agencies, such as the\r\nInternational Labour Organization and the World\r\nHealth Organization.\r\nAs a new Member State of the United Nations,\r\nSwitzerland is particularly concerned with the\r\nbudgetary process of peacekeeping operations. The\r\nmoney allocated for the multiplicity of different\r\nbudgets is more than double the regular budget. What\r\nis more, these budgets are extremely difficult to\r\nmanage within national accounting systems. That is\r\nwhy we fully support the consolidation of mission\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nbudgets, if only to improve the quality of budget\r\nestimates in this field.\r\nFinally, Switzerland agrees with the need to\r\nreform the intergovernmental organizations. The\r\nEconomic and Social Council must be strengthened to\r\nbe in a position to carry out its orientation work\r\nconcerning important and complex aspects of\r\ndevelopment on a global scale. My country is ready to\r\nparticipate actively in realizing this goal. In particular\r\nit is important to realign the activities of the Economic\r\nand Social Council in its crucial mission of ensuring\r\nfollow-up for United Nations conferences, and of the\r\nMillennium Summit in particular.\r\nWe also share the opinion that any reform of the\r\nUnited Nations would not be complete without dealing\r\nwith the question of the composition and working\r\nmethods of the Security Council. The Council must\r\nreflect the world as it is today if it wishes to maintain\r\nits authority and credibility. For this reason, my\r\ncountry favours a limited enlargement of Council\r\nmembership to avoid weakening its ability to make\r\neffective decisions. The Security Council reform\r\nproject needs new political impetus.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like once again to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General for his\r\nreform proposals. We assure him of our wholehearted\r\nsupport in achieving its goals. In the meantime, we\r\nlook forward with great interest to the next biennium\r\nand to the presentation of a thoroughly revised\r\nprogramme budget reflecting the new priorities of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Hidayat (Indonesia): First of all, my\r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his important report,\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change.” I will make a number of general\r\ncomments, and then turn to some more specific ones.\r\nIndonesia has particular interest in the subject of\r\nreform of the United Nations. There is no doubt that\r\nevery report of this nature is a significant milestone in\r\nour efforts to transform the United Nations into the\r\nOrganization that was envisaged by its founders, as\r\nrecently confirmed by world leaders in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nIt is our view that the demands of multilateralism\r\ntoday commend the effective reform of the United\r\nNations to all its Members, as well as to everyone\r\ninterested in peace and human progress. Reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, as an intergovernmental organ, should\r\ncontinue to strengthen our ability and our capacity in\r\nthis direction.\r\nIn this connection, it is important to reflect on the\r\nfact that United Nations reform has been with us for\r\nsome years, and we think that is long enough for us to\r\nbegin to reflect critically on the process and on its\r\nbenefits. In his summary at the beginning of the report,\r\nthe Secretary-General describes the Organization as\r\n“evolving with the times”.\r\nIn order to ensure that this process continues,\r\ntowards making the United Nations “more efficient,\r\nmore open and more creative”, Indonesia would like to\r\nstress the need for Member States to remain conscious\r\nof the fact that reform of the United Nations should be\r\ntreated as reform of the entire Organization as a whole,\r\nand not reform of individual parts over time. Unless\r\nsuch a holistic and comprehensive approach is made —\r\na cardinal principle in the reform process — we run the\r\nrisk, at tremendous cost, of finding out down the road\r\nthat key areas of the Organization’s work have been\r\nleft behind. However, we must also be careful to note\r\nin this regard that it is not enough to continue to work\r\non the basis of proposals and intentions or to engage in\r\nreform for its own sake. In the past, there have been\r\nseveral proposals that have not brought real reform.\r\nThe delegation of Indonesia firmly believes that\r\nreforming the Organization to enable it to perform at\r\noptimum efficiency may well begin with the way that\r\nthe United Nations organizes its work. To that end, we\r\nsupport the proposals made by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report aimed at changing and harmonizing\r\nprocedures and processes within the Organization to\r\nmake improvement possible.\r\nHaving said that, I will now turn to specifics.\r\nIn the area of peace and security it is of the\r\nutmost importance that reform efforts are closely\r\ntargeted at eliminating areas of current multilateral\r\ncooperation that militate against progress. To put it\r\nanother way, we must continue to refine and modify\r\nour collective and individual behaviour, within the\r\ncontext of the United Nations, to enhance the structures\r\nand processes that contribute to peace and security.\r\nIn that connection, we concur with the\r\nobservation of the Secretary-General that no reform of\r\nthe United Nations would be complete without reform\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nof the Security Council. If the Council is to continue to\r\nenjoy worldwide credibility, which it critically needs\r\nfor its work, not only must its size, composition and\r\nworking methods be reviewed, but so must the capacity\r\nof the Council to act, to do so promptly, and to be seen\r\nto be employing the same standards on every agenda\r\nitem that comes before it. Indeed, the ability of the\r\nSecurity Council to reform itself comprehensively, as is\r\nbeing demanded by the generality of the membership,\r\nis crucial to its credibility.\r\nThe immediate and most obvious implication of\r\nthat is that the credibility of the Council carries over\r\ninto the willingness and readiness of Member States to\r\nimplement its resolutions and decisions or to make\r\nother contributions towards peace, especially in\r\nconflict situations. Even more important, as the most\r\nimportant multilateral body of the United Nations, the\r\nreform of the General Assembly must continue. Its\r\noverloaded agenda must be reordered and balanced by\r\naccommodating new and emerging issues so that the\r\nAssembly is stronger and more meaningful in facing\r\nnew challenges.\r\nIn that regard, it is imperative to strengthen the\r\nAssembly’s relationship vis-à-vis other main organs of\r\nthe United Nations, such as the Security Council and\r\nthe Economic and Social Council, so that the General\r\nAssembly will be able to give added value to the work\r\nof the Organization.\r\nIt is now a truism that peace and development are\r\nrelated. It is not possible to have one without the other.\r\nGiven that international peace and security are the first\r\nconcerns of the United Nations, our commitment to\r\nreform is our commitment to development and,\r\ntherefore, to peace. All our intergovernmental\r\nprocesses, which are anchored in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Millennium Declaration, must\r\nemphasize the developmental imperative as a condition\r\nfor fulfilling our obligation to peace.\r\nSimilarly, we must continue to keep in mind our\r\nresponsibility and commitment to a number of social\r\nand economic objectives. Those are specific and, in the\r\ncase of the Millennium Declaration, time-bound goals.\r\nIn the opinion of my delegation, our reform initiatives\r\nand methods must not only be motivated and inspired\r\nby those objectives, they must also respond to them.\r\nThat is because they are real and concern real people\r\nsomewhere — real people who are waiting for the\r\nUnited Nations to fulfil their expectations.\r\nAs a result of that, therefore, we must keep in\r\nmind during the reform process that reform is not an\r\nobjective in itself. Reform is justified by a more basic\r\nobjective, namely, to enhance our work and deliver the\r\nbenefits of development and peace. Therefore, the\r\nprogramme of work, which should be organized around\r\nthe objectives set out in the Millennium Declaration\r\nand the results of the main conferences, needs to\r\nsupport the Organization’s efforts in the field of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the proposal by the\r\nSecretary-General to create an additional Assistant\r\nSecretary-General post to support policy coherence and\r\nmanagement in the Department of Economic and\r\nSocial Affairs. We, however, would like to emphasize\r\nthat this should ensure that the development\r\nprogramme is the top priority of the Organization.\r\nMy delegation notes the attention paid by the\r\nSecretary-General to issues and activities concerning\r\nAfrica. In particular, we support the proposal to assign\r\nthe Secretary-General’s Adviser for Special\r\nAssignments in Africa the responsibility of\r\ncoordinating and guiding the reports and input for\r\nAfrica-related matters in the Secretariat and to transfer\r\nunder his responsibility the resources currently\r\nallocated to the Office of the Special Coordinator for\r\nAfrica and the Least Developed Countries.\r\nHuman rights, the promotion and protection of\r\nwhich is a bedrock requirement under the Charter for\r\nthe realization of our vision of a just and peaceful\r\nworld, is a subject of special interest to my delegation.\r\nTo that end, we support the proposal by which the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nwill consult with treaty bodies on new streamlined\r\nreporting procedures and submit recommendations to\r\nthe Secretary-General. Similarly, in connection with\r\nthe improvement of special procedures, we also support\r\nthe proposal by which the High Commissioner will\r\nundertake a review and make recommendations\r\ntowards enhancing their effectiveness and improving\r\nthe support provided.\r\nMy delegation understands the need to have more\r\npragmatic action at the field level to integrate human\r\nrights components. Many countries have started to\r\nadopt upstream projects in the context of the country\r\ncooperation framework. However, the principle of such\r\nprojects being country-driven should be the main\r\nconsideration in developing projects at the country\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nlevel. We would therefore like to express our concern\r\nabout proposals with a global approach including\r\nhuman rights elements at the field level that might not\r\nbe priorities of individual Member States, as every\r\ncountry has its own individual characteristics.\r\nMoreover, including such elements would be contrary\r\nto the principle of country-driven implementation of\r\noperational activities for development.\r\nTaking all that into consideration, it is the view of\r\nmy delegation that the proposal to simplify and\r\nimprove planning and budgeting merits consideration\r\nin order to eliminate some of the burdens of the current\r\narrangements. However, we would like to underline\r\nthat a streamlined mechanism should not compromise\r\nthe purpose of carrying out priority programmes\r\nmandated by Member States. With particular reference\r\nto the proposal to merge the intergovernmental review\r\nof plans and budgets now being performed by both the\r\nFifth Committee and the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination, under the aegis of the Fifth\r\nCommittee, we would suggest that careful\r\nconsideration be exercised in this matter.\r\nTurning to human resources management, we\r\nsupport the initiatives of the Secretary-General towards\r\nthe attainment of a world-class staff, to enable the\r\nSecretariat to deliver adequate services to Member\r\nStates. We, however, would like to emphasize that any\r\nhuman resources policy adopted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral needs to achieve the imperatives of\r\ngeographical diversity and gender balance, without\r\ncompromising excellence in the quality of personnel,\r\nwho are the strength of the Organization.\r\nWe believe it to be the responsibility of Member\r\nStates to consider carefully the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations contained in this report, and to\r\nsupport fully the decisions arrived at by the General\r\nAssembly. It is important to ensure that process is\r\nMember State-driven, not Secretariat-driven. We must\r\nfurther ensure that the process is transparent and\r\nparticipatory. With that in mind, Indonesia stands ready\r\nand willing to offer its full participation.\r\nMr. Hasmy (Malaysia): I would like to express\r\nour gratitude and thanks to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive and all-encompassing report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387). We commend the clear,\r\nmethodical and action-oriented manner in which he\r\npresents his case for reform and innovation. The report\r\nindicates very clearly the Secretary-General’s bold, yet\r\npractical, agenda and far-sighted vision for the United\r\nNations in the new millennium as it confronts the many\r\nchallenges that lie ahead. We also commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his strong determination to effect\r\nthose changes. The report is testimony to his firm and\r\nunshakeable commitment to the United Nations as the\r\nmain and indispensable vehicle towards increased\r\nmultilateralism in the complex and interconnected\r\nworld we live in today. I would also like to\r\nacknowledge the role in, and contribution to, this\r\nexercise of Deputy Secretary-General Louise Fréchette.\r\nLet me also say that my delegation associates\r\nitself with the views of the Chair of the Group of 77\r\nexpressed yesterday at in this body with regard to the\r\nreport.\r\nMany of the proposals and recommendations for\r\naction contained in the report are commendable and\r\ncan be supported and implemented, especially those\r\nthat fall under the Secretary-General’s own authority.\r\nOthers that directly affect Member States would, of\r\ncourse, have to be dealt with by them through the\r\nappropriate consultative mechanisms.\r\nMy delegation fully shares the view that the\r\nreform and revitalization of the Organization should be\r\nan ongoing process involving all of its organs: the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic\r\nand Social Council and the Secretariat. Reform is not\r\njust for the sake of reform but has the purpose of\r\nreorienting the Organization and its entire system to the\r\nneeds and challenges of our times. We agree that much\r\nhas been achieved. But much remains to be\r\naccomplished. There is a need to ensure that the\r\nOrganization will be able not only to carry out its\r\ntraditional role and functions but also to perform new\r\ntasks and fulfil new goals in the context of the rapidly\r\nevolving global situation.\r\nThe General Assembly has over the past 10 years\r\nadopted various decisions and resolutions to revitalize\r\nitself. The ongoing efforts by the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to rejuvenate the exercise by\r\nfocusing on the implementation of previous resolutions\r\nshould be pursued. We have, in fact, made some\r\nmodest achievements such as, among other things, the\r\nmuch welcomed clustering of certain items on the\r\nagenda of the General Assembly and better\r\nmanagement of conference time and resources. The\r\ndecision to have early elections of the President and\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nVice-Presidents of the Assembly and the Chairs of the\r\nMain Committees has also enabled the Organization to\r\nplan its timetable more efficiently, thereby contributing\r\nto a more effective and meaningful debate.\r\nMy delegation fully agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s observation that no reform of the United\r\nNations would be complete without the reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. Progress on that reform, regrettably,\r\nhas been painfully slow in spite of almost a decade of\r\ndeliberations among Member States. We also share his\r\nview that a reform process that consisted only of an\r\nincrease in Council membership would be unlikely to\r\nstrengthen the Council unless it were accompanied by\r\nthe capacity to make prompt and realistic decisions and\r\nthe political will to act on them. We strongly endorse\r\nhis proposal for a codification of the recent changes in\r\nthe practice of the Council so that they may become\r\npermanent rather than remaining ad hoc or temporary\r\nfeatures which may lapse over time.\r\nAs an incoming member of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, Malaysia places great hopes and\r\nexpectations on the further strengthening of that\r\nimportant Council and will work with others towards\r\nthat end. We strongly support the dialogue process that\r\nhas been established with the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization, thereby\r\ngiving the United Nations the important role that it\r\nshould play in influencing development and socio-\r\neconomic policies and strategies that affect Member\r\nStates. We warmly welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nintention to ensure improved Secretariat support for the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil. That is essential for the more effective\r\nfunctioning of those two principal organs of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMy delegation also agrees that the United Nations\r\nhas a story to tell, and that it must be told in a way that\r\nwill raise the Organization’s prestige and credibility\r\nand inspire confidence in, and respect for, it. As the\r\nmost truly universal intergovernmental organization\r\nthat deals with a broad range of issues affecting\r\nhumanity, its achievements, disappointments and future\r\nexpectations should be told to its diverse audience so\r\nas to create a better appreciation of the many\r\nconstraints, difficulties and challenges that it faces, as\r\nwell of the opportunities that could be harnessed with\r\nthe support of Member States. The Department of\r\nPublic Information has an important role to play as an\r\ninformation conduit between the Organization and its\r\npeoples. Malaysia strongly supports the efforts to\r\nreposition the Department to face the challenges of the\r\nnew century so as to enable it to implement its\r\nmandate.\r\nThe Secretary-General had already submitted a\r\ncomprehensive review of the Department of Public\r\nInformation (A/AC.198/2002/2) to the Committee on\r\nInformation in May 2002. The actions proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General in his present report are very similar\r\nto those submitted to the Committee on Information.\r\nWe look forward to a fruitful discussion of this in the\r\nFourth Committee.\r\nAction 1, to submit to the General Assembly in\r\n2003 a thoroughly revised programme budget that\r\nbetter reflects the priorities agreed to at the Millennium\r\nAssembly, constitutes an important and commendable\r\nstep towards achieving the goals contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. It is proposed that attention\r\nshould also be given to achieving goals and targets set\r\nat other United Nations conferences and summits,\r\nparticularly the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development and the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. The revised budget suggested by the\r\nSecretary-General in that action should take into\r\naccount not only the goals and targets set in the\r\nMillennium Declaration but also the targets and goals\r\ncontained in the outcomes of other relevant\r\nconferences and summits.\r\nMalaysia welcomes the implementation plan that\r\nwill soon be developed to strengthen the effectiveness\r\nof the Organization’s presence in developing countries.\r\nThe proposed action plan which includes, inter alia,\r\njoint programming, pooling of resources, common\r\ndatabases and knowledge networks, dedicated support\r\nfor resident coordinators, and integrated planning,\r\nbudgeting and resources mobilization tools for\r\ncountries emerging from conflicts are, indeed, laudable\r\nand deserve strong support. These are practical\r\nmeasures designed to further enhance the effectiveness\r\nof the United Nations system, premised on the best and\r\nmost efficient utilization of its resources. We trust there\r\nwill be close consultations with national Governments,\r\nas the principal clients of United Nations in-country\r\nprogrammes and activities, in order to ensure the full\r\nparticipation of Member States in developing any new\r\nplanning mechanisms or instruments, including the\r\ncommon country assessment, common reporting and\r\njoint evaluations and resource mobilization tools at the\r\nnational level.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nWe also welcome the proposal for a document\r\nclarifying roles and responsibilities in the area of\r\ntechnical cooperation, which is to be prepared by a\r\ntarget date of September 2003. We believe that it will\r\nhelp address the problem of duplication and overlap.\r\nClarifying who does what in the area of technical\r\ncooperation is, indeed, very important, given the\r\nlimited resources, capabilities and programme-reach of\r\nthe international institutions.\r\nMy delegation supports the proposal to create an\r\nadditional position of Assistant Secretary-General to\r\nsupport policy coherence and management in the\r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs and the\r\nestablishment of a policy planning unit in that\r\nDepartment. In our view, the creation of such a post is\r\nimportant, as the issue of coherence is well reflected in\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus. It is, however, important to\r\navoid any duplication of mandates, and it is important\r\nthat the Assistant Secretary-General appointed should\r\nhave the responsibility and capacity to interact\r\neffectively with the institutional and other stakeholders\r\nidentified in the Monterrey Consensus, including the\r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization.\r\nGiven the special problems of Africa, we support\r\nthe proposal to have the Secretary-General’s Adviser\r\nfor Special Assignments in Africa coordinate and guide\r\nthe preparation of reports and input for Africa-related\r\ndebates of the General Assembly and its subsidiary\r\nbodies. To that end, resources allocated to the Office of\r\nthe Special Coordinator for Africa and Least\r\nDeveloped Countries should be transferred to the\r\nAdviser’s Office. This proposal is in line with the\r\nresolution adopted on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. We look forward to receiving more\r\ninformation from the Secretary-General on the\r\norganization and structure of the Office, as requested\r\nby the resolution. We support the merging of the\r\nSpecial Coordinator’s Office with the Office of the\r\nAdviser as a further effort to consolidate and\r\neffectively address the issues of development in Africa.\r\nMr. Laotegguelnodji (Chad), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal to enhance and increase the opportunities for\r\npromotion to the Professional level of the General\r\nService Staff. Such staff should be rewarded not only\r\nbecause they are a source of skill and expertise but also\r\nbecause they are the Organization’s priceless treasure,\r\nas they hold a large portion of the institutional memory\r\nof the United Nations. We also support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s idea to help United Nations staff balance\r\ntheir professional and private lives and to rejuvenate\r\nand reinvigorate the Organization by attracting and\r\nretraining younger people. In that regard, we fully\r\nsupport the continuing improvement in and innovation\r\nof the area of human resources management.\r\nOn the issue of human rights, my delegation takes\r\nnote of action 2 contained in the report. We note in\r\nparticular that the measures outlined in the report\r\npertain to the incorporation of human rights standards\r\ninto the country programmes of its specialized\r\nagencies, funds and programmes without any mention\r\nbeing made of requests by States or of collaboration\r\nwith them. This issue has been extensively debated as\r\nfar back as 1997, when the Secretary-General first\r\npresented a report on reforms (A/51/590 and Add.1-6).\r\nMy delegation was among those that were against this\r\nidea; our position on the issue has not changed.\r\nWe note also that in developing and implementing\r\na plan to strengthen human-rights-related actions at the\r\ncountry level, the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights would only be consulting with the\r\nUnited Nations Development Group and the Executive\r\nCommittee for Humanitarian Affairs. We certainly\r\nhope that Member States will have a role in the\r\nexercise, given the fact that these actions and\r\nprogrammes are to be implemented at the national\r\nlevel, which would necessarily require close\r\nconsultations with Governments.\r\nWe welcome the proposal that the High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights make\r\nrecommendations on new streamlined reporting\r\nprocedures, as proposed in action 3. However, since\r\nmembers of treaty bodies serve in their individual\r\ncapacities, and since not all parties are represented in\r\nany given treaty body at any given time, my delegation\r\nwould strongly recommend that the High\r\nCommissioner consult with Member States parties to\r\neach of the six treaties, as opposed to only Committee\r\nmembers. We also look forward to a proper discussion\r\nof the High Commissioner’s recommendations to the\r\nSecretary-General when he submits them in September\r\n2003.\r\nMy delegation is fully supportive of action 4. We\r\nhave long believed that the various special procedures\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\ncreated need to be more coherent. Special rapporteurs,\r\nfor instance, play an important role in the promotion\r\nand protection of human rights worldwide. Their\r\ncredibility will be greatly enhanced and their mandate\r\nrespected if they operate under the principles of\r\nfairness, objectivity and non-selectivity. In other\r\nwords, they must manifest the highest standards of\r\nprofessionalism in carrying out their mandates. It is in\r\nthat regard that the High Commissioner has a role to\r\nplay to ensure that these principles become a mainstay\r\nof the operationalization of the mandates of the special\r\nprocedures. Again, my delegation looks forward to\r\ndiscussing the recommendations to be put forward by\r\nthe High Commissioner in 2003 in that regard.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the concept of working\r\nbetter together, both within the system and with civil\r\nsociety. We note the intention to forge enhanced\r\ninteraction with civil society and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s decision to establish a high-level panel to\r\nmake recommendations in that regard. We note, too, his\r\nintention to establish a partnership office to coordinate\r\nthe relationship with the private sector. We welcome\r\nthese initiatives, but we must not lose sight of the\r\nessentially intergovernmental character of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe are particularly attracted to the new approach\r\nand different way of doing the business of the United\r\nNations advocated by the Secretary-General. However,\r\ngiven the sheer size of the United Nations and its entire\r\nsystem and the difficulty of effecting and managing\r\nchange involving a vast bureaucracy, the challenges are\r\nenormous and will require determined and sustained\r\neffort on the part of the Secretary-General and his staff\r\nas well as strong and sustained support by Member\r\nStates. The goals are clear and the strategies for the\r\nattainment of those goals appear to be sound. What\r\nremain are the determination and resolve or will to\r\ncarry the process forward in a step-by-step but\r\nexpeditious fashion involving all stake-holders.\r\nTherein lies the challenge. My delegation will play a\r\nconstructive role in the process.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): First and\r\nforemost, I would like, on behalf of my delegation, to\r\naddress my compliments to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the fruitful efforts he has made\r\ntogether with his outstanding team since 1997 to have\r\nour Organization adopt an innovative strategy\r\ncommensurate with the breadth, complexity and\r\ndiversity of the challenges which face mankind at the\r\nbeginning of this millennium.\r\nWhile in recent years we have observed real and\r\nlaudable progress in rationalizing United Nations\r\nactivities, it must be noted that in this particular area a\r\nnumber of improvements still seem to be necessary and\r\npossible, as suggested by the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport entitled “Strengthening of the United Nations:\r\nan agenda for further change” (A/57/387).\r\nWhile fully associating myself with the views\r\nexpressed so brilliantly by my good friend Ambassador\r\nAboul Gheit, Permanent Representative of Egypt, on\r\nbehalf of the African Group, I would like to briefly\r\nsingle out some aspects which, in our view, are of\r\nparticular importance.\r\nI reaffirm how firmly Senegal supports the\r\nproposal of the Secretary-General to ensure that the\r\nvarious components of our Organization work better\r\ntogether — I would almost say in synergy — to make\r\ntheir action more coordinated, more purposeful and\r\nmore effective. That is why we believe that the reforms\r\nshould measure up to the goals we have laid out by\r\nmeeting one fundamental criterion: efficiency. Thus,\r\nthe pooling of resources and the joint programming of\r\nactivities of the various components of the United\r\nNations should not undermine what the Organization\r\ndoes or lead to bottlenecks or overlapping in relations\r\nbetween the United Nations and the various areas in\r\nwhich it works.\r\nThis concern for efficiency and clarity should\r\nalso be strictly observed at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters, where the Secretary-General has created\r\nthe post of Adviser for Special Assignments in Africa,\r\nthus reflecting the resolve of the United Nations to get\r\nsolidly in step with the reiterated determination of the\r\nheads of State and the peoples of Africa to make the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nthe preferred framework for a strong alliance between\r\nthe continent and its partners.\r\nTo that end, we think it is of paramount\r\nimportance to ensure that the Adviser, far from\r\nconfining himself to preparing for routine meetings on\r\nAfrica, should also get down to the task of promoting\r\nand coordinating the support of all our friends for the\r\ngenuine implementation of NEPAD’s goals.\r\nThis concern for clarity is equally applicable to\r\nthe proposal of the Secretary-General that the\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\npartnership among the United Nations, civil society\r\nand the private sector should be strengthened in a\r\nmatter which is of considerable urgency these days,\r\nthat is the burning question of human rights.\r\nHow can we better ensure that these rights are\r\nexercised fully on the national and global levels? Is the\r\nsystem of treaties and special procedures of the\r\nCommission on Human Rights still well adapted to the\r\ncurrent international context? And what role can the\r\nUnited Nations play to modernize them if necessary?\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General has raised real\r\nissues and has sketched out a number of real replies\r\nwhich call for more dynamic and thorough — some\r\nmight even say holistic — consideration.\r\nIt is true that States parties to international legal\r\ninstruments on human rights are weighed down by\r\ncomplex, rigid and daunting obligations which are\r\ndifficult to perform, particularly the requirement to\r\nsubmit periodic reports according to strict timetables,\r\nreports whose relevance and frequency, and therefore\r\nunrealistic number, need to be reviewed in the light of\r\nthe additional constraints thus imposed on small\r\nMember States.\r\nNonetheless, Senegal maintains that it is up to\r\nStates parties, within the framework of competent\r\nstatutory bodies, to consider this range of problems,\r\nwhich will certainly require an amendment to\r\ninternational treaties. To that end, perhaps a joint\r\nmeeting of all States parties to the various international\r\ninstruments related to human rights could be convened\r\nas a special measure.\r\nIn any event, my delegation believes that today,\r\nwe must rationalize institutional and legal human rights\r\nmachinery, even in the thicket of the 40 existing special\r\nprocedures. In that connection, Senegal considers that\r\nthe comments of the African Group concerning the part\r\nof the Secretary-General’s report devoted to human\r\nrights should be taken into account in any reform\r\nproject — that is, reform of the institutional\r\narchitecture and of the modernization of human rights\r\nmechanisms, including in the context of United Nations\r\nactions to reach out to the public at large.\r\nMy delegation, therefore, highly values the\r\ncrucial role of the Department of Public Information,\r\nboth in promoting the objectives and strategies of the\r\nOrganization and in the regular follow-up of its\r\nprogrammes. More generally, my delegation would like\r\nto endorse the Secretary-General’s recommendations\r\naimed at establishing a policy of monitoring and\r\nevaluation of the information sector’s impact on the\r\nOrganization’s activities, which should be marked by\r\ntransparency and effectiveness. That unquestionably\r\njustifies the remodelling of Information Centres — an\r\nexercise that, in developing countries and particularly\r\nin Africa, must be carried out in a far-sighted, prudent\r\nand methodical way because of the lack of resources\r\navailable to the Centres and their positive impact on\r\nthe media environment of the countries concerned.\r\nAs a corollary, we must give some thought to the\r\nreal desirability and the exorbitant cost of the\r\nendless succession of summits, world conferences and\r\nother United Nations meetings — the Secretary-\r\nGeneral lists no fewer than 15,484 during the biennium\r\n2000-2001 — whose existence and disappointing\r\nresults erode, devalue or obliterate the value, relevance\r\nand authority of the regular and special sessions of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil — a body of which my country has just\r\nbecome a member.\r\nWith regard to the innumerable reports and\r\nfollow-ups — reports are estimated at 5,879 — which\r\nfew delegations have the leisure to read or even to\r\nperuse, my delegation would like to cite the chronic\r\nproblem of quality, volume and delays with regard to\r\npublishing documentation, deploring the fact that\r\nMember States — particularly those delegations that\r\nspeak French — are not always treated the same,\r\nthe sacrosanct principle of multilingualism\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\nHence the twofold need, first, to reduce\r\nsignificantly the number of official meetings and the\r\nfrightening volume of documentation, and secondly, to\r\nstrengthen the Department of Public Information with\r\nadequate budgetary resources and the means to, inter\r\nalia, update the United Nations web site daily in all\r\nofficial languages. That was proposed by Russia, which\r\nSenegal joins in criticizing the growing gap between\r\nEnglish and the other official languages, without\r\nprejudice regarding the urgent need, cited by the\r\nUnited States, to establish a reliable protection system\r\nfor global electronic information networks and the\r\nInternet through the creation of a world culture of\r\ncybersecurity.\r\nAlso important is the recurrent question of\r\nstrengthening the working relations between the\r\nDepartment of Public Information and the Department\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nof Peacekeeping Operations so as to ensure, through\r\nthe efficient management of information, the increased\r\neffectiveness and legitimacy of peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nIn that connection, the problem of the financial\r\nfragility of the United Nations arises once again with\r\neven more urgency because of the exorbitant and\r\nmounting arrears in assessments, which by 30\r\nSeptember amounted to $2.4 billion, half of which is\r\nowed by one Member State, principally for\r\npeacekeeping operations. Such a situation, totally at\r\nodds with commitments proclaimed elsewhere,\r\nseriously compromises the capacity of the United\r\nNations to carry out its mandates and to reimburse\r\ntroop contributors. With the assistance of Member\r\nStates, the Secretary-General absolutely must resolve\r\nthe daunting equation faced by the developing\r\ncountries, particularly the least developed countries,\r\nsuch as Senegal. The least developed countries suffer\r\nconsiderably from the arrears and delays in\r\nreimbursement, to the extent that some States run the\r\nrisk — and we have seen this repeatedly in the recent\r\npast — of having to confront situations of revolt,\r\ninstability and even armed rebellion sometimes caused\r\nby rules and delays with respect to the payment of\r\nsums owed by the United Nations for peacekeeping\r\noperations.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the report of the\r\nSecretary-General has not lost sight, furthermore, of\r\nthe need to rationalize administrative and budgetary\r\npractices in order to facilitate the effective\r\nmanagement of the Organization’s priorities. In that\r\ncontext, the revised programme budget to be presented\r\nin 2003 by the Secretary-General must somehow\r\nintegrate the development goals set by the Millennium\r\nSummit and those of the Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nSummits, as well as the other priorities set forth in the\r\nframework of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment.\r\nIn the process of updating and fine-tuning\r\nprocedures, it is especially important that scrupulous\r\nrespect be paid to the monitoring and evaluation\r\nmechanisms covering programme planning and\r\nexecution as well as human resource management,\r\ntaking due account of the enlightening observations\r\nand recommendations of the Advisory Committee on\r\nAdministrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ),\r\nwhich are generally endorsed by the Fifth Committee.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like once again to pay\r\ntribute to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and to Deputy\r\nSecretary-General Louise Fréchette for this excellent\r\nreport, which is edifying in many respects and which,\r\nenriched by the contributions of Member States, will be\r\nas valuable as the effectiveness of the proposals that\r\nare acted upon. That is why we think it crucial to\r\ncategorize the proposals and to determine the levels at\r\nwhich their implementation should be carried out, with\r\nthe understanding that appropriate administrative\r\nleeway and budgetary flexibility should be accorded\r\nthe Secretary-General — of course, with the hindsight\r\nof the ACABQ.\r\nIntroducing those changes to the architecture of\r\nthe United Nations must obey certain principles of\r\nstructural and managerial order. Furthermore, in our\r\nview, it will realize a philosophy that is gradually\r\ngaining ground in an Organization intended to\r\nrepudiate the world order of 1945, in order to celebrate\r\nin its actions the perennial ideals of justice and\r\ndemocracy. In other words, the field of reform is so\r\nvast that, we hope, Member States will soon reconsider\r\nthe working methods of bodies such as the Security\r\nCouncil and its growing propensity to invest in areas of\r\nactivity that are under the purview of the General\r\nAssembly or of the Economic and Social Council,\r\ninstead of focusing systematically, rather than\r\ncircumstantially, on its true statutory reason for being:\r\nto promote peace and security.\r\nThe United Nations must be more ready to\r\nshoulder its primary responsibilities and to realize the\r\nhumanistic principle of multilateralism by resolutely\r\nrising to the requirements of democratic transparency,\r\nwhich the new configuration of international relations\r\nmust necessarily reflect.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nstrengthening of an institution consists of strengthening\r\nits organs. The fact that we are at present engaged in\r\nthe task of finding the best way to improve the\r\nfunctioning of three of the five major organs of the\r\nUnited Nations that are still active is eloquent evidence\r\nof the need to adapt the Organization to the demands of\r\nan international society which is itself evolving\r\nconstantly.\r\nThe reforms in each of those three organs are\r\nbeing carried out separately, but they all seek the same\r\ngoal: to make those organs more effective instruments\r\nfor achieving our common goals. But the modalities of\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\neach of those processes are different. With respect to\r\nthe Security Council, we are seeking the reform of its\r\nmembership in order to make it more representative\r\nand more democratic. As for the General Assembly, we\r\nare attempting to revitalize it so that its decisions\r\nregain their authority and political legitimacy. In the\r\nSecretariat, the goal is changes in its functioning to\r\nimprove its efficiency. Those three processes are\r\nclosely linked and, to an extent, the results of each\r\nprocess will affect the results of the other two. But in\r\nspite of those close connections, we believe the reform\r\nprocesses should continue to be carried out as they\r\nhave been so far: separately, each one in its respective\r\nsphere of competence.\r\nWe are meeting today to examine the measures\r\nthat the Secretary-General proposes in his report\r\n(A/57/387 and Corr.1) in order to make changes in\r\nspecific areas under his responsibility. The common\r\nidea underpinning all those measures is that the\r\nOrganization should focus its activities on issues that\r\nare most important at present and on those that will be\r\nmost important in the future.\r\nUruguay fully agrees with the objectives set out\r\nin the report and the general orientation of the changes\r\nproposed. We particularly welcome initiatives to\r\nstrengthen institutions and mechanisms that ensure\r\nuniversality and respect for human rights. The great\r\nwork accomplished by the United Nations over the first\r\ntwo decades of its existence, which put the protection\r\nof human rights on the international agenda in a\r\ndefinitive and irreversible manner, cannot be left\r\nincomplete. To ensure that human beings the world\r\nover have full enjoyment of their rights, we must\r\nstrengthen monitoring mechanisms and develop means\r\nto bring offenders before the law. The proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General are an important step in that\r\ndirection.\r\nUruguay is now in a position to support many of\r\nthe measures proposed in the report, not only in the\r\narea of human rights but also in the areas of public\r\ninformation and the budgeting and planning process.\r\nWe have doubts on some of those measures. In\r\nthe course of the informal consultations held last week,\r\nthe Group of 77 asked the Secretary-General a number\r\nof questions. We trust that the additional information to\r\nbe provided by the Secretary-General in response to\r\nthose questions will dispel our doubts.\r\nMy delegation understands that, without\r\nprejudice to these misgivings, the Secretary-General\r\nshould proceed to put into practice those measures\r\nwhose implementation does not require the approval of\r\nthe Assembly, for example, the preparation of\r\ncombined reports, which would be more condensed and\r\nconcise. When we see the results of that measure, we\r\ncan decide whether it is a good idea. This procedure of\r\ncarrying out a measure then judging the results should\r\nbe applied to all those measures that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has the power to put into practice.\r\nWith regard to measures relating to the system of\r\nplanning and budgeting, I would like to recall that the\r\nOrganization has already demonstrated its spirit of\r\nrenewal and its capacity to adapt in that area. That was\r\ndemonstrated by the introduction of results-based\r\nbudgeting.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Secretary-General\r\nhas based his proposed changes in the field of\r\nbudgeting and planning on the criterion of reflecting\r\nthe priorities of the international community as\r\nformulated in the Millennium Declaration. It is clear\r\nthat in order to identify those priorities, we have to\r\ndraw on the outcomes of the Monterrey Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the Johannesburg\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has promised us for next year a revised\r\nprogramme budget that better reflects the agreed\r\npriorities. We look forward with great interest to\r\nreceiving that text.\r\nBut, above all else, focusing our efforts on\r\npriorities will depend on changes in the working\r\nmethods and functioning of the General Assembly. In\r\nthe consultations on the revitalization of the Assembly,\r\nwe will continue to suggest measures to enable this\r\norgan to focus on the most important issues.\r\nThe recommendation for improving planning of\r\nthe budgetary process is well supported in the report.\r\nThe proposal for a mid-term plan focused on a period\r\nof time closer to the present is in keeping with the\r\nchanging challenges the Organization faces. Similarly,\r\nan outline of the budget, which would be detailed and\r\nbriefer, combined with the mid-term plan, will\r\nundoubtedly facilitate the process of negotiating the\r\nbudget and its approval.\r\nWe have certain reservations about the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s request for greater flexibility in transferring\r\nresources between programmes and budgetary items.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nThe Secretary-General should provide us with more\r\ndetailed information. The problem lies in the fact that\r\nin our national administration — and I believe this is\r\nthe case in other national administrations — a\r\nfundamental principle of planning and budgetary\r\nperformance is the prohibition on transferring funding\r\nfrom one programme to another. That prohibition exists\r\nat all levels of national administration. Even in the case\r\nof the very limited budget of our own mission, we\r\ncannot reallocate funds. I do not know whether it\r\nwould be acceptable to apply in an international\r\norganization practices prohibited in national\r\nadministrations.\r\nFurthermore, we are concerned that funds\r\ndestined for programmes assisting developing countries\r\nmight be reallocated to finance other activities that the\r\nSecretary-General considers a high priority. Naturally,\r\nwe have complete confidence in the good judgement\r\nand discretion of the Secretary-General. But it might\r\nhappen that in some cases, his priorities may be\r\ndifferent from ours. Something that continues to occur\r\nis that funds allocated for peacekeeping operations are\r\nused to finance other expenses of the Organization. We\r\ncannot agree with that practice. Delays in the payment\r\nof the personnel of a peacekeeping operation, in\r\nparticular, delays in reimbursement for the use of\r\nequipment has created financial problems for us,\r\nsometimes serious ones. For that reason, I suggest the\r\nrequest for greater flexibility in reassigning resources\r\nshould be accompanied by proposals for some kind of\r\nconsultative procedure or prior supervisory procedure\r\nin which the General Assembly or the countries\r\nconcerned would take part.\r\nThe Secretary-General is very eloquent in\r\nhighlighting the deficiencies that exist in the budgeting\r\nand planning process. There is no doubt that radical\r\nchanges should be made. The Group of 77 would like\r\nto know, among other things, if the Secretary-General\r\nis suggesting the elimination of the Committee for\r\nProgramme (CPC) and Coordination, a possibility that\r\nshould not be dismissed — after, of course, the case\r\nhas been properly made. That body, according to the\r\nreport, is costly, complicates procedures and results in\r\nduplication. Certainly, if we eliminate the CPC — a\r\nbody, I would note in passing, of which Uruguay has\r\nbeen, and is still, a member — the work of the Fifth\r\nCommittee would be increased. However, this could be\r\npartly offset by a slight increase in the membership of\r\nthe Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions.\r\nThe report we are considering abounds in ideas\r\nand proposals that give my delegation considerable\r\nfood for thought. We hope to have an opportunity to\r\nexpress our views at subsequent stages of this process.\r\nMr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): We\r\njoin other Member States in welcoming the\r\nconsideration of the Secretary-General’s report on\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. The findings and\r\nrecommendations contained in the report merit our\r\nserious consideration.\r\nMy delegation agrees with the view of the\r\nSecretary-General that United Nations reform is not an\r\nevent but an ongoing process, with room for further\r\nimprovement. In this regard, we consider the report to\r\nbe a timely and appropriate initiative as a follow-up to\r\nthe first phase of the 1997 reform initiative.\r\nIn considering the issue of Security Council\r\nreform, we need to proceed in a manner that is both\r\ndemocratic and reflective of our current environment.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that, due to the inter-\r\nlinkages between the Council’s structure and its\r\ndecision-making procedures, these issues are best\r\nconsidered in a single context. With regard to the issue\r\nof enlargement, since we believe that as many Member\r\nStates as possible should be given the opportunity to\r\nserve on the Council, we consider the suggestion of\r\nincreasing only the number of non-permanent seats to\r\nbe a viable option.\r\nOf equal importance is the need to strengthen the\r\nrole of the Economic and Social Council, in the light of\r\nthe important global economic and social concerns that\r\nit is being called upon to address. We would like to\r\nacknowledge the progress made in organizing its work\r\nto give greater focus to thematic issues such as the\r\nestablishment of dialogue between the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, the Bretton Woods institutions and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization. We believe that it is\r\nimportant for us to follow up and hold periodic reviews\r\non concretizing this channel of cooperation. At the\r\nsame time, we need to ensure that the agenda and\r\nformat of the Economic and Social Council are more\r\nfocused and that effective preparations are made for its\r\nsession.\r\nThe holding of numerous United Nations global\r\nconferences has burdened not only the Secretariat but\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nalso its Member States. We acknowledge that United\r\nNations global conferences and the Millennium\r\nDeclaration have had a positive impact through the\r\npromotion of international cooperation on issues of\r\nimportance, inter alia, in the field of development.\r\nHowever, we believe that the time has come to take\r\nstock of the results achieved so far in those forums. In\r\nparticular, my delegation is of the view that, from now\r\non, emphasis should be placed on the process of\r\nimplementation of the outcomes.\r\nLet me now turn to actions to reform human\r\nrights mechanisms. All four areas identified in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report are important. Of these, my\r\ndelegation places particular emphasis on the need to\r\nstreamline the reporting procedures to the six treaty\r\nbodies. We believe that progress is required in both\r\ndirections: greater coordination and standardization of\r\nwork among the committees and reduction of the\r\nburden on the States parties. In all cases, the integrity\r\nof the treaty bodies should be upheld. We would also\r\nlike to point out that endeavours to mainstream human\r\nrights into all activities of the United Nations should be\r\nsustained and strengthened.\r\nThe reform policy of the Department of Public\r\nInformation should focus on selective and important\r\nfields, but only after a cost-effective assessment is\r\nundertaken. Regarding its structural reform, it would\r\nbe better to make changes to the existing organization\r\nthan to establish a new one.\r\nWe further believe that structural reform should\r\nbe implemented in line with the information\r\ntechnology trends of the twenty-first century. The\r\ninformation age in which we live has made it much\r\neasier to access information. In this regard, we\r\nwelcome the integration of 13 United Nations\r\nInformation Centres in Western Europe into a regional\r\nhub. Apart from establishing an effective information\r\nhub, this process will conserve the resources needed\r\nfor pursuing priority activities. In due course, a similar\r\napproach could be adopted for the other regions.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation is of the view that printed\r\npublications should be further streamlined and reduced,\r\nin light of the Department of Public Information’s plan\r\nto strengthen and centralize its Web-based\r\ncommunication.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s submission of a thoroughly revised\r\nprogramme budget for the biennium 2004-2005 that\r\nappropriately reflects the priorities set by the\r\nMillennium Declaration and other major conferences.\r\nWe hope that, in the preparation and submission\r\nof the next biennium budget, the Secretariat will carry\r\nout a critical review of the current programmes and\r\nactivities, and identify outputs and activities which are\r\nconsidered obsolete, of marginal usefulness or\r\nineffective. Those outputs and activities should be\r\nlisted and presented to the General Assembly as a part\r\nof the proposed programme budget, whereby the\r\nMember States could decide which outputs and\r\nactivities should be terminated and which ones should\r\nbe kept alive in our future work programme.\r\nIn the case of new programmes, my delegation\r\nsupports the inclusion of sunset provisions to ensure\r\nthat regular reviews are made, and believes that\r\nrenewals should be granted only by explicit action of\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nWe also stress that the multifarious trust funds\r\nshould be consolidated and their management\r\nstreamlined, so as to improve the overall control and\r\nadministration of the funds.\r\nRegarding the allocation of resources to\r\npriorities, my delegation concurs with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s assessment that the current planning and\r\nbudgeting process should be streamlined. The\r\ncoherence and coordination among budgeting,\r\nimplementation and evaluation processes should be\r\nfurther strengthened so that one phase of the budget\r\ncycle may serve as a framework for the subsequent\r\nphases.\r\nMy delegation further believes that the reform\r\nproposals of the two-year medium-term plan, the\r\nrealignment of the functions of the Committee on\r\nProgramme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee,\r\nand the strengthening of evaluation and monitoring\r\nshould be discussed in detail and elaborated within the\r\nappropriate bodies of the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation has taken note of the proposal to\r\ngrant the Secretary-General more flexibility in\r\nreallocating programmes and between staff and non-\r\nstaff costs. In our view, should any change in the\r\ncurrent mechanism be deemed necessary after further\r\ndeliberations, it should be carried out in a way that\r\nenhances the efficient use of resources and ensures\r\nmanagerial accountability.\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nThe United Nations staff is an important asset and\r\na vital link to the performance of this Organization.\r\nThe successful implementation of the programmes and\r\nmandates is very much dependent upon the\r\nperformance of the staff. Therefore, in order to\r\nrevitalize the Organization, its staff must be highly\r\nmotivated, competent and up to the task.\r\nIn the past, we have seen many cases of\r\ncompetent young professionals leaving the\r\nOrganization due to lack of career prospects and other\r\nreasons. In order to attract, motivate and retain a highly\r\ncompetent staff as a matter of priority, we must put a\r\nreasonable and transparent personal management\r\nsystem in place.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the new system of\r\nmanagement put into operation on 1 May 2002. We\r\nhope that this new system will be instrumental in\r\nenhancing objectivity and transparency in recruitment,\r\nplacement and promotion. As has been proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General, horizontal staff mobility must be\r\nenhanced throughout the United Nations system. The\r\nperformance appraisal should be further reviewed.\r\nMoreover, delegation of authority should follow clear\r\nlines of authority and stress managerial responsibility\r\nand accountability.\r\nRegarding the Secretary-General’s proposal to lift\r\nthe restrictions on the promotion of General Service\r\nstaff to the Professional category, my delegation still\r\nbelieves that the national competitive examination\r\nprogramme is the best and fairest means of recruiting\r\nprofessional staff to the Organization at the entry level.\r\nThis is especially appropriate in the light of the need\r\nfor equal treatment between internal and external\r\ncandidates, the age profile of the staff, and equitable\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\nAnother matter of concern to my delegation is the\r\nproposal to create a new Assistant-Secretary-General\r\npost in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\r\nMy delegation would like to see further consideration\r\nof this matter in the context of the next biennium\r\nbudget before we make a final decision.\r\nMy delegation takes note that many of the\r\nproposals contained in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nhave potential financial implications. While not\r\nviewing the reform process as only a budget-cutting\r\nexercise, my delegation strongly believes that\r\nbudgetary discipline should be one of the guiding\r\nprinciples in our deliberations on the proposed reform\r\ninitiatives.\r\nIn closing, my delegation looks forward to\r\nparticipating actively in the discussions of the reform\r\npackage proposed by the Secretary-General with a\r\nview to achieving our common objective of a\r\nrevitalized United Nations.\r\nMr. imonović (Croatia): We are grateful to the\r\nSecretary-General for the preparation of the document\r\nentitled “Strengthening of the United Nations: an\r\nagenda for further change”, which represents another\r\nstage in the ongoing process of reform of the United\r\nNations. We believe that we must move forward in this\r\nprocess even more quickly than we have until now. In\r\nthis statement, I will mention only some priorities.\r\nIn order to be more efficient, we need to\r\nstrengthen the main bodies of the United Nations and\r\ntheir cooperation so as to be able to avoid overlaps and\r\nduplication and to encourage the complementarity of\r\nour work. The Economic and Social Council has\r\nalready started to undertake steps towards the\r\nrationalization of its work and better coordination\r\nbetween its functional commissions and various United\r\nNations agencies, funds and programmes. The process\r\nof revitalization of the General Assembly has just\r\nbegun and we believe that we need to take bigger steps\r\nand decisions in order to make this universal forum\r\nstronger, its work more efficient and its decisions more\r\nrespected.\r\nAs there is a broad consensus on some issues, we\r\nbelieve that, with dedicated joint efforts and the\r\nleadership of the President of the General Assembly,\r\nwe can move forward in quite a short period of time.\r\nThe process of the reform of the Security Council will\r\nprobably take longer, but we should continue with the\r\ndialogue. We need creative thinking and probably a\r\nsort of package deal in which each of us will gain more\r\nthan lose. Let me remind members that the dialogue on\r\nSecurity Council reform has already had some\r\nbeneficial side effects, for example better transparency\r\nand the opening of the Council’s work.\r\nCooperation between the main United Nations\r\nbodies is also improving. In 2002, the participation of\r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council in\r\nthe deliberations of the Security Council has become\r\nan established practice whenever appropriate. The\r\nsame applies to the participation of the President of the\r\nSecurity Council in the work of the Economic and\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nSocial Council. The ad hoc groups on Africa of the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nare also cooperating closely. If the experiment with the\r\nestablishment of the Economic and Social Council’s\r\nAd Hoc Advisory Group on Guinea-Bissau turns out to\r\nbe successful, which I firmly believe it will, it will\r\npave the way for similar future post-conflict peace-\r\nbuilding activities and open a whole new chapter\r\nregarding possible close cooperation between the\r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council\r\nin conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building.\r\nThe work of the General Assembly — especially its\r\nSecond and Third Committees — and the Economic\r\nand Social Council should be better coordinated as\r\nwell. The issue has been discussed at the level of the\r\nPresidents of the two bodies, but it requires more\r\nsystematic efforts and a comprehensive solution.\r\nFinally, the Economic and Social Council’s\r\ncooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nthe World Trade Organization should be strengthened\r\nand better structured. This cooperation is beneficial to\r\nboth. The Bretton Woods institutions will thereby\r\nincrease their legitimacy, while the Economic and\r\nSocial Council will benefit from its increased influence\r\nand leverage in global decision-making.\r\nWe fully support the Secretary-General’s opinion\r\nthat we must align our activities with priorities. We\r\nhave clear instructions and goals that we all agreed\r\nupon in the Millennium Declaration. In that regard, we\r\nsupport the intention of the Secretary-General to\r\nsubmit to the General Assembly in 2003 a thoroughly\r\nrevised programme budget that better reflects the\r\npriorities agreed to at the Millennium Assembly. We\r\nalso commend the Secretary-General for suggesting\r\nthat non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the\r\nprivate sector be included much more in our work. We\r\nshould be open to cooperation and should be creative in\r\nfinding new ways to bring NGOs and the private sector\r\non board.\r\nIn today’s globalizing world, efforts to promote\r\nand protect human rights have, or should have, a\r\nuniversal character. Therefore, we fully welcome the\r\nsection of the report concerned with strengthening\r\nhuman rights. We share the opinion of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that Member States should be governed, in\r\nvoting on and debating issues before the Commission\r\non Human Rights, by the genuine effort to strengthen\r\nhuman rights throughout the world. Attainment of\r\nhuman rights promotion and protection goals should\r\nnot be diverted by various political deals, and the\r\ncredibility of the Commission should not be\r\njeopardized.\r\nBesides the Commission on Human Rights, there\r\nare a number of treaty bodies and human rights\r\nmechanisms and procedures that constitute a large and\r\nintricate framework. The size and complexity of this\r\nsystem should be addressed by a more coordinated\r\napproach to their activities. This is especially true\r\nwhen we look at the reporting requirements of the\r\ncommittees under major human rights treaties and\r\nconventions, which should be standardized and\r\nstreamlined.\r\nThe Republic of Croatia firmly believes that\r\nefforts for the promotion and protection of human\r\nrights must begin at the national level. Therefore, we\r\nstrongly support the proposed action to strengthen\r\nhuman-rights-related United Nations activities at the\r\ncountry level.\r\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that we must\r\nmove more quickly in the reform process. We thus\r\nsupport the intention of the Secretary-General to\r\nundertake, within his authority, some of the actions\r\ncited in the report. We think that the report offers good\r\nguidelines regarding activities that should be agreed\r\nupon among States, and that we should not delay our\r\ndeliberations. My delegation is ready to actively\r\nparticipate in that process.\r\nMr. Nambiar (India): On behalf of India, I am\r\nhappy to participate in this debate on strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations system and to have the opportunity to\r\noffer the comments of my delegation on the proposals\r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387). We would like to express\r\nour appreciation to the Deputy Secretary-General,\r\nMs. Louise Fréchette, for the detailed explanations she\r\ngave during various interactions and at the informal\r\nconsultations convened by the President of the General\r\nAssembly on 24 October 2002.\r\nWe would like to convey our deep appreciation to\r\nthe Secretary-General for coming forward with a set of\r\ncomprehensive proposals for continuing his reform\r\nagenda as a sequel to the proposals that he presented at\r\nthe beginning of his first term, in July 1997 (see\r\nA/51/950 and Add.1-6). The proposals cover various\r\nfunctional areas and the working of the Organization\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nand give suggestions for improvement from both\r\nstrategic and practical perspectives.\r\nLike many other delegations, India looks upon\r\nreform as a continuing process — a kind of work in\r\nprogress. The United Nations has had several reform\r\nexercises, beginning with the expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil in the mid-1960s. Planning and programme\r\nbudgets were introduced in the mid-1970s, and\r\nattempts at restructuring the intergovernmental\r\nmachinery and Secretariat support structures in the\r\neconomic and social field were made in the late 1980s.\r\nOver the past three years there have been attempts to\r\nrevitalize the working of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council. The reform proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General form part of that sequence of\r\nexercises. It is for the Member States to try to give\r\neffect and substance to this felt need to improve the\r\nworking of the United Nations.\r\nLike many other delegations, India has expressed\r\nbroad political support for the process of reforms. We\r\nhave done this at different levels since the proposals of\r\nthe Secretary-General for reforms were presented last\r\nmonth. This is in line with our belief that the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and the\r\nenhancement of its responsiveness to the priorities of\r\nMember States are critical, particularly for the\r\ndeveloping countries that constitute the vast majority\r\nof its membership.\r\nBefore commenting on specific elements of the\r\npackage of proposals put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, it is pertinent to recall that some of the other\r\nagenda items being considered by the General\r\nAssembly are also related to this item. We have in\r\nmind, in particular, the items relating to the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly (agenda item\r\n53) and to the integrated follow-up to global\r\nconferences (agenda item 92). It is important to take a\r\nholistic view of the structures and processes so that the\r\nreforms and changes sought to be introduced under the\r\nvarious items pull together in the same direction and\r\nendure in the long run.\r\nThe Secretary-General has clarified at the outset\r\nthat the reform proposals should not be seen as an\r\nexercise in cost-cutting. The reform measures should\r\nhave the primary objective of increasing the efficiency\r\nand effectiveness of the Organization. If, at the end of\r\nthe exercise, it is found that the costs will go up as a\r\nresult of the restructuring, Member States should\r\ndemonstrate the requisite political will to support the\r\nreform measures by agreeing to such increase in\r\nexpenses.\r\nWe note that there are some reform measures that\r\nare within the competence of the Secretary-General and\r\nthat effect can be given to these under his own\r\nauthority. It is only in those areas that require the prior\r\napproval of Member States or where there is need for\r\njoint action with Member States that he will need the\r\nGeneral Assembly to provide specific authorization.\r\nEven here, we discern that there are some measures\r\nwhich could be implemented without much difficulty.\r\nThere are some areas where a process could be initiated\r\nafter the General Assembly authorizes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to launch such process.\r\nThere are still other areas where Member States\r\nmay need to seek clarification before authorizing the\r\nSecretary-General to effect changes or initiate\r\nprocesses. We feel that any decision or resolution by\r\nthe General Assembly on the reform proposals will\r\nneed to bring out these categories clearly and spell out\r\nthe position of Member States in some detail.\r\nAs time is limited, we shall not comment on each\r\nof the numerous proposals made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Instead, we shall give some comments on just\r\na few. We agree wholeheartedly with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that no reform of the United Nations would be\r\ncomplete without a restructuring of the Security\r\nCouncil to make it more representative and to invest its\r\nactions with legitimacy and authority. We continue to\r\nattach a high degree of importance to the reform and\r\nrestructuring of the Security Council, including\r\nexpansion of its membership in both the permanent and\r\nthe non-permanent categories, with adequate\r\nrepresentation of the developing countries among the\r\nnew permanent and non-permanent members.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General in according\r\nthe highest priority to the achievement of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. This is a testimony to\r\nthe priority attached by the Secretary-General to socio-\r\neconomic development and his commitment to making\r\nsocio-economic development the centrepiece of United\r\nNations activities.\r\nThe Secretary-General has spoken for all of us by\r\ncalling for fewer meetings and fewer reports. However,\r\nthe critical task is to determine what to include and\r\nwhat to exclude. Given the size and diversity of this\r\nworld body, this is an area that requires careful\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nconsideration and agreement at a political level. We\r\nfeel it would be optimal for the Secretary-General to\r\ncome up with a set of proposals on reducing both the\r\nnumber of meetings and the volume of documentation\r\nalong the lines suggested in the section on serving\r\nMember States, for consideration by the Member\r\nStates.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General on the need\r\nto continuously update the programme of work, and to\r\nidentify and dispense with mandates and activities that\r\nare no longer relevant. The sunset provisions should\r\ncover both new mandates and existing activities. If that\r\nis not done we shall have the anomalous situation of\r\nsubjecting every new initiative and mandate to specific\r\ntime-limits, while those items that have stretched out\r\nover the years will continue to figure on the agendas of\r\nvarious bodies long after becoming completely\r\nobsolete. Without doubt, the General Assembly will\r\nhave to assume the responsibility for reviewing and\r\nrenewing mandates through explicit action.\r\nWe welcome the proposal by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the field of human rights to initiate\r\nprocesses to rationalize, streamline and reduce the\r\nburden of reporting requirements, particularly for\r\ndeveloping countries. We trust that the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights will consult\r\nMember States at the appropriate stage before\r\nfinalizing his recommendations formulated in\r\nconsultation with treaty bodies. Similarly, we also\r\nexpect consultations with Member States on the review\r\nof special procedures.\r\nWe are somewhat concerned by the proposals\r\ncontained in paragraphs 50 and 51 of the report, by\r\nwhich the resident coordinator system at the country\r\nlevel, which oversees operational activities for\r\ndevelopment and development cooperation, would be\r\nmandated to incorporate human rights activities at the\r\ncountry level. Our concern stems from the possibility\r\nthat the very limited resources currently available for\r\ntechnical cooperation in development areas, and\r\nparticularly in crucial areas of human resources\r\ndevelopment, would now be diverted to human rights,\r\ngood governance and other softer areas of\r\ndevelopment. Although many of the international\r\nconferences have pledged additional resources for\r\ndevelopment, capacity-building and technical\r\ncooperation, these have hardly been forthcoming. In\r\nsuch circumstances, entrusting the resident coordinator\r\nsystem with promoting human rights at the country\r\nlevel would only be at the expense of traditional\r\ntechnical cooperation. That would hardly be acceptable\r\nto most developing countries.\r\nThere are also two other attendant implications.\r\nFirst, there would be a tendency to shift focus and\r\nresources away from traditional areas on the pretext of\r\ncountry-driven programming, that is, on the excuse that\r\nthe United Nations system is merely responding to\r\nchanges in the “demands” of recipient countries.\r\nSecondly, grant assistance would be utilized for\r\nadvocacy and advice from outside, which is not a\r\nwelcome development and which could, at times, blur\r\nthe borderline between advice and decision-making.\r\nThat would be an undesirable feature that would tend\r\nto undermine the time-tested characteristics of the\r\nUnited Nations system, namely, neutrality,\r\nresponsiveness, universality and impartiality.\r\nWe have taken note of the proposals made in the\r\narea of enhancing public information, and in particular\r\nof those for expanding educational outreach and\r\nimparting greater dynamism to the activities of the\r\nDepartment of Public Information. In principle, we\r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s proposal to create\r\nregional information hubs instead of the current pattern\r\nof United Nations information centres in Western\r\nEurope, where such centres drain away a large chunk\r\nof the resources of the Department. However, we\r\nwould like to study the implications of extending this\r\nto developing-country regions, where those centres\r\nhave been performing valuable services. We support\r\nother proposals of the Secretary-General to restructure\r\nthe Department and improve oversight of publications.\r\nGiven its activism, image and leadership, we have little\r\ndoubt that these initiatives will strengthen the\r\nDepartment’s overall effectiveness.\r\nThe proposals of the Secretary-General to\r\nstrengthen the effectiveness of the field-level presence\r\nin developing countries include joint programming and\r\npooling of resources. Such attempts have been made in\r\nthe past too, but not with considerable success. We\r\nhope that the current efforts will be more successful.\r\nThe Secretary-General plans to present a\r\ndocument within the next year clarifying roles and\r\nresponsibilities in the area of technical cooperation. He\r\nalso plans to establish a panel of eminent persons to\r\nreview the relationship between the United Nations and\r\ncivil society. In the case of the former, we trust that the\r\ndocument will not only clarify roles and\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nresponsibilities but also suggest ways and means of\r\nenhancing the technical capacity of the Secretariat\r\nunits responsible for technical cooperation and identify\r\nthe needs in this area as well as means of achieving\r\nthem. Similarly, in the case of the panel on the United\r\nNations relationship with civil society, we hope that the\r\nterms of reference of the panel will be so drawn as to\r\npreserve the intergovernmental character of the\r\nOrganization and to clarify the responsibility that\r\nultimately devolves on Governments for the decisions\r\nmade at the United Nations and for their\r\nimplementation.\r\nAn area that requires much deeper consideration\r\nand further thought is that of the new planning and\r\nbudget system that the Secretary-General has proposed.\r\nThe measures outlined by the Secretary-General for a\r\nmedium-term plan that is co-terminus with the budget\r\nperiod might well be a workable proposition, but it\r\nclearly needs more careful and detailed analysis.\r\nThe Secretary-General appears to advocate the\r\nabolition of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination, without giving us any alternatives by\r\nwhich the mandate of the Committee could be\r\nredesigned so as to respond to contemporary needs and\r\nrealities. The Secretary-General has asked for\r\nflexibility to reallocate resources between programmes\r\nand between allocations for personnel and other\r\nallocations by up to 10 per cent within a single\r\nbudgetary period. Even within national systems of\r\nGovernment, it is doubtful whether such wide latitude\r\nand flexibility would be permitted by the ministries of\r\nfinance to line ministries to reallocate resources\r\nbetween budget lines by up to 10 per cent within a\r\nsingle budgetary period. This is an area whose\r\nimplications require careful consideration. We are also\r\nconcerned that high levels of reallocation without\r\nreference to, and the approval of, intergovernmental\r\nbodies would have the potential to distort\r\nintergovernmental mandates. Once again, developing\r\ncountries might end up as the losers.\r\nWe have taken note of the proposals made by the\r\nSecretary-General to enhance staff motivation and\r\nmobility across the United Nations system. We feel\r\nstrongly that the experience accumulated over the years\r\nby the Secretariat divisions in charge of human\r\nresources management, the International Civil Service\r\nCommission, the United Nations Administrative\r\nTribunal and similar bodies should be fully utilized\r\nwhen undertaking the tasks outlined in actions 25 to 35\r\nof the Secretary-General’s proposals.\r\nThose are some of my delegation’s preliminary\r\nviews on the reform proposals made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We look forward to working with other\r\ndelegations in the discussions and consultations that\r\nwill take place. In a larger sense, we agree with the\r\nperception, so forcefully brought out by the Deputy\r\nSecretary-General in a recent article, that the United\r\nNations as an Organization needs to provide\r\nmanagement and cooperation at the global level to\r\naddress the broader issues confronting the world —\r\nissues that transcend borders. Addressing that\r\nchallenge calls for three broad initiatives involving the\r\nneed for legitimacy, the development of instruments\r\nand institutions that can make connections among a\r\nvast array of complex and interrelated issues, and\r\npassing the test of effectiveness. What is required is the\r\nright balance between universal institutions and\r\neffective ones. India agrees that if the United Nations\r\nsystem has to be a crucial part of solving the world’s\r\nproblems, it must be provided with adequate authority\r\nand resources. The Assembly should be in a position to\r\ngive clear guidance to the Secretary-General so that the\r\nprocess of reform can be taken forward. I wish to\r\npledge the full support of the Indian delegation in\r\nensuring the success of such an exercise.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): Brazil\r\naligns itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Venezuela on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China.\r\nMaking the Organization a more effective\r\ninstrument to achieve our priorities is a common goal\r\nof the Member States of the United Nations. In that\r\nregard, the Secretary-General’s proposal is very\r\nwelcome in our collective effort to proceed with a\r\nreform process that will enable the United Nations to\r\nwork more effectively. Allow me to congratulate him\r\non holding open-ended informal consultations on 24\r\nOctober, where it was possible to begin an exchange of\r\nideas between Member States and the Secretariat.\r\nIn broad terms, the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral can be divided in three categories. The first\r\nwould include initiatives that can be developed by the\r\nSecretariat without the explicit authorization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Secretary-General could\r\nproceed with the implementation of those measures,\r\nwithout running the risk of Member States indicating\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nhow the plans need to be modified in the event that\r\nchanges materialize that do not result in the anticipated\r\nbetter functioning of the Organization.\r\nThe second category of proposals is characterized\r\nby the request for the elaboration of studies that\r\npropose ways of strengthening the performance\r\ncapacity of the United Nations. The majority of\r\nproposals related to strengthening the Organization in\r\nthe area of human rights fall into that category. The\r\nsame is the case with proposals related to actions 2\r\nthrough 5, which requested the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights to hold\r\nconsultations on drafting reports and plans with treaty\r\norgans and directly with Member States of the\r\nOrganization. That would not allow for deeper analysis\r\nof the proposals related to that item. It would be logical\r\nthat those proposals be reconsidered by the Member\r\nStates of the Organization when the studies are ready.\r\nThe third category of proposals is related to what\r\nwas called a recommendation in the previous report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on the reform of the\r\nOrganization. In order to proceed with measures related\r\nto those proposals, explicit mandates of the General\r\nAssembly will be necessary to authorize the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to proceed. Generally, additional time and\r\nclarity will be needed so that the majority of Member\r\nStates can properly consider and assess the effects of\r\nsuch measures. To that end, it will be necessary to\r\nmaintain an ongoing dialogue between Member States\r\nand the Secretariat.\r\nThe majority of the measures related to reform in\r\nthe Organization’s budget also fall into that category.\r\nEven though we agree with the Secretary-General with\r\nregard to the need to simplify the budgetary process\r\nand the drafting of the medium-term plan, as well as\r\nwith regard to the need for a stricter system of\r\nevaluation and control of United Nations expenditures,\r\nwe are not convinced that the proposed measures, such\r\nas reducing the medium-term plan by half or\r\neliminating the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination, represent the most convenient route for\r\nthe ongoing search to achieve those objectives. Those\r\nmatters must be examined more closely.\r\nA final point, which I must address, is the reform\r\nof the Security Council. The Secretary-General has\r\ndevoted barely three paragraphs of his report to that\r\nitem, which are found at the beginning of his report.\r\nHowever, he approaches the question categorically,\r\nstating in paragraph 20 of his report (A/57/387): “No\r\nreform of the United Nations would be complete\r\nwithout reform of the Security Council”. I will not go\r\non at great length about my country’s position on the\r\nreform of the Council, which is broadly known.\r\nNonetheless, it seems to me necessary to emphasize the\r\ncoincidence of impressions, both on the part of\r\nMember States and on the part of the Secretariat, that\r\nexist regarding the importance of the item. In that\r\nregard, convinced that the Assembly will devote to the\r\nprocess the attention it requires, I reiterate that\r\nprogress in the discussions on the reform of the\r\nCouncil will depend substantially on the orientation\r\nthat the presidency of the General Assembly will be\r\nable to provide it.\r\nIn the consultations held on 24 October, the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General underscored the strategic\r\ncharacter and the condition of the agenda for changes\r\nas main principles of the document entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change”. While recognizing the need to give\r\ngreater detail regarding some of the ongoing measures\r\nof the report, she indicated that what is expected in that\r\nfirst stage of appraisal is to be able to rely on the\r\nreactions and guidance of Member States. Accordingly,\r\nI will proceed cautiously in presenting specific\r\nproposals regarding the measures considered in the\r\ndocument, limiting myself to assuring the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that he can count on the active participation\r\nand support of the Brazilian delegation in the debate\r\nand the decisions related to proposed reforms.\r\nAs you, Sir, have already stated, the continued\r\ndialogue on reform proposals must continue to be held\r\nin unofficial consultations, among all Member States.\r\nIn order to guarantee that those consultations have the\r\nproductive character that we hope will be reflected in\r\nthe final outcome of that process, allow me to conclude\r\nby reinforcing the suggestion that future consultations\r\non the report be organized on the basis of thematic\r\nseparation of the measures contained in the document.\r\nMrs. Loemban Tobing-Klein (Suriname): The\r\ninternational community needs a strong multilateral\r\ninstitution to address contemporary global issues in this\r\nera of globalization. This body, the United Nations,\r\nstill proves to be the best forum for dealing with the\r\nchallenges facing us in today’s world. To efficiently\r\noperate in this dynamic process of current international\r\nrelations, reforms to strengthen the Organization are\r\nessential.\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nWe, therefore, welcome this initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General to look once again into the issue of\r\nUnited Nations reform through an agenda for further\r\nchange. We congratulate the Secretary-General on his\r\nexcellent report, which deals with strengthening the\r\nUnited Nations, doing what matters, serving Member\r\nStates better, working better together, allocating\r\nresources to priorities, investing in excellence and\r\nmanaging change.\r\nThe reforms outlined in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport would lead to a more effective United Nations\r\nthat would be better able to assist us in reaching the\r\npivotal Millennium Development Goals. At the\r\nnational level, my Government is working towards\r\nachieving those goals by, first and foremost,\r\nincorporating that set of priorities into national\r\npolicies.\r\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General\r\nacknowledged the importance of reform of the General\r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council. We absolutely agree that “The\r\npromotion and protection of human rights is a bedrock\r\nrequirement for the realization of the Charter’s vision\r\nof a just and peaceful world” (A/57/387, para. 45). We\r\ntherefore applaud the work being done by the United\r\nNations in this field, as well as the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals for intensifying United Nations efforts in the\r\narea of human rights.\r\nIn this regard we have to stress that every human\r\nbeing has the right to development. This right is\r\nenshrined in the Declaration on the Right to\r\nDevelopment, adopted by the General Assembly in\r\nresolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986. Development\r\nand respect for human rights are interdependent.\r\nWe agree fully that the very valuable report of the\r\nSecretary-General entitled “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”, pays\r\nspecial attention to human rights and its\r\ninterrelationship to development. My delegation is\r\nextremely satisfied with this rights-based approach and\r\nwishes to thank the Secretary-General for pursuing it.\r\nIn this respect we also wish to stress the importance of\r\nhuman rights education as a key to development.\r\nThe right to development has been reaffirmed as a\r\nuniversal and inalienable right and as an integral part\r\nof fundamental human rights during the World\r\nConference on Human Rights, held in Vienna in 1993.\r\nAll the proposed changes, improvements and\r\nefforts at streamlining contained in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report are focusing on the people of the\r\nworld; they are aimed at making the life of the people\r\nbetter and more rewarding, at meeting development\r\ngoals and at making the United Nations a more\r\neffective instrument in the service of the world’s\r\npeople, as the Secretary-General stated at the opening\r\nof the debate on his report yesterday morning.\r\nImprovements in the Department of Public\r\nInformation; a focus on the quality, rather than the\r\nquantity of United Nations reports and conferences;\r\nstrengthening partnerships with civil society and the\r\nprivate sector; allocating resources to priorities, and\r\ninvesting in the workforce of the United Nations are all\r\nareas where we anticipate change. We are especially\r\npleased by the fact that the Secretary-General has\r\nacknowledged the difficulties facing smaller nations\r\nlike my own, in playing a meaningful role in United\r\nNations activities, because of difficulties in keeping\r\ntrack of and participating in the vast amount of annual\r\nmeetings.\r\nSuriname was privileged to chair the meeting of\r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean Group during the\r\nmonth of September, when the Secretary-General,\r\nbriefing the Group on his current report, said the\r\nmeeting was the first in a series he intended to have\r\nwith regional groups. He requested guidance from\r\nMember countries, as well as technical advice from\r\nvarious committees.\r\nMy delegation noted with appreciation that the\r\nSecretary-General stressed during this important\r\nbriefing several priority subjects, including, the\r\npromotion and protection of human rights and more\r\nassistance from Member States in this area; the need\r\nfor the United Nations to respond to the requirements\r\nof the international community and to move forward at\r\na faster pace and at a higher level; the need to better\r\nallocate resources to priority areas; improved United\r\nNations interaction with civil society; the\r\nOrganization’s responsibility regarding African-related\r\naffairs; the streamlining of vital functions of the United\r\nNations; better coordination in the social and economic\r\narea, especially in developing countries; improved\r\nservice to the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, as well as to Member States in general;\r\nrealignment of the United Nations priorities to coincide\r\nwith the aims of the Millennium Declaration, as well as\r\nrecently held summits and conferences;\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.40\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals;\r\nand increased focus on information and communication\r\ntechnology.\r\nIf we, as Member States, privileged as we are to\r\nbelong to this important family of nations with so many\r\ngreat developmental potentials, can succeed in joining\r\nhands to realize the essential goals of this important\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, we can live up to the\r\nnoble values, principles and goals enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, namely respect for\r\nhuman rights, human dignity, equality, tolerance,\r\npeace, national and international security and social\r\nand economic progress.\r\nThe Government of Suriname is grateful for the\r\ncontinuous, serious and strong efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to improve the lives of the people on this\r\nplanet; we fully support the Secretary-General in his\r\nendeavours to strengthen our Organization; we look\r\nforward to a continuously improving United Nations\r\nand we are ready to contribute where and when\r\npossible.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
