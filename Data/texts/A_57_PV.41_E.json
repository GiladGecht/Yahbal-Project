(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Ms. Jarbussynova\r\n(Kazakhstan), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 52 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/387 and\r\nA/57/387/Corr.1)\r\nMr. Dos Santos (Mozambique): The delegation\r\nof the Republic of Mozambique feels honoured to be\r\npart of this Assembly, in which United Nations\r\nMember States are debating an agenda for further\r\nchange, with a view to strengthening the United\r\nNations system. We thank the Secretary-General for\r\nintroducing his report (A/57/387 and Corr.1). My\r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statements made by\r\nVenezuela on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, by\r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nand the African Union, and by Egypt on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group.\r\nMy delegation has carefully reviewed the report\r\nof the Secretary-General and considers it a very useful\r\ntool in the current efforts to improve the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations system. The report\r\ncontains good proposals that deserve our full attention.\r\nWe welcome those proposals for further pursuing the\r\nagenda for change and pledge our full support to the\r\nSecretary-General in this daunting task, which requires\r\nthe collective wisdom and responsibility of the United\r\nNations family.\r\nAs stated by the Chairman of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina, the far-reaching proposals advanced in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General require more time for\r\nconsideration, including further, detailed clarification\r\nof their nature and scope, as well as an extensive\r\ndebate within the United Nations family. In that regard,\r\nwe welcome the President’s intention to hold\r\nconsultations on the report. Nevertheless, my\r\ndelegation would like to share its preliminary views on\r\nthe report, in the hope that they will contribute to\r\ndeepening the debate that we have just initiated on this\r\nmatter.\r\nMy delegation has been following closely the\r\nreform process under way since 1997. Reform has\r\ncontributed towards positioning the United Nations\r\nsystem at the forefront of international action to tackle\r\nglobal challenges. The reforms undertaken thus far,\r\nmainly targeting the internal structures and culture of\r\nthe United Nations, have improved coherence,\r\nefficiency, openness and creativity within the United\r\nNations system.\r\nNow, we need to address the ultimate goals of the\r\nreform: ensuring that the Organization devotes its\r\nattention to the priorities agreed upon by Member\r\nStates and that the Secretariat delivers better service.\r\nThat requires a wide-ranging reform process that also\r\nneeds to target the institutional framework of the\r\nUnited Nations system, including, inter alia, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council,\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nthe Security Council and the programme of work of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nMy delegation believes that aligning the activities\r\nof the United Nations system and the priorities defined\r\nby Member States should be based on a common policy\r\nframework drawn from the Millennium Declaration,\r\nthe outcome documents of major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits — such as those on financing\r\nfor development, sustainable development, the least\r\ndeveloped countries, HIV/AIDS, children, small arms,\r\nracism, women, social development and human\r\nsettlements — and other legislative mandates contained\r\nin relevant General Assembly and Security Council\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe common policy framework for the entire\r\nUnited Nations system should provide clear\r\nbenchmarks related to the full implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, as well as other goals\r\nand targets envisaged in the relevant documents used to\r\ninform the drafting of the framework. The policy\r\nframework should also recognize the special,\r\npreferential treatment that Africa and least developed\r\ncountries should be accorded when we are prioritizing\r\nUnited Nations activities, as agreed upon in various\r\nmeetings and documents.\r\nThe common policy framework to be debated and\r\nagreed upon by consensus, as well as the revised\r\nprogramme budget drafted on the basis of that\r\nframework, should be forward-looking, action-oriented\r\nand results-based. But, ultimately, it should once and\r\nfor all align activities with agreed priorities, including\r\nby allocating the necessary resources for the relevant\r\nactivities. Resources should be allocated to the areas\r\nwhere they are most needed and where they can make a\r\nreal difference. We should avoid the current trend of\r\nallocating resources based on political agendas alien to\r\nthe United Nations objectives, which has proved to be\r\ncost ineffective and wasteful. The recommendations\r\nput forward in the Secretary-General’s report attempt\r\nto deal with some of those issues.\r\nIn this reform process, Africa should indeed be\r\naccorded special attention. We welcome the proposal\r\nby the Secretary-General to enhance the mandate of the\r\nAdviser for Special Assignments in Africa as a step in\r\nthe right direction. Although at this stage there is no\r\nclarity on the specific mandate, we believe that a focus\r\non the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) would be in order, consistent with the\r\nrecently adopted General Assembly resolution on\r\nNEPAD resolution 57/2. We also hope that this\r\narrangement will be of a permanent nature and that the\r\nAdviser will report directly to the Secretary-General to\r\nensure the necessary political guidance and impact.\r\nAt the same time, it is crucial that the office of\r\nthe Adviser be adequately staffed and resourced. We\r\nfurther suggest that the Adviser work closely with the\r\nOffice of the Special Coordinator for Africa and the\r\nLeast Developed Countries and the Office of the High\r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries,\r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island\r\nDeveloping States as most African countries fall into\r\nthe category of least developed countries. Mandates\r\ncould thus be streamlined and cooperation ensured.\r\nPrioritization of activities and resources should\r\nalso be extended to the United Nations presence at the\r\ncountry level. We believe that the United Nations\r\nshould focus both on countries emerging from conflicts\r\nand on those involved in development activities.\r\nThe common policy framework should also be\r\ntranslated into the United Nations country offices\r\nthrough the mainstreaming into national development\r\nstrategies of the Millennium Development Goals and\r\nother goals and targets that will form part of the policy\r\nframework. United Nations country offices should be\r\nfurther improved and strengthened to ensure that they\r\nplay a major role in advocacy, implementation and\r\npolicy advice to countries in need. Therefore, United\r\nNations country offices should be adequately\r\nresourced, especially financially and in terms of staff,\r\nin order to fulfil the important tasks at hand. This\r\nrequires the additional and predictable resources,\r\nparticularly core resources, that are so critical to\r\ndevelopment projects in Africa and in least developed\r\ncountries in general.\r\nWe welcome the proposal by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to prepare a document clarifying roles and\r\nresponsibilities in the area of technical cooperation.\r\nThat would definitely address the current duplication,\r\ncompetition and overlaps that are common at the\r\ncountry level, and would thereby contribute to making\r\nsavings and to minimizing potential waste of resources.\r\nMy delegation supports closer interaction\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society, as well as\r\npartnerships with the private sector. We believe that\r\npromoting such partnerships would certainly result in\r\nadded value to the organization. In this process, we\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nmust ensure that participation by civil society\r\norganizations in the affairs of the United Nations is\r\ndone in a fair and balanced manner, in which civil\r\nsociety organizations of developing countries have a\r\nmeaningful role to play. In that connection, we support\r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal to establish a panel of\r\neminent persons to review the relationship between the\r\nUnited Nations and civil society.\r\nThe Republic of Mozambique is broadly\r\nsupportive of the Secretary-General’s proposals to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of the United Nations and\r\nstreamline the budgetary and administrative activities\r\nof the Organization. We support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to prepare a revised programme\r\nbudget for 2004-2005, based on the priorities of the\r\nOrganization: a common policy framework for the\r\nentire United Nations system drawn from the\r\nMillennium Declaration, outcome documents of major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, and other\r\nlegislative mandates adopted by the General Assembly\r\nand the Security Council.\r\nWe took note of the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposals on enhancing staff mobility across the United\r\nNations system. In our view, mobility, together with\r\nbest quality in staffing, should be geared towards\r\nensuring the right staff for the required job. We\r\nreaffirm resolution 55/258 as the cornerstone of human\r\nresources management at the United Nations. In\r\nparticular, we reaffirm our principled position on the\r\nneed to ensure equitable geographical representation\r\nand gender balance in the United Nations staff.\r\nTherefore, we urge the Secretary-General to fulfil the\r\nrelevant provisions of resolution 55/258, including\r\npresenting a programme with specific targets on the\r\nrecruitment of nationals from unrepresented and\r\nunderrepresented countries.\r\nThe reform process we are engaged in can be\r\nsuccessful only if all members of the United Nations\r\nfamily show the necessary political will and shoulder\r\ntheir collective responsibility. As we reach the most\r\ncritical part of the reform process, the sense of\r\ncommitment should be stepped up. The Assembly can\r\nrest assured of the commitment and cooperation of the\r\nRepublic of Mozambique in that regard.\r\nMr. Jacob (Israel): Seeing that I have the\r\nprivilege of being the forty-seventh speaker on this\r\nagenda item, I will endeavour to keep my statement\r\nbrief. The report before us, “Strengthening the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change” (A/57/387), is\r\nnothing less than extraordinary. It is concise, candid\r\nand constructive. It is a work that embodies the spirit\r\nof the agenda itself, and it calls for “fewer reports that\r\nare richer in content and shorter in length” (para. 27).\r\nI would like to comment on four specific aspects\r\nof the Secretary-General’s report that are of particular\r\ninterest to my delegation. First, regarding the work of\r\nthis very body, the General Assembly, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral suggests the combining of duplicative\r\ndiscussions and the reduction of recurring agenda\r\nitems. My delegation has frequently lamented the\r\nautomatic annual rehash of resolutions without regard\r\nfor the relevance of their content or the efficiency of\r\ntheir treatment. A reduction in the number of\r\noverlapping resolutions can be achieved by simply\r\nmerging and editing texts, thus creating important\r\nsavings in time, money and paperwork. The pattern of\r\nrecurring agenda items is particularly annoying and\r\nwasteful. We support the Secretary-General’s call for a\r\nrigorous review of this practice and his suggestion that\r\nmany issues no longer be addressed annually.\r\nSecondly, I note the Secretary-General’s call for\r\nrealigned priorities, including a focus on technology-\r\nbased development solutions, water issues, the\r\npromotion of good governance as the foundation for\r\npeace, and the strengthening of the United Nations\r\ncapacity to fight terrorism. Those goals seem to my\r\ndelegation to be right on target. From our perspective,\r\nthose four priorities constitute the building blocks for\r\nregional reconciliation and provide a promise of\r\ncooperation, development and prosperity for all peace-\r\nloving peoples.\r\nThirdly, in his report, the Secretary-General\r\nobserves that “The Department of Public Information\r\nhas suffered from a fragmentation of its efforts as a\r\nresult of too many mandates and missions” (para. 60).\r\nOur delegation could not agree more with that\r\nstatement. The valuable resources of this Organization\r\nhave been squandered on unnecessary and partial\r\ninformation efforts, perpetuated by partisan political\r\nperspectives. The new operating model of the\r\nDepartment proposed by the Secretary-General should\r\nresolve that wasteful and counterproductive\r\nphenomenon.\r\nLastly, the Secretary-General calls for the\r\nestablishment of a panel to review the relationship\r\nbetween the United Nations and civil society and to\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\noffer practical recommendations for approved\r\nmodalities of interaction. The effort to bring about\r\nimproved engagement with civil society based on\r\nprocedures and policies that reflect greater coherence,\r\nconsistency and predictability is indeed welcome. The\r\nterms and conditions governing the accreditation and\r\nparticipation of non-governmental organizations in\r\nUnited Nations conferences should indeed be reviewed\r\nand improved in order to, among other things, protect\r\nthe focus of the Organization from being appropriated\r\nby hidden agendas.\r\nIn conclusion, we both welcome and endorse the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General. We stand ready to\r\nassist in the efforts to turn that vision into a reality.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI wish to thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor the submission of his report, “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387 and Corr.1). Mexico welcomes this new\r\neffort by the Secretary-General to reform the\r\nOrganization so that it can face effectively the\r\nchallenges and the opportunities presented to us by the\r\nnew millennium. We believe that the report before us\r\ntoday for consideration not only is timely and\r\nnecessary, but also encompasses spheres that go\r\nbeyond the field of administration and thus require a\r\nrenewed commitment by all Member States to\r\nmultilateralism. This is a matter of strengthening the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to act to promote peace\r\nand development.\r\nIn that context, I should like, first of all, to\r\ncommit the delegation of Mexico to working together\r\nwith the Secretary-General and with the President of\r\nthe General Assembly in the process of building the\r\nconsensus that this exercise requires. We shall maintain\r\nhigh-level participation in the deliberations and\r\nnegotiations that are to follow this debate, and we shall\r\nalways seek to place the general interest above\r\nindividual considerations.\r\nFive years ago, the United Nations began a\r\nprocess of profound and necessary transformation that\r\nhas not been completed and that now includes areas\r\nunimagined in 1997. We have moved from structural\r\nreform of the Secretariat to reviewing the working\r\nmethods of the Organization and of the\r\nintergovernmental organs that constitute it. That\r\nrequires a set of actions, not only by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral but also, and above all, by Member States. It is\r\nthe duty of all Member States to review the\r\nOrganization’s priorities and to provide the general\r\nguidance that enables the United Nations to pursue its\r\nprinciples and purposes in a new international context\r\nthat is always changing.\r\nWe must develop a new strategic vision that\r\nincorporates new actors and realities so that our action\r\ncontinues to be relevant and so that we can have a\r\nconstructive impact on international events. That\r\nmeans abandoning certain obsolete parliamentary\r\npractices and reaffirming confidence in the system and\r\nin the need for balanced and complementary action\r\namong the principal organs of the Organization.\r\nWe view the proposals contained in the report as\r\npart of a set of actions to be taken not only by the\r\nSecretariat but also by the other principal organs of the\r\nUnited Nations in order to make progress in a process\r\nof broad and sustained reform. We appreciate the\r\nfrankness and the clarity with which the report of the\r\nSecretary-General presents the current situation with\r\nregard to certain aspects of the Organization. That\r\nfocus helps us to identify strengths and weaknesses.\r\nIt is clear that the full implementation of the\r\nmeasures proposed by the Secretary-General will\r\nrequire broad consultation and the political will of\r\nMember States. There are various possibilities to put\r\nforth in our discussions. Accordingly, we support the\r\nproposal to create a high-level open-ended group that\r\nwould work informally. We must ensure that the\r\nprocess is given genuine impetus from the highest level\r\nof our delegations. In any case, we must quickly clarify\r\nthe nature of the process and the timetable for our\r\nfuture discussions. We must not miss the opportunity to\r\nadopt the necessary relevant decisions, and to adopt\r\nthem now.\r\nThere are certain specific aspects on which we\r\nshould like to comment. With regard to the budget, we\r\nbelieve that the Organization has made important\r\nprogress with respect to planning, transparency,\r\naccountability and financial discipline. In addition, we\r\nnote with satisfaction a greater rationalization of the\r\nwork of the Organization and a better use of the\r\navailable resources.\r\nMexico agrees with the view of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, expressed in action 1 of his report, that the\r\npriorities of the Millennium Declaration should be\r\nbetter reflected in the programme budget. However, my\r\ndelegation is concerned about the possibility that in\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nthat exercise, certain priorities, such as disarmament\r\nand drug control, might be put aside even though they\r\nare fully reflected in the medium-term plan. Therefore,\r\nmy delegation is interested in knowing how that\r\nproposal will be implemented, since the delicate\r\nbalance of priorities established in the medium-term\r\nplan must not be altered.\r\nMy delegation also believes that we must discuss\r\nin depth action 21 (d), which would give the Secretary-\r\nGeneral a certain level of budgetary discretion. The\r\ntwo criteria that, in our opinion, should guide the\r\ndiscussions on this subject are confidence in the\r\nSecretariat and, secondly, the need for oversight\r\nmechanisms that clearly specify frames of reference\r\nwithin which the Secretary-General can make use of\r\nsuch capacities.\r\nMexico accords high priority to the subject of\r\nhuman rights and generally agrees with the report’s\r\nproposals in that regard. We believe that strengthening\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Human Rights is very important. My delegation\r\nawaits with great interest the report and the plans to be\r\nformulated in order to implement actions 2 to 5 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nLastly, my delegation believes that human\r\nresources are the most valuable asset of countries and\r\ninstitutions. We understand the concern of the\r\nSecretary-General that the United Nations should be an\r\nattractive option for those who work here. We are\r\naware that instituting modern working methods will\r\nrequire greater flexibility. We believe, however, that\r\nthe new culture of work proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should include accountability as one of its\r\ncentral priorities.\r\nWe reiterate our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his valuable proposals. They are clearly\r\ndirected towards ensuring that our Organization is\r\nmore effective and that it has a clearer approach with\r\nrespect to priorities. My delegation will work with the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly and with the\r\nSecretary-General to attain those objectives.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): We welcome the fact that Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan has begun his second term of office by\r\nsubmitting proposals aimed at ensuring that the United\r\nNations focuses its efforts on implementing the\r\npriorities set out at a number of conferences. My\r\ncountry has already expressed its views regarding the\r\nchanges and reforms proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in document A/57/387. Before making several\r\nfurther comments, I should like to stress that my\r\ncountry fully supports the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Venezuela on behalf of the Group of\r\n77 and China, the statement by the representative of\r\nSouth Africa, speaking on behalf of the African Union,\r\nand the statement made by the representative of Egypt\r\non behalf of the African Group.\r\nThe Charter sets out all the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and its principal\r\norgans. Those organs have done a great deal of work\r\nand achieved much over the years, and the Millennium\r\nDeclaration represents a further step forward in this\r\nrespect despite many unexpected challenges. However,\r\nwe want to ensure that the United Nations is even\r\nstronger than in the past, so it is essential and urgent\r\nthat we make its bodies more effective. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be commended for having taken this\r\nnew initiative in response to the wishes expressed two\r\nyears ago by our heads of State or Government, who\r\nmade clear their resolve to make our Organization\r\nmore effective in attaining its declared goals.\r\nWe note that there is a need to strengthen the role\r\nof the General Assembly; that is the task that we have\r\nset ourselves. This year, Member States elected the\r\nPresident and the Vice-Presidents of the Assembly and\r\nthe chairpersons of the Main Committees three months\r\nbefore the beginning of the regular session. That\r\nrepresents important progress, but we believe that\r\nfurther changes need to be made. A number of United\r\nNations resolutions remain dead letters, which is no\r\nlonger acceptable. We must endeavour to distinguish\r\nbetween successes and failures and how to deal with\r\nthe causes of such failures. We must be candid lest we\r\ncreate the impression that the General Assembly is\r\nmerely a forum in which people lament certain\r\nsituations or praise certain things, but where nobody\r\nreally listens.\r\nThe Secretary-General was right to call upon the\r\nGeneral Assembly to streamline its agenda. We support\r\nthe idea that a number of items should be studied on a\r\nbiennial basis. We would also like to endorse the\r\npractice employed at this session of clustering certain\r\nitems and considering them jointly. We do not,\r\nhowever, believe that other items that have been on the\r\nagenda for years should be eliminated. We believe that\r\nit really depends on the decisions taken under those\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nitems: if they have not been implemented, they can be\r\ndeleted.\r\nThe Secretary-General has said that United\r\nNations reform must be accompanied by reform of the\r\nSecurity Council. This is a very important issue. We\r\nmust demonstrate the necessary political will to resolve\r\nthe stalemate in that area in order to facilitate the\r\nreform of the Security Council so that it can become\r\ntruly representative of all States.\r\nMy delegation supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nstatement that Security Council reform cannot be\r\nconfined to an increase in the membership but that\r\nthere must also be an improvement in the Council’s\r\nworking methods. We have made some progress in that\r\narea, but not enough. We must improve its working\r\nmethods and address the shortcomings in that respect.\r\nThe most recent changes in the Council’s work must be\r\ninstitutionalized.\r\nThe Secretary-General states that the Security\r\nCouncil must turn to the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council to help it address issues\r\nand problems. Member States should also make an\r\neffort to promote the work of the Security Council and\r\nincrease its contacts with other bodies, such as the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, as well as with regional\r\norganizations and arrangements. It must be more\r\ntransparent in its work, more neutral and more\r\nobjective. It should not operate according to a policy of\r\ndouble standards. We need to make good on these\r\nshortcomings, which have a very unfortunate impact on\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Secretary-General has described areas that he\r\nwants to be reinforced. Many meetings were held last\r\nyear, but a number of countries were not able to\r\nparticipate effectively in them. We recognize the need\r\nto increase international awareness in this regard, and\r\nwe call upon all Member States to show discipline and\r\nto refrain from calling for the convening of\r\nconferences, apart from high-level conferences that\r\ndiscuss new questions.\r\nWe fully agree that we should not produce\r\nunnecessary reports. Reports should be shorter, their\r\ncontent should be better and they must be transparent\r\nand must reflect the outcome of consultations held with\r\nthe countries concerned. We should eliminate the\r\nproblems associated with drafting consolidated reports\r\nwith the countries concerned. Countries should submit\r\ntheir reports in good time, and they should be available\r\nin the official languages.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report refers to adapting\r\nthe work programme of the United Nations to tailor it\r\nto the Millennium Declaration goals. We support his\r\ncomments with regard to delving more deeply into the\r\ncauses of conflict in the face of military threats. This\r\nshould become a priority for the Organization. We\r\nbelieve that in this respect it is important to increase\r\nsupport for the international campaign to eliminate\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nBut we should not simply provide advice to\r\ncountries so that they can strengthen their legislative\r\nand administrative frameworks in order to combat\r\nterrorism. There is a need to study the causes of\r\nterrorism, too, to define it and to remedy the situation\r\nin the context of a global vision, bearing in mind the\r\ninterests, concerns and security of all.\r\nThere are now so many United Nations bodies\r\nestablished under human rights conventions that\r\nperiodic reports also have proliferated and cast heavy\r\nburdens on all countries, especially developing\r\ncountries. We believe, however, that each State needs\r\nto submit a consolidated report within the context of\r\nthe various United Nations bodies. We need to\r\neliminate duplication in order to relieve the resultant\r\nfinancial and human burden. We hope that this goal can\r\nbe achieved, in keeping with the recommendations\r\nsubmitted by the High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights. We believe that the issue of human rights is a\r\nvery important and sensitive one, and we need to show\r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, as well as\r\nrespect for the various cultures and their beliefs.\r\nWe very much support the role of the United\r\nNations in helping Africa to face the numerous\r\nchallenges confronting it. We are pleased that the\r\nSecretary-General has reiterated that Africa is one of\r\nthe prime concerns of the United Nations. The\r\nOrganization must continue to work to ensure that the\r\nAfrican continent is given its rightful place, so that\r\nAfrican countries can reap the fruit of their national\r\nefforts.\r\nThe cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe international community has developed over the\r\nyears, but we see in the report of the Secretary-General\r\nthat it leaves something to be desired. We support the\r\nintergovernmental nature of the United Nations, but\r\nsome aspects need to be dealt with by the high-level\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\npanel that the Secretary-General is seeking to establish.\r\nWe hope that rules will be established guaranteeing the\r\nparticipation of all, in particular the non-governmental\r\norganizations of the developing countries. As the\r\nSecretary-General has said, the number of these\r\norganizations is very small compared to those in the\r\nindustrialized countries.\r\nThe Secretary-General is also proposing a number\r\nof actions to try to simplify the submission of the\r\nbudget and the budget outline. We believe that a\r\nmedium-term plan spanning only two years would\r\ncover too short a period, so we do not think that it\r\nshould be reduced.\r\nWe believe that United Nations officials, who hail\r\nfrom so many regions, have vast potential to offer. We\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s quest to recruit\r\nnationals of countries that are under-represented or not\r\nrepresented at all. We believe that officials should be\r\nrecruited who are willing to devote their lives to this\r\nOrganization and work anywhere in the world. Of\r\ncourse, this should not affect the recruitment of new\r\nstaff members who might meet the needs of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn conclusion, the Secretary-General should take\r\nsteps that are in keeping with the suggestions contained\r\nin the report. Reforms have been suggested by the\r\nSecretary-General, but it is up to Member States to\r\ndecide on them. We wish to reiterate that the delegation\r\nof my country will participate positively in this\r\nprocess, and we assure the President of our\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): My delegation supports the\r\nstatement made by the representative of Venezuela on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China earlier in this\r\ndebate. The Jamaican delegation would like to add a\r\nfew comments of its own, having studied the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General on “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change”. We regard the\r\nproposals contained therein as important initiatives for\r\nreform, and we support their objectives.\r\nThe report builds on a process begun in 1997 and\r\nproposes adjustments to increase efficiency in the\r\nSecretariat’s operations. We congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his vision of modernization, which is aimed\r\nat increasing efficiency in administrative arrangements\r\nin order to deliver improved service to Member States.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals, as well as\r\nthe outcomes of the global conferences held over the\r\npast decade, have set new priorities aimed, inter alia, at\r\nachieving economic and social development as well as\r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts, and at confronting\r\nemerging new threats to international security. We\r\nagree that it is obviously necessary for the United\r\nNations to align its programmes to meet the needs and\r\npriorities of the time. Jamaica therefore supports the\r\nproposal for action 1, which intends to bring the\r\nprogramme budget in line with the priorities agreed in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe are also favourably disposed towards the\r\nproposal for a shorter, more strategic medium-term\r\nplan covering two years rather than four. We believe\r\nthat this would be better geared towards allowing\r\npragmatic adjustments within a shorter budget cycle.\r\nWith regard to human rights, Jamaica concurs\r\nthat the United Nations has an important role to play in\r\nstrengthening human rights. We note the progress made\r\nin promoting human rights norms and practices and in\r\nsupporting human rights at the country level. We\r\ntherefore support the proposal to streamline the\r\nmachinery within the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. This should\r\nresult in better and more cooperative arrangements\r\nbetween the Office and Governments and in a\r\nreduction in the current onerous levels of reporting\r\nrequirements.\r\nWe also support the strengthening of the delivery\r\nof public information on United Nations activities. We\r\ngenerally welcome the proposals for the repositioning\r\nof the Department of Public Information.\r\nWith regard to United Nations Information\r\nCentres, my delegation recognizes the important role\r\nplayed by these centres in disseminating information at\r\nthe country level. For developing countries, these\r\nCentres are a useful instrument for sensitizing people\r\nto the vital role of the United Nations and how it works\r\nfor them. We note that the report proposes the\r\nrationalization of these Centres around regional hubs,\r\nbeginning with Europe. We are mindful of the need to\r\nminimize the costs associated with maintaining the\r\nCentres, but we would caution that further plans to\r\nregionalize them should take into consideration the\r\nspecial needs of the regions affected.\r\nThe integration of United Nations libraries\r\nthrough the use of information technology is obviously\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nuseful in improving access to information. My\r\ndelegation supports measures that will bring about\r\nmore efficient systems. The creation of a multilingual\r\nelectronic gateway for accessing collections,\r\ndocuments and information is a positive step, but due\r\nconsideration must be given to countries which may\r\nnot have the technological capacity to access this\r\ninformation. We therefore believe that the delivery of\r\ninformation should be so constructed as to allow\r\ndeveloping countries with varying technological\r\ncapacities to be able to receive the service.\r\nThe streamlining of reports and the management\r\nof conferences and meetings are areas in which reform\r\nis needed. My delegation shares the view that there is\r\ntoo much duplication in the area of reports. Every\r\neffort should be made to reduce that duplication. We\r\nalso agree with the need to streamline reports in order\r\nto make them more consolidated and focused, as well\r\nas with the need to achieving some reduction in the\r\nvolume and frequency of reports, without sacrificing\r\nquality or comprehensiveness.\r\nImproving coordination among the component\r\nparts of the United Nations has proven to be an\r\neffective means of confronting challenges, especially\r\nthose faced by developing countries. Jamaica supports\r\nthe proposal to develop an implementation plan that\r\nincludes joint programming and the pooling of\r\ncommon resources in United Nations country offices.\r\nWe regard the delivery of technical cooperation to\r\ndeveloping countries as being of particular importance.\r\nIn that connection, we must express some concern\r\nabout the proposals mentioned in paragraphs 50 and\r\n51, concerning incorporating human rights into\r\noperational activities at the country level. Our concern\r\nis with the possible diversion of resources from\r\ntraditional areas of technical cooperation. We therefore\r\nlook forward to the report to be presented in September\r\n2003 and to a clarification of roles and responsibilities\r\nin the area of technical cooperation.\r\nAn important aspect of the new reforms is the\r\nsystem for allocating resources to priorities. The\r\nSecretary-General’s proposal for simplifying and\r\nshortening the planning and budget cycle appears to be\r\npractical and workable. A medium-term plan covering\r\ntwo years instead of four is better geared towards\r\nallowing for pragmatic adjustments to meet new\r\nrequirements and the needs of the times. There would\r\nalso obviously be a need for some modification of the\r\nrole of the Committee for Programme and\r\nCoordination, which would need some further\r\ndiscussion.\r\nJamaica supports the view that the impact and\r\nvitality of the Organization rests upon having a core of\r\ninternational civil servants who have dedicated their\r\ncareers to the service of the United Nations. The\r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive human resource\r\npolicy is therefore an essential part of ensuring that the\r\nUnited Nations attracts and maintains top-quality staff.\r\nIt is in this regard that we welcome the ongoing reform\r\nmeasures pertaining to human resource management\r\naimed at encouraging mobility, enlarging opportunities\r\nfor General Service staff, boosting staff morale and\r\nrejuvenating the Organization’s Secretariat.\r\nFinally, we look forward to participating in a\r\nprocess that will allow all Member States to be\r\ninvolved in reaching a consensus position on initiatives\r\nproposed in the Secretary-General’s report. The\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations is a process that\r\nmatters to all of us, and it should be organized and\r\nreformed so as to serve our common purposes.\r\nJamaica, as always, is ready to play its part.\r\nMr. Hussein (Ethiopia): At the outset, allow me\r\nonce again to express our pleasure at seeing you,\r\nMadam, presiding over this important agenda item\r\nbefore the General Assembly.\r\nI would also wish to thank Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for his report entitled “Strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387).\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\ndelivered by the representative of the Arab Republic of\r\nEgypt elaborating Africa’s non-paper on behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group.\r\nWe believe that the Secretary-General’s report is\r\ntimely. I say that because two years ago we adopted the\r\nMillennium Declaration and its Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. We believe that those Goals\r\nconstitute not only what should define the key\r\nobjective of the international community, but that they\r\nwill also serve as the standard by which our collective\r\nendeavours will be judged in a decade or so. Previous\r\nreviews of internationally agreed development goals\r\nhave left much to be desired, a problem that has been\r\nparticularly pronounced on the African continent. I\r\nwould also say that the report is timely in as far as the\r\npresent agenda to strengthen the United Nations needs\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nto be properly managed to improve the effectiveness of\r\nthe Organization with a view to more fully achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. In that context,\r\nwe welcome the Secretary-General’s intention to\r\nsubmit a thoroughly revised programme budget to the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 2003 that better reflects the\r\npriorities agreed at the Millennium Assembly.\r\nThe General Assembly is now considering the\r\nSecretary-General’s agenda for further change, at a\r\ntime when the Assembly has welcomed, and Member\r\nStates have expressed full support for, the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). In that\r\nregard, we welcome the Secretary-General’s decision\r\nto better coordinate the Secretariat’s support for the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in their consideration of Africa-related issues.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the development of an\r\nimplementation plan by the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Group to strengthen the effectiveness of\r\nthe Organization’s presence in developing countries. At\r\nthe same time, we would wish to encourage the Group\r\nto develop a plan for effective and increased\r\nmobilization of resources devoted to United Nations\r\noperational activities for development. My delegation\r\nis also open to consideration of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrequest for flexibility in reallocating resources between\r\nprogrammes, once, of course, issues of accountability\r\nand monitoring are clarified.\r\nWith regard to human resources issues, we fully\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s proposal for enhancing\r\nstaff mobility across the United Nations system. As one\r\nof several duty stations, Ethiopia stands ready to\r\nextend its full cooperation in this respect. We are also\r\nhappy to note the intentions of the Secretary-General to\r\nincrease opportunities for General Service staff. In this\r\ncontext, we support the request to raise the annual\r\nquota of professional posts available for successful\r\nGeneral Service examination candidates to 25 per cent.\r\nIn the area of public information we welcome Mr.\r\nAnnan’s measures for attempting to turn a fragmented\r\nand ineffective Department of Public Information into\r\none that is not defensive about the many positive\r\nactivities that the United Nations has carried out and is\r\ncurrently involved in. To have an impact, the\r\nDepartment should vigorously advocate for\r\nmultilateralism. What we see in many of the 71\r\ninformation centres around the world is that very little\r\ninformation is given out, to say nothing about the\r\nDepartment really making a case for the United\r\nNations. The Department is, in fact, today being\r\nattacked in many quarters. The Secretary General\r\nproposes\r\n“to rationalize the network of United Nations\r\ninformation centres around regional hubs, starting\r\nwith the creation of a Western European hub.”\r\n(A/57/387, action 8, para. 72)\r\nAt least in Europe, that would bring the 13\r\ncurrent information centres into one hub. Doing so\r\nwould be quite good, and we support it.\r\nMy delegation would also support giving special\r\nattention to specific countries — and I mean here\r\ncertain developed ones — where what the United\r\nNations stands for is under constant attack by some\r\nquarters in those countries. In those countries — I do\r\nnot need to mention any names, we know who they\r\nare — the United Nations has to come forward, through\r\nits Department of Public Information, and stand up for\r\nall the things this Organization has been advocating\r\nsince the end of the Second World War. This being the\r\nonly global multilateral organization, we should not\r\nshy away from defending it. The mouthpiece of the\r\nUnited Nations for doing that job is the Department of\r\nPublic Information. It is in that context that my\r\ndelegation supports the intention of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to reform that Department, which, in our view,\r\nhas been dormant and has not been doing its job, and\r\nthat has not been for lack of staff, centres, directives,\r\nmissions and mandates. So we support the proposed\r\nattempts to change the situation.\r\nAs the Secretary-General notes in his report,\r\nchange is a process. The United Nations needs to\r\nchange and adapt itself to meet the challenges\r\nconfronting humanity: poverty eradication, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the fight against ignorance, disease\r\nand injustice. We are not short of what needs to be\r\ndone. We are not short of decisions and\r\nrecommendations that have been adopted in this\r\nAssembly at the highest level. So I am not going to\r\nsuggest any now. The question is not, therefore,\r\nwhether there is a need for change.\r\nThe question, simply put, is whether the changes\r\ncan be managed in such a way that they make the\r\nUnited Nations an effective instrument for averting the\r\nrisk of marginalizing the majority from the process of\r\nglobalization that is taking place before our very eyes.\r\nIf that is averted, then we will have a healthy world. If\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nthat is not averted, then, I am afraid, the United\r\nNations will be a forum, as some have referred to it,\r\nthat is just a debating society. I am sure that none of us\r\nwould like it to be referred to as such. Coming from the\r\ncountry where the previous multilateral organization\r\nbefore the United Nations, the League of Nations,\r\nfailed to act. The then-head of State of Ethiopia,\r\nEmperor Haile Selassie, made a plea and his plea was\r\nnot listened to, and we know, of course, what happened\r\nto that organization. I am quite confident that the same\r\nwill not happen to this Organization, as long as we all\r\nstand up for what it stands for.\r\nMr. Sharma (Nepal): I wish to thank the\r\nPresident for convening this debate on an issue of\r\ncardinal importance to Nepal and the global\r\ncommunity. I also commend the Secretary-General for\r\nhis report on this agenda item and for introducing it to\r\nthe plenary, that report furnishes the substance for our\r\ndiscussion.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s\r\nproposal for reform of the United Nations. We believe\r\nit is a good proposal with tremendous prospects for\r\nimproving the work of the world body. That broad\r\nspectrum of recommendations is a big next step in the\r\ncontinuum of reforms the Secretary-General has\r\nundertaken thus far. As the proposal has far-reaching\r\nimplications, it calls for most careful consideration on\r\nthe part of Member States.\r\nReforms are to an organization what oxygen is to\r\nour body. The oxygen of reforms must therefore\r\ncontinue to flow to keep the United Nations alive and\r\nrobust so that it can stand up to its emerging\r\nchallenges. Otherwise, institutional atrophy will set in.\r\nBearing that in mind, the heads of State or Government\r\nhave, through the Millennium Declaration, told us what\r\nto do in a shared quest for a more peaceful and\r\nprosperous world in which human rights, justice and\r\nthe rule of law are respected and promoted. The\r\nMonterrey, Doha and Johannesburg conferences have\r\ntold us how to do it, and in order to do it all we need a\r\nstronger United Nations.\r\nNepal broadly agrees with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s diagnosis of the maladies from which the\r\nUnited Nations suffers and with many of his\r\nprescriptions to remedy the situation. For instance, we\r\nconcur with him that the General Assembly needs to\r\nrationalize its agenda further and the Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and its functional\r\ncommissions need to define and coordinate their tasks\r\nbetter. At the same time, we also believe that no reform\r\nof the United Nations would be complete without\r\nSecurity Council reforms, which are stalled now.\r\nMore specifically, we believe that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendations to reform the United\r\nNations will add tremendous value to our work and to\r\nthe service the world body provides to the citizens of\r\nthis planet. However, we need more technical detail on\r\nmost, if not all, of his recommendations before arriving\r\nat a more informed judgment. Therefore, my delegation\r\nurges the Secretary-General to provide the essential\r\ndetails quickly that substantiate his recommendations.\r\nStill, let me make a few general comments at this stage\r\non some of the specific proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThere is a clear necessity to align the budget with\r\nthe United Nations priorities and to review the linkage\r\nbetween the budget and the medium-term plan, so that\r\nboth of them remain relevant. There is also an\r\nimperative to review the budget formulation and\r\nprocessing mechanisms with a view to streamlining\r\nthem both. In that respect, the Secretary-General has\r\nmade serious and far-reaching recommendations,\r\nwhich, my delegation believes, deserve a serious and\r\nthorough examination by Member States before they\r\narrive at a conclusion. Member States should consider\r\nthe issue of flexibility for budget reallocations in the\r\ncontext of the necessity to maintain their legislative\r\ncontrol over the budget.\r\nImproving human rights management and\r\nstreamlining the reporting requirements is vital for us\r\nall, so that small and poor nations can also meet their\r\nobligations. We also broadly recognize that there is a\r\nneed to reposition the Department of Public\r\nInformation and to reform the United Nations Library\r\nso as to provide better service to Member States,\r\nparticularly to developing countries.\r\nRestructuring United Nations Information Centres\r\nwould be detrimental to the interests of information-\r\npoor developing countries if it were to lead to the\r\nweakening or closing of Information Centres in those\r\ncountries.\r\nWhile welcoming the measures to make reports\r\nmore analytical, sharply focused and consolidated,\r\nNepal underscores the need to exercise caution so that\r\nthis process does not lead to compromise in the quality\r\nor availability of documents Member States desire.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nWe cannot concur more with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that there is a palpable need to better plan\r\nofficial meetings and conferences. As a small\r\ndelegation trying to come to grips with the astonishing\r\nscope of the work of the United Nations, we know how\r\nstrenuous and painful it can be to cover numerous\r\nparallel meetings of critical importance to us. However,\r\nbetter planning of meetings and conferences should not\r\ngive way to selectivity in consultations.\r\nAlthough the efforts to pool system-wide\r\nresources to improve the coherence, synergy and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations system are\r\nwelcome, we need to know how this proposal is going\r\nto be implemented. Our concern is that this should not\r\ndilute the priority and focus of the relevant constituent\r\nparts of the United Nations, or deprive them of\r\ndynamism in their activities.\r\nThe initiative to clarify roles and responsibilities\r\nacross a broad spectrum of the issues and operations\r\ndealt with by the United Nations is long overdue. We\r\nwould, however, want to see more detailed information\r\non this issue. Meanwhile, we are convinced that the\r\ndepartments that are expected to help to implement the\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg outcomes must not be\r\ncurtailed or have their capacities impaired in the\r\nprocess. In that context, we fully support the\r\nstrengthening of the office of the Adviser for Special\r\nAssignments in Africa.\r\nNepal espouses most of the measures that have\r\nbeen outlined by the Secretary-General to improve\r\nhuman resources management at the United Nations.\r\nHowever, we would have appreciated the inclusion of\r\nmeasures to respond to such important questions as to\r\nhow efficiency could be enhanced, redundancy\r\neliminated and perquisites strongly linked with\r\nperformance. Likewise, the steps to eliminate waste,\r\nimprove the efficiency of the Organization and remove\r\nthe serious geographical imbalance that exists in the\r\nUnited Nations civil service would have attenuated our\r\nlong-standing concerns.\r\nFrom my long experience in administrative\r\nreforms, I have come to the following conclusion:\r\nthose who want to maintain the status quo should strive\r\nfor gradual reform. Those who want gradual reform\r\nshould strive for ambitious reform. Those who want\r\nradical reform are not reformers at all. Reform we\r\nmust, however, if we want to maintain relevance and\r\nvitality.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s second wave of reforms\r\nis a big step forward in the right direction. We should\r\nencourage him to implement those recommendations\r\nthat already fall within his mandate. On the other hand,\r\nMember States should urgently and carefully examine\r\nrecommendations that require fresh mandates for the\r\nSecretary-General. That is something we must do once\r\ndetailed information becomes available. We believe\r\nthat would be the right approach in moving forward.\r\nI wish to assure the President that my delegation\r\nwill extend its full support to his effort to facilitate the\r\nearliest possible implementation of the proposed\r\nreforms.\r\nMr. Stanislaus (Grenada): The timely,\r\nchallenging and forward-looking report of our\r\ndiscerning Secretary-General entitled “Strengthening\r\nof the United Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387), which we are now debating, can enhance\r\nour programme of work for years to come, if it is\r\nobjectively and conscientiously assessed.\r\nIn order to strengthen the United Nations, now in\r\nits fifty-eighth year of useful, constructive and\r\nhumanitarian service to humankind, we must engage in\r\ndispassionate self-analysis and self-criticism with\r\nrespect to the modus operandi and the modus vivendi\r\nof our Organization. It is my intention to touch briefly\r\non the former and, in the interest of a division of\r\nlabour, to leave the latter to my more sophisticated and\r\nphilosophically minded colleagues.\r\nIf an agenda for change involves change or\r\nreform for the better, we as Member States must\r\nmeasure up to the challenge and take the bull by the\r\nhorns to institute corrective measures.\r\nThe dynamics of change are usually played out in\r\nthree ways, even when change is positive and\r\ndesirable. First, there is doubt, followed by resistance\r\nand, finally, acceptance. That is amply borne out by the\r\nmany years that we have been debating reform of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nWhere are we presently — Still doubting, still\r\nresisting or a combination of both? When are we going\r\nto face the fact that there are very few certainties in the\r\nworld, but that one certainty is that of change? It is\r\ninevitable. Sometimes it can be for the better, and\r\nsometimes for the worse. That is why we have to be so\r\ncareful about instituting change.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nThat having been said, one must be blind in one\r\neye and not able to see in the other not to discern that\r\nthe least painful and most economical change that the\r\nUnited Nations can undertake in the first instance is to\r\nreduce the number and duration of statements and\r\nreports. To do that we must have the political will to\r\novercome our addiction to obfuscating and repetitive\r\nrhetoric, thereby sparing one another excessive verbal\r\npunishment. More importantly, however, consider the\r\ntime and money that can be saved if we only change\r\nour modus operandi in that regard. The Organization\r\ncan benefit considerably by clustering recurrent agenda\r\nitems for the purpose of greater economy in time, talent\r\nand finance.\r\nAdditionally, it would seem that the different\r\nagenda items allocated for debate and approval,\r\nwhether by vote or consensus, to each of the six Main\r\nCommittees by the General Assembly, can be\r\nstreamlined so that there should be no need to send the\r\nsame items back to the General Assembly for approval.\r\nThis seems redundant, as delegations hardly ever\r\nchange their positions in a matter of days. Streamlining\r\nthe work of the General Assembly and its Main\r\nCommittees can lessen duplication, confusion and\r\nredundancy — all of which diminish the proper\r\nutilization of our time.\r\nPresident John F. Kennedy in one of his profound\r\nstatements said that “we should use time as a tool, not\r\nas a couch.” Time is our greatest ally and asset and, if\r\nwell-apportioned and utilized, can be the basis of a\r\nphilosophy of life as contained in the following\r\ntreatise.\r\nTake time to think — it is a source of power. Take\r\ntime to read — it is the foundation of wisdom. Take\r\ntime to work — it is the price of success. Take time to\r\nplay — it is the secret of perpetual youth. Take time to\r\npray — it is the greatest power on Earth. Take time to\r\nlaugh — it is music to the soul. Take time to be\r\ncharitable — it is the road to Heaven.\r\nIn the interest of time, I have touched only briefly\r\nupon one aspect of agenda change in the modus\r\noperandi of our organization — less loquaciousness\r\nand more persuasive speech. This brings to mind the\r\ndivine admonition: “Let thy speech be short,\r\nencompassing much in few words” (The Holy Bible,\r\nEcclesiasticus 32:8), for very often speech can be a\r\ndevice to say nothing. Additionally, there are so many\r\nof us who can say nothing and can say it so well. In\r\nthis connection, the advice of a speech professor is so\r\napropos to the present situation:\r\n“When you speak, govern yourself by the three\r\nBs: be brief, be bright and be gone.”\r\nBefore going, however, let me reaffirm the faith\r\nand confidence of my country and my delegation in the\r\nUnited Nations, the parliament of mankind, by\r\nrecalling the compliment which the first and longest\r\nserving Under-Secretary General of the United\r\nNations, now retired, Sir Brian Urquhart, paid to the\r\nUnited Nations. “If the United Nations did not exist, it\r\nwould have to be invented.” Secretary-General Dag\r\nHammarskjöld, of beloved and revered memory, put it\r\nbest with respect to our Organization and our human\r\nfrailty when he said: “The United Nations was not\r\nintended to take us to heaven, but to save us from hell.”\r\nFinally, as I began with the dynamics of change,\r\nlet me end with the philosophy of change taken from an\r\nancient psalmist and philosopher:\r\n“Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I\r\ncannot change, the courage to change the things I\r\ncan, and the wisdom to know the difference.”\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nIt is always difficult to follow the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Grenada. However, I am going to be\r\nmy own self.\r\nMy delegation would like at the outset to\r\nassociate itself with the statements made by the\r\nrepresentative of Venezuela on behalf of the Group of\r\n77; the representative of South Africa on behalf of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement; and the representative of\r\nEgypt on behalf of the African Group. My delegation\r\nwould like to build on the positive tone of those\r\nstatements and make additional contributions here and\r\nthere.\r\nMy delegation is in complete agreement with the\r\nproposal of the President of the General Assembly that,\r\nafter the plenary debate is concluded, there be a series\r\nof informal consultations of the whole. Here, we would\r\nlike to stress that consultations should be guided by\r\ntransparency and a strategic approach, rather than get\r\ninto the time-consuming details, which are interesting\r\nbut will lead us nowhere. It is my delegation’s\r\ncontention that the attraction of some delegations to\r\ndiscussing details may be conditioned by the\r\nprescriptive nature of the report itself. Our major focus,\r\nhowever, should be on providing such guidance and\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\ndecisions that will, in the words of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral,\r\n“make the United Nations a more effective\r\ninstrument in the hands of the world’s peoples”.\r\n(A/54/2000, para. 367)\r\nThe reform package, which is well articulated by\r\nthe Secretary-General, is a continuation of the process\r\nhe launched in 1997, which Member States welcomed\r\nand approved. That experience was very rewarding in\r\nthat all Member States were involved and the outcome\r\nwas quite positive, as outlined in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. It is our hope, that this time around,\r\nthe same spirit will prevail.\r\nI hasten to add that, since the debate started\r\nyesterday, there have been very animated presentations\r\nand concrete suggestions that I believe will inform the\r\nconsultations that will follow. My delegation is of the\r\nview that we can avoid a lengthy debate on\r\ntechnicalities if, during the coming informal meetings,\r\nthe Secretariat can provide concise additional\r\nclarifications. These could be published as official\r\ndocuments to complement or supplement the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, as appropriate.\r\nLet me now touch briefly on some of the reform\r\nproposals. To start with, my delegation commends the\r\nSecretary-General for his intention to reflect the\r\npriorities set out in the Millennium Declaration in the\r\nwork of the Organization. It is the hope of my\r\ndelegation that we can all endorse that objective. Given\r\nthat the Declaration was made at the Summit, one\r\nhopes that such alignment will be system-wide. The\r\nDevelopment Goals are currently being factored into a\r\nnumber of the priorities of the Member States,\r\nincluding my own.\r\nSecondly, my delegation welcomes the thrust of\r\nthe proposals to revamp and energize the way the\r\nOrganization communicates its mission and\r\ndevelopments to the Member States and to the rest of\r\nthe global community. Our only caution is directed at\r\naction on information centres. My delegation would\r\nlike to emphasize that centres in the developing\r\ncountries require strengthening in terms of both\r\npersonnel and resources. I need hardly emphasize that\r\nthe people in the developing countries need the United\r\nNations more and not less.\r\nThirdly, as far as the strengthening of the\r\nSecretariat is concerned, my delegation is in broad\r\nagreement. However, two concerns need to be borne in\r\nmind. On the one hand, Africa needs more than\r\ncosmetic attention in the Secretariat. The problems of\r\nconflicts, diseases and development are real.\r\nCoordination at that level is vital if the resources\r\ndirected to the continent by a myriad of channels in the\r\nUnited Nations family are to have the desired impact.\r\nThe other refers to skilfully striking a balance in\r\nstrengthening the bureaucracy without undermining the\r\ndemocratic involvement of Member States. It is\r\nimportant to constantly bear in mind that any reduction\r\nof meetings should not be at the expense of the\r\ndemocratic participation of Member States.\r\nFourthly, my delegation would like to emphasize\r\nthat when it comes to proposals on subjects that have\r\ntreaty bodies, it is imperative to consult States parties\r\nto the relevant conventions on the measures envisaged\r\nto streamline reporting procedures and on the\r\nimplementation of their obligations under those\r\nentities.\r\nIn the Secretary-General’s report, there are quite\r\na number of proposals and comments on reforms that\r\nrequire attention and action by Member States. I have\r\nin mind here the reform and expansion of the Security\r\nCouncil and the strengthening of the General\r\nAssembly. It is my delegation’s hope that the President\r\nwill devote one or several informal meetings to those\r\nareas of reform, so that when we finish deliberations\r\nwe can say that we have covered all aspects.\r\nWe could possibly have made comments on many\r\nmore aspects of the report. But suffice it to say that\r\nmany of the previous interventions have been in tune\r\nwith our thinking. We need to focus on the\r\nstrengthening of the Organization, so that Member\r\nStates, without exception, can feel comfortable serving\r\nit and using it.\r\nIt is our intention to take an active part in the\r\ninformal consultations. For now, however, we welcome\r\nthe thrust of the reform package.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): There is a\r\nfamous saying from medieval times: “The times are\r\nchanging and we are changing with them”. When\r\napplied to the United Nations, that phrase can easily\r\nprovoke one to think, “If only it were that easy”. We\r\nroutinely use the phrase “a rapidly changing world”.\r\nReform in a time of globalization is a clear imperative\r\nfor everyone who believes that the United Nations, as\r\nthe only organization of global reach, must play a\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nleading role in shaping a process which is viewed with\r\nsuspicion in many quarters in the world.\r\nReform is thus not necessarily — and certainly\r\nnot only — a recognition of the fact that we have to\r\nchange our ways — even though there is of that — but\r\nalso that we have to adjust to new challenges. We thus\r\ncertainly subscribe to the need for further reform.\r\nThe reform process will be an important part of\r\nthe legacy of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He has\r\nrightly identified reform as an ongoing process and has\r\nmade it a priority of his entire tenure as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We agree that a strategic decision is needed\r\non the proposed agenda for further change, and we are\r\nready to subscribe to the overall direction and the\r\nprinciples of the report before us (A/57/387).\r\nMany of the reform measures proposed in the\r\nreport are management decisions which are entirely\r\nwithin the Secretary-General’s discretion. Others\r\nrequire action from intergovernmental bodies, which\r\nbrings us to an important aspect of reform: looking\r\nback over the past few years, we cannot but conclude\r\nthat, while major changes have been undertaken within\r\nthe Secretariat, we, as Member States, have not\r\ndelivered, or certainly not enough. Reform, and thus\r\nstrengthening, of the main organs of the Organization\r\nis a necessity, and the proposals of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in that respect are very useful.\r\nDebates on reform tend to be anticlimactic. We\r\nstart out with great enthusiasm for what we all view as\r\na necessity and are quickly bogged down in lengthy\r\ndiscussions about certain aspects which seem to be of\r\nparticular importance to some of us. The problem is\r\nthat pretty much everything we discuss in this building\r\nis of particular importance to some of us. As the\r\ncurrent Chairman of the Third Committee, I hear daily\r\nand from all sides that documentation should be\r\ndownsized, but I have yet to hear from any main\r\nsponsor of a draft resolution that a report on the\r\nimplementation of its resolution is not necessary. If we\r\nthink reform comes from good deeds by others, we will\r\nnever carry it out.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nReform discussions thus tend to be frustrating,\r\nbut we believe that effective reform is feasible if we\r\nkeep in mind what we have in common and, against\r\nthat background, compromise on what we might not\r\nnecessarily agree on.\r\nOur collective interest lies in an effective,\r\ncredible and truly representative United Nations. Some\r\nof the discussions of the past few weeks, in our view,\r\nhave made this eminently clear, and it is what we see as\r\nour common goal in this and any reform debate. This\r\nshould also enable us to overcome the North-South\r\ndivide that tends to be a very troubling phenomenon on\r\nthe occasion of reform debates. There is a greater and a\r\ncommon good at stake.\r\nThe strong emphasis placed by the report on the\r\nMillennium Declaration is a political necessity. The\r\nMillennium Declaration as a whole and the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals in particular will constitute an\r\nimportant yardstick to measure the success and failure\r\nof the Organization as a whole in the coming years. It\r\nis thus clear to us that the United Nations needs to\r\nalign its activities with the priorities identified at the\r\nMillennium Summit and at the global conferences of\r\nthe past decade, especially in a situation where we\r\nmust admit to already running behind schedule with\r\nregard to the implementation of the ambitious\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn a comprehensive approach to reform — which\r\nis needed — one should perhaps refrain from\r\ncomments on specific aspects of the package. However,\r\nin the light of the debate that has unfolded, we would\r\nlike to state on this occasion that we of course agree\r\nwith the attention given to the review of the human\r\nrights area in the framework of our reform efforts. We\r\ndo not believe, however, that this could possibly dilute\r\nthe traditional and necessary focus of the Organization\r\non the area of development. To the contrary, we believe\r\nvery strongly in the interdependence of issues of peace\r\nand security, development and human rights.\r\nStrengthening one of those areas will thus necessarily\r\nalso strengthen the others.\r\nThe key points of the report — doing what\r\nmatters, serving Member States better, working better\r\ntogether, allocating resources to priorities and investing\r\nin excellence — are principles to which we fully\r\nsubscribe and are a good reflection of what is needed\r\ntoday. We therefore fully support your intention,\r\nMr. President, to quickly bring about the political\r\nendorsement by the General Assembly of the agenda\r\nfor further change.\r\nMr. Huntley (Saint Lucia): My delegation\r\nwishes to associate itself with the statement made by\r\nthe representative of Venezuela on behalf of the Group\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nof 77 and China. But we also wanted to put forward\r\nsome of our views on the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/57/387 and Corr.1). First let me compliment the\r\nSecretary-General on his frank and thought-provoking\r\nreport and on his efforts to strengthen the Organization\r\nby trying to effect the acceptance of change in its\r\nmethods of operation and in the perspective which it\r\nbrings to the implementation of its mandate. Very\r\noften, huge bureaucracies are resistant to change.\r\nIndividuals within the bureaucratic machine are\r\nhorrified at the suggestion of even the slightest\r\ntinkering with the manner of operation that they have\r\nperpetuated over decades. They forget why they are\r\nwhere they are and make their manner of operation\r\ntheir mission, rather than being a servant of their real\r\nmission. For daring to strike out in a very different\r\ndirection, the Secretary-General deserves our praise.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report focuses on two\r\nareas for change: first, the intergovernmental organs\r\nand, secondly, the Secretariat and its work programme.\r\nIn this statement, we will limit ourselves to some\r\npreliminary thoughts on the first area: the\r\nintergovernmental organs.\r\nMy delegation agrees wholeheartedly with the\r\nSecretary-General’s view that the intergovernmental\r\norgans, too, must change. We firmly believe that the\r\nchange must start with the way we as representatives of\r\nGovernments conduct our business. If we do not\r\nchange, then change in the Secretariat alone will not\r\nstrengthen the United Nations. For that reason, we fully\r\nagree with paragraphs 15 to 24 of the report, which\r\noutline the weaknesses in the General Assembly: the\r\nmany overlapping items, the sterile and repetitive\r\ndebates and reports that waste time, the limited\r\nresolutions and agenda items that come up like\r\nrecurring decimals and the duplication of items. The\r\nreport refers also to the need for more focus in the\r\nEconomic and Social Council, the disgraceful stalling\r\nof Security Council reform and the proliferation of\r\nmeetings by the intergovernmental bodies. For smaller\r\nMissions such as ours, the report’s observation in\r\nparagraph 23 is very correct: “Many smaller Member\r\nStates now find it practically impossible to play a\r\nmeaningful role in even the most crucial activities of\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil.”\r\nWe therefore wish to exchange some preliminary\r\nideas on how we may address those deficiencies and\r\nenable small Missions to participate more effectively in\r\nthe deliberations of the body. First, the General\r\nAssembly convenes in early September for a session\r\nthat ends the following September. Yet, from the\r\nmoment of its convening, we are — as we say in the\r\nCaribbean — running around like mad fowls, caught up\r\nin a frenzy of activity on six Main Committees, the\r\nSecurity Council, subsidiary bodies, regional groups\r\nand plenary meetings of the Assembly, all competing,\r\nin a frantic spasm of meetings, to complete their work\r\nprogrammes by mid-December. Why do we subject\r\nourselves to that unnecessary stress when we have the\r\nuse of the full period of an 11-month session for a more\r\nleisurely and meaningful consideration of the work\r\nbefore us? Could not the Main Committees meet over a\r\nlonger period of time? Could they not meet without\r\nplenary meetings taking place at the same time? And\r\ncould we not alternate between meetings of the\r\nCommittees and plenary meetings? We should thus\r\ntake a serious look at how we organize the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThen, we have the other practice of subsidiary\r\nbodies and committees meeting three quarters of the\r\nway through a session, with their work being presented\r\nfor approval at the following session of the General\r\nAssembly and not at the session in which it started.\r\nMight it not make more sense for our sessions to\r\nbe organized in the following manner? After a session\r\nof the General Assembly is opened with its general\r\ndebate on policy, subsidiary bodies could meet on their\r\nwork programmes. Their reports would go to the\r\nMain Committees, which would forward their\r\nrecommendations to the Assembly. It would all end in\r\none session of the General Assembly, with the\r\nCommittees meeting consecutively, and not in parallel,\r\nover the course of the year.\r\nThere is also the question of how we organize\r\nwork in the Committees. Is it necessary, every year, to\r\nhave a general debate in the Committees on the same\r\nitems that come up before us every year, where we\r\nreproduce the same sterile statements with minor\r\nchanges from those we delivered the previous year?\r\nCan we not simply move to informal and more\r\nmeaningful discussions of draft resolutions tied to a\r\ngiven item?\r\nThen there is the question of the draft resolutions\r\nthat the General Assembly deals with every year. At its\r\nfifty-sixth session, the General Assembly considered\r\napproximately 300 draft resolutions. Were they all\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nnecessary? How much impact will they have on the\r\ndaily lives of the people whom we represent? We\r\nrecognize that this is a political and not a legislative\r\nworld body, and that some resolutions are adopted for\r\ntheir political, not legislative, impact. But there are\r\ntimes when we do indeed act as a legislative body:\r\nwhen we punish States for not adhering to some of our\r\nresolutions. No serious body adopts the same\r\nlegislation twice. It amends, strengthens or removes a\r\npiece of legislation. Could we not have a system in\r\nwhich once a resolution is adopted, it goes into our\r\nstatute books, is referred to when necessary and is\r\namended or even discarded, but is not adopted over and\r\nover again?\r\nPerhaps what we need to do is to decide at a\r\nfuture session — say, next session — not to adopt any\r\nresolutions at all. We would then spend our time\r\nexamining all the resolutions from the present session\r\nand deciding which ones we need to put in our\r\nreference book and which ones we need to discard.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to comment\r\nbriefly on one proposal in the section of the report\r\ndealing with the Secretariat: the establishment of a\r\npartnership office. The increasing role of the private\r\nsector in the global economy needs more than a\r\nvoluntary initiative like the Global Compact or a\r\npartnership office for group partnerships. There is need\r\nfor an intergovernmental monitoring mechanism to\r\nensure accountability and a positive contribution to\r\nsustainable development; this can best be served by a\r\nreinstatement of the transnational corporations unit of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMr. Kuchinsky (Ukraine): I would like to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General, whose\r\ntireless efforts in promoting the reform of the United\r\nNations since assuming office deserve not only words\r\nof praise but, first and foremost, our active support.\r\nThe substantial progress achieved in the reform effort\r\nsince 1997 hardly means that we can at last breathe\r\neasily. But it does mean that we can move ahead with\r\nconfidence in our ability to work together to achieve\r\nsuccess.\r\nThe efficiency of the functioning of the United\r\nNations is, and always will be, judged on the\r\nOrganization’s ability to respond adequately to the\r\nchallenges confronting humanity, no matter how\r\ndifficult and complicated they might be. That\r\nunderscores the need for both Member States and the\r\nSecretariat to place the functioning of the United\r\nNations under periodic review in order to be able to\r\nmake the timely adjustments, improvements and\r\nchanges that are necessary.\r\nUkraine welcomes the new package of reforms\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General in his report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387 and Corr.1). We fully\r\nsubscribe to its key objectives aimed at making the\r\nUnited Nations a more effective instrument in\r\nmultilateral relations through, to use the words of the\r\nSecretary-General, doing what matters, serving\r\nMember States better, working better together,\r\nallocating resources to priorities and investing in\r\nexcellence.\r\nUkraine encourages the Secretary-General to\r\nproceed with the implementation of the proposals and\r\nrecommendations that fall exclusively within his\r\npurview. My country is ready to work hard to reach\r\ndecisions concerning the recommendations that require\r\nappropriate actions by intergovernmental bodies. We\r\nare also looking forward to further detailed information\r\nand clarifications, including specific follow-up reports\r\ndue to be submitted within the next year.\r\nIt is important, in our view, to ensure that we\r\nproceed in an open and transparent manner, with\r\ngenuine dialogue between Member States and the\r\nSecretariat. To a large extent, our hopes in that regard\r\nrely on the leadership of the President of the General\r\nAssembly, and I want to take this opportunity to assure\r\nhim of the full support and understanding of my\r\ndelegation in his efforts to achieve tangible results.\r\nAt this point, I should like to comment briefly on\r\nsome of the proposals contained in the report.\r\nFirst, Ukraine shares the view that the activities\r\nof the Organization should be aligned with the\r\npriorities and the objectives of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and with the decisions of past global\r\nconferences. In that regard, we look forward to a\r\nthoroughly revised programme budget for the biennium\r\n2004-2005 that reflects the Organization’s new\r\npriorities and takes into account the views of concerned\r\nStates with regard to other existing mandates. We are\r\nconvinced that such a major undertaking requires prior\r\nendorsement by Member States of the modalities for\r\nformulating the next budget so that it follows the\r\nagreed format.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nSecondly, we consider the proposals of the\r\nSecretary-General in the field of the promotion and\r\nprotection of human rights to be very timely and\r\nimportant. We fully share the view that the\r\nCommission on Human Rights should operate with the\r\nhighest possible level of integrity, credibility and\r\neffectiveness. As a current member of the Commission,\r\nUkraine realizes that body’s heavy responsibility in\r\nupholding international human rights standards in a\r\nnew world environment coping with threats of\r\nterrorism and other challenges. We find very useful the\r\nproposal on a more coordinated approach to the\r\nactivities of the treaty bodies, on the standardization of\r\nvarious reporting requirements and on the possibility of\r\neach State producing a single report summarizing its\r\nadherence to the full range of international human\r\nrights treaties. The proposal to improve the special\r\nprocedures is also, in our view, long overdue.\r\nThirdly, we believe — and I am sure everyone\r\nwill agree — that it is of paramount importance to\r\nstreamline the United Nations and to improve the\r\nplanning and the servicing of meetings, which would\r\nmake our work more focused and efficient and would\r\ngreatly contribute to the process of revitalizing the\r\nGeneral Assembly. But we should not limit ourselves\r\nto a mechanical approach towards the consolidation of\r\nreports. Therefore, additional clarification with regard\r\nto this very important issue would be extremely\r\nvaluable.\r\nFourthly, we agree with the Secretary-General\r\nthat the time has come to reform the existing process of\r\nplanning, budgeting and evaluation. Such reform\r\nshould result in the creation of a transparent,\r\nstrategically oriented and streamlined budget that not\r\nonly allocates resources to priority areas, but also is\r\nflexible enough to adjust both to the changing needs of\r\nthe Organization and to the results of evaluation\r\nfindings. In the current budgetary process, the work of\r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination\r\nregarding the budget’s programme aspects is\r\nindispensable. We also see merit in giving fresh\r\nconsideration to the Secretary-General’s proposal on\r\nsunset provisions to provide for the systematic review\r\nof the impact and relevance of the Organization’s\r\nactivities in implementing its mandates.\r\nFifthly, the importance of equipping the\r\nOrganization with an effective and efficient system of\r\ninternal administration cannot be overstated. Prudent\r\nstaff management is one of the most essential\r\nconditions for the success of its activities. Here, further\r\nsteps are needed to improve the system of delegating\r\nauthority in order to spread best management practices\r\nthroughout the Secretariat. It is equally important to\r\nensure high staff motivation and morale, which should\r\nbe underpinned by competitive conditions of service\r\nand balanced between recognition of performance and\r\nenforcement of accountability. We believe that much\r\nneeds to be done to ensure equitable geographical\r\nrepresentation of Member States, especially in senior-\r\nlevel and high-level posts, within the Secretariat.\r\nFinally, I should like to mention that the\r\nSecretary-General, in his report, correctly points to the\r\nvital need to push forward with Security Council\r\nreform. In addition, advancing reform of the Economic\r\nand Social Council — another important body —\r\nthrough strengthening its coordinating role in the\r\neconomic and social spheres, and efforts to revitalize\r\nthe General Assembly should not be put at the bottom\r\nof our agenda.\r\nThe authority and the efficiency of the\r\nOrganization depend totally on its membership. If we\r\nwish to see it truly reformed and revitalized, we must\r\nshow that through our practical deeds. We must prove\r\nthat peoples can continue to rely on the United Nations\r\nand that the Organization is prepared to respond to new\r\nchallenges and to withstand any test.\r\nMr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe Argentine delegation would like to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/57/387) on the\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations. My country\r\nsupports reform of the United Nations, because it\r\nbelieves that the Organization has before it\r\nextraordinary challenges that it must face effectively.\r\nThe report submitted to us has been the subject of\r\nnumerous consultations and comments in the context of\r\nregional groups and various negotiating groups. My\r\ndelegation takes a positive and constructive attitude\r\ntowards the reform. We completely agree with the\r\nreport’s focus and its general guidelines, which we\r\nbelieve will make the Organization more agile and\r\nreinforce some areas of work that we consider\r\nessential.\r\nWe hope that once you, Sir, call for informal\r\nconsultations, we will be able to work on the\r\nacceptance by consensus of a resolution through which\r\nthe most urgent reforms can be implemented and\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nprogress can be made towards strengthening the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs a contribution, my delegation would like to\r\nformulate some observations and comments on some of\r\nthe main issues found in the report.\r\nThe proposals on human rights seem positive to\r\nus. The promotion and protection of these rights are an\r\nobjective inscribed in the Charter of the United\r\nNations. This is, therefore, a dimension that should be\r\ntaken into account in all activities. The proposed\r\nactions serve to make the international protection of\r\nhuman rights more effective, because the dispersal and\r\nproliferation of current mechanisms could make the\r\nsystem less operative. We are waiting for the proposals\r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights with\r\nregard to the future work of the treaty bodies and the\r\nspecial procedures. In this field streamlining is\r\nnecessary, so that each body may more efficiently play\r\nits role of monitoring the international commitments\r\nmade by States.\r\nIn due time, the proposals of the report should be\r\nenriched by specific recommendations derived from the\r\nMonterrey and Johannesburg summits. In this respect,\r\nwe think it is appropriate to be specific. For example,\r\nthe regional commissions should be strengthened so\r\nthat they can broaden their approach to the integration\r\nof economic, social and environment issues, as was\r\ndecided in Johannesburg.\r\nThis subject has been advocated by Latin\r\nAmerican countries, in support of the role of the\r\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean (ECLAC), and should not be omitted\r\nfrom the recommendations, which may imply a\r\nredistribution of resources.\r\nOn the subject of public information, we think\r\nthat in the production of news the few existing\r\nmultilingual channels, such as radio programmes and\r\ntraditional media, should be strengthened because the\r\npublic in developing countries does not always speak\r\nEnglish and does not have easy access to the electronic\r\nmedia. We also believe that there should be more\r\nthorough discussion of the role of the Committee on\r\nPublic Information in the elaboration of strategic\r\ncommunications and, in general, of the public-\r\ninformation work of the United Nations. It would be\r\nimportant to have a debate on what the role of this\r\nbody will be after the proposed reforms are carried out.\r\nThe measures proposed in the report to solve the\r\nshortcomings in the current process of budgeting and\r\nplanning are, as we see it, those that need more detailed\r\nfollow-up and thorough elaboration, in order to\r\ndetermine the most appropriate course of action.\r\nAn example would be the proposal concerning\r\nthe elimination of the Committee for Programming and\r\nCoordination. Consideration should be given to what\r\nbodies might absorb its budgeting functions. As\r\nregards the medium-term plan, which now is adopted\r\nfor four years and sets the basic objectives and\r\nstrategies for the Organization, limiting its coverage to\r\ntwo years and having it coincide with the biennial\r\nbudget might mean that the main objective would be\r\nlost and there would be the risk of it getting confused\r\nwith the budget itself.\r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General about the\r\nneed to simplify the process of preparing and adopting\r\nthe medium-term plan. But it is important to discuss in\r\ngreater detail the need to shorten the period it covers.\r\nFinally, we agree with the proposal concerning\r\nthe need to have a stricter system of evaluation and\r\nmonitoring, since the existing system is somewhat\r\ndiffuse, because there are a number of bodies\r\nresponsible for this task.\r\nWith regard to the Organization and its personnel,\r\nwe agree with the Secretary-General that it is necessary\r\nto increase the mobility of the staff throughout the\r\nUnited Nations system. In this respect, Argentina\r\nattaches special importance to the work of the\r\nInternational Civil Service Commission, whose scope\r\ncovers the entire United Nations system.\r\nI would like to express my support for the way\r\nyou plan to proceed, Sir. My delegation will participate\r\nin the informal consultations and will develop some of\r\nthe points that I have just mentioned. I am fully\r\nprepared to work towards a consensus solution as soon\r\nas possible and thus start the reforms that we are\r\nawaiting.\r\nMr. Al-Nasser (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Having\r\nlistened to the statement of my friend, the\r\nrepresentative of Grenada, I do not have much to add.\r\nBut, since I sent the text of my statement to our\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, I have to read it aloud.\r\nOur delegation wishes to express sincere thanks\r\nto you, Sir, for giving us the opportunity to discuss the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General entitled “Strengthening\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nof the United Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387). It is a report that has gained the attention\r\nof most delegations, creating a long list of speakers.\r\nBut since time is of the essence, our delegation will not\r\nbe able to deal with all the issues contained in the\r\nreport. We would like to affirm that we will participate\r\neffectively in the work of the relevant United Nations\r\nbodies and we will have both the opportunity and the\r\ntime to exchange points of view with objectivity and\r\ntransparency.\r\nOur delegation wishes to express its appreciation\r\nfor the valuable efforts undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, in the areas of strengthening\r\nthe role of the Organization, so that it can face the\r\nchallenges and international changes with flexibility,\r\ndynamism and transparency.\r\nThis comprehensive report has come in response\r\nto the call of the General Assembly in its resolution\r\n55/2 entitled the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration, in which the heads of State or Government\r\nstressed their individual and collective responsibility\r\ntowards their societies to enforce the principles of\r\ndignity, humanity, equality and justice for the whole\r\nworld’s population, particularly the most vulnerable.\r\nTo achieve peace, security, development, the\r\neradication of poverty, ignorance and disease,\r\nprotection of the environment, human rights,\r\ndemocracy, combating injustice, violence, terrorism\r\nand crime, the international community must make\r\ntremendous efforts so that the United Nations can\r\nbecome a more effective tool in achieving the above-\r\nmentioned goals, not only for our generation but for\r\nfuture generations as well.\r\nIn this context, we wish to reaffirm once again\r\nthe vital role of the General Assembly in effectively\r\ndischarging its duties as the principal organ for\r\ndeliberating on issues and for adopting decisions and\r\npolicies. We think that the Assembly should redouble\r\nits efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the\r\nSecurity Council as well as encourage streamlining,\r\ncoordination and regular consultations among the main\r\norgans of the United Nations. We should also continue\r\nto strengthen the Economic and Social Council as well\r\nas the International Court of Justice to assist them in\r\nplaying their Charter-mandated role.\r\nIn this respect, we call on the Secretariat to use\r\nthe available resources, in accordance with clear-cut\r\nrules of procedure decided on by the General Assembly\r\nin the interests of all Member States, to adopt the best\r\ntechnological and managerial practices available, and\r\nto concentrate on those tasks that reflect the priorities\r\nset by all the Member States.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General stresses the\r\nimportance of strengthening the United Nations and its\r\nprogrammes of action and of bringing about additional\r\nchanges in future. It is a timely and necessary report,\r\nparticularly at a time when we are facing numerous\r\nchallenges stemming from globalization.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\nand support all his efforts to strengthen the\r\nOrganization. We believe that a stronger and more\r\neffective United Nations will be able to play a vital role\r\nand fulfil its responsibilities and carry out its tasks\r\nunder the Charter, placing strong emphasis on the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nThe Secretary-General called on the Member\r\nStates to undertake a strategic dialogue among\r\nthemselves to determine the most appropriate ways and\r\nmeans to strengthen the Organization. Our delegation is\r\nfully prepared to help in this respect, and we will place\r\nthis question on our agenda. All Member States have a\r\njoint responsibility to determine how best to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General puts forward very\r\nimportant and comprehensive ideas and\r\nrecommendations to enhance the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in this increasingly\r\nglobalized world. His proposals should be viewed in\r\nthe context of the resolutions of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the outcome of the Monterrey Conference\r\nand the Johannesburg Summit for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, and the mandates handed down by those\r\nconferences, so that the General Assembly can assume\r\nits responsibility in a collective and transparent\r\nmanner.\r\nThe reform of the United Nations should be an\r\nongoing process, not an end in itself. That is why we\r\nshould adopt clear follow-up mechanisms and with\r\nrespect to the programme budget of the United Nations.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General stresses the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations as well as the\r\norganizations of civil society in all fields. He\r\nemphasized the importance of non-governmental\r\norganizations and of their participation in international\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nconferences and special sessions, and on occasion even\r\nin the General Assembly.\r\nThe rapidly increasing number of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations has put tremendous\r\npressure on the resources of the United Nations. It is\r\nmaterially impossible to absorb all the non-\r\ngovernmental organizations asking to participate in\r\nUnited Nations conferences and meetings. Moreover,\r\nthere seems to be an imbalance between the number of\r\nnon-governmental organizations from industrialized\r\ncountries and those from developing countries wishing\r\nto participate in the activities of the United Nations.\r\nThat is why we view with concern the pressure\r\nbeing put on the human and financial resources of the\r\nUnited Nations. We should limit this participation,\r\nbearing in mind the need to strike a proper balance\r\nbetween the non-governmental organizations of\r\nindustrialized and of developing countries.\r\nIn this respect, we suggest that the United\r\nNations consider the possibility of requiring a\r\ncontribution by the non-governmental organizations so\r\nthat they may participate and also to cover some of the\r\nexpenses involved.\r\nThe report also mentions the fact that, for the\r\nwork of the United Nations to reflect the priorities of\r\nthe Millennium Declaration, the Organization should\r\nput in place a flexible and efficient system that would\r\nallocate sufficient resources to such priorities. This\r\nwould require adequate planning and budgeting in\r\norder to adapt to the dynamic environment in which the\r\nOrganization is working and to give the work of the\r\nOrganization and of Member States a results-oriented\r\napproach.\r\nThe Secretary-General states that the present\r\nsystem has failed because the Member States do not\r\nalways pay their contributions in full and on time and\r\nbecause the regular budget cannot keep pace with the\r\nrate of inflation, whereas the activities of the\r\nOrganization are multiplying very rapidly.\r\nIn this respect, I should like to state that, while\r\nthe international community wishes to improve the\r\nproductivity of the United Nations, we must bear in\r\nmind the very difficult economic circumstances of\r\nmany countries, especially developing States, which\r\nmakes it difficult for them to pay the higher\r\ncontributions required. For that reason, the United\r\nNations should act wisely and shoulder some\r\nresponsibility with respect to those expenses and\r\ncontrol expenditures, so as not to put pressure on the\r\ndeveloping countries and make them pay more than\r\nthey can possibly afford.\r\nWe look forward to an amended programme\r\nbudget, which is to be submitted to the General\r\nAssembly in 2003. We hope that it will reflect the\r\npriorities of the medium-term plan as well as the\r\nMillennium Declaration Goals. Any additional\r\nfinancial requirements for proposed reforms must be\r\nvery carefully evaluated before they are approved.\r\nLast but not least, we call on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to submit improved programme budgets and\r\nmore detailed proposals concerning the medium-term\r\nplan that reflect the recommendations contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and provide improved working\r\nconditions for the United Nations staff, who should be\r\nproud of serving the United Nations and who want to\r\nfeel that they are part of an effective Organization\r\ndevoted to serving humanity as a whole.\r\nWe would like to reiterate in this respect the full\r\nsupport of our delegation for the reform process,\r\nbearing in mind the need to hold very constructive\r\ninformal consultations and deliberations among\r\nMember States to discuss the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations, to elaborate proposals that will\r\ngarner a consensus from the international community\r\nand to submit them to the General Assembly for\r\nconsideration, adoption and implementation.\r\nWe would like once again to stress the fact that\r\nwe should not bring pressure to bear on the developing\r\ncountries, whose resources are limited, and that we\r\nshould also simplify the working procedures of the\r\nOrganization and reduce the number of meetings and\r\nreports.\r\nMr. Dube (Botswana): At the outset, allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session, and\r\nfor the excellent manner in which you have conducted\r\nour deliberations thus far. You will certainly be able to\r\ncount on the full support and cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Botswana throughout your tenure.\r\nUpon assuming office in 1997, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, launched the United Nations\r\non a far-reaching path of reform. The objective was, in\r\nhis words,\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\n“to identify the ways in which the United Nations\r\ncan more effectively and efficiently meet the\r\nchallenges that lie ahead as we enter a new\r\ncentury, and a new millennium.” (A/51/950)\r\nUndoubtedly, the implementation of some of the\r\nmeasures, strategies and actions that were proposed by\r\nthe Secretary-General in his report entitled “Renewing\r\nthe United Nations: a programme for reform”\r\n(A/51/950), significantly enhanced the capacity of our\r\nOrganization to effectively undertake what we the\r\nMember States require of it.\r\nBut, as the Secretary-General rightly pointed out,\r\nreform is a continuous process, rather than an event.\r\nThe United Nations may be a better Organization today\r\nas compared with two decades ago. That should not\r\nhowever, suggest that we have completely achieved our\r\ngoal. In fact, much more remains to be done to advance\r\nthe reform process.\r\nBotswana fully supports the continued\r\ncommitment of the Secretary-General to transform the\r\nUnited Nations into a credible and robust multilateral\r\ninstitution. The proposals and actions outlined in his\r\nreport (A/57/387) are a step in the right direction, and\r\nmust be considered with an open mind.\r\nThe report, entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change”, is very timely,\r\nsince it affords us the opportunity to take stock of the\r\nachievements and failures of the United Nations since\r\nits inception and the reforms initiated in 1997.\r\nIn order for the reform process to be successful, a\r\nclose partnership between the Secretariat and Member\r\nStates is crucial. As the chief administrative officer of\r\nthe Organization, the Secretary-General can fulfil his\r\nfunctions only if he has the assured and full political\r\nand material support of the Member States from whom\r\nhe derives his mandates.\r\nAs already pointed out by several earlier\r\nspeakers, the most recent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral contains many positive elements. However, we\r\nbelieve that some ideas will require further clarification\r\nso as to enable Member States to take informed\r\ndecisions. We therefore associate ourselves with the list\r\nof questions forwarded to the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral by Venezuela, on behalf of the Group of 77\r\nand China, answers to which we believe will facilitate\r\na further exchange of views between the Secretariat\r\nand Member States.\r\nWe also appreciate the clarifications made during\r\nthe informal briefings by the Deputy Secretary-General\r\nwith regard to the fact that the report was a “strategic\r\ndocument” intended primarily to stimulate discussion\r\nby Member States.\r\nMy delegation accepts that there are actions in his\r\nreform proposals that fall directly within the purview\r\nof the Secretary-General and do not require explicit\r\napproval by Member States. We encourage the clear\r\nidentification and implementation of those actions\r\nwithout delay. There are, however, other actions\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report that we\r\nbelieve require thorough consideration and analysis by\r\nMember States before he implements them.\r\nAs we consider the report, Botswana will want to\r\nreflect on its impact on those issues that are dear to\r\nAfrica. In this regard, we want to draw the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s attention to the outcome of the high-level\r\nplenary meeting on the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), held on 16 and 17 September\r\n2002. We believe that that discussion and the\r\nconclusions of the debate brought into focus important\r\nissues which Africa has decided will govern its future\r\ndevelopment. We therefore believe that, through the\r\nreform process, there should be an integrated approach\r\nto how the United Nations will work hand-in-hand with\r\nAfrica to assist the continent to achieve its goals as set\r\nout in NEPAD.\r\nBotswana fully supports the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts to strengthen respect worldwide for all\r\nrecognized human rights. We also believe that the role\r\nand functions of the Commission on Human Rights, the\r\ntreaty bodies and special procedures should be\r\nenhanced and should not become the victim of our\r\nnarrow interests.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that a great deal\r\nstill needs to be done to strengthen the capacity of\r\nMember States to implement human rights principles\r\nand practices at the national level. It is important that\r\nthese efforts be made with the full collaboration of the\r\nconcerned Member States.\r\nWe have carefully studied the proposed measures\r\nand actions regarding the administrative and financial\r\nfunctioning of the United Nations, and I will limit my\r\nremarks to a few of those issues.\r\nWe strongly support the idea of simplifying the\r\nmanner in which we conduct our work in the United\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nNations, including in the management of our\r\nconferences and meetings. Too many prolonged and\r\nunproductive meetings cannot, in any way, be a good\r\nindicator of efficiency and productivity. We share the\r\nview that we need a results-based approach in our\r\nintergovernmental negotiations, facilitated by less\r\nsupport documentation that is more reader-friendly.\r\nMeasures to streamline reports requested by, and\r\nprovided to meetings of Member States, and adherence\r\nto page limits, are welcomed by my delegation, as long\r\nas the quality of information provided is not\r\ncompromised.\r\nWe also support the proposed measures on\r\nstreamlining the management of trust funds, including\r\nthe elimination of any duplication in the programme\r\nplanning and budgetary process of the United Nations.\r\nWe have yet to understand, however, the rationale\r\nfor the proposed changes concerning the role of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination (CPC) in\r\nthe programmatic aspects of the budgetary process, as\r\nwell as the proposed shortening of the medium-term\r\nplan. The role of the CPC, as the subsidiary body of the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the General\r\nAssembly, can be improved to enable it to effectively\r\nperform its functions, in accordance with its terms of\r\nreference annexed to Economic and Social Council\r\nresolution 2008 (LX) of 14 May 1976.\r\nWe would therefore propose that, at its forty-third\r\nsession in 2003, the CPC should intensify its\r\ndiscussions, under the relevant item already on its\r\nagenda, aimed at improving its working methods. The\r\nimportant role performed by the CPC in ensuring the\r\neffective coordination of the functions of the Economic\r\nand Social Council, the General Assembly and other\r\nentities within the United Nations system must be\r\nrecognized.\r\nFurthermore, the rationale for shortening the\r\nOrganization’s medium-term plan from the current four\r\nyears to two also requires further explanation. The\r\nmedium-term plan, as the framework for the\r\nprogramme planning, budgeting, monitoring and\r\nevaluation, as well as the main policy directive of the\r\nUnited Nations, should be of a reasonable duration to\r\nenable projection of the activities of the Organization\r\nover a reasonable timeframe.\r\nWe believe that a sound financial and human\r\nresources management policy is key to the success of\r\nany organization, including the United Nations. The\r\nstaff of the United Nations is an invaluable asset of this\r\nOrganization in contributing to furthering the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations.\r\nThere must be continued emphasis on investment\r\nin staff training to ensure that the United Nations\r\nenjoys the service of a dynamic and capable\r\ninternational civil service. Also requiring emphasis is\r\nthe enhancing of staff mobility; rejuvenating of the\r\n“ageing Secretariat”; and a strengthening of the\r\ninternal justice system to ensure amicable resolution of\r\nstaff-management disputes.\r\nAn important area that also needs urgent attention\r\nis the composition of our Secretariat, which is\r\nyet to reflect the requirements of a multinational\r\norganization.\r\nWhile we appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to create a better geographical representation\r\nof staff in the United Nations Secretariat, more remains\r\nto be done with regard to addressing the long-standing\r\nconcerns of the inadequately represented Member\r\nStates, mainly developing countries — my country\r\nincluded.\r\nWe encourage additional measures to be taken to\r\nsignificantly improve employment opportunities for\r\nnationals of developing countries in the United Nations\r\nsystem, in particular at the higher and senior levels.\r\nThe goal of attaining an equitably gender balance in\r\nthe staffing of the Secretariat is also yet to be attained.\r\nThe financial resources provided to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral also need to be commensurate with the\r\nmandates given to him by the Member States. We\r\nstrongly urge Member States to ensure that the\r\nOrganization is provided with the resources it requires\r\nto carry out its mandates.\r\nWe agree that the Secretary-General must be\r\ngranted the adequate flexibility he requires to manage\r\nthe resources at his disposal, provided there are clearly\r\ndefined checks and balances to guarantee that the\r\nSecretary-General and his staff utilize those resources\r\nin a prudent manner and remain accountable to the\r\nintergovernmental machinery for their actions.\r\nA better resources management policy should be\r\nbased on a clear division of functions between the\r\nintergovernmental machinery and the chief\r\nadministrative officer of the Organization.\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nBefore I conclude my remarks, let me assure the\r\nSecretary-General of the full support and cooperation\r\nof the delegation of Botswana in his commitment to\r\nimproving and strengthening the ability of the United\r\nNations to effectively and efficiently fulfil its mandate.\r\nWe also pledge our unqualified support to the\r\nDeputy Secretary-General, as she guides us through the\r\nreform process.\r\nMr. Aldouri (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): On behalf\r\nof the delegation of Iraq to the United Nations, I would\r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for the report\r\nbefore us today entitled “Strengthening the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change”. The report\r\nclearly outlines the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his team to make the United Nations\r\nsystem better able to face the challenges of this\r\ncentury.\r\nThe question that arises today is, why reform? Is\r\nit because the United Nations has become incapable of\r\nfulfilling its commitments and has failed to address the\r\nchallenges threatening our world? Or is it that reform is\r\nmerely an exercise in cosmetic change that gives the\r\nappearance of our interest in international relations and\r\nin keeping abreast of them? Before answering those\r\ntwo legitimate questions, one must admit that the\r\nongoing United Nations reform process underscores a\r\nvery important issue: our firm belief in this\r\nOrganization, to which we all belong, and our\r\ncommitment to its Charter. Those two components\r\nconstitute the cornerstone of a world built on peace,\r\njustice and equity. That is indeed our hope and the\r\nthrust of our common interests. We look forward, as we\r\nhave yesterday and will tomorrow, to a new century of\r\npeace and stability, in which human values and a\r\ncivilized code of conduct prevail.\r\nThe past century experienced devastating wars,\r\nturbulence and internal conflict. Following that, we had\r\nhigh hopes for peace, stability and compassion. But\r\nterrorism, hegemony, colonialism in its old and new\r\nforms, and threats to conquer nations and to change\r\ntheir systems of governments shattered many of our\r\nhopes across the world. Forces of darkness have re-\r\nemerged to impede the progress of the United Nations\r\nin this century. We should not allow these forces to\r\nprevail. Indeed, we should continue to struggle\r\nstrenuously and defiantly to overcome current and\r\nfuture difficulties. This is an inherent right and goal set\r\nout in the Charter of the Organization.\r\nThe message of reform is addressed to all\r\ncountries of the world. Its essence, simply put, is that\r\nthe principles and values upon which the world\r\nOrganization was established and the goals that we\r\nhave set ourselves require the common and constant\r\nefforts of all. It requires a pause to analyse the\r\ndifficulties, crises and problems that have impeded the\r\nfulfilment of the obligations that the United Nations\r\nsystem has undertaken. In order to embark on a serious\r\ndiscussion on this important question, it is essential to\r\naddress the current obstacles and difficulties.\r\nAs has been frequently said, we all belong to a\r\nglobal village. Nevertheless, we still lack the collective\r\nperception of humankind as one single community,\r\nsimply because certain wealthy, powerful and\r\ninfluential States in the world today continue to place\r\ntheir narrow national interests above the common good\r\nof all humankind. Moreover, international relations are\r\ndriven today by considerations of power rather than\r\nanchored in the high values and principles under which\r\nthis Organization, to which we all belong, was\r\nestablished.\r\nThe General Assembly — over which you, Sir,\r\nare presiding this year — is the only organ in which\r\nany State Member of the United Nations can participate\r\nin discussing any issue before it. Indeed, the Assembly\r\nis more open and more transparent than any other\r\norgan and should be kept that way. However, the\r\nresolutions of this Assembly do not enjoy adequate\r\nenforcement power. We must therefore consider how to\r\nenforce the resolutions of the General Assembly, most\r\nof which remain dead letter. Moreover, we must stress\r\nthe importance of General Assembly participation in\r\ndiscussing the political issues on the agenda of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Security Council reform process cannot\r\ncontinue ad infinitum. Council reform should be\r\nundertaken on the basis of the principle of equal\r\nsovereignty among States and the Council should be\r\nmore democratic, transparent and accountable. The\r\nGeneral Assembly, for its part, must have a role in\r\ncorrecting the erroneous courses of action which the\r\nCouncil occasionally takes. We believe that the\r\nexpansion of the Council’s membership must reflect\r\nthe increased membership of the Organization in order\r\nto ensure that the Council becomes more democratic,\r\nrepresentative and open.\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nWith respect to the Economic and Social Council,\r\nwe believe that there is a need to strengthen its\r\nCommittees, and especially its economic and\r\ndevelopment commissions, in view of the current grave\r\nworld economic situation. We therefore welcome the\r\nproposed coordination among the United Nations\r\norgans not only in those fields, but in all areas.\r\nThe available resources must be commensurate\r\nwith the proposed tasks in order to enhance the\r\nmandates of the United Nations system. The\r\nOrganization must receive all financial contributions\r\non time. Despite the scarcity of financial resources — a\r\ntopic that is frequently discussed in this Hall — it is\r\nvery strange that Iraq should have been prevented from\r\nmaking its financial contributions to the United\r\nNations over the past 12 years. These contributions\r\nwould be drawn from revenue accruing under the\r\nMemorandum of Understanding on the oil for food\r\nprogramme and derive 100 per cent from Iraqi sources.\r\nWhy does the United Nations not accept these\r\ncumulative arrears from Iraqi United Nations funds,\r\ndespite the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars are\r\navailable? My delegation knows as well as you do, Sir,\r\nthat there is a political objective behind this stand that\r\ndoes not do justice to the United Nations. It is the\r\nintention to deny Iraq its legitimate right to play an\r\neffective role in the work of the Organization. As all\r\nknow, Iraq was a founding Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nIn the area of human rights, we must never forget\r\nthat the world has many cultures. We believe that the\r\nenjoyment of human rights, including the right to\r\ndevelopment, is the foundation of peace and security\r\nand a principal factor in preventing conflict. We also\r\nbelieve that efforts must be made to respect human\r\nrights. This requires an integrated approach and the\r\nimmutable linkage of all civil, political, economic,\r\nsocial and cultural rights. However, efforts to\r\nimplement and consolidate civil and political rights to\r\nthe detriment of others are bound to cause friction and\r\nclashes. In order to promote respect for human rights,\r\nthe General Assembly is invited to consider the\r\ncatastrophic impact on the enjoyment of all human\r\nrights of economic sanctions that have been and shall\r\nbe imposed on nations in the name of this Organization\r\nor by some powerful States unilaterally.\r\nThe Secretary-General has devoted part of his\r\nreport to the question of the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and the protection of\r\ncivilians in times of armed conflict. At this juncture,\r\nwe would recall the grave deterioration in the living\r\nconditions of the Iraqi people under the war that has\r\nbeen tirelessly waged against Iraq for 12 years by the\r\nUnited States of America and the United Kingdom.\r\nThose two States have continuously striven to maintain\r\nthe state of siege and warfare against my country. We\r\nare all very familiar with the recent threats of war\r\nagainst my country made by the United States of\r\nAmerica and the United Kingdom.\r\nI should also like in this regard to recall the\r\nconditions of the unarmed Palestinian people in the\r\nface of Israeli practices that are in total contravention\r\nof international law, international humanitarian law and\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The time has indeed\r\ncome for the international community to ensure respect\r\nby those States for the principles of international law\r\nand the Charter of the United Nations. The United\r\nNations must have a larger role in this serious and\r\nimportant sphere, away from the narrow interests of\r\nsome major, influential Member States of the United\r\nNations.\r\nCrucial factors that would prevent armed conflict\r\ninclude the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity, upholding the rule of law, implementation of\r\ndevelopment goals, eradication of poverty, promotion\r\nof human rights and democracy and combating\r\nterrorism. These factors must be included in the\r\ndevelopment of a strategy to prevent armed conflict\r\nwhich examines both the root causes of conflict and\r\nways to address those causes.\r\nThe current international conditions under which\r\nwe live today remind us of the fact that the United\r\nNations remains relevant and indispensable, although\r\nreform is necessary for some of its structures. This is a\r\nnoble mission and my Government stands ready to\r\nparticipate effectively in this reform process in order to\r\nbuild a better future for future generations during the\r\ncurrent millennium.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate on this item.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.41\r\nBefore adjourning the meeting, I would like to\r\nmake an announcement concerning additions to the\r\nprogramme of work of the plenary of the General\r\nAssembly for Monday 4 November 2002. In the\r\nmorning, the General Assembly will consider as the\r\nfirst item, agenda item 16, election of 20 members of\r\nthe Committee for Programme and Coordination.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 52.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
