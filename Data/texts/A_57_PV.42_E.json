(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 52 (continued)\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/387 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nMs. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan): I thank you,\r\nMr. President, for convening this important meeting.\r\nMy delegation would like to join previous speakers in\r\ncommending the Secretary-General for initiating the\r\nnew reform proposals contained in his report entitled\r\n“Strengthening of the United Nations: an agenda for\r\nfurther change” (A/57/387 and Corr.1).\r\nThe report under consideration today is\r\ncomprehensive and very timely and is aimed at\r\nimplementing the goals of the Millennium Declaration\r\nand the outcomes of the major international\r\nconferences, including the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development.\r\nMy delegation shares the view expressed by other\r\ndelegations that the document represents a milestone\r\non the road towards further improvements in the\r\nactivities of both the General Assembly and the\r\nSecretariat. We believe that reform should be a\r\ncontinuing process, since there are still many areas in\r\nthe United Nations which need to be rationalized. We\r\ndeeply appreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General\r\nto make the Organization into a more effective and\r\nflexible instrument in order to enable it to respond to\r\nthe wide range of new global challenges.\r\nMy Government fully supports the strong\r\ncommitment of the Secretary-General further to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations. Under his leadership,\r\nthe Organization has undergone numerous changes in\r\nrecent years and significantly improved its\r\nperformance.\r\nThere is no doubt that the full implementation of\r\nthe second phase of the reform proposed by the\r\nSecretary-General will require constructive support on\r\nthe part of the Member States. In this regard, we\r\ncommend the efforts of the President of the General\r\nAssembly to enhance the transparency of the process,\r\nin which all interested delegations will be involved.\r\nMy delegation deems this approach to be the most\r\nappropriate one, as the report of the Secretary-General\r\nmerits comprehensive deliberations which, we believe,\r\nwill result in the adoption of a resolution endorsed by\r\nall Member States.\r\nMy delegation also commends the intention of the\r\nPresident of the General Assembly to prepare a paper\r\nthat will provide explanations with respect to the major\r\nissues which have been raised by regional groups and\r\nMember States. This measure will undoubtedly\r\naccommodate the concerns of delegations and stimulate\r\nthe negotiation process.\r\nKazakhstan attaches great importance to the\r\nactivities of the Organization in the economic and\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nsocial fields. We agree with the Secretary-General that\r\nthe United Nations should expand its presence in the\r\ndeveloping world by improving its effectiveness and its\r\nresponsiveness.\r\nWe believe that the reform measures must enable\r\nthe United Nations fully to implement all mandated\r\nprogrammes which strengthen the capacities of the\r\ndeveloping countries to address the challenges of a\r\nglobalized economy.\r\nWe welcome the idea of improving the planning\r\nand budgetary processes of the Organization. My\r\ndelegation supports those delegations which think that\r\nthe budget cycle needs to be modernized in order better\r\nto serve a renewed Organization. Indeed, a more\r\nbalanced, transparent and strategic document must be\r\nelaborated that reflects our priorities and consequent\r\nresource requirements.\r\nIt goes without saying that further improvement\r\nof United Nations activities in the field of information\r\nis an integral part of the whole reform package. The\r\nrole of the Department of Public Information must not\r\nbe underestimated, since the United Nations is\r\nrepositioning itself with a view to acquiring even\r\ngreater relevance as an indispensable global institution.\r\nWe believe also that the activities of the United\r\nNations Information Centres deserve serious\r\nconsideration.\r\nWe acknowledge the need to strengthen the\r\nactivities of the General Assembly. We believe that the\r\nDepartment for General Assembly and Conference\r\nManagement must play a more active role in managing\r\ndocumentation and meetings.\r\nWe support also the continuing improvement of\r\nhuman resources management. We attach particular\r\nimportance to the implementation of the principle of\r\nequitable geographic distribution with regard to\r\nSecretariat staff.\r\nWe wish to see a reformed Security Council that\r\nis open to dialogue and sends the international\r\ncommunity a clear message that it stands ready to meet\r\nnew challenges. We hope that the President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly will bring the negotiation process\r\nback to life in order to reach a comprehensive package\r\nagreement on Council reform.\r\nWe welcome the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to establish a high-level panel to review the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and civil\r\nsociety.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to assure the Assembly\r\nof our full support for the continuing efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to strengthen the role of the\r\nOrganization in the twenty-first century and of the full\r\ncooperation of my delegation in the promotion of\r\nfurther deliberations.\r\nMrs. Hughes Ferrari (Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines): My delegation, while aligning itself fully\r\nwith the statement made by Ambassador Vicente\r\nVallenilla on behalf of the Group of 77 and China,\r\nconsiders it appropriate to make some brief comments\r\non the specific and particular problems of the smallest\r\nStates Members of the United Nations. Saint Vincent\r\nand the Grenadines undoubtedly falls into this\r\ncategory.\r\nMy Government is firm in its view that,\r\nnotwithstanding our smallness and relative poverty, it\r\nis vital to our national interests that we maintain a\r\npresence at this forum, although the cost of\r\nestablishing and maintaining a Mission in New York\r\nputs a great strain on an already overburdened\r\neconomy. For this reason, it is critical that the\r\nrepresentatives here in New York serve their country\r\nwell. However, I will try to pinpoint one or two reasons\r\nwhy it is so very difficult for mini-States to play the\r\nkind of role to which we aspire.\r\nFirst of all, it is quite obvious that the architects\r\nof the United Nations agenda were representatives of\r\nStates that were not constrained by lack of resources,\r\neither financial or, more importantly, human. How\r\notherwise could we explain why the vast bulk of the\r\nUnited Nations agenda is crammed into a few short\r\nweeks between September and December each year?\r\nDuring these weeks, all of the main committees are\r\nmeeting, very often simultaneously. There are also\r\nnumerous meetings of the plenary, as well as a\r\nmultitude of other events, seminars, briefings, meetings\r\nof regional groups, and so on, which are an integral\r\npart of the functioning of the Organization. Add to this\r\nnightmarish scenario the vast mountain of official —\r\nand unofficial — documentation that has to be tackled\r\non a daily basis, and one can easily see that a dozen or\r\nmore bodies would be needed for a delegation to\r\nfunction in even a modest way.\r\nFor a Mission with what can only be described as\r\na skeleton staff, it is quite impossible to contribute to\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nthe workings of the United Nations in the way that we\r\nwould like, given that, try as we might, we have not\r\nfound a way to be in two places at once, far less three\r\nor more.\r\nIt may be impertinent of me to even think such\r\nscandalous thoughts, but I make bold to ask if it would\r\nnot be possible to rethink the United Nations agenda\r\nwith a view to spreading the work more evenly\r\nthroughout the calendar year.\r\nThe other issue I wish to address is that of\r\ncandidatures to the various United Nations bodies or\r\norgans. I wish to put forward the opinion that it is high\r\ntime that the United Nations devised a system of\r\nequitable and automatic representation, on a rotating\r\nbasis, for its Member States on its principal organs.\r\nNot only would this ensure equity, democracy and\r\nfairness in the system, but it would, at a stroke, remove\r\nthe need for our endless processions to and from the\r\nIndonesian Lounge. This would not only free up\r\nprodigious amounts of time for hard-working\r\ndelegations, but would also result in significant savings\r\nfor Member States due to not having to campaign. I\r\nwould like to suggest that these savings could be\r\ndeposited in a special fund to assist the world’s poor.\r\nIn closing, I quote from paragraph 23 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report:\r\n“The proliferation of meetings and official\r\ndocuments places excessive demands on both the\r\nSecretariat and Member States. Many smaller\r\nMember States now find it practically impossible\r\nto play a meaningful role in even the most crucial\r\nactivities of the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council”.\r\nI cannot say it any better than the Secretary-\r\nGeneral did, and, on that note, I rest my case.\r\nMr. Balarezo (Peru)(spoke in Spanish): In a\r\nrecent article on the future of the United Nations in the\r\nnew millennium, the Deputy Secretary-General rightly\r\nmaintained that the Organization faces three main\r\nchallenges: the challenge of legitimacy, which implies\r\nthat international organizations should be more\r\ntransparent, participatory and democratic when it\r\ncomes to taking decisions; the challenge of\r\nconsistency, which requires programme adjustments\r\nand better inter-agency coordination, as well as a\r\ngreater political willingness on the part of its Member\r\nStates to provide resources and authority that the\r\nUnited Nations requires to comply with its objectives;\r\nand, finally, the challenge of effectiveness, measured in\r\nterms of available instruments and the effective\r\nimplementation of internationally agreed commitments\r\nat the national level. The delegation of Peru fully\r\nshares this vision and feels that these three principles,\r\nalong with transparency and accountability, are the\r\nbasis on which the Organization should rest.\r\nIt is in this context that we welcome and\r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General for the reform\r\nprogramme that he is submitting to us. This must be an\r\nundertaking by all of us. The Organization is at the\r\nservice of member countries, and member countries\r\nmust offer its Secretariat the means and instruments\r\nthat make it possible to comply with these objectives,\r\nwhich are none other than those defined and approved\r\nby the members themselves. There can be no other\r\nagenda.\r\nThese reforms, as correctly pointed out by the\r\nSecretary-General, must be accompanied by changes in\r\nintergovernmental bodies, and for this reason, it is\r\nurgent to streamline and prioritize the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, strengthen the role of the Economic\r\nand Social Council in the area of development, resolve\r\neconomic and social international problems and\r\nproceed immediately to the democratization of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nPeru agrees with the Secretary-General on the\r\nneed to adjust the Organization’s budget and\r\nprogramme instruments to the priorities that we have\r\nset for ourselves. It is crucial for the delegation of Peru\r\nthat the United Nations system programme of activities\r\nbe focused on the eradication of global poverty, and\r\nthis requires that the developing countries achieve\r\nhigh-end sustained economic growth. It is also\r\nfundamental to fully implement the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, as well as the Monterrey consensus and\r\nthe outcome of the Johannesburg summit.\r\nWe support the ideas of the Secretary-General to\r\nemphasize questions that are not receiving proper\r\nattention, such as globalization and its positive and\r\nnegative consequences for development, migration,\r\nwater shortages and conflict prevention, among other\r\nthings.\r\nBut we also believe there are other serious\r\nproblems that should be studied with greater emphasis.\r\nBesides financial vulnerability and the recurrence of\r\nnatural disasters as a result of climate change, Peru is\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nparticularly concerned by persistent unemployment in\r\ndeveloping countries and the growing social\r\nrequirements that compromise democratic viability. We\r\nhave to find creative formulas in order to strengthen\r\ndemocracy and governance.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his\r\nproposal to present a revised programme budget in\r\n2003, with the desire to provide an efficient instrument\r\nfor the Organization to comply with its task. The\r\ndelegation of Peru feels that it is important to grant the\r\nSecretary-General greater autonomy in the\r\nadministration of resources. This greater flexibility\r\ncould be accompanied by criteria for certain priority\r\nprogramme lines for developing countries which\r\nshould not fall below the established limit.\r\nThe arguments that the duties of the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination (CPC) go to the Fifth\r\nCommittee seem to be quite sound. This would give a\r\ngreater consistency between strategic and programme\r\nplanning, as well as budget allocation. If this proposal\r\nis approved after a more exhaustive assessment, we\r\nsuggest that financial support continue so that experts\r\nfrom capitals of developing countries can take part in\r\nthe debates of the Fifth Committee.\r\nPeru is fully committed to democracy, good\r\ngovernance and the protection and promotion of human\r\nrights. As a result, we support the efforts designed to\r\nstrengthen and perfect the United Nations human rights\r\nmachinery and effective compliance with international\r\ncommitments undertaken by Member States. As a\r\nresult, we are awaiting an occasion to become familiar\r\nwith and to express ourselves on the different reports\r\nand recommendations requested by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, in actions 2 to 5.\r\nSince it is not possible to dwell on all the\r\nproposals here, the delegation of Peru would simply\r\nlike to record its support for the strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations relationship with civil society and the\r\nprivate sector, for the need to improve the\r\nOrganization’s human resources policies, the strategic\r\nredefinition of the Department of Public Information\r\nand the enhancement of the Department of Economic\r\nand Social Affairs.\r\nPeru believes that it is of utmost importance to\r\nstrengthen technical cooperation for developing\r\ncountries. However, we are not very clear on what is\r\nbeing proposed in this area. It is important, of course,\r\nto establish a division of responsibilities and duties.\r\nBut it is also important to have alternative approaches,\r\ninstruments and sources of financing and technical\r\ncooperation to meet the needs of the countries that are\r\non the receiving end.\r\nI would like to conclude with two items. First of\r\nall, it seems certain that there has been some fatigue\r\nwhen it comes to holding major conferences. This,\r\nhowever, should not prevent periodic reviews of the\r\nimplementation of commitments undertaken; nor\r\nshould it deny the opportunity of calling upon the\r\npolitical will of Member States or the conscience of\r\npublic opinion. We can imagine, for example, that,\r\nearlier than we might expect, we may feel the need to\r\nconvene a world summit on global governance,\r\nincluding the question of global public good.\r\nSecondly, we feel that it is important to have a\r\nmore fluid and ongoing interaction between the various\r\nstrata of Secretariat staff with Member States on the\r\nactivities and work plans that are being carried out in\r\nthe concrete implementation of the budget, as well as\r\nthe medium-term plan. This is not a question of\r\ntransparency, nor is it one of scrutiny. We do believe\r\nthat this exists. Rather, it is a matter of achieving more\r\nfluid communication, as well as human contact. For\r\nexample, for any representative who would like to\r\nbecome informed about certain facts, activities or to\r\nexchange points of view, all he or she can do is to read\r\nthe reports, attend occasional panels or request\r\ninterviews.\r\nFor this reason, the delegation of Peru feels that,\r\nas is common practice for any corporate management,\r\nit would be highly positive to have periodic informal\r\nmeetings with the Under-Secretaries-General, heads of\r\ndepartment and their teams on the different activities\r\nthat are being carried out or being planned, as well as\r\nan exchange of points of view on questions of\r\nparticular interest. These meetings could be held with\r\nthe regional groups or other groups, such as the Rio\r\nGroup. This would strengthen the feeling of belonging\r\nand partnership with the purpose that unites us all, that\r\nis, to achieve legitimacy, consistency and effectiveness\r\nfor the Organization.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): On behalf of the delegation of Ecuador, I am\r\npleased to congratulate and thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report on strengthening of the United\r\nNations (document A/57/387) and to express our firm\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nand decisive support for the proposals contained\r\ntherein. This valuable document reflects the need to\r\ncarry out thorough reforms within the Organization in\r\norder to ensure that its work is effective and efficient,\r\nwhich would make it possible to comply with the\r\nobjectives pointed out in the United Nations Charter, as\r\nwell as the goals that have been set by member\r\ncountries in recent world summits.\r\nThere have been changes. However, much still\r\nremains to be done. In order to take positive and\r\nfruitful steps towards the accomplishment of this\r\nobjective, the Organization must respond to current\r\ndemands, as well as to the new realities, of a world that\r\noffers enormous challenges and, at the same time, great\r\nopportunities.\r\nIn order to achieve one of the basic objectives of\r\nthe Organization — a better world, more just, equitable\r\nand supportive — it is necessary to have the political\r\nwill for establishing a solid foundation to enable\r\nleadership of the international community.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration is a framework for\r\nfuture action of the United Nations. The heads of State\r\nor Government of the Member countries expressed\r\ntheir commitment to making the Organization a more\r\neffective instrument in achieving the priority themes,\r\nsuch as the struggle for the development of all peoples\r\nin the world; the fight against poverty, ignorance and\r\ndisease; the fight against injustice; fight against\r\nviolence, terror and crime; and the fight against the\r\ndegradation and destruction of our planet.\r\nThe Monterrey International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development held in Johannesburg are\r\nimportant steps that have been taken in the past year\r\nand that establish very explicit and agreed upon lines\r\nof action to fulfill the goals that we have expressed.\r\nIn order to make substantive progress towards\r\nthese objectives, we must immediately tackle the task\r\nof implementing the agreements that emerged from\r\nthese summits. It is necessary to transcend mere words\r\nor reiteration of commitment and move towards the\r\nsearch for and implementation of innovative, viable\r\nand effective mechanisms that will lead us towards the\r\nobjective we are all pursuing — that is, international\r\npeace and security.\r\nWe firmly believe that only development, in its\r\nbroadest sense, would make it possible to move\r\ntowards solid and lasting peace and international\r\nsecurity. Social justice, respect for human rights and\r\nbetter opportunities for work and production for people\r\nin the developing world constitute the basis of a true\r\nguarantee of international security.\r\nWith the passing of time and increase in the\r\nnumber of its tasks, the General Assembly has stopped\r\nbeing the scene of major debates and a forum where we\r\nmeet and willingly seek solutions to the challenges that\r\nhistory presents us with. Faced with this reality, it\r\nbecomes clear that there is a need to reaffirm the\r\nprimary function of the General Assembly, the main\r\ndeliberative body that adopts policies and represents\r\nthe United Nations, and where all States, without\r\nexception, take part democratically in deliberations.\r\nFor these reasons, it is certain that we need a\r\nrenewed and strengthened multilateral system that\r\nwould lay down the solid groundwork for effective\r\ninternational cooperation, based on common principles\r\nand norms, taking into consideration the requirements\r\nof the day.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights is\r\nof great importance for my country. In this respect, we\r\nfeel it is particularly important to stress the proposal\r\ndesigned to improve different aspects of the\r\nrelationship of Governments with the United Nations\r\nsystem. We greatly value the proposals that aim to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations capacity to assist\r\ncountries with the establishment of solid human-rights\r\ninstitutions.\r\nWe share the idea that public opinion is\r\nfundamental to strengthening the United Nations, as\r\npointed out by the Secretary-General in his report. As a\r\nresult, we believe that the proposals to redefine the\r\nduties of the Department of Public Information are also\r\nimportant.\r\nMr. President, the delegation of Ecuador would\r\nlike to congratulate you on your current efforts to\r\npromote new stages in the reform process of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, and we support them firmly. We\r\nalso express our willingness to cooperate with the\r\nprocess that will lead to the revitalization of the\r\nOrganization and make it possible to comply with the\r\nvision of men and women of this planet who would like\r\nto change the realities that affect our world.\r\nMr. Niculescu (Romania): Mr. President, at the\r\noutset, allow me to thank you for organizing such a\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\ntimely debate on this agenda item, which is a matter of\r\nkeen interest to all Member States, as well as for your\r\ninitiative in launching the process of informal\r\nconsultations on further reform of our Organization,\r\nwith the active and much appreciated participation of\r\nour Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Louise Frechette.\r\nMy delegation has studied with particular interest\r\nthe Secretary General’s report entitled “Strengthening\r\nof the United Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\nwhich, without setting new priorities, brings to the fore\r\nsome areas where we should focus our reform efforts in\r\nthe coming months. This reform process began in 1997,\r\nand we continue to have full confidence in the capacity\r\nof the Secretary-General to direct and administer such\r\na comprehensive reform. It is in this spirit that we\r\nshare his vision on ways and means to arrive at a\r\nstronger United Nations, one better adapted and more\r\nresponsive to the demands made by an era of\r\nglobalization and unconventional challenges and\r\nthreats.\r\nIn this respect, we agree that the main pillars of\r\nthe United Nations system should be subject to a\r\ncareful reform, based on the priorities and targets we\r\nset together in the Millennium Declaration. Thus, both\r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil need to adapt in order to realize their potential,\r\nand the process of Security Council reform needs new\r\npolitical impetus.\r\nTurning to some more specific issues on the\r\nagenda for further change, my delegation aligns itself\r\nwith the statement delivered on behalf of the European\r\nUnion by the representative of Denmark and has\r\nseveral short comments and recommendations.\r\nAs the Secretary-General suggests in his report,\r\nthe increasing role of the United Nations in dealing\r\nwith globally important social and economic issues\r\ncalls for a corresponding strengthening of the role\r\nplayed by the principal organ concerned — namely, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council — which could become,\r\nin our view, the preeminent global forum for shaping\r\ndevelopment policies and strategies. We support the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation about clarifying\r\nthe General Assembly’s responsibilities vis-à-vis those\r\nof the Economic and Social Council and its functional\r\ncommissions, in particular in relation to follow-up to\r\nthe major conferences, in a way that will enable the\r\nAssembly to add value to the work of these bodies.\r\nMy delegation considers as necessary a\r\ncomprehensive reorganization of the Department of\r\nPublic Information, including a clear definition of its\r\nrole within the United Nations system and a more\r\ncoherent attribution of its responsibilities. We\r\nappreciate that, through its repositioning, the\r\nDepartment of Public Information will be able to\r\ndevelop more strategic activities and become a more\r\neffective tool in promoting a general picture of United\r\nNations specific activities for the benefit of\r\ninternational public opinion. We are looking forward\r\nwith great interest to hearing from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his next report his specific proposals\r\nregarding the comprehensive review of the Department\r\nof Public Information’s management system and\r\nactivities, and we indicate our openness to a\r\nconstructive dialogue with other delegations in this\r\nrespect during the next session of the Committee on\r\nInformation.\r\nRegarding the United Nations information\r\ncentres, Romania hosts such a Centre in Bucharest. The\r\nCentre is integrated with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) field office.\r\nRomania supports the functioning of such centres in\r\nclose cooperation with the system of the Resident\r\nCoordinator. On the subject of regional centres, we\r\nsupport the rationale for and the proposed substantive\r\napproach of all such centres’ activities, while\r\nrespecting the principle of the need for preliminary\r\nagreement on the part of the host country targeted for\r\nthe establishment and functioning of possible regional\r\ncentres. We await with interest the Secretariat’s\r\nrecommendations that are to be included in the\r\nadditional report with a comprehensive review of the\r\nactivities of the information centres drafted by the\r\nOffice of Internal Oversight Services.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the fact that upgrading\r\nand improving the efficiency of the working methods\r\nof United Nations libraries is a necessary element of\r\nreform intended to, among other things, improve the\r\ncurrent electronic access to the United Nations\r\ndocuments. We are convinced that a thorough\r\nexamination of the different categories of publications\r\nissued by the Secretariat is much needed. That review\r\nshould aim at reducing the number of publications\r\nwhile ensuring higher quality of content. We note that\r\ntwo additional reports are expected, one on the review\r\nof the United Nations system of libraries and the other\r\non United Nations documents and publications. We\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nbelieve that a future debate on these issues will be\r\nbeneficial.\r\nRomania supports the proposals put forward in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report regarding the\r\nstrengthening of the Organization’s capability to\r\npromote and protect human rights. We particularly\r\nwelcome the proposals aimed at consolidating the\r\npotential of the United Nations to assist Member States\r\nto develop stronger national institutions in the field of\r\nhuman rights. We believe that the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights may\r\nplay a crucial role in this respect.\r\nIn recent years, the interaction between the\r\nUnited Nations system and civil society organizations\r\nhas reached unprecedented levels. More than 2,000\r\nnon-governmental organizations (NGO) currently enjoy\r\nconsultative status with the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil, while thousands of such organizations have\r\ntaken part in the various global events organized during\r\nthe last decade under the aegis of the United Nations in\r\nthe political and economic fields, as well as in global\r\nevents dedicated to human rights topics. The\r\nMillennium Declaration enshrines the commitment of\r\nMember States to develop the potential offered by\r\ncooperation between the United Nations, civil society\r\nand the private sector. Nevertheless, we believe that\r\nincreased coherence in the procedures for the\r\naccreditation and participation of NGOs in United\r\nNations activities is yet to be found.\r\nAs we urged during the work of the Special\r\nCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations, my delegation\r\nfavours a clear designation of the responsibilities\r\nconferred upon the two Secretariat departments playing\r\na key role in maintaining peace and international\r\nsecurity, namely the Department of Political Affairs\r\nand the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. That\r\nshould be done while ensuring improved cooperation\r\nbetween the two Departments. It is our understanding\r\nthat the basic role of the Department of Political\r\nAffairs lies in the fields of preventive diplomacy,\r\nconflict prevention and peace-building. That\r\nDepartment therefore has responsibility for United\r\nNations political and peace-building offices in the\r\nfield, while the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations coordinates the planning and management\r\nof all peace and security operations across the world. In\r\nthat context, we reiterate the integrative and\r\ncoordinating role to be played by the Executive\r\nCommittee on Peace and Security in accordance with\r\nthe Brahimi report.\r\nWith regard to the budgetary and financial\r\nimplications of the reform package put forward by the\r\nSecretary-General, we take as a starting point the fact\r\nthat the assumptions of our work are spelled out by the\r\nMillennium Declaration. In order to efficiently follow\r\nup on the priorities contained in the report, a flexible\r\nsystem for the allocation of adequate resources needs\r\nto be considered. While the underlying pattern of the\r\nbudgetary process may have to be changed over time, a\r\ncomprehensive review of the planning and budgeting\r\ncycle to align it with a results-based approach is\r\nnevertheless timely and welcome. An accountable\r\nplanning and budgeting process should be responsive\r\nto the dynamic environment in which the Secretariat\r\noperates, not least in serving to simplify and improve\r\nprocedures. For their part, it is imperative that Member\r\nStates agree to ensure more streamlined and\r\nstrengthened intergovernmental processes.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration could not be better\r\nsupported than by improving the Organization’s\r\nhuman, physical and information technology\r\ninfrastructures. Enhanced programme delivery could\r\nresult through investing in human resources\r\nmanagement and swift implementation of the capital\r\nmaster plan.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express Romania’s\r\nfull support for the general vision embodied in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report. In our opinion, that report\r\nrequires a prompt, positive and integrated response on\r\nour part. We should also recognize that some\r\nrecommendations and details are still subject to\r\nclarification and further agreement among Member\r\nStates.\r\nMr. Sealy (Trinidad and Tobago): Speaking so\r\nlate in this debate, in which many delegations have\r\nalready engaged in an exhaustive examination of the 36\r\nsix actions recommended by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis report entitled “Strengthening of the United\r\nNations: an agenda for further change” (A/57/387), it is\r\nthe desire of the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago to\r\ndraw to the attention of the Assembly some aspects of\r\nthat report that it considers to be fundamental if small\r\ndelegations such as my own are to be able to\r\nparticipate effectively and efficiently in the work of the\r\nannual sessions of the General Assembly.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nThe Secretary-General observes in his report that\r\nit is\r\n“crucially important that the Assembly continue\r\nits own reform efforts to further rationalize its\r\nagenda.” (A/57/387, para. 16)\r\nIn that regard, he also notes that\r\n“Great improvements are possible, however, if\r\nduplicative items can be combined, and closely\r\nrelated issues clustered into a single discussion,\r\nleading to outcomes of greater policy relevance\r\nand impact.” (ibid)\r\nMy delegation has noted that some measures in that\r\nregard have already been put in motion. We welcome\r\nthat development, but believe that further action is\r\nnecessary in that respect.\r\nThe Secretary-General also points out that\r\n“The pattern of recurring agenda items should\r\nalso be rigorously reviewed, with many issues\r\naddressed biennially, or at even longer intervals.”\r\n(ibid)\r\nThat approach to the rationalization of the agenda is\r\none to which the delegation of Trinidad and Tobago\r\ncan subscribe fully, as it would give member\r\nGovernments a more adequate time frame within which\r\nto implement at the national level commitments\r\nundertaken at the international level. Additionally, it\r\nwould afford the Secretariat the opportunity to\r\noptimally rationalize its use of resources in carrying\r\nout the many actions called for in all of our resolutions.\r\nSuch an approach would also enable the United\r\nNations to revisit a subject area after a number of years\r\nto determine what substantive developments have in\r\nfact taken place within that period at the global level.\r\nOf course, the issues to be so treated should be\r\nidentified through a process designed on the basis of\r\ntransparent, clearly defined and agreed criteria.\r\nA related aspect of this issue is that, while it is a\r\ncustomary practice at almost every annual session of\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly to allow States\r\nthe opportunity to request the inclusion of additional\r\nagenda items, there is not a corresponding tendency on\r\nthe part of States to remove any items from the\r\nAssembly’s agenda. It is the view of the delegation of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago that a proactive General\r\nCommittee, given its broad and representative nature,\r\ncan effectively discharge the mandate of determining\r\nthe periodicity with which agenda items are considered\r\nand/or the possibility of their deletion from the agenda.\r\nThe Secretary-General has also referred in his\r\nreport to the overwhelming number of meetings.\r\nAccording to his report, over the biennium 2000-2001\r\na staggering 15,484 meetings were held and 5,879\r\nreports were issued. The proliferation of meetings and\r\nofficial documents, in his view, places excessive\r\ndemands on both the Secretariat and Member States,\r\nand his report goes on to state quite categorically that\r\n“Many smaller Member States now find it practically\r\nimpossible to play a meaningful role in even the most\r\ncrucial activities of the General Assembly” (para. 23).\r\nAs a result of those pressures, the report indicates that\r\nthere is now a palpable need to curtail the volume of\r\nofficial meetings and documents.\r\nThe situation is exacerbated further, as noted in\r\nthe report, due to the fact that at present the “reports\r\nare overwhelming in number, tend towards duplication\r\nand are fragmented in their impact” (para. 87). More\r\nthan 500 reports, it is stated, were submitted to the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, and the\r\nSecretary-General returns to an all too familiar theme\r\nwhen noting that Member States, especially the smaller\r\ncountries, find it difficult to cope with the mountains of\r\npaper that need to be absorbed and acted upon. The\r\nSecretariat itself, the report continues, is struggling to\r\nkeep abreast of the growing number of reports\r\nrequested by the various inter-governmental bodies and\r\nthe sheer volume of the demands is “drowning its\r\nability to provide focused and value-added analysis”\r\n(para. 88).\r\nThe Secretary-General’s overall analysis of this\r\nsituation, which also highlights the frequency of\r\nreporting and the fact that requests for reports to be\r\nproduced periodically stay on the books long after they\r\nhave become obsolete, leads to his action 11, which\r\ncalls for consolidating reports on related subjects and\r\nfor the General Assembly to establish a mechanism to\r\nreview the continuing need for and frequency of\r\nrecurring reporting requirements. The delegation of\r\nTrinidad and Tobago supports the Secretary-General’s\r\ncall for such a mechanism and is of the opinion that the\r\nrespective bureaux of the Main Committees, together\r\nwith the prime movers of individual draft resolutions,\r\ncan play an effective role in that regard.\r\nThe delegation of Trinidad and Tobago, as a\r\nsmall delegation of a small United Nations Member\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nState, is of the view that action in those two areas\r\nwould be extremely beneficial to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and would lead to more effective\r\nparticipation by Member States, large and small, in the\r\nannual deliberations of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation has not found it opportune at this\r\ntime to examine every action recommended in the\r\nreport, but wishes to draw to the Assembly’s attention\r\nthat the initiatives in the report reflect the ideas and\r\nsuggestions of every part of the Secretariat and the\r\nconsultations held with all of the funds and\r\nprogrammes of the Organization. The observation was\r\nalso made by the Deputy Secretary-General during the\r\ninformal briefing that the Committee on Conferences is\r\nsupportive of the actions recommended in respect of its\r\narea of competence and that the chapter on human\r\nresources has been discussed with staff representatives.\r\nThe Secretary-General has himself restated in his\r\nintroduction of the report that the whole package hangs\r\ntogether as a coherent whole, and he has asked us to\r\ntreat it as such. The Secretary-General has done his\r\nwork, and it is now up to the Assembly to give him a\r\nclear and positive legislative mandate for him to\r\nproceed to implement the further reforms that he, as the\r\nchief administrative officer, has identified that the\r\nsystem is in need of in the short, medium and long term\r\nif we are to make the United Nations a more effective\r\ninstrument in the service of mankind.\r\nThe delegation of Trinidad and Tobago is\r\nprepared to work with you, Mr. President, and with\r\nother interested delegations in any open-ended\r\ninformal consultations to discuss in depth the actions\r\nrecommended in the report and to prepare the\r\nnecessary omnibus draft resolution, which we are sure\r\nwould be adopted without a vote by this Assembly in\r\nthe time frame you have indicated.\r\nMr. Mubarez (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I wish to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report on strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations (A/57/387). Having read the entire\r\nreport, we believe that the Secretariat has the\r\nenthusiasm and the vision to pursue the necessary\r\nreforms that began five years ago.\r\nThe vitality of the debate and the broad\r\nparticipation in it reflect the importance that Member\r\nStates attach to the issue of the desired reforms, which\r\nin turn reflects an increasing recognition of the\r\nmagnitude of the challenges we face today and our\r\ncollective conviction regarding the role of the United\r\nNations as a centre for international decision-making\r\nand for realizing the collective will. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration not only defines the goals and the direction\r\nof our future work, but also identifies an effective role\r\nfor the Organization now and in the future.\r\nIt is well known that our noble objective is the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. It is\r\nalso common knowledge that peace will not prevail\r\nunless it is based on justice and equity, be it in the\r\nareas of security and sovereignty or in that of the\r\ndistribution of resources and well-being.\r\nThe delegation of Yemen has spoken already on\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the\r\nOrganization (A/57/1). We support the further\r\nmeasures the Secretary-General has proposed in the\r\nreport (A/57/387) before us today. We cannot now go\r\ninto detail on all the proposals contained in the report,\r\nbut we would like to state that the nature of the\r\nchallenges we face and the interrelation among our\r\nshared interests in this era of globalization make it\r\nimperative to strengthen the role and effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations as an institution for multilateral\r\ninternational endeavour. At the same time, we consider\r\nattempts to form alliances outside the context of this\r\nOrganization to contravene the Millennium Declaration\r\nand the objective of achieving democracy in\r\ninternational relations.\r\nWe wish to address in particular issues related to\r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council.\r\nReform means correcting the mistakes of the past. We\r\nagree with the Secretary-General’s report that the role\r\nof the General Assembly in the work of the United\r\nNations is diminishing. That is a shortcoming that must\r\nbe corrected. For our part, we support all efforts to\r\nrevitalize the General Assembly and, Mr. President, we\r\nhail your personal efforts. We also consider that the\r\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council is\r\nan issue upon which we all agree. It is one of the most\r\nimportant reforms that must be carried out.\r\nWe wish to emphasize what the representative of\r\nVenezuela said on behalf of the Group of 77 and China:\r\nthat reform of the Organization should target, first and\r\nforemost, the development needs of developing\r\nnations. This makes it imperative that the activities of\r\nthe components of the Organization, including the\r\nDepartment of Public Information, be directed to that\r\nend. Here, we must emphasize the need to strengthen\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nUnited Nations information centres in developing\r\nnations, because those nations lack information\r\ntechnology and modern media. Among the areas that\r\nneed that support are the Arab countries, where\r\nintensive information activities are needed to correct\r\nthe image of the United Nations within Arab public\r\nopinion and explain its role in working for the benefit\r\nof one and all. We still believe that the United Nations\r\nInformation Centre in Sana’a can perform that task if it\r\nis strengthened and supported.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations needs\r\nnew blood and new ideas that will open opportunities\r\nto the young people of the developing countries and\r\nenable them to assume positions in the international\r\ncivil service. This will contribute to the principle of\r\nequitable geographical distribution in the United\r\nNations employment policies, which have yet to be\r\nimplemented, and to attain the required universality.\r\nWe wish to assure you, Sir, that the delegation of\r\nthe Republic of Yemen remains ready to participate in\r\nall consultations on any views and proposals that will\r\nhelp to strengthen our Organization and enable it to\r\nperform its role in guiding and forming international\r\nrelations, in consonance with the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter.\r\nMr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): My delegation thanks the Secretary-General\r\nfor submitting the report entitled “Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations: an agenda for further change”. We\r\nappreciate his interest in strengthening the work of the\r\nOrganization in response to the priorities enshrined in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration.\r\nWe share the Secretary-General’s view that there\r\nis a need for a multilateral institution devoted to the\r\nservice of humankind as a whole. That need has never\r\nbeen more urgent than it is in this age of globalization.\r\nNeedless to say, keeping our methods of work under\r\nconstant review is essential so that we may benefit\r\nfrom experience, allowing us to correct past mistakes\r\nand to enhance the methods used to implement the\r\ngoals of the United Nations. The reform of the Security\r\nCouncil and the strengthening of the role of the\r\nGeneral Assembly fall into this same context.\r\nThe report is of special importance, addressing as\r\nit does the strengthening of the United Nations as a\r\nwhole. It is an ambitious programme that allows us to\r\nhope that we will be able to strengthen and improve the\r\nOrganization’s mechanisms of work with a view to its\r\nimplementation of the letter and spirit of the Charter\r\nand to its ability to respond to the challenges outlined\r\nin the Millennium Declaration and to apply the relevant\r\nlegislative mandates in all its tasks.\r\nThere is no doubt that this great ambition requires\r\nthe revitalization of the process of Security Council\r\nreform in order to make it more democratic. It further\r\nrequires the establishment of new frameworks in the\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and its\r\nspecialized agencies, bodies, organizations,\r\nprogrammes and funds, as well as the strengthening of\r\nthe central role of the General Assembly. It requires\r\neffective mechanisms for implementation that would\r\nenable the General Assembly and the Economic and\r\nSocial Council, among other United Nations bodies, to\r\nfollow up on the implementation of their\r\nrecommendations.\r\nIn the light of all this, my delegation wishes to\r\noffer brief comments on the report before us, since the\r\nreport addresses a number of important issues and\r\nmakes a number of proposals that the General\r\nAssembly should consider and engage with. The report\r\nis rich in information and the issues it tackles are\r\ndiverse. It raises a number of questions to which the\r\nrepresentative of Venezuela referred in his statement on\r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nIt would be useful to us to know what is required\r\nof the General Assembly in the light of the points\r\nraised in the report, some of which require the\r\nSecretary-General’s approval or fall under his\r\ncompetence, while others are in the purview of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Informal consultations will\r\nundoubtedly help to clarify for delegations those\r\nquestions that were raised during the debate on the\r\nreport, including those raised by the Group of 77 and\r\nChina.\r\nIt can be said that the necessary measures are\r\nconfined to issues which the Main Committees of the\r\nGeneral Assembly are accustomed to addressing. The\r\ndiscussion of most of these issues is generally carried\r\nout in the Advisory Committee on Administrative and\r\nBudgetary Questions. A number of other proposed\r\nsteps relate to the work of the Second, Third and\r\nFourth Committees. It would seem useful to us in this\r\ncontext to seek to benefit from the accrued expertise\r\nand experience of those Committees. It would also be\r\nmeaningful to build on prior achievements with a view\r\nto strengthening the current legislative mandates.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nMy delegation would like to make a number of\r\ngeneral observations on some points raised in the\r\nreport.\r\nFirst, with respect to the promotion of the\r\nDepartment of Public Information, the report highlights\r\nthe ambitious goals of that Department to reach the\r\nlargest possible global audience. We stress the\r\nnecessity of achieving parity on the Internet among the\r\nsix official languages of the Organization. This would\r\nallow us to achieve the goal of reaching the broadest\r\npossible audience and enable the Organization to\r\nspread its message, in implementation of many United\r\nNations resolutions.\r\nSecondly, with respect to publications and the\r\nwork of the Department of General Assembly Affairs\r\nand Conference Management, my delegation believes\r\nthat the management of meetings is an entitlement of\r\nthe Member States and not of the Secretariat. We\r\nemphasize the need for the publications and\r\ndocumentation of the United Nations to reach the\r\nMember States in the six official languages. They must\r\nbe distributed simultaneously and in a timely manner,\r\nin accordance with current legislative mandates. I note\r\nthe leading role played by the Department in\r\npreserving the institutional memory of the Organization\r\nand in disseminating hard-copy reports in the six\r\nofficial languages of the Organization. This allows\r\ndelegations, particularly the smaller ones, to engage\r\nwith the Secretary-General’s proposals and to interact\r\nwith the intergovernmental bodies, since most such\r\nreports are the bases of negotiations between\r\ndelegations.\r\nThirdly, my delegation believes that the\r\nestablishment of an additional position of Assistant\r\nSecretary-General to support policy coherence and\r\nmanagement in the Department of Economic and\r\nSocial Affairs is worthy of our support.\r\nFourthly, the medium-term plan is the framework\r\nthat allows us to examine the Organization’s policies\r\nand their implementation. A four-year time frame\r\nwould be more effective for coordinating those\r\npolicies. A detailed, transparent budget would help to\r\nensure that funding of the programmes is in line with\r\nlegislative policies and mandates. My delegation would\r\nlike to stress the important role played by the\r\nCommittee for Programme Coordination in examining\r\nthe policies of the Organization and in ensuring\r\ncoordination and funding of legislative mandates.\r\nAllow me to indicate that the sunset provisions\r\nmentioned in paragraph 44 of the report — which\r\nstates the need to examine initiatives with major\r\nfinancial implications and to apply sunset provisions to\r\nthem — make us wonder whether or not the eradication\r\nof poverty is one of the Organization’s main priorities.\r\nThe Organization’s survival depends on the\r\nachievement of its goals, and one of its main goals is\r\neradication of poverty. Revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly hinges upon that concept.\r\nFifthly, as to human resources management, my\r\ndelegation believes that the United Nations staff is the\r\nOrganization’s most valuable asset. We emphasize the\r\nneed to benefit from what has been achieved in\r\nreforming the management of human resources, and to\r\ntake into account the points of view of the staff in that\r\nmatter. The Secretary-General is right that the\r\nprinciples and the system of internal justice must be\r\nstrengthened. We must close the loophole created by\r\nsuppression of the role of the International Court of\r\nJustice as an appeals court for the United Nations staff.\r\nIt is vital to close that loophole. Increased scope for\r\ndelegation of authority makes it necessary to\r\nstrengthen accountability.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe the important  issues\r\nraised by the Secretary-General in his report require\r\nconstructive interaction through broadened\r\nexamination and in-depth reflection, and will benefit\r\nfrom the invaluable clarifications which the Secretariat\r\nwill provide us during our informal consultations on\r\nthe item.\r\nMr. Ortiz Gandarillas (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The item we are discussing today is\r\nextremely important. The strengthening of the United\r\nNations should be a constant element in the concern,\r\nthe action and the responsibility of the international\r\ncommunity and, in particular, of every Member State,\r\nlarge or small, represented in this great Assembly.\r\nThe United Nations is the premier world forum\r\nfor the discussion of major problems affecting mankind\r\nas a whole as well as individuals. The complex and\r\ndelicate questions of international peace and security;\r\nthe liberation of peoples and nations; the creation and\r\nformation of new States in the process of\r\ndecolonization; the efforts to improve the social and\r\neconomic situation of millions of human beings; the\r\npromotion of human rights; development; the\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nprotection of the environment: all these have for some\r\ntime been on the political agenda of the Organization.\r\nEach year, the Assembly conducts an assessment\r\nof the work of the Organization through the report of\r\nthe Secretary-General (see A/57/1). The outcome of\r\nthat assessment has been mixed, as we saw in the\r\nrecent debate on that item. Although this assessment is\r\npartial, fragmented and subjective, we have seen\r\npositive and concrete progress in the work of the\r\nOrganization, in the areas such as peacekeeping\r\noperations — which earned the Nobel Peace Prize; the\r\nestablishment of the State of Timor-Leste under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations and its accession to\r\nmembership of the Organization; the holding of the\r\nMillennium Summit and the Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg summits. These are clear examples of\r\nachievements of the Organization that we can mention\r\nas sources of great satisfaction.\r\nHowever, there are also reasons to be somewhat\r\ndissatisfied. We need only mention the problems of\r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nIn terms of time, we have entered a new century\r\nand a new millennium. In terms of space, we have\r\nentered the era of globalization. We have a new\r\ncontext, where the old unresolved problems have\r\nworsened and taken on a global dimension, becoming\r\nat the same time formidable new challenges.\r\nThe sustainability and strengthening of\r\ndemocracies; respect for international law; the\r\npromotion, respect and full observance of human,\r\npolitical, economic and cultural rights: these are crucial\r\nfor better peaceful coexistence. We see extreme\r\npoverty at the global level; it is no longer acceptable to\r\nthe international community. Enormous inequalities in\r\naccess to the benefits of economic, trade, financial and\r\ntechnological activities have also increased and have\r\nworsened both nationally and internationally, bordering\r\non the unacceptable. The deterioration of every aspect\r\nof our environment is intolerable.\r\nIf that were not enough, in this process of\r\nglobalization we have seen the emergence of new\r\nthreats: international crime, terrorism, the illicit\r\ntrafficking of arms and drugs, and the rise of diseases\r\nsuch as HIV/AIDS and malaria. Technological\r\nadvances, paradoxically, have opened a new and wider\r\ngap between those who possess information and\r\nknowledge and the dispossessed. Combined with all of\r\nthis, we have changes and crises in the economies of\r\ndeveloping countries as a result of globalization, which\r\nin many cases has threatened to further widen already\r\nexisting social inequalities.\r\nThe current situation of the world in which we\r\nlive and its prospects for the future are not at all\r\npromising. On the contrary, we can say they are\r\nuncertain and dramatic. Allow me to mention three\r\nspecific examples. With regard to the lack of food and\r\nsecurity, according to the latest statistics of the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n(FAO), 840 million people in the world are\r\nmalnourished. This means that 11 million people in\r\nindustrialized countries, 30 million in the countries in\r\ntransition and 799 million in developing countries\r\nsuffer chronic hunger. Of these, 6 million children\r\nunder the age of five die each year.\r\nAnother example with respect to health, the\r\nSeptember-October 2002 edition of “Population 2005”,\r\nquotes a United Nations report on the global\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic as saying that over the next 20\r\nyears, 70 million people will die of AIDS. As a third\r\nexample, on the distribution of wealth in the world, 14\r\nper cent of the world population, concentrated in the\r\ndeveloped countries, produce and consume 75 per cent\r\nof the world product, while the remaining 86 per cent\r\nare responsible for the other 25 per cent. Those\r\nstatistics are very illustrative and need no further\r\ncommentary.\r\nThose are only a few of the real problems facing\r\nthe United Nations and the international community. It\r\nis against that background that we must ask ourselves\r\nwhether our Organization has the capacity necessary to\r\ntackle such problems and challenges. I am afraid that\r\nthe answer would be, in general “no”, with some\r\nworthy exceptions. We are sure that this situation is at\r\nthe heart of the concerns of the Secretary-General and\r\nof the Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General is now proposing a new\r\nresponse through his report entitled “Strengthening of\r\nthe United Nations: an agenda for further change”\r\n(A/57/387 and Corr.1). Here, we wish to express our\r\nsincere appreciation and support for the efforts and\r\ngoals of the Secretary-General to strengthen the\r\nOrganization. The report proposes a set of actions and\r\nmeasures which, in the opinion of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, are practical and pragmatic. They appear\r\nmodest if considered separately, but they could have\r\ngreater impact if taken as a whole.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nAt the present time, our delegation will not make\r\nany observations or an assessment of the actions and\r\nmeasures proposed because of the doubts we still have\r\non their scope, some of their implications, their means\r\nof implementation and on the cost versus benefits. We\r\nare certain that those doubts will be clarified in the\r\ncourse of the informal consultations following this\r\ndebate. In that respect, we support the statement of the\r\nGroup of 77.\r\nNevertheless, we would like to make a few\r\ncomments on how we view this reform proposal in\r\ngeneral. We believe, perhaps a little empirically and\r\nsubjectively, that the proposals are somewhat modest,\r\nespecially when measured against the problems and\r\nchallenges faced by the Organization in the real world\r\nin which we live. We also see that these definitely\r\nvaluable proposals are designed to improve the internal\r\noperation of the Organization. Of course, it is very\r\nimportant, above all else, to put our house in order. As\r\nthe report states, the reform is a programme to further\r\nchange and to adapt the internal structure and the\r\nmentality of the United Nations to new expectations\r\nand challenges.\r\nIn this process of new reforms, we would have\r\nliked to see more clearly how to strengthen the external\r\noperation of the Organization so that it can improve\r\nand extend its reach throughout the world. We believe\r\nthat the Organization has a very important role to play\r\nin events on the world stage, along with other actors,\r\nStates and other international institutions, such as the\r\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization. Here, we are referring\r\nparticularly to the process of globalization, which is\r\nshaping a new world characterized by the supremacy of\r\nthe interests of multinational corporations, which have\r\na mercantilist vision of trade relations, investment and\r\nscientific and technical knowledge. We know that this\r\nprocess is affecting and changing the behaviour of\r\nsocieties at all levels — even the most remote\r\nsocieties — as well as the behaviour of actors on the\r\ninternational stage, including the United Nations, with\r\nall the positive and negative risks and consequences\r\nthat the process of globalization entails.\r\nBut we also believe that the United Nations must\r\nassume a leadership role and have a greater presence\r\non the world stage. It must be capable of influencing,\r\nimpacting and even shaping the process of\r\nglobalization in order to make it more human and more\r\nresponsible towards the basic and social needs of\r\nmillions of human beings. We agree with the\r\nobservation of the European Union, also cited by the\r\nAmbassador of Singapore: “The ultimate aim of our\r\nwork in the United Nations is to make the world a\r\nbetter place for the poor people of the planet.”\r\n(A/57/PV.38)\r\nIn this regard, with due respect, we disagree with\r\nthe Ambassador of Singapore. It is not through the\r\nallocation of the budget of the Organization that we are\r\ngoing to help create the conditions for a better world.\r\nWe are convinced that it is through compliance with\r\nthe commitments pledged by the Member States of the\r\nOrganization that the world will start to change for the\r\nbetter.\r\nIn this context, we believe that the Organization\r\nshould also have an agenda for change towards the\r\nworld. Allow me to give an example. The Organization\r\nhas the mandate to follow up the implementation of the\r\ngoals and achievements of the Millennium Summit, the\r\nMonterrey Conference and the Johannesburg Summit.\r\nBut we believe that mere follow-up is not enough. The\r\nOrganization, in a practical and pragmatic spirit, can\r\nand must also carry out an effort to promote —\r\nlobbying, as they say — compliance with those\r\ncommitments. There should be a visible leadership\r\nfigure responsible for this work, who can be described\r\nas creating awareness at the highest level, as well as at\r\na personal level, among the political leaders of States.\r\nThe United Nations is in a privileged position because\r\nit possesses great moral authority and a strong sense of\r\nsocial justice.\r\nWe wish to conclude by reiterating our\r\nappreciation and support for the Secretary-General’s\r\nefforts to strengthen our Organization, and we reiterate\r\nour commitment to participating in the consultations in\r\na constructive spirit of solidarity.\r\nThe President: We have just heard the last\r\nspeaker in the plenary debate on agenda item 52 on\r\nstrengthening of the United Nations system.\r\nBefore I adjourn the meeting, let me make some\r\nconcluding remarks. First, I would like to thank all of\r\nyou who have participated in the debate for your\r\nattentive and thoughtful observations. It was a very\r\nrich and interesting debate. We have listened to 71\r\nstatements, with various views and numerous\r\nconstructive and well-grounded suggestions.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nDespite the diversity of comments, almost all\r\nstatements have had many points in common. I would\r\nlike to summarize briefly some of the points that\r\nprevailed in many speeches. It seems to me that we\r\nhave already found a common ground of understanding\r\nwhich could serve us a starting point for the upcoming\r\ninformal consultations. I have heard strong support, for\r\nexample, for the following perceptions. There is\r\nappreciation of the Secretary-General for coming\r\nforward with a comprehensive set of new reform\r\nproposals and for his continuing effort in making the\r\nUnited Nations more productive, efficient and\r\neffective.\r\nSecondly, there is recognition of the need for a\r\nholistic approach towards all agenda items related to\r\nUnited Nations reform — namely, revitalization of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and the integrated follow-up on\r\nglobal conferences — so that the changes that are being\r\nintroduced under various agenda items complement\r\none another and pull together in the same direction.\r\nThirdly, the United Nations development agenda\r\nclearly remains at the centre of the work of the United\r\nNations, and the next programme budget would better\r\nreflect the priorities agreed upon at the Millennium\r\nAssembly as well as at other United Nations\r\nconferences.\r\nFourthly, the implementation plan to strengthen\r\nthe effectiveness of the Organization’s presence in\r\ndeveloping countries was generally welcomed.\r\nLastly — and I am giving only a few examples —\r\ngeneral agreement was also expressed with regard to\r\nproceeding with reform measures that are within the\r\ncompetence of the Secretary-General. I was\r\nparticularly pleased to realize, first, that it will not\r\nnecessarily be difficult to formulate an agreed position\r\namong Member States concerning many proposals put\r\nforward by the Secretary-General for which\r\nauthorization by the General Assembly is needed, and\r\nsecondly, that all delegations that expressed their\r\nconcerns and reservations with regard to some of the\r\nproposed actions did so in a constructive manner. That\r\nleads me to believe that we have a constructive process\r\nof consultations and negotiations before us.\r\nAs I promised at the beginning of this debate, I\r\nshould now like to advise the Assembly that I have\r\nappointed Mr. Abdul Mejid Hussein, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Ethiopia, to assist me in leading the\r\nprocess of informal consultation. Moreover, we will be\r\nassisted by the following Facilitators: Mr. Movses\r\nAbelian, Permanent Representative of Armenia; Mr.\r\nIftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, Permanent Representative\r\nof Bangladesh; Mr. Luis Gallegos Chiriboga,\r\nPermanent Representative of Ecuador; Mr. Denis\r\nDangue Réwaka, Permanent Representative of Gabon;\r\nMr. Mochamad Slamet Hidayat, Chargé d’Affaires of\r\nIndonesia; Mr. Stafford O. Neil, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Jamaica; Mr. Mohamed Bennouna,\r\nPermanent Representative of the Kingdom of Morocco;\r\nMr. Dirk Jan van den Berg, Permanent Representative\r\nof the Netherlands; Mr. Don MacKay, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of New Zealand; and Mr. Munir Akram,\r\nPermanent Representative of Pakistan.\r\nThey all kindly agreed to facilitate\r\ncommunication between the presidency and the\r\nmembership during the process of informal\r\nconsultations and negotiations on resolutions through\r\nwhat I would call very informal outreach and, beyond\r\nany formal structures, they will work towards a kind of\r\nexpanded transparency. Each delegation can, of course,\r\ncontact any of the Facilitators I have just mentioned —\r\nregardless of region or subregion — and share with\r\nhim its concerns, ideas and suggestions at any time. I\r\nhave clearly asked the Facilitators to conduct as many\r\nvoluntary consultations with Member States as\r\npossible. I should like to stress that they will not stand\r\nbetween Members and myself — quite the contrary.\r\nThey will assist me and the Vice-Presidents in learning\r\nabout as many of your ideas as possible, and they will\r\nenable us to learn more about your suggestions than we\r\ncould find out relying 24 hours a day on our own\r\nhuman capacity.\r\nI should like to announce that the open-ended\r\ninformal consultations will begin on Monday\r\nafternoon, 4 November, when we shall consider the\r\nissues of public information, development and social\r\nand economic issues. That will be the first item, and I\r\nam referring here to issues under Chapter II (a) and (c),\r\nto those under all of Chapter III and to those under\r\nChapter IV (a) and (b). Essentially, we shall deal with\r\nproposed actions 1 and 6-18 on Monday. The informal\r\nconsultations that will follow are scheduled for\r\nWednesday and Friday. I shall announce on Monday\r\nthe themes to be discussed Wednesday and Friday, but\r\nbe assured that we shall cover all of the themes raised\r\nduring the plenary debate and in Members’ submitted\r\nquestions.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.42\r\nI have listened to Members’ statements very\r\ncarefully. On the basis of those statements — and also,\r\nof course, on the interventions to be made during the\r\nforthcoming informal consultations — I plan to submit\r\nthe first draft of the resolution, which will reflect the\r\nviews of Members, shortly after mid-November. I\r\nshould like to reiterate that the process will be open\r\nand transparent, and that the informal consultations\r\nwill continue for as long as necessary. I should also\r\nlike to assure Members that my own door will remain\r\nopen to everyone during the entire process. I am\r\ngenuinely looking forward to your close cooperation,\r\nwhich I believe will yield a good resolution.\r\nLet me repeat my conviction — expressed at the\r\nbeginning of this debate — that we should be able to\r\nagree on this resolution before Christmas, so that next\r\nyear we can concentrate on some of the more detailed\r\nwork that will need to be carried out by experts in their\r\nrespective Committees.\r\nBefore I adjourn the meeting, I should like to\r\nmake an announcement regarding an addition to the\r\nprogramme of work for the plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on Monday morning, 4 November.\r\nThe Assembly will consider, as the third item, sub-item\r\n(a) of agenda item 41, “Final review and appraisal of\r\nthe implementation of the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s”, in order\r\nto take action on a draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/57/468/Add.1, recommended by the Ad\r\nHoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly\r\nfor the Final Review and Appraisal of the\r\nImplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this\r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 52.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.\r\n"
