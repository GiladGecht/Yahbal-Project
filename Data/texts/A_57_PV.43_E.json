(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 16\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and\r\nother elections: election of twenty members of the\r\nCommittee for Programme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/57/428,\r\nA/57/428/Add.1)\r\nThe President: Pursuant to General Assembly\r\ndecision 42/450 of 17 December 1987, the Assembly\r\nelects the members of the Committee for Programme\r\nand Coordination upon their nomination by the\r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/57/428\r\nand addendum 1, which contains the nominations by\r\nthe Economic and Social Council to fill the vacancies\r\nin the Committee that will occur as a result of the\r\nexpiration, on 31 December 2002, of the terms of\r\noffice of Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cameroon,\r\nCuba, Gabon, Germany, Indonesia, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Italy, Mauritania, Pakistan, Peru,\r\nPoland, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, San\r\nMarino, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\nand Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe.\r\nThose States are eligible for immediate re-\r\nelection.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1\r\nJanuary 2003, the following States will still be\r\nmembers of the Committee: the Bahamas, Botswana,\r\nChina, Ethiopia, France, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Tunisia, the\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, the United States of\r\nAmerica and Uruguay.\r\nTherefore, those 14 States are not eligible in this\r\nelection.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the\r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic\r\nand Social Council: the four African States for four\r\nvacancies are Benin, the Central African Republic,\r\nGabon and South Africa; the four Asian States for four\r\nvacancies are India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran and Pakistan; the three Eastern European States\r\nfor three vacancies are Armenia, the Republic of\r\nMoldova and Ukraine; the four Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States for four vacancies are Argentina,\r\nBrazil, Cuba and Nicaragua; and the four Western\r\nEuropean and other States for five vacancies are\r\nGermany, Monaco, Switzerland and the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot,\r\nand there shall be no nominations. However, I should\r\nlike to recall paragraph 16 of General Assembly\r\ndecision 34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing\r\nwith the secret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs\r\nwhen the number of candidates corresponds to the\r\nnumber of seats to be filled should become standard,\r\nunless a delegation specifically requests a vote on a\r\ngiven election.\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that\r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on that\r\nbasis?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The number of States nominated\r\nfrom among the African States, the Asian States, the\r\nEastern European States, the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States and the Western European and other\r\nStates is equal to, or does not exceed, the number of\r\nseats to be filled in each of those groups.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto declare those States nominated by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council from among the African States, the\r\nAsian States, the Eastern European States, the Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and the Western\r\nEuropean and other States, namely Argentina,\r\nArmenia, Benin, Brazil, the Central African Republic,\r\nCuba, Gabon, Germany, India, Indonesia, the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran, Monaco, Nicaragua, Pakistan, the\r\nRepublic of Moldova, South Africa, Switzerland,\r\nUkraine and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, elected members of the Committee\r\nfor Programme and Coordination for a three-year term\r\nof office beginning on 1 January 2003?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the 19 States that\r\nhave been elected members of the Committee for\r\nProgramme and Coordination.\r\nRegarding the remaining vacancy from among the\r\nWestern European and other States, the General\r\nAssembly will be in a position to act on it upon the\r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council of a\r\nMember State from that region.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 16.\r\nAgenda item 24\r\nCulture of peace\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/57/186 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/57/L.9/Rev.1 and\r\nA/57/L.12)\r\nThe President: The note by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral transmitting the report of the Director-General\r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization has been circulated in document\r\nA/57/186 and addendum 1.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of\r\nBangladesh to introduce draft resolution A/57/L.9.\r\nMr. Chowdhury (Bangladesh): Mr. President,\r\nonce again I should like to put on record my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation of your excellent leadership\r\nof this Assembly through your prodigious wisdom,\r\nknowledge and skill. My delegation is committed to\r\nworking closely with you and other delegations to\r\nensure that the current Assembly session reaches the\r\nfruitful conclusion to which we all aspire.\r\n I now have the pleasure and the honour to present\r\nto the Assembly draft resolution A/57/L.9, entitled\r\n“International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010”,\r\nunder agenda item 24, Culture of peace. Traditionally,\r\nthis draft resolution has been tabled by Bangladesh and\r\nco-sponsored by a large number of countries from all\r\nparts of the world.\r\nIn addition to the list of sponsors that has been\r\nprovided in the draft resolution this time around,\r\nMorocco and Venezuela have also signed up. The list is\r\nstill available; it is with the Secretariat at the side of\r\nthis Hall; and we would welcome others who may wish\r\nto join us.\r\nI hope that all delegations have had a chance to\r\nexamine the draft resolution. There is very little that is\r\nnew in the present formulation. Basically, we have\r\nfollowed the usual pattern of recalling relevant\r\nprevious resolutions, noting significant new\r\ndevelopments over the last year, commending Member\r\ncountries, the United Nations system, organizations and\r\ncivil society for their work in the area of culture of\r\npeace and calling on them to further strengthen their\r\nactivities.\r\nWe have also recognized the very important work\r\nbeing done by the United Nations system and the\r\ninternational community in the fields of peacekeeping,\r\npeace-building, conflict prevention, disarmament,\r\nsustainable development, promotion of human dignity\r\nand human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good\r\ngovernance at all levels. These contribute greatly to the\r\npromotion of the culture of peace.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nOver several sessions of informal consultations,\r\nan agreed text has been achieved among participants\r\nfrom over 50 countries, representing different groups\r\nand shades of opinion. The agreed text was circulated\r\nby the Secretariat this morning as document\r\nA/57/L.9/Rev.1.\r\nOf particular note is the reference in operative\r\nparagraph 11 to the decision contained in operative\r\nparagraph 13 of General Assembly resolution 55/47\r\nthat one day of plenary meetings should be devoted\r\nduring the sixtieth session of the Assembly to\r\nconsidering the item. While emphasizing the\r\nsignificance of these planned meetings in marking the\r\nhalfway point in the observance of the Decade and\r\ncalling for high-level participation, the Assembly is\r\ncalled upon to consider, at an appropriate time, the\r\npossibility of organizing these meetings as close as\r\npossible to the general debate.\r\nThere is also a new operative paragraph 5, which\r\ncalls on the appropriate authorities to provide\r\neducation in children’s schools that includes lessons in\r\nmutual understanding, tolerance, active citizenship,\r\nhuman rights and the promotion of the culture of peace.\r\nI hope that this Assembly will adopt the draft\r\nresolution by consensus, as it has done in the past, as a\r\nreflection of what we believe are the aspirations of\r\nhumanity in our contemporary times.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of El Salvador, who will speak on behalf\r\nof the Central American countries and the Dominican\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Lagos Pizzati (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): My delegation is pleased to be able to\r\nparticipate in the debate on agenda item 24, entitled\r\n“Culture of peace”, on behalf of the countries members\r\nof the Central American Group and of the Dominican\r\nRepublic. Consideration of this item is particularly\r\nrelevant today, at a time when the international\r\ncommunity is facing a tense and difficult conflict\r\nsituation, and also because of the potentially negative\r\nconsequences of abandoning collective action as a\r\nmeans of promoting and maintaining international\r\npeace and security. A culture of peace is today more\r\nimportant than ever.\r\nIn fact, as a result of the attacks of 11 September\r\n2001 and of the other terrorist acts which have given\r\nrise to a worldwide fight against terrorism, the\r\ninternational political situation has deteriorated,\r\nthreatening multilateral mechanisms for the promotion\r\nand maintenance of international peace and security\r\nand thus running the risk of bringing about serious\r\npolitical, economic and social destabilization in the\r\nentire Middle East region, which undeniably would\r\neventually affect the entire world.\r\nEfforts to give new impetus to and urgently and\r\nactively promote the consolidation of a culture of peace\r\nare thus essential at this time.\r\nGiven that the General Assembly has declared the\r\nperiod 2001-2010 as the International Decade for the\r\nCulture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of\r\nthe World, we now have an invaluable opportunity to\r\nconvey a message of hope to our peoples, despite the\r\nadverse circumstances that threaten to make violence\r\nmore widespread and extensive as an accepted —\r\nthough undesirable — part of daily life.\r\nAs is well known, the culture of peace represents\r\nabove all a general effort to change ways of thinking\r\nand attitudes with a view to promoting peace. It means\r\ntransforming and preventing conflicts so as to ensure\r\nthat they do not lead to further violence and re-\r\nestablishing peace and trust among our citizens.\r\nIn this regard, the countries of Central America\r\nand the Dominican Republic share the view that a\r\nculture of peace must be built up day by day. That is\r\nwhy our Governments believe that adopting values and\r\nattitudes that promote peace is first and foremost a\r\npersonal decision, but that it becomes more significant\r\nwhen expressed collectively. The will to establish a\r\ndialogue, to share, to express solidarity, to listen to the\r\nviews and accept the ideas of others — even though\r\none might not agree with them — and to be\r\nunderstanding and tolerant, must come from within, as\r\nthe result of personal reflection about how to be a\r\npeace-builder, before taking root in the collective\r\nconscience of our peoples.\r\nIn this respect, the International Year for the\r\nCulture of Peace, commemorated in 2000, provided an\r\nexcellent opportunity for the promotion of a personal,\r\ncollective and institutional attitude adjustment. This\r\nmanifested itself in a number of activities carried out\r\nby civil society, Governments, the United Nations\r\nsystem and other relevant stakeholders interested in\r\nactively promoting a culture of peace.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nIt is also important to emphasize that the desire\r\nfor peace is one that is universally recognized. It has\r\nbeen expressed and demonstrated throughout history, in\r\ndocuments and activities that are deeply rooted in\r\nhuman culture.\r\nPeace, as a human aspiration and need, does not\r\nonly mean a reduction in all types of violence, whether\r\ndirect, structural or cultural. It is also an indispensable\r\nprecondition for the creative and non-violent\r\ntransformation of conflict in a way that contributes to\r\npeace-building, to the extent that we are capable of\r\nchanging conflict into cooperation, positively and\r\ncreatively acknowledging our opponents by means of\r\ndialogue.\r\nIn this respect, it is important to note that peace is\r\nmultidimensional and therefore calls for efforts to be\r\nmade to achieve not only disarmament but true human\r\ndevelopment and to consolidate respect for human\r\nrights, resolve conflict and put an end to environmental\r\ndegradation.\r\nThe countries of Central America and the\r\nDominican Republic share the view that the right of\r\nhuman beings to live in peace is the cornerstone for all\r\nother rights. Peace being a human right, it behoves all\r\nof us to be peace-builders. To contribute to the building\r\nof a new vision of peace through the development of a\r\nculture of peace based on the universal values of\r\ndemocracy, respect for life, freedom, justice, solidarity,\r\ntolerance, human rights and equality between men and\r\nwomen is thus one of the most important tasks and\r\nchallenges of our times.\r\nIt is the responsibility of all to become aware of\r\nthe common destiny of humankind so as to promote the\r\nimplementation of common policies to guarantee\r\njustice in relations among human beings, as well as\r\nsupport harmonious relationships between humankind\r\nand the environment and among States.\r\nIt is thus more important than ever today to build\r\npeace through science, culture, education,\r\ncommunication and solidarity, so as to effectively face\r\nup to the challenges of exclusion, discrimination,\r\nintolerance and violence, which threaten the cohesion\r\nof societies and inevitably lead to armed conflict.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating the\r\ninvitation of the countries of Central America and the\r\nDominican Republic to join together in building and\r\nconsolidating a culture of peace. Now is the time to\r\ntransform a culture of confrontation and violence into a\r\nculture of peace.\r\nMs. Khakamada (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): I am speaking to the General Assembly today\r\non behalf of the delegation of the Russian Federation in\r\nmy capacity as Deputy Chairperson of the State Duma\r\nof the Russian Federation and as one of the leaders of\r\nthe Democratic Party in Russia. Furthermore, I was one\r\nof the people who personally communicated and\r\nnegotiated with the terrorists who recently took more\r\nthan 700 people hostage in the centre of Moscow. For\r\nthat reason, my words today may seem harsh: I am not\r\nonly aware of the new challenges to international\r\nsecurity, but have actually looked them in the face. For\r\nme and for all those who have suffered from terrorist\r\nacts, the question of the culture of peace is not just\r\nempty words.\r\nAfter 11 September 2001, it was generally\r\nadmitted that the world had changed, but only now has\r\nthe global crisis of foreign policy thinking become\r\napparent. It is now clear that, in the 10 years since the\r\nbreak-up of the Soviet Union, the world’s developed\r\ncountries, headed by the United States, were preparing\r\nfor illusory challenges and were thus unprepared to\r\nface the real threats.\r\nWhen, following the tragedy in New York,\r\nemotions abated, it was clear that the crisis of decision-\r\nmaking on security policies had itself become one of\r\nthe principal threats to the world today. It has even\r\nbeen said that conventional thinking on foreign policy\r\nhas been revived. The question therefore arises as to\r\nwhether there is a place for the culture of peace in\r\nmodern politics. Can we speak about a compatibility\r\nbetween war — that is, the war against terrorism —\r\nand the culture of peace?\r\nMany Western leaders have decided that peace\r\nenforcement is the most effective way to maintain\r\nsecurity. If that idea is accepted, however, the\r\nemergence of quasi-colonialism is almost inevitable\r\nand will have unpredictable consequences.\r\nNobody would argue that it is not necessary to\r\ntake prompt coercive measures against terrorist\r\norganizations and the financial structures that support\r\nthem. But it is important in that respect to ensure that\r\nwe have the information that we need in order to\r\nprevent acts of terrorism, since preventing them is\r\nmuch easier than dealing with their tragic\r\nconsequences after they have claimed civilian victims.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nIt would be dangerous, however, to draw parallels\r\nbetween terror and the peculiarities of a given political\r\nregime.\r\nAfter all, political dictatorship and terrorism are\r\ntwo different things, no matter how we regard them.\r\nThat distinction is needed in order to block ideological\r\nsupport for international terrorism. Terrorism must not\r\nbe associated with any particular State, nationality or\r\nreligion. Terrorists should be considered worldwide as\r\noutlaws who exist independently of any political\r\nregime. Otherwise, international terrorism will use\r\ninter-ethnic and religious conflict as an ideological\r\nbasis for its action aimed at breaking down civilization\r\nand will thereby gain additional resources. I believe it\r\nis necessary to effect radical and immediate reforms of\r\nthe United Nations right away, rather than to think in\r\nterms of the clash of civilizations, which makes the\r\ninternational security system even more vulnerable.\r\nOn the other hand, we cannot accuse Western\r\ncountries of pursuing a one-sided power policy. For\r\nthem, the ideals of freedom and democracy do not\r\nsound a hollow note but are an actual integral part of\r\ntheir policies aimed at spreading the ideals of human\r\nrights and human values. At the same time, we cannot\r\nreplace the struggle for human values with the struggle\r\nfor national interests or to confuse national interests\r\nwith the basic principles of international security.\r\nWe believe that, in these conditions, the world\r\ncommunity needs to react much quicker. I think that\r\nthere is no time for delay or for long-drawn-out\r\ndecisions. Disproportionate response on the part of\r\nworld terrorism is possible, and the threat of such a\r\nresponse remains. Such a situation is further\r\ncomplicated by the fact that the United Nations is\r\nlosing its importance as a mechanism for making key\r\npolitical decisions.\r\nIn order to effectively cope with emerging\r\nchallenges, it is necessary to improve the functioning\r\nof the United Nations institutions by adapting them to\r\ncurrent realities. One way to do this, we believe, is to\r\nincrease the number of permanent members of the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council, while investing it\r\nwith wider or, if necessary, extraordinary powers in\r\norder to combat international extremism.\r\nAs a criterion for increasing membership, we\r\nhave to consider the material, economic, political and\r\nhuman authority of the candidate countries within the\r\ncontext of the new challenges to international security.\r\nMoreover — and this is directed related to today’s\r\nagenda item on culture and peace — the new agenda\r\nwill have to give some thought as to what kind of a\r\ngeneration will be taking over and what they will come\r\nwith. If they adopt the stereotypes of traditional\r\npolitical thinking, this would maintain the threat to the\r\nfuture of humankind. We cannot allow the existing\r\npolitical elite simply to reproduce itself and its own\r\nrecipes for addressing political issues. Along with\r\nthese recipes, terrorism will also be reproduced as a\r\nmethod of political struggle, only in a purer form, since\r\nthe bipolar division of the world that held the current\r\npolitical elite in check no longer exists.\r\nTherefore, it is the new generation that should\r\nbecome the main focus of attention with regard to a\r\nculture of peace. However paradoxical, this is a\r\nrequirement for today, rather than for tomorrow. A new\r\nculture of peace in a new world and new times needs\r\nnew ideas and new people. Therefore, let us try to\r\ncombine our efforts today in order to combat new\r\nthreats, and let us give further thought to how the\r\nUnited Nations, which brings together all cultures and\r\nall civilizations, can resist the new threats.\r\nMr. Moushoutas (Cyprus): Given the state of\r\nworld affairs as we observe the International Decade\r\nfor a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the\r\nChildren of the World, one cannot but think how\r\nnecessary and timely the culture of peace appears\r\ntoday.\r\nWe would like to extend our appreciation to the\r\ndelegation of Bangladesh for inscribing this item on\r\nour agenda and for introducing draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.9, which has our full support.\r\nGovernments of States Parties to the Constitution\r\nof the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization (UNESCO) declare in the\r\npreamble “That since wars begin in the minds of men,\r\nit is in the minds of men that the defences of peace\r\nmust be constructed”. How true that is. We need to\r\ncultivate peace. Education contributes to knowledge\r\nand correct views. The question is one of whether\r\neducation alone builds peace among men and nations.\r\nKnowledge alone may lack the necessary\r\nelements to bring about peace. We must strive through\r\nspiritual uplifting to impute a sense of brotherhood and\r\nlove among people. We are taught to love our\r\nneighbours as ourselves. Blessed be the peacemakers,\r\nis another of the lessons we are taught. The family,\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nschools and places of worship are inseparable sine qua\r\nnon ingredients in making a contribution to the\r\nbuilding of a peaceful world. Of cardinal importance is\r\nthe need to respect diversity, other religions and\r\ncultures. The beauty of integration and of unity in\r\ndiversity must be inculcated and cultivated in our\r\nchildren’s minds if we are to realize the objective and\r\nessence of a culture of peace.\r\nThe item entitled “Dialogue among civilizations”,\r\nwhich was inscribed in the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly by the President of Iran and which has been\r\ndebated in this Hall for the past few years, aims at\r\nadvancing understanding and tolerance and contributes\r\nto peaceful symbiosis in diversity. Diversity must be\r\nmade to be seen for what it is — a part of a beautiful\r\nmosaic, not as a pretext for segregation among peoples\r\nand separatist movements. We have expanded our\r\nhorizons and are continuously making strides in\r\nscientific knowledge. We have reached other parts of\r\nthe cosmos. We have become, or should believe that we\r\nhave become, a global village. At the same time,\r\nhowever, we are paradoxically experiencing partitions,\r\ndivisions and violent separatist extremist movements.\r\nIt is obvious that advances in science have not brought\r\nabout peace. We still live in a state of conflict and\r\nterror. Knowledge has not brought about the much-\r\ndesired result.\r\nWe have identified the causes of conflict in\r\nunderdevelopment, poverty and oppression. We have\r\ntried to reverse the use of force in favour of dialogue\r\nby creating the United Nations, but we have had\r\nlimited success. We still have a long and arduous way\r\nto go. Why? We believe that the answer lies in the fact\r\nthat peace cannot exist without justice, which is the\r\nmost substantive element of peace and one that is\r\ninseparably connected to it. Peace cannot thrive in a\r\nState without the presence of political, economic and\r\nsocial justice.\r\nIrrespective of the grave difficulties that we face\r\nin this lofty endeavour of establishing a culture of\r\npeace, we owe it to our children to strive for a just\r\nworld, a tolerant world, a world of brotherhood and\r\ndiversity where justice prevails and the provisions of\r\nthe United Nations Charter are indeed imbedded in\r\ntheir young minds and hearts.\r\nMr. Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express our appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for his report entitled “International\r\nDecade of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of\r\nthe World” (A/57/186), which contains a full\r\ndescription of the efforts made to implement the\r\nProgramme of Action on a Culture of Peace. I would\r\nalso like to commend the efforts made by Member\r\nStates and the agencies of the United Nations system,\r\nin particular those of UNESCO and the United Nation’s\r\nChildren’s Fund (UNICEF). We wish to emphasize the\r\nimportance of civil society’s active participation in\r\nestablishing the concept of the culture of peace.\r\nThe culture of peace is a very complex process\r\ncharacterized by various phases, objectives and means\r\nat every stage. We must first define what peace is so\r\nthat it may be just and lasting. Thereafter, one of the\r\nmost difficult stages is to agree to peace and to\r\nimplement it, which is a test of our true belief in peace.\r\nAfter that, we will reach the stage we are all working\r\ntowards, namely, the prevalence of a culture of peace\r\nand peaceful co-existence among future generations.\r\nThe Middle East, more than any other region, is\r\nin need of a culture of peace. The continuous cycle of\r\nviolence and counter-violence prevailing in the\r\nPalestinian territories has led to the disappearance of\r\nhopes for peace, a phenomenon that accelerated in the\r\ncourse of the 1990s. We must also not forget that\r\nPalestinians are an occupied people who suffer daily\r\nfrom the practices of the Israeli occupying force. They\r\nare in fact living under siege and are being confronted\r\nwith the threat of land confiscation. In fact, they are\r\nliving under threat to their lives. In addition,\r\nPalestinians are also deprived of appropriate education\r\nand health care, which are the only means of\r\ndeveloping human resources. That means that the\r\nfuture of Palestinian children is being buried alive.\r\nAs we speak of a culture of peace for children, I\r\nwould like to refer to the conclusions recently reached\r\nby the Committee on the Rights of the Child with\r\nregard to the conditions of the rights of Palestinian\r\nchildren living under occupation.\r\nFirst, the Committee has indicated its serious\r\nconcern about the lack of information regarding the\r\ncondition of children in occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories. The Committee is also concerned about\r\ndiscrimination in the legal definition of an Israeli child,\r\nwho is a person under 18 years of age. Under Israeli\r\nmilitary order 132, a Palestinian child is a person under\r\n16 years of age. The Committee has advised the Israeli\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nGovernment to ensure that its law conforms to articles\r\nI and II of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nSecondly, the Committee expressed its serious\r\nconcern at complaints of Palestinian children tortured\r\nby Israeli police at detention centres. The Committee\r\nalso recommended that the Israeli Government should\r\ninvestigate and prosecute every case of torture and\r\nprovide compensation if such torture were proved.\r\nThirdly, the Committee has expressed its serious\r\nconcern about the serious deterioration of health care in\r\nthe Palestinian territories, and has recommended that\r\nevery Palestinian receive health care. Fourthly, the\r\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child has\r\nrecommended that the Israeli Government commit fully\r\nto international humanitarian law and the Fourth\r\nGeneva Convention, refrain from demolishing houses\r\nand provide requisite compensation to victims.\r\nMy country calls on the forces for peace in Israel\r\nto entrench the culture of peace and to break the cycle\r\nof violence and counter-violence stemming from the\r\npractices of the Israeli occupying forces in the\r\noccupied Arab territories.\r\nThe Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity\r\nadopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization stipulates in its preamble\r\nthat culture should be regarded as the set of distinctive\r\nspiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features\r\nof a society or a social group, and that it encompasses,\r\nin addition to art and literature, lifestyles, ways of\r\nliving together, value systems, traditions and beliefs.\r\nThe Declaration emphasizes respect for the diversity of\r\ncultures, tolerance, dialogue, understanding and mutual\r\ntrust as a means of establishing international peace and\r\nsecurity. We would like to point out that religion is one\r\nof the main elements on which cultural diversity is\r\nbased. It should be regarded as a means of promoting\r\ncultural dialogue in a common international endeavour,\r\nand should not be used to foment political\r\nconfrontation or ideological conflict.\r\nWe express our serious concern at the use of\r\nreligion as a basis for discrimination and at the lack of\r\ntolerance and mutual understanding among individuals.\r\nThis destroys human rights and fundamental freedoms\r\nand obstructs the spread of a culture of peace.\r\nMr. Andrabi (Pakistan): The past century was\r\nmarred by conflicting ideologies and by the\r\nglorification of might and its ruthless application.\r\nTwice mankind was plunged into world wars. The\r\nensuing suffering and destruction constituted an affront\r\nto the basic canons of humanity. As time progressed,\r\npeoples and States devised, refined and perfected\r\nmechanisms and instruments to help mankind create\r\nbetter social environments and conditions. The Charter\r\nof the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights were the cardinal instruments that\r\nevolved and introduced the fundamental values of\r\nhumankind: freedom, equality, justice and tolerance.\r\nThe end of the cold war unfolded possibilities for\r\na new world order based on those fundamental values\r\nof mankind. The Declaration and Programme of Action\r\non a Culture of Peace, adopted on 13 September 1999,\r\ninspired adherence to the principles of freedom,\r\ntolerance, cooperation, pluralism, cultural diversity,\r\ndialogue and understanding at all levels of society and\r\namong all nations. The concept of a culture of peace is\r\nenshrined in the Charter. Article 28 of the Universal\r\nDeclaration of Human Rights calls for a world in which\r\nall rights are fully realized. That article pronounces\r\nthat “Everyone is entitled to a social and international\r\norder in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the\r\nDeclaration can be fully realized”. The culture of peace\r\nis firmly embedded in that article.\r\nThe advent of the new millennium gave us fresh\r\nhope. But the traumatic events of 11 September 2001\r\ndealt a serious blow to those hopes, intervening in our\r\njourney to the envisioned goal. While the international\r\ncommunity has shown unity in combating the\r\nabominable phenomenon of terrorism, efforts have,\r\nregrettably, been under way to pit religion against\r\nreligion, culture against culture and civilization against\r\ncivilization. Samuel Huntington’s theory of the clash of\r\ncivilizations is being vigorously pursued by certain\r\ninterested quarters.\r\nNo doubt, the winds that have blown across the\r\nglobe since the terrorist attacks of last year have borne\r\nseeds of both clash and cooperation. It is for us to\r\ndecide which seed to protect and nurture for\r\ngermination.\r\nThe concept of the clash of civilizations was\r\namong several paradigms of the shifting character of\r\nworld politics presented after the end of the cold war.\r\nIts author’s contention that different civilizations and\r\nreligions, embodying different world views, will be at\r\nthe heart of future wars lacks universal acceptability\r\nand is antithetical to the concept of the culture of\r\npeace. The culture of peace is a more rational and saner\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nalternative for mankind. It accepts plurality and\r\ndiversity among cultures and asserts that a harmonious\r\nform can emerge through the assimilation and\r\ncoexistence of different cultures.\r\nReligion and culture are two interrelated strands\r\nof any society. The significance of religion stems from\r\nthe need of a human being to satisfy spiritual needs\r\nthrough specific religious pursuits. Religions hold great\r\npotential. They can play an important role in\r\nreconciling differences, promoting a universal ethical\r\ncode and working together to create a climate in which\r\nmorality and justice prevail. Religion has been a\r\npowerful force throughout human history. All religions\r\nespouse the dignity of the individual and social justice.\r\nThrough their teachings, religions affirm the values of\r\ntolerance, non-discrimination and respect for human\r\nrights. Religious leaders and institutions have often\r\nbeen the impetus for reconciliation and healing within\r\ncommunities where there is tension. Despite that,\r\nhowever, acts of intolerance and discrimination based\r\non religion or belief are common. Many acts of\r\nviolence have been committed in the name of religion.\r\nViolence is an affront to human dignity. Peace, on\r\nthe other hand, is not merely the absence of conflict.\r\nThe culture of peace is a positive and dynamic process,\r\nin which participatory interaction is encouraged and in\r\nwhich conflicts are resolved in a spirit of mutual\r\nunderstanding, harmony and cooperation. Crucial to\r\nthat process is awareness, knowledge and\r\nunderstanding of the existence of others. The Holy\r\nKoran evokes the culture of understanding when it\r\nsays: “O mankind! We created you from a single pair\r\nof a male and a female, and made you into nations and\r\ntribes, that ye may know each other” (The Holy Koran,\r\nXLIX:13).\r\nKnowing each other is related to the quest for\r\nknowledge about different ideologies and cultures.\r\nUnderstanding of one another leads to tolerance,\r\nacceptance, respect, harmony and participation, which\r\nculminates in a culture of peace.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the delegation of\r\nBangladesh and other delegations for their positive\r\ncontribution in realizing culture of peace. We support\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.9/Rev.1, on a culture of peace,\r\nintroduced by Bangladesh.\r\nThe Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace\r\nencourages Member States to take action to promote a\r\nculture of peace at the national level, as well as at the\r\nregional and international levels. It also calls upon the\r\nUnited Nations system to strengthen its ongoing efforts\r\nin promoting a culture of peace.\r\nAccordingly, it is the intention of the delegation\r\nof Pakistan to introduce, during the next few days,\r\nunder agenda item 24, entitled “Culture of peace”, a\r\ndraft resolution containing a draft declaration on\r\nreligious and cultural understanding, harmony and\r\ncooperation. We are certain that the proposed\r\ndeclaration would contribute to promoting and\r\nstrengthening a culture of peace in the new millennium.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): “Since\r\nwars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of\r\nmen that the defences of peace must be constructed.”\r\nThis statement, contained in the preamble of the\r\nConstitution of the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is the\r\nfoundation for the Declaration and Programme of\r\nAction on a Culture of Peace, adopted by the General\r\nAssembly three years ago.\r\nThose two cardinal documents will continue to\r\ninspire the action of our respective States and\r\nGovernments, intergovernmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and other actors of civil\r\nsociety, all of which are equally eager to contribute to\r\nbuilding the mythical planetary village, that shall\r\nreconcile wealthy residential areas and hopeless\r\noutlands. Failure to do so will hinder the global\r\ncommunity’s legitimate aspirations to quietude, well-\r\nbeing and a better future.\r\nSince peace is not merely the absence of war,\r\ninternational action to promote a culture of peace and\r\ntolerance cannot be limited to countries in conflict, in\r\nsituations of potential conflict or in post-conflict\r\nsituations. As stipulated in article 2 of the Declaration,\r\n“Progress in the fuller development of a culture\r\nof peace comes about through values, attitudes,\r\nmodes of behaviour and ways of life conducive to\r\nthe promotion of peace among individuals,\r\ngroups and nations.” (res. 53/243 A)\r\nThus, such progress must lead in particular to the\r\npromotion of the peaceful settlement of disputes and a\r\nculture of crisis prevention; the consolidation of\r\ndemocracy, universal respect for and observance of all\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the\r\nprinciples of good governance; the full exercise of\r\npeoples of their right to self-determination, especially\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nthose under foreign occupation; and respect for the\r\nprinciples of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and\r\npolitical independence of States.\r\nThe Programme of Action sets out a panoply of\r\nmeasures to strengthen a culture of peace through\r\neducation, to establish lasting economic and social\r\ndevelopment, to promote respect for all human rights\r\nand gender equality, to favour democratic participation\r\nand to guarantee the free flow of information and\r\nknowledge.\r\nThe report of the Director-General of UNESCO\r\nbefore us for consideration provides a good accounting\r\nof the progress made in the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action and of the goals\r\nof the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and\r\nNon-Violence for the Children of the World, 2001-\r\n2010.\r\nSenegal welcomes the many and important\r\ninitiatives taken by UNESCO and the personal\r\ncommitment of its Director-General to implementing\r\nthe agreed strategic goals. In this context, my\r\ndelegation full adheres to the proposal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to proclaim 21 September as a day of global\r\nceasefire and non-violence. Senegal also endorses the\r\npriority themes of the International Decade for the\r\nyears 2003, 2004 and 2005, which address respectively\r\nparticipatory communication, the free flow of\r\ninformation and knowledge and respect for human\r\nrights and gender equality.\r\nThe protection of children must be highlighted,\r\nand my delegation welcomes the initiatives of the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on\r\neducation for peace and encourages UNICEF and\r\nUNESCO to pursue and step up their cooperation in the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action and the\r\nobjectives of the Decade.\r\nSenegal is more than ever determined to attach\r\nhigh priority to the dialogue among cultures and\r\ncivilizations as a vector, vehicle and strategy for\r\nconsolidating and expanding the bases of a culture of\r\npeace and of peace among the different cultures of the\r\nworld. To that end, we must support the flourishing and\r\ncomplementarity of the very rich cultures of our planet\r\nand promote respect for diversity.\r\nConsequently, we remain convinced that\r\nglobalization must not be equated with cultural\r\nhomogenization and a uniform pattern of thinking.\r\nGlobalization, far from being limited exclusively to\r\neconomics and trade exchanges, must fertilize dialogue\r\nand cultural exchanges among individuals, peoples,\r\nnations and States, with respect for the cultural,\r\nreligious and civilizational identities of peoples — all\r\npeoples.\r\nIn this connection, we must ensure strict respect\r\nfor international legal human rights instruments, in\r\nparticular the rights of ethnic, cultural and religious\r\nminorities, and intensify the struggle against racism,\r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related\r\nintolerance, in conformity with the Durban Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action. Senegal therefore\r\nencourages the United Nations system, and UNESCO\r\nin particular, to develop their information and\r\nnetworking assets by providing up-to-date information\r\non the best means of promoting the global movement\r\nfor a culture of peace.\r\nIn this respect, my Government believes that the\r\nimplementation of the UNESCO Universal Declaration\r\non Cultural Diversity can contribute broadly to creating\r\na global culture of understanding, tolerance, solidarity\r\nand non-violence. In this connection, we believe it to\r\nbe of the highest importance better to involve the\r\nmedia, schools, universities, non-formal educators and\r\nthe non-governmental organizations in disseminating\r\nthat important Declaration and in promoting the social,\r\nethnic and ethical values of peace and non-violence\r\namong children and youth.\r\nIt is indeed time to disarm history, as the\r\nDirector-General of UNESCO is fond of recalling, and\r\nto move beyond the dialectical relationship between the\r\ntyranny of the dogmatic universalism of uniform\r\nthinking and the dictatorship of the unmitigated\r\nspecificity of identity politics. It is high time to pacify\r\nhistory so as to teach our children the history not only\r\nof power and warfare, but also and above all of the\r\nmarvellous conquests of knowledge and culture.\r\nIt will thus be clear why I wish to stress the\r\nextreme importance that my country, Senegal, attaches\r\nto cultural exception, a principle and ethic that must be\r\nrespected as a sacred duty today more than ever before,\r\nwhen there is a growing and dangerous trend towards\r\nthe merchandizing of culture and the objectification of\r\ncultural products. There is a great danger that, unless\r\nwe are careful, we may see the transformation of\r\nmyriad cultures into mere market products or, worse,\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nthe very negation of the essential elements of\r\nhumankind’s cultural patrimony.\r\nThe recent summit of the International\r\nOrganization of la Francophonie (OIF), meeting in\r\nBeirut on the theme of “dialogue among cultures”,\r\ndrew attention to that trend, which is as pernicious as it\r\nis real and consequential. Here at the United Nations,\r\nwe bear the collective responsibility of meeting the\r\nchallenge and of ensuring that multilateral trade\r\nnegotiations in the World Trade Organization take this\r\nfundamental fact duly into account.\r\nIn this regard, the OIF — which recently chose\r\nMr. Abdou Diouf, former head of State of Senegal, as\r\nits leader — proposed the drafting and adoption of an\r\ninternational convention on cultural diversity, which\r\nendorses, inter alia, respect for the principle of\r\nmultilingualism. Such a proposal should be\r\ndisseminated and widely supported in the interest of\r\npreserving and defending the cultures of the world —\r\nall the cultures of the world — their synergy and\r\nnecessary complementarities: in a word, their\r\nsymbiosis. In an indictment rightfully stigmatizing the\r\nsteam-rolling globalization of cultures, French\r\nPresident Jacques Chirac wondered “whether the West\r\ndid not feel it was imposing a dominant culture,\r\nessentially materialistic, which is perceived as\r\naggressive since most of mankind encounters and\r\nobserves it without having access to it.”\r\nAfter all is said and done, and under the influence\r\nof recent terrorist events which the world is still\r\ncopying with, we must do everything to prevent, avert\r\nand contain the clash of civilizations that is promoted\r\nby the prophets of doom and their allies, by fanaticism\r\nof all stripes, by implacable enemies of freedom who in\r\ntheir hideous apocalyptic madness wish to bring about\r\na confrontation of cultures, traditions and religions to\r\npit people against people, culture against culture, and\r\nreligion against religion. This clash of cultures, beliefs\r\nand civilizations can only provoke hatred and chaos,\r\nthen the crumbling of mankind’s cultural heritage, the\r\ndecline of a culture of peace, mutual understanding and\r\ntolerance, and the disintegration of that humanism\r\nwhich, according to UNESCO, is meant to be an\r\nethnical development centred on sharing by all.\r\nFirst, mankind must be freed and restored to its\r\nprimordial humanity, made aware of the values of\r\ncivilization, without ignoring the creative diversity of\r\nprior realities and present constraints. We must practice\r\ndialogue, exchanges and sharing in all areas, but\r\nbasically in the area of culture which is the vital source\r\nand the ultimate goal of all human activity.\r\nMankind, situated at the beginning and the end of\r\ndevelopment, must be everywhere in the progression of\r\ncultures towards a “Civilization of the Universe”, as\r\nnoted in the poems of Lépold Sédar Senghor, or in the\r\nadvent of the “Millennium of Lights” declaimed by\r\nAbdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of Senegal.\r\nIn a constantly changing globalized world, which\r\nloses all its points of reference, Good loses its nobility\r\nand Evil loses its horror, spreading insecurity, fear,\r\nhostility and confrontation. On this globalized Earth —\r\nalways one but always divided — between\r\ndisintegration and reconstruction of a fragmented\r\nplanet, the universal fight for the sacredness of the\r\nsupreme values of liberty, justice and peace is\r\nindissolubly joined with the crusade/jihad of humanity\r\nfor a world constantly better.\r\nWith all that is beautiful and true in this world,\r\nwith sublime hopes and idealized illusions, let us\r\ndream — but in practical terms and all together — of a\r\npeaceful world in which the impulse towards the other\r\nto know him better and to know one’s self better\r\nthrough him, will allow us to weave an enduring fabric\r\nof pan-human solidarity, the sine qua non for the\r\nredemption of the veritable humanist culture which\r\nunderlies the much-desired emergence of a new\r\nplanetary citizenship. A fruitful dialogue of cultures\r\ncan accomplish this.\r\nThe President: In accordance with resolution\r\n48/265 of 24 August 1994, I now call on the Observer\r\nof the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.\r\nMr. Linati-Bosch (Sovereign Military Order of\r\nMalta): Thank you very much, Mr. President, for\r\ngiving me the floor on behalf of the Sovereign Military\r\nOrder of Malta. This is the first time that I am\r\naddressing the General Assembly at its current session.\r\nAllow me to add my voice to the congratulations which\r\nhave preceded me. I have already witnessed the\r\nexpertise with which you have conducted the debates. I\r\nam confident that under your presidency, the present\r\nsession of this body will set new standards for the\r\nquality of its debates.\r\nCulture is a very broad concept. It comprises\r\ndeveloping intellectual and moral faculties, especially\r\nthrough education. It supposes an integrated pattern of\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nhuman behaviour and, at the same time, customary\r\nbeliefs, social forms and material trades of a racial,\r\nreligious or social group.\r\nThe first reason for the existence of the United\r\nNations is to maintain peace and security. The Order of\r\nMalta commends the efforts of the United Nations to\r\naccomplish this aim, but we are aware that we are\r\nliving in a convulsed and difficult world. There is no\r\npeace when armed conflicts exist. There is no peace\r\nwhen violence, ignorance, poverty, genocide and\r\ndiscrimination continue to affect our daily lives.\r\nSince wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the\r\nminds of men that the defences of peace must be\r\nconstructed. That idea from the Preamble of the\r\nUNESCO Constitution forms the basis for the concept\r\nof a culture of peace. The essence of constructing a\r\nculture of peace is the prevention of violence and\r\nconflict, both outwardly and in our hearts and minds.\r\nWe believe that an international society founded on a\r\nculture of peace must be based on tolerance, justice and\r\nhuman rights.\r\nIn 1999, the General Assembly proclaimed the\r\nDeclaration on a Culture of Peace (resolution 53/243),\r\nwhich stated that Governments, international\r\norganizations and civil society may be guided in their\r\nactivity by provisions of the Declaration to promote\r\nand strengthen a culture of peace in the new\r\nmillennium. Article 1 of the Declaration states that a\r\nculture of peace is a set of values, attitudes, traditions\r\nand modes of behaviour and ways of life based on\r\nrespect for life, ending violence and promotion and\r\npractice of non-violence through education, dialogue\r\nand cooperation. These are the essential principles that\r\nmust receive special attention in education and\r\nawareness-raising on every level.\r\nA culture of peace cannot be considered as a\r\nseparate notion. On the contrary, it is part of a\r\nframework that includes economic and social problems\r\nstrongly tied to human development. A culture of peace\r\nmust not be a milestone but a cornerstone of progress\r\nand benefit to mankind. Through a culture of peace the\r\nworld must become even more aware of the importance\r\nof values, attitudes and traditions that respect human\r\nbeings and their rights. Freedom, justice, tolerance and\r\nsolidarity are values that frame the goal of the total\r\nrejection of violence.\r\nThe Declaration and Programme of Action on a\r\nCulture of Peace involve the international community\r\nin a firm determination to eliminate violence through\r\ndialogue. Among the actions to promote international\r\npeace and security the Programme of Action includes\r\npromoting initiatives in conflict situations such as days\r\nof tranquillity to carry out immunization and medicine\r\ndistribution campaigns, corridors of peace to ensure\r\ndelivery of humanitarian supplies and sanctuaries of\r\npeace to respect the central role of health and medical\r\ninstitutions such as hospitals and clinics. The Order of\r\nMalta regards this as a very important clause. Our\r\nhospitals and clinics have borne the brunt of war.\r\nWe firmly believe that there exists a collective\r\nresponsibility to uphold human dignity and equality\r\nand, indeed, to ensure as far as possible that\r\nglobalization becomes a positive force for the world’s\r\npeople. Without such joint and broad endeavours, the\r\nlikelihood of peace is faint and distant.\r\nDevelopment is important to stability but faces\r\nformidable obstacles. They include external debt\r\nproblems, barriers to market access, lack of\r\ninfrastructure, clean water shortages and diseases. Yes,\r\nit is true that war, disease, hunger and death are the\r\nfour horsemen of the Apocalypse. Today they continue\r\nto threaten human progress. Practical measures must be\r\nadopted, setting goals that can be brought to\r\nrealization. Words must be translated into action.\r\nTo conclude, allow me to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and all Members of the General Assembly for\r\ntheir constructive approach to a culture of peace. The\r\nOrder of Malta is conscious of its responsibility and\r\nwishes to collaborate with the international community\r\nto achieve a truly effective culture of peace.\r\nThe President: I have been informed that Israel\r\nhas asked for the right of reply. I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Israel.\r\nMr. Schacham (Israel): I would like to reply to\r\nthe statement made today by the representative of\r\nEgypt. I agree fully with my Egyptian colleague’s\r\nintroduction to his statement regarding the importance\r\nof achieving signed peace agreements, which remain\r\nthe best foundation for the development of a culture of\r\npeace between two nations that were hitherto in\r\nconflict.\r\nThat is, indeed, what our two States, Israel and\r\nEgypt, have done. Egypt was and is a pioneer among\r\nthe Arab States in this regard. And its late President,\r\nAnwar Sadat, who signed a peace treaty with Israel,\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nwas a true man of courage. Since the signing of that\r\ntreaty, Israel and Egypt have tried to build upon it.\r\nAlthough our relationship can still be cold at times, the\r\neffort made by Egypt to promote peace between Israel\r\nand the rest of our Arab neighbours has been\r\nunrelenting.\r\nI am therefore puzzled by the rest of the Egyptian\r\nrepresentative’s statement this morning. The\r\nrepresentative of Egypt has, unfortunately, used this\r\nvital discussion of a most serious issue to launch an\r\nextraneous attack against my country.\r\nThe unprecedented and one-sided diatribe by the\r\nEgyptian representative refers solely to the situation of\r\none specific group of children and runs contrary to the\r\nuniversal spirit of the two draft resolutions before us.\r\nIn that connection, Israel welcomed the assessment\r\nissued by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in\r\nits Recommendations of its thirty-first session that\r\namidst continuing acts of terror, especially the\r\ndeliberate and indiscriminate targeting and killing of\r\nIsraeli civilians, including children, by Palestinian\r\nsuicide bombers, the Committee recognized the climate\r\nof fear that persisted and the State party’s right to live\r\nin peace and security.\r\nIsrael also welcomed the Committee’s\r\nrecommendation that other non-State actors fully\r\nrespect the rights of children and refrain from using or\r\ntargeting children in the armed conflict. Israel also\r\nwelcomes the Committee’s strong urging that\r\nimmediate and all necessary measures be taken to end\r\nthe violence and to ensure that children were not\r\nrecruited nor participate in the conflict.\r\nUnfortunately, the representative of Egypt\r\ncompletely ignored the cynical abuse of children in the\r\nPalestinian campaign of violence and terrorism, the\r\ndirect participation of Palestinian children in acts of\r\nterrorism, including suicide bombings, and the\r\nunbridled incitement to violence by the Palestinian\r\neducational system and in the official Palestinian\r\nmedia. All those practices have been condemned by the\r\nmajority of Member States.\r\nThe Egyptian statement is also devoid of any\r\nreference to the destructive effects that the Palestinian\r\nresort to terrorism has had on the Israeli side, which\r\nhas lost more than 650 civilians, including more than\r\n100 children. Approximately 900 Israeli children have\r\nbeen injured in terrorist attacks. A number of\r\nPalestinian terrorist attacks have been deliberately\r\ndirected at children, including attacks on school buses,\r\ndiscotheques, pizza parlours and other locations where\r\nlarge numbers of children are known to gather.\r\nUnfortunately, the Egyptian statement fails to\r\nreflect the fact that the central threat to the well-being\r\nof Palestinian children is the terrorists themselves.\r\nIn the interest of brevity, I will not exercise again\r\nmy right of reply on this agenda item.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMs. Khalil (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): As the\r\nrepresentative of Israel has just said, Egypt was the\r\nfirst in the Middle East to extend the hand of peace to\r\nIsrael out of its conviction that peace is the only way to\r\nsettle the dispute in the Middle East. Violence and\r\ncounter-violence are a direct result of the oppressive\r\nIsraeli measures and the Israeli occupation of the\r\nPalestinian territory. The only way to break the cycle of\r\nviolence is the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories in conformity with the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nEgypt strongly condemns all acts of violence\r\nagainst civilians, whether Israelis or Palestinians. The\r\nGovernment of Israel is ignoring the fact that violence\r\nand counter-violence are a direct result of the Israeli\r\noccupation of the Palestinian territories. The only\r\nsolution is Israel’s complete withdrawal from the\r\nPalestinian territories.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/57/L.9/Rev.1, entitled\r\n“International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-\r\nViolence for the Children of the World, 2001-2010.”\r\nBefore preceding to take action on the draft\r\nresolution, I should like to announce that, since the\r\nintroduction of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become co-sponsors of A/57/L.9/Rev.1:\r\nBelarus, Burundi, Dominica, Egypt, Grenada,\r\nHonduras and Kuwait.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.9/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/57/L.9/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 57/6).\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nThe President: We have thus concluded this\r\nstage of our consideration of agenda item 24.\r\nMr. Hidayat (Indonesia), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nAgenda item 41 (continued)\r\nFinal review and appraisal of the implementation of\r\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\r\nof Africa in the 1990s\r\n(a) Final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/57/468/Add.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/468/Add.1, para. 3)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has\r\nbefore it a note by the Secretary-General transmitting\r\nPart II of the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the\r\nWhole of the General Assembly for the Final Review\r\nand Appraisal of the Implementation of the United\r\nNations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in\r\nthe 1990s, circulated in document A/57/468/Add.1.\r\nIn that connection, the General Assembly has\r\nbefore it a draft resolution recommended by the Ad\r\nHoc Committee in paragraph 3 of the Note.\r\nI give the floor to His Excellency Mr. Dumisani\r\nShadrack Kumalo of South Africa, in his capacity as\r\nVice-Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole\r\nof the General Assembly for the Final Review and\r\nAppraisal of the Implementation of the United Nations\r\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the\r\n1990s, who will introduce the draft resolution\r\ncontained in paragraph 3 of document A/57/468/Add.1.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): On behalf of the\r\nAfrican Union, I am honoured to introduce a draft\r\nresolution that will establish the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) as a framework for\r\nfuture engagement for the international community,\r\nincluding the United Nations, with the African\r\ncontinent. I do so because this draft resolution has its\r\nfoundation in the African Renaissance, something\r\nowned and promoted by Africans themselves. It is an\r\nexpression of commitment in this draft resolution by all\r\nof Africa’s partners to ensure a prosperous future for\r\nthe continent.\r\nThe adoption of this draft resolution will\r\nultimately mean that Africa has again given notice\r\nbefore the international community of its commitment\r\nto take responsibility for its own future. At the same\r\ntime, developed partners, including the United Nations\r\nsystem, have indicated their commitment to enter into a\r\npartnership that will benefit the continent.\r\nThis is the culmination of a process that started in\r\nthe Economic and Social Council last year when the\r\nNew African Initiative was first endorsed in the\r\nMinisterial Declaration of the substantive session of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council. Through the\r\nplacement of NEPAD at the centre of the international\r\ncommunity’s commitment to Africa, it has been agreed\r\nthat the priorities identified by Africans themselves\r\nwill receive the attention they deserve through the\r\nguiding of future partnerships with Africa.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the African Union was\r\nformally established in South Africa to replace the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in July 2002, providing\r\nAfrica with a fresh start in facing the new challenges of\r\nan ever- changing international order. In a way, the\r\nadoption of this draft resolution will also symbolize a\r\nnew start for the international community in its\r\ninteraction with Africa. The United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\n(UN-NADAF) and the United Nations Programme of\r\nAction for African Economic Recovery and\r\nDevelopment (UNPAAERD) were programmes that\r\nhad Africa’s best interests at heart, but, owing to a\r\nvariety of reasons, they did not achieve the projected\r\nresults. The adoption of NEPAD as a framework for\r\ninteraction with Africa shows that lessons were learned\r\nfrom past failures, that constructive ideals were kept\r\nand expanded, that new priorities were identified and\r\nthat the principles of ownership, accountability and\r\npartnership were reaffirmed and accepted. At the same\r\ntime, the importance of South-South cooperation was\r\nhighlighted in a spirit of compassion and commitment.\r\nHowever, caution should be expressed so that we\r\nremind ourselves that this draft resolution’s success is\r\nbased on the principle that the root causes of under-\r\ndevelopment should be addressed in a comprehensive\r\nmanner. The implementation of the decisions taken at\r\nBrussels, Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg is thus of\r\ngreat importance. Africa, therefore, supports the\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nproposal to establish a structure in the Secretariat to\r\nreview and report on the support of the United Nations\r\nsystem and of the international community for NEPAD\r\nand on the coordinated implementation of summit and\r\nconference outcomes as they relate to Africa.\r\nThe decision to place on the annual agenda of the\r\nGeneral Assembly a single, wide-ranging agenda item,\r\nfocusing on progress made with regard to\r\nimplementation and to international support for\r\nAfrica’s development, is also welcomed. In that regard,\r\nwe are proud to be able to make a positive and\r\npractical contribution to the efforts to revitalize the\r\nwork of the General Assembly by participating in a\r\nfocused debate on Africa’s development.\r\nIt is again our plea that all stakeholders in\r\nNEPAD — including the private sector and civil\r\nsociety — continue to expand their contribution to\r\nensure that we succeed in improving the quality of life\r\nof everyone in Africa. The commitment made by the\r\nGroup of Eight (G-8) industrialized countries through\r\nthe adoption of the G-8 Africa Action Plan is\r\nwelcomed, and it is hoped that the appeal to encourage\r\nthe G-8’s private sectors to invest in Africa will result\r\nin enhanced trading, in the transfer of appropriate\r\ntechnology, in the sharing of expertise and in capacity-\r\nbuilding, which would ultimately benefit all\r\nstakeholders. The importance of market access for\r\nAfrican products cannot be overemphasized.\r\nAfrica appreciates the fact that there was a\r\npositive response to this draft resolution, as it\r\npresented the first opportunity for the General\r\nAssembly to address African issues since Africa’s\r\nspecial needs were recognized at the Millennium\r\nSummit some two years ago. While this first effort\r\nseems somewhat hesitant, we appreciate the\r\nrecognition of the particular needs of our continent in\r\nthe areas of debt, official development assistance,\r\ntrade, investment and technology transfer, and we are\r\nconfident that we will be able to build on those in\r\nfuture.\r\nAs Chair of the African Union, we have no fear\r\nof contradiction in recommitting the continent to the\r\ngoals of this draft resolution and to future deliberations\r\non the issues contained therein. We particularly look\r\nforward to discussing issues in the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and in the General Assembly, as\r\nenvisaged in the draft resolution. We will also give our\r\nfull support to the Adviser for Special Assignments in\r\nAfrica, and we trust that we can make a positive\r\ncontribution to the effective functioning of that Office.\r\nAfrica will also continue, within its means, to\r\nbuild and strengthen human and institutional capacities\r\nat the subregional and regional levels to ensure the\r\nsuccessful implementation of NEPAD. As recently as\r\n29 October 2002, our Minister of Finance announced in\r\nParliament that the allowance governing South African\r\ncorporations’ use of South African funds to finance\r\nnew direct investment in Africa has been increased\r\nfrom $75 million to $200 million. That is only one\r\nexample of efforts by many African countries to\r\nfacilitate and increase the participation of their private\r\nsectors in Africa’s own development.\r\nFinally, Africa is of the opinion that this draft\r\nresolution provides a strong base from which African\r\nissues can be projected within the General Assembly\r\nand its Committees, the Economic and Social Council,\r\nUnited Nations funds, programmes and specialized\r\nagencies and the rest of the international community.\r\nWe are therefore committed to the success of the draft\r\nresolution and will continue to play a constructive role\r\nin advancing the ideals of NEPAD, as we owe it to\r\nourselves and those who will come after us.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation congratulates all\r\nthose delegations that actively and conscientiously\r\nparticipated in ensuring the success of this draft\r\nresolution on the United Nations New Agenda for the\r\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s and support for the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development. I urge all\r\ndelegations to support the draft resolution that is before\r\nus on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nThe Acting President: The assembly will now\r\nproceed to take a decision on the draft resolution\r\nentitled “Final review and appraisal of the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\r\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s and support for\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development”,\r\nrecommended in paragraph 3 of document\r\nA/57/468/Add.1.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\nthe draft resolution?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n57/7).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 41?\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 29\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in\r\nDeveloping Countries, particularly in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/123)\r\nMr. Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Malaria,\r\nAIDS and tuberculosis have become major public\r\nhealth challenges; they impede development efforts in\r\nmany countries. The United Nations, by its resolution\r\n55/284 declared this the Decade to Roll Back Malaria\r\nin Developing Countries, particularly in Africa. To be\r\nsure, we support the mobilization of every possible\r\neffort to combat AIDS, but we need similar efforts to\r\nfight malaria, which a World Health Organization\r\n(WHO) report indicates is spreading widely and\r\ncausing severe social and economic damage analogous\r\nto that caused by AIDS.\r\nReports also show that malaria is spreading in\r\nmore than 100 countries, with 40 per cent of the\r\nworld’s population, over a wide area that extends\r\nthrough Africa, Central and South America, South-East\r\nAsia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, some\r\nEuropean countries and the western Pacific. Among the\r\n300 to 500 million cases, 90 per cent are in Central,\r\nEast and West Africa. Of the more than 1 million who\r\ndie annually of malaria, most are children, due to their\r\nweak immune systems. It is indeed sad and painful that\r\none child dies of malaria every 30 seconds.\r\nThat is painful not just because of the high\r\nincidence of malaria among the elderly and children\r\nbut also because malaria is a disease that can easily be\r\ntreated if diagnosed early. Providing medicine for\r\ntreatment to those who cannot afford to buy it,\r\nespecially in African countries, should be more\r\nimportant than commercial interests. In many African\r\ncountries malaria is an economic and social problem,\r\nnot just a health problem. It affects the productivity of\r\nindividuals and their ability to earn enough to support\r\ntheir families. Studies have shown that some African\r\ncountries lose 22 per cent of their working hours\r\nbecause of malaria. In some cases, malaria has stricken\r\n25 per cent of the population.\r\nMalaria also prevents children from going to\r\nschool and thus limits their ability to build their future.\r\nIt is thus undermining the future as well as the present.\r\nStatistics prove that malaria is both a result and a cause\r\nof poverty. There is a huge gap between the resources\r\nneeded to deal with the causes of the disease in\r\ndeveloping countries and the material wealth and\r\nhuman resources those countries possess.\r\nWHO estimates that $1 billion should be spent, in\r\naddition to what is being spent now, to attain the\r\nobjectives of the Decade. It is not expected that the gap\r\ncan be bridged without a sustained increase in official\r\ndevelopment assistance in the field of health, and\r\nwithout easing the burden of servicing. That would\r\nenable countries to free more resources to deal with the\r\ndiseases that threaten their communities, especially\r\nmalaria.\r\nI would like to refer here to the important\r\nrecommendations included in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on this item (A/57/123). The\r\ndelegation of Egypt supports the Secretary-General’s\r\ncall for increased support for the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and for increased\r\nbilateral assistance in combating malaria.\r\nIf one child dies of malaria every 30 seconds, I\r\ncall on all Governments, especially the donor\r\ncommunity, to do some simple arithmetic and calculate\r\nhow many died while I was delivering my statement,\r\nhow many will die as we deliberate on this item and\r\nhow many will have to die before the international\r\ncommunity moves to eradicate this easily treated\r\ndisease by providing the necessary medicine. All we\r\nneed is a small fraction of what the world spends every\r\nday on armaments and on building up arsenals that will\r\neventually be used — when and against whom no one\r\nknows.\r\nMr. Menan (Togo)(spoke in French): During its\r\nfifty-fifth session, the General Assembly proclaimed\r\nthe period 2001-2010, as the Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria in Developing Countries, particularly in\r\nAfrica. In many respects, this was a very important\r\ndecision taken by the international community with a\r\nview to seriously addressing one of the crucial health\r\nproblems that developing countries, unfortunately,\r\ncontinue to face.\r\nIn order to achieve this goal, the General\r\nAssembly, in resolution 55/284, inter alia, called upon\r\nthe international community to help those countries\r\nwhere malaria is endemic to improve their national\r\nhealth systems, in order to attain by 2005 a certain\r\nnumber of specific targets, including prompt access to\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\ntreatment; a more widespread use of insecticide-treated\r\nmosquito nets (ITNs); the prevention of malaria; and\r\nan effective combat against that illness, particularly for\r\nthose most at risk, including pregnant women and\r\nchildren. The fight against the pandemic of malaria is\r\nof great urgency in order to reduce people’s\r\nvulnerability to that sickness.\r\nIn his report to the General Assembly on the\r\nimplementation of the goals of the Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria, the Secretary-General, after assessing the\r\nsituation and taking note of the specific actions that\r\nhave been taken, emphasizes in particular certain\r\npriority areas that must be focused on in order to\r\nstrategically pursue the desired objectives.\r\nWhile reiterating its appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the high quality of his report, the\r\ndelegation of Togo would like to particularly\r\nemphasize the following areas, which we deem of great\r\nimportance with regard to the strategy that needs to be\r\nadopted: awareness-raising among, and the\r\ndissemination of information to, the peoples of regions\r\nwhere malaria is endemic; the promotion of partnership\r\nat all levels, particularly between the countries of the\r\nNorth and the South; improved procedures and\r\nmethods for combating malaria; and the mobilization\r\nof the necessary financial resources.\r\nRegarding the question of outreach, the\r\nSecretary-General has recalled the fact that Africa\r\nMalaria Day, which was launched by the Abuja\r\nDeclaration on the Roll Back Malaria Initiative, is\r\ncommemorated on 25 April, with a view to supporting\r\nthe efforts under way and monitoring the progress\r\nachieved in efforts to combat malaria in Africa. This\r\nyear’s commemoration provided an opportunity for\r\ncertain countries in the continent to carry out broad-\r\nbased activities aimed at, inter alia, combating malaria\r\nat the level of the family and promoting and raising\r\nawareness of, the use of ITNs. In addition, certain non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and private-sector partners\r\nmade use of 25 April to hold their own events to\r\npromote efforts to combat malaria. This initiative\r\nshould be welcomed.\r\nNevertheless, while such one-off activities are\r\nnecessary to create a promising environment for efforts\r\nto combat this disease, we should not lose sight of the\r\nfact that awareness-building should be an ongoing\r\nprocess in order to bring about a mindset that considers\r\nmalaria as an intolerable burden. The tangible progress\r\nthat has been achieved in certain African countries in\r\nthe combat against HIV-AIDS through outreach and\r\nprevention should encourage us to persevere along\r\nthese lines.\r\nAs far as promoting partnership is concerned, I\r\nhardly need to recall the importance of international\r\ncooperation in the context of achieving these goals.\r\nThe launching in 1998 by the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO), the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) and the World Bank of the Roll Back\r\nMalaria Initiative is a vivid illustration of the viability\r\nof such an approach.\r\nIt is important, however, that South-South\r\ncooperation also be further reinforced. It is essential\r\nthat the countries of the South that have been\r\nsuccessful in the combat against or the eradication of\r\nthis disease demonstrate greater solidarity vis-à-vis\r\nthose countries where malaria is still endemic.\r\nLikewise, it is equally important to ensure the\r\nparticipation of the private sector in achieving the\r\ngoals of the Decade. Partnerships between private\r\ncompanies and Governments could make it possible for\r\nGovernments to have access, at affordable prices, to\r\nnew combination anti-malaria therapies that are very\r\neffective against drug resistance and also to ITNs, at a\r\nlower cost. This type of cooperation could also provide\r\nan opportunity for the countries concerned to obtain\r\nnew technologies for manufacturing ITNs and effective\r\npharmacological products.\r\nRegarding the improvement of ways and means\r\nof combating this disease, everything should be done to\r\novercome one of the major difficulties encountered by\r\nAfrica: drug resistance. Products such as chloroquine,\r\nwhich were very effective and cheap, are no longer so\r\nthese days because of the resistance developed by\r\ndisease vectors to these products. It is to be hoped that\r\na new drug called Coartemether, which was recently\r\nendorsed by WHO and which is partly derived from\r\nChinese herbs that are particularly effective in the\r\ntreatment of malaria, will become an alternative\r\nsolution in future.\r\nAs far as mobilizing resources is concerned, the\r\nSecretary-General rightly points out in his report that\r\ninsufficient human and financial resources represent\r\nthe principal obstacle in the combat against malaria.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nIn this connection, the delegation of Togo would\r\nlike to recall that, since the proclamation of the Decade\r\nto Roll Back Malaria, the only initiative taken by the\r\ninternational donor community has been the creation of\r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria. Because of the broad scope of the Fund, it is\r\nto be feared that very few financial resources will be\r\nallocated to anti-malaria efforts. Furthermore,\r\naccording to predictions, only 17 per cent of the\r\ncontributions sent to the Fund would go to the fight\r\nagainst malaria, whereas 61 per cent and 22 per cent,\r\nrespectively, would be allocated to HIV/AIDS and\r\ntuberculosis.\r\nIt is not the intention of my delegation to bemoan\r\nthe condescending attitude of our development\r\npartners, which, I hardly need recall, should assist the\r\nefforts of the developing countries themselves to\r\nresolve their particular problems.\r\nAfter the first year of the Decade to Roll Back\r\nMalaria, it is somewhat premature to assess the effects\r\nof the actions undertaken on morbidity and mortality\r\nrates or to calculate the economic impact on the\r\ncountries affected. Nevertheless, it is important to\r\nemphasize that it is the duty of the international\r\ncommunity to display more active solidarity towards\r\nthe African countries in order to harmoniously achieve\r\nthe Decade’s objectives.\r\nIn this connection, we should not lose sight of the\r\nfact that most of the programmes and plans of action\r\nthat have recently been drawn up by the international\r\ncommunity to help to combat poverty in Africa —\r\nmeasures that gave rise to great hope and optimism\r\namong the African people — unfortunately have not\r\nmade it possible to achieve the expected results, as was\r\nconfirmed by the New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s, which has been terminated by the\r\nGeneral Assembly and replaced by the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nTogo sincerely hopes that the international\r\ncommunity will do everything in its power to ensure\r\nthat the Decade to Roll Back Malaria does not meet\r\nwith a similar fate, and that, above all, it will create\r\nconditions that are conducive to reversing this trend.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): My\r\ncolleague from Togo has just given a very detailed,\r\nwell-documented and edifying statement. I would like\r\nto congratulate him and to associate myself fully with\r\nall of his incisive comments. During the few minutes it\r\ntook to make that statement at least 10 African children\r\ndied from malaria. That fact demonstrates the\r\nimportance of the item that we are considering, and\r\nwhich is of particular concern to us.\r\nBy proclaiming, through resolution 55/284 of 7\r\nSeptember 2001, the period 2001-2010 as the Decade\r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa, the General Assembly fully\r\nacknowledged the true scope of the threat posed by that\r\ndisease to the development of the countries of the\r\nSouth, particularly those in Africa. Malaria is, in fact,\r\nby far the chief cause of mortality in many African\r\ncountries. Together with tuberculosis and AIDS, it is\r\ndangerously compromising the development of our\r\ncountries, as the very alarming statistics show.\r\nSome 300 million people are affected by malaria\r\nevery year. As was pointed out earlier, malaria kills one\r\nAfrican child every 30 seconds, and 90 per cent of\r\ndeaths from malaria occur in Africa. In my country,\r\nSenegal, malaria is the reason for 30 per cent of all\r\nmedical consultations and is responsible for a loss of\r\nearnings equivalent to 1.3 per cent of our gross\r\ndomestic product. Malaria is thus an enormous\r\nchallenge for African countries, which, as the\r\nAssembly is aware, are trying to deal with other urgent\r\nand important challenges at the same time.\r\nA little more than two weeks ago, researchers\r\nfrom West Africa met in Dakar, Senegal, to define a\r\nregional approach to policies to combat malaria and to\r\ntake stock of the effectiveness of anti-malaria\r\npharmaceuticals in the subregion. That gathering\r\nfollowed a meeting of all the French-speaking African\r\ncountries to discuss the disease. This demonstrates\r\nonce again the importance that Senegal attaches to the\r\nfight against malaria and to the implementation of the\r\nobjectives of the Decade, as well as to the Roll Back\r\nMalaria Initiative.\r\nWe believe that the fight against malaria must not\r\nbe trivialized or relegated to a second place after the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. On the contrary, the challenge\r\nof rolling back malaria must be met head on, together\r\nwith that of fighting AIDS.\r\nThe absence or inadequacy of infrastructure and\r\nresources, the resistance of vectors to pharmaceuticals\r\nand insecticides, the inefficacy of prevention strategies,\r\nand poverty — the mother of all these ills — are\r\nserious obstacles that must be overcome if we wish to\r\nachieve the objectives of the Decade, first and foremost\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nto eradicate malaria. To that we can add the meagre\r\nprogress achieved in the quest for a vaccine.\r\nThe Extraordinary Summit of the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity — now the African Union — held at\r\nAbuja, Nigeria, in April 2001, on the fight against\r\nAIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other endemic diseases\r\nin Africa, resulted in the launch of a number of\r\ninitiatives which deserve further support from the\r\ninternational community. By declaring 25 April to be\r\nAfrica Malaria Day, and by committing themselves to\r\ndevoting 15 per cent of their national budgets to health-\r\nrelated expenditure, African countries once again\r\ndemonstrated their collective political will to meet the\r\ncrucial challenges of health and development.\r\nThe Abuja Declaration emphasized the need to\r\n“Reduce or waive taxes and tariffs for mosquito\r\nnets and materials, insecticides, anti-malarial\r\ndrugs and other recommended goods and services\r\nthat are needed for malaria control strategies”.\r\nAs can be seen from the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/57/123), Senegal is among the 10 African\r\ncountries that have taken bold measures to implement\r\nthat recommendation, with a view to facilitating access\r\nto medicine, treatment and preventive care. We\r\ntherefore believe that it is essential to strongly and\r\nsolemnly reiterate here the recommendation to\r\nundertake the necessary fiscal and customs reforms,\r\nwith a view in particular to making more widespread\r\nthe now inadequate use of insecticide-treated mosquito\r\nnets, in particular by children and pregnant women.\r\nThe partnerships established within the\r\nframework of the Roll Back Malaria Initiative have\r\nenabled us to make considerable progress in the\r\ninternational fight against malaria. We must\r\nconsolidate and strengthen it by further involving the\r\nprivate sector, local communities, families, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the media and other\r\nsectors of society in order to attain the goals of the\r\nDecade.\r\nLast but not least, I would like once again to\r\nunderscore the great importance and urgency of\r\nstrengthening worldwide campaigns to mobilize\r\nresources for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria.\r\nTo this end, Senegal totally subscribes to the five\r\nrecommendations included in the Secretary-General’s\r\nreport (document A/57/123), and my country requests\r\nits endorsement by the Assembly.\r\nThank you, Mr. President, for your compassion,\r\nbecause by the time I reach the end of my statement,\r\nmalaria which has affected tens of millions of people,\r\nwill have mortally terminated the possibilities of\r\ndozens of African children who will have succumbed\r\nto an affliction that has also stricken their families,\r\ntheir land, their continent. These are children who will\r\nnot enjoy the presence or affection of their families.\r\nThe loss of these children will, in turn, be a loss to\r\ntheir country and their continent.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 29.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 29.\r\nAgenda item 30\r\nThe role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order\r\n(a) Report of the Secretary-General (A/57/215)\r\n(b) Draft resolution (A/57/L.10)\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Guyana to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.10.\r\nMr. Ishmael (Guyana): It is an honour, on behalf\r\nof the sponsors, to introduce draft resolution A/57/L.10\r\non the role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order.\r\nIn doing so, I wish to avail myself of this\r\nopportunity to highlight some of the considerations that\r\nhave led my Government to pursue this initiative in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. First of all, we were inspired by a\r\nvision of the enormous potential for human\r\ndevelopment created by the end of the cold war, the\r\naccelerated rate of technological development and the\r\ndeepening interdependence of nations. This confluence\r\nof factors led us to believe that it was now opportune\r\nfor the nations of the world to begin to build a new and\r\nenlightened partnership based on mutual respect,\r\ndemocratic governance and popular participation and\r\nembodying the rights and obligations of the parties.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nSecondly, we have been prompted by the\r\nrealization that, over the last two decades, there has\r\nbeen a gradual but definite displacement of\r\ndevelopment from the international policy agenda. This\r\ndisplacement has occurred primarily in the context of\r\ntwo important and interrelated developments —\r\nnamely, the ideological and political ascendancy of\r\neconomic neo-liberalism, with its emphasis on the role\r\nof the market and the accelerated rate of globalization\r\nwhich has itself been increasingly underpinned by a\r\nmarket liberalizing logic. This has engendered new\r\nimbalances in international economic relations and\r\nreinforced the patterns of inequality that have prevailed\r\nover past decades. The time has now come for the\r\ninternational community to create an alternative vision\r\nof development based on a more balanced relationship\r\nbetween the market and the State.\r\nA third factor needs to be taken into account. The\r\nindissoluble link between development and peace\r\nmeans that, if the development agenda were to fail,\r\npeace would certainly be imperilled and vice versa.\r\nWith the proliferation of conflict in various parts of the\r\nworld and the rise of terrorism in recent times, there is\r\na growing preoccupation among developing countries\r\nthat with the astronomical costs of implementing the\r\nagenda for peace and security, the agenda for\r\ndevelopment will be further starved of resources.\r\nDevelopment, in turn, will become a more distant\r\ndream for the billions of the world who need it most.\r\nWe can ill afford to address any one of these challenges\r\nat the expense of the other. New approaches are,\r\ntherefore, needed to ensure that development, peace\r\nand security — public goods essential to human\r\nsurvival — are made mutually reinforcing through a\r\ngreater investment in preventive, rather than\r\nenforcement, action. This will require a sensible\r\nbalance to be struck between these basic purposes of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nA fourth area of concern is the threat to\r\ndemocracy that is inherent in the inattention to\r\ndevelopment. In the socio-economic sphere, for\r\nexample, the ascendancy of economic liberalism has\r\naccentuated inequality at all levels — within countries,\r\nboth developed and developing — as well as among\r\ncountries, North and South, East and West. The\r\npopulation living in absolute poverty in both the South\r\nand North is increasing. Far from the redistribution of\r\nglobal wealth that animated much of the development\r\ndiscourse in times past, we appear to be faced instead\r\nwith a redistribution of global poverty. Whereas the\r\nnumber of the world’s people living on one dollar a day\r\nmay be decreasing, we are being told that the ranks of\r\nthose who subsist on two dollars a day or less are on\r\nthe rise. Individualism and materialism continue to be\r\nextolled at the expense of social and human values.\r\nThe march of globalization, while bringing\r\nunparalleled benefits for some, has at the same time\r\nexacted a heavy human toll. Dramatic economic and\r\nfinancial crises punctuate a more mundane reality of\r\ncreeping marginalization and powerlessness.\r\nAnd, in the political arena, we cannot help but\r\nnote that the ascendancy of democracy often means not\r\ngreater people participation and consensus, but the rule\r\nof the powerful and its manipulation of the majority.\r\nDemocracy is increasingly a cloak for government by\r\noligarchy, often going hand in hand. On the other hand,\r\nthough often practiced at the national level, the virtues\r\nof democracy are still notably absent in the wider\r\ncommunity of nations, creating isolationism among the\r\nrich, rather than solidarity among humankind.\r\nMoreover, the freedoms expected from healthy\r\ncompetition under private enterprise are being rapidly\r\nrestrained by the controlling hand of powerful\r\nconglomerates. Naturally, the proponents of\r\nglobalization and trade liberalization will argue\r\ndifferently. However, it is now increasingly\r\nacknowledged that globalization can no longer remain\r\na rudderless force; it must be managed in the interest of\r\nall.\r\nThe question may still be asked: why such an\r\ninitiative when there may already be others with a\r\nsimilar thrust? And indeed, there has been no dearth of\r\nplans to pursue development. Ever since its creation in\r\n1945, the United Nations has been labouring, decade\r\nupon decade, to devise an international strategy for\r\ndevelopment, and yet decade upon decade, these\r\npainfully negotiated agreements have proved resistant\r\nto implementation. Meanwhile, the goal of\r\ndevelopment continues to elude our grasp.\r\nThe historic adoption of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, two years ago, signalled new hope for\r\nprogress in the development agenda and created a\r\nframework for renewed efforts towards the\r\nachievement of clearly defined goals. Since then,\r\nimportant international conferences have been held on\r\nfinancing for development and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, among other topics. It is, of course, too\r\nsoon to judge what the impact of those conferences on\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\ndevelopment will be. However, we must grapple with\r\nthe reality, two years after the Millennium Summit, that\r\nthe international community as a whole is yet to find a\r\nsolid footing towards achieving the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nAs we ponder the reasons for our shortcomings,\r\nwe invariably lament the chronic lack of the two\r\nelements that are required for progress, namely,\r\npolitical will and financial resources. The crucial\r\nquestions of how we develop the necessary political\r\nwill and how we mobilize the needed resources\r\ntherefore continue to beset us. Unless these core\r\nquestions are resolved we can never hope to have a\r\nbreakthrough in development.\r\nThe current divide between Member States in\r\nboth the philosophy and practice of development can\r\nhardly be expected to encourage a common approach to\r\nthe very difficult challenge of development. Not only is\r\nthere wide disparity in the economic and social\r\nconditions of the developed and developing countries,\r\nthere is also an equally serious difference in their\r\nperspectives on development policy. While we may use\r\nthe same words to refer to these challenges, we may\r\nnot often mean the same things. To many, globalization\r\nis the prescribed panacea for all economic ills, while\r\nothers see it as a threat of further marginalization from\r\nthe global economy. An urgent reconciliation of the\r\nwidely divergent views of partners on world economic\r\nand social issues is a prerequisite for progress in the\r\nfuture. A mere papering over of those differences will\r\nultimately fail the test of implementation.\r\nA second question may be asked: what is the new\r\nglobal human order? What is it all about? This is a fair\r\nquestion that deserves an answer. It is first an honest\r\nand serious attempt to find common ground on which\r\nfuture international cooperation can be solidly based\r\nand to provide a comprehensive and holistic framework\r\nfor development. Furthermore, it is not intended to\r\nconflict with other initiatives and proposals already in\r\nexistence and currently being pursued. Rather, it should\r\nbe considered as a complementary device to facilitate\r\nconsensus on the actions we must take. Conceivably, it\r\ncan also serve as a safety valve, if or when, for\r\nwhatever reason, the established negotiating process\r\nflounders or fails.\r\nThe new global human order is not merely a\r\nphilosophical concept, but a practical agenda for\r\ndevelopment. Among its concrete proposals are a\r\ncomprehensive and definitive solution to the debt\r\nproblem; fashioning a new policy on official\r\ndevelopment assistance; mobilizing new and additional\r\nresources; strengthening and, if necessary, reshaping\r\nglobal institutions; developing a more central role for\r\nthe United Nations in global economic policy making;\r\nand reviewing the role of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions and the World Trade Organization to focus\r\nmore on human development. Indeed, one of the more\r\ninteresting proposals of the new global human order is\r\nthe creation of a modern and enhanced version of the\r\nMarshall Plan to assist developing countries to reach\r\nthe threshold of self-reliant economic development and\r\nto be able to enter the global economy.\r\nLet me now come to a third and final question\r\nthat may be asked. How do we do this? How do we\r\nfind the political will to energize our efforts to create a\r\nnew development paradigm for the twenty-first\r\ncentury? My delegation intends to work with others of\r\nlike mind to explore with development partners the\r\nouter limits to which they would wish to go in\r\ndevelopment cooperation. Such a dialogue could\r\nestablish the basic terms and conditions of a new\r\npartnership and, at the same time, provide a certain\r\ndegree of predictability and reliability in our\r\ncooperation.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the best forum for\r\nundertaking such reconciliation and consensus-building\r\nis the United Nations. As the most representative of\r\ninternational institutions, it is ideally suited to promote\r\nagreement among Member States. Moreover, its\r\nSecretariat is well equipped to provide the necessary\r\nintellectual and technical support to catalyze our\r\nefforts. Member States, however, cannot escape the\r\nresponsibility for determining the uses to which the\r\nOrganization must be put and for deciding how it\r\nshould be geared to perform those functions. Too often,\r\nwe make the mistake of trying to shape institutions\r\nbefore agreeing upon what we wish them to do. The\r\nresult, not surprisingly, is that we often put the cart\r\nbefore the horse.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that the lineaments of\r\nthe new global human order already exist in the United\r\nNations Charter. We need only to build on that\r\nstructure to ensure that the Organization works in the\r\npractical way that the founders intended.\r\nThe draft resolution before us, in underlining the\r\ncommitment of the international community to achieve\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nthe internationally agreed development goals, including\r\nthose contained in the Millennium Declaration, stresses\r\nthe need for a broad-based consensus for action to\r\nsecure development and eradicate poverty. It also calls\r\nfor the further elaboration of the proposal of a new\r\nglobal human order, a call to which we, working with\r\ndelegations and other partners of like mind, are\r\npledged to respond.\r\nFinally, I am pleased to announce that, since the\r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have joined as sponsors: Pakistan, South\r\nAfrica, Thailand and Venezuela. We wish to express\r\nour sincere appreciation to all sponsors for their\r\nvaluable support, as well as to all partners for the spirit\r\nof flexibility and cooperation shown in consultations\r\non the draft resolution.\r\nWith those words, I am pleased to commend draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.10, on the role of the United Nations\r\nin promoting a new global human order, for adoption\r\nby the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: I understand that\r\nconsultations are continuing on this draft resolution. I\r\ntherefore wish to inform Member States that action on\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.10 will be taken at a later date.\r\nAgenda item 32\r\nInformation and communication technologies for\r\ndevelopment\r\nSummary by the President of the fifty-sixth\r\nsession of the General Assembly (A/57/280)\r\nMr. Requeijo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nWe are living in an era of technological revolution, in\r\nwhich information and communications technologies\r\n(ICTs) offer opportunities for countries to have access\r\nin real time to all events occurring in the world and to\r\nhave information on the most recent technological\r\nadvances.\r\nThat reality, however, contrasts against the\r\nasymmetry and imbalance produced by the neo-liberal\r\nglobalization process, in which we are witnessing an\r\nincrease in the levels of poverty, lack of health and\r\nilliteracy. Most of the world population is still living in\r\nconditions of poverty and the technological gap\r\nbetween the developed and the developing countries is\r\nincreasing by leaps and bounds.\r\nData provided by the International\r\nTelecommunications Union show that 62 per cent of all\r\ntelephone lines are in only 23 developed countries,\r\ncovering less than 15 per cent of the world population;\r\n84 per cent of all cellular service subscribers, 91 per\r\ncent of all fax machines and 97 per cent of all Internet\r\nservers are located in developed countries. Those\r\nfigures are alarming. In Africa alone, there are 18 main\r\ntelephone lines per 1,000 inhabitants, whereas\r\ndeveloped countries, which account for 15 per cent of\r\nthe world population, have 567 lines per 1,000\r\ninhabitants.\r\nThe world’s developing countries have limited\r\nfinancial resources, which must be devoted to the fight\r\nagainst poverty, malnutrition, lack of health and\r\nilliteracy, in order to prioritize economic development.\r\nThey also lack the essential human and technical\r\nresources necessary to have access to the opportunities\r\noffered by the technological revolution.\r\nAt the General Assembly’s June 2002 session\r\ndevoted to information and communication\r\ntechnologies for development, emphasis was placed on\r\nthe need for greater international efforts to assist\r\ndeveloping countries in participating in this new\r\ntechnological era. The session recognized that, in order\r\nto resolve the problem of the technology gap, access to\r\ntechnologies was not enough. There are wider gaps,\r\nsuch as the gap between rich and poor and between\r\nurban and rural development, among others.\r\n To be able to develop information and\r\ncommunication technologies, it is necessary first to\r\nresolve basic problems, such as access to electricity\r\nand basic infrastructure for telephony and the Internet.\r\nOfficial development assistance, which is spoken of so\r\noften and implemented so little, cannot be marginalized\r\nin this process of informatics globalization; nor can we\r\nspeak of electronic trade as long as unilateral coercive\r\nsanctions are imposed against developing countries that\r\nnot only cancel out trade opportunities, but also restrict\r\nfree access to new technologies. It is clear that a\r\nradical change is necessary to enable developing\r\ncountries to be participants in and beneficiaries of this\r\nrevolution.\r\nCuba hopes that at the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society, to be held in Geneva in 2003 and\r\nin Tunis in 2005, a critical debate will take place from\r\nwhich concrete initiatives and actions will emerge that\r\nwill enable developing countries to take part in global\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\ntechnological developments and remove their peoples\r\nfrom poverty and marginalization. It is essential that\r\nthe international community provide assistance to\r\ndeveloping countries in order for them to resolve the\r\nobstacles they face, such as lack of infrastructure,\r\neducation, capacity-building, investment and\r\ninterconnectivity.\r\nThere is a need to establish effective cooperation\r\namong all international actors aimed at increasing the\r\neffects of information and communication technologies\r\non development, which will enable the transfer of\r\ntechnology to developing countries on a preferential\r\nbasis, particularly knowledge-based technologies, so\r\nthat our countries will be able to develop our own\r\nhuman resources.\r\nCuba has been the victim for more than four\r\ndecades of an intractable brutal economic trade and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the Government of the\r\nUnited States. Despite major limitations in resources, it\r\nis carrying out a long-term strategy to introduce\r\ninformation technologies in all sectors of society,\r\ngiving priority to the social aspects of computerization,\r\nso that, with our available limited resources, access to\r\nthese technologies will be as broad as possible.\r\nThe first priority is human resources training,\r\nparticularly of youth. The establishment of Youth\r\nComputer Clubs in all urban and rural areas of the\r\ncountry provides necessary equipment and instructors\r\nfor free education on informatics to children and\r\nadolescents, as well as to the rest of the population who\r\nare interested in the subject.\r\nIn 2002, 12,074 teachers have been trained to\r\nteach computer use in all primary schools of the\r\ncountry. Computers have been installed in all primary\r\nand secondary schools, which allows us to develop\r\nchildren’s capacities from an early age and prepare\r\nthem to handle informatics and communications\r\ntechniques.\r\nIn recent months, computer technology schools\r\nhave also been established in Cuba to train millions of\r\nyoung people in the basic elements of computers and\r\nelectronics as the necessary basis for dealing with\r\nincreased informatics applications in all sectors of\r\nsociety, as required by the new era of informatics and\r\ncommunications.\r\nWe are still at the dawn of this new era but,\r\nunless we correct its present defects from the start, we\r\nwill continue to speak about digital divides and\r\ntechnological alienation. If we really want humankind\r\nto make progress and for all of us to enjoy\r\ntechnological advances, it is necessary to immediately\r\nadopt, urgent and effective actions, before it is too late.\r\nThat is our challenge.\r\nMr. Cheah Sam Kip (Malaysia): ICTs have\r\nrevolutionalized the world. They have immense\r\npotential and, if properly harnessed, could provide\r\nopportunities to developing countries, especially the\r\nleast developed countries, to create innovative\r\nmedicine to further develop their countries and catch\r\nup with the developed world. Nevertheless, the world\r\nquickly realized that ICTs could also widen the gap\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries by\r\ncreating a digital divide. The Secretary-General of the\r\nInternational Telecommunication Union recently\r\nreported that, while more than 60 per cent of\r\nhouseholds in the Republic of Korea are enjoying\r\nbroadband internet connections, there are 61 countries\r\nwhich have less than one internet user for every 100\r\ncitizens. The digital divide, if not carefully and\r\npromptly addressed, could further marginalize the\r\ndeveloping countries. In this regard, the United Nations\r\nhas an important role in coordinating global efforts to\r\naddress this gap.\r\nMalaysia welcomes the launching by the\r\nSecretary-General on 21 November 2001 of the United\r\nNations Information and Communication Technologies\r\nTask Force as an enabling factor in the building of a\r\npoverty-free world. We hope that the ICT Task Force\r\nwill catalyse the bridging of the global digital divide\r\nand foster digital opportunity that would put ICTs at\r\nthe service of development for all. Sustainable\r\ndevelopment on a global scale requires accelerated\r\ntransfer of knowledge and technology, especially ICTs,\r\nto developing countries from developed countries.\r\nIt has been almost a year since the establishment\r\nof this new body. The third meeting of the ICT Task\r\nForce was held recently to review its work for the past\r\nyear. My delegation is pleased that the ICT Task Force,\r\nalthough only one year old, is proceeding well in\r\ncarrying out its responsibility to build the digital bridge\r\nto the billions of people outside the domain of the\r\ndigital revolution. We note that the third meeting, inter\r\nalia, reaffirmed the validity of a multi-stakeholder\r\napproach and agreed to continue to apply ICTs to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, to focus\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\non Africa and to contribute effectively to the World\r\nSummit on the Information Society (WSIS).\r\nThe holding of the WSIS in Geneva from 10 to 12\r\nDecember 2003 and in Tunis in 2005 will be an\r\nimportant event in the history of mankind. One of the\r\npurposes of the WSIS is to come up with a vision: an\r\nunderstanding of the information society. ICT, with its\r\nwarp speed, is changing the international community\r\nwithout our realizing it. Many of us take for granted,\r\nfor instance, what our personal computer and the\r\nInternet can do for us. We only realize its importance\r\nwhen there is a disruption of our local area network or\r\nwhen a malicious virus attacks our personal computer.\r\nThese are simple analogies, but they clearly illustrate\r\nhow ICT is affecting our daily lives. The applications\r\nof ICTs, such as in e-government, e-medicine and\r\neducation, would facilitate the implementation of\r\nbroader social and economic goals, such as the\r\neradication of poverty. As such, it is important that the\r\nhuman race understand this revolution so as to enable\r\nus to address the challenges and exploit its\r\nopportunities.\r\nClearly, the greatest challenge is to bridge the\r\ndigital divide and foster digital opportunity for all\r\nmankind. This message was lucidly transmitted at the\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly devoted to\r\ninformation and communication technologies for\r\ndevelopment, held on 17 and 18 June 2002 in New\r\nYork. It is important that this political message be\r\ntranslated resonantly at the WSIS process so as to\r\nprovide for a resolute and coherent programme of\r\naction for implementation by Governments,\r\ninternational institutions and all sectors of civil society\r\nto the benefit of all mankind.\r\nThe WSIS is the next world gathering that will\r\nshape international cooperation at the multilateral\r\nlevel. Genuine international cooperation is essential to\r\nensure real, tangible and sustained transfer of\r\nknowledge and ICTs to developing countries.\r\nInformation represents a powerful tool to enrich and\r\nempower all humankind, as a knowledgeable society\r\nwould generate more benefits for the peoples of the\r\nworld. Our leaders, at the Millennium Summit, hoped\r\nfor the right of universal access to information and\r\ncommunication technology. The developed countries\r\nmust therefore assist the developing countries in their\r\nefforts to develop these technologies, as embodied in\r\nthe Millennium Declaration agreed to by our leaders.\r\nThe work of the ICT Task Force and the Group of 8\r\nDigital Opportunity Task Force will be critical in this\r\nregard. Malaysia looks forward to participating in the\r\nsecond Preparatory Committee meeting for the WSIS\r\nin Geneva from 24 March to 4 April 2003.\r\nKnowledge has become a factor for change. The\r\nGovernment of Malaysia, since the early 1990s, has\r\nembarked on a quest to transform Malaysians into a\r\nknowledge society. In our quest to transform our\r\nsociety to adapt to the information age, we have also\r\nrealized the importance of bridging the information and\r\ndigital gap between local communities. The number of\r\nInternet users in Malaysia increased four-fold — or\r\n400 per cent — from 1.6 million in 1998 to 6.5 million\r\nin 2001. We expect the number to surge to 10 million\r\nnext year. Nevertheless, what is more critical is to\r\nfoster the use of the technology so that all segments of\r\nsociety may grasp the opportunities emerging from the\r\ninformation age. Malaysia stands ready to contribute\r\nwithin our capabilities towards promoting international\r\ncooperation in the area of information and\r\ncommunication technologies, especially among the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe United Nations is well positioned to take a\r\nlead role in shaping the global ICT vision for\r\ndevelopment. In this regard, Malaysia views the\r\nholding of the meeting of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to information and communication\r\ntechnologies for development, at the initiative of the\r\nRepublic of Korea, as particularly important and\r\ntimely. It was the first time that the General Assembly\r\ndevoted a meeting to the issue and the meeting, among\r\nother things, provided political impetus on the need not\r\nonly to bridge the existing global digital divide, but\r\nalso to avert further widening of the digital divide.\r\nOtherwise, developing countries will be further\r\nmarginalized in the information age by the\r\nglobalization wave.\r\nMr. Escanero (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation welcomes the introduction of document\r\nA/57/280, entitled “Meeting of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to information and communication\r\ntechnologies for development — Summary by the\r\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly”.\r\nAt that meeting, my delegation noted that\r\ninformation and communication technologies are\r\ndecisive factors in creating a world economy based on\r\nknowledge, which we must build around a new concept\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nof development with a human face; that there was a\r\nneed to mobilize these technologies to accelerate\r\ngrowth, increase competitiveness, promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment, eradicate poverty and its extreme and\r\nharmful manifestations, and facilitate effective\r\nintegration in all countries; and that it was necessary to\r\nconsider the various aspects and actions to reduce or\r\neliminate obstacles that hinder the participation of\r\ndeveloping countries and their broad access to such\r\ntechnologies.\r\nThe delegation of Mexico wishes to take this\r\nopportunity to reiterate the importance my country\r\nattaches to the holding of the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society, and consequently to all activities\r\nthat strengthen the appeal by the international\r\ncommunity for this ambitious meeting to take place.\r\nWe therefore welcome the resolution that has been\r\ntabled on this subject in the Second Committee by the\r\ndelegations of Tunisia and Switzerland.\r\nThe resolution emphasizes the activities that have\r\nbeen carried out by the United Nations, the\r\nInternational Telecommunication Union and other\r\ninternational forums in support of the preparatory\r\nprocess leading to the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society.\r\nWe urge all countries to intensify their work at\r\nthe international and national levels, and United\r\nNations agencies, inter-governmental organizations and\r\ninternational institutions to step up their cooperation as\r\npart of the preparatory process for the Summit, as well\r\nas their support for it.\r\nWith reference to the operative paragraphs of the\r\nabove-mentioned resolution, the Mexican delegation\r\nwishes to insist on one point that we consider key —\r\ncooperation in the preparatory process that would lead\r\nto the Summit. My delegation recognizes the specific\r\ninterest shown by some countries, as well as some\r\ninternational bodies and institutions, to work towards\r\nan information society that could become an effective\r\nlink in the transfer of knowledge and at the same time\r\ncontribute to the reducing of the development gap\r\namong countries.\r\nMexico notes, however, with concern that these\r\nefforts may not be realized in the context of the\r\ndeliberations taking place in the working sub-groups of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee in Geneva. We consider it\r\nessential for activities and meetings related to the\r\nSummit to take place in a framework of\r\ncomplementarity. Thus these initiatives that are no\r\ndoubt of value may help increase the value-added of\r\nthe work of the Preparatory Committee, especially in\r\nrespect to the holding of regional meetings.\r\nIn view of the above, the Mexican delegation\r\nwishes to invite countries, inter-governmental bodies\r\nand international institutions to strengthen the work of\r\nthe Preparatory Committee for the Summit which will\r\nmake it possible to make progress in a coordinated,\r\neffective and comprehensive manner towards the\r\nobjectives of the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety.\r\nMs. Viotti (Brazil): Information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICTs) have become one\r\nof the main elements of globalization. These new\r\ntechnologies are so important that we have even\r\ncreated a new concept: “information society”, to\r\ndescribe all the changes they have brought about. In\r\nfact, the spread of ICTs have far-reaching\r\nconsequences. In that connection Brazil put in place\r\nthree years ago an information society programme that\r\nadopts a multi-sector approach encompassing areas\r\nsuch as education, health, trade and Government.\r\nGiven the priority it attaches to this area, Brazil is\r\ntaking active part in the preparatory process of the\r\nWorld Summit on Information Society to be held in\r\nGeneva and Tunis. As an inter-governmental forum of\r\nuniversal composition, the Summit will be well placed\r\nto look at the issues from different angles and take\r\ndecisions whose legitimacy will gain from broad\r\nparticipation. This is especially important, since\r\nnowadays many decisions, in particular on policy\r\nissues, are taken by forums of limited membership\r\nwithout adequate representation on the part of\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe economic field is the first to come to mind\r\nwhen we refer to this new concept. ICTs have given\r\nrise to innovation and dynamism, reshaping the way we\r\nproduce goods and services, and trade them. An\r\nenterprise can hardly be competitive without the use of\r\nICTs in its activities.\r\nAnother important area where ICTs have proved\r\nessential is Government. In Brazil, for instance, ICTs\r\nhave allowed us to improve Government services and\r\nstrengthen democracy, citizenship and the rule of law.\r\nIncome tax declarations, for instance, can be made on-\r\nline, avoiding cumbersome bureaucratic procedures.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.43\r\nInformation on Government procurement can be\r\nobtained on the Internet, ensuring transparency.\r\nAn even more important example is the use of\r\nICTs in the electoral process. The Brazilian presidential\r\nelections, held on October 6 and 27, were conducted\r\nentirely through electronic voting, including in the\r\nmost remote rural areas. This system avoids fraud,\r\nstrengthens legitimacy and allows for a fast and\r\nreliable vote count. In spite of a large electorate of 115\r\nmillion voters the results were announced shortly after\r\nthe end of the voting. Moreover, the clarity and\r\nsimplicity of the electronic system contributed to a\r\nreduction of nearly fifty per cent in the number of\r\nblank and spoiled votes.\r\nICTs must also be looked at from a social and\r\ncultural perspective. In this regard, our information\r\nsociety programme aims at spreading the use of ICTs to\r\nall segments of the population by developing local\r\ncontent, interconnecting libraries and universities, and\r\npromoting distance-learning. It is with great\r\nsatisfaction that we have witnessed, for instance, a\r\nsharp increase in the number of Internet users and\r\ndomain names over the last three years.\r\nICTs have become such a powerful tool that that\r\ncan either help narrow the gap between developing and\r\ndeveloped countries or further increase the distance\r\nbetween them. This is the great challenge that lies\r\nahead: how can we tap into the potential offered by\r\nICTs?\r\nThe answer has both national and international\r\ncomponents. At the national level, Governments must\r\nput in place public policies that stimulate research into\r\nICTs and disseminate the results of that research. The\r\nimportance of partnerships between Government, the\r\nprivate sector and universities cannot be\r\noveremphasized.\r\nAt the international level, cooperation is crucial\r\nto bridge the digital divide. Brazil has taken part\r\nactively in multilateral forums, such as the Group of 15\r\nand the Rio Group, and followed closely the\r\ndevelopments of other initiatives dealing with\r\ninformation technologies, such as the DOT Force.\r\nFurthermore, Brazil is a member of the United Nations\r\nInformation and Communication Technologies Task\r\nForce since its inception.\r\nThe potential for North-South and South-South\r\ncooperation is vast and still unexplored. All relevant\r\nactors should join efforts to promote, for example,\r\ntransfer of technology, investment in infrastructure and\r\ncapacity building. In promoting partnerships, we\r\nshould also avoid a commercial approach and not lose\r\nsight of our development priorities.\r\nThe World Summit on the Information Society\r\nwill give us the opportunity to intensify this\r\ncooperation. Although we are aware that ICTs can be\r\nlooked at from a number of important angles, we\r\nbelieve that development should be the priority of the\r\nSummit. If we succeed in pursuing vigorous policies\r\nand in setting up strong partnerships, the information\r\nsociety will become not only a concept with which to\r\nunderstand the world we live in but also an instrument\r\nto transform this world, making it possible for all\r\ncountries to quickly advance to new stages of\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
