(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Nguyen Thanh\r\nChau (Viet Nam), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 24 (continued)\r\nCulture of peace\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.12)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nGeneral Assembly held the debate on this agenda item\r\nat its 43rd plenary meeting, on Monday, 4 November\r\n2002, and adopted draft resolution A/57/L.9/Rev.1,\r\nwhich became resolution 57/6.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Pakistan\r\nto introduce draft resolution A/57/L.12, entitled\r\n“Religious and cultural understanding, harmony and\r\ncooperation”.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): I have the honour to\r\nintroduce, on behalf of the delegations of Bahrain,\r\nChina, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon,\r\nMalaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, the United\r\nArab Emirates and my own delegation, the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/57/L.12, proposing\r\nthe adoption of a draft Declaration on Religious and\r\nCultural Understanding, Harmony and Cooperation.\r\nSince the end of the cold war, there has been a\r\nresurgence of religious and cultural intolerance in\r\nvarious parts of the world. The rise of xenophobia and\r\nof religious and racial intolerance and discrimination in\r\na number of developed countries has been accompanied\r\nby the rise of anti-migrant political parties. Some of the\r\npost-cold war conflicts and disputes have been caused\r\nby religious intolerance and antipathy. In certain cases,\r\nlong-standing disputes and conflicts have become\r\nincreasingly linked to religious identity and have often\r\nbeen exacerbated by religious fervour. That has made\r\nconflict resolution more difficult.\r\nThe mutual misunderstanding and suspicion\r\namong followers of various faiths and cultures have\r\nbecome significantly accentuated in the aftermath of\r\nthe tragic terrorist attacks of last September. Despite\r\ndeclarations by world leaders that the war against\r\nterrorism is not targeted against any religion or any\r\nreligious or social group, discrimination, mistreatment\r\nand hate have proliferated. That has been highlighted\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report (A/57/204) on\r\nmeasures to combat contemporary forms of racism,\r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related\r\nintolerance. Unfortunately, some simplistic academic\r\nanalyses and theories, projecting a clash of\r\ncivilizations, have provided a veneer of respectability\r\nto the practice and profession of religious and cultural\r\ndiscrimination and intolerance. In recent months, some\r\nextremists have gone to the extent of attacking Islamic\r\nreligious teachings and insulting revered religious\r\npersonalities. Such prejudice, hate and blasphemy have\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nevoked justifiable and widespread anger among the\r\nadherents of Islam.\r\nIn some States interested groups are exploiting\r\npopular misperceptions of Islam and Muslims to justify\r\ninstitutional and individual acts of discrimination and\r\nrepression against Muslim minorities or Muslim\r\npeoples under the guise of fighting terrorism. There is a\r\ngrowing negative public reaction in the Islamic\r\ncountries to these practices.\r\nThese dangerous patterns and practices of\r\ndiscrimination, intolerance and hatred on the basis of\r\nreligion and culture must be addressed squarely and\r\nreversed effectively by the international community.\r\nOtherwise, they could become institutionalized and,\r\nworse, emerge as the norm in certain countries. As a\r\nresult of such bigotry and bias, conflicts and disputes\r\nin various parts of the world are likely to become\r\nfurther exacerbated.\r\nReligious and cultural diversity in the globalizing\r\nworld needs to be seen as a vehicle for complimentary\r\ncreativity and dynamism and not as the rationale for a\r\nnew ideological and political confrontation. Respect,\r\nacceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of the\r\nworld’s cultures have to be fostered by openness,\r\ncommunication, freedom of thought, and knowledge. A\r\nsustained interaction between the world’s religions and\r\ncultures is an indispensable avenue through which we\r\ncan lift the veil of ignorance, misconception and\r\nprejudice that have become so tragically manifest in\r\nrecent times.\r\nIn his address to the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly, the President of\r\nPakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, proposed the\r\nadoption of a Declaration on Religious and Cultural\r\nUnderstanding, Harmony and Cooperation by the\r\nGeneral Assembly as a first step in promoting dialogue\r\nand mutual understanding. Accordingly, the Pakistani\r\ndelegation, together with the sponsors, have presented\r\nthe draft resolution and Declaration contained in\r\nA/57/L.12. This proposal has the endorsement, in\r\nprinciple, of the member States of the Organization of\r\nthe Islamic Conference.\r\nThe proposal draws upon the considerable work\r\nwhich has already been done towards promoting\r\nmutual understanding, tolerance and dialogue among\r\nreligions and cultures. The United Nations Commission\r\non Human Rights, as well as the General Assembly,\r\nhave adopted several resolutions on the subject of\r\ndefamation of religions and elimination of all forms of\r\nreligious intolerance. The Assembly has recognized,\r\nunder resolution 56/6 of 9 November 2001, the\r\nvaluable contribution which a dialogue among\r\ncivilizations could make to enhance mutual awareness\r\nand understanding of the common values shared by all\r\nmankind. The United Nations Educational Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization’s Declaration of Principles\r\nof Tolerance, adopted in 1995, calls for the promotion\r\nof tolerance through programmes and institutions in the\r\nfields of education, science, culture and\r\ncommunication. The Declaration on a Culture of Peace,\r\nadopted by the General Assembly at its fifty-third\r\nsession, links the development of a culture of peace to\r\nthe elimination of discrimination and advocates the\r\nadvancement of understanding, tolerance and solidarity\r\namong all civilizations, peoples and cultures, including\r\ntowards ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.\r\nMany faith-based forums, governmental and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and intellectual and\r\nacademic institutions, have sought to promote\r\ninterfaith dialogue and understanding. These initiatives\r\nand processes need to be unified and harmonized to\r\neffectively arrest and reverse the disturbing tendencies\r\nand manifestations of religious intolerance,\r\nconfrontation and discrimination.\r\nThe draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/57/L.12 is simple and procedural. While expressing\r\nconcern at the resurgence of religious and cultural\r\nprejudices, and calling for the benevolent use of\r\nreligious and cultural diversity, it seeks endorsement of\r\nthe annexed draft Declaration.\r\nThe draft Declaration, in its preambular part,\r\nrecalls the relevant resolutions and important\r\ninternational instruments, reaffirms State obligations,\r\nexpresses concern at intolerance and prejudice and\r\nstresses the need to stamp out hate.\r\nIn its operative part, the draft Declaration calls\r\nfor promotion and protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms and facilitation of the\r\nparticipation of minorities in the political economic,\r\nsocial, religious and cultural life of societies. It\r\ndenounces acts of intolerance, discrimination,\r\nstereotyping, racial profiling, bigotry and\r\nhatemongering in all their manifestations.\r\nThe draft Declaration welcomes the meaningful\r\ncontributions of non-governmental organizations and\r\ncivil society, particularly faith-based organizations, in\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nbuilding a culture of tolerance, understanding and\r\nrespect for other faiths and cultures. These\r\norganizations are invited to promote interfaith\r\ninteraction at all levels.\r\nThe United Nations, as the most representative\r\ninternational forum, is best placed to coordinate and\r\noversee international and intersocietal interaction and\r\ncooperation, as envisaged in the draft Declaration. The\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\r\nis requested to promote, within his mandate,\r\nimplementation and follow up of the provisions of the\r\ndraft Declaration and to coordinate the activities\r\nrelated to promotion of religious and cultural harmony,\r\nunderstanding and cooperation.\r\nThe sponsors of this draft resolution and\r\nDeclaration in document A/57/L.12 will hold open\r\nended informal consultations in the first week of\r\nDecember, with a view to evolving a document which\r\ncould be approved by consensus by the Assembly.\r\nThe adoption of this draft Declaration will be a\r\ntimely, authoritative and global rejection of the\r\nmessage of intolerance, hate and discrimination being\r\npurveyed by certain bigots and belligerents. Its\r\nadoption by the Assembly will also be an important\r\ncontribution to advancing the goal of religious and\r\ncultural understanding and harmony, as well as to\r\npromoting the goals of universal peace, security and\r\nprosperity.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will\r\nresume its consideration of agenda item 32 entitled\r\n“Information and communication technologies for\r\ndevelopment”. Members will recall that the General\r\nAssembly began its debate on this agenda item at the\r\nforty-third plenary meeting on Monday, 4 November\r\n2002.\r\nMr. Helg (Switzerland) (spoke in English): The\r\nworld has become a much smaller place, due to the\r\nnew technical facilities and the tremendously increased\r\nspeed with which we can communicate across borders\r\nand continents. Information and communication\r\ntechnologies (ICT) permit us to transport signals for\r\ntext, sound and pictures at the very same time.\r\nWhatever happens anywhere in the world is known\r\nimmediately all over the globe, at least potentially.\r\nIt is clear, however, that ICTs have a far greater\r\nimpact than simply speeding up and facilitating the\r\nexchange of information. They have transformed the\r\nway we deal with and value information and\r\nknowledge, emphasizing knowledge as structural\r\ncapital of institutions and companies. Rightly, we speak\r\ntoday of the knowledge economy or k-economy.\r\nICT has the potential to bring about qualitative\r\nchanges in many areas. For instance, they are having an\r\nimpact on the way in which the State and other\r\nstakeholders interact — thus touching on issues of\r\ngovernance, democracy, human rights, public services\r\nand so on.\r\nJust like the industrial revolution, the digital\r\nrevolution also has its beneficiaries and those not yet\r\nbenefiting, thus creating what is termed the digital\r\ndivide. A sharp digital divide exists between the north\r\nand the south, but we should also keep in mind that\r\nthere are multiple digital divides in almost all countries\r\nand societies — for instance, between the sexes,\r\nbetween old and young, between cultures, and between\r\nthe private sector and Governments.\r\nFrom the perspective of those who are not yet on\r\nthe winning side of the digital divide, the consequences\r\nare major. The challenge is to turn the digital divide\r\ninto digital dividends. ICT has the potential to be a\r\npowerful tool for sustainable development and poverty\r\nalleviation and to contribute towards achieving the\r\nUnited Nations Millennium Development Goals. But in\r\norder for this to happen, the right enabling\r\nenvironments need to be put in place and considerable\r\nefforts made.\r\nThe practical question is: What are the right\r\nframeworks? What are the right efforts? Where are the\r\nentry points that will allow the impact of projects and\r\nprogrammes to be maximized? It is obvious that no\r\ndigital dividend can be realized without the appropriate\r\ninfrastructure and technology or without addressing\r\nrelated costs. But connectivity alone is not enough. It\r\nneeds to be accompanied by capacity-building and\r\ninstitutional strengthening. To close in-country digital\r\nand information divides, it will be necessary to find\r\nways to include poor and marginalized communities.\r\nYoung people and women may play important roles in\r\nmultiplying the impact of our efforts. Local and\r\ncontextualized information, indigenous knowledge, and\r\ncommunication rules and rights are additional\r\nimportant aspects of a future global and equitable\r\ninformation society.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nOtherwise, access to the Internet may create new\r\ndivides — for example, if the countries of the South\r\nsimply become consumers of the information produced\r\nand owned by the North. In our view, it is imperative to\r\npromote the production and exchange of local content,\r\nbased on local cultures and languages. Thus,\r\ndeveloping countries in particular need to formulate\r\ntheir own vision of an information society, taking into\r\naccount the particularities of their regions and\r\nsocieties.\r\nNo progress will be made, however, without\r\nadequate and functioning financing mechanisms for\r\nprojects aimed at bridging the digital divide. The\r\nfinancing models need to strike an appropriate balance\r\nbetween liberalization and public-service obligations to\r\nensure that the poor will benefit as well. Appropriate\r\npolicy and regulatory frameworks at the global,\r\nregional, national and local levels will also enhance the\r\ninitiatives taken by Governments and individuals.\r\nOn the implementation side, the task of creating\r\ndigital dividends cannot be left to Governments, donor\r\nagencies and international organizations alone; it must\r\ninvolve civil society, the private sector, academia and\r\nICT professionals. All of them have important roles to\r\nplay. Only a multi-stakeholder approach will ensure\r\nthat all levels of society, including the grass-roots\r\nlevel, are shaping the efforts to bridge this divide.\r\nSimilarly, there is a need for South-South and South-\r\nNorth information exchange and cooperation on\r\npractical experiences in using ICT for development.\r\nThe voices of developing countries need to be heard\r\nand strengthened in the global policy dialogue.\r\nThe Swiss authorities recognized the importance\r\nof ICT as a tool in development work early on and\r\ntasked its Agency for Development and Cooperation\r\nwith working on this matter. The Agency participated\r\nactively in the first Global Knowledge Conference in\r\n1997 and created a special unit dedicated to “ICT for\r\ndevelopment”. In 2001, the head of the Swiss\r\nDevelopment Agency was also elected to the position\r\nof Chairman of the Global Knowledge Partnership\r\n(GKP). GKP is an evolving network with a broad-\r\nbased and multisectoral membership, aimed at sharing\r\ninformation and knowledge on the use of ICT for\r\nsustainable development. It enhances advocacy at the\r\nregional and global levels in order to make the voices\r\nof marginalized stakeholders heard; it also offers its\r\nmembers services through its virtual presence, the\r\nmarketplace or its newsletter and publications, along\r\nwith opportunities for face-to-face networking and\r\nknowledge-sharing sessions.\r\nBased on its general engagement in the area of\r\nICT for development, the Swiss Government is taking\r\nan active stance in the preparatory process for the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society, which will\r\ntake place in Geneva in December 2003 and in Tunis in\r\n2005. It advocates an inclusive participation that\r\nextends to civil society, the private sector and other\r\nstakeholders and supports the concept of a series of\r\nnetworked events. An architecture that complements\r\nthe intergovernmental Summit with official platforms\r\nin parallel will enhance the possibility of all voices\r\nbeing heard.\r\nSimilarly, it champions a holistic approach to the\r\nthematic discussions. The Summit needs to go beyond\r\ntelecommunications-related technical issues in order to\r\nmove closer to an equitable and global information\r\nsociety that is based on shared values and cultural\r\ndiversity. The Summit must explore and recommend\r\npractical steps and concrete measures encouraging\r\npoverty-focused uses of ICT for development and\r\nempowerment.\r\nThe beginnings of the new ICT and Internet age\r\nwere marked by a spirit of endless possibilities,\r\nfreedom of communication, by the conviction that\r\nsharing information and knowledge is beneficial to all\r\nand by the use of such phrases as “sharing makes us\r\nricher” or “knowledge is not only renewable, it grows\r\nwith use.” We must all work to extend these benefits to\r\neveryone and fully to realize the potential of ICT to\r\nalleviate poverty, create jobs and invest in a future that\r\noffers perspectives.\r\nMr. Lee Ho-jin (Republic of Korea): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express my delegation’s\r\nsatisfaction at the constructive contribution of the\r\nMeeting of the General Assembly devoted to\r\ninformation and communication technologies (ICT) for\r\ndevelopment held in June. As reflected by the high-\r\nlevel participation of stakeholders representing the\r\ninternational community, the private sector and civil\r\nsociety from all over the world, the Meeting fulfilled\r\none of its primary goals of promoting awareness and\r\nraising the political profile of the multifaceted issues\r\nsurrounding ICT. We sincerely hope that the\r\ninternational community will make efforts to sustain\r\nand utilize this momentum until the upcoming World\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nSummit on the Information Society, to be held in 2003\r\nand 2005.\r\nAs the President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-sixth session stated in his summary of the\r\nMeeting, the need to effectively integrate ICTs into\r\ndevelopment in a timely manner is urgent, as every\r\npassing day the digital divide grows wider and\r\nbecomes more difficult to bridge. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation would like to commend the ICT Task Force\r\nand the Digital Opportunities Task Force for their\r\nefforts to engage intergovernmental and international\r\norganizations, as well as the private sector and civil\r\nsociety, in promoting digital opportunities. Indeed, if\r\nwe are to achieve progress in tackling this challenging\r\nissue, we must pool resources and knowledge across all\r\nsectors of society in a collaborative and cooperative\r\napproach.\r\nAn effective partnership between those countries\r\nwith and those without ICT infrastructure, experience\r\nand knowledge is one essential element in ensuring that\r\nall the countries of the world have an equal opportunity\r\nto benefit from ICTs. In that regard, the Republic of\r\nKorea remains committed to sharing its unique\r\nexperience and expertise with developing nations.\r\nAs my Minister of Information and\r\nCommunications stated at the meeting in June, the\r\nRepublic of Korea itself took advantage of digital\r\nopportunities to rise from a newly industrialized\r\ndeveloping nation to the world’s twelfth-largest\r\neconomy and a global leader in ICTs. By enacting a\r\ncomprehensive information promotion plan, the Korean\r\nGovernment made ICTs a national priority, building an\r\nICT infrastructure and adopting programmes that\r\nintegrated ICTs into all regions, sectors and socio-\r\neconomic classes of Korean society.\r\nAs my country has learned first-hand, superior\r\nhuman resources are crucial to the development of a\r\nknowledge-based economy. Indeed, the Republic of\r\nKorea owes much of its development to its highly\r\neducated workforce. Acknowledging this, the Korean\r\nGovernment has continuously implemented human\r\nresources development programmes so as to produce a\r\ngeneration of ICT-savvy Koreans. The Government’s\r\nefforts to foster creativity and growth in the private\r\nsector by promoting market principles such as\r\ncompetition, liberalization, deregulation and\r\nprivatization have been another key. A third strategy\r\nthat the Korean Government has adopted is to give\r\npriority to the inducement of foreign direct investment\r\nand international cooperation. As a result of its active\r\npursuit of foreign direct investment, Korea has\r\nbenefited from an influx of capital and advanced\r\ntechnology, as well as of improved management skills\r\nand better jobs. Moreover, the Korean Government\r\ncontinues to actively seek opportunities for\r\ninternational cooperation through ICT-related global\r\nand regional initiatives.\r\nSince ICTs have become an increasingly\r\nimportant tool in the development process, the\r\nRepublic of Korea has joined in the efforts of the\r\ninternational community to help bridge the digital\r\ndivide with human resources and infrastructure\r\ndevelopment projects in the field of ICTs, through both\r\nbilateral and multilateral channels, such as the United\r\nNations regional commissions.\r\nUtilizing a trust fund, Korea has contributed to\r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa and the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific. The Korean Government is currently\r\nimplementing various projects, such as the\r\nestablishment of regional information and\r\ntelecommunications centres and ICT human resources\r\ntraining programmes, and the creation of cyber-\r\neducation networks, particularly in Africa and in\r\ndeveloping countries elsewhere. Since 1991, we have\r\ninvited about 1,200 foreign trainees in the ICT field to\r\nparticipate in human resources development\r\nprogrammes in Korea and have dispatched more than\r\n600 Korean ICT experts and volunteers to implement\r\nprogrammes abroad.\r\nMy delegation would like, however, to\r\nunderscore that partnerships among those countries,\r\nwith or without ICT resources, are only one of the keys\r\nto successfully bridging the digital divide. The active\r\nparticipation of the private sector and the engagement\r\nof civil society are also essential to, inter alia,\r\npromoting economic growth, ensuring social progress,\r\nbolstering the fight against global pandemics and\r\nreducing gender inequalities through digital\r\nopportunity. Moreover, my delegation strongly\r\nsupports the exploration of regional coordination and\r\nSouth-South cooperation, by which the developing\r\nnations would be able to share valuable experience and\r\nbest practices.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nAs the ICT industry develops, the international\r\ncommunity has the obligation not only to spread digital\r\nopportunities such as e-commerce and e-government,\r\nbut also to prevent and counter the misuse of such\r\nopportunities in the new arena of cybercrime. My\r\ndelegation strongly believes that the international\r\ncommunity should collaborate by exchanging\r\ninformation, establishing a legal framework and\r\ndeveloping expertise and technology to counter this\r\nnew security threat.\r\nIn closing, I would like to express the hope of my\r\ndelegation that the United Nations will continue to play\r\nits crucial role in bringing the key stakeholders\r\ntogether to promote awareness of ICTs and to develop\r\nand implement strategies for bridging the digital\r\ndivide. We are confident that the forthcoming World\r\nSummit on the Information Society in 2003 and 2005\r\nwill provide a significant opportunity for such multi-\r\nstakeholder collaboration and cooperation. For its part,\r\nthe Republic of Korea remains committed to these\r\ngoals and looks forward to sharing its experience and\r\nworking collaboratively to create digital opportunity\r\nfor all.\r\nMr. Mizukami (Japan): It is a pleasure for me to\r\nspeak on agenda item 32, “Information and\r\ncommunication technologies for development”, at this\r\nplenary meeting. Japan attaches great importance to\r\npromoting international cooperation in the area of\r\ninformation and communication technologies (ICTs).\r\nWe have actively availed ourselves of all the\r\nopportunities that have been presented for further\r\ndiscussion on this subject. At the United Nations, the\r\nissue was first addressed at the high-level segment of\r\nthe substantive session of the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil in 2000. We would also like to mention the\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly devoted to\r\ninformation and communication technologies for\r\ndevelopment. For two full days, more than 50 Member\r\nStates engaged in a very constructive discussion on the\r\nopportunities and challenges posed by the development\r\nof ICTs.\r\nWe are witnessing the most important structural\r\ntransformation in the world since the industrial\r\nrevolution. Although at times the information\r\ntechnology (IT) industry may be affected by economic\r\nconditions, this is a phenomenon that cannot be\r\nreversed. For years to come, ICTs will remain a\r\nfundamental, if not indispensable, infrastructure. In\r\nthat regard, it is important to create an information\r\nsociety in which everyone receives the full benefit of\r\nICTs and uses those technologies as a basis for\r\ndevelopment. ICTs must serve as a means of\r\naccelerating development, not widening the economic\r\ngap.\r\nIn order to receive the full benefits of ICTs, we\r\nalso need to consider the issue of cybersecurity. Once\r\nconnected, no person or country is immune from the\r\nthreat of cyberterrorism. As the importance of\r\ninformation and networks increase, so does the\r\npotential damage caused by cyberterrorism. The cost to\r\nsociety may be serious enough to adversely affect the\r\ndevelopment effort. For that reason, my Government\r\nactively involved itself in the drafting of the Guidelines\r\nfor the Security of Information Systems and Networks:\r\nTowards a Culture of Security adopted by the\r\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD) and joined the United States in\r\nsponsoring draft resolution A/C.2/57/L.10, introduced\r\nin the Second Committee and entitled “Creation of a\r\nglobal culture of cybersecurity,” which is based on the\r\nOECD Guidelines. We would like to call upon all\r\nMember States to support that very important draft\r\nresolution, which addresses an issue of critical\r\nimportance to every country in the world.\r\nWhile we actively engage in discussions in the\r\ninterest of exchanging views and raising awareness, we\r\nare also committed to assisting through action on the\r\nground. Japan has made both bilateral and multilateral\r\ncontributions, emphasizing cooperation with\r\ninternational organizations. Its $5 million contribution\r\nto the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) thematic trust fund for ICTs is an example of\r\nits multilateral cooperation in this area. The fund,\r\nfinanced mostly by Japan, enables the UNDP to make\r\nfull use of its expertise in order to draft and implement\r\nprojects, with the objective of realizing the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe World Summit on the Information Society\r\nwill be held in 2003 in Geneva and in 2005 in Tunis.\r\nWe commend the International Telecommunication\r\nUnion (ITU), which from the outset has played an\r\nimportant role in this area. Japan is determined to\r\ncontinue its support for the Summit, which takes many\r\nforms and is provided at several levels. From 13\r\nthrough 15 January 2003, my Government will host the\r\nAsian Regional Conference for the World Summit on\r\nthe Information Society. Through this ministerial\r\npreparatory meeting in Tokyo, the countries of the\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nregion can discuss their interests and views and shape\r\nthem into proposals for the Summit. The Conference\r\nwill afford Summit participants a good opportunity to\r\ndirectly exchange views and deepen their\r\nunderstanding of the issues. Invitations have been sent\r\nto Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP) member States in the region and to\r\ninternational organizations, and the business sector and\r\ncivil society are also expected to participate. We\r\nwelcome the active cooperation of the United Nations\r\nsystem, especially the co-sponsors, namely, ESCAP,\r\nITU, UNDP, and the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\r\nWe have repeatedly heard that ICTs are only a\r\nmeans and not an end. While we agree that this is so,\r\nwe should not mistakenly draw the conclusion that they\r\nare of any less importance. Without the means, we\r\ncannot achieve the goals that we have agreed on. We\r\ntherefore should give serious consideration as to how\r\nwe can use this tool most effectively. We hope that the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society and its\r\npreparatory process will allow us to do that.\r\nMr. Alcalay (Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Just\r\na few days ago, from 27 to 30 October 2002, in\r\naccordance with the mandate of the first South Summit\r\nof heads of State or Government of the Group of 77,\r\nwe held, in the city of Dubai in the United Arab\r\nEmirates, the first Group of 77 High-Level Conference\r\non Science and Technology. There, thanks to the\r\nsupport of our host, Government representatives and\r\nscientists from the developing world gathered together\r\nto meet on three themes that are of fundamental\r\nimportance for the developing world: information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICTs); biotechnology;\r\nand the supply of drinking water.\r\nSince we are dealing today with the question of\r\ninformation and communication technologies, allow\r\nme, on behalf of the Group of 77, to make a few brief\r\ncomments concerning the conclusions reached by the\r\nrepresentatives of the countries of our Group, which\r\nwill be issued as an official document of the United\r\nNations. The Dubai Declaration will contribute to the\r\npromotion of science and technology in the South.\r\nIn the Declaration, we reaffirm our commitment\r\nto implement specific, concrete plans of action at the\r\nnational and international levels, with a view to\r\npromoting and developing knowledge and technology\r\nin the South, and to promoting the central role of the\r\nUnited Nations in removing the barriers faced by the\r\ndeveloping world in acquiring knowledge and\r\ntechnology, particularly in the area of ICTs, which can\r\nenable us to promote development.\r\nDespite the fact that it focuses on South-South\r\ncooperation, the Dubai Declaration recognizes that\r\ncooperation with developed countries is needed in\r\norder to achieve the necessary level of scientific and\r\ntechnological development, as mentioned by previous\r\nspeakers, particularly the representative of Korea, who\r\nstressed not only South-South cooperation but also the\r\ndevelopment of South-South-North cooperation.\r\nFor that reason, it is a great honour for me to say\r\non behalf of the Group of 77 how happy we are that the\r\nGeneral Assembly is considering the question of\r\ninformation and communication technologies. But we\r\nbelieve it necessary for the Assembly to move towards\r\nproductive, effective action that would enable us\r\nbetween next year and 2005 to come up with a concrete\r\nstrategy to further develop this cooperation.\r\nThe rapid scientific and technological advances\r\nof recent years, above all in sectors such as micro-\r\nelectronics, biotechnology and information technology,\r\nshould give impetus to efforts to achieve world\r\neconomic and social development, particularly for the\r\npoorest countries. ICTs are a factor that, if used to\r\npromote the Millennium Development Goals, will\r\nclearly enable us to provide hundreds of millions of the\r\nworld’s people with the possibility of promoting\r\nequality in the field of growth and economic\r\ndevelopment, reducing disparities between developed\r\nand developing countries, and facilitating access to\r\nknowledge and education at all levels of society so as\r\nto enable all individuals and local communities to fulfil\r\ntheir potential and their aspirations and to build their\r\ncapacity in order to strengthen well-informed decision-\r\nmaking. This is people-oriented technology for\r\neveryone.\r\nThe majority of the world’s population still lives\r\nin poverty. Millions of our fellow human beings still do\r\nnot enjoy the benefits of information and\r\ncommunication technologies. The tremendous potential\r\nof such technologies largely eludes developing\r\ncountries. Our countries must free themselves from\r\ntechnological dependence in order to find ways to\r\nacquire such technologies for our benefit and\r\nknowledge. Freeing ourselves from that dependence\r\nshould also enable us to produce goods and services for\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nthe benefit of our peoples, and make it possible to\r\napply appropriate technological solutions to our\r\nindividual problems. We are in a position to do this, if\r\nwe so chose.\r\nOvercoming the disparity between developing\r\nand developed countries in order to produce scientific\r\nand technical knowledge for the benefit of social,\r\neconomic and political development is one of the main\r\nproblems facing the international community. That\r\nenormous digital divide, which is growing daily, must\r\nbe bridged so as to direct knowledge to better the\r\npeoples and the economies of the majority of\r\ndeveloping countries. We therefore need urgent action\r\nand concrete solutions that involve not only the\r\nGovernments we represent here in the General\r\nAssembly but also multilateral institutions, donors, the\r\nprivate sector, the scientific community and civil\r\nsociety. In other words, we must involve every\r\ncomponent of society in this great endeavour for the\r\nfuture of our peoples.\r\nInformation and communication technologies\r\nmust be considered in the broad context of the\r\npriorities and structures of developing countries.\r\nWithout a common and appropriate vision and timely\r\ninternational cooperation to gradually reduce the digital\r\ndivide that has so often been referred to in the\r\nAssembly, the ICT revolution will continue\r\nincreasingly to marginalize the peoples of the world,\r\nand the economies of the majority of developing\r\ncountries will increasingly become more dependent and\r\nless able to overcome the challenges of an unequal\r\nworld.\r\nFor the Group of 77 and China it is essential that\r\nwe attain concrete results from the various\r\ninternational initiatives adopted to strengthen capacity\r\nand to allow developing countries to benefit from the\r\nopportunities provided by information and\r\ncommunication technologies. That means we must act,\r\nand not just adopt rhetorical declarations. Initiatives\r\nshould provide appropriate conditions to create\r\ninternational action leading to development. This is not\r\na matter of science and technology for their own sake.\r\nInstead, development must be the objective of this\r\ndebate, as was recognized in the ministerial declaration\r\nof the 2000 high-level segment of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council and in that Council’s 2001 coordination\r\nsegment. That was also mandated by the General\r\nAssembly at its meeting held on 17 and 18 June 2002\r\nto consider information and communication\r\ntechnologies.\r\nThe creation of the United Nations Information\r\nand Communication Technologies Task Force\r\nrepresents a recognition of the existence of the digital\r\ndivide between developed and developing countries.\r\nAccordingly, the work done by the Task Force to make\r\nprogress in this process is an effective and proper\r\ncontribution towards the future of this effort. I would\r\nlike to stress the fact that this subject has had an\r\nimportant influence on the work of the Committee on\r\nInformation — and I mention this because my country\r\nhas the honour to chair that important Committee. Yet\r\nthe search for a strategy to effectively disseminate\r\ninformation on the work of the Organization, and the\r\ndebates that have taken place in the Department of\r\nPublic Information, make it possible to properly\r\ninclude the element of coordinated action as we chart a\r\nnew path for the United Nations. They have also made\r\nit possible to call for an ICT revolution in the very\r\nheart of the Organization itself, so as to enable us to\r\nadapt to the huge transformation that our peoples and\r\nleaders are calling for.\r\nWe look forward to the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society, which will be held at Geneva in\r\nDecember 2003 and at Tunis in 2005. The Group of\r\n77’s Dubai Conference recognized the enormous\r\npossibilities that these meetings and the Summit will\r\nopen for the developing world: in cooperation with\r\ndeveloped countries, they will be able to continue to\r\ndevelop the basis for a strategy for South-South\r\ncooperation — yet one that is geared towards South-\r\nSouth-North cooperation.\r\nThe United Nations and other international\r\norganizations have reiterated the importance of\r\ninformation and communication technologies as\r\npowerful tools to facilitate the integration of the\r\ncountries that make up the United Nations. The time\r\nhas come for us to meet our commitments in this regard\r\nand move ahead with the great revolution in\r\ninformation and communication technologies on behalf\r\nof the poorest in the world and for the benefit of all\r\nmankind.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): It is always\r\na great honour — and an intimidating enterprise — to\r\ntake the floor after the representative of Venezuela,\r\nwho has just stated the position of the Group of 77 and\r\nChina. I would like to congratulate him on the vivid\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nstatement he has just made, as well as to say that my\r\ndelegation fully associates itself with the position he\r\nhas just set out.\r\nAllow me, on behalf of the delegation of Senegal,\r\nto express our sincere thanks to the President for his\r\nexcellent initiative to include in our agenda the very\r\ntopical subject of information and communication\r\ntechnologies (ICTs) for development. Just a few\r\nmonths ago, on 17 and 18 June, in accordance with\r\nresolution 56/258, the General Assembly convened a\r\nmemorable meeting on information and communication\r\ntechnologies for development. Also under\r\nconsideration were reducing the digital divide and\r\ntaking advantage of the possibilities offered by the\r\ndigital revolution in the new information society.\r\nPresident Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal was the main\r\nspeaker at that meeting, as the coordinator of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nprogramme in the strategic sector of new information\r\nand communication technologies.\r\nThe major socio-economic disparities that\r\nregulate access to information are particularly\r\nalarming. The perverse overlapping of current trends\r\nleads us to fear that the digital divide will increase\r\neven more, particularly between the elite of the\r\nprivileged users of the information highways and the\r\nrank and file of digital illiterates who are relegated to\r\nthe very back of the virtual revolution. Unfortunately,\r\nsome data collected by the International\r\nTelecommunications Union make for enlightening\r\nreading. There are 83 countries with only 10 telephone\r\nlines per one hundred people, and 25 countries with\r\nfewer than one per hundred. Sixty-one Member States\r\nhave less than one Internet navigator for every one\r\nhundred people. Then there is the cost of Internet\r\naccess, which is five cents a minute in Switzerland, for\r\nexample, compared to $1 in Africa, which is 20 times\r\nmore expensive than in Europe.\r\nThat is why African leaders, seeking urgently to\r\nfind sustainable solutions to the continent’s\r\nunderdevelopment, have made the information and\r\ntechnology sector a priority of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD). They believe strongly\r\nthat by facilitating Africa’s integration into the new\r\ninformation society, our continent will be better able to\r\nmanage development, trade, investment and finance,\r\nwhile at the same time working more effectively to\r\neradicate poverty. That, of course, involves a titanic\r\nstruggle to overcome ignorance and illiteracy.\r\nThe right path to meet that challenge can be\r\nsummed up in a single word: education. African heads\r\nof State are well aware of that. They realize that the\r\ndevelopment of human resources and the flourishing of\r\ncreative capacities are certainly a determining factor in\r\neconomic growth because of the multiplier effects on\r\nthe production processes.\r\nWe also need to ensure the proper implementation\r\nof carrier strategies and policies, with a view to\r\npromoting better education that can produce competent\r\nofficials who can take advantage of all the\r\nopportunities of the digital universe. In that context,\r\nthe support of the United Nations is essential,\r\nparticularly with regard to implementing the decisions\r\nand recommendations set out in the Plan of Action for\r\nEducation adopted at the Dakar Conference. In order to\r\ndo that, we need to act together to break the vicious\r\ncircle of conflicts and endemic poverty, support the\r\npromotion of digital opportunities in Africa and in the\r\nleast developed countries, help Africa evaluate its\r\npriority needs and implement effective strategies so\r\nthat we can better profit from the introduction of new\r\ninformation and communications technologies in\r\ndevelopment objectives.\r\nThe Government of Senegal early recognized the\r\nimmense stakes of the digital world and the\r\nextraordinary progress made in ICT. It has promoted\r\nthe establishment of cybercafes in many cities and the\r\nproliferation of communication centres in the country’s\r\nmost remote areas. It has also embarked successfully\r\non laying high-capacity underwater fibre-optic links\r\nthat now connect Senegal to a number of African\r\ncountries and to Europe and Asia as well. It is that\r\nsame concern for “digital opening up” that recently led\r\nthe Senegalese State to launch an ambitious technology\r\npark project, or “cybervillage”, on the outskirts of the\r\ncapital, Dakar, with highly competitive\r\ntelecommunication infrastructures for businesses and\r\nyoung people in the continent who wish to participate\r\nin the new economy.\r\nAs part of that process, my country, with the\r\nvaluable support of Microsoft, has established a\r\nprogramme for very young children that is designed to\r\nprovide early training in computer use to children\r\nbetween the ages of 2 and 6, whose specific needs will\r\nbe accommodated in the framework of the ministry\r\nestablished by the Government just two days ago. In\r\nthe same vein, the University of the African Future,\r\nwhich is to be set up in Senegal, will, in real time and\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nby satellite, provide teaching targeted at a large number\r\nof African students.\r\nIt is through such initiatives, which must be\r\nintensified, and thanks to better mastery of ICT, that\r\nthe African peoples will be able to retake the place that\r\nhas always belonged to them in the alliance of\r\ncontinents. That is why the essential support of the\r\nUnited Nations and our development partners is\r\nexpected, in keeping with the wish expressed at the\r\nconference held in Dakar in April 2002 on partnership\r\nwith the private sector for the financing of NEPAD.\r\nMembers will recall that at the end of the Dakar\r\nConference, organized in the wake of the Monterrey\r\nConference, Africa sought massive support from the\r\ninternational community to carry out a number of\r\nprojects, some of the most important being the\r\nfollowing: the establishment of Intranet networks at the\r\nsubregional and pan-African levels to circulate audio-\r\nvisual information, long-distance education and the\r\ndevelopment of human resources, harmonization of the\r\nregulatory framework for African telecommunications\r\nto facilitate foreign investment, development of\r\ninfrastructures and improvement of connectivity,\r\npromotion of cultural industries, assembling industrial\r\nunits to produce computer and telecommunications\r\nequipment, and establishment of a world fund for ICT\r\nto help Africa reduce its digital deficiency.\r\nIn preparing for the World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society, to be held in Geneva from 10 to\r\n12 December 2003 and in Tunis in 2005, it would be\r\nuseful to have a meeting, perhaps next year in Dakar,\r\nbetween, on the one hand, President Abdoulaye Wade,\r\ncoordinator of the NEPAD ICT programme, and, on the\r\nother hand, the Secretary-General of the International\r\nTelecommunications Union, the Special Adviser to the\r\nSecretary-General on Africa and NEPAD, the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for\r\nInformation and Communication Technologies, the\r\nChairman of the United Nations Information and\r\nCommunication Technologies Task Force, the\r\nChairman of the Digital Opportunities Task Force, the\r\nChairman of the Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group\r\non Informatics, the High Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General for the Least Developed Countries,\r\nand all development partners and international or pan-\r\nAfrican authorities in that vital sector.\r\nThe Senegalese head of State continues to\r\nemphasize that ICT assumes a superior democracy in\r\nwhich everyone advances at the same rate, within the\r\ncontext of globalization and of the development\r\nprocess. Therefore, it is through a coherent, holistic\r\nand voluntary approach that the United Nations will be\r\nable to address the enormous cybernetic challenge so\r\nthat everyone — men and women, rich and poor — can\r\ntake an active part in this fascinating digital adventure\r\nthat is already showing us a glimmer of the humanist\r\ncivilization of the virtual at the dawn of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nMr. Margarian (Armenia): The extremely fast-\r\npaced developments in technology have led us to focus\r\nattention on its immense possibilities and to predict the\r\narrival of what has variously been termed “the global\r\nvillage”, “the information economy”, “the knowledge\r\neconomy” and “the information society”.\r\nAs we move into the third millennium, it is of the\r\nutmost importance to understand and to influence the\r\nfundamental changes brought about by the\r\ncommunication and information revolution. In the\r\ncontemporary world, productivity and competitiveness\r\nare characterized as being based on the generation of\r\nnew knowledge, know-how and access to and\r\nprocessing of information. Information technologies,\r\ntelecommunications and many other fields of\r\ntechnological innovation offer new opportunities to\r\ndeveloping countries and countries with economies in\r\ntransition to target development projects. It is crucial to\r\nreplace bureaucratic systems of organization and\r\nmanagement with new organizational forms. The\r\nlandlocked countries are in particular need to exploit\r\nthe expanded opportunities of information and\r\ncommunication technologies (ICTs) in this regard.\r\nWe all agree that there is a special need to address\r\nthe digital divide and to put information and\r\ncommunication technologies at the service of\r\ndevelopment, which requires particular attention from\r\nthe United Nations. In this respect, we welcome the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations ICT Task Force,\r\nwhich reflects the readiness of the United Nations to\r\ncommit to these problems.\r\nWe expect the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety (WSIS), to be held in Geneva in 2003 and in\r\nTunis in 2005, to find ways and means of bridging the\r\ndigital divide and to make the vast opportunities\r\noffered by information technologies available to all.\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nWe believe that international agreements and\r\ndeclarations relating to information technologies\r\ndevelopment must be complemented by practical work\r\nto bridge and prevent the digital divide with a sustained\r\ncommitment to technical assistance and capacity-\r\nbuilding to the countries that have committed\r\nthemselves to competition and market-based\r\neconomies.\r\nIn December 2000, the Government of Armenia\r\ndeclared the development of information technologies,\r\na sector in which Armenia has developed considerable\r\nknow-how and expertise, to be a main priority for\r\nfostering the economy, creating jobs and raising\r\neducation standards.\r\nThe Armenian Government has now launched an\r\ninnovative e-governance project. The flagship of the\r\nprogramme is an e-visa system, which was introduced\r\nthis October with financial assistance from the Office\r\nof the United Nations Development Programme in\r\nYerevan. Anyone around the world with access to the\r\nInternet may apply for an entry visa online. Thus,\r\nArmenia appears to be among the first countries in the\r\nworld to offer electronic visas. This is the starting point\r\nof the programme, which will put other consular\r\nservices online as well. A draft law on e-documents\r\nand e-signatures has been worked out to promote\r\ne-commerce in Armenia.\r\nWeb-based commerce has the potential to\r\nimprove productivity both in national and the global\r\neconomies, making existing industries more efficient\r\nwhile creating new industries that we have not yet\r\nimagined. A number of techno-parks and powerful\r\nbusiness incubators, established with the assistance of\r\nthe World Bank and of Armenian communities abroad,\r\nare currently successfully operating in Armenia.\r\nNew legal frameworks and standards are being\r\nset up to promote the development and interconnection\r\nof national information infrastructures. The\r\nGovernment is working on the parallel regulatory\r\nchanges necessary to facilitate and foster further\r\ninformation technology development in the country.\r\nOne of our strategic programmes is the preparation of\r\nspecialists of the new generation. In this regard, the\r\nInformation Technologies Institute, recently established\r\nunder the auspices of the European Union-initiated\r\ntechnical assistance to the Commonwealth of\r\nIndependent States and Georgia programme, is of great\r\nimportance for the preparation of highly qualified\r\nspecialists not only for Armenia, but for the countries\r\nof the region as well.\r\nICTs have become a major consolidating factor in\r\npromoting the processes of regional cooperation.\r\nArmenia is pleased that there is political will in many\r\ndeveloped countries to support and encourage these\r\nprocesses. We highly appreciate the various European\r\nUnion initiatives in the field of information technology\r\ndevelopment in the South Caucasus region. The\r\nEuropean Union’s Caucasus Information Technology\r\nInitiative has been launched recently. This initiative\r\naims at supporting the South Caucasus’ integration into\r\nthe global information community.\r\nThe complexity and interconnectedness of today’s\r\nworld problems defy traditional explanations and\r\nsolutions and require a completely new approach. We\r\nbelieve that the imaginative use of emerging\r\ntechnologies and the creation of cooperative\r\napproaches are able to accelerate development and\r\nreverse the most worrisome trends in various regions.\r\nThe spread of information and communication\r\ntechnologies may become, among other things, the\r\nconsolidating factor for confidence-building,\r\npromoting stability and security in many regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nMrs. Bose (India): The agenda item “Information\r\nand communication technologies for development” is\r\nof great importance to developing countries, as they are\r\nkeen to benefit from information and communication\r\ntechnologies (ICTs) in their struggle to eradicate\r\npoverty and to achieve sustained economic growth.\r\nICTs, the new paradigm of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, have the potential to create new approaches to\r\ndevelopment, particularly through the possibility of\r\nleapfrogging stages of technological development. At\r\nthe Millennium Summit, our heads of Government and\r\nState recognized the tremendous opportunities offered\r\nby ICTs and agreed to work together to ensure that the\r\nbenefits of new technologies, especially ICTs, are\r\navailable to all.\r\nBridging the digital divide — the uneven\r\ndiffusion of ICTs — between and within nations is now\r\na global objective. Given the pace of the revolutionary\r\nchanges in the field of ICTs, the divide widens every\r\nday, demonstrating the imperative of concerted action\r\nby the international community as a matter of the\r\nutmost urgency. At the same time, it is important to\r\nreach a consensus, which unfortunately we have not yet\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nreached, on how to adequately harness the potential of\r\nICTs to assist developing countries in their efforts to\r\nsecure a better standard of living for their people.\r\nThe United Nations has a crucial role to play in\r\nmaking ICTs work for the promotion of the\r\ndevelopment efforts of developing countries. The\r\nholding of the special meeting of the General Assembly\r\nthis June was significant in promoting awareness. The\r\nUnited Nations system now needs to work on concrete\r\nprogrammes that provide technical and financial\r\nsupport for capacity-building to developing countries.\r\nThe ICT Task Force, we are confident, will contribute\r\nto this process.\r\nThe World Summit on the Information Society, to\r\nbe held in two phases — in 2003 in Switzerland and in\r\n2005 in Tunisia — should focus on how to achieve the\r\nobjective of ICTs for all. We hope that the meeting will\r\nbuild a consensus at the global level on how to increase\r\naccess to ICTs, use ICTs for development and secure a\r\ncommitment at the political level to act in concert on\r\nthe basis of mutual benefit. We believe that the\r\ninvolvement of major groups and relevant stakeholders\r\nwill contribute greatly to our efforts to achieve the goal\r\nof ICT for all.\r\nWe in India have embarked on attaining the target\r\nof information technology for all at the national level\r\nby 2008, so that the benefits of this technology reach\r\nthe common man even in the most remote parts of the\r\ncountry. In its strategy towards that end, India will\r\nfocus on developing the necessary information\r\ntechnology infrastructure and enhancing human\r\ncapacities. We expect, in the next five years, to have\r\n200 to 300 million telephone users and 300 to 400\r\nmillion Internet users. This will require large\r\ninvestments in the areas of, inter-alia, optical fiber\r\ncables, Internet service providers, Internet data centres\r\nand mobile telephony. We have undertaken initiatives\r\ntowards that end, and we are working with stakeholders\r\nand the private sector to make access to information\r\ntechnology affordable and user friendly.\r\nSome specific measures being pursued in India\r\ninclude a mass campaign for information technology\r\nawareness, the establishment of information technology\r\nkiosks, the promotion of information technology\r\neducation in all schools and colleges, the establishment\r\nof national- and State-level digital libraries and the\r\npromotion of information technology for agriculture\r\nand integrated rural development, including through\r\nwired villages. We are also committed to e-governance,\r\nwhich brings people and Government even closer to\r\neach other. The first step we took was the posting by all\r\nGovernment departments of information on their\r\nactivities on the World Wide Web. The second was to\r\nmove to a stage of interaction where inputs are sought\r\nfrom our people on Government programmes and\r\ninitiatives, with a view to their further improvement.\r\nThe third stage, which is now under implementation, is\r\nto allow for transactions between the Government and\r\nthe people to be made electronically.\r\nWe also believe that e-commerce is another area\r\nthat has tremendous scope. Information technology has\r\nbroken geographical barriers, which opens up\r\nopportunities for small- and medium-scale enterprises\r\nto extend their geographical reach and secure new\r\ncustomers in ways formerly restricted to much larger\r\nfirms. We will, however, have to address the challenges\r\nof providing a sound legal basis to those transactions.\r\nWe must also address issues of security.\r\nThe information technology industry is income-\r\ngenerating and can contribute to the economic growth\r\nof a country. The gross annual revenue of the\r\ninformation technology software and services industry\r\nin India during the fiscal year 2000-2001 was over $8.2\r\nbillion. Exports contributed $6.2 billion to that figure,\r\nan increase of 55 per cent in dollar terms over the\r\nprevious year. The Indian software industry currently\r\naccounts for 2 per cent of our gross domestic product.\r\nThat figure is projected to increase to 7.7 per cent by\r\n2008. Its contribution to exports is presently 14 per\r\ncent, and is projected to increase to 35 per cent by\r\n2008. The performance of Indian industry derives from\r\nits quality and its delivery of high-end requirements. A\r\nsurvey of giant transnational corporations reveals that\r\none out of every four outsources its critical software\r\nrequirements from India. India also has the\r\npredominant share of companies to have received the\r\nSoftware Engineering Institute’s capability maturity\r\nmodel level 5 certification of industry recognition for\r\nthe highest standards of quality in software\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe subscribe to the view that it is necessary to\r\ndevelop human resources through education, including\r\nsecondary and tertiary education, in order to benefit\r\nfrom ICT. The social benefits of primary education are\r\nwidely acknowledged, and it is therefore a worldwide\r\ngoal. In today’s technological world, secondary and\r\ntertiary education have become equally important.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nSimilarly, the role of vocational training centres or\r\ninformation technology institutions that provide the\r\nspecific skills demanded by the market is pivotal. It is\r\nthe development of such skills and capabilities that\r\nattracts private investment, including foreign direct\r\ninvestment, and, in turn, contributes to economic\r\ngrowth and poverty reduction. The growth of the\r\ninformation technology industry in India is due, to a\r\nlarge extent, to the availability of a large pool of skilled\r\nmanpower. Our information technology training\r\nindustry has gross annual revenues of $400 million,\r\nand an annual growth rate of about 40 per cent. We\r\ntherefore again strongly commend efforts by the United\r\nNations system, particularly its funds and programmes,\r\nin providing technical assistance and capacity-building.\r\nWe recognize the important role that can be\r\nplayed by ICT in promoting development. Our own\r\nexperience attests to this. We, however, also subscribe\r\nto the view that ICT alone cannot solve the problems of\r\npoverty and under-development. It is also our view that\r\na judicious blend of emphasis on provision of basic\r\nsocial, educational and health services, as well as on\r\nthe development of both brick and click industries, is\r\nrequired in any strategy for sustained human\r\ndevelopment and poverty reduction.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 32. The Assembly\r\nhas thus concluded its consideration of agenda 32.\r\nAgenda item 42\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession: implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/227 and\r\nCorr.1)\r\nThe Acting President: In connection with this\r\nitem, the President of the General Assembly has asked\r\nme to announce that he has appointed Mr. Enrique\r\nManalo, Deputy Permanent Representative of the\r\nPhilippines to the United Nations, as facilitator to\r\nnegotiate a draft resolution on this item.\r\nMs. Reds (Norway): HIV/AIDS is the worst\r\npandemic in human history. HIV/AIDS is frustrating\r\ndevelopment efforts. It is undermining educational\r\nprogrammes, health systems, public administration and\r\nagriculture — the entire fabric of society. It is\r\nreversing decades of development gains. An\r\nextraordinary effort will be needed by all development\r\npartners to achieve the goal of halting and reversing\r\nHIV/AIDS and other major diseases. And a great deal\r\nof work must be done before 2015 if we are to fulfil the\r\npromises made in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nBusiness as usual is not an option. With the adoption\r\nby the General Assembly last year of the United\r\nNations Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (S-\r\n26/2, annex), the world community demonstrated its\r\nreadiness to march. The Declaration sets out a number\r\nof concrete and time-bound goals. We know where we\r\nare going, and what tools to use to combat the\r\nepidemic. Now we must translate our political\r\ncommitment into action.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment has been an\r\nimportant framework and instrument for creating\r\nawareness about the epidemic. The report of the\r\nSecretary-General on progress towards the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration (A/57/227) points\r\nout the achievements that have been gained and the\r\nchallenges that remain.\r\nThere is cause for optimism, especially in the\r\nfields of leadership, partnership and resource\r\nmobilization. More and more countries are adopting\r\nnational plans and strategies to combat HIV/AIDS.\r\nHowever, the results at the country level are not\r\nsatisfactory. There is still a long way to go before\r\nnational strategies are truly multisectoral. Many\r\ncountries report difficulties in involving a range of\r\nsectors. The HIV/AIDS response is still, to a large\r\nextent, centred in the ministries of health.\r\nWe encourage the UNAIDS secretariat and\r\nsponsors to assist countries in integrating HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes into their poverty reduction strategies and\r\nsector-wide approaches. It is also essential that all\r\nstakeholders coordinate their work to ensure that\r\nefforts to combat HIV/AIDS at the national level are\r\nintegrated into national plans and strategies.\r\nToo many of the efforts against AIDS are still\r\nbeing conducted as small-scale interventions. We need\r\nmore nationwide comprehensive programmes. Many\r\nprevention programmes have been shown to work, but\r\nthey are still confined to small geographical areas. The\r\ntime has come to apply good practices on a much larger\r\nscale.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nThe main reason why this has not been done is\r\nreported to be a lack of resources. Many countries\r\nreport that their high debt burden prevents them from\r\nallocating sufficient resources to fight HIV/AIDS. We\r\nstrongly encourage the donor community to step up its\r\nfunding to combat the pandemic. We urge all partners\r\ninvolved to ensure the effective implementation of the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative.\r\nThe resources allocated to HIV/AIDS have\r\nincreased by 50 per cent since 2001. This increase has\r\ncome from developing countries’ own budget\r\nallocations, donor nations, multilateral allocations,\r\ncivil society and private sector funds. But this is still\r\nless than one third of the resources needed to fund the\r\nglobal response to HIV/AIDS. According to UNAIDS\r\nestimates, $10.5 billion is needed annually. By 2007\r\nthis figure will have risen to $15 billion. We strongly\r\nencourage the donor community to step up its funding\r\nto combat the pandemic.\r\nOne of the instruments for raising the necessary\r\nresources is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. Although the Fund is not\r\npart of the United Nations, Norway encourages United\r\nNations agencies and the Fund to continue to cooperate\r\nclosely. The Fund should make use of existing\r\nmechanisms and expertise of the United Nations\r\nsystem. The roles of UNAIDS and the Global Fund are\r\ncomplementary and mutually reinforcing: one provides\r\nexpertise and technical assistance, whereas the other is\r\npurely a financing instrument. The United Nations\r\nfamily has vast country and programme experience,\r\nwhich will be extremely valuable to the Fund when\r\nidentifying which programmes are ready to be scaled\r\nup. We are also concerned about the need for the\r\nUnited Nations family to strengthen and better\r\ncoordinate its efforts at the country level, not least with\r\nthe relevant national authorities, especially as a result\r\nof the establishment of the Fund.\r\nEducation is the only known vaccine against\r\nHIV/AIDS — at least for the time being. Respect for\r\nthe right to information and reproductive health care is\r\nessential if we are to halt the spread of the epidemic.\r\nLack of knowledge kills thousands of people every day.\r\nIn the fight against HIV/AIDS, we must break down\r\nthe walls of silence and denial. The price of not doing\r\nso has become too high. Prevention and care\r\nprogrammes are being hampered by the discrimination\r\nand stigmatization that surround the epidemic. We must\r\nspeak up against this.\r\nThe Global Fund does not cover research and\r\ndevelopment. However, we have committed ourselves\r\nto increasing global efforts to develop and put into use\r\nnew, efficient prevention tools such as HIV-preventive\r\nvaccines and microbicides.\r\nWe have also committed ourselves to\r\nimplementing strategies for creating supportive\r\nenvironments for orphans and other children affected\r\nby HIV/AIDS. But more than half of the countries that\r\nresponded to the Secretary-General’s questionnaire\r\nlack strategies to cope with the steadily increasing\r\nnumber of children who are orphaned as a result of the\r\nepidemic. Donor countries and civil society must\r\nsupport national Governments’ efforts to cope with this\r\ngrave problem.\r\nFor a long time the international fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS was exclusively concerned with prevention.\r\nThis has now changed. Part of this change came with\r\nthe Declaration adopted at the General Assembly’s\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS in the summer of 2001.\r\nThe Declaration recognized care and treatment,\r\nincluding anti-retroviral therapy as a central tool in the\r\nglobal campaign against HIV/AIDS. There is no doubt\r\nthat access to medical treatment is a legitimate\r\ndemand. An effective HIV/AIDS response also requires\r\ngiving people who are already infected the support,\r\ncare and treatment they need.\r\nAlthough the cost of HIV/AIDS drugs has\r\ndeclined sharply during the past few years, it remains\r\ntoo high for most people in the developing countries.\r\nWe must continue our efforts to ensure that the\r\ndeveloping countries gain access to inexpensive drugs\r\nproduced under licence, and that the pharmaceutical\r\nindustry assumes its share of the responsibility. At the\r\nsame time, local health care systems must be\r\nstrengthened so that they can offer an effective chain of\r\nhealth-related services designed to meet the needs of\r\nindividuals, regardless of their HIV status or the stage\r\nof infection.\r\nThe importance of the General Assembly’s\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS should not be\r\nunderestimated. It marked a definite turning point in\r\nhow we perceive and respond to the epidemic. We have\r\nagreed on the strategies for combating the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic. The next step is to turn our good intentions\r\ninto action. We must ensure that we follow up the\r\nvarious declarations and summits in a consistent\r\nmanner. We would encourage the General Assembly to\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\ndevote a full day of next year’s session to a discussion\r\nof the implementation of the Assembly’s HIV/AIDS\r\nDeclaration of Commitment.\r\nMs. Marzec-Boguslanska (Poland): It is a great\r\nhonour for me to address this Assembly today, during\r\nthis meeting devoted to the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. As the time\r\nhas come to assess the outcome of enhanced\r\ncoordination and intensification of our efforts, I\r\nappreciate having this opportunity to describe activities\r\nbeing carried out in Poland aimed at putting our efforts\r\nand commitments into practice.\r\nCombating AIDS in Poland is carried out in\r\naccordance with its National Programme for HIV\r\nPrevention and Care for People Living with\r\nHIV/AIDS. The Minister of Health, on the advice of\r\nthe Country Coordinating Mechanism on AIDS and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, especially those\r\nparticipating in the National Programme, sets up the\r\nNational Plan and determines the overall framework of\r\nPoland’s national policy on HIV/AIDS.\r\nImplementation of the national policy is\r\naccomplished through intersectoral cooperation and\r\nimplementation of the national plan. The Minister of\r\nHealth acts through his adviser on AIDS and drug\r\naddiction, with the National AIDS Centre playing a\r\nleading role on his behalf. The National AIDS Centre,\r\nbeing an agency of the central Government,\r\ncoordinates all activities concerning HIV/AIDS control\r\nin Poland and cooperates with other countries, in\r\nparticular with the countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\nThe national plan includes the most important\r\ninstruments for HIV/AIDS prevention and therapy and\r\naims mainly at the prevention of HIV infection,\r\nformulating an appropriate stance based on\r\ncontemporary knowledge in the field, on human rights\r\nand on the provision of integrated care through the\r\nnational programme. One of the national programme’s\r\npriorities is reducing the prevalence of HIV, with a\r\nview to curbing the spread of HIV infection in Poland\r\nthrough: education of society, with particular emphasis\r\non the education of youth — since approximately 64\r\nper cent of HIV-positive people are under the age of\r\n29; carrying out prevention activities among people in\r\nthe groups at greater risk of HIV infection;\r\nencouraging people to take HIV diagnostic tests;\r\npermanently monitoring safety standards for blood and\r\nblood-replacing agents; and preventing diseases that\r\nfavour HIV transmission. Subsequent actions target\r\nparticularly vulnerable groups.\r\nThe development of a network of anonymous and\r\nconfidential testing in Poland is a crucial part of\r\nprevention activities. Model testing centres began\r\noperation in Poland in 1997, offering anonymous,\r\nconfidential and free testing, as well as pre-test and\r\npost-test counselling.\r\nIn the context of HIV/AIDS, drug abuse is\r\nbecoming an increasingly serious problem. Methadone-\r\nbased substitution therapy has started as a pilot project.\r\nAt present, there are 11 such programmes, involving\r\napproximately 800 people.\r\nIn order to prevent mother-to-child HIV\r\ntransmission, pregnant women are encouraged by\r\nfamily doctors to take an HIV test on a voluntary basis.\r\nAnti-retroviral prophylactics, since the very beginning\r\nof their use, have been offered to HIV-positive\r\npregnant women. There are a number of programmes,\r\nimplemented mainly by the Institute of Mother and\r\nChild Health in cooperation with the National AIDS\r\nCentre and non-governmental organizations.\r\nAccordingly, the rate of vertical transmission has\r\ndecreased from 23 per cent to 0.3 per cent.\r\nWith respect to HIV/AIDS prevention in the\r\nworkplace, an inventory of the existing situation is\r\nbeing carried out in cooperation with the United\r\nNations Development Programme in order to prepare\r\nguidelines concerning HIV/AIDS and human rights in\r\nthe workplace, addressed to employees, employers and\r\ncivil society institutions.\r\nSince 1990, all patients covered by the national\r\nprogramme have had access to specialized treatment.\r\nThere are 14 State reference centres for AIDS therapy\r\nin Poland. Currently, many initiatives have been\r\nimplemented in cooperation with Eastern European\r\ncountries.\r\nIt should also be noted that psychological and\r\nsocial support for HIV-positive patients and their\r\nfamilies is provided by ensuring support for\r\nhospitalized persons and by providing the opportunity\r\nto participate in group, individual, marital and family\r\ntherapy. Special attention is given to HIV-positive\r\nchildren and to those living in families with HIV/AIDS\r\nproblems.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nWith respect to the issue of HIV/AIDS and\r\nhuman rights, Polish law lacks rules and regulations on\r\nthe issue of HIV/AIDS in the context of human rights.\r\nDespite some cases of a discriminatory reaction by\r\nsociety in the early years, when HIV infections first\r\nappeared in Poland, social pressure did not result in\r\nlegislative changes. In addition to the increase in social\r\nawareness and HIV/AIDS social education, there seems\r\nto be greater tolerance and less stigmatization in the\r\nworkplace. People who are willing to work can find\r\njobs in non-governmental organizations and other\r\ninstitutions, where they can help others, as well as do\r\nsomething for themselves. HIV-infected persons may\r\ndecide whether or not to disclose their status; no one is\r\ninformed without their consent. There is no compulsory\r\ntesting for admission to schools, for employment or for\r\nany kind of immigration or visa procedures.\r\nLegislative policy is oriented towards solutions\r\npreventing any discrimination against persons living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS. Except where blood donations, organ\r\ntransplants, criminal proceedings and court warrants\r\nare concerned, Polish law does not permit HIV/AIDS\r\ndiagnostic tests without consent or against a patient’s\r\nwill. HIV/AIDS data protection strictly requires that\r\ndoctors and other hospital staff keep those cases\r\nconfidential. Relevant regulations impose the strict\r\nobligation of treating all medical and official\r\ninformation as confidential.\r\nThe national programme supports the principle of\r\nfull protection and promotion of human rights based on\r\nthe inalienable dignity of an individual.\r\nThe issue of gender is fully reflected in the\r\nnational programme. There are a number of education\r\nprogrammes carried out in schools, and they address\r\ngirls and boys equally. There are also a number of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations assisting sex workers.\r\nMoreover, there are prevention activities and\r\neducational materials that take into account different\r\nneeds according to gender and age.\r\nPoland contributes significantly to the\r\ninternational community’s efforts on the issue of\r\nhuman rights in the context of HIV and AIDS. Every\r\ntwo years since the beginning of the 1990s, Poland has\r\nintroduced in the Commission on Human Rights a draft\r\nresolution on the protection of human rights in the\r\ncontext of HIV/AIDS.\r\nRecognizing the importance of the family, youth-\r\nfriendly information, sexual education, counselling\r\nservices and cultural, religious and moral factors, our\r\nactivities focus on society as a whole, with special\r\nattention to women of childbearing age and parents of\r\nadolescent children. Educational actions are aimed at\r\nshaping responsible attitudes towards one’s health and\r\nat preventing situations that favour infection. Special\r\nattention is given to youth at schools and to the staff\r\nresponsible for their education. Training is provided to\r\nthe personnel responsible for the education of youth.\r\nIssues of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted\r\ninfections are included in the standards for training\r\nteachers in the framework of pedagogical studies,\r\nqualification tests and postgraduate studies.\r\nLet me point out in conclusion that the State\r\nleadership in my country brings together institutions\r\nand organizations at the central and local levels of\r\nadministration, together with civil society. Legislative\r\npolicy is oriented towards solutions preventing any\r\ndiscrimination against persons living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nProgrammes for the prevention of epidemics in Poland\r\nare well developed. Through the preventive measures,\r\nmedical treatment and social support provided by the\r\nnational programme, the scale of the epidemic in\r\nPoland is relatively stable. However, in spite of that\r\nrelatively stable situation, Poland recognizes that the\r\nregion of Central and Eastern Europe actually has a\r\nvery rapidly rising rate of infection, which could result\r\nin a rapid escalation of the epidemic throughout\r\nEurope.\r\nThe Polish Government will continue its efforts\r\nto ensure broader involvement in civil society for\r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS, and to promote and\r\nprotect their rights. We are open to sharing our\r\nexperience in the prevention of HIV/AIDS and of other\r\ncommunicable diseases with our partners in the region,\r\nthus promoting cross-sectoral and transnational\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Scarcely a year ago, we held an urgent\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly to confront the\r\nproblem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects and to\r\ncoordinate and intensify national, regional and\r\ninternational activities to combat the pandemic in an\r\nintegrated way. At that time, 36.1 million people were\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS, 90 per cent of them in\r\ndeveloping countries and 75 per cent of them in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. Currently, 40 million people are\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\ninfected with the virus. Of those, 3 million are children\r\nand 28.5 million live in sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nIt is true that HIV/AIDS affects all countries and\r\npeoples, rich and poor, without distinction, but it is\r\nalso true that all do not have the same opportunities to\r\nattack and prevent the disease, and therein lies the\r\ndifference. Today, millions of persons die of AIDS and\r\nother millions continue to be infected with the virus.\r\nMore than 80 per cent of those deaths occur in Africa,\r\nwhere the majority of the millions affected by the\r\nepidemic have no access to the medicines or the\r\ntherapies that are necessary to fight the disease, to\r\nprevent other opportunistic diseases and to relieve pain.\r\nDeveloping countries — particularly those in\r\nAfrica — have made a great effort and have created\r\nnational anti-AIDS programmes. However, they cannot\r\ncope with the disease with the limited resources\r\navailable to them — resources that they must use to\r\npay their external debt or to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Today, Africa spends four times as much\r\non servicing its external debt as on education and\r\nhealth combined.\r\nWorld action against AIDS requires financial\r\nresources. According to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/57/227 and Corr.1), the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria — created as a\r\nmechanism for financing additional resources — has to\r\ndate received more than $2 million in pledged\r\ncontributions and has approved subsidies for\r\nprogrammes in low- and medium-income countries\r\ntotalling $616 million for a five-year period.\r\nObviously, the world response falls far short of the goal\r\nof $10 billion in annual expenditures by 2005.\r\nInternational cooperation is imperative. Only if\r\ndeveloping countries receive special treatment, if they\r\nare guaranteed market access, if the deterioration in the\r\nprices of basic commodities ends, if their external debt\r\nis forgiven, if they are guaranteed access to technology,\r\nif official development assistance increases and if the\r\nnecessary financial resources are allocated without\r\ninterference and conditions — only in this way will the\r\nnecessary resources to fight this disease be released.\r\nMy country, despite the fact that it is poor and has\r\nbeen subjected to an iron-fisted blockade for more than\r\nfour decades, is developing an anti-AIDS programme\r\nthat ensures integrated health care for both carriers and\r\nthe sick — free anti-retroviral therapy for all who are\r\nill and centres of specialized care for the cases that\r\nrequire it — and is fighting tirelessly for broader social\r\nintegration of the sick and of carriers, with full rights\r\nand without discrimination. Also guaranteed is access\r\nto 100 per cent certified blood donations for AIDS,\r\nhepatitis and other illnesses. Voluntary tests of all those\r\nwho are pregnant have resulted in a zero mother-to-\r\nchild transmission rate since 1997, and we are\r\nimplementing a prevention and education strategy\r\ndirected at vulnerable groups, at young people and at\r\nthe entire population. We have the lowest prevalence\r\nrate in the Americas and one of the lowest in the world,\r\nat 0.03 per cent of those between 15 and 49 years of\r\nage.\r\nDespite the fact that Cuba has no access to 50 per\r\ncent of the new medicines produced in the world\r\nbecause they are formulated by pharmaceutical\r\ncompanies and produced by medical equipment\r\nmanufacturers in the United States and by their\r\nsubsidiaries in third countries, we have contained the\r\nepidemic and have achieved a life expectancy of more\r\nthan 76 years and an infant mortality rate of 6.2.\r\nCuba wishes to share its modest experience. I\r\nshould like to reiterate my Government’s offer to help\r\nthe brotherly African peoples in the fight against the\r\nHIV pandemic by sending 4,000 doctors and health\r\ncare personnel to create the necessary infrastructure in\r\norder to provide the population with essential\r\nmedicines, prescriptions and follow-up. Those\r\npersonnel could train a great number of specialists,\r\nnurses and medical technicians. Cuba also offers to\r\nprovide the necessary teachers to create 20 medical\r\nschools, many of whom could be chosen from among\r\nthe 2,359 Cuban doctors who today are providing their\r\nservices in 17 African countries as part of an integrated\r\nhealth programme. In such schools, thousands of\r\ndoctors could be trained each year in the countries that\r\nneed them most.\r\nI wish to reiterate our offer of doctors, teachers,\r\npsychologists and other specialists who will be\r\nrequired to advise and coordinate prevention\r\ncampaigns against AIDS and other illnesses. We can\r\nsupply free medical equipment and diagnostic kits\r\nneeded for basic prevention programmes in 17\r\ncountries. We are offering free anti-retroviral therapy\r\nfor 30,000 patients. All we need is for the\r\nindustrialized countries to provide the minimum\r\nresources to make all of that possible.\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nMr. Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The holding\r\nof the twenty-sixth special session of the General\r\nAssembly, in June 2001, marked the high point of the\r\nOrganization’s concern over the problem of HIV/AIDS,\r\nwhose toll on humanity over two decades is matched\r\nonly by that of the Second World War. At the time,\r\nhopes were high that collective international effort was\r\nthe only available way to help the countries most\r\naffected by this disease to confront it, within the\r\nframework of an integrated international plan that\r\nwould take all the aspects of the disease into account,\r\nfrom prevention, care and treatment to other economic\r\nand social factors and results. Such were our hopes a\r\nyear and a half ago. Today we meet to consider what\r\nthe Secretary-General tells us in his report about the\r\nextent to which those hopes have been met.\r\nThe report shows that the international\r\ncommunity remains unable to deal with the disease:\r\neffective prevention programmes cover only 20 per\r\ncent of those affected, and of the 34 million people\r\ninfected with the virus, 86 per cent are in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica and in South-East Asia. Of that group only\r\n60,000 are receiving the anti-retroviral therapy that can\r\nstop or delay the progress of the disease.\r\nThe gravest of the statistics is that of 40 million\r\naffected by HIV/AIDS less than 10 per cent receive\r\ntreatment for this disease, which causes the body to\r\ncollapse for lack of immunity. The report shows clearly\r\nthat internationally the expenditure on combating AIDS\r\nis decreasing. It shows that despite the increase to $2.8\r\nbillion of expenditure in the low- and medium-income\r\ncountries on AIDS programmes in 2002, international\r\nresources pledged to the Global Fund to Combat AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria since its establishment have\r\namounted to some $2 billion. The total is one third of\r\nthe amount required every year. The report says that\r\nthe Fund has provided some $616 million for national\r\nprogrammes over the next five years. Analysis of the\r\ndata shows that the Fund’s Board has given only 32 per\r\ncent of the amounts required to finance national\r\nprogrammes, and that countries are not receiving the\r\nnecessary financing immediately but over five years,\r\nwhereas $400 million is needed over a period of two\r\nyears. We have several questions regarding this\r\nanalysis.\r\nIs the slow pace of the Fund’s work sufficient to\r\ncope with the tremendous speed of the spread of the\r\ndisease? Have resources increased or decreased in\r\ncomparison with those directed to the secondary\r\nchannels that existed before the Fund was established?\r\nThat is to say, has the establishment of the Fund\r\nincreased international spending on the disease or is the\r\nFund simply a forum to give specific direction to\r\nnational programmes for combating the disease?\r\nFinally, where is the United Nations role in combating\r\nAIDS?\r\nThe Egyptian delegation believes that greater\r\nemphasis should be placed on the role of the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. The\r\nProgramme’s position as an observer is not in line with\r\nthat of other funds with longer experience and a track\r\nrecord in the field. The Egyptian delegation strongly\r\nsupports the conclusion of the Secretary-General that\r\nthe issue of HIV/AIDS should be integrated into\r\nprogrammes to combat poverty and promote\r\nsustainable development, and the call to substantially\r\nincrease assistance to countries in need. The\r\npersistence of this humanitarian and social situation\r\nand the real suffering of the tens of millions who are\r\ninfected with AIDS represent challenges to the human\r\nconscience. Mankind remains unable to mobilize the\r\nresources to combat the disease. The existence of the\r\ndisease without a cure is saddening, but the fact that\r\nmost people cannot afford the medicines that exist is a\r\nsource of shame to humanity and is psychologically\r\ndestructive. We cannot call on one hand for globalizing\r\nthe economy and on the other for privatizing poverty\r\nand disease.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to put on record its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the report\r\n(A/57/227) submitted under this agenda item and for\r\nthe recommendations it contains.\r\nOver the past two decades, the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS has been spreading unchecked around the\r\nworld, resulting in more than 40 million infections and\r\nmore than 21 million deaths. It is projected that an\r\nadditional 45 million people will be infected between\r\n2002 and 2010. HIV/AIDS poses a great challenge to\r\nsocial development, economic growth and political\r\nstability worldwide and, indeed to the safety and\r\nsurvival of humankind.\r\nAs a global crisis, HIV/AIDS requires a\r\nconcerted response through global action. Addressing\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic was high on the agenda of a\r\nwhole series of major conferences, including the\r\nMillennium Summit, the World Summit for Social\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nDevelopment and the Second United Nations\r\nConference on Human Settlements (Habitat II).\r\nAt its twenty-sixth special session, on HIV/AIDS,\r\nheld last year, the General Assembly adopted the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (resolution\r\nS26/2), setting out the goals, tasks and responsibilities\r\nin the international fight against the epidemic. The\r\nDeclaration has become an important document\r\nguiding our struggle against HIV/AIDS.\r\nMany countries have developed national\r\nprevention strategies in line with the Declaration.\r\nInternational organizations, governmental bodies and\r\ncivil society have adopted a series of positive measures\r\nin the fields of legislation, mobilization of resources,\r\nextensive provision of drugs for prevention and\r\ntreatment, and increase of public awareness.\r\nWhat merits particular mention is that the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which\r\nwas established only at the beginning of the year, has\r\nattracted over $2 billion in pledges and has approved\r\nthe disbursement of $616 million in funds to low- and\r\nmiddle-income countries over the next 5 years.\r\nNonetheless, that figure is still a far cry from the target\r\nof $10 billion per year by 2005.\r\nWe still have a long way to go in combating\r\nHIV/AIDS. As the Secretary-General points out in his\r\nreport, due to ineffective implementation, inadequate\r\nfunding and a shortage of medical supplies, progress in\r\nstemming the epidemic lags far behind its unrelenting\r\nadvance and destructive trend. In that connection I\r\nwish to make a few observations on international\r\ncooperation on HIV/AIDS.\r\nFirst, prevention and treatment should go hand in\r\nhand in an effective struggle against HIV/AIDS. While\r\nprevention is fundamental, treatment is the key. We\r\nshould therefore take a two-pronged approach by\r\nmaking a concerted effort to reach the targets and\r\nimplement the tasks set forth in the Declaration for\r\n2003 and 2005. These include formulating national\r\nstrategies for combating HIV/AIDS, incorporating\r\nthem into national development plans and poverty\r\neradication programmes, setting out clear goals and\r\ntaking measures for prevention and treatment, raising\r\npublic awareness, strengthening health care systems\r\nand ensuring that monitoring and enforcement take\r\nplace.\r\nSecondly, we must mobilize financial resources\r\nand provide access to drugs in fighting HIV/AIDS. In\r\nhis report, the Secretary-General points out that\r\nfunding for international cooperation in the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS should grow by at least 50 per cent\r\nannually in order to meet the annual requirement of\r\n$10 billion by 2005, and that only a small fraction of\r\nthe world’s 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS\r\nhave access to treatment due to patent-related problems\r\nand the high cost of related drugs.\r\nIt is our hope that the United Nations and its\r\nrelevant specialized agencies, funds and development\r\nprogrammes, UNAIDS in particular, will play an active\r\nand leading role in enhancing cooperation between\r\nGovernments and the private sector, exploring both\r\ntraditional and innovative means of mobilizing\r\nfinancial resources and making HIV-related drugs\r\nwidely available, so that poor populations in\r\ndeveloping countries who are afflicted with HIV/AIDS\r\nare given access to these drugs. This will help\r\neffectively to resolve one of the major problems in our\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS and benefit people living with\r\nthe epidemic.\r\nThirdly, research and development should be\r\npromoted in order to bring HIV/AIDS under control. It\r\nis essential to develop HIV-related vaccines as a means\r\nof eventually bringing HIV/AIDS under control. We\r\nhope that this issue will receive adequate attention as\r\npart and parcel of the global strategy in that respect. To\r\nthis end, it is imperative to increase investment in, and\r\nspeed up the development of, HIV-related vaccines;\r\nbuild up the research and development capability of all\r\ncountries, particularly those of developing countries\r\nand those with high infection rates; carry out\r\ninternational cooperation; increase the transfer of\r\nrelevant technologies; and establish mechanisms for\r\nregular exchange.\r\nThe fight against HIV/AIDS has received great\r\nattention from the Chinese Government, which\r\nformulated and started implementing an AIDS strategy\r\nin 1998. Our budget for combating HIV/AIDS\r\nregistered a five- to seven-fold increase in 2001. We\r\nhave also invested 1.2 billion yuan renminbi to\r\nimprove our blood-collection and supply facilities. In\r\naddition, following the special session of the General\r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS last year, China convened its\r\nfirst national conference on that subject and co-\r\nsponsored a regional seminar for Asia and the Pacific\r\nunder the Global Fund. In this endeavour, UNAIDS\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nprovided China with great support, for which we wish\r\nto record our gratitude.\r\nAs a country with a huge population, China faces\r\nspecial difficulties in preventing and controlling\r\nHIV/AIDS. We are prepared to continue our\r\ncooperation with the countries and international\r\nagencies concerned in such areas as financing;\r\ndeveloping prevention and treatment projects; lowering\r\ndrug prices; and further leveraging the advantage of\r\ntraditional Chinese medicine in treatment in a bid to\r\ncontribute to the fight against the epidemic in China\r\nand around the globe.\r\nMr. Abdul Ghafor (Brunei Darussalam): I have\r\nthe honour of speaking on behalf of the members of the\r\nAssociation of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN),\r\nnamely Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the\r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia,\r\nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and\r\nViet Nam.\r\nRealizing the serious socio-economic\r\nconsequences that the HIV/AIDS pandemic could have\r\nfor every member of this Assembly, we succeeded in\r\nadopting a Declaration of Commitment during the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS\r\nheld in June last year. Our leaders pledged to enhance\r\nthe coordination and intensification of national,\r\nregional and international efforts to combat HIV/AIDS\r\nin a comprehensive manner. We are pleased to note that\r\nthese commitments have been translated into many\r\nencouraging developments in our continuing efforts to\r\nfight HIV/AIDS.\r\nAt the regional level, ASEAN’s efforts started\r\nabout a decade ago, when our ASEAN leaders met\r\nduring the fourth ASEAN Summit in Singapore in\r\n1992. HIV/AIDS was considered a threat of regional\r\nconcern, and our ASEAN leaders agreed to make a\r\ncoordinated effort to curb its spread. An ASEAN Task\r\nForce on AIDS was established in 1993 to strengthen\r\nregional coordination, build regional capacity and\r\naddress cross- border issues. With the assistance of the\r\nWorld Health Organization, ASEAN member States\r\nwere able to develop the ASEAN Regional Programme\r\non HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control for the period\r\n1995-2000.\r\nOur ASEAN leaders continued to strengthen their\r\ncommitment to intensify efforts to combat HIV/AIDS\r\nwhen they met during the seventh ASEAN Summit in\r\nBrunei Darussalam in November last year — just five\r\nmonths after the special session. A Declaration on\r\nHIV/AIDS was adopted, and the leaders also endorsed\r\nthe Second ASEAN Work Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\nfor the period 2002-2005 to implement the provisions\r\ncontained in the Declaration. Both the Declaration and\r\nthe Work Programme were the result of extensive\r\nconsultations with the affected communities, including\r\nthose living with HIV/AIDS. It covers not only the\r\nhealth sector but all those related to HIV/AIDS.\r\nHIV/AIDS is now a national and regional priority\r\nin South-east Asia. ASEAN continues to strengthen its\r\nefforts, including in areas related to regional\r\nnetworking; access to drugs for people living with\r\nAIDS; mobile communities; inter-sectoral\r\ncollaboration; research; improving HIV/AIDS\r\nsurveillance; education and awareness programmes for\r\nyoung people and drug users; and other areas, to reduce\r\nvulnerability to HIV/AIDS transmission and to ensure\r\nthe provision of care and support for people living with\r\nAIDS.\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that the\r\nimplementation of the Second ASEAN Work\r\nProgramme is now well under way, with the holding of\r\nvarious projects and activities related to joint actions to\r\nincrease the affordability of drugs and testing reagents;\r\nmainstreaming HIV/AIDS into the development\r\nagenda; inter-country activities on mobile populations;\r\nand the ASEAN AIDS Information and Research\r\nReference Network.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to\r\nUNAIDS for its continued and invaluable support for\r\nour regional efforts. We are also pleased to see that\r\nbodies of the United Nations system such as the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations\r\nInternational Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) and\r\nothers such as the World Health Organization and the\r\nWorld Bank are actively incorporating the issue of\r\nHIV/AIDS in their development, technical and funding\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe look forward to strengthening cooperation\r\nwith our dialogue partners and other international\r\nagencies in realizing our collective goals. In addition,\r\nwe welcome the convening of the 15th International\r\nConference on AIDS, which will be held in our region,\r\nhosted by Thailand, from 11 to 16 July 2004, and we\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nlook forward to active participation and contributions\r\nby all concerned.\r\nIt is clear that HIV/AIDS will remain one of the\r\nmost serious social and economic problems to confront\r\nus in the coming decades. It is in our best interests,\r\ntherefore, that we resolve to prevent the further spread\r\nof the disease and to continue our fervent search for a\r\ncure. In that context, we in ASEAN reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to do our utmost, individually and\r\ncollectively, in addressing HIV/AIDS and supporting\r\ngreater action and collaboration by the many\r\nstakeholders in tackling the pandemic.\r\nMr. De Alba (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation would like to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report on progress towards implementation of\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, as well\r\nas for his personal commitment to combating that\r\nepidemic, which is already considered to be the worst\r\nin the history of humankind.\r\nWe also express our appreciation to the secretariat\r\nof the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS), and in particular to its Executive Director.\r\nMy delegation supports the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report with regard\r\nto the redoubled efforts that the United Nations will\r\nhave to make in order to attain the objectives set out in\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has become a global\r\nemergency that threatens the security and development\r\nof all countries, not just those located in the worst\r\naffected regions. This emergency will require an\r\nenergetic response based on collective action by\r\ncountries through international cooperation.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report presents us with\r\nthe stark fact that 40 million people worldwide are\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS, and the statistics show that the\r\nsituation is worsening. According to information from\r\nUNAIDS, the social and economic consequences of the\r\nepidemic manifest themselves most dramatically\r\napproximately 10 years after HIV appears in each\r\ncountry or region. Taking into account the fact that\r\nthere are 5 million estimated new infections each year,\r\nthe cost for the world will be enormous, even if the\r\nepidemic is quickly brought under control.\r\nIn sub-Saharan Africa and South and South-East\r\nAsia, regions that are home to more than 34 million of\r\nthose affected by HIV/AIDS — 86 per cent of the\r\nworld total — only some 60,000 people are receiving\r\nanti-retroviral therapy. If we do not significantly\r\nbolster the global response to HIV/AIDS, it has been\r\nestimated that between 2002 and 2010 there will be 45\r\nmillion new infections. If, on the other hand, available\r\npreventative measures were extended with a view to\r\ncombating the epidemic, we could avoid 28 million\r\nsuch infections.\r\nUNAIDS has also reminded us of the enormous\r\nfunding challenges that we must overcome. We must\r\nmove from the $2.8 billion that will probably be\r\ndevoted to combating the epidemic in 2002 to $10.5\r\nbillion per year from 2005 and $15 billion per year\r\nfrom 2007.\r\nDespite the enormous challenges that we face in\r\nthe short, medium and long term, the report of the\r\nSecretary-General also provides us with encouraging\r\ninformation. First, the report emphasizes that the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS was a\r\nwatershed in our joint efforts to control this global\r\nscourge. Secondly, it highlights the fact that over the\r\npast 16 months, enormous progress has been made,\r\nboth in mobilizing human and financial resources and\r\nin designing strategies and cooperation programmes.\r\nThe Government of Mexico reaffirms its support\r\nfor the principles of the Millennium Declaration, the\r\nUNAIDS Framework for Global Leadership and the\r\njoint strategic plan of UNAIDS and the Global Fund to\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Strengthening\r\nthem will help to strengthen global security.\r\nMexico actively participated in the special\r\nsession on HIV/AIDS, and put forward proposals to\r\ndeal with the impact of AIDS on women’s health, to\r\nreduce the vulnerability of young people to the disease\r\nand to provide special care for orphaned children. It\r\nhas also promoted respect for the human rights of\r\npeople who are infected, with a view to preventing\r\ndiscrimination and stigmatization.\r\nFor the Mexican Government, the epidemic is a\r\nserious public health problem with social, economic\r\nand political consequences. Accordingly, combating it\r\nis a priority that must involve the public and private\r\nsector, specialists and educational institutions, civil\r\nsociety organizations, individuals and communities. In\r\naccordance with the recommendations made at the\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly, Mexico,\r\nthrough its Health Secretariat, has adopted a\r\nprogramme of action for the prevention and control of\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nHIV/AIDS for the period 2001-2006. The Government\r\nof Mexico is giving priority to, first, education\r\nstrategies and preventive measures; secondly, policies\r\naimed at the prevention of perinatal HIV/AIDS; thirdly,\r\naccess to information and treatment to prevent\r\nperinatal transmission of HIV and syphilis; fourthly,\r\ndiscounted prices for anti-retroviral drugs; fifthly, the\r\nestablishment of mechanisms to penalize individuals,\r\nbusinesses and institutions that violate the provisions\r\nof Mexican regulations for the prevention and control\r\nof HIV/AIDS; and sixthly, campaigns to combat\r\ndiscrimination against people infected with the virus.\r\nMexico recognizes the importance of the\r\ninternational community’s strengthening and\r\nintensifying its cooperation with and technical\r\nassistance for countries with a high incidence of\r\nHIV/AIDS and few resources. Mexico therefore\r\nsupports multisectoral, regional and international\r\ncooperation as a fundamental element in the global\r\nresponse to the pandemic. In this context, we have\r\nworked actively with the countries of Central America\r\nand the Caribbean to prevent and control HIV/AIDS. In\r\na collaborative effort with the ministers for health of\r\nthe region, important activities have been carried out in\r\nthe framework of the Central American cooperation\r\nprogramme for 2001-2002, through a project to\r\nstrengthen the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS,\r\nwith special attention to the migrant population.\r\nFurthermore, in June 2002, an intensive course\r\nentitled “HIV/AIDS: Watchfulness, Prevention and\r\nCare”, was held in Mexico, organized by the National\r\nInstitute for Public Health. That course was attended\r\nby specialists from seven countries of the Central\r\nAmerican region, as well as by Spanish- and French-\r\nspeaking Caribbean countries.\r\nMy delegation believes that the eradication of\r\nAIDS would benefit the entire world, and funding and\r\ncooperation to combat this scourge must therefore\r\noccupy a priority position in the policies of multilateral\r\nbodies, bilateral donors and private foundations.\r\nThe Government of Mexico believes that the\r\nAIDS pandemic has very grave implications for\r\ninternational security. The immediate future of the\r\nworld will depend on the capacity of the United\r\nNations to deal with it.\r\nMr. Singh (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on progress towards\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS (A/57/227). The report is fair and balanced,\r\nas well as useful.\r\nThe report states that the Declaration of\r\nCommitment established, “for the first time ever, time-\r\nbound targets to which Governments and the United\r\nNations may be held accountable”. The purpose of\r\ntoday’s debate is to consider the report with the\r\nobjective of taking stock of progress achieved in\r\nrealizing the commitments set out in the Declaration,\r\nwith a view to identifying problems and constraints and\r\nmaking recommendations on actions needed to make\r\nfurther progress. Such actions would, in our view, also\r\ninclude measures required for the further refinement of\r\nthe mechanisms used for measuring progress.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report arrives at the\r\nconclusion that, in the absence of a substantial\r\nstrengthening of the global response to HIV/AIDS, 45\r\nmillion new infections are projected to occur between\r\n2002 and 2010. It bases this conclusion on the finding\r\nthat only 15 per cent or so of the people at risk of HIV\r\ninfection have access to basic protective services, that\r\nonly 4 per cent of people in low- and middle-income\r\ncountries who qualify for anti-retroviral therapy obtain\r\nit and that even the coverage for preventing mother-to-\r\nchild transmission is only 10 per cent.\r\nThe report finds that the political commitment to\r\nimplement the Declaration of Commitment continues\r\nto increase and that spending on HIV/AIDS in low- and\r\nmiddle-income countries increased by more than 50 per\r\ncent in this year alone. It, however, also points out that\r\nthe implementation of national AIDS strategies is slow,\r\nin large measure owing to lack of resources. According\r\nto the report, only 60,000 people in sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica, South and South-East Asia receive anti-\r\nretroviral therapy. The high cost of anti-retroviral drugs\r\nis cited as the principal barrier to care. The report finds\r\nfurther that debt repayment has, in many cases,\r\nimpeded the capacity of countries to allocate sufficient\r\nresources to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment was\r\nunambiguous in asserting that the HIV/AIDS challenge\r\ncannot be met without new and sustained additional\r\nresources. This led to the establishment of a Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to\r\nfinance an urgent and expanded response. We are\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\npleased that the Fund has approved grants for projects\r\ntotalling $616 million for the next five years. We\r\nunderstand, however, that the Fund has found\r\nadditional certain projects meritorious and has, in\r\nprinciple, approved them, totalling a much larger\r\nquantum of money. The shortfall in international\r\nresources to finance these projects is estimated to be $2\r\nbillion for 2003. For 2004, the figure is $4.6 billion.\r\nIn our view, it is important to diligently track\r\nprogress towards the fulfilment of the commitments\r\nthat we have undertaken. The Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), along with its\r\nco-sponsors, have developed core indicators for\r\nmonitoring such progress. These indicators will\r\nmeasure, at the country level, the percentage of HIV-\r\ninfected pregnant women receiving the complete\r\ncourse of anti-retroviral prophylaxis, the percentage of\r\npeople with advanced HIV infection receiving anti-\r\nretroviral combination therapy and the percentage of\r\npeople with sexually transmitted diseases who have\r\nbeen appropriately diagnosed, treated and counselled.\r\nThe indicators will, however, not measure commitment\r\nat the country level to international development\r\nassistance for combating HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nwas not adopted in a meeting of the Group of 77. It was\r\nadopted by a special session of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly and represents, we think, a global\r\ncompact bringing together all Member States, both\r\ndeveloped and developing. It is clear from the report\r\nthat the compact will remain unfulfilled unless\r\ncommitments are met by all parties, both developed\r\nand developing. In order for there to be any meaningful\r\ntracking of progress, we call on UNAIDS to further\r\nrefine the mechanisms that it proposes to use for this\r\npurpose.\r\nIndia, despite its resource constraints, has been\r\ndoing its share as a responsible member of the\r\ninternational community. The role played by its\r\npharmaceutical industry has been responsible for the\r\nreduction in the cost of anti-retrovirals by 85 to 90 per\r\ncent in most developing countries. The World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Ministerial Declaration of\r\nNovember 2001, which clarified that the Agreement on\r\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\r\n(TRIPS Agreement) could and should be interpreted in\r\na manner supportive of the right of Member States to\r\nprotect public health and promote access to medicines,\r\nrepresents some movement on the part of our\r\ndevelopment partners as well. India is now working on\r\nwhat could become a fairly substantive contribution to\r\nthe prevention of HIV/AIDS. There is on-going\r\nresearch in India, both original and collaborative, in the\r\narea of vaccine development. Recent breakthroughs in\r\ngenomics and related areas offer possibilities. We are\r\nfocusing on the C subtype of the HIV virus, which is\r\nprevalent in India and some other developing countries.\r\nWe have already, through biotechnology research,\r\nmade a breakthrough in HIV diagnostic kits. Two of\r\nthem, in particular, have been successful in India and\r\nmany other countries. We would be happy to share\r\nthese technologies.\r\nI will now say a few words about our national\r\nprogramme. We have had, since 1992, a National\r\nStrategic Plan on HIV/AIDS. The second phase of the\r\nNational AIDS Control Programme, initiated in 1994,\r\nis a multisectoral programme aimed at reducing the\r\nspread of infection and strengthening capacity to\r\nrespond to the spread of the disease on a long-term\r\nbasis. Our strong political commitment, which cuts\r\nacross party lines, is evidenced by the establishment of\r\na parliamentary forum on HIV/AIDS prevention. Over\r\n700 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are\r\ninvolved in the implementation of targeted intervention\r\nprojects for high-risk groups. We make extensive use\r\nof the electronic and print media to disseminate\r\nHIV/AIDS messages in all the languages used in our\r\ncountry. India’s health system provides free treatment\r\nfor opportunistic infections in HIV-positive persons. A\r\nprogramme to prevent mother-to-child transmission is\r\nalso being implemented. Adolescent information needs\r\nare being addressed through a school aids programme.\r\nIn addition to programmes for raising general\r\nawareness regarding safe sex, there are specific\r\nprogrammes that focus on sex workers, men who have\r\nsex with men, street children, injecting drug users and\r\nmigrant workers. Special emphasis is placed on the\r\nright to privacy of individuals who are vulnerable to or\r\naffected by HIV/AIDS. We hope, with these efforts, to\r\nachieve our time-bound national targets, which are\r\nconsistent with those contained in the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS.\r\nA variety of strategies is required to address both\r\nthe preventive aspects and the care and support aspects\r\nof HIV/AIDS. What is required is to fulfil the\r\ncommitments undertaken by the international\r\ncommunity as a whole, developed and developing\r\nalike, in the special session on HIV/AIDS. We need to\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nmonitor progress towards the fulfilment of those\r\ncommitments.\r\nMr. Ivanov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): At the\r\noutset, the delegation of Belarus wishes to express its\r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for his report on the\r\nsubject before us today. We believe that the report is an\r\nimportant source of information on how the\r\ninternational community should act to combat the\r\nspread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in order to achieve\r\nthe indicators agreed upon at the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Belarus had the\r\nhonour of making a practical contribution to the\r\npreparation of the Secretary-General’s report by\r\nproviding detailed information for the corresponding\r\nquestionnaire.\r\nWith the adoption of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, we agreed that the\r\nmeasure of our success should lie in responsible\r\ncoordinated action at all levels — national, regional\r\nand global. In that connection, we should like to briefly\r\naddress some practical steps that are being taken by the\r\nPresident, Government and civil society of Belarus to\r\nfulfil the provisions of the decisions taken at the\r\ntwenty-sixth special session.\r\nWith regard to leadership, Belarus has developed\r\na State programme for the prevention of HIV infection\r\nfor the period 2001-2005, as well as a strategic plan for\r\nforward-looking measures to prevent the expansion of\r\nthe epidemic from the period 2001 to 2003. Those\r\nstrategies provide for a number of measures in terms of\r\norganizational, legal, preventive and rehabilitation\r\nmeasures among various groups of highly vulnerable\r\npopulations. They include the organization of activities\r\nfor the prevention of HIV infection for drug users and\r\nthe development within educational institutions of\r\nprogrammes on healthy living, including prevention of\r\nHIV infection and publicizing the use of contraceptives\r\namong young people, spreading prevention information\r\nthroughout institutions that provide assistance to\r\npeople with AIDS and planning programmes for people\r\nat high risk of infection. Action in those areas involves\r\nthe participation of different sectors of society,\r\nincluding non-governmental organizations, ministries\r\nand departments.\r\nRegarding care, support and treatment, the State\r\nprogramme for AIDS prevention provides for the free\r\nprovision of anti-retroviral drugs to HIV-positive\r\npersons at medical institutions, as well as distribution\r\nthrough pharmacy networks. At the same time,\r\nresearch shows that our country is currently\r\nencountering difficulties in providing a multi-\r\ncomponent HIV-infection therapy, largely because of\r\nthe limited number of authorized medicines and\r\nbecause of their high cost. Work is therefore being\r\ndone to introduce mechanisms that will make it\r\npossible to develop local production, in keeping with\r\ninternational standards. With a view to expanding\r\nopportunities for HIV-infection therapy, Belarus is\r\nproviding a local product called Zametcit. Use of that\r\nlocal product will make it possible to reduce costs and\r\nensure greater access. We are currently considering the\r\nissue of simplifying the registration procedure for\r\nimported anti-retroviral preparations, which will\r\nexpand the list of medicines that can be used.\r\nRegarding HIV/AIDS and human rights, people\r\nwith HIV/AIDS are guaranteed the rights of all\r\ncitizens, as set out in the Constitution of Belarus.\r\nMoreover, there is a set of legislative acts that reflects\r\ndifferent aspects of the HIV/AIDS problem.\r\nDiscrimination is prohibited, the interests and rights of\r\nHIV-infected persons are guaranteed, the principle of\r\nconfidentiality is assured and the rights and legitimate\r\ninterests of relatives may not be infringed upon.\r\nAs to research and development, we have\r\nelaborated a national system for monitoring HIV\r\ninfection, including through the study of the scope of\r\nHIV infection among risk groups. We have introduced\r\ncomputer-based standard systems of accountability.\r\nHIV/AIDS-related issues are included in programmes\r\nfor medical workers and specialized training is\r\nprovided. Training of sociologists working on\r\nHIV/AIDS-related research is carried out at seminars\r\ninvolving international consultants. The training of\r\nspecialists working with groups at risk is being\r\nconducted at national and international seminars and\r\ntraining sessions.\r\nOne of the main obstacles to carrying out those\r\nmeasures at the national level is the lack of resources\r\nand technical potential; we fully agree with the\r\nSecretary-General’s conclusion on that point.\r\nApproaching its obligations responsibly, Belarus,\r\nnevertheless, is not now in a position to greatly\r\nincrease the volume of financing for corresponding\r\nState programmes. That is due to the transitional nature\r\nof our economy, which is experiencing difficult social\r\nand economic changes. The situation is also\r\nparticularly difficult for our country because of the fact\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nthat the HIV/AIDS problem is not just a national\r\nproblem but, to a considerable extent, an imported one.\r\nIt is very closely linked to dangerous phenomena such\r\nas illegal drug traffic and illegal migration. Here we\r\nlook for the support and understanding of the\r\ninternational community. Such support appears to us to\r\nbe fully justified because, as can be seen from the\r\nrecent report of the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS, the Eastern European region, to which our\r\ncountry belongs, unfortunately has the highest current\r\nrate of increase in infection.\r\nBelarus has initiated practical cooperation with\r\nthe Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria, with a view to mobilizing international\r\nsupport for its own efforts. We also greatly appreciate\r\nour interaction with the World Bank in combating the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS in Belarus.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express my country’s\r\nconviction that the support of a dedicated, coordinated\r\nand comprehensive international approach to\r\ncombating HIV/AIDS will enable us to achieve\r\nprogress with a view to attaining the objectives on\r\nwhich we have agreed.\r\nMs. Løj (Denmark): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The Central and\r\nEastern Europe countries associated with the European\r\nUnion — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia\r\nand Slovenia — and the associated countries Cyprus,\r\nMalta and Turkey, as well as the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation country member of the European\r\nEconomic Area, Iceland, align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, our heads of State or\r\nGovernment resolved by 2015 to have halted and\r\nbegun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, the scourge\r\nof malaria and other major diseases that afflict\r\nhumanity. This commitment was followed up last year\r\nin June when we all met at the special session and\r\nadopted the United Nations Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS. The Declaration sets out a\r\nnumber of concrete and time-bound goals, which\r\nconstitute an important framework for our actions in\r\nthe global fight against HIV/AIDS. But it is after all\r\njust a Declaration; our true commitment must be shown\r\nthrough our joint actions. We have a great challenge in\r\ntranslating political commitment into action.\r\nThe consequences of the epidemic are alarming.\r\nIn 2001, 5 million people became infected with HIV\r\nand 3 million died from AIDS. Today, more than 40\r\nmillion are living with HIV/AIDS. The disease has a\r\nmajor impact — and in some areas, especially in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, a devastating one — on life. However,\r\nit is also expanding rapidly in other regions of the\r\nworld, which, unless early action is taken, threaten to\r\nbe engulfed by the epidemic. It halts social and\r\neconomic development; thousands of children are left\r\nas orphans; and it contributes to a shortage of food, a\r\nslowing in production and lower education standards.\r\nThere is an urgent need for a strengthened effort\r\nto fight HIV/AIDS. The response required is more\r\ncomplex than that to other diseases. It requires action\r\nthrough all aspects of society, not just health. Our\r\nefforts to fight HIV/AIDS must therefore be an integral\r\npart of our work in all fields — in relation to\r\neducation, agriculture, industrial development, trade,\r\nhuman rights and social development. It is a true cross-\r\ncutting issue and must be treated accordingly.\r\nMany countries have developed multisectoral\r\nplans and strategies for combating HIV/AIDS, but the\r\nconcrete responses to the epidemic often remain\r\nenclosed in health ministries. This must be changed.\r\nThe epidemic should be counteracted through a broad\r\nset of interventions. The capacity to coordinate a wide\r\nrange of initiatives must be enhanced. Taking into\r\naccount the multisectoral nature of the problem, the\r\nneed to ensure ownership of national Governments and\r\nthe proper coordination as well as cooperation of the\r\nvarious actors, all HIV/AIDS activities should be\r\nintegrated into national poverty reduction programmes,\r\nsuch as the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General rightly\r\nunderlines the crucial importance of national leadership\r\nin the fight against HIV/AIDS. We must speak openly\r\nabout HIV/AIDS and confront stigmatization and\r\ndiscrimination. Sexual health education for young\r\npersons is part of such openness, as is recognizing the\r\ngender dimensions of HIV/AIDS and the importance of\r\nthe active involvement of men and boys in prevention\r\nefforts. Only by doing so can we achieve the maximum\r\nimpact of our efforts.\r\nCivil society forms an intrinsic part of a national\r\nresponse. It is imperative that we complement political\r\nleadership with the full and active participation of civil\r\nsociety, including people living with HIV/AIDS, as\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nwell as the private sector. This is indeed happening in\r\nmany countries. However, in the global perspective\r\nparticipation remains inadequate. The EU would like to\r\nacknowledge and support the role played by civil\r\nsociety through participation in planning exercises, in\r\nproviding care and support to orphans and other\r\nvulnerable groups, and in monitoring HIV-related\r\nhuman rights violations.\r\nLast year, United Nations Member States at the\r\nGeneral Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS agreed\r\nthat by 2005 we would mobilize in total between $7\r\nand $10 billion a year to fight the epidemic. The\r\nestablishment of the Global Fund to fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria provides an important global\r\nfinancial mechanism for securing the necessary\r\nresources for the fight against the three diseases. The\r\nEU is committed to helping the Global Fund establish\r\nitself as an effective mechanism for the delivery of\r\nessential support to those most in need.\r\nIn Monterrey, we agreed to increase the resources\r\nfor development — both domestic resources and\r\nassistance from the international community — and to\r\nenhance aid effectiveness. This should include\r\nprioritizing interventions that are known to be effective\r\nin responding to HIV/AIDS. We must increase\r\nspending in health and education if we are to achieve\r\nby 2015 the goal of halting and reversing the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS. An increase in official development\r\nassistance and the speedy and effective implementation\r\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\r\nwill, among other things, be targeted towards the social\r\nsector and contribute to freeing domestic resources for\r\nsocial sector investment.\r\nBut lack of financial resources is not the only\r\nobstacle. Human capacity, especially at the country\r\nlevel, is stretched beyond its limits. Indeed, we are now\r\nreaching the point where the extent to which\r\nHIV/AIDS is contributing to the erosion of human\r\ncapacity to respond to the disease must be\r\nacknowledged. External assistance often supports\r\nspecific interventions but pays less attention to the\r\nchallenge of building sufficient capacity at the local\r\nlevel in order to sustain these activities over the long\r\nterm. In a situation of insufficient capacity, the scaling-\r\nup of successful pilot projects, which could increase\r\nefforts aimed at combating HIV/AIDS, may not yield\r\nsustainable results.\r\nThe United Nations system must address this\r\nchallenge through strengthened inter-agency\r\ncollaboration, especially at the country level, with a\r\nview to ensuring the most effective utilization of its\r\nresources. The effectiveness of strategies to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS depends very much on improved\r\ncoordination and coherence between all stakeholders at\r\nthe global, regional, national and local levels. In this\r\ncontext, the EU welcomes the ongoing evaluation of\r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS). The EU very much looks forward to the\r\ndebate on the findings of the evaluation at the\r\nProgramme Coordinating Board of UNAIDS, to be\r\nheld in Portugal in December this year. Further\r\nconsideration in order to strengthen the mandate of\r\nUNAIDS might be called for by the Economic and\r\nSocial Council.\r\nThe EU stands ready to intensify its efforts, also\r\nthrough the United Nations system — and above all\r\nUNAIDS — aimed at eliminating the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS. We would like to stress the important role\r\nthat UNAIDS plays in coordinating the United Nations\r\nresponse to HIV/AIDS. We would like to reaffirm the\r\nimportance we attach to an enhanced but balanced\r\napproach in order to address all dimensions of the\r\nepidemic. Prevention must be the mainstay of our\r\nresponse. Prevention and treatment are complementary\r\nin a fundamental way and care, support and treatment\r\ntogether are closely linked to effective prevention. We\r\nunderscore the need to develop national and sectoral\r\npolicies and plans, in which reproductive health care\r\nand services, and population — including focusing on\r\nadolescents — and gender issues are integrated, along\r\nwith the need to strengthen primary health care systems\r\nand community-based care.\r\nThe EU is working actively to increase access to\r\nand affordability of key pharmaceuticals and to\r\npromote research into and development of new global\r\npublic goods to confront HIV/AIDS. The EU Action\r\nPlan on aid for poverty diseases in developing\r\ncountries provides a comprehensive package of\r\ninterventions for the three major communicable\r\ndiseases — HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria — and\r\nincludes actions at all levels related to development,\r\ntrade and research in order to improve health\r\nconditions and access to medicines.\r\nIn conclusion, we agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that the United Nations is a unique instrument\r\navailable to the world for dealing with critical global\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.44\r\nissues, such as the fight against HIV/AIDS. We would\r\nalso in this context like to highlight the importance we\r\nattach to the Secretary-General’s initiative to\r\nstrengthen the United Nations. Thus, we have to point\r\nout the need to ensure coherence between the follow-up\r\nto the special session on HIV/AIDS, the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and other major United Nations\r\nconferences and summits. We must also take a holistic\r\napproach to the monitoring and evaluation of our\r\nefforts in relation to HIV/AIDS, and find a way to\r\ninvolve all stakeholders, including civil society, in our\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker on the list for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting was adjourned at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
