(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Pfanzelter\r\n(Austria), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 42 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession: implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/227 and\r\nA/57/227/Corr.1)\r\nMr. Kondakov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The HIV/AIDS pandemic seriously hinders\r\nachieving the development goals established in the\r\nMillennium Declaration and other key documents\r\nadopted at recent major United Nations forums. This\r\nproblem is urgent for all countries of the world without\r\nexception. The severity of the problem is obvious, not\r\nonly in Africa but also in Central and Eastern Europe,\r\nwhere, as members know, we have recently seen the\r\nhighest rates of HIV/AIDS prevalence.\r\nThis unfortunate situation also exists in Russia,\r\nwhere HIV-infected people number more than 200,000.\r\nIt is particularly alarming that 70 per cent of them\r\ncome from the working population, ranging from 15 to\r\n30 years of age. The number of HIV-infected women\r\nof childbearing years is growing.\r\nThe Government of Russia is taking very serious,\r\ncomprehensive action in this area. A federal law to\r\nprevent the spread in the Russian Federation of\r\ndiseases caused by the human immunodeficiency virus\r\nhas come into force. A special federal programme on\r\nthe prevention and combat of social diseases for the\r\nperiod 2002-2006 is being implemented, including a\r\nspecial subprogramme to combat HIV/AIDS. A\r\nprogramme to prevent mother-to-child transmission has\r\nbeen developed, and active cooperation is under way\r\nwith our partners in the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates (CIS) in the framework of the document signed\r\non 13 May 2002, creating a programme of urgent\r\nmeasures to combat the spread of the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic in CIS countries. International cooperation is\r\na significant support to our own efforts in combating\r\nthis pandemic. We hail the cooperation in this area\r\nthrough the United Nations system, primarily under the\r\nauspices of the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health\r\nOrganization, and that involving other international\r\ninstitutions, in particular the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In our view, we need\r\nto step up efforts to mobilize resources for the Global\r\nFund.\r\nAs is known, Russia contributed $1 million to the\r\nFund in 2002. In our view, the fight against HIV/AIDS\r\nis now entering a new phase. Previously, creating the\r\nnecessary resource base was the most urgent task. Now,\r\nwhat has become most urgent is making the most\r\neffective use of the resources and improving the\r\nstrategy for combating HIV/AIDS.\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nThe basic components for that strategy should be\r\na properly balanced combination of prevention and\r\ntreatment, on the one hand, and a broad-based, targeted\r\neducational campaign, on the other. Education is the\r\nmost important component of the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. We need to devise special programmes\r\naimed at certain groups of the population — drug\r\naddicts, migrant workers, sex workers and young\r\npeople. We see great potential for a role to be played\r\nby UNICEF, by the World Health Organization and by\r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in\r\nthe development of matrices for educational\r\nmethodologies that could be fine-tuned for specific\r\nregions and countries. In addition, we think that\r\nassistance should be given to the training of qualified\r\ninstructors.\r\nEqually important are the social and human-rights\r\naspects of the fight against HIV/AIDS. Therefore, we\r\nbelieve that consideration should be given to\r\nestablishing agreed guidelines for the development of\r\nnational legal guarantees for a non-discriminatory\r\napproach towards those who are left vulnerable as a\r\nresult of HIV/AIDS. It is important that proper medical\r\nand social services be provided for HIV-infected\r\nfamilies, to overcome the social stigmas associated\r\nwith the disease, to resolve problems related to the\r\ndeath of HIV-infected persons in a humane way and to\r\ndevelop a hospice network. We think that such an\r\napproach, combining medical, social, institutional and\r\nlegal measures, would definitely improve our\r\neffectiveness in dealing with one of the most dangerous\r\nplagues of our age — that is, within the framework of\r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe successful attainment of the goals of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS requires a\r\ncomprehensive, intersectoral approach towards public\r\nhealth as it is linked to economic development. That is\r\nhow the report of the Secretary-General on progress in\r\nimplementing the Declaration approaches the problem\r\nof HIV/AIDS. We value the report, particularly because\r\nit contains well-balanced conclusions and useful\r\nrecommendations for further measures to implement\r\nthe Declaration’s goals. We support those conclusions\r\nand recommendations.\r\nMr. Manalo (Philippines): At the outset, I wish\r\nto emphasize the great importance that my delegation\r\nattaches to this agenda item. In that regard, I wish to\r\nreaffirm my Government’s commitment to addressing\r\nthe problem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects at the\r\nnational, regional and international levels. My\r\ndelegation also wishes to express its appreciation for\r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on progress towards\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS (A/57/227 and Corr.1).\r\nToday, the scale of the AIDS crisis outstrips even\r\nthe worst-case scenarios of a decade ago. Dozens of\r\ncountries are in the grip of the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\r\nand many more are at the brink. Based on current\r\ntrends, it is projected that, between 2000 and 2020, 68\r\nmillion people will die from AIDS in 45 of the most\r\naffected countries. Moreover, the HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nshows no sign of levelling off in the hardest-hit\r\ncountries, and as much as $10 billion is needed\r\nannually to fight it effectively. HIV/AIDS is a global\r\nhealth catastrophe that has decimated populations and\r\nleft millions of children bereft of care, guidance and a\r\nsecure future. By diminishing the number of productive\r\ncitizens, it has also retarded economic growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nestablishes time-bound targets to which Governments\r\nshould be held. The Declaration calls for an expanded\r\nglobal response in areas including leadership;\r\nprevention, care and support; human rights; orphans\r\nand children left vulnerable; research and development;\r\nand resources. We also support the United Nations\r\nsystem’s framework for accelerated action on\r\nHIV/AIDS in four key areas. These include advocacy,\r\nincluding promotion of the Declaration and its\r\nendorsement by global and regional conferences;\r\nnormative guidance and operational support, with an\r\nemphasis on guidance for United Nations country\r\nteams; communications and public information; and\r\ncivil society support. In that regard, we welcome the\r\nefforts of the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS for its monitoring and evaluation\r\nframework, tailored to the Declaration’s goals and\r\ntargets at both the global and national levels.\r\nI wish to inform the Assembly that the principles\r\nof the Declaration are embodied in a Philippine law\r\nadopted in 1998. That law articulates the State’s intent\r\nto mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS across all sectors\r\nof our society. Following the strong commitments\r\nmade by our Government through its acceptance of the\r\ngoals and time-bound targets set by the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, the Philippines has taken\r\naction in support of those goals and targets. In that\r\nregard, our Government submitted a $35 million\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nproposal last September to the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, of which $13 million\r\nwas proposed for the HIV/AIDS component.\r\nThe Philippines, in partnership with the United\r\nNations Development Programme, also hosted a\r\ncollaborative meeting among member countries of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in\r\nthe Greater Mekong Delta in April 2001. The\r\nPhilippine experience served as the ASEAN model for\r\nresponses to HIV/AIDS-related vulnerability among\r\nmigrant workers. We have also participated actively in\r\nother international conferences on HIV/AIDS. At the\r\nregional level, an ASEAN task force on HIV/AIDS has\r\nbeen established. One of its recent activities, in which\r\nthe Philippines participated, was the exchange of\r\ninformation during exploratory meetings on increasing\r\naccess to HIV/AIDS drugs, held last June in Indonesia.\r\nWe will continue to support programmes that\r\nenhance regional and international networking,\r\nincluding South-South cooperation programmes on best\r\npractices with regard to dealing with this growing\r\npandemic. We also support efforts to mainstream the\r\nHIV/AIDS issue into the development agenda, as it is a\r\nserious challenge to a people’s health and to a nation’s\r\nsustained growth and development. In that regard,\r\nalternative job opportunities should be provided to\r\nreintegrate people living with AIDS into their families\r\nand communities.\r\nWhile many countries have developed national\r\nAIDS strategies aimed at meeting the global and\r\nnational challenges encountered in implementing the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, the\r\nalarming magnitude and spread of this deadly disease\r\nurgently require focused and concerted action on the\r\npart of all nations.\r\nMr. Briz Gutiérrez (Guatemala) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nmember States of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem — Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua and Panama — as well as on\r\nbehalf of the Dominican Republic, in its capacity as\r\nobserver.\r\nFirst of all, I should like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for preparing and submitting the report on\r\nprogress towards implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (A/57/227 and Corr.1). The\r\nreport not only gives us an idea of the progress made\r\nsince the adoption of the Declaration of Commitment\r\non HIV/AIDS, but it also serves us by focusing on\r\nareas in which greater efforts are still required.\r\nData recently provided by the Joint United\r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS show that, far from\r\nhaving stabilized as it was expected to do some time\r\nago, the epidemic continues to spread. Here, we hail\r\nthe efforts being made in Africa and in Asia, where\r\ncountries such as Uganda, Zambia and Cambodia offer\r\ncommendable models of how to reverse the course of\r\ngeneralized epidemic through firm political\r\ncommitments and large-scale prevention programmes,\r\ncarried out despite unfavourable socio-economic\r\nconditions.\r\nWe further express our solidarity with our\r\nCaribbean brothers who, by reason of their adult HIV\r\nprevalence rates, live in the second most affected area\r\nin the world after sub-Saharan Africa. We praise the\r\nefforts they are making at the regional level through\r\nthe Pan-Caribbean Partnership, which are coordinated\r\nby the secretariat of the Caribbean Community.\r\nIn the case of Central America and the Dominican\r\nRepublic, reports indicate that in some countries the\r\nestimated prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is\r\nequal to or higher than 1 per cent due especially to the\r\nfact that the epidemic is deeply rooted in the general\r\npopulation. In addition, the same reports show that the\r\ncombination of uneven socio-economic development\r\nand the considerable mobility of the population are\r\nfactors that favour the spread of HIV in Central\r\nAmerica, with the epidemic concentrated chiefly in\r\nsocially marginalized groups. Population mobility is\r\nbecoming a significant factor in the spread of the\r\nepidemic to the extent that some recent research\r\nunderscores the need for interventions at frontier posts\r\nand transit stations with a view to protecting migrant\r\nworkers and sex workers from infection.\r\nProtecting vulnerable mobile populations,\r\nincluding adolescent girls and young women, is now\r\nthe focus of the AIDS and migration project, a regional\r\ninitiative established by the Governments of Central\r\nAmerica, Mexico and the United States. Were the\r\nepidemic to continue with the characteristics I have\r\nmentioned, it can be assumed on the basis of a\r\nmathematical projection that over the next 10 years it\r\ncould significantly impair productivity and\r\ndevelopment in our region.\r\nIt is for those reasons that the Governments of the\r\nCentral American Integration System (SICA) and the\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nDominican Republic have launched national AIDS\r\nprogrammes, some of which have been reviewed this\r\nyear. In formulating or reviewing many of these plans,\r\nwe have had the benefit of far-reaching participation by\r\nnon-governmental organizations, people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS, relevant ministries, human rights\r\nombudsmen, social security systems and even the\r\narmed forces.\r\nIn compliance with the Declaration of\r\nCommitment, some of our countries have initiated\r\nprogrammes for preventing mother-to-child\r\ntransmission by providing AZT to HIV-infected\r\npregnant women from the fourteenth week of\r\npregnancy and to children at the time of birth. They\r\nhave likewise concluded agreements with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations of people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS in order to provide them with antiretroviral\r\ntreatment and to enable them to contribute to\r\ninstitution-building.\r\nBut these national, regional and even\r\ninterregional efforts are not sufficient. We need the\r\nsupport of the international community. At the Latin\r\nAmerican level there has been a rapid increase in\r\nSouth-South cooperation, it being understood that\r\ngroups that exchange knowledge become more\r\npowerful and efficient. Such efforts deserve to be\r\nhighlighted. It is nevertheless essential that we\r\ncontinue to explore all the tools set out in the\r\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\r\nProperty Rights, not only to produce generic drugs, but\r\nalso to enable developing countries to protect the\r\nhealth of their populations.\r\nOur countries believe in a human-rights-based\r\napproach, and statutes have been enacted to promote\r\neducation as from the primary level, thus giving\r\npriority to prevention among the young. These laws\r\nfurther aim at preventing the HIV-related\r\nstigmatization and marginalization of vulnerable\r\npopulations and of persons who have been infected or\r\naffected by the virus.\r\nThe Governments of SICA countries and the\r\nDominican Republic wish to reaffirm the commitment\r\nwe assumed at the twenty-sixth special session, as well\r\nas our conviction that through leadership at the highest\r\nlevel it will be possible to change the HIVAIDS\r\nsituation in our region.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): The\r\nAfrican Group has honoured me by asking me to speak\r\non its behalf under agenda item 42. I accept its\r\ninvitation and am very pleased to comply with its\r\nwishes.\r\nSome figures will make it possible to construct\r\nthe horrifying picture that we see and to give an idea of\r\nthis apocalyptic vision of a terrible scourge with\r\nhorrible social, economic and humanitarian\r\nconsequences. This year HIV/AIDS will have infected\r\n27 million Africans, 75 per cent of those infected\r\nworldwide, claiming far more victims than in all\r\nAfrican conflicts or in the Second World War.\r\nChildren and young people constitute the\r\nmajority of those affected. The epidemic has had a\r\nmajor negative impact on the development of children,\r\non the reproductive health of young people and on life\r\nexpectancy, which has been shortened by 20 per cent\r\nand which has fallen well below 40 years of age.\r\nPoverty, malnutrition and illiteracy, all contribute to the\r\nspread of AIDS; the pandemic has led to the\r\nreappearance of endemic parasitic and infectious\r\ndiseases and has seriously undermined the quality of\r\nhuman resources, sustainable development, the survival\r\nof African peoples and of humanity as a whole, and\r\nhence international security, to the extent that the\r\nproblem of AIDS was for the first time placed on the\r\nagenda of the Security Council, in January 2000 (see\r\nS/PV.4087). The war on AIDS needs to be expanded\r\nand made more systematic. There needs to be an\r\nincrease in financial resources and development aid. A\r\nminimum of $3 billion a year is required, according to\r\nprojections by the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), in order to effectively combat\r\nthis pandemic in Africa alone.\r\nThis was the theme of the Second African\r\nDevelopment Forum, organized by the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa in November 2000 in Addis\r\nAbaba; of the Lome Declaration on HIV/AIDS in\r\nAfrica, adopted at the thirty-sixth Summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU); of the\r\nOuagadougou Commitment of 9 May 2000, adopted\r\nwithin the context of our international partnership\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS; and of the Declaration and\r\nFramework for Action adopted at the OAU special\r\nsummit on HIV/AIDS held in Abuja in 2001.\r\nOver the past decade or so, African heads of State\r\nor Government have adopted a wealth of resolutions\r\nand declarations raising the consciousness of\r\npopulations in Africa and throughout the world about\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nthe vital need to control this scourge through two\r\nsuccessive approaches. The first phase is to adopt\r\nprogrammes of action organized around the Dakar\r\nDeclaration on the AIDS Epidemic in Africa, adopted\r\non 1 July 1992 at the twenty-eight OAU Summit, as\r\nwell as a six-point programme of action focusing on\r\npolitical mobilization, prevention, treatment, research,\r\npartnership between the public and private sectors and\r\nexternal resources. Here I should mention also the\r\nTunis Declaration on AIDS and the Child in Africa,\r\nadopted on 15 June 1994 at the Thirtieth OAU Summit.\r\nThe second phase is that of an overall assessment\r\nof political reorientation and the reallocation of\r\nresources in the framework of a new partnership. Steps\r\ntowards this end include the decision taken at the 68th\r\nsession of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, on 7\r\nJune 1998, on the follow-up to OAU resolutions and\r\ndeclarations; the Ouagadougou Declaration, adopted at\r\nthe 34th OAU Summit, on the creation of an African\r\nfund to combat AIDS; the Algiers Declaration of the\r\n70th Council of Ministers of the OAU on cooperation\r\namong the OAU, the Joint United Nations Programme\r\non HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization and the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, in the framework of\r\nan innovative and synergetic partnership; and the\r\ncommitments undertaken at Ouagadougou by the\r\nAfrican Ministers of Health.\r\nHence, the Abuja Framework of Action and\r\nDeclaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other\r\nRelated Infectious Diseases in Africa, adopted on 25\r\nApril 2001 following the African Summit, gave new\r\nmomentum to the mobilization of our continent against\r\nthe exponential spread of this pandemic. Abuja also\r\nidentified areas requiring priority action, which were\r\ntaken up again and endorsed by the special session of\r\nthe General Assembly on HIV/AIDS, held in June 2001\r\nin New York. The Declaration of Commitment that\r\nemerged from that session highlights, inter alia, the\r\nlack of resources devoted to this epidemic; the need for\r\nnational, subregional and regional capacity-building in\r\nthe combat against AIDS and for the strengthening of\r\ninternational cooperation; and the need to forge\r\ndynamic partnerships, in particular among\r\nGovernments, the United Nations system, international\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations,\r\npharmaceutical companies, and the public and private\r\nsectors.\r\nThe Declaration also urges regional organizations\r\nand partners actively to participate in the quest for\r\nsolutions to the HIV/AIDS crisis. It also calls for\r\nsupport for regional and subregional initiatives relating\r\nto this pandemic, in particular the International\r\nPartnership against AIDS in Africa; the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa (ECA) African Development\r\nForum Consensus and Plan of Action; and the Abuja\r\nDeclaration and Framework for Action.\r\nTo sum up, the Declaration of Commitment\r\nstresses the following concerns and priorities:\r\nprevention; care; support and treatment; HIV/AIDS and\r\nhuman rights; protection for vulnerable persons and\r\nAIDS orphans; mitigation of the socio-economic\r\nimpact of the disease; research and development;\r\nHIV/AIDS in conflict areas; the question of resources;\r\nand, last but not least, the question of follow-up to the\r\nimplementation of these commitments.\r\nThis last point is crucial for Africa and for our\r\ngroup. In this respect, might I recall the following\r\nfacts.\r\nThe special session on AIDS was held largely\r\nbecause of the spread of the pandemic in Africa, but\r\nalso, and especially, because of the mobilization of our\r\ngroup and of its regional partners, which together\r\nbrought their full force to bear on the issue. More than\r\nthree quarters of the heads of State or Government who\r\nparticipated in that session were from Africa. But\r\nunfortunately, despite the commitments undertaken in\r\nJune 2001, the pandemic continues to gain ground in\r\nAfrica. The resources that we need are not yet\r\navailable, and access to antiretroviral drugs and other\r\nforms of treatment is still difficult and costly.\r\nSo how can we continue to ensure that Africa\r\nplays a key role in the continuing mobilization of\r\npeople in the fight against the pandemic? How can we\r\nensure the speedy implementation of the commitments\r\nundertaken at the special session?\r\nHumbly, I would suggest the following thoughts\r\nin response to that crucial question. I think, first, that it\r\nis important to stress the need for robust national\r\nfollow-up by our Governments in order to develop and\r\nstrengthen ongoing comprehensive follow-up action\r\nhere at the United Nations.\r\nFirst, at the national level, as stressed in the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment, we must maintain and\r\nstrengthen the momentum created at that special\r\nsession. In that context, three tasks were assigned to\r\nour Governments: periodic national assessments of the\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nprogress made and the obstacles encountered in\r\nimplementing the June 2001 commitments; the\r\ndevelopment of monitoring instruments and\r\nmechanisms, on the basis of sufficient epidemiological\r\ndata; and the promotion and protection of the\r\nfundamental rights of HIV-infected persons.\r\nFor these reasons, it is important for us all to\r\nknow what has been done and what has been planned\r\nin our various countries over the last year, in particular\r\nto put in place a bold policy of information\r\ndissemination, education and consciousness-raising,\r\ntogether with the various stakeholders, the public and\r\nprivate sectors, political and religious groups, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society, and other\r\nforces that shape public opinion.\r\nSecondly, at the regional level, the OAU — now\r\nthe African Union — and the subregional organizations\r\nmust also play a part. The General Assembly\r\nrecommended the inclusion, where appropriate, of the\r\nHIV/AIDS issue on the agenda of regional meetings\r\nheld at the ministerial or summit level. The various\r\nsubregional chapters of our group will ensure that this\r\nrecommendation is implemented within, inter alia, the\r\nArab Maghreb Union, the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States, the Central African Economic and\r\nMonetary Community and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), and during regular\r\nOAU/African Union meetings.\r\nThirdly, at the global level, I wish to recall at the\r\noutset that three main recommendations were made by\r\nthe special session: that at least an entire day during the\r\nregular session of the General Assembly be devoted to\r\nconsideration of the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe progress made in the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment, including a debate on the\r\nreport; that AIDS-related items be included on the\r\nagendas of all relevant United Nations conferences and\r\nmeetings; and that initiatives be taken to organize\r\nconferences, seminars, study days, training sessions\r\nand so on, to ensure that all questions covered in the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment are followed up, and that\r\nthe experience and expertise of our research specialists\r\nand of our human resources are shared for the benefit\r\nof all, so that we can help to create synergy of action in\r\nthe fight against this scourge.\r\nWe welcome the excellent report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on progress made in the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. This report\r\nlikewise stresses the obstacles that need to be\r\novercome and the constraints of all kinds that need to\r\nbe eliminated to speed up the effective implementation\r\nof the Declaration. As the report states, several sub-\r\nSaharan African countries have already mainstreamed\r\ninto their national strategies, or are in the process of\r\ndoing so, the goals of the Declaration, in the context of\r\nspecific time frames.\r\nAfrica welcomes the extraordinary mobilization\r\nof the entire United Nations system to implement the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment. We must also mobilize\r\nyoung people, non-governmental organizations and\r\npersons living with the disease in the context of our\r\nnational and regional strategies for combating\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nBut one cannot overemphasize the imperative\r\nneed for a substantial increase in the resources\r\nearmarked for the campaign against HIV/AIDS. A total\r\nof $10 billion will be needed by 2005 to strengthen\r\nglobal action against AIDS.\r\nThe resources of the Global Fund, which was\r\nestablished this year, must therefore be increased and\r\nconsolidated. Impact studies should also be carried out\r\nto enable us to better understand the effects of the\r\npandemic on families, communities and society in\r\ngeneral, as well as on the economic and social policies\r\nof our States. Greater attention should be paid to this\r\ndisease in regions or countries that are suffering from\r\narmed conflict.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the full\r\nsupport of the African Group for the 12\r\nrecommendations in the Secretary-General’s report. We\r\nhave no doubt whatever that the General Assembly will\r\nstrongly and unanimously endorse those\r\nrecommendations so that the priorities established for\r\n2003 can be attained.\r\nCan we rise to this tremendous challenge to\r\nhuman solidarity and build a world completely free\r\nfrom AIDS and other diseases and scourges — a world\r\nof peace and security, where extreme poverty and\r\ndestitution can be overcome? We still have time to\r\nraise our sights, because we now have real grounds for\r\nhope and a common determination to work together.\r\nBut we must start here and now.\r\nMr. Naidu (Fiji): I would like to thank the\r\nPresident for giving me the opportunity to speak on\r\nthis agenda item on the report of the Secretary-General\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\non progress towards the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, and I am\r\nhonoured to do so on behalf of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum countries with missions in New York: Australia,\r\nthe Marshall Islands, the Federated States of\r\nMicronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,\r\nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and\r\nmy own country, Fiji, as well as Kiribati and Palau.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum group also addressed the\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS, which took place in May\r\n2001, on issues which are also relevant to our\r\ndiscussion today.\r\nWe would like at the outset to note the reported\r\nsuccesses that Cambodia, Thailand, Uganda and\r\nZambia have achieved in combating the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic. Those successes give us hope that our\r\nconcerted effort is the global way forward.\r\nDespite those trends, HIV/AIDS remains the\r\nworst epidemic, and one of the greatest development,\r\nsecurity and global challenges, in human history. In the\r\nworst affected countries of the world, one quarter of\r\nthe total population is infected with the HIV/AIDS\r\nvirus. The impact of the epidemic in those countries is\r\ndisastrous: the workforce is significantly reduced;\r\nmillions of children are orphaned; and opportunities for\r\nsocial, economic and other forms of development are\r\nseriously affected. With over 40 million people living\r\nwith the virus, and given the continuing, alarming rate\r\nof infection of 5 million people every year, urgent\r\naction is imperative in order to stem the tide of this\r\nscourge.\r\nFor the Pacific region, the comparatively low rate\r\nof reported infections presents the danger of a false\r\nsense of security or of immunity against HIV/AIDS.\r\nMore realistically, the rate of HIV infection is\r\nincreasing in the Pacific region, and it remains a high-\r\nrisk area. Since the special session on HIV/AIDS last\r\nyear, positive cases have been reported in previously\r\nunaffected Forum member States. Statistics also show\r\nthat the number of those infected in some Pacific States\r\nhas doubled. The Secretary-General’s report on this\r\nglobal trend upwards is sobering. However, we take\r\ncomfort in the time-bound, quantifiable and targeted\r\ncommitments in the special session’s Declaration.\r\nThose are the benchmarks that can guide Member\r\nStates today as we begin to respond to the projections,\r\nand to the new and deviating trends that the virus is\r\nnow displaying. We recognize the important role that\r\nawareness-raising and education play in any prevention\r\ncampaign.\r\nWhile reflecting on the achievements and\r\nprogress we have made thus far in the battle against\r\nHIV/AIDS, the report reminds us of the mammoth\r\ntasks ahead in implementing commitments to combat\r\nthe pandemic. We have indeed covered considerable\r\nground in 16 months, notably in the areas of\r\nleadership, partnership and resources.\r\nLeadership at the global level has enabled the\r\ninternational community to be sensitized on\r\nHIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS has been given due prominence\r\nand focus in critical international meetings for the\r\ndecade, beginning with the Millennium Summit, the\r\nDoha Ministerial Conference and the Johannesburg\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nEfforts at the regional level include the\r\nformulation of appropriate policy directions and\r\nmechanisms and the mobilization of resources and\r\ninitiatives in the battle against the epidemic. The\r\nPacific Islands Forum prioritized HIV/AIDS in its\r\npolitical communiqué of August 2002. In calling for\r\nadditional measures at the regional level, the Forum\r\nleaders directed the Forum secretariat to spearhead the\r\ndevelopment of a Pacific Regional Plan of Action\r\nAgainst HIV/AIDS. They also endorsed a concerted\r\nregional approach to accessing international financial\r\nassistance from sources such as the Global Fund to\r\nFight HIV/AIDS. On a broader scale, States within the\r\nAsia-Pacific region, particularly the more vulnerable\r\nsmall island States, have benefited from a more\r\nfocused subregional approach.\r\nOur regional efforts are hampered by\r\ncompounding difficulties, such as the lack of funding\r\nand technical capacity in our regional organizations to\r\nimplement these regional initiatives. Hence, there is an\r\nurgent need for international support and assistance in\r\nour collective struggle against the epidemic.\r\nA total of 91 countries have put in place national\r\nstrategies and established national AIDS councils, as\r\nwell as nationwide programmes and activities to\r\ncombat the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, other\r\ncountries, including certain worst affected countries,\r\nhave yet to establish such national instruments to\r\naddress the epidemic.\r\nMost of our members have in place appropriate\r\nnational HIV/AIDS policies, as well as legal,\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nadministrative and institutional mechanisms and\r\nprogrammes. The cross-sectoral involvement of all\r\nGovernment ministries, non-governmental\r\norganizations and private sector and other relevant\r\nstakeholders in the implementation of policies and\r\nprogrammes needs to be harnessed and better\r\ncoordinated. In our region, efforts to implement\r\npolicies and programmes are often impeded by lack of\r\nfinancial resources and technical expertise.\r\nGreater involvement of young people as\r\nsignificant agents for positive change in this\r\nchallenging area is being pursued in our region. We\r\nhave started to look at improving media tools and\r\nperspectives in the handling of HIV/AIDS. A recent\r\nbreakthrough in access to antiretroviral drugs in our\r\nregion needs financial backing for greater access. Most\r\nof our members have provided funding and technical\r\nassistance within our region.\r\nWe acknowledge the valuable financial\r\ncontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, including contributions by\r\nsome of our own Pacific Islands Forum members. The\r\nGlobal Fund has certainly assumed an important\r\nresponsibility in the provision of much-needed support\r\nand assistance to developing countries in their battle\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS. In particular, the Fund can assist in\r\nmobilizing resources from the private sector, which is\r\nvery important if the $10 billion annual requirement\r\nfrom all sources to fight HIV/AIDS is to be achieved.\r\nThe Fund’s targeted disbursements of $3 billion next\r\nyear represent a 50 per cent increase over the amount\r\navailable last year. We are, therefore, confident that\r\nresources will continue to be mobilized and positive\r\nimpacts will continue flowing from its allocation to\r\nlow and middle-income countries. Our group reiterates\r\nthat a small fraction of the $3 billion figure would\r\nmore than arrest the rate of infection in our small\r\nisland populations. We need to be assisted in this\r\nventure to reach a very positive outcome, which is\r\npossible in the Pacific region.\r\nThe achievement of our common objectives in\r\nsuch areas as prevention, care, treatment, reducing\r\nvulnerability, assistance to children orphaned by AIDS,\r\nalleviating social and economic impact and research\r\nand development are contingent on the availability of\r\nadequate resources at the disposal of developing\r\ncountries. The small populations and unique\r\nvulnerabilities that our small island developing\r\nmember States face have prioritized prevention\r\nstrategies in national action plans. In this connection,\r\nthe report favours our strategy in highlighting the\r\nsignificance of prevention, where it describes the\r\nsustained rate of infection in high-income countries,\r\ndespite all their advantages of access to care.\r\nWe would be remiss if we did not note the\r\ninvolvement of important partners in galvanizing our\r\ncollective efforts. We commend the leadership\r\nprovided by the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS and the work of its member agencies or co-\r\nsponsors system-wide. We appreciate their efforts to\r\nwork collaboratively with national and regional civil\r\nsociety organizations, non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) and private sector bodies to fight HIV/AIDS in\r\ntheir programme areas and activities.\r\nIn conclusion, these international achievements,\r\nincluding the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nHIV/AIDS, United Nations system-wide collaboration\r\nand partnership with the World Bank, NGOs, civil\r\nsociety, and other stakeholders, must be sustained if we\r\nare to meet our common objective to reduce by 2005\r\nHIV prevalence among young men and women, aged\r\n15 to 24, in the most affected 25 per cent of the\r\npopulation, and 25 per cent globally by 2010.\r\nFor developing countries, resourcing needs\r\nconstrain the ability to make progress in the battle\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS. Recognizing these special needs,\r\nwe encourage the international community to provide\r\nfinancial and technical assistance to developing\r\ncountries, such as the Pacific Island countries, to\r\nenable them to pursue both regional and national\r\ninitiatives in the battle against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): The subject of HIV/AIDS\r\nis of great importance and concern to Guyana. Being\r\npart of the Caribbean region, which has the second\r\nhighest incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in the world,\r\nand faced with a very serious problem in our own\r\ncountry, we are pledged to exerting every effort at all\r\nlevels — nationally, regionally and internationally —\r\nto rid the world of this scourge. It is against this\r\nbackground that I am honoured to set out the views of\r\nmy Government at this stage on the item before us. In\r\nso doing, I wish to express my appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the presentation of a clear and\r\nthoughtful report on progress towards implementation\r\nof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS,\r\nwhich is contained in document A/57/227.\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General presents a\r\nmixed picture of the progress made since the\r\nDeclaration was adopted in June 2001. On an\r\nencouraging note, the report points to signals of\r\nincreasing political commitment, as well as additional\r\nresources, devoted to combating HIV/AIDS. On the\r\nother hand, it makes clear that the global response has\r\nso far been insufficient to meet the challenge of\r\nsuccessfully halting and reversing the spread of this\r\npandemic. The Secretary-General thus makes an urgent\r\ncall for the scaling up of global efforts to halt the\r\nadvance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, a call that my\r\ndelegation wholeheartedly supports.\r\nOf particular concern to us in Guyana is the fact\r\nthat the infection rate is highest among those who are\r\n15-49 years of age. In addition to its heavy human toll,\r\nthe disease constitutes a serious threat to the productive\r\nsector of our population, as well as to our efforts to\r\npromote economic and social development. For these\r\nreasons, my Government has redoubled its efforts, with\r\nthe help of the international community, including\r\nsisterly developing countries, and agencies such as the\r\nUnited States Agency for International Development\r\nand the Canadian International Development Agency,\r\nto combat the spread of this dreaded disease in Guyana.\r\nSince the convening of the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly’s special session on HIV/AIDS last\r\nyear, significant progress has been made at the national\r\nlevel. HIV/AIDS has been incorporated into Guyana’s\r\nPoverty Reduction Strategy, and our 2002 allocation to\r\naddress this pandemic has more than doubled,\r\ncompared to the allocations made in 2001; this was\r\nfacilitated in part by debt relief received under the\r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt\r\nInitiative. In addition, earlier this year, my country\r\nconducted a response analysis of its HIV/AIDS\r\nprogramme, which led to the development of a\r\nMultisectoral Strategic Plan for 2002 to 2006,\r\nreplacing a previous Strategic Plan that covered the\r\nperiod of 1999 to 2001.\r\nGuyana’s Multisectoral Strategic Plan emphasizes\r\na three-pronged approach to halt and reverse the spread\r\nof HIV/AIDS and focuses on prevention, treatment and\r\ncare and other forms of support for the victims of this\r\ntragedy. In collaboration with various partners of the\r\nUnited Nations Theme Group operating locally, the\r\npeer education and youth-specific HIV education\r\nprogrammes have been expanded, and culturally\r\nappropriate messages have been developed and are\r\nbeing delivered at popular youth events. Time-bound\r\ntargets for reducing the prevalence of HIV among\r\nyoung people aged 15 to 24 have also been\r\nincorporated into the national strategic plan as a means\r\nof evaluating progress. The prevention strategy further\r\ntakes into consideration mother-to-child transmission.\r\nOn 21 November 2001, a pilot programme was\r\ninitiated that offers voluntary counselling and testing\r\nservices, as well as mother-to-child transmission care,\r\nto all prenatal women attending the pilot sites. Mothers\r\nare counselled about their breast-feeding options, and\r\ninfants born to mothers who choose not to breast feed\r\nare provided with free breast-milk substitutes. In health\r\ncare settings precautions have been strengthened with\r\nthe provision of post-exposure prophylaxis with\r\nantiretroviral drugs to health care workers in all\r\nregions of the country.\r\nA very significant development in the combat of\r\nHIV/AIDS in Guyana was the commencement in\r\nMarch of this year of the manufacture of antiretroviral\r\ndrugs and the accompanying treatment programme.\r\nUnder that programme, access to antiretroviral drugs is\r\nnow universal and provided free of cost. Furthermore,\r\nvoluntary and confidential counselling services, as well\r\nas testing facilities, have been expanded, with the\r\nincreasing partnership of non-governmental\r\norganizations.\r\nNotwithstanding the substantial efforts being\r\nmade at the national level to combat the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS, much more remains to be done, especially\r\nwith regard to efforts to foster change in sexual\r\nbehaviour and to bring an end to the stigmatization and\r\ndiscrimination of infected individuals. In addition,\r\nprogrammes will also have to be developed locally\r\nwith regard to the care of children orphaned by the\r\ndisease.\r\nOur efforts at the national level have been\r\ncomplemented by regional initiatives such as the Pan-\r\nCaribbean Partnership, which is a collaborative effort\r\nof the member States of the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\r\nThrough that mechanism, CARICOM as a region\r\nearlier this year successfully negotiated with\r\npharmaceutical companies for cheaper antiretroviral\r\ndrugs, in an effort to accelerate access to treatment and\r\ncare. Although the cost of these drugs has been\r\nsignificantly reduced, to approximately $1,200 per\r\nperson per year, it is still too expensive a form of\r\ntreatment that is beyond the capability of many of our\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nmember States. In addition, national AIDS programme\r\nmanagers and coordinators in the region have also\r\naligned themselves into the Caribbean Coalition of\r\nNational AIDS Programme Coordinators, which serves\r\nas a useful forum for exchange of experiences and the\r\ndevelopment of best practices within the region.\r\nDuring the General Assembly special session,\r\nheld last June, my delegation clearly articulated how\r\nnational efforts to combat the spread of AIDS could be\r\nstymied by a lack of resources. We underscored the\r\ngrave threat that would be faced by countries if urgent\r\naction were not taken to significantly increase the\r\nlevels of investment in the care, treatment and\r\nprevention of this disease. We remain convinced that\r\nfurther concerted action in the following areas is\r\nessential to provide new impetus and impact to action\r\nat the national level.\r\nFirst, there must be increased collaboration\r\nbetween international development agencies and\r\ninternational financial institutions, with a view to the\r\nprovision of further debt relief to heavily indebted\r\ncountries in order that more resources can be made\r\navailable to strengthen national health care systems and\r\naddress the current crisis.\r\nSecondly, relevant United Nations agencies\r\nshould intensify their efforts, working with Member\r\nStates, to support the development of national\r\nstrategies aimed at halting and reversing the spread of\r\nAIDS.\r\nThirdly, greater efforts are needed at both the\r\nglobal and the national levels to ensure that\r\nantiretroviral drugs are made more accessible to\r\npersons in developing countries.\r\nFourthly, we urge countries in a position to do so\r\nto increase their contributions to the Global Fund in\r\norder to facilitate its work in the areas of HIV/ AIDS,\r\ntuberculosis and malaria. While it has been estimated\r\nthat some $10 billion is required annually to combat\r\nthe spread of this disease, we note that, to date, the\r\nresources of the Fund amount to little more than 20 per\r\ncent of what is required.\r\nIn conclusion, I would wish to underscore the fact\r\nthat my Government continues to face great challenges\r\nin its effort to combat the spread of AIDS in Guyana.\r\nAt the same time, I am honoured to reiterate our\r\ncommitment to actively collaborate with other Member\r\nStates and the international community at large in\r\nefforts to halt the spread of this global scourge. We\r\nfirmly believe that our collective response to the\r\npandemic must be commensurate with the global\r\nrecognition that HIV/AIDS is the single greatest threat\r\nto the well-being of future generations.\r\nMr. Acemah (Uganda): My delegation welcomes\r\nthis opportunity to hold discussions on HIV/AIDS.\r\nThis confirms the commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to update itself on how far we have come,\r\nbut, more importantly, on how far we have to go. We\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his leadership in this\r\nregard, and for his report on progress towards the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS (A/57/227).\r\nMuch as Uganda has dealt with the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic for approximately 20 years, my delegation\r\nviews this plenary meeting as an opportunity to listen\r\nto others and to learn from them regarding what we\r\nmay not have done to combat the pandemic. The\r\nGovernment of Uganda has achieved remarkable\r\nsuccess in efforts to grapple with this problem, but I\r\nwould not underestimate the fact that a lot remains to\r\nbe done.\r\nOver 1 million Ugandans are infected with\r\nHIV/AIDS and approximately the same number have\r\ndied as a result of the disease, children continue to be\r\nborn with HIV and there are many orphans whose\r\nparents have died of AIDS. Today almost 2 million\r\nchildren in Uganda have been orphaned, and many of\r\nthose orphans are infected with the disease.\r\nThe pandemic has had a devastating impact on\r\nour medical facilities, economy and social structures,\r\nespecially the family, thus presenting a major security\r\nthreat. The dynamics of society have changed to a large\r\nextent due to the fact that a large number of the\r\nproductive segment of the population have been\r\ninfected or affected by HIV/AIDS. The situation I have\r\ndescribed has not left Ugandans in despair. People\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS in Uganda have become an\r\neffective weapon against the pandemic. The Ugandan\r\nNetwork and Association of People Living With\r\nHIV/AIDS has mounted effective advocacy and\r\nawareness-raising campaigns.\r\nUgandans living with HIV/AIDS are cooperating\r\nwith people living with HIV/AIDS in other countries of\r\nthe world to share experiences. We hope that this and\r\nother partnerships worldwide will gain momentum into\r\na global campaign to fight the pandemic. Very soon in\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nUganda there will be a convergence of great minds\r\nfrom different parts of the world to take on the\r\nproblem. Those great minds will include people living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS. Public debate about the pandemic is\r\nan effective mechanism for sensitizing the masses\r\nwhile at the same time seeking solutions.\r\nHIV/AIDS remains a complex problem with no\r\nknown cure. Uganda recognizes that it is a\r\nmultidimensional problem that requires a multisectoral\r\napproach. Uganda has made the few successes for\r\nwhich it is recognized by harnessing the few\r\nopportunities available to its people. With limited\r\nscientific information available, fear, panic, denial,\r\nstigma and discrimination were prevalent in the past.\r\nHowever, owing to the political will and leadership on\r\nthe part of the President of Uganda, acceptance is\r\nbecoming the norm and the rate of infection has been\r\nsignificantly reduced.\r\nOpenness, political support and commitment have\r\nbeen key to reducing the number of HIV/AIDS cases,\r\nsince the youth are being educated about the problem.\r\nThe President of Uganda has instituted a mechanism\r\nthrough which he is frequently briefed on the education\r\nin schools regarding HIV/AIDS. Local leaders have\r\nfollowed the example of the President by addressing\r\ngrass-roots communities. Awareness levels have risen\r\nto 99.7 per cent and knowledge is at 78 per cent of the\r\npopulation.\r\nHIV/AIDS issues are part and parcel of Uganda’s\r\nnational programmes including education, the Poverty\r\nEradication Action Plan and debt relief. Resources\r\nfrom debt relief have been channelled to AIDS\r\nactivities, as well as the empowerment of women and\r\ngirls, health care and law reform measures. Also\r\nimportant to the Government is cooperation with the\r\nprivate sector, the business community and civil\r\nsociety. The Uganda AIDS Commission is\r\nspearheading coordination of multisectoral efforts to\r\nreview progress, identify gaps and set national\r\npriorities and strategies to ensure timely delivery and\r\ncoverage of prevention and care services.\r\nUganda needs grants and other support measures\r\nto help us intensify our response. We welcome\r\nassistance from the international community in that\r\nregard.\r\nEven with openness, political leadership,\r\nsensitization and education, there remains the fact that\r\na large number of people need effective medication to\r\nmitigate their suffering and to help curb opportunistic\r\ninfections like malaria, pneumonia, tuberculosis and\r\nothers. Counselling has to be made available to all who\r\nhave experienced trauma, distress, stress and\r\ndepression.\r\nUganda’s Ministry of Health is engaging in the\r\nprovision of antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother-to-\r\nchild HIV/AIDS transmission. Programmes and\r\nactivities have been developed and implemented in\r\nareas of voluntary counselling, testing and blood\r\nsafety. Pharmaceutical companies have, therefore, a\r\nmajor role to play in that regard. These companies are\r\nalready providing some assistance, which we highly\r\nappreciated. The Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations, the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Refugees and many other\r\norganizations should be commended for their efforts as\r\nwell. We appeal to the international community, in\r\nparticular the donor community, to contribute\r\ngenerously to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. The support of development\r\npartners in planning and resource mobilization and in\r\nproviding guidance is crucial in that regard.\r\nUganda believes that we must all work together\r\nuntil we achieve zero prevalence and develop a vaccine\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS. The International AIDS Vaccine\r\nInitiative is already working toward that goal.\r\nBehaviour has to change. Health and education,\r\ntargeting the girl-child in particular, standards and\r\ndelivery systems must be strengthened. Services should\r\nreach the masses through decentralization. Poverty\r\nmust be reduced, especially through debt cancellation\r\nand agricultural modernization, and employment\r\nopportunities must be provided, especially for women.\r\nIn closing, Uganda concurs with the\r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General in his\r\nreport, and we support the proposal to devote at least\r\none full day to discuss problems related to HIV/AIDS\r\nduring the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): My delegation is pleased to\r\nsee you, Sir, presiding over the Assembly, especially at\r\na time when we are discussing a topic that is so\r\nimportant to people the world over. I also wish to\r\nexpress my appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report on progress towards the\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS. The report attempts to evaluate how far the\r\nworld community has come in its fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS since the Declaration was adopted by\r\nMember States at the special session of the General\r\nAssembly in June last year. My delegation wishes to\r\nassociate itself with the statement made by the\r\nrepresentative of Brunei Darussalam on behalf of\r\nmembers of the Association of the South-East Asian\r\nNations.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has been with us for the\r\npast two decades. It has caused untold suffering to the\r\nworld community, and its toll is rising. In his address\r\nto the twenty-sixth special session of the General\r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS, the Secretary-General had\r\nmentioned that almost 22 million people have died of\r\nAIDS worldwide and that 13 million children have\r\nbeen orphaned. Again, in his World AIDS Day message\r\nof 1 December 2001, the Secretary-General mentioned\r\nthat, every hour of every day, almost 600 people are\r\ninfected and that 60 children die of the virus every\r\nhour. In this year’s report, the Secretary-General\r\nmentions that, unless there is a scaled-up effort of the\r\nglobal community, 45 million new infections are\r\nprojected to occur between 2002 and 2010. The special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS brought\r\ntogether Governments, civil society and the private\r\nsectors as never before to find common resolve to fight\r\nthis growing pandemic. We take heart that, following\r\nthe adoption of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, there is now a new collective level of\r\ncommitment.\r\nTo combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, we need to\r\ntake effective action at the international, regional and\r\nnational levels. May I apprise this Assembly of\r\nMyanmar’s endeavours to meet the time-bound\r\ncommitments set out in the Declaration, highlighting\r\nnational leadership and regional collaboration,\r\nprevention by creating awareness, cooperation with\r\nUnited Nations agencies and the active role of non-\r\ngovernmental sectors in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn Myanmar, HIV/AIDS is designated a disease\r\nof national concern, together with malaria and\r\ntuberculosis. National leadership is provided by the\r\nNational Health Committee, under which the National\r\nAIDS Committee, chaired by the Minister for Health, is\r\nspearheading a programme in which all agencies of the\r\nMinistry of Health are actively engaged in HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention and control activities. Myanmar is made up\r\nof seven States and seven divisions, and each State and\r\ndivision has its own AIDS Committee, empowered by\r\nthe National AIDS Committee. To boost regional\r\ncollaboration, in November 2001 Myanmar joined the\r\nheads of Government of other countries of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations to pledge\r\njoint leadership in the fight against AIDS. Myanmar\r\nand its neighbours are also exchanging experiences\r\nthrough partnerships, such as the Mekong Partnership\r\nand Beyond.\r\nThe Secretary-General in his report mentions that\r\nyoung people can be effective HIV prevention\r\nmessengers, which is what we are doing in Myanmar.\r\nSchool-based Healthy HIV/AIDS Prevention\r\nEducation, also known as SHAPE, has brought\r\nlifeskills-based education on HIV/AIDS and sexually\r\ntransmitted infections (STI) to over 1.2 million\r\nMyanmar schoolchildren in over 9,000 schools.\r\nSHAPE’s “spiral curriculum” combines age-\r\nappropriate information about HIV/AIDS and healthy\r\nliving, with lifeskills and peer education components,\r\nfor children aged seven to fifteen. SHAPE is designed\r\nin such a way that children bring what they learn in\r\nschool to their families and to their communities\r\nthrough community activities. SHAPE has been\r\nintegrated into the national curriculum and\r\nimplementation is steadily growing towards the\r\nnationwide scale.\r\nA Myanmar-language publication by the name of\r\n“100 Frequently Asked Questions” has been published\r\nand widely distributed since December 1999 and is still\r\nin great demand. The book deals with the ABCs of HIV\r\nprevention and care and also tackles complex moral\r\nquestions. Since last year, sections of this publication\r\nhave been regularly published in English and\r\nMyanmar-language newspapers.\r\nTo further create awareness and reduce the stigma\r\nof HIV/AIDS, the Government also uses the most\r\npopular form of the media — the television — to reach\r\nthe masses through documentaries and films.\r\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) also\r\nplay an active role in HIV prevention and care.\r\nNational NGOs, such as the Myanmar Red Cross\r\nSociety, have been implementing a community-level\r\npeer-education project for youth since 1994 and a\r\nnotable national NGO, Myanmar Maternal and Child\r\nWelfare Association (MMCWA) also conducts very\r\nsuccessful lifeskills-based HIV/AIDS/STI training\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nprogrammes for women and youth. MMCWA also runs\r\nanother type of programme, aimed at women of\r\nreproductive age, which has gained popular acceptance.\r\nWe are appreciative of the support of the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for these activities\r\nin 19 townships.\r\nFollowing a joint UNICEF/United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund assessment of the need and feasibility\r\nof prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMCT)\r\ninterventions, 2001 saw the launch of two PMCT pilots\r\nprojects in areas of high maternal HIV incidence, one\r\nin Tachileik and the other in Kawthaung, both of which\r\nare in the border regions. An HIV/AIDS counselling\r\nmanual, with particular emphasis on the prevention of\r\nmother-to-child transmission, has also been adapted for\r\nMyanmar and the Government has designed a national\r\nstrategy, policies and guidelines on PMCT in close\r\ncollaboration with United Nations agencies.\r\nWe are combating the global menace of\r\nHIV/AIDS nationally as a topmost priority. We take the\r\nmatter very seriously. Despite that, there are those who\r\nwould resort to any device to vilify my country and\r\ndiscredit its achievements. Using a grossly inflated\r\nestimate of 500,000 people living with HIV/AIDS,\r\nthere have been frequent attempts to projecting\r\nMyanmar as a country which has done little to combat\r\nthis global menace. As the facts bear out, nothing could\r\nbe further from the truth. It is pertinent to note that the\r\nMinistry of Health and the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS in Geneva jointly held a\r\nworkshop in March 2002 on estimates of people living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS in my country. The outcome of the\r\nmeeting was an estimate of 177,279 people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS by the end of 2001. It was also concluded\r\nthat HIV infection in Myanmar was not generalized,\r\nbut more concentrated in high-risk groups.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General indicates an\r\nincrease in national investments in HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes. We are happy to see that political\r\ncommitment, regional collaboration, openness and\r\nengagement by non-governmental sectors have\r\nincreased worldwide. However, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has rightly pointed out, the implementation of\r\nnational AIDS strategies in most countries has been\r\nslow, in large measure owing to a lack of resources and\r\ntechnical capacity. In this regard, my delegation\r\nwelcomes the establishment of the Global Fund.\r\nMay I conclude by urging the international\r\ncommunity, particularly the developed countries, to\r\ncontinue to assist the developing countries in their fight\r\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic. It has cost too many\r\nlives and untold miseries. Of all human rights, the right\r\nto life is surely the most precious.\r\nMr. Davison (United States): Many strides have\r\nbeen made in the fight against HIV/AIDS since the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly’s special session on\r\nHIV/AIDS in June of 2001, and the United States is\r\nproud to be at the forefront of many of these efforts.\r\nBut much more remains to be done. The United States\r\nwill continue to work in partnership with other nations\r\nand civil society, including faith-based and community-\r\nbased organizations to continue the fight and make a\r\ndifference in the lives of those living with HIV and\r\nAIDS.\r\nThe most laudable achievement since the special\r\nsession was held is the rapid establishment of the\r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.\r\nAt the special session, it was still a vision to be\r\nfulfilled, as foreseen by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\r\nThe special session’s Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, in fact, referred to the need to ensure “that\r\nthe resources provided for the global response to\r\naddress HIV/AIDS are substantial, sustained and\r\ngeared towards achieving results”. (A/RES/S-26/2)\r\nThe Global Fund represents a new way of doing\r\nbusiness. It will soon be moving significant new\r\nresources to countries to help push back the impact of\r\nthese major diseases, and the United States is the single\r\nlargest contributor to the Fund.\r\nHowever, even with these new resources, a major\r\nchallenge remains. We must all understand that this\r\nnew additional and complementary support from the\r\nGlobal Fund, cannot displace already existing efforts.\r\nThe United States has provided leadership by pledging\r\nincreased resources to the Global Fund, while at the\r\nsame time increasing bilateral efforts. Other donors\r\nmust do the same. Expanded national, bilateral and\r\nmultilateral support is needed to make the Fund\r\nsuccessful. The resource gap will continue to be a\r\nchallenge and, as have many other States in this debate,\r\nwe urge that new resources from all types of donors be\r\ncontributed into the Fund and other HIV/AIDS-related\r\nefforts.\r\nThe United States continues to be the single\r\nlargest donor to international AIDS efforts, providing\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\n44 per cent of bilateral assistance for international\r\nHIV/AIDS efforts, according to UNAIDS. Its monies\r\nsupport bilateral and multilateral programmes that\r\nprevent new infections, reduce risky behaviour and\r\nprovide treatment and care for those living with HIV.\r\nThe United States is also the leader in the research\r\nnecessary to develop a vaccine.\r\nIn June, President George W. Bush announced a\r\nnew $500 million initiative to expand Unites States\r\nefforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission in 14\r\ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. The\r\ninitiative’s goal is to treat 1 million women and reduce\r\nmother-to-child transmission by 40 per cent within five\r\nyears. This programme will be in addition to already\r\nexisting United States HIV/AIDS assistance\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe United States, however, is doing more than\r\nsimply providing funding and carrying out research.\r\nThe Bush Administration has appointed the first United\r\nStates ambassador with a health mandate, Dr. Jack\r\nChow, who is Secretary of State Colin Powell’s special\r\nrepresentative on HIV/AIDS. We are actively pursuing\r\na diplomatic strategy involving Governments, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and the private sector.\r\nSecretary Powell and Secretary Thompson of Health\r\nand Human Services are working closely to lead United\r\nStates efforts to fight AIDS worldwide; the United\r\nStates Agency for International Development and the\r\nDepartment of Health and Human Services are more\r\nengaged than ever in addressing the global multifaceted\r\nimpact of HIV/AIDS.\r\nDespite these efforts, however, the decades to\r\ncome threaten to be far worse than those that have\r\nalready passed. The recent National Intelligence\r\nCouncil report on the next wave of the epidemic clearly\r\nindicates that as an international community we must\r\ntake action now if we are to slow the epidemic’s\r\nexponential growth.\r\nWe urge States that have not already done so to\r\nwork to meet the targets set by the General Assembly’s\r\ntwenty-sixth special session on HIV/AIDS. We look\r\nforward to a full review of progress on meeting the\r\ngoals of the special session at the General Assembly in\r\n2003. Despite increased education and public\r\nawareness, taboo and stigma remain formidable\r\nobstacles to effective responses. Political leadership\r\nfrom all of us is crucial in making a difference in\r\ncombating the stigma and discrimination that have\r\naccompanied the epidemic worldwide. Parents and\r\nfamilies are critical. Religious and community leaders\r\nmust be involved. Nations must work actively to\r\naddress gender and age-based dimensions of the\r\nepidemic, and to eliminate discrimination and\r\nmarginalization.\r\nThe United States believes that public-private\r\npartnerships are vital to combat HIV and AIDS. It is\r\nonly through the combination of public and private\r\nefforts that we will be able to confront the challenges\r\nahead. The United States will continue to offer\r\nfinancial and technical assistance to achieve these\r\ntargets.\r\nFinally, we must continue to heed the lessons\r\nlearned from the past two decades. We know that a\r\nbalanced and integrated approach, in a continuum that\r\nincludes prevention, treatment and care, is vital, as is a\r\nsolid commitment to sound public health infrastructure.\r\nThe United States is strongly committed to\r\ncontinuing its leadership and working with the\r\ninternational community to save lives by preventing\r\nnew infections of HIV, helping people already infected,\r\nand contributing to the search for a cure. We believe\r\nthat by working together we can, and will, make a\r\ndifference.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nMr. Shimmura (Japan): First of all, I would like\r\nto express my appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis strong leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS\r\nand for the extensive and informative report on the\r\nfollow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession. I also would like to commend the efforts made\r\nby UNAIDS and its sponsors in meeting the targets set\r\nout in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS.\r\nDr. Piot, the Executive Director of UNAIDS, told\r\nus that since the special session, progress has been\r\nmade in three key areas: leadership, partnership, and\r\nresources. This is a major achievement for the\r\ninternational community. Of these elements, we think\r\nthat leadership, at all levels in both the public and\r\nprivate sectors, is the most important in the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS.\r\nThere are on the other hand, worrying signs that\r\nthe epidemic, which spares no part of the world, is\r\ncontinuing to spread. The Asian region, for example, is\r\nexperiencing a rapid increase in HIV prevalence rates.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nBecause of its vast population, even a low prevalence\r\nin Asia means a large number of people infected and\r\naffected by HIV/AIDS. We must therefore strengthen\r\nour efforts to stop and reverse the spread of the\r\nepidemic in this region as soon as possible.\r\nThere are a number of practices that have proven\r\neffective, such as those being used in Thailand, which\r\ninclude prevention measures targeting vulnerable\r\npopulations, education programmes aimed at youth and\r\nsupport for activities by non-governmental\r\norganizations. It is important that those best practices\r\nbe utilized by other countries of the region. In this\r\ncontext, the Government of Japan announced last year\r\nthe establishment of the Japan-ASEAN Information\r\nand Human Network for Infectious Diseases Control to\r\nsupport human resources development in the area of\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nMy Government believes that, as the Declaration\r\nof Commitment on HIV/AIDS states, prevention must\r\nbe the mainstay of our response. But at the same time,\r\nwe think that care and support, to be provided through\r\nbasic health infrastructure, are closely linked to\r\neffective prevention. Provision of care and support in\r\naccordance with local conditions, including voluntary\r\nand confidential testing, must be promoted as an\r\neffective tool to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS.\r\nThere has been a notable decline in the prices of\r\nantiretroviral drugs since last year, and that has\r\ncontributed to the improvement of access to treatment\r\nin developing countries. We appreciate the efforts made\r\nby the United Nations in this regard. We believe in\r\ncomprehensive care and treatment for those infected by\r\nHIV/AIDS, including treatment of opportunistic\r\ninfections such as tuberculosis. What is needed is\r\ncontinuous patient education, psychological and social\r\nsupport from their families and communities and a\r\nsound health infrastructure.\r\nAt the G-8 Kyushu-Okinawa Summit in 2000,\r\nJapan announced the Okinawa Infectious Diseases\r\nInitiative, a $3 billion programme to enhance support\r\nfor combating HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases\r\nin developing countries. It has five elements: vertical\r\nand horizontal approaches, including improvement of\r\nwater and sanitation and basic education; partnerships\r\nwith civil society, donors and international\r\norganizations; institution-building and human\r\nresources development; South-South cooperation; and\r\nresearch capacity and activities. To date, my\r\nGovernment has provided assistance of approximately\r\n$1 billion under this initiative.\r\nWe welcome the establishment in January this\r\nyear of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis\r\nand Malaria, which was proposed at the special session\r\non HIV/AIDS and at the G-8 Genoa Summit last June.\r\nJapan is making a contribution of $200 million to the\r\nFund in the hope that it will strengthen global measures\r\nto combat infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS. My\r\nGovernment, as vice-chair of the Board of the Fund, is\r\ncommitted to working to enable the Fund to provide\r\nthe maximum possible support for infectious disease\r\ncontrol measures in developing countries.\r\nMr. Kasemsarn (Thailand): HIV/AIDS is a\r\nglobal problem. Indeed, it remains a major\r\ntransnational threat that the international community\r\nhas a shared responsibility to deal with urgently and\r\nresolutely.\r\nIt is a welcome sign that HIV/AIDS has truly\r\nbeen made a part of the international agenda. As stated\r\nin the report of the Secretary-General on progress\r\ntowards implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS since the twenty-sixth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly in June last\r\nyear, the international community has passed a turning\r\npoint in its global response to HIV/AIDS. Global\r\nawareness of this scourge has been growing, and\r\nresources allocated to tackle it have been on the rise,\r\nboth nationally and internationally. The establishment\r\nof the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria is a significant step in this regard. Thailand\r\nappreciates the role of the United Nations, particularly\r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS), in the progress made so far, as well as the\r\npersonal attention of the Secretary-General in making\r\nHIV/AIDS a priority of the United Nations.\r\nHowever, it is equally true that the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic continues to get worse, including in Asia,\r\nwhere the epidemic continues to spread. Hence, much\r\nmore needs to be done without delay if we are to save\r\nthe millions of lives that will perish due to this\r\nepidemic and the millions more that will become\r\ninfected and affected by it. Also, many more resources\r\nare required to meet the needs particularly of\r\ndeveloping countries, which are home to more than 95\r\nper cent of the more than 60 million people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS worldwide. More research must be carried\r\nout to find effective cures and vaccines.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nA report appearing in The New York Times this\r\nmorning is encouraging. It said that yesterday the Food\r\nand Drug Administration approved a test that can\r\ndetect in as little as 20 minutes whether someone is\r\ninfected with HIV. Standard tests currently take two\r\ndays to two weeks.\r\nThe political momentum must be translated into\r\nconcrete action. An effective response to HIV/AIDS\r\nrequires a concerted and comprehensive approach in\r\naddressing the various aspects of the epidemic:\r\nprevention, care, treatment and support, research and\r\ndevelopment and strategies to address the specific\r\nsituations of vulnerable groups and the human rights of\r\npeople with HIV/AIDS. Also essential are strong\r\nleadership at all levels and the full and active\r\ninvolvement of all sectors of society.\r\nIn Thailand’s experience, much of our success in\r\ncurbing the trend of HIV/AIDS is due to the\r\ncontribution of civil society, non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs) and, not least, United Nations\r\nagencies, particularly UNAIDS and its co-sponsors.\r\nIndeed, national ownership and partnerships are\r\nindispensable elements in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\r\nHIV/AIDS must be made a part of the national agenda\r\nand be integrated as a cross-cutting issue into our\r\nefforts aiming at achieving sustainable development.\r\nThailand’s national plans for the prevention and\r\nalleviation of HIV/AIDS have been developed and\r\nimplemented in this spirit. The current plan, which\r\ncovers the period between 2002 and 2006, also adopts a\r\nhuman-centred approach and emphasizes building the\r\ncapacity of individuals, families, communities and the\r\nadministrative system to deal with HIV/AIDS. Efforts\r\nundertaken at the national, provincial, district and\r\ncommunity levels by Government agencies, NGOs,\r\nincluding the organizations of people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS, and the private sector are implemented\r\nunder the auspices of the national AIDS prevention and\r\nalleviation committee. The major networks of NGOs\r\nworking on AIDS and of organizations of people living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS are also represented in that national\r\ncommittee.\r\nIn terms of policy and implementation,\r\nprevention remains the mainstay of our response to roll\r\nback HIV/AIDS. The Thai Government has set the\r\ntarget of reducing the rate of HIV/AIDS prevalence\r\namong people of reproductive age — between the ages\r\nof 15 and 49 — to less than 1 per cent by 2006. Young\r\npeople are the main target group in our prevention\r\nefforts, which include not only awareness-raising\r\ncampaigns but also sexual and reproductive health\r\neducation and voluntary counselling and testing. We\r\nalso strive to promote access to HIV prevention among\r\nhard-to-reach groups, including injecting drug users\r\nand migrant workers. The programme promoting 100\r\nper cent condom use — which began in 1989 and\r\nresulted in a substantial reduction of HIV transmission\r\namong the high-risk population — has continued, and\r\nits focus has expanded beyond commercial sex\r\nworkers. At the same time, we continue to pursue the\r\nnationwide intervention against mother-to-child\r\ntransmission.\r\nWith regard to care, support and treatment, the\r\nGovernment continues to promote broader access to\r\ntreatment. Already, treatment of common opportunistic\r\ninfections, such as tuberculosis and pneumonia, is\r\ncovered under the national universal health coverage\r\nprogramme. By 2004, we aim to integrate antiretroviral\r\ntreatment into the programme. Monitoring and\r\nevaluation mechanisms will also be developed to\r\nensure the programme’s effectiveness. In addition, we\r\npromote continuing support and training for health\r\nprofessionals and caregivers in all sectors — including\r\nnon-governmental organizations — and for community\r\nvolunteers, as well as for people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nHowever, efforts to provide access to affordable\r\ntreatment for those in need also require support from\r\nthe international community. In that regard, Thailand\r\nhopes that the agreement reached by the World Trade\r\nOrganization Ministerial Conference on intellectual\r\nproperty rights and public health, held at Doha last\r\nyear, will be implemented to benefit people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS, particularly those in developing countries.\r\nThe human rights of those living with HIV/AIDS\r\nmust be respected and promoted to ensure that they live\r\ntheir lives as do other members of society. It is\r\nimportant that we address seriously the problem of\r\nAIDS-related stigma and social exclusion. Thailand’s\r\npolicy in that regard emphasizes awareness-raising\r\namong families and communities and provides support\r\nfor organizations dealing with HIV/AIDS issues,\r\nincluding community activities that involve people\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS. The rights of people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS have also been incorporated into the policy\r\nand the work of the National Human Rights\r\nCommission.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nHIV/AIDS undermines economic and social\r\ndevelopment. It threatens security, and, if left to spread\r\nunabated, it can even jeopardize the survival of\r\nsocieties. The enormity and the multidimensional\r\ncharacter of HIV/AIDS require concerted actions by\r\nthe international community. Cooperation is not only\r\ndesirable, but also imperative. In that regard, Thailand\r\nhas been collaborating with its neighbours and friends\r\nin and outside the region in the subregional, regional\r\nand international contexts. In November 2001,\r\nThailand, together with other member countries of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN),\r\npledged at the highest level our resolve to fight\r\nHIV/AIDS. Last January, Thailand also hosted the\r\nIntersessional Meeting of the Human Security Network\r\non Human Security and HIV/AIDS, focusing on\r\ncooperation aimed at tackling HIV/AIDS in the\r\nMekong subregion. Moreover, we are honoured to play\r\nhost to the Fifteenth International AIDS Conference,\r\nwhich will be held in July 2004. We stand ready to\r\ncooperate with all concerned to ensure productive\r\ndeliberations and a fruitful Conference outcome.\r\nThe international community, with common\r\nresolve, set noble goals during the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession of the General Assembly. As the first set of\r\nthose targets will be due next year, the Assembly’s\r\ndebate on this agenda item will be a particularly\r\nimportant platform for reviewing the progress we have\r\nmade and for setting our future course of action. It is\r\nThailand’s fervent hope that, by then, we shall all have\r\nmoved much closer, with ever stronger commitment\r\nand perseverance, to attaining our common objective of\r\nputting an end to the tragedy of HIV/AIDS that faces\r\nhumanity.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar)\r\n(spoke in French): It is a pleasure for me to take the\r\nfloor here today and, like previous speakers, to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ncomprehensive and very detailed report on progress\r\ntowards implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (A/57/227 and Corr.1). I\r\nalso wish to thank all the organs and specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations system and the entities\r\nof the private sector and of civil society, as well as\r\nnon-governmental organizations, for their efforts to\r\nfight HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe special session of the General Assembly\r\ndevoted to HIV/AIDS, held in 2001, enabled the\r\ninternational community to assess the worldwide\r\nspread of the AIDS pandemic, considered the greatest\r\nthreat to humanity. The Assembly realized that it was\r\nessential, in focusing seriously on issues related to\r\nAIDS, to see its catastrophic effects on all aspects of\r\nsocial and economic life. The Declaration of\r\nCommitment, adopted by States at the special session,\r\nreflects global concern and the resolve of nations to act\r\nto combat this terrible scourge.\r\nWe must recall that, every day, nearly 14,000\r\nchildren are infected by AIDS and that 1.2 per cent of\r\npersons aged 15 to 49 are living with AIDS. In the light\r\nof the extent of the HIV/AIDS pandemic — which has\r\nalready taken too heavy a toll on Africa and the rest of\r\nthe world — the efforts undertaken thus far are proving\r\ninsufficient. In fact, while most countries have already\r\nformulated national strategies to fight AIDS, the\r\nimplementation of the recommended measures\r\ncontinues to be limited by a lack of resources and\r\ntechnical means. Poverty, worsened by the debt burden,\r\nprevents States — in particular developing countries —\r\nfrom giving priority to combating AIDS in their\r\ndevelopment programmes, while the infection rate\r\namong young people and women continues to increase.\r\nMany factors should be taken into consideration\r\nto make the fight against AIDS effective. In that\r\nconnection, there must be a more organized data\r\ncollection system capable of classifying data by\r\ncategory, based on cause of infection, and thus of\r\ndetermining means of prevention. We must also\r\ndevelop research into new approaches towards fighting\r\nstigmatization, discrimination and exclusion with\r\nregard to persons living with AIDS in order to reduce\r\ntheir vulnerability, especially among women. Such\r\npersons can play an essential role in the fight against\r\nAIDS in terms of information and awareness, and they\r\ncan contribute to the formulation of strategies to\r\nprevent and treat the disease. In that context, we\r\nconsider it urgent to strengthen the fight against drug\r\nabuse among young people and to effectively\r\nimplement international instruments related to the\r\nrights of children, with a view to protecting them from\r\nsexual exploitation, paedophilia, rape and all other\r\ncrimes of that nature.\r\nMadagascar welcomes the decision taken by most\r\ncountries to increase their budgets to finance anti-\r\nAIDS programmes, whether at national, bilateral,\r\nmultilateral or private levels. We particularly welcome\r\nthe creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. However, my delegation\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\ncannot fail to express its concern over the amount\r\nraised to date — $2 billion, which is not even a third of\r\nthe budgetary objective of approximately $10 billion\r\nby the year 2005. In that connection, despite many\r\nchallenges, Madagascar will spare no effort to honour,\r\nwithin the means at its disposal, its share of the\r\ncontributions to the Global Fund. We take this\r\nopportunity to appeal to all donors and assistance\r\nproviders to increase their contributions, since AIDS is\r\na global problem.\r\nMoreover, Madagascar considers it urgent to\r\ncancel the debt of the highly indebted poor countries so\r\nthat they can increase their commitment to the fight\r\nagainst AIDS. It would also be good to advocate\r\nfinancial participation on the part of the international\r\ncommunity not in the form of loans but as grants\r\ntoward the countries most affected by AIDS, and in\r\nparticular countries of Africa and Asia. It is regrettable\r\nto note that on these two continents only 60,000\r\npersons are receiving antiretroviral drugs. Madagascar\r\nbelieves that it is of the highest importance to step up\r\nand accelerate negotiations with private pharmaceutical\r\ncompanies so that those medicines can be more\r\naccessible to the sick in low-income countries.\r\nAware of the devastating effects of the AIDS\r\npandemic on its socio-economic development and its\r\nsecurity, Africa has made a resolute commitment to\r\nwaging war against this scourge on all fronts. All\r\nAfrican countries have, therefore, elaborated national\r\nstrategies to fight AIDS and a greater number of\r\ninitiatives to fight AIDS have proliferated at the\r\nregional and subregional levels, pursuant to the\r\npurposes and objectives of the Abuja Declaration on\r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and other Related Infectious\r\nDiseases.\r\nMadagascar hopes that initiatives taken by\r\nAfrican leaders in the framework of the New Economic\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development to develop\r\npartnerships at the global level to effectively fight\r\nagainst pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria\r\nand tuberculosis, will enjoy the firm support of the\r\ninternational community in order to attain the\r\ninternational human development objectives.\r\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\r\nat Johannesburg recognized the impact of AIDS-\r\nweakened performance in the economic and social\r\nareas at the international level as well as in society,\r\nfamilies and individuals. It also highlighted the\r\nstruggle against AIDS and recommended concentrating\r\nefforts on the population in order to achieve sound\r\ndevelopment of human resources. My delegation\r\nbelieves that there is a need to expand the areas of\r\nintervention, in particular with regard to prevention,\r\nand that the fight against AIDS should not be solely the\r\nresponsibility of Ministries of Health but should\r\ninvolve all in all sectors.\r\nConvinced as we are that the joint response\r\nagainst AIDS requires coordinated action in the\r\nframework of solid partnerships, Madagascar intends to\r\nparticipate in this crusade as a member of the\r\npartnership against AIDS in the Indian Ocean region,\r\nestablished early in 2002.\r\nAt the national level, after detecting the first\r\nAIDS case in Madagascar in 1987, the Government\r\nestablished bodies for the elaboration and\r\nimplementation of three short- and medium-term plans.\r\nThe national committee to fight HIV/AIDS under the\r\naegis of the President was established by decree in\r\nOctober 2002 and it replaces the old national\r\ncoordination unit. The severity and complexity of the\r\nAIDS epidemic, the many sectors and actors involved,\r\nthe present Government policy of granting autonomy to\r\nthe provinces and the need to expand the national\r\nresponse to the AIDS epidemic all provide justification\r\nfor updating the institutional framework and adapting it\r\nto the requirements of the many sectors involved and\r\ndecentralization on the basis of lessons learned. The\r\ncoordination offered by the national coordination office\r\nhas been replaced by the executive secretariat of the\r\nnational committee to fight AIDS.\r\nThe political legal framework and the particular\r\ncase of persons living with AIDS and AIDS orphans\r\nshould strengthen the fight against this disease. The\r\nmanagement of information and financial resources are\r\ntwo pillars of this institutional framework. The\r\nGovernment of Madagascar has also undertaken to\r\nestablish a more reliable system of information\r\ncovering circulation and conservation and to determine\r\nwhat kind of financing mechanisms can ensure the\r\navailability of resources at the local level and the\r\ninvolvement of the beneficiaries in managing those\r\nresources.\r\nIn its efforts, the Government is prepared to\r\nmobilize and take the necessary measures to ensure\r\nthat persons living with HIV receive psychosocial\r\nservices.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nIn order to have effective decentralization in this\r\nbattle, provincial AIDS committees will be set up in\r\nthe autonomous provinces to ensure supervision and\r\ncoordination of the national strategic plan in all\r\nimplementing agencies so as to ensure integrated\r\nplanning and budgeting of the activities to fight AIDS\r\nat the provincial level and to ensure the reporting of\r\ndata to the executive secretariat. Similar local\r\ncommittees will be established at the community level.\r\nIn conclusion, the meagre results obtained since\r\nthe Declaration call for increased mobilization by the\r\ninternational community to stem the alarming spread of\r\nAIDS. AIDS is an enemy to be feared, but it is not\r\ninvincible if we devote all of our energies and make\r\nAIDS a priority on an equal footing with the\r\nmaintenance of peace and security.\r\nMr. Oratmangun (Indonesia): At the outset let\r\nme thank the Secretary-General for his timely report on\r\nthis very important subject. My delegation associates\r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of\r\nBrunei Darussalam on behalf of the ASEAN countries.\r\nAccording to the United Nations AIDS report\r\nissued in July 2002, 40 million people across the globe\r\nare now infected with the HIV virus, while 25 million\r\nhave already died. If left unchecked, the rate of\r\ninfection will increase, with 45 million new infections\r\nbefore the end of the decade. AIDS has already\r\ndevastated large parts of Africa; 11 million of the 14\r\nmillion AIDS orphans in the world are located in\r\nAfrica.\r\nIn addition, the data shows that one of the regions\r\nthat is experiencing the most rapid growth in new\r\nHIV/AIDS infections is Asia. If HIV/AIDS infection\r\nrates in Asia are allowed to reach the levels of sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, the number of infected individuals\r\nworldwide would number over 100 million people.\r\nThere are many who feel that in the absence of\r\nconcerted and sustained global efforts to halt and\r\nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, the grim figures I\r\nhave quoted are in fact optimistic, and the massive\r\ngrowth of the HIV/AIDS pandemic will begin to pose a\r\nserious threat to the world economy, and global peace\r\nand security.\r\nOn the bright side, the adoption of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment at the United Nations\r\nGeneral Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS in\r\nJune 2001 provides a new momentum for the\r\ninternational community to combat this devastating\r\nepidemic. It marks a turning point in the struggle\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS by setting time-bound targets to\r\nprevent and treat this disease. There is hope if we take\r\naction. It is estimated that 63 per cent of the new\r\ninfections predicted between now and 2010 can be\r\nprevented.\r\nToday’s session is also of momentous importance,\r\nsince we will deliberate what follow up actions are\r\nnecessary to implement last year’s Declaration of\r\nCommitment. Indonesia is encouraged by the fact that\r\nso many countries have already implemented national\r\nAIDS strategies, but Indonesia also notes with concern\r\nthat the implementation of those strategies, especially\r\nin the low- and middle-income countries, is in jeopardy\r\nowing to a lack of resources and technical capacity. In\r\norder to mount an effective global response to the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic there must be concrete political\r\ncommitment, genuine cooperation and concerted action\r\nby all, at all levels and across all sectors. A\r\nprerequisite, if the international community wishes to\r\neliminate this global curse, is strong leadership that\r\nwill mobilise the additional, substantial and sustained\r\nresources necessary to eradicate HIV/AIDS.\r\nIt is of particular importance to note that, in order\r\nto fight the epidemic in the low- and middle-income\r\ncountries, spending will have to double to over $6\r\nbillion by next year, and to more than $10 billion by\r\n2005. This does not include the funds needed to\r\nimprove basic health-care infrastructures. Therefore,\r\nparticularly for low and middle-income countries,\r\ninternational cooperation is needed to implement the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment in order to combat\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nIndonesia is therefore actively seeking to\r\ncooperate with its international, regional and global\r\npartners to fight AIDS. In November 2001, Indonesia,\r\nalong with its Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN) regional partners, issued a joint declaration\r\non cooperation in the combat against AIDS, including\r\nfighting drug use.\r\nFor years the infection rate for HIV/AIDS in\r\nIndonesia and in many other Asian nations remained\r\nnegligible, but in recent years the twin curses of\r\nintravenous drug use and HIV/AIDS have been\r\nspreading in Indonesia and throughout the region. At\r\npresent, it is estimated that there are about 120,000\r\nHIV/AIDS cases in Indonesia, which is still less than\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\n0.1 per cent of the population, but the risk of\r\nwidespread infection is present.\r\nIndonesia recognized the potential for this disease\r\nto grow unchecked, and as early as 1994 initiated a\r\nnational programme to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS\r\nthat included the establishment of a national AIDS\r\nPrevention and Control Commission. The AIDS\r\nprevention programme included AIDS education,\r\nprevention, testing, treatment, research, and monitoring\r\nof the progress of the programme. It also delineated\r\nroles for various levels of Government and civil\r\nsociety, and it acknowledged the need for external\r\nassistance and cooperation. In addition, earlier this\r\nyear, in line with the Declaration of Commitment,\r\nIndonesia reinvigorated its efforts to fight the twin\r\ncurses of AIDS and drugs through presidential decrees,\r\nwhich included the launching of a national movement\r\nagainst AIDS and efforts to fight drug abuse.\r\nThe national programme also acknowledged the\r\nrole of the community, especially the family, in the\r\nprevention of the disease and in caring for those\r\nalready infected. A third of those suffering from\r\nHIV/AIDS are aged 15 to 24, and new infections\r\ntypically occur at the highest rates for people in this\r\nage range. The family plays a key role in teaching\r\nyoung people to avoid unsafe activity and about the\r\nimportance of prevention. In addition, especially in\r\ndeveloping countries, the family is the main source of\r\ncare for those already infected, and so the Indonesian\r\nnational programme includes efforts to destigmatize\r\ninfected persons and maintain their full integration into\r\nsociety.\r\nOne of the most important issues is that of\r\nHIV/AIDS-related drugs. Improving the affordability\r\nof, and access to, these drugs is critical to the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS in developing countries with limited\r\nresources. Research must be funded in the developing\r\ncountries, so that cures and treatments that are\r\naffordable and acceptable to local populations can be\r\nfound. For developing countries, this is a critical issue;\r\nlife-saving drugs will not save any lives if the sick\r\nhave no access to them due to lack of money.\r\nIn conclusion, combating HIV/AIDS is one of our\r\nMillennium Development Goals, and therefore one of\r\nthe most important objectives of the international\r\ncommunity. The struggle against HIV/AIDS is,\r\nappropriately, one of international concern that requires\r\ninternational action, because this disease does not\r\nrespect international boundaries. Any solution to the\r\nHIV/AIDS problem must solve the problem for all of\r\nhumanity, rich and poor alike.\r\nMs. Kapalata (United Republic of Tanzania): At\r\nthe outset, I would like express the appreciation of my\r\ndelegation to the Secretary-General for his report\r\n(A/57/227) on the progress made towards\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS. The report, which is based on responses to\r\na questionnaire sent to Member States, provides useful\r\ninsights into the activities of Member States towards\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS. We are equally appreciative of this\r\nopportunity to discuss the matter of follow-up in the\r\nAssembly. It is our hope that the outcome of our\r\ndeliberations will take us one step forward in our\r\nstruggle against the deadly pandemic.\r\nMy delegation wishes to associate itself with the\r\nstatement just made by the representative of Senegal on\r\nbehalf of the African States. The holding of the special\r\nsession on HIV/AIDS was indeed a turning point in the\r\ntwo-decade history of the pandemic. The international\r\ncommunity had to respond to an emergency whose\r\nimport it had largely ignored for too long.\r\nWhen the General Assembly adopted the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment in June last year, it noted\r\nwith profound concern that, at the end of the year 2000,\r\n36.1 million people worldwide would be living with\r\nHIV/AIDS and that 75 per cent of them would be\r\nfound in sub-Saharan Africa; today the figure is\r\nestimated at more than $40 million. The Declaration of\r\nCommitment therefore set target dates for the\r\naccomplishment of goals in the areas of leadership,\r\nresources, prevention, care, support, treatment and\r\npartnership, among others.\r\nIt is already evident that the epidemic is getting\r\nworse, thus suggesting that responses have not been\r\ncommensurate with the magnitude of the problem.\r\nInterventions have obviously been on a smaller scale\r\nthan that demanded by the pandemic. Unless we step\r\nup our interventions, the pandemic — and here I\r\nparaphrase the Executive Director of UNAIDS — will\r\nnot defeat itself.\r\nThis grim picture notwithstanding, I wish to state\r\nhere that my Government remains fully committed to\r\nthe war against HIV/AIDS and reaffirms its resolve to\r\nimplement the Declaration of Commitment. In this\r\nregard, the President in 1998 declared HIV/AIDS a\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nnational disaster requiring the full participation of the\r\nentire Tanzanian community to combat it. In terms of\r\nleadership, my Government has provided the strong\r\nleadership that was needed. In this connection, the\r\nNational Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS prevention and\r\ncontrol was prepared. The Plan defines the framework\r\nfor an expanded multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS\r\nfor a period of five years — 1998-2002.\r\nFurthermore, immediately after the special\r\nsession in 2001, the President declared that “we have\r\nprepared ourselves for a possible victory against this\r\nterrible scourge”. This statement was made against the\r\nbackdrop of a national policy on HIV/AIDS that had\r\nalready been put in place to provide the general\r\nframework for the national response to the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. The national policy outlines the role of\r\nvarious sectors in the prevention, care and support of\r\nHIV/AIDS victims and spells out the ethics and\r\nprinciples involved in counselling and testing and in\r\nprotecting the rights of people living with the disease.\r\nThe national policy also outlines the mandate and\r\nfunctions of the Tanzania Commission for AIDS, which\r\nwas formed in 2000. The Commission works in close\r\ncollaboration with the National Advisory Board on\r\nAIDS and other bodies to spearhead a comprehensive\r\nnational response by both the public and private\r\nsectors, non-governmental organizations, community-\r\nbased organizations, families and individuals.\r\nMy Government has identified the obstacles in\r\nthe war against the pandemic as being rampant\r\nignorance, fear of the disease and stigmatization, and,\r\nmost importantly, the prevalence of poverty. Poverty\r\nlays the foundation for the spread of HIV/AIDS and\r\nsignificantly influences and fuels the spread and impact\r\nof the disease. It creates vulnerability to HIV\r\ninfections, causes rapid progression of the infection in\r\nthe individual due to malnutrition, and effectively\r\nlimits access to social and health-care services. This is\r\nas true for the individual as it is for the country. The\r\npoverty factor therefore has to be addressed not only at\r\nthe household level, but also at the national level.\r\nIt is against this background that my delegation\r\nnotes with concern the assertion in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General that the global response to the\r\nGlobal Fund has so far yielded only one third of the\r\namount required to meet the goal of annual\r\nexpenditures of about $10 billion by the year 2005. It is\r\namply manifested that without new and additional\r\nresources, most of our Governments will achieve\r\nneither the Millennium Development Goals nor those\r\ncontained in the Declaration of Commitment. It is for\r\nthis reason that my delegation strongly supports the\r\nrecommendation contained in paragraph 93 of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/57/227) that\r\n“In order to ensure an effective response to\r\nHIV/AIDS, the international community is urged\r\nto increase assistance significantly to countries\r\nwhich do not have sufficient resources for\r\ninterventions, the strengthening of sustainable\r\nhuman capacity, systems development and\r\ncapacity-building.”\r\nThe partnership between my Government and\r\nother partners in combating HIV/AIDS has grown over\r\nthe years. We have collaborated with the United\r\nNations system through its agencies, including the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World\r\nHealth Organization (WHO), the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Fund for Women and the United Nations\r\nPopulation Fund, to mention just a few. In this\r\nconnection, I would like to pay tribute to UNICEF and\r\nWHO for the ongoing pilot project on mother-to-child\r\ntransmission of HIV/AIDS in my country. We value\r\nthis assistance as a big step towards attaining the goal\r\nof reducing the proportion of infants infected with\r\nHIV/AIDS and also as an important contribution\r\ntowards the care, support and treatment of HIV/AIDS-\r\ninfected women, who are disproportionately affected\r\nby the pandemic and who bear the brunt of HIV/AIDS-\r\nrelated stigma.\r\nIn this regard, we wholeheartedly support the\r\nrecommendation of the Secretary-General in calling on\r\nUnited Nations agencies, funds and programmes, in\r\nparticular the co-sponsoring agencies of UNAIDS and\r\nthe UNAIDS secretariat, to further expand their\r\nsupport for HIV/AIDS efforts with a view to\r\ntransforming effective interventions into large-scale\r\nprojects.\r\nThe existence of non-governmental organizations\r\nthat involve themselves in caring for and supporting\r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS in my country is a\r\nwelcome development. Both the Government and civil\r\nsociety have realized that it is in their best interests to\r\nwork together. My Government has pledged\r\npartnership with responsible non-governmental\r\norganizations, particularly in educating the community\r\nand in spreading the message in the war against\r\nHIV/AIDS. In this regard, leaders of faith-based\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\norganizations have proved invaluable. It is the intention\r\nof my Government to continue to encourage this\r\npartnership, particularly in removing the barrier of\r\nsilence and stigmatization.\r\nThe challenge ahead of us is a serious one.\r\nDealing with the pandemic requires serious\r\ndetermination and innovative approaches. Some of us\r\nare operating in circumstances in which the health\r\nsystem is already overburdened and in which treatment\r\non $1 a day is proving to be a challenge.\r\nIt is therefore incumbent upon all of us,\r\nindividually and collectively, to enhance international\r\ncooperation, intensify research into the pandemic,\r\ncontinue providing the leadership required and stay\r\nfocused on the goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS. My Government is determined to win the\r\nwar against HIV/AIDS, and we are confident that, with\r\nthe collaboration and cooperation of all stakeholders\r\nand the international community, the war can be won.\r\nMr. Brereton (Australia): Australia was pleased\r\nto take part, in June 2001, in the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on HIV/AIDS. The special session\r\nsignalled the world’s recognition of the grave impact of\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nWe know that the number of people infected with\r\nHIV/AIDS across the globe will grow significantly\r\nthrough this decade. Australia is especially concerned\r\nabout the spread of the epidemic into Asia and the\r\nPacific. The epidemic in Asia threatens to become the\r\nlargest in the world. It is estimated that by 2010, China\r\nmay have 10 million to 15 million HIV/AIDS cases,\r\nand India between 20 million and 25 million — the\r\nhighest estimate for any country.\r\nBy the end of the decade, the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS in Asia will have eclipsed the projected 30\r\nmillion to 35 million cases in Central and Southern\r\nAfrica, the current focal point of the epidemic. In some\r\nAsian countries there are localized pockets of\r\nHIV/AIDS — among intravenous drug users and sex\r\nworkers for example. We cannot be complacent in view\r\nof the possibility that these pockets of infection will\r\ngrow rapidly and spread to the general population.\r\nIn the Pacific, Papua New Guinea faces a\r\npotential epidemic comparable to that experienced by\r\nAfrican countries. Even the small Pacific island\r\ncountries, so remote in so many ways, are beginning to\r\nconfront HIV/AIDS.\r\nLast year’s special session was a landmark in the\r\ndevelopment of global, regional and local responses to\r\nthe pandemic. Since then, further work has been done\r\non estimating the resources required to respond to the\r\npandemic. Another funding mechanism, the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, has\r\nbeen established. Australia looks forward to the Fund\r\nimplementing projects and achieving results on the\r\nground.\r\nAnother development has been the reduction in\r\nthe price of some treatments for HIV/AIDS. Australia\r\nwelcomes the work of the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), a number of\r\npharmaceutical companies, non-governmental\r\norganizations and national Governments in negotiating\r\nthese reductions, including through the World Trade\r\nOrganization Doha negotiations.\r\nHowever, much more work needs to be done. The\r\ncost of antiretroviral drugs, which can prolong the lives\r\nof infected people, is still prohibitively high in many\r\npopulous, low-income countries. Moreover, drug-\r\nresistant HIV/AIDS strains may spread because of the\r\ninconsistent use of antiretroviral therapies and the\r\nmanufacture of substandard medications.\r\nOf course, drug costs are only a portion of the\r\ncost of treating HIV/AIDS. Other significant barriers\r\ninclude medical capacity, logistics and resources. Nor\r\nshould greater attention being directed towards\r\ntreatment lessen the critical focus on the prevention of\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nLeadership is vital to meet these challenges —\r\nleadership from Governments, from international\r\norganizations, from the private sector and from civil\r\nsociety. Without leadership, the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS cannot be won. Leadership must be\r\ncombined with good governance to ensure the effective\r\ndelivery of the response.\r\nAustralia’s own response has been significant,\r\nand we are determined to play our part, especially in\r\nthe development of political leadership, regional\r\ncooperation and plans in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nIn October 2001, Australia hosted the Asia-\r\nPacific Ministerial Meeting on HIV/AIDS to discuss\r\nthe impact of the pandemic on regional development.\r\nThis successful meeting was a follow-up to the United\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nNations special session and was the first of its kind,\r\nbringing together ministers and officials with a range\r\nof portfolios from 33 countries, representing over half\r\nof the world’s population.\r\nAustralia is working to ensure that a second\r\nministerial meeting to follow up the Asia-Pacific\r\nresponse to HIV/AIDS is held in 2003.\r\nOne outcome of the Asia-Pacific Ministerial\r\nMeeting in 2001 was the establishment of the Asia\r\nPacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS and\r\nDevelopment. The Leadership Forum, which should\r\ncommence activities in early 2003, will inform leaders\r\nand provide opportunities to share information and\r\nexperiences in dealing with the pandemic through a\r\nvariety of programmes. The Forum, launched in Brunei\r\nin August by the Ministers of the countries members of\r\nthe Association of South-East Asian Nations and of\r\nAustralia, has wide support among regional countries.\r\nAustralia provided funding to UNAIDS for the\r\nestablishment of the Leadership Forum, and we are\r\npleased to see that it has been supported by other\r\ndonors, including the United Kingdom, Japan, the\r\nEuropean Union, the United States and New Zealand.\r\nIn addition, Australia continues to fund programmes,\r\nmainly in Asia and the Pacific, to assist countries to\r\nrespond directly to the pandemic through a six-year,\r\n$200 million global HIV/AIDS initiative. Australia is\r\nprepared, if asked, to assist other Asia-Pacific\r\nGovernments to develop legislation to facilitate cost-\r\neffective access to essential HIV/AIDS drugs,\r\nconsistent with international trade agreements.\r\nAustralia is also willing to support applied research or\r\nspecific trials to help countries assess alternatives for\r\nintroducing new HIV/AIDS treatments.\r\nAustralia recently reviewed its aid priorities.\r\nHIV/AIDS will continue to be a key priority for our aid\r\nprogramme. But all countries must continue to work to\r\nbuild momentum in the global response to the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. This is a humanitarian\r\nimperative.\r\nToday Australia reaffirms its support for the\r\npriorities for action of the Declaration of Commitment\r\non HIV/AIDS. We note that one third of the time-\r\nbound goals and targets identified in the Declaration\r\nare due in 2003. More will be due in 2005.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s annual follow-up report\r\non the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS,\r\ndetailing progress made and identifying problems and\r\nconstraints, should help maintain the momentum of the\r\ninternational response.\r\nHowever, there is still a need for better\r\ninformation to track the pandemic. UNAIDS has\r\ndeveloped a set of indicators to measure progress by\r\nMember States in achieving the commitments. These\r\nindicators will serve as a valuable tool and go some\r\nway to improving knowledge of the disease, the\r\nevolution of the pandemic and responses to it.\r\nThe continuing expansion of the pandemic,\r\nespecially in Asia, will spark calls for more financial\r\nand technical support from donor countries such as\r\nAustralia. It may also lead to argument over how to\r\ndisburse international funds, such as the Global Fund\r\nfor HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We will need\r\nto respond to these challenges in a timely and proactive\r\nway.\r\nFinally, Australia believes that, with multiple\r\ntargets set for 2003, there is value — and a good deal\r\nof value — in a full day of discussions on the follow-\r\nup of the Declaration of Commitment next year. Such a\r\ndebate — we put it to the United Nations — could\r\nperhaps take place either during or following the\r\nannual general debate, and usefully could also include\r\nrepresentatives from civil society.\r\nMrs. Taylor Roberts (Jamaica): The special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS marked\r\na significant milestone in our collective response to\r\nwhat has been agreed as constituting a “global\r\nemergency”. In the absence of a truly effective global\r\nresponse to this epidemic, through meaningful efforts\r\nto achieve the goals and targets set in the Declaration\r\nof Commitment on HIV/AIDS, social and economic\r\ndevelopment will continue to be seriously threatened,\r\nand the gains made in advancing the well-being of the\r\nworld’s people, significantly eroded.\r\nGiven the impact of HIV/AIDS on the productive\r\npopulation, it has proved particularly devastating in\r\nterms of increasing poverty and vulnerability, reversing\r\nhuman development and eroding the ability of\r\nGovernments to provide basic social services. Indeed,\r\nthe disastrous impact of the epidemic on the social and\r\neconomic development of those countries that are\r\nhighly affected will prove to be one of the most\r\ncompelling challenges to the realization of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nWe are, therefore, pleased with the progress that\r\nhas been made in implementing commitments\r\nundertaken in the Declaration of Commitment, as\r\noutlined in the report of the Secretary-General. We are\r\nalso pleased to note that political commitment\r\ncontinues to increase and that most countries indicate\r\nan increase in national investment in HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes, with total spending for low and middle\r\nincome countries having grown by over 50 per cent in\r\n2002. This development is particularly important given\r\nthat the epidemic cannot be reversed without\r\nsubstantial increases in resources.\r\nDespite this progress, however, there is a clear\r\nindication that there continues to be a significant\r\nshortfall in overall funding for the global response. In\r\nour review of the results achieved since 2001, we see\r\nan urgent need to increase global funding, given that\r\noverall funding is still one third of the amount required\r\nto meet the goal of annual expenditures of $10 billion\r\nby 2005. The fight against HIV/AIDS can only be\r\nsuccessful in the context of strengthened and effective\r\npartnerships. National Governments have taken\r\nsignificant steps aimed at strengthening their\r\nresponses. However, as is clear in the report, the\r\nimplementation of national strategies has been slow.\r\nThere can be little doubt that progress will continue to\r\nbe slow if serious constraints caused by excessive\r\neconomic burdens continue to impede capacity to\r\nallocate sufficient resources to fight the disease. In\r\norder to increase the ability to address the problem,\r\nparticularly in developing countries, there is a clear\r\nneed for enhanced partnerships to expand resources\r\nand human and technical capacity to ensure that the\r\nscale of the country-level activities matches the gravity\r\nof the problem to be solved.\r\nWe are also concerned that only 10 to 20 per cent\r\nof people at risk of HIV infection have access to basic\r\nprevention services and that an almost indiscernible\r\nnumber of pregnant women, particularly in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, are reached by interventions to prevent\r\nmother-to-child transmissions. If we are to achieve\r\nsuccess, greater effort must be made to enhance\r\npreventive services and to reduce the high cost of\r\nantiretroviral drugs, particularly in the most affected\r\ncountries.\r\nWhile we note in paragraph 68 of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report that the total number of persons in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean region who have\r\naccess to antiretrovirals has increased, we believe that\r\nthis figure remains unsatisfactory, particularly when\r\ndisaggregated by States and socio-economic groupings.\r\nIn this regard, we recall that the Agreement on Trade-\r\nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights should\r\nno longer constitute an obstacle to the right to promote\r\naccess to medicines for all.\r\nIf the goals set out in the Declaration of\r\nCommitment are to be met, there should also be greater\r\nsupport for national efforts to expand medical services,\r\nincluding palliative care and prevention and treatment\r\nof opportunistic infections. Expanded research into the\r\ndevelopment of a safe and effective vaccine should also\r\nbe a priority. We are, therefore, concerned that only 1.6\r\nper cent of all HIV/AIDS research is focused on the\r\ndevelopment of a vaccine suitable for use in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, the worst-affected region. This clearly\r\nconfirms the point that global research priorities are\r\nnot sufficiently oriented towards urgent health needs in\r\nresource-constrained countries.\r\nNational leaders must take a leading role in the\r\nfight against the epidemic, including contributing to\r\nefforts to remove the stigma attached to the disease. As\r\nemphasized by the Secretary-General, in most\r\ncountries where major progress has been reported,\r\nstrong political leadership is a central feature. In\r\nJamaica, political leaders have been at the forefront of\r\nour national effort to combat HIV/AIDS and have\r\ngiven special focus to this disease by conducting a\r\nparliamentary debate on the issue.\r\nSince the adoption of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment, Jamaica has also increased its efforts to\r\ncombat the disease, through the adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive national framework involving all\r\nsectors. In December 2001, the Cabinet approved the\r\nNational Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS for the period\r\n2002-2006. The plan outlines an integrated national\r\nresponse across sectors, ensuring the participation and\r\nimplementation of programmes and policies aimed at\r\nadvancing the human rights of people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS, and the most vulnerable groups in society.\r\nThe National Plan prioritizes policy advocacy;\r\nprevention; care, treatment and support; and\r\nmonitoring, surveillance and evaluation. Additionally,\r\nan inter-ministerial working group on HIV/AIDS has\r\nbeen established to ensure an integrated effort in the\r\nplanning and monitoring of HIV/AIDS activities across\r\nline ministries and sectors. In February of this year, the\r\nGovernment of Jamaica, in collaboration with the\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nUnited Nations system, non-governmental\r\norganizations and the private sector, developed a\r\nstrategy to accelerate and expand access to\r\ncomprehensive care and support for those living with\r\nthe disease. This strategy seeks to build capacity at all\r\nlevels in the care system, increase access to\r\nantiretroviral drugs, expand the programme for the\r\nprevention of mother-to-child transmission and\r\nstrengthen advocacy and resource mobilization.\r\nDespite that progress, however, there is still a\r\nneed for new laws to address the human rights of\r\npersons affected by the disease. As in other Caribbean\r\nStates, which share a regional strategic approach,\r\nJamaica is in the process of reviewing current\r\nlegislation to strengthen anti-discrimination laws.\r\nThe Caribbean faces a formidable challenge, a\r\nchallenge shared by many regions and most States,\r\nalmost without exception. If a lesson has been learned\r\nfrom the report before us, it is that our effort must be\r\ncollective. We have made important progress in this\r\nregard. Much, however, remains to be done in\r\nstrengthening leadership, increasing resources,\r\nimproving preventive strategies and enhancing care and\r\nsupport for those affected. These challenges must be\r\nmet with the greatest urgency. We have initiated the\r\nprocess, but we must be unrelenting in strengthening\r\nour resolve to achieve the goals we set during the\r\nspecial session.\r\nMr. Moura (Brazil): More than a year ago, we\r\nadopted the Declaration of Commitment, which\r\nestablished a universal strategy to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe special session confirmed the leadership role of the\r\nUnited Nations in addressing the epidemic. The United\r\nNations succeeded in putting together developing and\r\ndeveloped countries, international institutions, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private\r\nsector to promote a common vision on this issue.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment also highlighted\r\nhow crucial international cooperation is. This outcome\r\nput an end to discussions on whether the priority\r\nshould fall on prevention or treatment, whether\r\nHIV/AIDS was a human rights issue or purely a\r\nmedical one, whether medicines should be made\r\navailable to developing countries, and whether the\r\nresponse should rely on action by national\r\nGovernments or on action by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General provokes\r\nmixed feelings on the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration. On the one hand, it demonstrates that the\r\nDeclaration has become an invaluable reference to\r\ncountries and institutions in their efforts to combat the\r\nepidemic. On the other hand, it shows that\r\nimplementation has left much to be desired.\r\nThis ambivalence is visible in the area of\r\ninternational cooperation. The creation of the Global\r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was an\r\nimportant achievement. The approval of the first\r\nprojects represented a breakthrough, because they\r\nincluded the provision of antiretroviral drugs.\r\nUnfortunately, the Fund has not been provided with\r\nresources commensurate with its needs. Estimates by\r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO)\r\nhave shown that the yearly amount necessary to combat\r\nthe epidemic is $10 billion. Thus far, pledges have\r\nreached $2 billion, and are far from meeting the needs\r\nof all the projects submitted for approval.\r\nAnother area where we can see both positive and\r\nnegative results is that of access to medicines. The\r\nspecial session stressed the importance of affordability,\r\nthe production of generic drugs and differential pricing.\r\nSince then, we have made some headway. For instance,\r\nthe fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) adopted the Declaration on the\r\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\r\nProperty Rights and Public Health, emphasizing that\r\nthe Agreement\r\n“can and should be interpreted and implemented\r\nin a manner supportive of WTO members’ right\r\nto protect public health and, in particular, to\r\npromote access to medicines for all.”\r\n(WT/MIN(01)/Dec/W/2, para. 4)\r\nSome private companies have adopted a\r\ncooperative approach, and have offered drugs at lower\r\nprices to some developing countries. The importance of\r\nthe use of generic drugs has also been acknowledged.\r\nFor example, the Global Fund will encourage countries\r\napplying for grants to buy the lowest-priced medicines.\r\nIn spite of those advancements, however, we are\r\nlagging behind in our objective of increasing the\r\ntreatment opportunities for people living with HIV or\r\nAIDS. The figures are alarming. Only 250,000 people\r\nin developing countries are receiving antiretroviral\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\ntherapy, out of the 6 million who should be treated with\r\nsuch drugs.\r\nThe results Brazil has achieved in its fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS are based on a balanced approach to\r\nprevention and treatment and on advocacy of human\r\nrights. The Brazilian Government has pursued those\r\npolicies since the beginning of the epidemic, and has\r\nalways counted on strong cooperation from civil\r\nsociety.\r\nPrevention policies in Brazil include universal\r\naccess to condoms, women’s empowerment, the\r\ninclusion of issues relating to HIV/AIDS in school\r\ncurricula, the implementation of programmes aimed at\r\npreventing mother-to-child transmission and the\r\ndevelopment of strategies for the most vulnerable\r\ngroups and those at highest risk of infection.\r\nAs far as treatment is concerned, one of the main\r\nelements of the Brazilian response is free and universal\r\naccess to medicines, including antiretroviral therapy.\r\nNowadays, nearly 120,000 people in Brazil are on\r\nantiretroviral drugs. This policy has borne fruit. The\r\ndeath rate has been slashed by 50 per cent,\r\nhospitalization rates have dropped by 75 per cent, and\r\nopportunistic diseases have been dramatically reduced.\r\nOver the last five years, we avoided 360,000\r\nhospitalizations, saving $1.1 billion. In the same\r\nperiod, we spent $1.4 billion in antiretroviral\r\nmedicines. The public health service has become less\r\noverburdened, and the provision of treatment has led us\r\nto upgrade them. If it were possible to look at this issue\r\nfrom merely an economic perspective, this policy\r\nwould be seen as cost-effective.\r\nThe positive consequences of these policies are\r\nfar-reaching. The number of people with HIV/AIDS\r\nnow is half what some studies foresaw a decade ago.\r\nSince they know treatment is within their reach, people\r\nfeel encouraged to undergo HIV/AIDS testing, which is\r\nconfidential and voluntary. While receiving treatment,\r\npeople are kept in close contact with the health system\r\nand have access to information, counselling and\r\npreventive supplies. In addition, treatment serves to\r\nreduce viral loads. For all these reasons, treatment also\r\nhas a significant impact on prevention, which only\r\nreinforces the importance of an integrated approach.\r\nThis treatment policy would be much more\r\ndifficult to pursue if it were not for the local production\r\nof medicines. We now produce eight generic versions\r\nof non-patented antiretroviral drugs at low cost.\r\nEffective or potential competition from local\r\ncompanies is making producers bring their prices\r\ndown, on average by 70 per cent.\r\nAnother crucial element of our policy is respect\r\nfor human rights, which has been put into practice in\r\nthe two aspects highlighted in the Declaration of\r\nCommitment. First, we fight the stigma still associated\r\nwith HIV/AIDS, as well as other kinds of social\r\ndiscrimination that help to spread the epidemic.\r\nSecondly, we put access to drugs at the core of our\r\nprogramme, for this is essential to achieve the full\r\nrealization of the human right to enjoyment of the\r\nhighest standards of physical and mental health.\r\nAnother important component of our programme\r\nis the cooperation of civil society. Over recent years,\r\nwe have developed almost 2,000 projects with more\r\nthan 600 non-governmental organizations.\r\nCooperation is a key word in the fight against the\r\nepidemic. That is why the Brazilian Government has\r\nimplemented projects with Latin American, Caribbean\r\nand African countries and has offered to transfer\r\ntechnology to developing countries. Brazil has also\r\nbeen a member of the Global Fund since its inception.\r\nWhile all those policies are fundamental, a more\r\neffective solution to the problem will only be achieved\r\nwith the development of vaccines. Brazil is now\r\ninvesting in setting up the infrastructure necessary to\r\nparticipate more actively in the testing of vaccines.\r\nThe history of the response to HIV/AIDS is\r\nsimilar to that of Sisyphus, the mythological character\r\nwhose task it was to push a stone uphill, only to see it\r\nroll down when he reached the top. The fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS is ceaseless. The accomplishment of an\r\nobjective immediately leads to another challenge.\r\nWhen we met last year to adopt the Declaration\r\nof Commitment, our objective was to adopt a common\r\nvision on how to fight the epidemic. Now the challenge\r\nconsists of turning our commitments into reality. The\r\nmeans to combat the epidemic already exist. If we do\r\nnot use them, we will transform a human tragedy into a\r\nmoral one.\r\nIn the present uphill journey, implementation\r\nmust be our urgent challenge.\r\nMs. Ndhlovu (South Africa): I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the President on his\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nMy delegation wishes to convey its appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General for his report on progress\r\ntowards implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, as contained in document\r\nA/57/227. We also wish to express our appreciation to\r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS) for its continued commitment to assisting\r\nMember States with this global pandemic.\r\nWe are encouraged by the efforts and the progress\r\nreported on implementing measures to reduce\r\nHIV/AIDS infection, and we wish to convey our\r\nstrongest support for the regular evaluation of the\r\nglobal response to HIV/AIDS.\r\nSouth Africa is a proud signatory to the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted on\r\n27 June 2001. The Declaration echoed the national\r\ncommitments of South Africa to fight HIV/AIDS,\r\nsexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis and\r\nmalaria, as enunciated in my Government’s current\r\nstrategic plan.\r\nSubsequent conferences, including the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, addressed\r\nHIV/AIDS by adopting key actions. The goals and\r\nobjectives contained in the Declaration of Commitment\r\non HIV/AIDS were reaffirmed and strengthened\r\nthrough that integrated approach.\r\nMy Government also responded to the request of\r\nthe UNAIDS secretariat earlier this year to report on\r\nprogress at the national level since the twenty-sixth\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS, in preparation for\r\ntoday’s debate.\r\nWhen we speak of follow-up and implementation\r\nof the outcome of the special session, allow me to\r\nbriefly highlight progress made at the national level.\r\nThe South African Cabinet, in its statement of 17 April\r\n2002, expressed its resolve to fully implement the\r\npriorities and programmes contained in the HIV/AIDS\r\nand Sexually Transmitted Infections Strategic Plan for\r\nSouth Africa, 2000-2005, which comprises four key\r\nareas; namely prevention; treatment, care and support;\r\nhuman and legal rights and research, monitoring and\r\nsurveillance.\r\nThe South Africa Government has earmarked the\r\nnecessary financial resources. In the current financial\r\nyear 2002-2003 it has allocated 1 billion rands to the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS and related diseases. In the\r\nnext financial year that amount will increase to 1.3\r\nbillion rands, and in the subsequent year to 1.8 billion\r\nrands. Those funds are channelled primarily through\r\nthe Departments of Health, Education and Social\r\nDevelopment.\r\nGovernment departments have implemented\r\nHIV/AIDS policies related to health insurance, service\r\nbenefits, discrimination, stigma, leave and productivity.\r\nGovernment departments also include poverty\r\nalleviation strategies as part of their instituted\r\nHIV/AIDS programmes.\r\nThrough a partnership with the private sector in\r\nSouth Africa, industries, such as the mining, transport\r\nand hospitality sectors in particular, have established\r\nworkplace programmes to deal with the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic. Business initiatives are increasing with the\r\nrecent launch of South Africa’s first comprehensive\r\nHIV/AIDS workplace solution, which manages the\r\nhealth of HIV-positive employees and implements\r\npreventative strategies to reduce new infections on\r\nbehalf of medium- to large-size organizations and\r\ntransfers the risk from the employer to the insurer.\r\nFurthermore, South Africa has developed a\r\nprogramme for the prevention of mother-to-child\r\ntransmission. The pilot phase will cover more than\r\n100,000 women in its first year. At the end of the pilot\r\nphase, ending this December, the programme will be\r\nimplemented throughout South Africa.\r\nIn addition, a new programme to provide a\r\npackage of care, including antiretroviral therapy, to\r\nsurvivors of rape has been instituted, and a bill was\r\napproved for submission to Parliament on compulsory\r\nHIV testing of alleged sexual offenders, which\r\nprovides for a speedy and uncomplicated mechanism\r\nfor victims of sexual offences to apply for the alleged\r\nperpetrator to be tested for HIV/AIDS, with the results\r\ndisclosed to the victim.\r\nThrough the Department of Social Development,\r\nactivities relating to the support of children orphaned\r\nby HIV/AIDS are coordinated. They include the\r\nprovision of social grants, as well as the distribution of\r\nfood parcels. We have also allocated additional\r\nresources amounting to 450 million rands over three\r\nyears, targeted at children infected and affected by the\r\nepidemic. That includes, inter alia, a comprehensive\r\napproach to caring for orphans, as well as accelerating\r\nthe implementation of a life-skills programme as a\r\ncompulsory element of the curriculum in schools.\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.45\r\nCivil society and community participation,\r\nthrough volunteerism and assistance to orphans and\r\npersons living with HIV/AIDS, increases on a daily\r\nbasis. We are encouraged by the response from South\r\nAfricans to the call for help in a spirit of oneness.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the recommendations\r\nissued in document A/57/227 and supports the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendations to appeal once\r\nagain to the international community to increase\r\nassistance significantly to countries lacking sufficient\r\nresources.\r\nIt is also our view that the global HIV/AIDS\r\nresearch programmes for a safe and effective\r\npreventive vaccine should remain a global priority. In\r\nthis regard, the South African Medical Research\r\nCouncil will initiate South Africa’s first HIV/Aids\r\nvaccine trials early next year. The first phase of the\r\ntrials could start as early as February, on condition that\r\nenough volunteers make themselves available. The\r\ntrials will be done in conjunction with Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity in the United States and other chosen sites.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report, also\r\nidentifies a key element that many countries face in\r\ndealing with the pandemic — building capacity to\r\nenhance effective interventions. South Africa has to\r\ndeal with large numbers of persons infected and\r\naffected by HIV/AIDS, and we need vast resources,\r\nparticularly human and financial resources.\r\nLike many other countries in Africa, we, too,\r\nstruggle with the challenge of having insufficient\r\ncapacities, especially in our health sector and in our\r\ncommunities. Training community health workers to\r\npromote prevention and to provide home-based care\r\nand counselling for HIV/AIDS patients poses a\r\nconstant challenge.\r\nOne of the important outcomes of the special\r\nsession was the establishment of the Global Fund to\r\nfight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria as a\r\nfinancing mechanism for additional resources. The\r\nGlobal Fund was born out of the understanding that\r\nmore than $10 billion are required yearly to address\r\nHIV/AIDS and related infectious diseases. My\r\ndelegation notes with some concern that, to date, only\r\n$2 billion have been committed to the Fund. It is the\r\nview of my delegation that, in order to progress in\r\nimplementing the special session’s Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, the Fund must be\r\nstrengthened and the process and procedures related to\r\naccessing resources through successful applications of\r\nthe Global Fund should be accelerated.\r\nIn conclusion, the African Union has identified\r\nHIV/AIDS as a critical challenge that requires total\r\ncommitment at all levels of society. Africa has been\r\nactively engaged on this issue. The leaders of our\r\ncontinent and Governments have met on numerous\r\noccasions to pledge their political commitment to\r\nprotect and prevent this and other infectious diseases in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\ndeals extensively with the issue of development and\r\nhealth, including HIV/AIDS and related diseases, and\r\nemphasizes the need to reduce the root causes of the\r\npandemic, such as underdevelopment, poverty and\r\nlimited access to resources.\r\nFinally, the motto of the multisectoral programme\r\non HIV/AIDS in South Africa is “All our actions\r\ncount”. South Africans all agree that more must be\r\ndone to curb the huge human tragedy unfolding in my\r\ncountry. My delegation would like to suggest that, as a\r\nglobal forum, taking into account all partners identified\r\nin the Declaration, we as a collective adopt this motto\r\nas a way forward: “All our actions count”.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to draw\r\nmembers’ attention to the draft resolution contained in\r\ndocument A/57/L.13/Rev.1, entitled “Open-ended\r\npanel of the General Assembly on ‘Afghanistan: one\r\nyear later’”, issued under agenda items 21 (d) —\r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian and\r\ndisaster relief assistance of the United Nations,\r\nincluding special economic assistance: Emergency\r\ninternational assistance for peace, normalcy and\r\nreconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan” — and 37\r\n — “The situation in Afghanistan and its implications\r\nfor international peace and security”.\r\nThe General Assembly will take action on that\r\ndraft resolution on Monday, 11 November, in the\r\nafternoon as the second item.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
