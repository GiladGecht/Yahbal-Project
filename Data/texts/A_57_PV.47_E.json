Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n02-68435 (E)\r\n*0268435*\r\nPresident: Mr. Kavan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3:10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 39\r\nQuestion of the Falklands Islands (Malvinas)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform\r\nrepresentatives that, following consultations regarding\r\nagenda item 39 on the question of the Falkland Islands\r\n(Malvinas) and taking into account General Assembly\r\ndecision 56/410 of 26 November 2001, it is proposed\r\nthat the General Assembly decide to postpone\r\nconsideration of this item and to include it in the\r\nprovisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session.\r\nMay I take it therefore that the Assembly, taking\r\ninto account decision 56/410, wishes to defer\r\nconsideration of this item and include it in the\r\nprovisional agenda of the fifty-eighth session?\r\nIt was so decided (decision 57/511).\r\nAgenda items 21 (d) and 37\r\nEmergency international assistance for peace,\r\nnormalcy and reconstruction of war-stricken\r\nAfghanistan\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan and its implications for\r\ninternational peace and security\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.13/Rev.1)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will\r\nconsider sub-item (d) of agenda item 21, “Emergency\r\ninternational assistance for peace, normalcy and\r\nreconstruction of war-stricken Afghanistan”; and\r\nagenda item 37, “The situation in Afghanistan and its\r\nimplications for international peace and security” and\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.13/Rev.1 entitled “Open-ended\r\npanel of the General Assembly on ‘Afghanistan: one\r\nyear later’”.\r\nThe idea of organizing a panel discussion on\r\nAfghanistan as an interactive dialogue with interested\r\nMember States has received overwhelming support\r\nfrom many countries concerned, including the Security\r\nCouncil members, the neighbouring countries and\r\nmany influential States, such as Germany, France, Italy,\r\nJapan, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, just to name a\r\nfew.\r\nThis panel discussion is also very closely\r\nintertwined with my own efforts as the President of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly to\r\nrevitalize its meetings.\r\nThese were the reasons that I decided to link this\r\npanel, scheduled for 18 November, with this year’s\r\nplenary session on Afghanistan, to be held on 6\r\nDecember. I do strongly believe that the panel\r\ndiscussion can enrich this year’s commemoration of the\r\nfirst anniversary of the Bonn Conference and could\r\nlead the United Nations to specific conclusions in\r\nterms of post-conflict reconstruction in Afghanistan,\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nthereby providing new recommendations for future\r\nUnited Nations activities in this domain.\r\nTo achieve these goals, I ask you to be prepared\r\nfor such a discussion. What I envisage as very\r\nimportant are our attempts to find out what were the\r\nlessons learned by the United Nations in Afghanistan.\r\nThe panel should also give us an opportunity to see the\r\nconsequences of the decisions adopted by the United\r\nNations and to find out if these decisions were properly\r\nimplemented. What are the results that these decisions\r\nhelped us to achieve? Should we modify our\r\nhumanitarian activities and economic assistance in\r\nAfghanistan? What else needs to be done in order for\r\nus to achieve United Nations goals in Afghanistan\r\nsooner and more effectively? I do truly hope that we\r\nwill be able to meet these criteria.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of the\r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Chen (Under-Secretary-General, Department\r\nof General Assembly Affairs and Conference\r\nManagement): Under operative paragraph 1 of draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.13/Rev.1, the General Assembly\r\ndecides to convene, on 18 November 2002, an open-\r\nended panel on Afghanistan, which will have two\r\nconsecutive sessions, one from 9 to 11 a.m., and the\r\nother, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.\r\nShould the General Assembly adopt draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.13/Rev.1, no additional expenditure\r\nwould be required, since the open-ended panel would\r\nbe convened on a date and time when the plenary\r\nwould not be in session. The related meeting servicing\r\ncosts would be met, therefore, from overall resources\r\nearmarked for the meetings of the plenary.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on draft resolution A/57/L.13/Rev.1.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.13/Rev.1?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution\r\n57/8).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item\r\n(d) of agenda item 21 and agenda item 37.\r\nAgenda item 14 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nMr. Singh (India): At the outset, let me\r\ncompliment the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA) on its completion of 45 years as a unique\r\nmultidisciplinary international organization,\r\nfunctioning to fulfil its mandate to the satisfaction of\r\nall its stakeholders. The Agency is a unique\r\nprofessional body in the area of nuclear science and\r\ntechnology, with the ability and wherewithal to provide\r\nsolutions to various issues concerning all of us. The\r\nAgency has not shied away from adding new\r\ndimensions to its activities, while at the same time\r\nmaintaining a careful balance among all its statutory\r\nactivities.\r\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\r\nrecently concluded its work in Johannesburg. The\r\nthreat to our global climate due to increasing carbon\r\ndioxide emission is even more evident than in the past.\r\nNotwithstanding the important role of renewable and\r\nother clean energy technologies, and given the\r\nmagnitude of this problem, there can be no doubt that\r\nnuclear power is an inevitable option at the present\r\nstate of development of advanced energy technologies\r\nand can meet the development aspirations of a large\r\nfraction of the world’s population, while at the same\r\ntime conforming to the criteria of sustainability. It is\r\nironic that, in spite of its large energy potential, with\r\nthe capability of meeting sustainable worldwide energy\r\nneeds without any real or significant environmental\r\nimpact, the unfounded misconceptions about nuclear\r\nenergy still dominate and have impeded sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt the present juncture, one sees nuclear power\r\nsimultaneously witnessing stagnation, renaissance and\r\ngrowth in different parts of the world. During the\r\n1990s, the gross generation of nuclear electricity in\r\nAsia grew by 63.7 per cent, and the availability of\r\nglobal nuclear energy increased from 73 per cent to\r\nover 82 per cent, which is equivalent to adding 33\r\ngigawatts of new generating capacity.\r\nThere is growing activity to extend the lives of\r\nexisting nuclear power plants. This exercise is\r\nequivalent to building new reactors in those countries.\r\nAn integrated view of technology, safety, safeguards\r\nand the newly emerging scenario with respect to\r\nnuclear terrorism is, however, necessary to find holistic\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nanswers that can eliminate the barriers to large-scale\r\ndevelopment of nuclear power in a sustainable manner.\r\nRecognizing the important role of nuclear power\r\nin meeting long-term energy needs, India has accorded\r\nhigh priority to the self-reliant development of nuclear\r\npower in the country. This has enabled a strong\r\nindigenous capability in all aspects of the nuclear fuel\r\ncycle. Presently, construction on eight more reactors is\r\nin progress — the largest number of reactors currently\r\nunder construction in any country. These units include\r\nsix pressurized heavy water reactors of indigenous\r\ndesign and two 1,000 megawatt units being set up in\r\ncooperation with the Russian Federation. Construction\r\non all projects is progressing in advance of their\r\nrespective schedules.\r\nOur 14 operating nuclear power reactors have\r\ntogether registered an impressive 85 per cent average\r\nannual capacity factor during the past year and, at the\r\nsame time, have maintained an excellent safety record.\r\nIn line with keeping our commitment to the\r\npreservation of the environment, most of the operating\r\npower plants have also obtained Environment\r\nManagement System (EMS) ISO 14001 certification.\r\nMiss Clarke (Barbados), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe will reach a total nuclear capacity of 6,680\r\nmegawatts by 2008, and we intend to achieve 10,000\r\nmegawatts by 2012 and 20,000 megawatts by 2020. In\r\norder to achieve that objective, given the nuclear\r\nresource profile available within the country, we have\r\nalso carried out considerable work on the design and\r\ndevelopment of a plutonium-uranium-oxide-fuelled,\r\n500-megawatt prototype fast breeder reactor at\r\nKalpakkam. While the pre-project activities for\r\nconstruction of that reactor are already in progress, we\r\nwill soon launch the main project.\r\nThe expansion of our nuclear power programme\r\nis being appropriately supported by the opening of two\r\nnew uranium mines in Jharkhand State in India. We\r\nhave also undertaken pre-project activities for the\r\ncommencement of uranium mining at three more sites.\r\nIn addition, we have taken significant steps, including\r\nreducing specific energy consumption in heavy water\r\nproduction and compressing the construction schedule,\r\nso as to make nuclear power even more competitive. In\r\nfact, the Indian track record on export controls and\r\nfulfilment of its international obligations has been\r\nexemplary, to the extent that India has been described\r\nas a classic non-proliferator.\r\nWhile the Indian programme is designed to cater\r\nto the country’s long-term energy needs, the recent\r\nawareness of the impact of carbon dioxide emissions\r\non the global climate has necessitated expeditious\r\nlarge-scale development of nuclear power in India.\r\nExternal additionalities in the nuclear power sector, for\r\nwhich there is a large market in India, could help that\r\nprocess further. However, our efforts to accelerate the\r\ndevelopment of nuclear power as a sustainable means\r\nof producing the clean energy needed to meet the\r\ndevelopment aspirations of one sixth of humanity are\r\nfaced with the restrictive export policies of certain\r\ncountries. It is common knowledge that India’s nuclear\r\nprogramme is unique by virtue of its indigenous and\r\ncomprehensive capabilities, and therefore any\r\nproliferation concern over external supplies to India is\r\nunfounded. Making external additionalities in nuclear\r\npower development in India subject to such irrelevant\r\nand unfounded concerns will only increase the\r\ndependence on fossil fuel, resulting in damage to the\r\nglobal environment.\r\nOur atomic energy programme has accorded top\r\npriority to safety in all its activities and has kept pace\r\nwith needs, accompanied by the expansion of the\r\nnuclear power programme and by the utilization of\r\nnuclear technologies for research, health, agricultural\r\nand industrial purposes. We have gained close to 200\r\nreactor-years of operating experience, with a good\r\ntrack record in maintaining the safety of operating\r\npersonnel, of the public and of the environment.\r\nNeedless to say, safety cannot be divorced from\r\ntechnology. However, it is unfortunate that, in practice,\r\ntechnologies continue to be denied to us, even for\r\nsystems important to safety.\r\nThe IAEA’s International Project on Innovative\r\nNuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) is a most\r\nappropriate and timely measure and will help to\r\novercome barriers to the growth of nuclear power for\r\nglobal sustainable development. We are convinced that\r\nsuch technological solutions are the need of the hour\r\nand that they provide superior, cost-effective and\r\ncomprehensive alternatives to the current segmental\r\napproach of dealing separately with technology, safety\r\nand safeguards. We have taken an active part in that\r\nprogramme, which the Agency is implementing\r\nthrough extra budgetary resources, and we have also\r\nprovided cost-free experts. We feel that the time has\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\ncome for the Agency to absorb the INPRO programme\r\ninto its regular budget.\r\nWe are glad that the Agency responded promptly\r\nto the need for nuclear security following the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001 by, among other things,\r\nsetting up an Advisory Group on Nuclear Security. We\r\nshould eliminate any possibility for terrorists to exploit\r\nthe potential of using nuclear material and radioactive\r\nsources, particularly for blackmail. Although the prime\r\nresponsibility for the security and safety of nuclear and\r\nother radioactive materials and of nuclear facilities\r\nrests and must rest with States themselves, the\r\nAgency’s additional activities can contribute\r\nmeaningfully to protection against nuclear terrorism.\r\nAs it does so, we should ensure that it does not add\r\nunduly to the sense of apprehension that exists in many\r\nquarters concerning the safety of using nuclear energy\r\nfor peaceful purposes.\r\nIndia has acceded to the Convention on the\r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material, which\r\nreinforces its commitment to international instruments\r\nagainst terrorism in general and against nuclear\r\nterrorism in particular. More than four decades ago, we\r\nin India established strict measures for the physical\r\nprotection of nuclear material during its use, storage\r\nand transport. A multidisciplinary expert group at the\r\nhighest level ensures that the appropriate measures are\r\nimplemented in that regard. Such measures are being\r\nappropriately upgraded through technological\r\nadvancements. In addition, an internal physical\r\nprotection advisory service exists. We have a specially\r\ndesigned human resource development programme to\r\ntrain personnel at various levels for that purpose.\r\nThe orphan sources in many countries have been\r\na cause of concern. We have collaborated with the\r\nAgency in providing indigenously developed\r\nequipment, including an aerial gamma-survey system,\r\nand the services of our experts for a ground and aerial\r\nsurvey to search for orphan sources in Georgia.\r\nWe are glad that the Agency is dealing with the\r\nissue of knowledge management. The gaining of\r\nnuclear knowledge in certain parts of the world is an\r\nimportant challenge. The nuclear knowledge pool in\r\nIndia is very large and is expanding in consonance with\r\nthe rapid growth of the country’s nuclear energy\r\nprogramme. One of the challenges that must be\r\naddressed by all of us who are engaged in nuclear\r\ntechnology development is to promote a knowledge-\r\nbased holistic approach across the entire spectrum of\r\nthe technology-society interface. Further, the linkage\r\namong society, industry and the national programme\r\nmust be visible to college students so that they\r\nrecognize that there are challenges that need solutions\r\nand are motivated to find them. We need to distinguish\r\nknowledge transfer from technology transfer, which\r\nhas obvious constraints that arise out of the commercial\r\ncontext. Knowledge, on the other hand, is enhanced by\r\nsharing it with worthy scholars who can sustain the\r\nprocess and also with those who can use it to find new\r\nsolutions of societal interest.\r\nI must emphasize that any technology will have\r\nits associated problems. However, the solutions to such\r\nproblems also lie in technology. In the evolution of\r\ncivilization, there have been several examples of\r\ntechnology allowing the enhancement of the quality of\r\nlife. In the process, some new issues of concern arose;\r\nhowever, such issues were satisfactorily resolved\r\nthrough the further application of technology. We have\r\nseen that in the context of energy, transportation,\r\nmaterial processing, food, human health and many\r\nother areas of human endeavour. Technological\r\nempowerment is thus the need of the hour. Continuity\r\nof nuclear knowledge and empowerment through\r\nnuclear technology to promote global peace and\r\nprosperity are our collective responsibility, and we can\r\nfulfil that responsibility through the unique\r\norganization of the IAEA.\r\nMr. De Alba (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nMexican delegation wishes to express its appreciation\r\nto Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and to\r\nall the Agency’s staff for their excellent work\r\nthroughout the year in order to accomplish the many\r\ntasks assigned to them by Member States and to\r\nconfront new challenges with limited financial\r\nresources.\r\nThe report of the IAEA’s activities in 2001 duly\r\nreflects the Agency’s achievements in promoting\r\ninternational cooperation in the peaceful uses of\r\nnuclear technologies and the transfer of those\r\ntechnologies to the developing countries, as well as its\r\nefforts to improve the effective regime of nuclear\r\nsafety and an efficient verification system.\r\nMexico welcomes the recent approval by the\r\nIAEA General Conference of the admission of Eritrea,\r\nKyrgyzstan and the Seychelles to membership of the\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nAgency, thus broadening the universal commitment to\r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We are also\r\npleased by the advances made in the strengthening of\r\nsafeguards, particularly with the approval of a\r\nconceptual framework for integrated safeguards and the\r\nimplementation of those safeguards on a priority basis\r\nin an effective and cost-efficient manner.\r\nAs regards physical safety and security, Mexico\r\nshares the international community’s concerns about\r\nmeasures to strengthen the Agency’s work aimed at\r\ncombating and preventing acts of nuclear terrorism. We\r\nwelcome the progress made to date through the\r\nadoption of an action plan to combat nuclear terrorism\r\nand through the establishment of a Nuclear Security\r\nFund through voluntary contributions. In this context,\r\nand in order to update harmonize views, Mexico is\r\nactively promoting the inclusion of ideas and\r\ndefinitions adopted in other international instruments\r\nwith respect to the definition of illicit conduct;\r\ncooperation in judicial matters and extradition; and the\r\ndevelopment of a draft protocol to amend the\r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear\r\nMaterial, a fundamental instrument for strengthening\r\nmeasures to prevent a terrorist act against nuclear\r\nmaterials and installations.\r\nWe also recognize the Agency’s efforts to\r\nimprove the quality and impact of the Technical\r\nCooperation Programme through the development of\r\nbetter projects in keeping with national priorities and\r\nwith enhanced socio-economic impact, promoting the\r\noptimal use of national and regional capacities. Mexico\r\nwelcomes the request made by the IAEA General\r\nConference to Mr. ElBaradei that enhanced efforts be\r\nmade to improve external contracting or subcontracting\r\nmechanisms so as to strengthen technical cooperation\r\namong developing countries.\r\nMexico is very pleased by the Agency’s progress,\r\nin particular with respect to the promotion of food\r\nsecurity, the management of water resources and\r\nimproved human health. These are clear illustrations of\r\nthe use of nuclear science and technology in support of\r\nsustainable development. Mexico welcomes the\r\napplication of sterile insect technologies because of\r\ntheir considerable effect on human, animal and plant\r\nhealth, with special emphasis on their technical and\r\neconomic viability. Mexico also believes that it is\r\nimportant to recognize the success of the application of\r\nisotopic techniques to the sustainable management of\r\nwater resources.\r\nWe believe that safety and security are among the\r\ntop priorities in the peaceful uses and applications of\r\nnuclear energy. Mexico participated in the second\r\nreview meeting of contracting parties to the\r\nConvention on Nuclear Safety, at which we submitted\r\nour national report. That report was welcomed by the\r\ncontracting parties, as it reflects the smooth\r\nfunctioning of the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant\r\nand the proper implementation of the Convention’s\r\nprovisions through our National Commission of\r\nNuclear Safety and Safeguards, Mexico’s nuclear\r\nregulatory agency.\r\nFinally, Mexico attaches great importance to the\r\nculture of security and, above all, prevention, as\r\nreflected in the Agency’s 2001 report, in which\r\nreference is made to the seminar on self-assessment\r\ntraining for a culture of safety and security, held under\r\nIAEA auspices at the Laguna Verde plant in June 2001.\r\nMr. Hidayat (Indonesia): I would like at the\r\noutset to express our appreciation to the Director\r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\n(IAEA), Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, for his introduction\r\nof the Agency’s report and the comprehensive\r\nstatement highlighting its role and activities.\r\nThe report portrays a wide range of scientific\r\nchallenges and how these are sought to be met through\r\nsafe and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It is\r\ngratifying to note that the Agency has continued its\r\ninvaluable contributions through the strategy of a\r\nunified approach to providing technical assistance,\r\nsafety measures and verification mechanisms. We are\r\nhopeful that its role in these endeavours will be further\r\nstrengthened in the future for the benefit of all States,\r\nespecially the developing countries.\r\nMy delegation wishes to emphasize the\r\nimportance of promoting a framework of confidence\r\nand cooperation within which the transfer of nuclear\r\ntechnology and materials for peaceful purposes can\r\ntake place, as they play an important role in catering to\r\nthe requirements of national development. This is\r\nessential even for countries that are endowed with\r\nabundant natural resources, both current and potential.\r\nEnergy has played and will continue to play a\r\nprincipal role in promoting economic and industrial\r\ngrowth, as well as improved human well-being.\r\nHowever, the substantial increase in global energy\r\nconsumption in the coming decades, which is foreseen\r\nin the Agency’s report, will be driven principally by the\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\ndeveloping world, especially in Asia, and it cannot be\r\nmet through resources that are finite. Hence, in our\r\nview, nuclear energy remains a strong option offering a\r\nsustainable energy future.\r\nIn some countries of the Asia-Pacific region,\r\nnuclear power is already an important contributor to\r\nelectricity generation and its role is projected to expand\r\nin order to support overall economic growth in the\r\nregion. This calls for enhanced technical cooperation to\r\nfacilitate the sustainable development of the\r\ndeveloping countries. It is therefore gratifying to note\r\nthat the transfer of nuclear science and technology to\r\nthose countries through cooperative programmes —\r\nespecially in areas such as food and agriculture,\r\nfighting disease, managing water resources and\r\nensuring environmental protection — continues to be a\r\nprincipal objective of the Agency.\r\nIndonesia has steadily supported the role of the\r\nIAEA in assisting States parties to launch projects\r\nwithin the framework of peaceful uses of nuclear\r\nenergy based on each country’s choices and decisions\r\nand the principle of sustainable development. Those\r\nactivities have facilitated a multiplicity of functions,\r\nmost notably the optimal utilization of resources, the\r\nplanning and implementation of nuclear power\r\nprojects, monitoring their performance, plant reliability\r\nand improving technical skills.\r\nAccording to the report, in the field of health,\r\nnuclear techniques have much to offer in the diagnosis\r\nand control of non-communicable diseases. New tools\r\nhave also come to be utilized for combating infectious\r\ndiseases. Nuclear and related biotechnologies can also\r\nfacilitate the achievement of food security and address\r\nproblems relating to malnutrition that afflict a large\r\nsegment of people living in the developing world.\r\nAs far as the aforementioned endeavours are\r\nconcerned, we gratefully acknowledge the Agency’s\r\nrole, among others, in organizing a regional technical\r\ncooperation project on nutritional studies with the\r\nparticipation of Indonesia and other members of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, which also\r\nhave availed themselves of the Agency’s nuclear safety\r\nreview services and assistance.\r\nThe question of ensuring a high level of nuclear\r\nsafety and security continues to be of critical\r\nimportance to the international community. An attack\r\non a nuclear power plant or other nuclear installation\r\ncould result in a massive release of radioactive material\r\nwith its attendant consequences. Such a dire prospect\r\nhas been further heightened by nuclear terrorism,\r\nwhich represents a potent danger to global peace and\r\nsecurity. The spectre that those weapons could fall into\r\nthe hands of terrorists demonstrates the priority that all\r\nnations must accord to that complex and interrelated\r\nissue.\r\nMy delegation is, therefore, gratified to note, in\r\nthat context, that the IAEA is already engaged in a\r\nwide range of activities pertinent to combating nuclear\r\nterrorism, including nuclear safety cooperation among\r\nrelevant organizations and member States, programmes\r\nto prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, as\r\nwell as other radioactive sources, and providing\r\nadvisory services against theft and sabotage.\r\nCurrently, the Agency is also considering\r\nexpansion of the scope and reach of its safety and\r\nsecurity services and undertaking a review of existing\r\nguidelines and conventions to ensure that they are\r\ncomprehensive and effective. Meanwhile, the\r\nestablishment of internationally agreed standards of\r\nsafety of nuclear installations, the coordination of\r\nefforts at the national, regional and global levels and\r\nthe fostering of information exchange have become\r\nimperative.\r\nThe Agency’s safeguards work as a worldwide\r\nsystem of monitoring and inspection of nuclear\r\nmaterials remains indispensable. States parties to the\r\nNPT and member States of the IAEA have addressed\r\nthe question of deficiencies through the “93 plus 2”\r\nprogramme of enhanced safeguards and have\r\nnegotiated an additional protocol, to which Indonesia\r\nhas been one of its early adherents.\r\nThe aforementioned programme extends the reach\r\nof the Agency’s inspectors beyond declared activities,\r\nrequires Governments to provide extensive information\r\non research and industrial activities, as well as on\r\nimports and exports of dual use technologies, and\r\nprovides the Agency with a comprehensive profile of a\r\ncountry’s nuclear activities, enabling IAEA to draw\r\nconclusions about its future intentions.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation recognizes the\r\nimportant role of the IAEA as an information source\r\nand as a substantial contributor to sustainable\r\ndevelopment. That has become essential in the context\r\nof expanding nuclear programmes in Asia. Innovative\r\nprojects are under way in many countries, under the\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nAgency’s auspices, that will identify promising\r\ntechnologies.\r\nAs in the past, the IAEA, within limited\r\nresources, has ensured the effective implementation of\r\na programme that made a constructive contribution to\r\nthe needs and interests of the developing nations. It\r\nalso has played an important role in assisting those\r\ncountries in improving their scientific and\r\ntechnological capabilities.\r\nMr. Santiago (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the countries of the\r\nCommon Market of the Southern Cone\r\n(MERCOSUR) — Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and\r\nUruguay — and the associated countries Bolivia and\r\nChile.\r\nI reiterate our satisfaction at seeing that the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continues\r\nto be a centre of excellence in promotional and security\r\nactivities. Our countries appreciate the relations they\r\nhave with the Agency and, thus, we congratulate\r\nDirector General Mohamed ElBaradei on his efficient\r\nguidance of the secretariat.\r\nThe technical cooperation activities promoted by\r\nthe IAEA have a positive impact on aspirations for\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. That is why our\r\ncountries stress the need to maintain a balance between\r\nthe Agency’s three main pillars. We attach great\r\nimportance to the potential of technical cooperation,\r\none of the Agency’s pillars, for supporting developing\r\ncountries in the various areas of applying scientific and\r\nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nWe highlight in particular a new IAEA-supported\r\ntechnical cooperation project designed to exploit and\r\nmanage water resources related to the Guarani aquifer\r\nsystem, involving Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and\r\nUruguay, aimed at expanding and preserving drinking\r\nwater resources.\r\nAlong other lines, our countries consider positive\r\nthe linkage of the IAEA with other multilateral\r\nspheres, particularly with the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. In that context, we recall the\r\nproject entitled Brazil: profile of a country in the\r\ndevelopment of sustainable energy, developed for the\r\nSummit by a committee of experts, in which IAEA\r\ntechnical personnel also participated.\r\nWe currently share the concern for the need to\r\nstrengthen efforts carried out by the Agency to\r\ncontribute preventing the possibility of terrorist acts\r\nagainst nuclear installations or their use of radioactive\r\nmaterial. In that regard, we express our readiness to\r\ncooperate in efforts to confront that threat.\r\nWe encourage the IAEA secretariat to develop\r\ninitiatives aimed at improving the level of security of\r\nnuclear installations, reactors and the fuel cycle, as\r\nwell as at issuing updated standards. We recognize that\r\nimportant progress has been made in the area of\r\nestablishing security standards.\r\nWe support in particular the development of the\r\nprogramme to improve the culture of security, for\r\nwhich our country is already serving as headquarters\r\nfor related activities. We also appreciate the great value\r\nof the services of assessment, review and diagnostic\r\nmissions related to nuclear security.\r\nSimilarly, and taking into account the fact that the\r\nMERCOSUR countries and Bolivia and Chile attach\r\nspecial importance to the secure transport of\r\nradioactive material, we recognize the progress made\r\nthrough IAEA General Conference resolutions and the\r\neffort made jointly by the member States and the\r\nsecretariat during 2001 regarding the revision of\r\nrelevant regulations, as well as action aimed at their\r\neffective incorporation by transport organizations.\r\nWe also observe with satisfaction that more\r\ncountries are using Transport Safety Appraisal Services\r\nassessment missions in implementing the Agency’s\r\ntransport regulations. We highlight in particular the\r\nevent that took place this year in Brazil.\r\nOur countries commit themselves to active\r\nparticipation in the 2003 International Conference on\r\nthe Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material.\r\nThe recent IAEA General Conference, held in\r\nSeptember, concluded with the adoption of a\r\nsignificant consensus on that subject. We hope that the\r\n2003 International Conference will achieve a similar\r\nlevel of understanding and dialogue.\r\nWith regard specifically to the progress made by\r\nthe secretariat in defining comprehensive safeguards,\r\nwe believe that efforts should be intensified, not only\r\nfor greater effectiveness, to prevent budgetary\r\npressures that produce imbalances in the exercise of the\r\nAgency’s statutory functions, but also for greater\r\nefficiency in verification activities.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nIn this regard, we also encourage the Agency to\r\nstep up its positive interaction with other verification\r\nbodies, such as the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for\r\nAccounting and Control of Nuclear Materials\r\n(ABACC), which has been operating for 10 years.\r\nABACC has been carrying out its verification\r\nactivities, within its area of application, with great\r\nsuccess. We believe that it is a great example of\r\ntransparency and we hope that its current cooperative\r\nrelationship with the IAEA will be intensified.\r\nFinally, with regard to the regular budget, we\r\nbelieve that any possible increases in contributions\r\nshould take into account the balance among the three\r\nbasic pillars of the Agency, as well as the specific\r\neconomic situation of our countries. The economic\r\nsituation in our region prevents our countries from\r\ntaking on heavy contribution burdens.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 14.\r\nI call on the representative of Kuwait who wishes\r\nto speak on a point of order.\r\nMs. Al Mulla (Kuwait): I would like to invoke\r\nrule 74 of the rules of procedure of the General\r\nAssembly, to call on the Assembly not to take action on\r\nthe amendment contained in draft resolution A/57/L.17.\r\nIn making this statement, my delegation is\r\nfollowing the precedent set last year by the\r\nrepresentative of Australia, as the Chairman of the\r\nBoard of Governors at the time. In view of the\r\nintensive and exhaustive process of consultations,\r\nwhich took place in Vienna and here in New York, and\r\nwhich resulted in broad agreement on the current text\r\nof the draft, it is the wish of the sponsors that the draft\r\nresolution be adopted as it stands.\r\nThe request for the motion is also based on the\r\nfollowing considerations. First, the amendment\r\ncontained in draft resolution A/57/L.17 refers to the\r\nannounced acceptance by Iraq of the unconditional\r\nreturn of inspectors. That matter has already been\r\naddressed in the preambular part of draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.14. Secondly, the latter part of the amendment\r\nrefers to an issue that has not been taken up by the\r\nAgency. The attention of delegates is drawn to the fact\r\nthat the draft resolution relates to the work of the\r\nAgency. Thirdly, the text of the latter part of the\r\namendment does not reflect in any way the language of\r\nresolution GC(46)/RES/15, as adopted by the General\r\nConference of the Agency last September. Indeed,\r\nmembers of the Agency are in general agreement that\r\nthe language in the draft resolution should faithfully\r\nreflect the language used in the resolutions of the\r\nGeneral Conference.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe representative of Iraq had the opportunity to\r\nsubmit amendments during the consultation process in\r\nVienna. This was done in an open-ended meeting, but\r\nthere was no support for the amendment submitted at\r\nthat time for the reasons that I mentioned earlier. In\r\nNew York, the representative of Iraq again presented\r\nthe amendment in draft resolution A/57/L.17, and an\r\nappeal was made for its withdrawal. As the appeal was\r\nnot heeded, we have had to resort to a motion that no\r\naction be taken. It is with regret that we do so. The\r\nmotion is not meant to deny any Members the right of\r\nexpression. It is meant to facilitate the adoption of the\r\ndraft resolution as it stands. We appeal to all Members\r\nto support the motion that no action be taken.\r\nThe President: The representative of Kuwait has\r\nmoved, within the terms of rule 74 of the rules of\r\nprocedure, that no action be taken on the amendment\r\ncontained in document A/57/L.17. Let me remind\r\nmembers that rule 74 reads:\r\n“During the discussion of any matter, a\r\nrepresentative may move the adjournment of the\r\ndebate on the item under discussion. In addition\r\nto the proposer of the motion, two representatives\r\nmay speak in favour of, and two against, the\r\nmotion, after which the motion shall be\r\nimmediately put to the vote.”\r\nDoes any representative wish to speak?\r\nI give the floor to the representative of Iraq.\r\nMr. Salman (Iraq): My delegation regrets that\r\nthere has been a request for a motion that no action be\r\ntaken. This would prevent a Member State from\r\nexpressing its views in a way that reflects the simple\r\ntruth, as expressed by the Secretary-General. We also\r\nregret that such practices are being tolerated in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The General Assembly was not\r\nfounded to rubber stamp to draft resolutions presented\r\nto it, but to ensure that Member States can fully\r\nexercise their rights, as enshrined in the Charter, thus\r\nensuring the transparency and credibility of this organ.\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nBefore action is taken, therefore, I would like to\r\nask delegations to consider the outcome of their vote in\r\nsetting a precedent on the future role of the Assembly. I\r\nkindly request the sponsors to reconsider their position.\r\nI would also like to remind Member States that the\r\nCharter provided for the right of substantive voting so\r\nas to ensure that Member States have the tools to\r\npresent their positions on matters dealt with in the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Taking this into account, I would\r\nlike to request delegations, regardless of their positions\r\nwith regard to the amendment that has been introduced,\r\nto vote against the motion for no action for the sake of\r\ntransparency and for the credibility of this organ.\r\nThe President: I shall now put to the vote the\r\nmotion submitted by the representative of Kuwait that\r\nno action be taken on the amendment contained in\r\ndocument A/57/L.17.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAndorra, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria,\r\nBelgium, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nBrazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Canada,\r\nChile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus,\r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic,\r\nEcuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Fiji, Finland,\r\nFrance, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy,\r\nJapan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia,\r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,\r\nMadagascar, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco,\r\nMozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand,\r\nNicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Papua New\r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland,\r\nPortugal, Republic of Korea, Republic of\r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, San\r\nMarino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands,\r\nSouth Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland, Thailand, the former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Tonga, Turkey, Uganda,\r\nUkraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania,\r\nUnited States of America, Uruguay, Yugoslavia\r\nAgainst:\r\nAlgeria, Belarus, Cuba, Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, Jordan, Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic,\r\nTunisia, Viet Nam, Yemen\r\nAbstaining:\r\nAngola, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh,\r\nBarbados, Brunei Darussalam, China, Egypt,\r\nGhana, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic\r\nRepublic of), Jamaica, Lesotho, Malaysia,\r\nMexico, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sierra Leone,\r\nSingapore, Sri Lanka, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nVenezuela\r\nThe motion for no action was carried by 86 votes\r\nto 11, with 26 abstentions.\r\nThe President: Since the motion for no action\r\nhas been adopted, no action will be taken on the\r\namendment contained in document A/57/L.17. We shall\r\ntherefore proceed to take a decision on draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.14.\r\nI shall call on those speakers wishing to speak in\r\nexplanation of vote before the vote.\r\nMr. Jon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea will reserve time to speak before the\r\nend of the discussion on this item, in order to explain\r\nits views and position on the nuclear issue in the\r\nKorean peninsula, in response to the statements made\r\nby several delegations this morning. Because of the\r\nstatements made, we cannot support the draft\r\nresolution. We will vote against draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.14.\r\nMr. Salman (Iraq): With regard to the decision\r\non the recent motion, my delegation has no other\r\nchoice than to ask for a separate vote on the twelfth\r\npreambular paragraph for the following reasons. First,\r\nit does not welcome Iraq’s decision of September to\r\nallow the unconditional return of the inspectors and the\r\nagreement with the Director-General of the IAEA on\r\nthe practical arrangements needed for the inspections.\r\nSecondly, it introduced new language that is meant to\r\naccommodate political aims that will serve aggressive\r\npolicies, taking into account that such language was\r\nnot included in last year’s resolution, before Iraq’s\r\ndecision to allow the inspectors to return. Thirdly, it\r\ndoes not refer to Iraq’s cooperation since 2000 with the\r\nIAEA in carrying out its mandate according to the\r\nsafeguards agreement. Having said that, I ask\r\ndelegations to vote against the twelfth preambular\r\nparagraph.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nexplanation of vote before the vote. Before proceeding,\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nI would like to announce that since the introduction of\r\nthe draft resolution, the following countries have\r\nbecome cosponsors of draft resolution A/57/L.14:\r\nArmenia, Belgium, Costa Rica, Estonia, the Former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Jordan and\r\nSwitzerland.\r\nA separate vote has been requested on the third\r\npreambular paragraph, the twelfth preambular\r\nparagraph, operative paragraph 5 and operative\r\nparagraph 10 of draft resolution A/57/L.14. Are there\r\nany objections to those requests? As there are none, we\r\nshall proceed accordingly.\r\nI now put to the vote the third preambular\r\nparagraph of draft resolution A/57/L.14. A recorded\r\nvote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, Australia,\r\nAustria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain,\r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium,\r\nBolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei\r\nDarussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi,\r\nCambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde,\r\nChile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia,\r\nCuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,\r\nDjibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,\r\nEl Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Fiji, Finland,\r\nFrance, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada,\r\nGuatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland,\r\nIndonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Ireland,\r\nItaly, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya,\r\nKuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania,\r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives,\r\nMali, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco,\r\nMongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar,\r\nNepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua,\r\nNigeria, Norway, Oman, Panama, Papua New\r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland,\r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of\r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, San\r\nMarino, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia,\r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain,\r\nSri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo,\r\nTonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey,\r\nUganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,\r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, United States of\r\nAmerica, Uruguay, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen,\r\nYugoslavia, Zambia\r\nAgainst:\r\nIndia, Israel\r\nAbstaining:\r\nGhana, Lesotho, Pakistan\r\nThe third preambular paragraph of draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.14 was adopted by 132 votes to\r\n2, with 3 abstentions.\r\nThe President: I shall now put to the vote the\r\ntwelfth preambular paragraph of draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.14.

57/9).\r\nThe President: I shall now call on those\r\nrepresentatives who wish to explain their votes on the\r\nresolution just adopted.\r\nMay I remind representatives that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Gosal (Canada): Canada voted in favour of\r\nresolution 57/9, entitled “Report of the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency”.\r\nWhile the resolution is, in fact, a report on the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)’s\r\nactivities for the last year, the report, unfortunately,\r\ndoes not reflect the most recent developments that have\r\noccurred, especially in regards to reports on the\r\nadmission by the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea about its undeclared uranium enrichment\r\nprogramme. It is for this reason that Canada does not\r\nbelieve that the thirteenth preambular paragraph and\r\noperative paragraph 11 accurately reflect the situation,\r\nwhich has evolved as of today.\r\nHowever, we acknowledge that the resolution was\r\ndrafted on the basis of consensus and that it only\r\nreflects developments which occurred up to 20\r\nSeptember 2002. It was on the basis of that consensus\r\nthat Canada was able to continue to accept the\r\nlanguage found in those paragraphs. However, we\r\nwould like to note that Canada will continue to support\r\nthe IAEA’s efforts to address these issues as quickly as\r\npossible.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nWith respect to the resolution as a whole, we\r\nbelieve that a shorter, more focused text that does not\r\nattempt to summarize the General Conference’s work\r\nshould be considered in the future.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nChina has consistently supported the work of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and\r\nappreciates the activities and achievements of the\r\nAgency in the past year. The Chinese delegation\r\ntherefore voted in favour of resolution 57/9 on the\r\nreport of the IAEA.\r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to explain its\r\nposition on the nuclear situation on the Korean\r\npeninsula. First, the principled position of the Chinese\r\nGovernment on this issue has not changed. We have\r\nalways believed that the process of denuclearization,\r\npeace and stability on the Korean peninsula should be\r\nmaintained. Secondly, concerned parties, on the basis\r\nof equality and mutual respect, should implement in\r\ngood faith agreements reached. Thirdly, We stand for a\r\npeaceful solution of related issues through dialogue\r\nand consultation.\r\nMr. Shringla (India): India, a founding member\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),\r\nattaches the highest importance and value to the\r\nobjectives of the Agency. Since resolution 57/9\r\npertains to the activities of the IAEA, we voted in its\r\nfavour.\r\nNonetheless, we have considerable difficulty with\r\nthe third preambular paragraph. The language of that\r\nparagraph appears to link adherence to the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\r\nthe freedom to develop research, production and use of\r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Article II of the\r\nStatute of the IAEA, which must guide all our\r\ndeliberations on the activities of the Agency, calls on\r\nthe Agency to\r\n“accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic\r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout\r\nthe world”.\r\nFurther, the Statute stresses the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of all its members. The purpose of\r\nthese provisions of the Statute of the IAEA is\r\nobviously to encourage the unfettered access of\r\nmember States to the peaceful uses of atomic energy\r\nwithout any discrimination whatsoever, albeit with\r\nappropriate safeguards.\r\nThe IAEA Statute predates the NPT and, besides,\r\nthe Agency has not been designated as a Secretariat of\r\nthe NPT. The Agency merely implements its safeguards\r\nfor different member States in accordance with their\r\nagreements, and the concept of safeguards itself\r\npredates the NPT. The NPT is not an equitable treaty.\r\nAlso the provisions of article VI of the NPT should not\r\nhave been fulfilled by the nuclear weapon States.\r\nTherefore the NPT should not be used for\r\ndiscriminating between members of the IAEA. By\r\ninferring that adherence by itself to the NPT, on which\r\nmy Government’s views are well known, would imply\r\naccess to peaceful uses of atomic energy, the resolution\r\ndeviates from, and in fact derogates from the objectives\r\nenshrined in the statute of the IAEA. We have,\r\ntherefore, been constrained to call for a vote on\r\npreambular paragraph 3 and I have voted against it.\r\nMr. Govrin (Israel): During the negotiations on\r\nthis resolution in Vienna, Israel made no secret that\r\nwhile supporting the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency (IAEA) annual report, it had reservations\r\nregarding certain paragraphs of this resolution,\r\nincluding operative paragraph 10. Israel stood ready to\r\ndiscuss the language of this paragraph and proposed\r\nalternative suggestions, but unfortunately, to no avail.\r\nTherefore, as it did last year, Israel lamentably had to\r\nvote against operative paragraph 10 of this resolution.\r\nIsrael believes that the language of operative\r\nparagraph 10 is clearly inconsistent with the consensus\r\nthat was reached over the past eight years in the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference on the resolution entitled\r\n“Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East”.\r\nIsrael strongly opposes the attempt to use the IAEA\r\nannual report in order to change the meaning of this\r\nconsensus resolution. I would like to remind\r\nrepresentatives that the consensus on the resolution\r\nwas difficult to establish in the first place and it has\r\nbeen maintained by preserving a delicately balanced\r\ntext that all parties could accept.\r\nOperative paragraph 10 of the resolution on the\r\nreport of the IAEA interrupts this balance. Taking\r\ncertain issues out of the overall context, while ignoring\r\nother elements of the consensus language, is bound to\r\njeopardize the spirit of consensus and will ultimately\r\nharm the credibility of the resolutions of the IAEA\r\nGeneral Conference.\r\nFor this reason Israel voted against operative\r\nparagraph 10 of this resolution. Israel has nevertheless\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nsupported the resolution as a whole out of recognition\r\nof the IAEA’s important role, especially when it comes\r\nto dealing with challenges to international security in\r\nthe nuclear domain. Israel can only hope that next year,\r\nthis unfruitful process of negotiations on this resolution\r\nwill be avoided.\r\nOn behalf of the State of Israel I would like to\r\ntake this opportunity to commend the IAEA Director\r\nGeneral for presenting the annual report of the Agency\r\nto the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Chaudhry (Pakistan): I have taken the floor\r\nto explain Pakistan’s position on the draft resolution\r\nentitled “Report of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency” as contained in document A/57/L.14. My\r\ndelegation has abstained on preambular paragraph 3\r\nand operative paragraph 5.\r\nThe language of preambular paragraph 3 links the\r\nright to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes with the\r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). We have always\r\nmaintained that this preambular paragraph on technical\r\nassistance should refer to the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) Statute only. Since Pakistan is\r\nnot a party to the NPT, we cannot accept any\r\ncommitment on its behalf.\r\nOur second concern is the operative paragraph 5,\r\non comprehensive safeguards, which we consider\r\ndiscriminatory and an attempt to keep developing\r\ncountries from acquiring nuclear technology for\r\npeaceful purposes. In our view, the IAEA’s role is to\r\nfacilitate technical safeguards and not indulge in taking\r\npolitical decisions. However, our policy for promoting\r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy has enabled us to vote\r\nin favour for the resolution as a whole.\r\nThe President: We have now heard the last\r\nspeaker in explanation of vote after the vote. A\r\nrepresentative has requested to express the right of\r\nreply. May I remind Members that statements in the\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to ten minutes\r\nfor the first intervention, and five for the second one,\r\nand should be made by the delegates from their seats.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Jon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea would like to state its position on\r\nthe so-called nuclear issue of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, in response to the statements made\r\nby the delegation of Denmark, who spoke on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, and the delegations of Japan,\r\nAustralia, the United States and South Korea.\r\nMy delegation would like, first, to point out that\r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is not a\r\nquestion to be dealt with at the United Nations or the\r\nIAEA, in view of its origin and substance. Solutions of\r\nany issue should be based on an objective and impartial\r\nanalysis of the essence of the issue, while looking for\r\nrealistic ways and means to address it.\r\nThe IAEA submits every year its annual report to\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly that contains\r\nstereotyped and unrealistic contents on the nuclear\r\nissue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nThe unilateral and coercive debate that is undertaken,\r\nas we see today, does not in any manner assist in\r\narriving at a proper solution.\r\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula\r\noriginated when the United States massively stockpiled\r\nnuclear weapons in South Korea and its vicinity,\r\nthreatening the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea. Against the background of the then-prevailing\r\ninternational political environment of the late 1980s\r\nand early 1990s, the United States raised the so-called\r\nnuclear doubt about our country with the aim of\r\ndestroying us. This issue is, in essence, a product of the\r\nhostile policy of the United States towards the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and, therefore,\r\nshould be resolved between the two countries.\r\nIn 1994, the Agreed Framework was signed\r\nbetween the two countries in order to address the\r\nnuclear issue, and the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea has been implementing it in good faith. If the\r\nAgreed Framework were to be implemented, it would\r\nautomatically follow that the safeguards agreement\r\nwould be carried out.\r\nUnder the Agreed Framework, we froze the\r\nnuclear facilities considered by the United States as its\r\nconcern. We continue to maintain the freeze and have\r\ncompleted the storage of spent fuel. Thus, we have\r\nlong ago carried out our obligations under the Agreed\r\nFramework. However, the United States is not carrying\r\nout any of its obligations under the Agreed Framework.\r\nUnder article 1 of the Framework, the United States is\r\nobliged to provide light water reactors to the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea by the year\r\n2003 in return for the freezing by the Democratic\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea of graphite moderated\r\nreactors and their related facilities.\r\nEight years have passed since we froze our\r\nnuclear facilities, but the United States has only\r\nrecently started the ground concrete tamping for the\r\nlight water reactor. Prospects for construction of the\r\nlight water reactor are very bleak. That will only result\r\nin our suffering an annual loss of 1,000 megawatts in\r\n2003, when the first light water reactor was scheduled\r\nto be completed, and in 2004, when the second light\r\nwater reactor was scheduled to be completed.\r\nThereafter, we will suffer an annual loss of 2,000\r\nmegawatts.\r\nUnder article 2 of the Framework, the two sides\r\nare obliged to move towards full normalization of their\r\npolitical and economic relations. Over the past eight\r\nyears, however, the United States has persistently\r\npursued its hostile policy towards the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and has maintained\r\neconomic sanctions against it. The United States has\r\ngone so far as to list the Democratic People’s Republic\r\nof Korea as part of the “axis of evil”.\r\nUnder article 3 of the Framework, the United\r\nStates is obliged to give formal assurances to the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea against the\r\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons. On the contrary, the\r\nUnited States has put our country on its list of targets\r\nfor a pre-emptive nuclear strike.\r\nUnder article 4 of the Framework, and in\r\nparagraph 7 of its confidential minutes, the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is to allow nuclear\r\ninspections only after the delivery of essential non-\r\nnuclear components for the first light water reactor\r\nunit, including turbines and generators, is completed.\r\nBut the United States has already come out with a\r\nunilateral demand for nuclear inspections and even\r\ncarries on a campaign to apply pressure on the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, misleading\r\ninternational opinion into thinking that we are violating\r\nthe Framework.\r\nThose are the prevailing circumstances\r\nsurrounding the so-called nuclear issue. Under those\r\ncircumstances, what is really the concern expressed by\r\nthose countries in their statements? Is it their concern\r\nat seeing the self-defensive capability to cope with the\r\ndirect threat and annihilation policy of the largest\r\nnuclear power? Is it their concern that we do our\r\nutmost to defend the sovereignty and the right to\r\nexistence of our nation and people? Is it their concern\r\nat witnessing opposition to high-handed behaviour and\r\na way of thinking based on power supremacy in\r\ninternational relations?\r\nThe fact that the United States lists our country as\r\na part of an axis of evil and as a target for a pre-\r\nemptive nuclear strike constitutes an open challenge to\r\nthat country’s obligations under the Agreed\r\nFramework. This amounts to the declared nullification\r\nof the Framework.\r\nBecause the United States has adopted the policy\r\nof launching a pre-emptive nuclear strike against our\r\ncountry, it has violated the basic spirit of the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It\r\nhas also made a dead letter of the inter-Korean joint\r\ndeclaration on the denuclearization of the Korean\r\npeninsula. The number one violator of the NPT is, in\r\nfact, the United States. That is the reality which is\r\nignored. It is unrealistic and unfair at this point to\r\nunilaterally urge implementation of the safeguards\r\nagreement.\r\nSince the United States threatens by force the\r\nsovereignty of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea as never before, politicizing the question of a\r\npre-emptive nuclear strike, and since the fate of the\r\nAgreed Framework is at the crossroads between life or\r\ndeath, we have recently put forward a proposal for\r\nconcluding a non-aggression treaty between the United\r\nStates and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nThis reflects the will and desire of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to end the grave situation\r\non the Korean peninsula and to safeguard the peace and\r\nsecurity of Korea and North-East Asia.\r\nWe urge the United States to give our proposal\r\nfurther serious consideration. It is a most reasonable\r\nand realistic proposal for resolving the nuclear issue\r\nagainst the backdrop of the prevailing situation in\r\nKorea. However, we note that the Bush administration\r\nrejects our proposal for a non-aggression treaty and,\r\ninstead, insists that we first scrap our so-called nuclear\r\nweapons programme. Rejection of the proposal to\r\nconclude a non-aggression treaty would mean that the\r\nUnited States has the intention of attacking the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, a\r\nsmall and divided country, values its sovereignty and\r\nright to existence more than life itself and regards the\r\nremoval of threats to its sovereignty and the right to\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nexistence as the criteria for settling all issues\r\nconcerning the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea.\r\nWe make it clear that the insistence of the United\r\nStates that we first scrap our nuclear weapons\r\nprogramme constitutes a direct threat to us, and it\r\nshould be kept in mind that this will inevitably spark a\r\nnew clash. If this is the case, we are compelled to\r\nexercise our power and are prepared to cope with that\r\nkind of situation.\r\nMy delegation draws the Assembly’s attention to\r\nthe fact that the United States has abruptly taken up the\r\nnuclear issue at the very point in time when relations\r\nbetween North and South Korea and between Japan and\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea are\r\ndeveloping positively.\r\nIt should be noted that one of the reasons why the\r\nUnited States abruptly raised the nuclear issue is to\r\ninterrupt the progress in relations between North and\r\nSouth Korea and between Japan and the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nNow the United States is trying to create an\r\natmosphere of pressure for the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea through its so-called policy\r\ncoordination with its allies. In this regard, we\r\nparticularly urge the countries neighbouring Korea not\r\nto follow blindly the United States policy on the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. It is necessary\r\nto have second thoughts: such blind action might do\r\nharm to themselves.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of the United States.\r\nMr. Michaels (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States has no nuclear weapons on the Korean\r\nPeninsula. We have no plans to place nuclear weapons\r\non the Korean Peninsula. We welcome a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free Korean Peninsula. Finally, we have no\r\nplans to attack North Korea. We seek a peaceful\r\nresolution to the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\r\nThe President: I understand that the\r\nrepresentative of the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea has asked for a second intervention in exercise\r\nof right of reply. Let me remind the representative that\r\nthe limit is five minutes.\r\nMr. Jon (Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea): If the United States wants in earnest the peace\r\nand security of the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it\r\nshould cease its hostile policy towards the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. The hostile policy towards\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is a full\r\nreflection of the pursuit by the United States of its\r\nunilateral interests in North-East Asia. As long as the\r\nhostile policy of the United States towards the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea persists, a\r\nsecond and third nuclear problem might arise at any\r\ntime, which the United States sees as necessary, and\r\npeace and security of the region would remain as\r\nelusive as ever.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 14?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 34\r\nThe situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.15/Rev.1)\r\nThe President: I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to introduce\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.15/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Kusljugić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): I\r\nshould like to announce that, since the publication of\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.15/Rev.1, the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors: Bulgaria, Canada, the\r\nCzech Republic, Finland, France, Hungary, Iceland,\r\nIreland, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Singapore,\r\nSweden and the former Yugoslav Republic of\r\nMacedonia.\r\nThere has not been a session of the General\r\nAssembly since 1992 on whose agenda my country has\r\nnot been an item, which indicates that it has been a\r\nmajor international problem. It is regularly discussed in\r\nthe context of the annual reports of the Office of the\r\nHigh Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees, the International Criminal Tribunal for the\r\nFormer Yugoslavia, the United Nations Mission in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) and several other\r\nannual reports. It is considered during Security Council\r\nmeetings, and resolutions concerning it are prepared\r\nand adopted annually.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nI should like to remind the Assembly why my\r\ncountry has been a major international problem for so\r\nlong. On 22 May 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nbecame a member of the United Nations family. By\r\nthat time, it was clear that the civilian population\r\nwould be the main victim of the aggression against the\r\nnew Bosnian State, since the first atrocities had already\r\noccurred. We in Bosnia and Herzegovina had expected\r\nthat the international community, represented in the\r\nUnited Nations, would react decisively and quickly to\r\nprevent the further suffering of civilians.\r\nUnfortunately, we waited for such action by the\r\ninternational community for more than three years.\r\nInstead of taking resolute action to stop the war, the\r\ninternational community decided to intervene with a\r\npeacekeeping force — the United Nations Protection\r\nForce — and to provide humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was called a\r\nproblem from hell, practically unsolvable. Indeed, we\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina were living in hell from\r\n1992 to 1995, but we did not think that the problem\r\nwas unsolvable. We knew that the root cause of the war\r\nwas the reappearance of extreme nationalism and\r\naggression against the Bosnian State, with the objective\r\nof destroying Bosnian multi-ethnic society and of\r\ncreating ethnically “pure” territories. We knew that the\r\nwar had been planned and ignited outside Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. We knew that the root cause of the\r\nconflict was not a historic and ancient hatred among\r\nBosnia’s ethnic groups, as enemies of the new Bosnian\r\nState claimed. Unfortunately, at the time, many in the\r\ninternational community did not understand or have the\r\nnecessary determination to stop the war and to prevent\r\nfurther atrocities. Recent trials at The Hague have\r\nproved that they were wrong, and we hope that the\r\ninternational community has learned a lesson in\r\nBosnia.\r\nHowever, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nhave paid a painful price for that lesson. The price paid\r\nby the Bosnian people is well known: more than 6 per\r\ncent of them were killed or are missing, and more than\r\nhalf were displaced. The worst European war crimes\r\nsince the end of the Second World War were committed\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the country’s physical\r\ninfrastructure and economy were destroyed. Dark\r\nsymbols of the suffering of the civilian population were\r\nethnic cleansing, detention camps, systematic mass\r\nrape, torture, besieged cities and, finally, the darkest\r\npage in human history, the genocide in the United\r\nNations “safe area” of Srebrenica. Despite all that,\r\nrecent developments in my country show substantial\r\nprogress in the process of rebuilding a multi-ethnic,\r\ndemocratic, sustainable and modern Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina that will be fully integrated into European\r\nstructures.\r\nI am pleased to announce, as we enter the second\r\ndecade of our full membership in the United Nations,\r\nthat Bosnia and Herzegovina will soon no longer be on\r\nthe agenda of United Nations bodies. The draft\r\nresolution on behalf of the Government of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina that is on the agenda today — the last one\r\nin a 10-year sequence — provides an overall picture of\r\nthe current situation and of progress achieved over the\r\npast year, and it contains recommendations for action\r\nin the near future.\r\nIn general, there has recently been significant\r\nprogress in the stabilization and normalization of the\r\nsituation in my country. That is a result of the joint\r\nefforts of Bosnia’s authorities and of representatives of\r\nthe international community. In the past year alone,\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina fulfilled the necessary\r\nconditions to become a member of the Council of\r\nEurope and joined that body; met the requirements of\r\nthe road map in order to sign a Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union;\r\nsuccessfully prepared and organized general elections\r\nfor the first time in its post-war history; promptly\r\nparticipated in global efforts against terrorism;\r\ndeveloped the State Border Service to its full capacity\r\nand substantially reduced illegal migration; further\r\nimproved bilateral relations with its neighbouring\r\ncountries, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia; signed bilateral free trade\r\nagreements with the countries involved in the Stability\r\nPact for South-Eastern Europe; and reduced its military\r\nassets and established the Standing Committee on\r\nMilitary Matters, with the objective of future admission\r\nto the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Partnership\r\nfor Peace programme. Additionally, the international\r\ncommunity successfully carried out the final activities\r\nof UNMIBH’s mandate, prepared arrangements for its\r\ntransition to the European Union Police Mission and\r\nreorganized its work by adopting a more efficient,\r\nstreamlined organizational model.\r\nWe consider the progress achieved last year as\r\nonly one phase in the long-term transitional process\r\nfrom war to peace, from a destroyed economy to\r\nsustainable development and from war-torn State\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nstructures to sustainable, modern and efficient State\r\ninstitutions. I should now like to focus on the major\r\nproblems that remain.\r\nThe General Framework Agreement for Peace in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, also known as the Dayton-\r\nParis Peace Agreement, is a legally binding document\r\nthat sets out principles for the future organization of\r\nthe State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, in the\r\nseven years since it was signed, it has been used more\r\nas a tool of obstructionists to stop the State’s progress\r\nand to impede the development of common State\r\ninstitutions than as a foundation that can be further\r\nbuilt upon for the benefit of the entire country and its\r\npeople. Further development of political structures, in\r\naccordance with European human rights standards and\r\nwith the requirements of Euro-Atlantic associations, is\r\none of our most urgent priorities.\r\nThe problem of indicted war criminals who are\r\nstill at large after seven years remains a painful and\r\nfrustrating issue that burdens my country’s past and\r\nclouds its future. Reconciliation and confidence-\r\nbuilding will not be possible unless the individuals\r\nresponsible for atrocities and genocide are tried and\r\nsentenced. The fact that such individuals are being\r\nsheltered in the neighbouring country only aggravates\r\nthis matter and raises doubts regarding their desire for\r\ngood neighbourly relations.\r\nMiss Clarke (Barbados), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nA major remaining priority is to establish the rule\r\nof law. We realize that the corruption and the lack of\r\ntransparency seriously hamper economic development\r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we expect that the\r\nrestructured police and judiciary system will combat\r\ncorruption and other illegal activities more\r\nsuccessfully. The long overdue process of restructuring\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina’s court system at all levels,\r\nthe establishment of the State Court, the further\r\ndevelopment of sustainable law enforcement structures,\r\nbased on the foundations laid by the United Nations\r\nMission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are some of the\r\npriorities in this sector.\r\nThe economy of the country is in a poor state,\r\nand unless it is given new life by fresh venture capital,\r\nit might present a source of instability in the future.\r\nThe authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina are\r\ndetermined to create a self-sustainable, market-oriented\r\neconomy, operating in a single economic space, to\r\ncomplete as soon as possible the process of\r\nprivatization, further improve banking and capital\r\nmarkets, reform financial systems, and provide\r\nadequate social protection. The recently adopted “Jobs\r\nand Justice” program makes a good foundation and\r\ngives hopes that an environment making possible the\r\ninflow of foreign investment and an outburst of private\r\ninitiative will shortly be created.\r\nEven though refugees have been returning and\r\nproperty restored in recent years, we should not lose\r\nmomentum. It is evident that security has been\r\nimproved significantly throughout the country.\r\nHowever, the fulfilment of Annex VII of the Peace\r\nAgreement is another task, closely linked to the\r\nsuccess of the economic recovery and establishing the\r\nrule of law.\r\nCorruption, organized crime and illegal criminal\r\nactivities seriously hamper improvement in all the\r\npreviously mentioned areas. Criminal networks operate\r\non a regional basis; they have neither nationality nor\r\nreligion. My country will spare no effort to capture\r\nthose individuals or groups of individuals and it is\r\nready to cooperate with neighbouring countries,\r\ncountries in the region and the international community\r\nto complete this task. In this context, I would like to\r\nmention that the ill repute, recently brought upon my\r\ncountry by disregarding United Nations Security\r\nCouncil resolutions is also the fault of irresponsible\r\nindividuals, essentially criminals, who will be brought\r\nto justice.\r\nThe implementation of necessary structural\r\nreforms, intended to solve the mentioned problems,\r\nwill require assistance from the international\r\norganizations that are willing to participate and to aid.\r\nThe Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is\r\ncommitted to working together with the international\r\ncommunity to fulfil the vision of developing a modern,\r\ndemocratic, multiethnic, viable European country. It is\r\non the basis of that vision that we face the important\r\nchallenges and tremendous tasks ahead of us.\r\nI would also like to announce the revision of the\r\ndraft resolution (A/57/L.15/Rev.1) in operative\r\nparagraph 7. The paragraph should start with “notes”\r\ninstead of “also welcomes”.\r\nMr. Moesby (Denmark): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The countries\r\nof Central and Eastern Europe associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia,\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia, Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, and the European Free\r\nTrade Association countries of the European Economic\r\nArea Norway and Iceland align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nLast month the High Representative, Paddy\r\nAshdown, briefed the Security Council on his efforts to\r\nassist the reform process. His briefing reinforced the\r\nimpression of continued progress in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, but at the same time stressed that there\r\nare still major tasks to be accomplished in the coming\r\nmonths. The European Union has already welcomed\r\nprogress in relation to the “Road Map”, the first step in\r\nthe EU Stabilisation and Association Process for\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Accelerated reform in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina would undoubtedly put the country on\r\nthe road to further European integration.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina went to the polls on 5\r\nOctober. Seven years after the signing of the Dayton\r\nPeace Agreement, politicians were elected for the first\r\ntime for a period of four years. It was also the first time\r\nthe authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina assumed\r\nresponsibility for the election process themselves. The\r\nEuropean Union commends the electoral authorities for\r\ntheir professional organization of the elections, which\r\nwere carried out in a peaceful manner.\r\nAt the same time the European Union regrets the\r\nlow participation in the elections. The High\r\nRepresentative characterized it as a protest vote. The\r\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina have shown their\r\ndisappointment with the inadequate progress towards\r\ngenerating change and building a better future. It is a\r\ncall for a more efficient political system and faster\r\neconomic and social reforms. Thus, the European\r\nUnion urges the rapid formation of effective\r\ngovernments genuinely committed to increasing the\r\npace of the reform process. The European Union would\r\nlike to reconfirm its strong commitment to actively\r\nassisting Bosnia and Herzegovina in this effort.\r\nTo a much greater extent than before all countries\r\nin the region should take responsibility for their own\r\ndevelopment. This applies to Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nas well. With aid falling, and debt mounting, economic\r\nreforms have become more urgent than ever to attract\r\nmuch-needed foreign investments to fill the gap. The\r\nEuropean Union, together with other institutions and\r\nfora, such as the Stability Pact, has given considerable\r\nsupport to the reform process in the region.\r\nPolitical elites as well as the general public have\r\nto identify with the reform processes bringing them\r\ncloser to Europe. Institution-building must be\r\nstrengthened and the local level should be involved in\r\nthe reform process in a more effective way.\r\nFurthermore, greater emphasis should be given to civil\r\nsociety, especially youth and women and their\r\nparticipation in society, politics, and education. The\r\ninternational community must continue to support this\r\nprocess.\r\nThe existence of organized crime and corruption\r\nprevents the roots of progress and democratic\r\ndevelopments from taking hold. Organized crime is a\r\nthreat to the rule of law, to democracy and human\r\nrights as well as to social progress and economic\r\nreform. It is a threat to security and stability. Unless\r\nthese destructive structures are broken down the\r\ninternational efforts to promote democracy and\r\neconomic development will not be sustainable.\r\nThe fight against organised crime in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and the Western Balkans as a whole is\r\ntherefore high on the agenda for the European Union.\r\nTogether with the United Kingdom, the European\r\nUnion is preparing a Conference on Organized Crime\r\nin South Eastern Europe. The conference will take\r\nplace in London on 25 November and will be a good\r\nopportunity for the countries in the region to make\r\ncommitments within existing mechanisms and to set\r\nclear targets in the fight against organized crime.\r\nThe international community has identified the\r\nfollowing priority areas as crucial for the reform\r\nprocess in Bosnia and Herzegovina: rule of law,\r\ninstitution building and the economy, as well as the\r\nreturn of refugees and reconstruction. The former High\r\nRepresentative, Ambassador Wolfgang Petritsch,\r\nsuccessfully promoted those priorities and the\r\nEuropean Union would like to thank him for his\r\nextraordinary commitment to the development of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIt is now crucial to invigorate the pace of reform.\r\nStrengthening the rule of law is an essential part of the\r\ndemocratisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nDeveloping a well-functioning judiciary and State\r\nadministration are prerequisites for the stability of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. The European Union fully\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nsupports High Representative Paddy Ashdown in his\r\n“Justice and Jobs” programme, and we commend the\r\nresults already achieved in this field. Reform in the\r\neconomic sector is key to prosperity for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, in particular with a view to creating jobs\r\nand raising personal income. This will lead to tangible\r\nimprovements in living standards. Restarting the\r\neconomy and creating sustainable development through\r\nthe adoption of structural reforms should be a priority\r\nin the work of the future Government. The\r\nimplementation of these reforms will be a precondition\r\nfor continued international financial assistance.\r\nThe rule of law approach also includes full\r\ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal\r\nfor the former Yugoslavia by all States and parties of\r\nthe region. This constitutes a non-negotiable\r\nrequirement of international law. In this regard, access\r\nto witnesses and archives is essential.\r\nThe European Union remains determined that all\r\nthose indicted for war crimes should be brought to\r\njustice. The continuing impunity of persons indicted on\r\nvarious counts of genocide must end. The Government\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as of both entities\r\nmust spare no effort to locate, arrest and transfer such\r\npersons to the custody of the International Tribunal.\r\nThe European Union has with great concern\r\nlearned of the arms exports from Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina through the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia to Iraq. This is a violation of United\r\nNations sanctions and demands a swift response from\r\nthe authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina at both the\r\nState and entity level. The current investigations have\r\nillustrated the need for an accelerated defence reform\r\nand a transfer of competencies for arms exports from\r\nthe entity to the State level. The recent commitment of\r\nthe authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to take\r\naction in this regard is a step forward which will\r\nrequire immediate implementation. The European\r\nUnion would like to underline the crucial importance\r\nof establishing State-level control over the export of\r\nmilitary weapons and equipment.\r\nThe European Union emphasizes the need for a\r\nsustainable solution to the issue of displaced persons.\r\nIn recent years there has been a steady improvement in\r\nthe return figures. In 2002 alone there have been more\r\nthan 60,000 registered returns, resulting in a total of\r\nalmost 900,000 returnees. But still more needs to be\r\ndone in order to create a favourable climate for\r\nreturnees. The European Union therefore strongly\r\nregrets local obstruction to returns and urges all\r\nauthorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to honour their\r\ncommitment to address outstanding legal and\r\nadministrative issues in this regard. The adequate\r\nattribution of resources by the Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nauthorities towards the sustainability of the process of\r\nthe return of refugees and internally displaced persons\r\nis of utmost importance.\r\nThe European Union noted with satisfaction that\r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina (UNMIBH) has been prolonged until\r\nthe end of the year. UNMIBH has now, after seven\r\nyears, successfully fulfilled its mandate in the area of\r\npolice reform and restructuring. The prolongation will\r\nensure an orderly transition to the European Union\r\nPolice Mission, which will take over on 1 January\r\n2003. I am happy to inform the Assembly that the\r\nStatus of Forces Agreement between the European\r\nUnion and Bosnia and Herzegovina was signed in\r\nSarajevo last month, enabling the EU Police Mission to\r\ntake over when the United Nations Mission ends its\r\nwork.\r\nIn this context, the European Union would like to\r\nstress the importance of enhanced cooperation and\r\ncoordination among different international actors in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. Through the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Process and the EU Police Mission, the\r\nEuropean Union will continue to work with the\r\nauthorities and the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nin their endeavours to build a well-functioning multi-\r\nethnic society.\r\nMr. Kulyk (Ukraine): Only a few weeks ago, the\r\nSecurity Council and interested Member States heard\r\nan open briefing on current political developments in\r\nthe country by the High Representative, Paddy\r\nAshdown, and the Secretary-General’s Special\r\nRepresentative, Mr. Jacques Paul Klein.\r\nTheir key common message was distinct enough.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina remains on the right path.\r\nThere may be some bumps in the road, but the\r\ndirection is clear.\r\nNext week will mark the seventh year since the\r\nend of the war in Bosnia. It is obviously more difficult\r\nto organize peace than to win a war. The very fact that\r\nwe all — Bosnia and Herzegovina, together with the\r\ninternational community — have succeeded in going\r\nthis far in implementing the Dayton-Paris Peace\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nAgreement is indeed evidence of the viability of its\r\ndesign and of the realistic approach taken to its\r\nrealization.\r\nPeace has taken root within the country. Nearly a\r\nmillion refugees have returned to their homes; tangible\r\nprogress has been made in the consolidation of State\r\ninstitutions; positive changes are visible in the\r\neconomic sphere; a comprehensive reform of the\r\njudicial system has been instituted; the police and\r\narmed forces are being overhauled; the number of\r\nillegal migrants is down; and the overall crime rate has\r\nbeen reduced.\r\nHowever, this list of practical successes is far\r\nfrom exhaustive. The recent accession of Sarajevo to\r\nthe Council of Europe is proof of the encouraging\r\nchanges on the ground. We believe that the\r\ninvolvement of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the process\r\nof European integration is the only way to finally\r\novercome the consequences of war.\r\nIn this regard, it is important for the international\r\ncommunity to send a strong message to the winners of\r\nthe 5 October general elections that their victory\r\nmeans, first and foremost, the additional responsibility\r\nof making progress in pursuit of the reforms. We\r\ncongratulate the Bosnian authorities on the impressive\r\njob they did in ensuring the democratic, free and fair\r\ncharacter of the elections, and we join those\r\ndelegations that believe that the results of those\r\nelections reflect the will to speed up substantially the\r\npace of political and economic transformation.\r\nThe newly elected leaders should now\r\ndemonstrate in practice their readiness to fulfil the\r\nresponsibilities that have been entrusted to them.\r\nIn a broader international context, such a task\r\nrequires further steps to strengthen regional stability.\r\nMy country warmly welcomes the results of the\r\ntrilateral summit of the heads of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Yugoslavia and Croatia, held in Sarajevo\r\non 15 July 2002, and notes with satisfaction the\r\ndevelopment of active cooperation among those\r\ncountries. We encourage our partners to continue and\r\nenhance this vital trend.\r\nThe ambitious reform plan recently presented by\r\nPaddy Ashdown should provide the Bosnian leaders\r\nwith a clear vision of the concrete steps that need to be\r\ntaken immediately.\r\nMy delegation endorses the High\r\nRepresentative’s six priority tasks for further reform in\r\nthe coming six months. The strengthening of the rule of\r\nlaw and the advancement of economic reforms must\r\nremain key elements of the recovery strategy for\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAlong with other urgent issues, we wish to\r\nreaffirm the importance of ensuring national minority\r\nrights in the country. The Ukrainian community is the\r\nfourth-largest ethnic group in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nAt present, there is a further need to improve the\r\nconditions for their national and cultural revival.\r\nMy delegation calls upon the Bosnian authorities\r\nto continue their efforts to protect minority rights. We\r\nalso hope that the new law on national minorities in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina will become a practical and\r\nuseful instrument that will allow minorities to exercise\r\ntheir rights according to European standards.\r\nSeven years of the United Nations Mission in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina are about to end. On behalf of\r\nthe Government of Ukraine, I would like to pay tribute\r\nto the men and women of the Mission, led by Special\r\nRepresentative Jacques Paul Klein. We commend the\r\npositive results achieved by the Mission in the areas of\r\npolice reform, police restructuring, institution-building\r\nand inter-police-force cooperation.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the practical goals\r\ndetermined by UNMIBH will be successfully\r\nimplemented by the EU follow-on mission.\r\nThe intention of the European Union to make a\r\nleading contribution to the streamlining of the overall\r\ncivilian and police presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nis a fundamental step, which should accelerate further\r\npositive changes in that country.\r\nHaving already expressed our interest in being\r\ninvolved in the EU-led military crisis-management\r\noperations and in processes related to the European\r\nsecurity and defence policy, including its military and\r\ncivilian aspects, my Government reiterates its readiness\r\nto contribute to the EU Police Mission.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing my country’s\r\nutmost support for the intense efforts of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to build a democratic and prosperous\r\nsociety, with respect for the rule of law and for the\r\nrights of each and every citizen. We remain committed\r\nto achieving these goals and intend to continue our\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nactive participation in international efforts aimed at\r\nbringing peace and stability to the country.\r\nMr. Bozay (Turkey): Turkey aligns itself with the\r\nstatement already made by the representative of\r\nDenmark on behalf of the European Union. I shall\r\ntherefore confine myself to commenting briefly on\r\nthose points which have particular importance as seen\r\nfrom the perspective of my country.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to remind this body\r\nthat Turkey, which is also a Balkan country, has always\r\nbeen directly involved in efforts geared towards the\r\nestablishment of peace and stability in the region.\r\nFostering friendly relations and cooperation among the\r\ncountries of the Balkans has been, and remains, the\r\nmost reliable and productive avenue to this end. Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina has been at the forefront of our\r\nconcerns, given our shared history and the ties we have\r\nwith that country.\r\nAs a member of the Steering Board of the Peace\r\nImplementation Council, Turkey is a strong supporter\r\nof the key strategic targets set by that body. The\r\nconsolidation of state institutions, the pursuit of\r\neconomic reform and the return of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons are therefore the main\r\npriorities of my country in reviewing the situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nWe note the considerable achievements in all of\r\nthese areas, as well as the serious challenges that\r\nremain, as Bosnia moves towards European integration,\r\nwhich is its destiny. Reconciliation among the\r\nconstituent people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is\r\na prerequisite for sustainable stability and development\r\nin the country, must continue.\r\nEarlier Governments endeavoured to achieve such\r\nreconciliation by political, judicial and economic\r\nreform. Unfortunately, a commonly agreed and\r\ncoherent agenda in pursuing these reforms was lacking.\r\nThis had negative repercussions on the daily lives of\r\nBosnians, who understandably manifested their\r\ndissatisfaction through the low level of their\r\nparticipation in the elections and the level of the\r\nprotest vote.\r\nIn this vein, Turkey supports the “Justice and\r\nJobs” programme of the High Representative, Paddy\r\nAshdown, which is a well-designed agenda for\r\npursuing those reforms. We call upon the newly elected\r\nrepresentatives of Bosnia to form a Government at the\r\nearliest opportunity in order to engage themselves in\r\nthis agenda. The Bosnian people are waiting for that,\r\nand as Lord Ashdown suggested in his recent report to\r\nthe Secretary-General, the international community\r\nwill also judge the incoming Governments at the State\r\nand entity level by their commitment to reform. The\r\ninherent message of the protest votes is clear: Bosnians\r\nwant reform.\r\nThe priorities of the international community in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina are justice, and then jobs,\r\nthrough reform. This being understood, the\r\ninternational community has put its efforts on a new\r\nfooting, placing a new emphasis on the rule of law. The\r\nentrenched power structures in various cantons, cities\r\nand public enterprises are among the main obstacles to\r\nestablishing the true rule of law in Bosnia. The new\r\nGovernments at the State and entity level should work\r\nin earnest to eliminate these power structures and fully\r\ncooperate with the international presence in Bosnia to\r\nthis end.\r\nIn the same vein, the Government should\r\nthoroughly implement economic reforms, which will\r\nstimulate domestic production and foreign investment,\r\nand pursue effective policies for collecting or\r\ngenerating sufficient revenue. This is vital with regard\r\nto the “jobs” dimension of Lord Ashdown’s agenda,\r\nand it is necessary in order to convince the\r\ninternational community that its financial assistance\r\nwill be efficiently utilized within the framework of\r\nreform.\r\nOne of the serious hurdles for the justice and jobs\r\ndimension of the reform agenda is the situation of the\r\nindicted war criminals. We welcome the fact that so far\r\na considerable number of them have been apprehended.\r\nMany are still at large, however. On this matter, we\r\nneed the cooperation of the respective Governments.\r\nInter-ethnic respect and confidence need to be\r\nconsolidated by bringing to justice Radovan Karadzic\r\nand Ratko Mladic. Moreover, they are still casting dark\r\nshadows upon political and economic life in Bosnia,\r\nand might endanger the overall reform agenda of the\r\nHigh Representative.\r\nThe return of refugees and internally displaced\r\npersons is the litmus test of the Dayton Accords.\r\nImproved security conditions, a more cooperative and\r\nreceptive political mind-set, which is lacking in some\r\nareas, as well as countrywide implementation of\r\nproperty legislation, may positively affect the returns.\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nAs I say this, I am well aware of the vital need for the\r\nsuccess of the economic reforms in Lord Ashdown’s\r\nprogrammes in order to achieve a meaningful number\r\nof returns.\r\nIn tackling those challenges, I believe that in the\r\nfuture we should not shy away from commending those\r\nparties in Bosnia and Herzegovina that cooperate. That\r\nwould be a sign of international support for those\r\nparties and would also serve to encourage them to stay\r\non a prudent path.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the last paragraph\r\nof draft resolution A/57/L.15, entitled “The Situation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina”, requests the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to prepare a comprehensive report on the\r\nUnited Nations activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\ncovering the period 1992-2002. We look forward to\r\nseeing that report, as it will give us a chance to review\r\nthe lessons learned as well as the best practices from\r\nthe United Nations experience in Bosnia.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our appreciation to Mr. Jacques Paul Klein,\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General and\r\nCoordinator of the United Nations Operations in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, for the tremendous job he has\r\ndone there. We hope that the European Union Police\r\nMission will carry the flag of success that the United\r\nNations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved\r\nunder the able administration of Mr. Klein.\r\nIn the history of Bosnia, bridges mean more than\r\ntheir physical function might suggest. They have now\r\nbecome symbols of reconciliation, and the constituent\r\npeople of Bosnia and Herzegovina would like them to\r\nremain intact. At this important stage of Bosnian\r\npolitics, the international community should keep in\r\nmind that there is still a need to help Bosnians to\r\nrebuild the old bridges that span rivers and hearts. Such\r\nbridges are not only the physical structures across the\r\nNeretva, Bosna, Una, Drina and Sava rivers, but, more\r\nimportantly, the social, political and economic bridges.\r\nTo be more precise, economic and judicial reform,\r\nbuilding State institutions and ensuring the speedy\r\nreturn of refugees and displaced persons will serve as\r\nthe cement that strengthens the true bridges that\r\nconnect the hearts and minds of the Bosnian people.\r\nMs. Ognjanovac (Croatia): Croatia remains\r\nvitally interested in developments in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. The fact that Croats are one of the three\r\nconstituent peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not\r\nthe only reason for our interest. The stability of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina has direct relevance to the stability\r\nand, moreover, the prosperity of Croatia itself. The\r\nshape and length of our country’s border with Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina alone supports this argument. Both\r\ncountries rely heavily on each other’s traffic\r\ninfrastructures and are important trade partners. It is\r\ntherefore quite clear why my Government firmly\r\nsupports a stable and politically, institutionally and\r\neconomically self-sustainable Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nIt is encouraging to see that most, if not all, of the\r\npolitical parties that participated in the recent elections\r\nexpressed their will to live in a common State, and to\r\ncontribute to its prosperity. The political parties that\r\nwon the majority of the voters’ support deserve to be\r\ngiven a chance to prove their trustworthiness. If there\r\nis something that may be taken as worrisome, it is\r\nprobably the low voter turnout. Only 55 per cent of the\r\nelectorate voted, a figure very similar to that of those\r\nwho voted in Serbia’s presidential election. Surely that\r\nis an indicator of resignation and fatigue.\r\nFor some time, Croatia has been drawing the\r\nattention of the international community to the main\r\ncontradiction within Bosnia and Herzegovina’s\r\nconstitutional structure, namely, the integrity of the\r\ncountry on the one hand, and its de facto partition on\r\nthe other. Dayton tried to reconcile the peoples of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina through pledges to create joint\r\ninstitutions that, in turn, were to secure their respective\r\nbasic interests and preserve the values of a multiethnic\r\nsociety. The pledge to reverse ethnic cleansing and\r\nrestore the pre-war demographic composition fed\r\npeople’s hopes and raised expectations.\r\nAt the same time, Dayton did not provide any\r\nguidance about how to manage the built-in conceptual\r\ncontradiction of the peace agreement. The Croats, as\r\nthe smallest constituent nation, cannot rely on the same\r\nfactors as the other two constituent nations to protect\r\ntheir identity and interests, such as size and a separate\r\nentity. Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina can lend their\r\ntrust only to a political system that guarantees them the\r\npreservation of their national, cultural and religious\r\nidentity, and allows them to be genuinely represented\r\nin all joint institutions.\r\nThe present constitutional arrangement is the one\r\nthat could be agreed upon by all sides at the time it was\r\nnegotiated. Even though it has not been fully\r\nimplemented, it has served the primary purpose of the\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nPeace Accord, that is, to stop the bloodshed. The\r\nconstitutional structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nmust continue to develop and evolve with the dynamics\r\nof the country’s political, economic and social life.\r\nThat is the road to a democratic and self-sustainable\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. As the High Representative\r\ncorrectly observed in one of his recent speeches,\r\nDayton is the floor and not the ceiling.\r\nCooperation with the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is one of the\r\nobligations that parties to the Dayton Agreement\r\nundertook when signing the Agreement. A major\r\nbreakthrough has been made with the arrest of\r\nSlobodan Milosevic and with the indictments against\r\nhim being extended to the crimes committed in Croatia\r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina. The indictments will\r\nbring justice for the victims, and also serve the\r\nestablishment of historical records concerning the\r\nevents in the former Yugoslavia. Consequently, this\r\nwill ultimately benefit reconciliation among the people\r\nof the region.\r\nOn a more sombre note, we simply cannot accept\r\nthat two of the most wanted indictees —\r\nMessrs. Karadzic and Mladic — are still at large. We\r\nsincerely hope that their time is finally running out,\r\nand that those who are in a position to arrest them will\r\ndo so. There can be no sustainable Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina with Karadzic and Mladic at large.\r\nWhat is it that needs to be done to put Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina irreversibly onto the road to statehood as\r\na member of the European Union, as Lord Ashdown so\r\neloquently put it recently? The reform proposals\r\nrecently made by the High Representative are very well\r\nfounded and deserve to be seriously considered.\r\nStrengthening the role of the State, reducing the\r\ncomplexity of the administrative system and ensuring a\r\nmerit system in the selection and job security of civil\r\nservants are some of the measures that deserve our\r\nattention.\r\nThe justice system should definitely be among the\r\npriorities. Many countries in transition are plagued\r\nwith corruption, and Bosnia and Herzegovina is no\r\nexception. Victory over this disease will create\r\nfavourable conditions for foreign direct investment,\r\nand will benefit the country in the long run.\r\nWe also hope that authorities in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina will find incentives for young people to\r\nremain in the country and to attract those who are\r\nwilling to come back from abroad. Fresh ideas,\r\ninnovation and open minds are only a few of the many\r\nbenefits that young generations bring.\r\nMembership in the Council of Europe represents\r\na good starting point for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the\r\nprocess that should eventually culminate in European\r\nUnion membership. We will do our utmost to provide\r\nhelp and assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nbecause we need a stable neighbour and partner we can\r\ncount on in our common European future.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): Slovenia fully associates\r\nitself with the statement made earlier by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Denmark on behalf of the European\r\nUnion.\r\nHaving been actively engaged in the international\r\ncommunity’s efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina since\r\nthe beginning, I would like to express some additional\r\nviews in my national capacity.\r\nWe consider today’s debate as an important and\r\nappropriate occasion to give new impetus to\r\ninternational efforts to build a prosperous, stable and\r\nEuropean-oriented Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina stands at an important juncture in the\r\nprocess of consolidating its State. It should\r\ncontinuously demonstrate its determination to create a\r\nmodern European State with effective government,\r\nstable institutions and rising standards in public life.\r\nToday’s Bosnia and Herzegovina faces some\r\narduous tasks: strengthening the rule of law, creating a\r\nstable and friendly economic environment and fighting\r\nthe corruption and organized crime that distort the path\r\nof economic and political development. The authorities\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina will have to work hard and\r\nwith strengthened responsibility to meet the challenges\r\nahead. Not only will they have to work hard to meet\r\nthe requirements and expectations of the international\r\ncommunity, they will first have to meet the\r\nexpectations of their own peoples. Yet, the challenges\r\nconfronting Bosnia and Herzegovina remain too\r\nnumerous to be faced alone. International assistance is\r\nstill needed.\r\nThe experience of the international community in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina shows that much progress has\r\nalready been achieved. Slovenia welcomes the active\r\nrole of the international community in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina and considers that a continued\r\ninternational presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nvital to achieving the aims that the international\r\ncommunity set out seven years ago.\r\nThe departure of the United Nations Mission in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) should not serve\r\nto scale down the international community’s political\r\nsupport and financial resources. The agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations, along with regional organizations,\r\nshould continue to encourage and assist Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina to face the remaining challenges. In that\r\nrespect, the European Union police mission that will\r\ntake over in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 1 January\r\n2003 is of particular importance.\r\nOur work should more vigorously address the\r\npeople and their needs, finding areas of leverage that\r\nwill consolidate political stability, peace and security\r\nand spark an economic revival. Slovenia is interested\r\nin the peace, political stability and functioning\r\neconomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have\r\ndemonstrated that interest through economic\r\ncooperation and our ongoing support for the integration\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina into European structures.\r\nSlovenia is actively participating in the\r\nstabilization processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By\r\nestablishing the International Trust Fund for Demining\r\nand the Regional Centre for the Psychosocial Well-\r\nbeing of Children, it seeks to contribute to improving\r\nthe daily lives of ordinary people who continue to be\r\naffected by the legacy of war.\r\nSlovenia actively participates in the process of\r\nstabilization of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Through the\r\nestablishment of the International Trust Fund for\r\nDemining and the Regional Centre for the Psychosocial\r\nWell-being of Children, it wants to contribute to\r\nameliorating the daily life of ordinary people who\r\ncontinue to be affected by the legacy of war. Slovenia\r\nis actively taking part in the Stability Pact for South-\r\nEastern Europe and is a troop-contributing country to\r\nthe Stablization Force.\r\nWe continue to believe that the revival of the\r\neconomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is vital for the\r\nstabilization and prosperity of the country and of the\r\nregion. In addition to liberalizing trade and providing a\r\nfavourable investment climate, our efforts should be\r\naimed at better utilizing the skills and energy of local\r\nhuman resources and at making better use of the\r\ncountry’s natural resources. Creating jobs, generating\r\nincentives for the development of small and medium-\r\nsize enterprises, and encouraging skilled trained people\r\nto stay in their home country are some of the important\r\ntasks today facing both the international community\r\nand the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In\r\nrecent years, Slovenia has been one of the biggest\r\nforeign investors in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it\r\ncontinues to be a strong advocate of economic\r\ncooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina at all levels.\r\nWe strongly support the efforts of the High\r\nRepresentative to strengthen the rule of law and to\r\nbuild a solid judicial system. Slovenia was among the\r\nstrongest supporters of membership for Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina in the Council of Europe, which provides\r\ngood opportunities to exercise the rule of law.\r\nIntegration into European structures provides a firm\r\nguarantee of the consolidation of democracy and\r\nstabilization of the country and the entire region, in all\r\naspects.\r\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize that Slovenia\r\nshares the view that the High Representative, Paddy\r\nAshdown, expressed last month to the Security\r\nCouncil, that the outcome of the recent elections was a\r\ncall for a change. That call by the people of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina has to be transformed into their active\r\nengagement in the process of consolidating their State,\r\nbased on European standards of good governance and\r\nsound domestic economic policies that foster growth\r\nand development. The international community should\r\nspare no effort to continue to support the endeavours of\r\nthe people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in assuming\r\ntheir overall responsibility for their future. Slovenia is\r\ndetermined to continue its active participation in those\r\nefforts.\r\nMr. Haneda (Japan): Japan highly commends\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina for its achievements in\r\nimplementing the peace process over the past year,\r\nsuch as its admission to the Council of Europe, the\r\namendment of the Constitutions of the two entities to\r\nensure equality among the three main ethnic groups\r\nand the holding of self-organized elections. We also\r\nappreciate the efforts of the High Representative, Mr.\r\nPaddy Ashdown, the members of the Peace\r\nImplementation Council, and all those who have\r\nparticipated in the United Nations Mission in Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina (UNMIBH), the Stabilization Force\r\nand other relevant organizations. At the same time, we\r\nrecognize that much remains to be done pending the\r\nday when Bosnia and Herzegovina will stand on its\r\nown without the involvement of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nThe general elections last month were the first to\r\nbe conducted by the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nsince the end of the conflict in 1995, and were thus an\r\nimportant milestone in the peace implementation\r\nprocess. Recognizing the importance of the elections,\r\nthe Government of Japan dispatched observers to\r\nparticipate in the monitoring team of the Organization\r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe. We also\r\nprovided support to a United Nations Development\r\nProgramme project, whose purpose was to raise the\r\nconsciousness of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nwith regard to the importance of the elections.\r\nJapan is encouraged by the fact that the general\r\nelections were carried out smoothly, and largely in\r\naccordance with international standards. The tenure of\r\nthe elected officials is four years. That period will be\r\ncrucially important for the peace implementation\r\nprocess. Japan looks forward to the early formation of\r\na new, effectively functioning Government that will\r\nassume responsibility for the future of the country and\r\nmake every effort to pursue the peace implementation\r\nprocess in cooperation with the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIt is particularly important that the elected leaders\r\ncommit themselves, as a matter of priority, to work\r\ntogether to advance reforms necessary for the\r\nestablishment of the rule of law and the creation of\r\nemployment opportunities, as advocated by the High\r\nRepresentative. They will also be expected to address\r\nthe six elements of the reform agenda that Mr.\r\nAshdown set out last month. Corruption and organized\r\ncrime are also issues that demand their urgent\r\nattention.\r\nIt is essential that the new Government cooperate\r\nwith the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former\r\nYugoslavia. We call upon the newly elected officials\r\nand all other parties concerned to fully support the\r\nactivities of the Tribunal and to surrender all those who\r\nhave been indicted. We urge Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nto restructure its justice system as a whole and to\r\ndevelop the national capacity to prosecute less serious\r\nwar crimes.\r\nLet me briefly refer to the United Nations\r\nMission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Japan notes with\r\nsatisfaction that UNMIBH has made commendable\r\nprogress in police reform, border control and the return\r\nof members of minority groups, and that it is in the\r\nfinal stages of implementing its core mandate. That,\r\nindeed, is a good example of a successful exit strategy\r\nof a United Nations peacekeeping operation. Japan is\r\nalso pleased to note that the preparations for the\r\ntransition of responsibility from UNMIBH to the\r\nEuropean Union Police Mission are well on track.\r\nJapan has been an active member of the Steering\r\nBoard of the Peace Implementation Council. We have\r\npledged and are steadily implementing a donation of\r\napproximately $500 million to assist in the\r\nreconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina in various\r\nareas including transportation, food, medical services,\r\neducation, mine clearance and refugee returns. Japan,\r\nin cooperation with the rest of the international\r\ncommunity, will continue its steadfast support of the\r\npeace implementation process in the belief that the\r\nstability and prosperity of Bosnia and Herzegovina are\r\ncrucial to the peace and development of South-Eastern\r\nEurope as a whole.\r\nIn closing, I am pleased to voice Japan’s support\r\nfor the draft resolution before us in document\r\nA/57/L.15/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Šahović (Yugoslavia): This debate is taking\r\nplace between two important events in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. At the beginning of October, the first\r\nlocally organized general elections took place. At the\r\nend of next month, the United Nations will complete its\r\nmandate there and will be replaced by a European\r\nUnion mission. Both events testify to the overall\r\npositive developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nsince last year’s debate in the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation would like to acknowledge the\r\nsignificant contribution of the outgoing United Nations\r\nMission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) to\r\nstability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thus in the\r\nregion as a whole. We are looking forward to a smooth\r\ntransition to the European Union mission and express\r\nour confidence in its equally constructive engagement\r\nin the future.\r\nCooperation and the development of stable and\r\nfriendly relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina are\r\namong the top objectives of Yugoslavia’s foreign\r\npolicy. I am pleased to be able to state that, both\r\nbilaterally and regionally, important progress has been\r\nachieved over the past year in pursuing those goals.\r\nOur two countries maintain a regular dialogue on many\r\nissues of mutual interest and the tangible results are in\r\nevidence.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nThe Inter-State Council for Cooperation met\r\nearlier this year in Belgrade at the highest political\r\nlevel. A number of ministerial and other high-level\r\nofficial visits were also exchanged. I would like to\r\nunderline in particular the importance of the trilateral\r\nmeeting in July of the heads of State of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Croatia and Yugoslavia in Sarajevo. We\r\nexpect another similar summit in the future.\r\nAllow me to mention also just a few concrete\r\nexamples of an upward trend characterizing our\r\ncooperation. The negotiations on border identification\r\nbetween the two countries are progressing and over 50\r\nper cent of the borderline has been identified. In\r\naddition to the Free Trade Agreement, our two\r\ncountries have recently signed an agreement on dual\r\ncitizenship that will significantly facilitate the exercise\r\nof rights of citizens on both sides of the border. These\r\nagreements, together with the existing non-visa regime,\r\nare aimed at ensuring a free flow of people and goods\r\nacross our border. Agreements on road transportation\r\nand social insurance have also been signed, while\r\nseveral other bilateral agreements are currently in\r\npreparation.\r\nThis active cooperation is conducted on the basis\r\nof full respect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and within the\r\nframework of the Dayton/Paris Agreement. Yugoslavia\r\nremains fully committed to the implementation of the\r\nAgreement and to the fulfilment of its obligation in that\r\nregard.\r\nBoth our countries are also engaged in intensive\r\nefforts to achieve stability and cooperation within\r\nregional organizations, particularly within the Stability\r\nPact for South-Eastern Europe and the South-East\r\nEuropean Cooperation Process, which Yugoslavia is\r\ncurrently chairing. These forums are particularly\r\nimportant in giving a direction to the implementation\r\nof regionally shared objectives, such as the\r\nenhancement of democracy and the rule of law, the\r\ndevelopment of the market economy, respect for human\r\nrights, and combating terrorism and organized crime.\r\nAlthough, as I have mentioned, a lot has been\r\nachieved in normalizing and improving the relations\r\nbetween Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nmuch remains to be done to overcome the difficult\r\nlegacy of the 1990s. To that end, we are looking\r\nforward to cooperating with the new Government of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. One issue requires particular\r\nattention. While some 60,000 returns to and within\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina have been registered in 2002,\r\nthere are still some 400,000 refugees remaining in my\r\ncountry. Obviously, further joint efforts, both bilateral\r\nand regional, are necessary to speed up the return\r\nprocess.\r\nFinally, I would like to commend the continuing\r\nefforts of High Representative Lord Ashdown in\r\naccelerating the process of reform and institution-\r\nbuilding in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We share the view\r\nthat this is the best way to enable the citizens of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina to take responsibility for their country\r\ninto their own hands, through their elected\r\nrepresentatives. My country stands ready to cooperate\r\nfully within the regional framework and as a regional\r\npartner in pursuing this goal.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.15/Rev.1. I must advise the General\r\nAssembly that, in addition to the countries listed on the\r\ndraft resolution, the United States of America has\r\nbecome a sponsor.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.15/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/57/L.15/Rev.1 was adopted\r\n(resolution 57/10).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 34?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 38\r\nThe situation in Central America: procedures for the\r\nestablishment of a firm and lasting peace and\r\nprogress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/57/384,\r\nA/57/584)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/57/336)\r\nMr. Brattskar (Norway): Since the conclusion of\r\nthe peace agreements in Guatemala, Norway has\r\nactively supported the implementation process. We will\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\ncontinue to do so next year as well. Since the last\r\nRegional Consultative Group meeting in Washington in\r\nFebruary, some important advances have taken place,\r\nbut we do not feel that there has been a true\r\nacceleration in the implementation of the peace\r\naccords.\r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his report,\r\nin some areas backsliding is apparent and the greater\r\nrespect for human rights that was apparent after the\r\n1996 ceasefire has eroded over the last year. Violations\r\nagainst and harassment of human right defenders\r\ncontinue and, as the report points out, violations by the\r\npolice have increased. Ghosts from the past, in the\r\nshape of illegal groups and clandestine structures,\r\napparently still exist. This gives cause for concern, and\r\nit is clear that more decisive action by the Government\r\nis needed. We also share the concern expressed by the\r\nSecretary-General that stagnation in the\r\nimplementation of the peace accords, coupled with\r\ndeterioration in other areas, could jeopardize progress\r\nmade since 1996. We strongly hope that the\r\nGovernment, in cooperation with civil society, will do\r\nits utmost to continue implementing the accords, as\r\nwell as the nine points that came out of the Washington\r\nmeeting in February. We look forward to the next\r\nmeeting of the Consultative Group, which we hope will\r\ntake place in Guatemala in March 2003.\r\nPart of our support for the peace process has been\r\nthrough contributions to maintain the presence of the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA). We support the prolongation of\r\nMINUGUA through 2003. Unfortunately, the planned\r\nending of MINUGUA would coincide with the\r\nGuatemalan change of Government following elections\r\nin the autumn of 2003. It is doubtful whether adequate\r\nmechanisms to replace the functions of MINUGUA\r\nwill have been put in place before that time. My\r\nGovernment considers it important that the\r\nimplementation process not be left to itself in this\r\ncrucial period. Norway therefore supports the extension\r\nof the mandate of MINUGUA, in the form of a\r\nrestricted presence, for one more year until the end of\r\n2004. The focus of this restricted presence should be\r\non human rights, indigenous rights and the role of the\r\narmy in a democratic society. It is, however, of the\r\nhighest importance that the Guatemalan authorities as\r\nsoon as possible establish mechanisms that can take\r\nover MINUGUA’s mission.\r\nMany of the countries in Central America have\r\nlong been riddled with corruption, something that can\r\ncripple any attempt at development. It is therefore with\r\ngreat interest that we observe the struggle against\r\ncorruption that is taking place in these countries,\r\nparticularly Nicaragua.\r\nFinally, we congratulate the facilitators of the\r\nprocess concerning the border dispute between\r\nGuatemala and Belize. We hope the proposals put\r\nforward by them will lead to a final and permanent\r\nsettlement of the issue.\r\nMr. Moesby (Denmark): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The countries\r\nof Central and Eastern Europe associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the country of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area that is a member of the\r\nEuropean Free Trade Association — Iceland — align\r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nLet me first express the gratitude of the European\r\nUnion to the Secretary-General for the excellent and\r\ninsightful report on the situation in Central America,\r\nwhich provides a solid foundation for today’s\r\ndiscussion on this agenda item.\r\nThe European Union and Central America form a\r\nstrong partnership based on fundamental principles and\r\nshared hopes for a better future. The European Union\r\nwishes to continue to develop this partnership in order\r\nto establish progress and lasting peace in the region\r\nfounded on democratic principles of peace, freedom\r\nand development.\r\nMuch has changed in Central America in the\r\nalmost 20 years since we first discussed this agenda\r\nitem. Democracy has prevailed. Conflicts have been\r\nbrought to an end. Progress and development have\r\nbeen allowed to settle and prosper in the region.\r\nHowever, despite the important steps taken, the risk of\r\nserious setbacks in the democratic process continues.\r\nWe still see the long shadows of the internal conflicts,\r\nthe difficulties of transition to systems of democratic\r\npluralism and the challenges of equitable and\r\nsustainable development. These obstacles remain in the\r\nway of lasting peace, freedom and economic prosperity\r\nin the region.\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nCentral America must face the difficult problems\r\nin the region in order to consolidate the substantial\r\nprogress made so far. Reforms, and the courage to\r\nimplement them, are necessary in fighting social\r\ninequalities, unemployment and poverty. Otherwise\r\nthese will feed political tension and conflict.\r\nThe European Union has always been committed\r\nto the development of Central America. Through our\r\nFramework Co-operation Agreement and Community\r\nAction Plan for the Reconstruction of Central America\r\nthis commitment has materialized into concrete actions\r\nand activities. Our efforts focus on regional integration\r\nand in sectors such as health, education and\r\nenvironmental protection.\r\nSince 1984, political cooperation between the\r\nEuropean Union and Central America has been\r\ninstitutionalized in the San José Dialogue. Ministers of\r\nour two regions met at the XVIII Ministerial\r\nConference of the San José Dialogue, held in Madrid in\r\nMay this year. At the Conference, the ministers\r\nconfirmed their commitment to the consolidation of\r\ndemocratic systems, the establishment of closer\r\neconomic and trade relations and the promotion of\r\nhuman development. They also reaffirmed their\r\ncommitment to peaceful settlement of disputes in\r\naccordance with international law.\r\nBased on these commitments we agreed to bring\r\nour biregional dialogue towards a newer stage of more\r\ndynamic and substantial relations. This was a decision\r\nthat we believe will be beneficial to both the European\r\nUnion and Central America.\r\nThe European Union this year has observed, with\r\nthe greatest concern, a deterioration of the human\r\nrights situation in Guatemala. Particularly worrying is\r\nthe serious increase in the threats and assaults directed\r\nagainst human rights defenders. We condemn these acts\r\nin the strongest possible terms. The Guatemalan\r\nauthorities have a clear obligation to protect those who\r\nare targeted and to bring those responsible to justice.\r\nThe widespread impunity in Guatemala must come to\r\nan end.\r\nThe United Nations Verification Mission in\r\nGuatemala (MINUGUA) has performed remarkably\r\nwell in consolidating the achievements of the peace\r\nagreement. The European Union takes note of the\r\nSecretary General’s intention to initiate consultations\r\nwith interested Member States regarding the request of\r\nthe Guatemalan Government for an extension of\r\nMINUGUA’s mandate into 2004. The European Union\r\nunderlines the importance of MINUGUA completing\r\nits tasks in the human rights field before gradually\r\nhanding over its mandate to independent national\r\nauthorities of Guatemala, bearing in mind the political\r\ncalendar of Guatemala in 2003. We believe that the\r\nombudsman institution could have an important role to\r\nplay when MINUGUA’s tasks are handed over. We\r\nintend to provide the necessary support to that end.\r\nThe Government and the parliament of\r\nGuatemala must fulfil their responsibilities, in\r\naccordance with the peace process, if the democratic\r\nprocess is to succeed. This includes full\r\nimplementation of the Fiscal Pact, ensuring\r\ntransparency in public spending and intensifying the\r\nfight against corruption. Guatemala must initiate land\r\nreforms, ensure respect of the rights of the indigenous\r\npopulation and establish civilian control over State\r\nintelligence agencies. These steps are crucial for\r\nrevitalising the peace process. Just like Guatemalan\r\npeople, the European Union hopes for a peaceful and\r\nprosperous future for Guatemala.\r\nWe believe that political and economic\r\nintegration is of key importance to the future\r\ndevelopment of Central America. Successful regional\r\nintegration will lead to a successful integration into the\r\nworld economy as a whole. The European Union\r\ntherefore wholeheartedly supports the important work\r\nby the Central American Integration System. Drug\r\ntrafficking, increasing crime rates and labour migration\r\nwithin the region are examples of regional challenges\r\nthat the Central American countries have to face in\r\nunison in order to overcome them.\r\nIn the context of political integration, the\r\nEuropean Union is delighted to note the progress made\r\nto find a just, equitable and definitive solution to the\r\nborder dispute between Belize and Guatemala. We\r\nhope that the settlement of the dispute will open a new\r\nera of understanding, cooperation and friendship\r\nbetween the two countries and become a source of\r\ninspiration for other countries in the region. The\r\nEuropean Union recognizes the importance played by\r\nthe Organization of American States (OAS) in\r\nfacilitating the agreement between Belize and\r\nGuatemala, and we reiterate our support for OAS\r\ninitiatives to settle the remaining disputes in the region.\r\nThese initiatives deserve our full encouragement.\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.47\r\nNicaragua is changing, and important steps have\r\nbeen taken to ensure its citizens a better and safer\r\nfuture. We fully support the efforts of President\r\nBolaños to raise ethical standards in public life, to fight\r\nthe scourge of corruption and to modernize and\r\nrationalize the Nicaraguan economy.\r\nThe reforms advocated by the Government are\r\nessential in order to strengthen the rule of law and\r\ndemocratic institutions. The European Union\r\naccordingly urges other State institutions in Nicaragua\r\nto collaborate with President Bolaños in his efforts to\r\nmeet the challenges ahead.\r\nThis year we have joined the people of El\r\nSalvador in their celebration of the tenth anniversary of\r\nthe peace agreements. The European Union wishes to\r\ncongratulate El Salvador on this important anniversary\r\nthat put an end to the 12 tragic years of conflict in that\r\ncountry. The agreement set a guiding example of how\r\nto reach peaceful political solutions for the benefit of\r\nthe people and for peace and stability of Central\r\nAmerica.\r\nThe European Union also wishes to commend El\r\nSalvador for the appointment of a new Ombudsman —\r\nor in point of fact an Ombudswoman — to the office of\r\nthe national Ombudsman. The Ombudsman institution\r\nhas a key role to play in protecting the rights of\r\nvulnerable and marginalized sectors of the population,\r\nsuch as poor and indigenous people. The European\r\nUnion therefore applauds the work of the Ombudsman\r\ninstitutions in Central America; they are indispensable\r\nwatchdogs of democracy.\r\nThe European Union welcomes and supports the\r\nefforts of the new Government of Honduras under\r\nPresident Maduro to address the problems related to\r\npoverty, corruption and social disintegration, which\r\nchallenge the maturing democracy of that country.\r\nHowever, the European Union is concerned about the\r\nongoing violence, as well as the recent worrying\r\nincrease in human rights violations. The European\r\nUnion underscores the need for stronger Government\r\nmeasures to protect and safeguard the rule of law, in\r\naccordance with international human rights and\r\nhumanitarian law. Also, the high number of killings of\r\nchildren and youth is a source of great concern for the\r\nUnion. It therefore calls for further efforts of the\r\nGovernment of Honduras, under President Maduro, to\r\naddress the disturbing situation.\r\nThe European Union is paying close attention to\r\nthe situation in Central America. Our partnership is one\r\nof mutual respect, and we wish to strengthen our future\r\npolitical and economic cooperation. Strengthening\r\ndemocracy, fighting social inequalities, promoting\r\nefficient government and protecting human rights go\r\nhand in hand with peace, sustainable development and\r\nthe creation of favourable conditions for markets and\r\ntrade. These are ambitions that we share with the\r\npeople of Central America.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: On Thursday morning, 14\r\nNovember, the General Assembly will hear the\r\nremaining speakers on agenda item 38, “The situation\r\nin Central America: procedures for the establishment of\r\na firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a\r\nregion of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment”, and will also consider agenda item 167,\r\n“South American Zone of Peace and Cooperation”.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
