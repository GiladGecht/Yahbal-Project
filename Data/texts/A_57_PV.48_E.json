(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 26\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of\r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/264 and\r\nAdd.1)\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.5)\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMexico bases its foreign relations on the principles of\r\ninternational law that regulate coexistence among\r\nnations and that are also established in my country’s\r\nConstitution. These include the self-determination of\r\npeoples, non-intervention, the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes, the prohibition of the threat or use of force,\r\nthe legal equality of States, international cooperation\r\nfor development and the struggle for international\r\npeace and security.\r\nMexico respects the inalienable right of all States\r\nto choose their own economic, political and social\r\nsystems, in accordance with the will of their peoples,\r\nand considers that unilateral actions which contradict\r\nthe norms of the international legal order and the\r\naspirations of our peoples undermine the foundations\r\nof the United Nations. That is why my Government has\r\nrepeatedly expressed its rejection of the imposition of\r\npolitical, economic or military sanctions that have not\r\nbeen expressly approved by the Security Council or by\r\nthe General Assembly. In particular, Mexico has\r\nrejected the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo unilaterally imposed against Cuba and, since\r\n1992, has consistently supported all resolutions\r\nadopted by the General Assembly related to the need to\r\nend that embargo. This clear stand taken by Mexico\r\nand the international community, which reflects the\r\nprinciples of reason and law, must not be ignored any\r\nlonger. This is required by the spirit of harmony that\r\nmust prevail among all States on the basis of full\r\nrespect for our Organization’s Charter.\r\nAs we informed the Secretary-General, when the\r\nso called Helms-Burton law was proclaimed, the\r\nGovernment of Mexico declared that law to be contrary\r\nto the principles of international law, a position fully in\r\nkeeping with the ruling of the Inter-American Juridical\r\nCommittee of 4 June 1996.\r\nFor this same purpose and in order to eliminate\r\nthe negative impact of extraterritorial measures that\r\naffect Mexico’s free trade with other countries,\r\nMexico’s Act on Protection of Trade and Investment\r\nagainst Foreign Norms which Violate International\r\nLaw entered into force on 24 October 1996. This act\r\nprohibits national courts from recognizing or executing\r\nforeign judicial decisions and orders against Mexican\r\ncompanies, based on foreign laws with extraterritorial\r\neffects that are contrary to international law. It also\r\nforbids companies established in Mexico from carrying\r\nout any acts or failing to act in such a manner as to\r\nprejudice trade or investment in Mexico as a result of\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nsuch laws. Similarly, this law establishes a right to\r\nappeal before federal courts on behalf of individual or\r\nlegal entities situated in Mexico to sue for payment for\r\ndamages or loss as a result of legal or administrative\r\nproceedings before foreign authorities’ courts in the\r\napplication of such laws.\r\nIt is also prohibited, under the Act, to provide\r\ninformation required by foreign courts or authorities on\r\nthe basis of such laws, to be used against the interests\r\nof the company, and imposes financial penalities for\r\nnon-compliance.\r\nActing along the same lines, in August 1999\r\nMexico supported the Cuban Republic’s adherence to\r\nthe Latin American Integration Association, and in\r\nMay 2001, it signed an agreement for the reciprocal\r\npromotion and protection of investments. Most\r\nrecently, in May 2002, Mexico and Cuba signed the\r\nSecond Additional Protocol to the Economic\r\nComplementation Agreement Number 51, setting out\r\nprinciples concerning rules of origin.\r\nMexico’s relations with the Republic of Cuba are\r\nbased on friendship and mutual respect between our\r\npeoples, in addition to unswerving resolve to promote\r\nnon-discriminatory trade policies in addition to a\r\nstrong economic link.\r\nThe embargo on Cuba must end. Its negative\r\nimpact on the Cuban people, most particularly on the\r\nmost vulnerable groups in society, are a cause of grave\r\nconcern for my country and for the international\r\ncommunity which is represented in this General\r\nAssembly. And this is demonstrated by the\r\noverwhelming majority that votes in favour of the\r\nresolution. Mexico, as it has done throughout the past\r\ndecade, will once again vote in favour of the new draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/57/L.5.\r\nMr. Huang Zhongpo (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nOver the past 10 years, the United Nations General\r\nAssembly has adopted a resolution every year calling\r\non all States, in conformity with their obligations under\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the norms of\r\ninternational law, to repeal or invalidate laws and\r\nmeasures with extraterritorial effects which affect the\r\nsovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of\r\nentities or persons under their jurisdiction and the\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation.\r\nDespite such just demands by the international\r\ncommunity, unfortunately, the country concerned has\r\nyet to honour this series of General Assembly\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe United States embargo and other sanctions\r\nagainst Cuba have been in place for more than four\r\ndecades, with the purported goal of promoting\r\ndemocracy and human rights. As it turns out, the\r\nembargo and other sanctions have severely impeded\r\nCuban efforts to alleviate poverty, to raise the standard\r\nof living, and to realize economic and social\r\ndevelopment for national construction. The United\r\nStates action constitutes an encroachment on the\r\nhuman rights and the fundamental freedoms of the\r\nCuban people, including their right to subsistence and\r\ndevelopment. Using an embargo and other sanctions to\r\nforce a country to abandon its chosen path of\r\ndevelopment, or even to subvert its Government, is\r\ncontrary to the purposes and principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, as well as fundamental\r\nnorms in modern international relations. It is a\r\ndistortion and flagrant violation of the principle of\r\ndemocracy.\r\nEconomic sanctions imposed by the United States\r\non Cuba have an extraterritorial character that flies in\r\nthe face of international law and the principles,\r\nobjectives and rules of international trade. They also\r\ncontradict the principle of trade liberalization\r\nadvocated by the United States itself.\r\nToday, as many as 78 countries are known to have\r\nsuffered economic losses as a result of United Nations\r\nsanctions against Cuba. This is good reason for the\r\ninternational community to raise serious concerns on\r\nsuch an embargo and sanctions, justifying the call for\r\ntheir immediate cessation.\r\nIt is the persistent position of the Chinese\r\nGovernment that purposes and principles of the Charter\r\nof the United Nations should serve as the basis for the\r\npromotion of democratization, international relations\r\nand the realization of overall development and\r\ncommon prosperity in all countries. Sovereignty,\r\nequality, and non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nother countries remain at the core of the norms\r\ngoverning international relations. The sovereign right\r\nof each country to chose its own political and social\r\nsystems and its development model, as well as to\r\nmanage its own affairs, should be subject to no\r\ntransgression.\r\nDisputes among States should be resolved\r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation, on the basis of the\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nprinciples of equality and mutual respect. The Chinese\r\nGovernment objects to the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against\r\nCuba.\r\nWe support the efforts of the Cuban Government\r\nand the Cuban people to safeguard their national\r\nindependence and their State sovereignty. It is our hope\r\nthat the United States Government will act in\r\naccordance with the prevailing trend and substitute\r\ndialogue for confrontation; resort to contacts and\r\nexchanges instead of the embargo and other sanctions;\r\nand take concrete measures to implement the relevant\r\nresolutions of the General Assembly.\r\nChina supports the draft resolution sponsored by\r\nCuba under the agenda item currently under\r\nconsideration.\r\nMr. Nguyen Thanh Chau (Viet Nam): The\r\nfollowing excerpt is from Tolstoy’s collection of fables.\r\nThe sheep asked the lion: “Why do you have to\r\nkill me?”. The lion answered: “Because five years ago,\r\nyou tampered with my waterhole”. “But I was not even\r\nborn at the time”. “It must have been your father,\r\nthen”. “But he wasn’t born, either”. “That’s enough! I\r\nam hungry”. And the lion ate the sheep. This is the\r\ntypical law of the jungle. We human beings must act\r\naccording to common sense.\r\nFor more than 40 years now, the small island of\r\nCuba and its people have been subjected to an\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo because\r\nof their “sin”: having dared to take their destiny into\r\ntheir own hands and advancing along the course of\r\ndevelopment they themselves have chosen. The Cubans\r\ndo not obey the teaching of turning the other cheek\r\nwhen slapped, but heroically stand up as one in defence\r\nof their country.\r\nTheir punishment is unilaterally imposed, but its\r\nimpact is of multilateral scope. It is not only the Cuban\r\npeople, and, in particular, the children, who are on the\r\nreceiving end. Interregional and international relations\r\nalso suffer, as many countries are not allowed to do\r\nbusiness with Cuba, or must do so while looking over\r\ntheir shoulder the whole time. No one benefits from\r\nthis ridiculous situation, and it is therefore high time\r\nthat this embargo be lifted.\r\nThe item entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba” has\r\nbeen on the agenda of the General Assembly for 10\r\nconsecutive years, since 1992. The overwhelming\r\nmajority of the Member States and agencies of the\r\nUnited Nations continue to voice their opposition to\r\nthis unilateral embargo, and numerous United Nations\r\nresolutions have been adopted that condemn the policy\r\nof applying extraterritorial laws and coercive measures\r\nagainst Cuba, a sovereign State, as reflected in the\r\nSecretary- General’s report (A/57/264 and Add.1). It is\r\nobvious that these policies violate the most\r\nfundamental principles and purposes enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. Moreover, they\r\ncontravene international law and the most basic norms\r\nof international relations — namely development\r\ncooperation based on equality among sovereign States\r\nand non-discrimination with respect to political\r\nsystems.\r\nThe Government and the people of Viet Nam\r\nfully support the Government and the people of Cuba\r\nin the process of national reconstruction and defence.\r\nThis support stems not only from the cordial relations\r\nthat exist between the two countries, but also from\r\nhuman common sense. We vigorously and consistently\r\noppose the unilateral economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo that has been imposed against Cuba\r\nover the last four decades and demand an immediate\r\nend to the blockade. There is no justification for the\r\ncontinuation of these hostile policies for even one more\r\nday.\r\nWe believe that any differences between the\r\nUnited States and the Republic of Cuba should be\r\nresolved through dialogue and peaceful negotiations,\r\non the basis of mutual respect for independence and\r\nsovereignty and in accordance with the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and of\r\ninternational law. We welcome any efforts, even\r\nembryonic, on both sides that could help to break the\r\ndeadlock; they are long overdue.\r\nViet Nam will, as always, join the majority in\r\nvoting once again in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.5, and we will continue to do so until an end\r\nhas been put to the inhumane embargo and blockade\r\nimposed against Cuba.\r\nMr. Siv (United States of America): The United\r\nStates embargo against Cuba is strictly a matter of\r\nbilateral policy. It is not a subject that the General\r\nAssembly should spend valuable time considering. We\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nstrongly oppose this misguided draft resolution, and we\r\nencourage all delegations to do the same.\r\nThe allegation that the United States prohibits\r\nother nations from trading with Cuba does not reflect\r\nreality. Trade figures show that Cuba imports some\r\n$1 billion worth of goods every year from many\r\ndifferent countries, including member States of the\r\nEuropean Union. Related assertions that the embargo is\r\nthe cause of Cuba’s economic problems are equally\r\nuntrue.\r\nThe objective of United States policy towards\r\nCuba is clear: to foster a rapid, peaceful transition to a\r\ndemocratic form of Government where human rights\r\nare protected, civil society thrives, and economic\r\nprosperity is extended to all Cubans. Our bilateral\r\neconomic embargo is but one element of a multifaceted\r\npolicy designed to accomplish this objective.\r\nWhile maintaining significant restrictions on\r\ntrade with Cuba, the United States has moved to\r\ndramatically expand its support for the Cuban people.\r\nCuba benefits greatly from the generosity of American\r\ncitizens. In the past two years, direct cash remittances\r\nfrom Americans to Cubans are estimated to have\r\ntotalled at least $1.2 billion. In 2001 alone, the United\r\nStates Government approved licences that permit\r\nhumanitarian donations to Cuba worth up to $362\r\nmillion. In the wake of Hurricane Michelle, the United\r\nStates offered assistance that the Cuban Government\r\ndeclined. Cuba did, however, reverse its previous\r\npolicy of refusing to buy American food. According to\r\npublished reports, as of August this year the Cuban\r\nGovernment has purchased $96 million worth of\r\nAmerican agricultural commodities. It is currently\r\nnegotiating to purchase much more. These sales benefit\r\nboth American farmers and the Cuban people.\r\nChanges in Cuba would allow us to reconsider\r\nour trade restrictions. As President Bush said in his\r\nspeech of 20 May, describing his initiative for a new\r\nCuba,\r\n“If the Cuban Government takes concrete steps\r\ntowards democracy and market reforms, I will\r\nwork with our Congress to ease the United States\r\ntrade and travel restrictions”.\r\nUnfortunately, the Cuban Government shows no\r\nsigns of abandoning its policies — policies that deny\r\nthe Cuban people their fundamental rights. The fact is\r\nthat the Cuban Government consistently flouts the\r\nresolutions of the United Nations Commission on\r\nHuman Rights. Its human rights violations include the\r\ncontinued harassment of independent voices, such as\r\nthat of Pedro Castellanos, who was detained for merely\r\ndistributing copies of the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights. Another recent example is the\r\ncontinued imprisonment of people such as Leonardo\r\nBruzón, who was locked up simply for expressing his\r\nopposition to the regime. Bruzón, an Amnesty\r\nInternational prisoner of conscience, is now in a\r\nhospital prison, suffering from the consequences of a\r\nhunger strike he undertook to protest his imprisonment.\r\nWe were particularly disappointed this year by\r\nthe Cuban Government’s decision — apparently\r\ndisregarding its own constitution — to ignore the\r\nVarela Project, in which 11,000 Cuban citizens\r\npetitioned for a referendum that would bring about the\r\nrelease of political prisoners, free elections and\r\neconomic reform. The failure of the Cuban\r\nGovernment to respect the rights of its people concerns\r\nmore than just Cuba. The focus of the international\r\ncommunity, as manifested in the United Nations,\r\nshould be on the continuing human rights crisis in\r\nCuba, rather than on bilateral United States efforts to\r\nencourage a peaceful transition to democracy.\r\nFor all those reasons, the United States strongly\r\nopposes this misguided draft resolution, and we\r\nencourage all delegations to do the same.\r\nMs. Ndhlovu (South Africa): My delegation\r\nwelcomes the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque, to this debate on\r\nagenda item 26, “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. We thank him\r\nin advance for his statement, to be delivered later, and\r\nfor his leadership on this issue.\r\nMy delegation considers it sad that we again have\r\nto address the item on the necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. We are\r\nnevertheless here to reaffirm our determination to work\r\ntowards a better world for all, where nations can\r\npeacefully co-exist and international laws that guide all\r\ncivilized States are observed.\r\nWe firmly believe in adherence to the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter, which\r\nought to be binding on all Members of our\r\nOrganization. The selective application of Charter\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nprovisions should be rejected with the contempt that it\r\ndeserves.\r\nThe international community has repeatedly and\r\nconsistently called for the lifting of this embargo, and\r\nwe agree that that is the right thing to do. For more\r\nthan 40 years, the people of Cuba have suffered from\r\nthis relentless and unilateral embargo. The tragedy of\r\nthe unilateral embargo is that it continues to cause\r\nuntold suffering to the people of Cuba. The daily lives\r\nof men, women and children in Cuba have been\r\nseriously affected by policies beyond their control. It is\r\ntherefore no wonder that the overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States are here to rally in support of the draft\r\nresolution before us.\r\nAt the Thirteenth Interministerial Conference of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, held in Cartagena in\r\n2000, an appeal was made to the Government of the\r\nUnited States of America\r\n“to put an end to the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba which, in\r\naddition to being unilateral and contrary to the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and international law, and\r\nto the principle of neighbourliness, cause huge\r\nmaterial losses and economic damage to the\r\npeople of Cuba.”\r\nThe Ministers further expressed their\r\n“deep concern over the widening of the\r\nextraterritorial nature of the embargo against\r\nCuba and over continuous new legislative\r\nmeasures geared to intensifying it.”\r\nThose views were repeated at the Ministerial\r\nMeeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement in Durban.\r\nThe Ministers also condemned the continued\r\napplication by certain countries of extraterritorial\r\nmeasures and legislation, and their imposition of\r\nunilateral coercive economic measures against certain\r\ndeveloping countries aimed at preventing those\r\ncountries from exercising their right to determine, with\r\ntotal free will, their own political, economic and social\r\nsystems. They further called on all States not to\r\nrecognize unilateral extraterritorial laws, since such\r\nmeasures and legislation threaten the sovereignty of\r\nStates, adversely affect their social and economic\r\ndevelopment and are contrary to international law, the\r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter, the norms and\r\nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States\r\nand the agreed principles of the multilateral trading\r\nsystem.\r\nMy delegation fully associates itself with those\r\nviews and calls upon all countries to reject the\r\nunilateral extraterritorial measures imposed against\r\nCuba because they stand in stark contrast to\r\ninternational laws that guide all civilized States. My\r\ndelegation firmly believes in the need for a rules-based\r\ninternational system in which small and big nations are\r\ntreated as equal sovereign States. The United Nations\r\nCharter is an embodiment of the vision, mission,\r\nprinciples and obligations that all signatories to the\r\nCharter have to abide by. They specifically include the\r\nequality of all Member States and non-intervention and\r\nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of other\r\ncountries. Freedom to trade internationally is an\r\nintegral part of many international legal instruments.\r\nSouth Africa views the continued imposition of\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba as a flagrant violation of\r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States and\r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in the domestic\r\naffairs of Cuba. We are guided by these basic norms of\r\ninternational conduct in our principled support for the\r\nneed to eliminate coercive economic measures as a\r\nmeans of political and economic compulsion.\r\nIn line with previous United Nations resolutions\r\non this item, among others, South Africa believes that\r\nconstructive dialogue can foster mutual trust and\r\nunderstanding, as well as engender harmony and\r\npeaceful coexistence between the two nations. South\r\nAfrica will once again support the draft resolution to be\r\nconsidered by the General Assembly under this item.\r\nThis, we believe, is the least that we can do for the\r\npeople of Cuba.\r\nMs. Pulido Santana (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): Since 1991, the General Assembly has\r\nreiterated its call upon all States to refrain from\r\npromulgating and applying laws and economic,\r\ncommercial and financial measures having\r\nextraterritorial effect. It has also urged those States that\r\nhave promulgated such laws to repeal or invalidate\r\nthem as soon as possible, in keeping with their\r\ndomestic legal code.\r\nThe overwhelming majority of States Members of\r\nthe United Nations have reaffirmed year after year that\r\nsuch measures contravene the purposes and principles\r\nof the Charter, inter alia, the sovereign equality of\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nStates, non-intervention and non-interference in the\r\ndomestic affairs of other States, and the freedom of\r\ninternational trade and navigation.\r\nThe rejection and condemnation of the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba have\r\nalso been reaffirmed in innumerable statements made\r\nand resolutions adopted in other intergovernmental\r\nforums. International public opinion and the\r\ninternational community have categorically spoken out\r\nagainst the promulgation and application of such\r\nmeasures.\r\nHowever, we note with regret that the voices of\r\nthe United Nations and the international community\r\nhave not been heard or have been only partially\r\nheeded. Some continue to apply new measures or to\r\nstrengthen those already adopted in order to perpetuate\r\nand expand the embargo against Cuba, in contravention\r\nof principles of international law and the norms of\r\npeaceful relations among nations.\r\nThe Government of Venezuela, along with almost\r\nevery other Member represented here, rejects the\r\npromulgation and application of unilateral\r\nextraterritorial coercive measures, such as the\r\nnotorious Helms-Burton Act of 12 March 1996. The\r\nVenezuelan Government has voted in favour of all\r\nresolutions adopted by the General Assembly and other\r\ninternational organs and bodies that have condemned\r\nthe embargo against Cuba and called upon the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America to repeal\r\nit.\r\nSimilarly, our Government has complied with the\r\nprovisions of paragraph 4 of resolution 56/9 of\r\n27 November 2001 by providing information to the\r\nSecretary-General for inclusion in the report on\r\ncompliance with that resolution. In our reply, we have\r\npointed out, as noted in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nthat\r\n“unilateral measures such as the embargo\r\nimposed on Cuba, which is of a coercive and\r\nextraterritorial nature, have an adverse impact on\r\nthe legal framework defining economic and\r\ncommercial exchanges between nations and\r\nundermine the efforts that have been made to\r\nachieve continental and subregional economic\r\nintegration”. (A/57/264, p. 38)\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed against the Republic of Cuba is, without a\r\nshadow of a doubt, contrary to international law, the\r\nprinciple of self-determination and the legitimate\r\naspirations of the Cuban people to achieve full human\r\ndevelopment and well-being.\r\nThe Government of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela supports the General Assembly’s debate on\r\nthis item, given the negative impact of such measures\r\non the international political, economic and legal order.\r\nFor these reasons, we reaffirm the declarations adopted\r\nin this respect by the Organization of American States,\r\nthe Rio Group, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group\r\nof 15 and the Group of 77, as well as the Lima\r\nDeclaration adopted at the Eleventh Ibero-American\r\nSummit of Heads of State and Government in 2001.\r\nRecently, in the Madrid Commitment of 17 May 2002,\r\nthe heads of State and Government of the European\r\nUnion and of Latin America and the Caribbean firmly\r\nrejected all measures of a unilateral character and with\r\nextraterritorial effect, which are contrary to\r\ninternational law and the commonly accepted rules of\r\nfree trade. They agreed that this type of practice poses\r\na serious threat to multilateralism.\r\nThe Government and people of Venezuela hope\r\nthat the blockade against Cuba will cease. It is the\r\nCuban people that must suffer the consequences of the\r\napplication of such measures, which are certainly\r\nbeyond the pale of international legality and inhuman\r\nin nature.\r\nThe delegation of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela, in keeping with its stated values and in\r\nvirtue of the fact that the extraterritorial economic,\r\ncommercial and financial measures against Cuba have\r\nnot been repealed, shall vote in favour of the draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly today.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic) (spoke in French): During the four long and\r\ndifficult decades since the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial blockade has been imposed against the\r\nRepublic of Cuba by the Government of the United\r\nStates of America, the innocent people of Cuba have\r\nexperienced great suffering. The blockade has also\r\ncreated and nurtured needless tensions between the two\r\nneighbouring peoples.\r\nIn today’s world, where many forms of\r\ncooperation exist among States, it is disappointing to\r\nsee the continued existence of discriminatory unilateral\r\ntrade practices. We believe that the extraterritorial\r\napplication of the national laws of one country clearly\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nruns counter to the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. In accordance with the\r\nrelevant resolutions of the General Assembly, a\r\nMember State cannot promulgate or apply laws, rules\r\nor measures that have extraterritorial effects or that\r\ninfringe upon free trade or the sovereignty of other\r\nMember States.\r\nEvery country has the sovereign right to\r\nparticipate freely in the international financial and\r\ntrade system. Under the universal principle of State\r\nsovereignty, no country has the right to interfere in the\r\ninternal affairs of another, regardless of differences in\r\ntheir social and political systems. As a sovereign and\r\nindependent country, the Republic of Cuba has the\r\nright to choose its own political system and its own\r\ndevelopment model. In order to reduce poverty and\r\nachieve sustainable development, Cuba should have an\r\nopportunity to maintain and promote trade relations\r\nwith every nation of the world.\r\nAlong with most other Member States of the\r\nOrganization, the Lao Democratic People’s Republic\r\nwill continue to work to end the economic, financial\r\nand trade embargo against Cuba. That exceedingly\r\nobsolete policy, which runs counter to international\r\nlaw, has not benefited either party. The Republic of\r\nCuba is a Member of the United Nations. We, as\r\nMembers, must also do our utmost to help Cuba regain\r\nits legitimate right to become integrated into the\r\nglobalized world economy.\r\nIn the light of this position, my Government will\r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/57/L.5.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I should like to propose that the list of\r\nspeakers in the debate on this item be closed now.\r\nUnless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to that proposal.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I call on Mr. Ricardo Alarcón de\r\nQuesada, President of the National Assembly of\r\nPeople’s Power of Cuba, to introduce draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.5.\r\nMr. Alarcón de Quesada (Cuba) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): In 1992, the General Assembly adopted its\r\nfirst resolution calling for an end to the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba. Since then, the Assembly\r\nhas reiterated that position every year with increasingly\r\nbroad support, which now includes almost every\r\nMember State. The contrast is obvious. On one side is\r\nthe virtually unanimous opinion of the international\r\ncommunity opposing an illegitimate policy. That policy\r\nruns counter to the purposes and principles of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, violates the norms of\r\nlaw and trade among nations and illegally disregards\r\nthe sovereignty and interests of other countries. On the\r\nother side is the obstinacy of a single actor lacking any\r\nargument to attempt to justify that which the rest of the\r\nworld rejects.\r\nI am certain that we will today adopt the eleventh\r\nresolution on this matter, and that it will have special\r\nsignificance. That significance stems from the fact that\r\nthe text of the draft resolution has genuine unanimous\r\nsupport, including that of the majority of the people of\r\nthe United States and some of its main institutions.\r\nImportant events have taken place in the last year to\r\nillustrate that fact. A very wide segment of civil society\r\nand influential business entities have called for the\r\nlifting of the blockade and for the normalization of\r\neconomic ties with Cuba. American farmers have been\r\nespecially active in that regard, as have been their\r\norganizations and major agricultural production and\r\nexport companies. It is thanks to their efforts that it has\r\nbeen possible to take a few steps that could lead to\r\nsignificant changes in the current policy.\r\nFor the first time in four decades, a number of\r\nAmerican exporters have been able to sell their\r\nproducts to Cuba and to carry out the necessary\r\ntransactions, despite the severe obstacles and\r\ndiscriminatory practices they had to contend with. In\r\nthe course of 11 months, we received over 50 merchant\r\nships transporting 712,000 tons of American\r\nagricultural products. The total cost of those purchases,\r\nincluding their transportation, was $140 million, and\r\nthat figure could reach $200 million with the new\r\npurchases recently negotiated.\r\nThe contracts pertaining to the latter were signed\r\nduring the United States Food and Agribusiness\r\nExhibition held in Havana from 26 to 30 September\r\n2002, which attracted the participation of hundreds of\r\ncompanies from over 33 States. They were joined by\r\nhigh-level Government authorities and business\r\nrepresentatives.\r\nThose sales and that exhibition demonstrated the\r\nconsiderable potential benefits for both countries that\r\nwould result from normal trade relations, as well as the\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nimpressive level of good will and mutual interest on\r\nthe part of both the Cuban people and United States\r\nfarmers. Advances made in that direction would also be\r\nbeneficial for all other nations and for international\r\npeace and cooperation. They also coincide with the\r\naspirations of the Cuban-American community, in\r\nwhich diverse sectors advocate normal relations with\r\ntheir homeland. They are raising their voices in\r\ngrowing numbers against those who attempt to silence\r\nthem with pressures and threats. Their demands were\r\nheard this year in downtown Miami and at the Capitol\r\nin Washington, D.C.\r\nThat constructive spirit has been echoed in the\r\nlegislative bodies of the United States. A bipartisan\r\ngroup has been formed there that has undertaken\r\ninitiatives aimed at changing the current policy and\r\nreplacing it with one that is more congruent with the\r\ngenuine interests of the people of that country and with\r\nthe norms of respect that should govern relations\r\nbetween sovereign States. In their efforts, however,\r\nthey must still contend with the stubborn opposition of\r\na powerful minority.\r\nLast year, the two houses of the United States\r\nCongress passed a bill that would have introduced\r\nimportant modifications to the blockade. Despite the\r\nclear backing received in both houses, the leadership of\r\nthe House of Representatives, violating basic\r\ndemocratic procedures, has adulterated the text of the\r\nbill approved and imposed a formula that openly\r\ncontradicted the will of the majority.\r\nThis summer, the House of Representatives\r\npassed by a wide majority a number of legislative\r\nproposals that would facilitate United States exports\r\nand eliminate the ban on travel to Cuba for United\r\nStates citizens. Those proposals seek to correct\r\nnegative elements arbitrarily imposed last year.\r\nAlthough they do not amount to the complete\r\nelimination of the blockade, they are important steps in\r\nthe right direction, and we welcome them.\r\nPresident Bush, however, had already announced\r\nin advance that he would veto any bill aimed at\r\nmodifying the policy currently in force. On 20 May\r\n2002, in a clearly interventionist and aggressive speech\r\ngiven in Miami, he declared, “The United States will\r\ncontinue to enforce economic sanctions on Cuba.”\r\nThat stance is finding less and less support. The\r\nHouse Republican majority leader, who has always\r\nvoted against Cuba and has been a key element in\r\nlegislative manoeuvres to maintain the blockade,\r\nrecently acknowledged the irrationality of that policy\r\nand its imminent collapse.\r\nThe aforementioned sanctions are also being\r\napplied against entities and citizens of the United\r\nStates. The Bush Administration is not only threatening\r\nto veto bills that have solid backing in both houses and\r\nthat respond to the demands of a large part of the\r\nUnited States population, he is also undertaking actions\r\nthat contradict the express will of legislators and the\r\nlegitimate aspirations of those who have inspired those\r\ninitiatives in Congress. While the latter approve\r\nmeasures that will facilitate trade, the office in charge\r\nof enforcing the blockade is acting in opposition and is\r\nannouncing new requirements and stipulations that\r\nwould be imposed on exporters, thus limiting their\r\nsales. While a majority in Congress has called for\r\nfreedom of travel, the Administration has established\r\nadditional restrictions, it threatens to punish anyone\r\nwho has exercised a right enshrined in the Constitution\r\nand has denied visas to numerous groups of Cuban\r\nartists and intellectuals, to the detriment of important\r\ncultural or scientific activities held in this country.\r\nThe anti-Cuban minority, protected by its\r\nprivileged relations with the current Administration,\r\nacts ever more openly against the true interests of the\r\nUnited States. It has managed to place in high-ranking\r\npositions unscrupulous individuals, professional\r\nslanderers who routinely regurgitate ridiculous lies that\r\nnobody believes and provocative, irresponsible and\r\nfalse statements, to create through such deceit a\r\nbilateral conflict that will allow them to fulfil their\r\nlong-held dream of taking control of the lands, the\r\nhomes and everything else that belongs to the Cuban\r\npeople. Isolated and politically defeated, it continues to\r\nstep up its hostility against Cuba and persist in its plans\r\nto use violence and terrorism against our country.\r\nFive young Cubans were unjustly punished for\r\nacting against well-known terrorist groups that operate\r\nfreely in Miami. They are being treated with\r\nabominable cruelty and are even being deprived of\r\nvisiting rights, along with their families. A new trial to\r\nredress these grave violations of due process has been\r\nrequested by their defence team, with the support of\r\ndistinguished United States jurists. That motion,\r\npresented today to the federal court in southern Florida,\r\ndeserves everyone’s support, as it would allow the re-\r\nestablishment of the rule of law in a case of vital\r\nimportance, since it essentially involves the practical\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nand not merely rhetorical attitude towards terrorism\r\nand its accomplices.\r\nI will not speak at length here about the damage\r\nto our economy or about the grave harm done to the\r\nlives and welfare of all Cubans, nor about the countless\r\nviolations of international norms and the rights of third\r\ncountries arising from the embargo over the course of\r\nfour decades. These are outlined in the documents\r\ndistributed under this agenda item.\r\nThe decision that this Assembly will adopt today\r\nwill provide justice for the Cuban people, who have\r\nsuffered greatly as a consequence of a policy that is\r\nunjust, illegal and contrary to reason and morality. My\r\npeople have stood firm and will continue to do so,\r\nbecause nothing can make them relinquish their\r\nindependence. They will never allow anyone to rob\r\nthem of their national rights or to destroy the work of\r\njustice they have created with self-sacrifice and\r\ntenacity. With its vote, the Assembly will also be\r\ndefending all those States whose sovereignty and\r\nlegitimate interests are being crushed by those who\r\narrogate powers that no one has ceded to them and who\r\nattempt, with no right whatsoever, to dictate rules to\r\nthe entire world and to enforce their application beyond\r\ntheir own borders.\r\nThe draft resolution that I have the honour of\r\nintroducing, and which we will undoubtedly adopt\r\ntoday, will also indicate support for the noble people of\r\nthe United States and for all those in that country who\r\nare striving to change a policy that the world\r\ncondemns, that is irrational and unjustifiable, and the\r\nfailure of which is already an historical fact.\r\nMr. Manis (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\ninternational community’s support for and adherence to\r\nthe principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter\r\nare among the most important duties of States towards\r\nthe achievement of a world community of cooperation\r\nand brotherhood in which States respect the choices\r\nmade by people in striving to attain their social,\r\neconomic and cultural development.\r\nOn 16 October, the General Assembly concluded\r\nits discussion of agenda item 31, in which the\r\ninternational community expressed its refutation of all\r\nforms of hegemony and interference in the fates of\r\npeoples and its deep concern over the negative impact\r\nof unilaterally imposed extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures on trade and financial and\r\neconomic cooperation, including at the regional level,\r\nbecause they are contrary to recognized principles of\r\ninternational law. Resolution 57/5, which 133 Members\r\nvoted in favour of, also confirmed the rights of peoples\r\nto self-determination and called upon States not to\r\nrecognize or apply unilateral extraterritorial coercive\r\neconomic measures or laws imposed by any State.\r\nThis was not the first resolution adopted on this\r\ntopic. We recall by way of example resolutions 55/6,\r\n53/10 and 51/17. The heads of State of the Non-\r\nAligned Movement, at their summits in Durban and\r\nHavana, and the foreign ministers of the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference at their meetings in New\r\nYork condemned attempts to impose economic\r\nsanctions on some developing countries aimed at\r\npreventing them from exercising their political rights.\r\nSuch sanctions have extraterritorial effects in the\r\naffairs of some developing countries, since they extend\r\nto companies, the private sector and individuals.\r\nWe have now resumed for the eleventh time our\r\nconsideration of agenda item 26, entitled “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”. It will be recalled that 167 members of\r\nthe General Assembly voted last year in favour of\r\nresolution 56/9 on this issue, thus reflecting the\r\ninternational community’s increasing awareness of the\r\ndanger of imposing unjust sanctions on Member States.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its total rejection of the\r\nembargo imposed by the United States on the Republic\r\nof Cuba and its brotherly people. The people of Cuba\r\nhave suffered enough from the fallout of these policies,\r\nthe economic repercussions of which have cost them\r\nsome $70 billion over the course of the past 40 years.\r\nSix of every 10 Cubans live in difficult economic\r\ncircumstances due to the embargo and sanctions.\r\nMy country and my people suffer under unilateral\r\nsanctions imposed against us by the same country that\r\nimposes them on friendly Cuba, as do the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran and the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In\r\nthis regard, we would refer to a law recently enacted by\r\nthe United States Congress, known as the Sudan Peace\r\nAct. Under this Act, certain biased measures are\r\nundertaken in favour of the Sudanese rebel movement.\r\nThe Act contains flimsy and erroneous information\r\nderived from certain circles that harbour grudges\r\nagainst the Sudan and its people. It reflects yet again\r\nthe United States desire to impose its hegemony, to\r\npursue the policies of isolation and imposition, and to\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\ntake the law into its own hands. These policies are now\r\na part of history in the new civilized world entering the\r\nthird millennium.\r\nIn conclusion, we call upon all States to vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution submitted by the\r\nRepublic of Cuba, entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. We\r\nurge them to voice their strong opposition to such\r\nunilateral measures in flagrant violation of\r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter.\r\nMr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): The issue\r\nof economic, trade and financial embargo against Cuba\r\nthat was imposed more than 40 years ago is a source of\r\nserious ongoing concern to the international\r\ncommunity, which has repeatedly expressed its\r\ndisapproval regarding this practice.\r\nLast year the General Assembly again took a\r\nstand, with an overwhelming majority in favour of\r\nlifting this embargo that violates the goals and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter, including the\r\nsovereign equality of States, non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of other States, as well as the relevant\r\nnorms governing international relations.\r\nThere are many international institutions that, like\r\nthe United Nations, reject the resort to coercive,\r\nunilateral, extraterritorial economic measures for the\r\npurpose of exercising political and economic pressure\r\nagainst States. This is demonstrated by the large\r\nsupport given to the issue of lifting the embargo\r\nagainst Cuba. For example, in the final communiqué\r\napproved by the fourteenth ministerial meeting of the\r\nNon-Aligned Movement, held in Durban last April, the\r\nministers appealed again for an end to the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which\r\nnot only violates the United Nations Charter,\r\ninternational law and the principle of good neighbourly\r\nrelations, but also imposes great material and economic\r\ndamage on the Cuban people.\r\nOn this occasion, the ministers of the Non-\r\nAligned countries also urged again the strict\r\napplication of the relevant General Assembly\r\nresolutions, which include resolution A/56/9, adopted\r\non 27 November 2001. They also expressed their deep\r\nconcern over the expansion of the extraterritorial\r\nnature of this embargo applied against Cuba and the\r\ncontinued adoption of legislative measures aimed at\r\nstrengthening the embargo.\r\nAlong the same lines, other international bodies,\r\nsuch as the Group of 77 and China, the Organization of\r\nAmerican States, the Rio Group, the Ibero-American\r\nSummit, the Latin American Association of Integration\r\nand the South Summit, have also served as forums in\r\nwhich concerned States opposed this embargo because\r\nit violates the principles that govern peaceful co-\r\nexistence, weakens multilateralism and is counter to\r\nthe spirit of cooperation and friendship among peoples.\r\nThis underscores how much the issue of lifting the\r\nembargo against Cuba has met with the support of the\r\ninternational community, while, at the same time,\r\nadvocates of this practice maintain their position.\r\nLike most countries of the world, Togo maintains\r\nexcellent friendly relations with Cuba, based on\r\ncooperation and solidarity, and has firmly and\r\nconstantly stood by this country to call for the total\r\nnon-selective compliance of the principles and norms\r\nof international law.\r\nIt is Togo’s conviction that each nation — large\r\nor small, rich or poor — has a right to freely select its\r\npolitical, economical, social and cultural system. For\r\nthis reason Togo never fails to express its disapproval\r\nover the practice of using coercive economic measures\r\nto bring political and economic pressure to bear against\r\nStates. Togo, therefore, urges that the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo unfairly imposed\r\nagainst Cuba, and which continues to cause untold\r\nsuffering for the Cuban people, particularly children\r\nand the elderly, cease without delay.\r\nIn spite of the demands made repeatedly by the\r\ninternational community to end the embargo against\r\nCuba, at a time when we would expect that the\r\nadvocates of this position to finally work at meeting\r\nthis requirement, it is distressing to note that they are\r\nnot ready to abandon the policy of coercion that they\r\npractice against a neighbouring State. Even worse,\r\nsome senior officials of the country that initiated this\r\nembargo recently declared that it will be maintained\r\nand even strengthened. One wonders why there is such\r\nresolve and blind obstinacy by those who advocate this\r\nembargo. They allege to have the absolute truth and are\r\nright where everybody else is wrong.\r\nToday, we can acknowledge that this policy of\r\ncoercion imposed at the height of the cold war no\r\nlonger serves even the interests of domestic policy; it is\r\nclear that the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo is a disservice to the interests of the initiator\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\ncountry itself and that it also considerably harms the\r\nCuban population.\r\nIn terms of the Cuban people, the repercussions\r\nof the embargo affect all sectors of activity in terms of\r\nsocial and economic life, particularly in the areas of\r\nhealth, food and equipment. From this standpoint,\r\nmany speakers before us, from this rostrum, have\r\nhighlighted clearly and with detail the suffering of the\r\nCuban people as a result of the embargo.\r\nThe delegation of Togo will not revisit the\r\nrepercussions of the tragedy of the Cuban people. We\r\nnote however, that according to the estimates of the\r\nCuban Government, the economic damage of more\r\nthan 40 years of this policy, amounts to more than the\r\nastronomical sum of $70 billion with regard to the\r\ncountry that perpetuates this embargo.\r\nWe emphasize that Cuba, whose population is\r\nestimated to about 11 million people and which located\r\nseveral dozen kilometres from the coast of the State in\r\nquestion, should clearly be a special source of markets\r\nfor the manufactured goods of that country. This is\r\ndemonstrated by events such as the first United States\r\nfood products fair that was organized last September in\r\nHavana; it contributed to moving Cuba from 228th\r\nplace on the list of trade partners in that country to\r\n42nd place. It especially attests to the weariness of\r\nbusinessmen and exporters in the United States who\r\nrealize that they have every interest in maintaining\r\ntrade relations with Cuba.\r\nSimilarly, in some political circles of that country,\r\nthere is increasing awareness that the embargo has\r\nbecome outmoded and that there is a need to work to\r\nsimply lift it. This was demonstrated by the recent visit\r\nof President Jimmy Carter to Havana. This, at any rate\r\nis the firm hope of Togo.\r\nMr. Swe (Myanmar): Myanmar fully subscribes\r\nto the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, especially the principle of\r\nsovereign equality of nations. It strongly believes that,\r\nas prescribed in the Charter, Member countries should\r\npractice tolerance and live together in peace with one\r\nanother as good neighbours. As a co-initiator of the\r\nFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Myanmar also\r\nfirmly believes that only through peaceful coexistence\r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of countries\r\ncan the international community nurture and establish\r\npeace and security.\r\nWe are also of the opinion that promulgating\r\ndomestic legislation that will affect the sovereignty of\r\nother States and the legitimate interests of entities or\r\npersons under their jurisdiction is not conducive to the\r\ndevelopment of friendly relations among nations.\r\nAccordingly, Myanmar, like many other Members of\r\nthe United Nations, is opposed to any domestic\r\nlegislation that will have extraterritorial effects, such as\r\nthe Cuban Democracy Act, the Torricelli Act and the\r\nHelms-Burton Act.\r\nWe have therefore consistently voted in favour of\r\nthe resolution on the necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba since the\r\nresolution was first introduced in the General\r\nAssembly during the forty-sixth session in 1991. And\r\nwe shall do so again this year.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nagainst Cuba has been imposed for over 40 years now.\r\nIt has done much harm to the people of Cuba,\r\nespecially the most vulnerable groups such as the\r\nelderly, women and children. We do not consider that\r\nthe embargo serves any useful purpose. It not only\r\nprevents the people of the two countries concerned\r\nfrom interacting culturally, socially and economically\r\nbut also has an extraterritorial effect that deters other\r\ncountries from making fruitful engagements with the\r\npeople of Cuba. I join many speakers who spoke before\r\nme in calling for the lifting of the embargo against\r\nCuba.\r\nMyanmar firmly believes that differences among\r\nMember States of the United Nations should be settled\r\nby peaceful means through dialogue and negotiations.\r\nIn this respect, we are encouraged to see some positive\r\ndevelopments in recent years in the relations between\r\nthe United States and Cuba, such as the resumption of\r\ndirect flights to Cuba, food exports to Cuba and, more\r\nrecently, the visit of Nobel Laureate and former\r\nPresident Jimmy Carter, to Havana. We hope that those\r\nengagements will in the end lead to the normalization\r\nof relations between the United States and Cuba, which\r\nwe believe will be in the best interests of both peoples.\r\nIt will also be of benefit in establishing peace and\r\nstability in the region of Central America and the\r\nCaribbean.\r\nMr. Musambachime (Zambia): Allow me to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\r\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. My\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\ndelegation is confident that you will steer the work of\r\nthe Assembly in the right direction. We also thank your\r\npredecessor for the efficient manner in which he\r\npresided over the work of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation also wants to welcome the\r\nstatement by Ricardo Alarcón de Quesada, President of\r\nthe Cuban People’s Power National Assembly, in\r\nwhich he introduced the draft resolution contained in\r\nA/57/L.5. His presence in the Assembly demonstrates\r\nbeyond reasonable doubt Cuba’s seriousness in its\r\ndesire to resolve the issue under agenda item 26.\r\nAllow me also to commend the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report contained in documents A/57/264 and\r\nA/57/264/Add.1, entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba.” The\r\nreport provides us with insight into the implementation\r\nof resolution 56/9 of 27 November 2001 by Member\r\nStates, bearing in mind the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law.\r\nI also wish to commend the Cuban delegation for\r\nintroducing draft resolution A/57/L.5 on this very\r\nimportant subject.\r\nMy delegation wishes to state from the outset that\r\nits position on this issue remains unchanged. In the ten\r\nyears that this resolution has been tabled in the General\r\nAssembly, Zambia has always voted in the affirmative.\r\nWe will once again vote in its favour.\r\nOur decision on this matter is based on our firm\r\nbelief in the principles enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations, based, inter alia, on the sovereign\r\nequality of States and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other States. Zambia’s foreign policy\r\nembraces those principles and, in addition, promotes\r\nhuman rights, fundamental freedoms and the peaceful\r\ncoexistence of States.\r\nIt is in that context that my delegation views the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\non Cuba as a breach of international law and a\r\nviolation of the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter. The extraterritoriality of the Helms-Burton\r\nAct and Torricelli Act infringes upon the sovereignty\r\nof other States and is an impediment to international\r\nnavigation and free trade as reflected in the agreements\r\nand decisions of the World Trade Organization.\r\nI wish to state that my delegation is deeply\r\nconcerned by the negative effects of the embargo on\r\nthe Cuban people, particularly children, women and the\r\nelderly. It is clear that in spite of the efforts by the\r\nGovernment and people of Cuba, the embargo has\r\nlimited the nation’s economic and social development.\r\nThis unfortunate situation undermines the\r\ncommitments of our leaders in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, adopted here in New York on 8 September\r\n2000. The common vision shared by United Nations\r\nMembers of a more peaceful, prosperous and just\r\nworld in which all human beings can live better and\r\nsafer lives has been denied to the Cuban people. In\r\nview of those humanitarian considerations, my\r\ndelegation requests the international community to\r\nredouble its efforts aimed at an early lifting of the\r\neconomic embargo against Cuba, which has only\r\nserved to hurt the most vulnerable groups in that\r\ncountry.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to appeal to Member States\r\nto support the noble principles that are enshrined in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter by a unanimous vote for the\r\ncomplete lifting, without conditions, of the embargo\r\nagainst Cuba. We hope that this eleventh resolution on\r\nthe embargo will be the last one to be considered by the\r\nAssembly in order to allow the Cuban people to be\r\nfully engaged in international affairs.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I have the honour today to\r\nspeak on behalf of the 14 member States of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) that are Members\r\nof the United Nations. We join those Member States\r\nthat have spoken previously in support of the need to\r\nbring to an end the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nCARICOM member States wish to reaffirm the\r\nimportance that they attach to the strict observance of\r\nthe principles of international law and to freedom of\r\ntrade and navigation. We remain opposed to the\r\nextraterritorial application of national legislation that\r\nseeks to impose artificial barriers to trade and\r\ncooperation and that is contrary to the principle of the\r\nsovereign equality of States.\r\nOur member States, in keeping with our policy of\r\nmutual respect, good-neighbourliness and respect for\r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nhave maintained friendly relations with Cuba, and we\r\nhave developed mutually beneficial programmes of\r\ncooperation and trade. CARICOM member States also\r\nenjoy traditional, warm and friendly relations with the\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nUnited States, and in that spirit, we call for a\r\nconstructive process of dialogue and a normalization of\r\nrelations, which we believe would be in the interests of\r\nall parties. That would remove a source of tension and\r\nconflict and would improve the prospects for peaceful\r\ndevelopment in our region.\r\nThe CARICOM delegations support the contents\r\nof the draft resolution that is before the General\r\nAssembly, and we will vote in favour of its adoption.\r\nMr. Ivanou (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): In the\r\ncourse of the fifty-sixth session of the General\r\nAssembly, the Republic of Belarus, together with the\r\noverwhelming majority of other Member States, voted\r\nin favour of resolution 56/9, entitled “Necessity of\r\nending the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America\r\nagainst Cuba”. The Republic of Belarus thus reaffirmed\r\nits commitment to respect for the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the sovereign equality of States, non-\r\ninterference in internal affairs and freedom of\r\ninternational trade and navigation.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus has consistently\r\nsupported the invalidation of laws and measures\r\nunilaterally promulgated and applied by Member States\r\nthat have extraterritorial effects on the sovereignty of\r\nother States, on the legitimate interests of entities or\r\npersons under the jurisdiction of those States and on\r\nfreedom of trade and navigation. In accordance with\r\nthe fundamental principles of international law,\r\nincluding the provisions of the Charter of the United\r\nNations, the Republic of Belarus has never applied,\r\ndoes not currently apply and has no intention of ever\r\napplying any such laws or measures. The Republic of\r\nBelarus believes that international disputes must be\r\nresolved only through negotiations, on the basis of\r\nrespect for the principles of equality and mutual\r\nbenefit.\r\nMr. Andjaba (Namibia): On numerous\r\noccasions, the Government of Namibia has expressed\r\nits displeasure at the continuous unilateral economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed on the\r\nGovernment and the people of Cuba by the United\r\nStates of America for more than 40 years. Similarly, for\r\nseveral consecutive years now, the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States of the United Nations have\r\nexpressed their views on this matter, clearly\r\nacknowledging the invalidity of the application of\r\nmeasures with extraterritorial effects. Yet, instead of\r\nefforts aimed at ending the embargo, what we have\r\nseen recently is a further strengthening of the embargo\r\nand of the Helms-Burton Act, which has enhanced its\r\nextraterritorial nature.\r\nFor its part, Namibia has repeatedly and\r\nconsistently advocated an end to this economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo, because we firmly\r\nbelieve that the Helms-Burton Act and the D’Amato\r\nlegislation are contrary to international law and violate\r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThose measures are not only irrelevant, but also\r\ncontrary to the spirit of much-discussed globalization,\r\nwhich has been so much discussed, as well as to\r\npeaceful coexistence and free trade.\r\nThe negative impact of the embargo on the people\r\nof Cuba — especially on women and children — is\r\nwell documented. Furthermore, the embargo continues\r\nto have a negative impact on Cuba’s economic\r\ndevelopment and has made it extremely difficult for the\r\ncountry to purchase the food, medicine, fuel and raw\r\nmaterials that are needed to sustain the lives of the\r\nCuban people. We continue to ask: how much more\r\nsuffering will the people of Cuba endure, and how\r\nmany more lives will be lost as a result of the\r\nunavailability of basic medicines and medical\r\nequipment, before this unjustifiable embargo is lifted?\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Namibia\r\ncontinues to uphold the principles of the sovereignty of\r\nStates and non-interference in the internal affairs of\r\nother States. Furthermore, it is our view that it is right\r\nfor the international community to continue to reject\r\nthe unilateral embargo against the people of Cuba. In\r\nthat regard, we call for the immediate and\r\nunconditional lifting of the embargo against Cuba.\r\nFor those reasons, my delegation will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/57/L.5.\r\nMr. Mwakawago (United Republic of Tanzania):\r\nMy delegation would like to make a contribution to the\r\nitem under consideration by the Assembly on the\r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against\r\nCuba.\r\nThe United Nations Charter asserts that the\r\npurpose of our Organization is, as stated in Article 1,\r\nparagraph 2, “To develop friendly relations among\r\nnations based on respect for the principle of equal\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nrights and self-determination of peoples, and to take\r\nother appropriate measures to strengthen universal\r\npeace”. In this context, the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States\r\nGovernment against Cuba is a serious negation of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter both in letter and spirit.\r\nUnilateral embargoes have the tendency of\r\ncreating antagonistic relations that could lead to enmity\r\namong States. Depending on the intensity of enmity\r\nand power relations, it is conceivable relations could\r\ndegenerate into war thus threatening international\r\npeace and security.\r\nThe embargo and blockade imposed against the\r\nRepublic of Cuba for the past four decades have\r\nseriously violated, not only the fundamental principles\r\nof the United Nations Charter and international law, but\r\nthe freedom of international trade and navigation.\r\nIndeed, such unilateral measures run counter to the\r\ncommon desires of States to build sound international\r\nrelations on the basis of equality and the right of every\r\npeople to determine their political and economic\r\nsystems. It is instructive to note that during that period,\r\nCuba has managed, under very difficult conditions, to\r\ninstitute world class health and educational systems. It\r\nis our conviction that those achievements would have\r\nbeen greater if there were no embargo or blockade and\r\nthe world would have been a better place for such\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the era of globalization, the accent is on open\r\nborders and rule-based trade relations. Unilateral\r\ncoercive measures not only run counter to the spirit of\r\nthe times, but work against the very essence of\r\nglobalization.\r\nTanzania was encouraged by the bilateral\r\nnegotiations between the two countries that covered\r\nimmigration issues. We felt that was a good start.\r\nHowever, there has been no movement on easing\r\nrestrictions. On the contrary, there have been assertions\r\nthat the embargo would be rigorously enforced.\r\nWe are concerned about the negative effects of\r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo\r\nimposed on the Cuban population. Therefore, there is\r\nan urgent need for the embargo to be lifted once and\r\nfor all. The United Nations Charter provides for\r\nMember States to seek to resolve disputes through\r\ndialogue and negotiation in a spirit of mutual respect\r\nfor the independence, sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of nations. Today the world is faced with\r\nvarious problems which transcend boundaries and\r\nideologies and call for urgent joint efforts. The world\r\nhas yet to come to grips with environmental\r\ndegradation, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, drug trafficking,\r\nterrorism and organized crime. These are but a few\r\nareas where the two countries could work together\r\ndespite their differences and contribute not only to the\r\nwell-being of their citizens, but to the well-being of\r\nhumanity at large.\r\nTanzania believes that international relations\r\nshould be based on the principles of international law\r\nwhich call for peaceful co-existence among nations and\r\nprohibit the threat or use of force in international\r\nrelations. Coercive measures in this regard are\r\ncounterproductive. The sooner they are ended, the\r\nbetter for international concord.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation hopes that given the\r\noverwhelming appeal by the international community\r\nfor unilateral measures to be stopped, the United States\r\nGovernment will revisit its position in the interests of\r\ndialogue and cooperation. It is in that spirit that my\r\ndelegation will vote for the resolution.\r\nMr. Salman (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): I will make\r\na brief statement. Since its forty-seventh session the\r\nGeneral Assembly has been considering the item\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States against Cuba”. It has also adopted\r\nnumerous resolutions calling upon States to adhere to\r\nthe United Nations Charter and the norms of\r\ninternational law and urging them to refrain from\r\nimposing extraterritorial laws and measures.\r\nWhile the international community expected a\r\npositive response from the United States to those\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, successive American\r\nadministrations have moved in the opposite\r\ndirection — tightening their economic embargo against\r\nCuba. The economic embargo against Cuba has created\r\nimmense difficulties for the Cuban people in its\r\nattempts to achieve socio-economic development. It\r\nhas also seriously sapped the efforts of Cuba to\r\neliminate poverty and upgrade the standard of living.\r\nThis constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights\r\nand furnishes categorical proof refuting American\r\nallegations of respect for international law and the\r\ninstruments governing relations among nations.\r\nAmerica’s insistence on pursuing its policy of\r\nblockading Cuba, boycotting it and undermining its\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\npolitical stability and impeding the efforts of its people\r\nto achieve development runs counter to the purposes of\r\nthe United Nations, the norms of international law, the\r\nCharter of Economic Rights and Duties of States and\r\nall aspirations to the establishment of a world governed\r\nby cooperation and mutual respect.\r\nAmerican authorities have attempted to justify\r\ntheir embargo against Cuba as an element of their\r\npolicy of promoting democracy in Cuba. They have\r\neven gone farther than that by affirming that lifting the\r\nsanctions against Cuba is contingent upon regime\r\nchange there. They say the same thing about Iraq.\r\nThe use of economic sanctions with a view to\r\nchanging the political systems of the targeted countries\r\nundermines the very basis of international relations and\r\ntakes the world back to the law of the jungle.\r\nWe call on the United States of America to refrain\r\nfrom imposing economic sanctions against peoples and\r\nto favour the logic of cooperation and dialogue over\r\nthat of force, in accordance with the norms of\r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United\r\nNations, because experience has shown that economic\r\nsanctions are not only inhuman but ineffective and\r\nhave terrible consequences for innocent civilians.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): This is the eleventh consecutive time that the\r\nGeneral Assembly has discussed the item under\r\nconsideration, entitled “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nAt the past 10 debates on this issue, the majority\r\nof Members of the Organization rejected the\r\npromulgation or application by any State of any law\r\naffecting the sovereignty of other States, and urged all\r\nStates to refrain from promulgating and applying such\r\nlaws and to repeal those that have already been\r\nenacted.\r\nRegrettably, the United States has not abandoned\r\nthis approach, which is publicly condemned and\r\nrejected by its conventional allies and trade partners.\r\nWorse still, a number of members of the American\r\nAdministration have adopted additional measures by\r\nwhich they tightened the blockade against Cuba and\r\nexpanded their coercive laws, such as the infamous\r\n“Helms-Burton Act”, which provides for measures to\r\nbe taken against firms, corporations and Governments\r\nof third countries that have financial, trade or economic\r\nrelations with Cuba. Given the adoption by the General\r\nAssembly of a number of resolutions, most recently\r\nresolution 56/9, this can only be a deliberate effort by\r\nthe United States to disregard the appeals of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWashington is trying to impose specific economic\r\nand political policies on States and peoples. Those who\r\ndo not accept them are subjected to blockades and\r\nboycotts, such as those imposed by the Security\r\nCouncil and international financial institutions such as\r\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\r\nThe strict blockade imposed against Cuba by the\r\nUnited States of America for more than four decades\r\nnow has had serious consequences for the Cuban\r\npeople. This has been made clear in a number of\r\nreports, such as that contained in document A/57/264.\r\nThe blockade has limited the Cubans’ ability to import\r\nfood and has made it difficult to acquire medical\r\nequipment and medicines to treat the ill. Such practices\r\nand the resultant suffering of the Cuban people — in\r\nparticular the most vulnerable groups, such as children\r\nand the elderly — represent a blatant violation of\r\nhuman rights and refute the claim that America\r\nrespects international law and instruments that govern\r\nrelations among nations. This exposes the true nature\r\nof the American approach: blockading peoples and\r\npunishing other States, as well as trade partners,\r\ncompanies and individuals, to prevent them from\r\ndealing with those States on which blockades have\r\nbeen imposed by the American Government — actions\r\nthat run counter to international legal instruments.\r\nThe American authorities have tried to justify\r\ntheir blockade against Cuba, but this cannot be done.\r\nThis flagrant interference in the internal affairs of the\r\nCuban people is intended to impose certain specific\r\npolicies on Cuba.\r\nThese actions are in line with the many coercive\r\nmeasures and sanctions that have been imposed on a\r\nnumber of States, including my own. Unilateral\r\nsanctions have been imposed for almost two decades in\r\nthe area of financial, educational and technical\r\nactivities. We are surprised at the conduct of the United\r\nStates vis-à-vis the Cuban people because of its choice\r\nof a certain political and economic system. Similarly, it\r\nis easy to refute the pretexts used by the United States\r\nin imposing sanctions against Libya, the Sudan and\r\nIran. This is a ready-made formula that is imposed on\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nany people that defends its dignity and insists on\r\nmaking its own choices.\r\nThe imposition of sanctions and blockades is no\r\nway to resolve differences among States. General\r\nAssembly resolutions and the Charter of the United\r\nNations provide for the resolution of disputes on the\r\nbasis of dialogue, negotiations, full equality, mutual\r\nrespect and non-interference in internal affairs.\r\nCuba has consistently expressed its desire to\r\nresolve its problems with the United States on these\r\nbases. Neither Cuba nor any State on which American\r\nsanctions have been imposed has any interest in\r\nantagonizing the United States. All States should abide\r\nby the Charter and resort to the peaceful means\r\nprovided therein and in other international instruments.\r\nThese must be complied with; we should abide by the\r\nnorms of international law.\r\nWe must send a clear-cut message that will help\r\nto bring about a comprehensive peace and friendly\r\nrelations among States that are based on mutual respect\r\nfor the sovereignty of States, regardless of their size or\r\nof the econo-political system that they themselves have\r\nchosen.\r\nFor these reasons, my delegation will vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/57/L.5.\r\nMr. Muchetwa (Zimbabwe): We are once again\r\nconsidering agenda item 26, “Necessity of ending the\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”, which\r\nwe think should have been done long ago. We cannot\r\nconceal our dismay at the failure by a few of our\r\nMembers to ease the inhuman treatment being meted\r\nout to other States.\r\nZimbabwe considers that unilateral measures\r\nsuch as the embargo imposed on Cuba, which is of a\r\ncoercive and extraterritorial nature, have an adverse\r\nimpact on the legal framework defining economic and\r\ncommercial exchanges between nations, and undermine\r\nthe efforts that have been made to achieve continental\r\nand subregional economic integration.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/9 of\r\n27 November 2001 once again expressed concern at the\r\nformulation and application by Member States of laws\r\nand regulations such as that promulgated on 12 March\r\n1996 known as the “Helms-Burton Act”, the\r\nextraterritorial effects of which affect the sovereignty\r\nof other States, the legitimate interests of entities or\r\npersons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of\r\ntrade and navigation. The resolution once again urges\r\nthose States that have and continue to apply such laws\r\nand measures to take the necessary steps to repeal or\r\ninvalidate them. In that regard, Zimbabwe’s legal\r\nsystem does not recognize the validity of the\r\napplication of measures with extraterritorial effects.\r\nCompanies located in Zimbabwe are subject\r\nexclusively to Zimbabwean legislation.\r\nMeasures by any country which violate the\r\nprovisions of resolution 56/9 and which attempt to\r\ncompel citizens of a third country to obey foreign\r\nlegislation, affect the interests of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole and violate generally accepted\r\nprinciples of international law. They should be\r\nreviewed and changed where appropriate in order to\r\nbring them into conformity with international law.\r\nWe believe that differences and problems existing\r\nbetween countries should be resolved through peaceful\r\ndialogue and negotiation on the basis of equality. The\r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed\r\nby the United States of America against Cuba, which\r\nhas lasted for so long, serves no purpose other than to\r\nkeep tensions between the two neighbouring countries\r\nhigh and to inflict tremendous hardship and suffering\r\non the Cuban people, especially women and children.\r\nThe embargo, which remains in force, seriously\r\njeopardizes the legitimate rights and interests of Cuba\r\nand other States, as well as freedom of trade and\r\nnavigation, and should, in accordance with the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions, be brought to an end.\r\nMy delegation will therefore support draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.5, which is before us, and we urge\r\nother peace-loving members to support it also.\r\nMr. Nakkari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in\r\nArabic): The principles and purposes of the Charter\r\nreaffirm the right of States to sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity and to non-intervention in their\r\ninternal affairs. All Members of the United Nations,\r\nand the major Powers in particular, are supposed to\r\ndemonstrate respect for the Charter, which is the\r\nconstitution of the Organization and sets out its\r\ndefinitive terms of reference. The embargo that has\r\nbeen imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years has done\r\na great deal of economic, political and social harm, and\r\nhas worsened the suffering of the Cuban people,\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nespecially that of children and the elderly. The embargo\r\nhas also had a negative effect on the ongoing efforts of\r\nthe Cuban people to achieve well-being and prosperity.\r\nMy delegation pays tribute to Cuba for expressing\r\nits readiness to bring about the lifting of the embargo\r\nthrough dialogue. We support Cuba’s sincere call for\r\nthe holding of constructive dialogue with the United\r\nStates in order to settle all the differences and disputes\r\nbetween the two sides, on the basis of the sovereignty\r\nequality of States, mutual respect, non-intervention in\r\nthe internal affairs of States and respect for the\r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and the\r\nprinciples of good-neighbourliness.\r\nMy delegation believes that normalization of\r\nrelations between the United States and Cuba would\r\ncertainly serve the interests of the peoples of both\r\ncountries. My delegation would like to reaffirm the\r\nright of peoples freely to choose their economic,\r\npolitical, social and cultural systems, in accordance\r\nwith international law.\r\nThe international community’s increasing support\r\nfor lifting the embargo imposed on Cuba is a\r\nreaffirmation of the need to respect the economic,\r\nsocial and political system chosen freely by a State in\r\naccordance with the interests that it considers\r\nappropriate. In this respect, we would like to refer to\r\nthe ministerial declaration of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, adopted at Cartagena, Colombia, which\r\ncalled upon the United States to put an end to the\r\nembargo imposed on Cuba because it contravenes the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, international law and\r\nthe principles of good-neighbourliness.\r\nWe would like to refer to the agreement among\r\ndeveloping countries reached at the South Summit of\r\nthe Group of 77 and China, held at Havana, which\r\ncategorically rejected the imposition of any rules or\r\nregulations with extraterritorial effects and of any\r\ncoercive economic measures. During that Summit deep\r\nconcern was expressed about the negative effects of\r\neconomic sanctions on the development capability of\r\ntargeted countries, and a special appeal was made, on\r\nbehalf of all the leaders of the developing countries, for\r\nthe immediate lifting of the embargo imposed on Cuba.\r\nThe international community has continued to\r\nexpress its rejection of unilateral sanctions and of their\r\nexpansion through legislation such as the Helms-\r\nBurton Act, which is extraterritorial in character and\r\nwhich violates the sovereignty of other States that deal\r\nwith Cuba. This contravenes the principle of equal\r\nsovereignty among States. Experience has shown that\r\nthe sanctions system causes enormous material losses\r\nand does economic harm to civilians in targeted\r\ncountries.\r\nMy delegation therefore hopes that all forms of\r\nembargo imposed by the United States on Cuba will be\r\nlifted. We also hope that the United States will heed the\r\nvoice of the international community, as expressed in\r\nthe General Assembly and in other forums. On that\r\nbasis, Syria will vote in favour of draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.5.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nthe debate. We will now proceed to consider draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.5.\r\nI shall now give the floor to those representatives\r\nwho wish to speak in explanation of vote before the\r\nvoting.\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Nakata (Japan): Japan shares the concerns\r\nexpressed by many delegations today regarding the\r\nextraterritorial application of jurisdiction arising from\r\nthe Helms-Burton Act of the United States, which is\r\nlikely to run counter to international law. My\r\nGovernment has been closely following the\r\nimplementation of the legislation, as well as the\r\ncircumstances surrounding it, and our concerns remain\r\nunchanged. For that reason, my delegation will vote in\r\nfavour of draft resolution A/57/L.5.\r\nWhile Japan supports the draft resolution, it has\r\nsome doubt as to whether the General Assembly is in\r\nfact the most suitable forum in which to address the\r\nvery complex issue of the United States embargo\r\nagainst Cuba. Japan believes that it is desirable for\r\nboth countries to seek a solution through bilateral\r\ndialogue. We therefore call upon them to strengthen\r\nefforts towards that end.\r\nMr. Rim Song Chol (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea): My delegation is taking the floor\r\nto explain its position before the vote on draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.5, which was submitted by the\r\ndelegation of Cuba. To oppose the imposition of\r\nunilateral sanctions on that sovereign State is the\r\nconsistent position of the Government of our Republic.\r\nThe unilateral and extraterritorial sanctions imposed by\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nthe United States against Cuba are a result of the\r\nhostile United States policy against Cuba, which seeks\r\nto change that country’s political, economic and social\r\nsystem and which constitutes a violation of the\r\nprinciples of respect for the sovereign equality of\r\nStates, non-intervention and non-interference in their\r\ninternal affairs, and freedom of international trade and\r\nnavigation, embodied in the Charter of the United\r\nNations and in international law. The United States\r\nsanctions against Cuba have a negative impact on the\r\nlives of the Cuban people, obstruct economic\r\ndevelopment, impede the rights to life and development\r\nand cause damage to third countries that have\r\neconomic and trade relations with Cuba.\r\nIn that context, my delegation strongly urges the\r\nUnited States to end the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba at the earliest possible\r\ndate, in conformity with the demands of the\r\ninternational community. We will therefore vote in\r\nfavour of the draft resolution.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nexplanation of vote before the vote.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.5.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,\r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia,\r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain,\r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize,\r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nBotswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria,\r\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon,\r\nCanada, Cape Verde, Chad, Chile, China,\r\nColombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia,\r\nCuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica,\r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial\r\nGuinea, Eritrea, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France,\r\nGabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana,\r\nGreece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-\r\nBissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary,\r\nIceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic\r\nof), Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan,\r\nKazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon,\r\nLesotho, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein,\r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives,\r\nMali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico,\r\nMonaco, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar,\r\nNamibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands, New\r\nZealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan,\r\nPanama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru,\r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of\r\nKorea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian\r\nFederation, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint\r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa,\r\nSan Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi\r\nArabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,\r\nSingapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands,\r\nSomalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan,\r\nSuriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland,\r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago,\r\nTunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda,\r\nUkraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom\r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Vanuatu,\r\nVenezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Yugoslavia,\r\nZambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, Marshall Islands, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nEthiopia, Malawi, Nicaragua, Uzbekistan\r\nDraft resolution A/57/L.5 was adopted by 173\r\nvotes to 3, with 4 abstentions (resolution 57/11).\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to\r\nspeakers in explanation of vote on the resolution just\r\nadopted, may I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Moesby (Denmark): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The countries\r\nof Central and Eastern Europe associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nof Cyprus and Malta, as well as the European Free\r\nTrade Association countries of the European Economic\r\nArea Iceland and Norway align themselves with this\r\nexplanation of vote.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nI have the honour to take the floor on behalf of\r\nthe European Union with reference to the resolution\r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. The European\r\nUnion believes that the United States trade policy\r\ntowards Cuba is primarily a bilateral issue. However,\r\nthe European Union would like to reiterate its\r\nopposition to the extraterritorial aspect of the United\r\nStates embargo that has been implemented in\r\naccordance with the Cuban Democracy Act, of 1992,\r\nand the Helms-Burton Act, of 1996.\r\nThe European Union cannot accept that its\r\neconomic and commercial relations with third countries\r\nshould be restricted through unilateral measures\r\nimposed by the United States on specific countries, in\r\nthis case on Cuba. Therefore, in November 1996 the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of the European Union adopted a\r\nregulation and a joint action aimed at protecting the\r\ninterests of natural or legal persons from the European\r\nUnion against the extraterritorial effects of the Helms-\r\nBurton Act.\r\nIt was encouraging that, during their summit in\r\nLondon in 1998, the European Union and the United\r\nStates agreed on a package of measures involving, inter\r\nalia, United States agreement to suspend titles III and\r\nIV of the Helms-Burton Act and not to adopt any\r\nfurther extraterritorial legislation of that kind, as well\r\nas agreement on both sides to increase investment\r\nprotection. The European Union trusts that the United\r\nStates Government will continue to act in accordance\r\nwith the commitments made.\r\nThe European Union’s policy towards Cuba is\r\nclear. The Union adopted its common position on Cuba\r\nin December 1996, a position that is still in effect. The\r\nmain objective of the European Union in its relations\r\nwith Cuba is to encourage a process of gradual and\r\npeaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect\r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as\r\nimprovement in the living standards of the Cuban\r\npeople. We wish this process to move forward as fast\r\nas possible.\r\nUnfortunately, the European Union continues to\r\nbe concerned about the political and economic situation\r\nin Cuba. On the political side, the European Union\r\nhopes to see lasting substantial improvements in the\r\nsituation, particularly as regards full respect for human\r\nrights. The European Union emphasizes the\r\nresponsibility of the Cuban authorities regarding\r\nhuman rights such as civil and political rights. In that\r\nconnection, the Union urges them to liberate and fully\r\nintegrate into society all prisoners of conscience. We\r\nappeal to the Cuban authorities to cooperate fully with\r\ninternational human rights bodies and mechanisms.\r\nOn the economic side, the European Union\r\nacknowledges the measures taken by the Cuban\r\nGovernment to improve the country’s economic\r\nintegration into the region. The Union considers that\r\ngradual and irreversible opening up of the Cuban\r\neconomy to the outside world continues to be\r\nnecessary. In this area, the European Union welcomes\r\nfurther cooperation in order to modernize the Cuban\r\neconomy and enable it to become more competitive in\r\nthe international market. Economic growth is essential\r\nto address poverty alleviation in the country. In that\r\nrespect, the negative consequences of the economic,\r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the\r\nUnited States of America on the Cuban population is\r\nworking contrary to our hopes for a democratic and\r\nprosperous Cuba.\r\nFor all those reasons, the European Union\r\nunanimously voted in favour of the resolution that has\r\njust been adopted.\r\nMr. Isakov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): The Russian Federation, like the\r\noverwhelming majority of other States Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, firmly rejects the United States\r\nembargo against Cuba and favours its repeal. Our\r\nposition on this matter has been steady and consistent.\r\nAt previous sessions of the General Assembly, Russia\r\nhas voted in favour of all draft resolutions calling for\r\nan end to the economic, commercial and financial\r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba.\r\nThe Russian Federation believes that the ongoing\r\nembargo against Cuba is not consistent with the times\r\nor with present-day international relations and that it is\r\na relic of the cold war that has no place in the realities\r\nof the twenty-first century. We are also firmly against\r\nany extraterritorial measures, such as the Helms-Burton\r\nAct, which contravenes the basic norms and principles\r\nof international law.\r\nFavouring all realistic steps designed to\r\nnormalize United States-Cuban relations, Russia notes\r\nwith regret that there continues to be a focus on the\r\nmethod of sanctions against the Republic of Cuba.\r\nRussia is convinced that lifting the economic,\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba would\r\nbe a major step towards normalizing relations between\r\nHavana and Washington, D.C., which would be in the\r\ninterest of the peoples of Cuba and of the United States\r\nand would have a beneficial impact on the overall\r\nsituation in the Central American and Caribbean\r\nregion.\r\nSupporting the basic principles of the United\r\nNations Charter and those set forth in the resolution —\r\non the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in\r\ntheir internal affairs and freedom of international trade\r\nand navigation — Russia confirms its intention to\r\ncontinue to develop normal trade and economic\r\nrelations with Cuba. Those relations are based on\r\ncommon interests and mutual benefits and are\r\nconducted in strict accordance with our obligations\r\nunder the Charter and the generally recognized\r\nprinciples and norms of international law, free of\r\ndiscrimination and without detriment to the legitimate\r\nrights and interests of the parties.\r\nGuided by the same fundamental principles of the\r\nCharter, we believe that any discriminatory measures\r\nor interference in the affairs of either party are\r\nunacceptable. In keeping with its position, stated at the\r\nlast session of the General Assembly and at this\r\nsession, Russia voted in favour of the draft resolution\r\ncalling for the embargo to be lifted. We express the\r\nhope that the normalization of Cuba-United States\r\nrelations, for which the international community has\r\nconsistently expressed its support, will become a\r\nreality in the near future.\r\nMr. Moura (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation has the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\ncountries of the Common Market of the Southern Cone\r\n(MERCOSUR) — Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and\r\nBrazil — and the associated countries Bolivia and\r\nChile. As in past years on similar texts, the countries\r\nand associated countries of MERCOSUR voted in\r\nfavour of the resolution just adopted by the Assembly.\r\nThe application of unilateral coercive measures\r\ndoes not contribute to the promotion of a democratic\r\nsystem or to respect for and protection of human rights.\r\nDisputes between States must be resolved through\r\nconstructive dialogue and understanding. Coercive\r\nmeasures, such as sanctions or embargoes, are\r\nexceptions that should be resorted to only when all\r\nother means have been exhausted, and, in any case,\r\nthey should based firmly on international law.\r\nThe extraterritorial application of domestic laws\r\nruns counter to the need to promote dialogue and\r\nguarantee fulfilment of the purposes and principles of\r\nthe Charter, and infringes the sovereignty of States.\r\nSanctions and embargoes that are not in keeping with\r\nthe norms of international law only contribute to\r\nincreasing tension. When they affect the interests of\r\nthird States, as is the case here, the international\r\ncommunity has even greater reasons to be concerned\r\nand to speak out.\r\nAside from having been repeatedly rejected by\r\nthe General Assembly, the economic, commercial and\r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States has\r\nbeen rejected by a series of international forums, such\r\nas the Organization of American States, Rio Group, the\r\nIbero-American Summit and the Latin American\r\nEconomic System. The embargo is also not in keeping\r\nwith the legal obligations of members of the World\r\nTrade Organization. Insisting on maintaining that type\r\nof punitive measures is damaging to all, and it weakens\r\nour fight against the common challenges of our times.\r\nThe countries and associated countries of\r\nMERCOSUR join in the international community’s\r\nnearly unanimous rejection of the promulgation and\r\napplication of that type of unilateral and extraterritorial\r\ncoercive measures. Aside from the legal aspects, such\r\nmeasures do not contribute to Cuba’s full reintegration\r\ninto the inter-American system.\r\nMr. Tesch (Australia): Australia shares concerns\r\nabout the state of human rights and political freedoms\r\nin Cuba, but it does not consider that isolating Cuba\r\nthrough economic sanctions is an effective means of\r\nachieving human rights and political reform. Australia\r\nhas consistently expressed its opposition as a matter of\r\nprinciple to the promulgation and application by States\r\nMembers of the United Nations of laws and measures\r\nthe extraterritorial effects of which affect the\r\nsovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of\r\nentities or persons under their jurisdiction, and freedom\r\nof trade and navigation. In Australia’s view, such laws\r\nand measures are not justified by the principles of\r\ninternational law and comity. Australia is, therefore,\r\nconcerned about the unilateral extraterritorial aspects\r\nof the Helms-Burton Act of 1996. For those reasons,\r\nAustralia has again voted in favour of the draft\r\nresolution submitted under this item.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\r\nexplanation of vote.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.48\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly\r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 26?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, I should like to make an announcement\r\nregarding the programme of work of the plenary\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on Thursday\r\nmorning, 14 November.\r\nAs the first item, the Assembly will continue its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 38, “The situation in\r\nCentral America: procedures for the establishment of a\r\nfirm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a\r\nregion of peace, freedom, democracy and\r\ndevelopment”. As the second item, the Assembly will\r\nresume consideration of agenda item 30, “The role of\r\nthe United Nations in promoting a new global human\r\norder”, in order to take action on draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.10. Finally, as the third item, the Assembly will\r\nconsider agenda item 167, “South American zone of\r\npeace and cooperation”, and will take action on draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.7.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\n"
