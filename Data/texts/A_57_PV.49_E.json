(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Nassir\r\nAbdulaziz Al-Nasser (Qatar), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 42 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special\r\nsession: implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/227,\r\nA/57/227/Corr.1)\r\nMr. Redai (Ethiopia): My delegation wishes to\r\ntake this opportunity to express its profound\r\nappreciation to General Assembly President Kavan for\r\nthe excellent manner in which he has been guiding our\r\ndeliberations, and we are very confident that under his\r\nable stewardship the work of this session will reach a\r\nsuccessful conclusion.\r\nThe Ethiopian delegation is very pleased to share\r\nwith this body its observations on the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on progress towards implementation\r\nof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, an\r\nissue of crucial importance, not only to my country, but\r\nalso to the world community at large.\r\nWe sincerely thank the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive and informative report. We welcome\r\nthe report, and we are in full agreement with many of\r\nhis findings. In particular, we share the view that, while\r\npolitical commitment has contributed to a modest\r\nincrease in resources, country-level activities remain\r\nlimited for managing the epidemic. If HIV/AIDS-\r\nravaged nations are to create a critical mass and mount\r\na sustained effort to curb the disease, the need for\r\ncapacity-building is more critical than ever. For this to\r\nhappen, expertise has to be engaged, experience has to\r\nbe shared and new and additional resources have to be\r\nmobilized.\r\nWe share the consensual view that the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic is not simply a health problem, but rather, a\r\npolitical, economic and social challenge. It is also a\r\nserious security threat. The epidemic is impacting\r\nindividuals, families, nations and the world community\r\nat large.\r\nMy delegation wishes to seize this opportunity to\r\nexpress its appreciation to the crucial role that the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\r\nis playing in the fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nMy delegation also commends the important\r\ncontribution of the Global Fund to Fight Aids,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria and wishes to see\r\ncooperation, coordination and synergy between\r\nUNAIDS and the Global Fund, especially in the area of\r\ncapacity-building.\r\nAIDS continues to be the major preoccupation of\r\ncountries in Africa south of the Sahara, including my\r\ncountry, Ethiopia. The pandemic is negatively\r\nimpacting our population and economy and\r\ncompromising development efforts. The gravity of the\r\nproblem in the continent led to the 2001 Abuja\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nDeclaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other\r\nRelated Infectious Diseases, whose implementation has\r\nbeen accorded maximum attention in subsequent\r\nAfrican forums.\r\nEthiopia is the country with the third largest\r\nnumber of people living with HIV/AIDS. Currently, 1\r\nin every 11 Ethiopians lives with the virus. Thousands\r\nof children are orphaned, and the number of elderly\r\npeople left without providers is on the rise. This is a\r\nsource of great concern in a country like mine, where\r\nthere is no established welfare system.\r\nOn the economic front, HIV/AIDS is\r\nundermining the country’s unceasing efforts to\r\neradicate poverty and to ensure food security and\r\naccess to basic social services, such as clean water,\r\nprimary health care and education. The socio-economic\r\nimpact of HIV/AIDS has not yet been assessed. The\r\nmassive loss of our youth not only limits our socio-\r\neconomic development, but will also eventually lead to\r\na total rupture of the social fabric of society, unless the\r\npandemic is curbed.\r\nFor us in Ethiopia, the issue of reversing the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS is a question of survival. Ethiopia\r\nis fully aware that addressing the scourge expeditiously\r\nand aggressively is crucial; otherwise, the future cost\r\nof development will be extremely high. Certainly, a\r\nquick shift in priorities will be increasingly difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, since resources are limited, health\r\nfacilities are inadequate and the costs of raising public\r\nawareness, as well as education and treatment, are\r\nhigh.\r\nMy Government is taking concrete measures to\r\ncombat this scourge. An HIV/AIDS policy has been\r\nadopted. A National HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control\r\nCouncil, chaired by the President of the country, has\r\nbeen set up, and the same idea has been followed in the\r\nvarious administrative structures. Furthermore, several\r\nministries have formed and designated HIV/AIDS task\r\nforces and focal persons.\r\nA five-year plan is being put in place. Numerous\r\npolicy directives and guidelines to advise HIV/AIDS\r\npatients are being issued. Funds for the anti-HIV/AIDS\r\ncampaign are being allocated. The media, religious\r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations\r\n(NGOs) are playing vital roles in raising public\r\nawareness about the epidemic, as well as in rendering\r\ncounselling services to victims of the disease. Another\r\narea of focus in the fight against the epidemic is to\r\nencourage voluntary testing.\r\nDespite these efforts, a lot remains to be done.\r\nLack of capacity remains one of the major obstacles. In\r\nthis respect, we would like to thank the United States\r\nAgency for International Development (USAID), the\r\nGovernment of Norway, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF), the World Bank and others for the\r\nsupport they have rendered in building the capacity of\r\nthe regional AIDS council secretariats and its\r\nimplementing partners in HIV/AIDS prevention\r\nprogrammes for youth, as well as in mobilizing\r\nresources for the health sector.\r\nHowever, this global crisis calls for further global\r\ninvolvement in the search for a solution. It cannot be\r\ntackled by nations individually. It is the considered\r\nview of my delegation that national HIV/AIDS control\r\nefforts must be complemented with meaningful support\r\nfrom the international community, international\r\nfinancial institutions, civil society, the business\r\ncommunity and the private sector.\r\nBefore closing, my delegation wishes to draw the\r\nattention of the international community to the looming\r\nfamine in our country, which is compounding the\r\nimpact of the scourge. This is imperative, as income is\r\ntoo meagre for basic needs, let alone for access to\r\nantiretroviral medicine.\r\nTherefore, while my delegation is appreciative of\r\nthe immediate relief assistance to the drought victims,\r\nwe are fully convinced that lasting solutions can be\r\nachieved only by tackling the root causes of poverty\r\nthrough the translation of international and national\r\ncommitments from vision to action.\r\nMr. Dube (Botswana): My delegation joins this\r\ndebate with the hope that, in addition to reviewing\r\nprogress that we have made so far, we will take time to\r\nreflect on the obstacles that we have encountered, then\r\nmap out a new strategy for the implementation of the\r\npolitical commitment that we undertook in the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS.\r\nBotswana welcomes the report of the Secretary\r\nGeneral on progress in the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS (A/57/227\r\nand Corr.1). We would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his comprehensive\r\nand concise report.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nWhile we may be pleased with reports of\r\nincreased commitment and determination by world\r\nleaders to be at the forefront in the fight against this\r\npandemic, we are the first to admit that a lot still needs\r\nto be done before we see a meaningful change in our\r\ncollective efforts to control the disease. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has correctly observed in his report that this\r\nepidemic will not be halted without a substantial\r\nstrengthening of the response by the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIn the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS,\r\nwe undertook that by 2003, Member States would\r\nestablish national targets to reduce by 25 per cent HIV\r\nprevalence among young men and women in the 15 to\r\n24 age group in the most affected countries by the year\r\n2005. As we approach the end of the first year since the\r\nspecial session, it is doubtful that those targets will be\r\nfully established and begin to be operational during\r\n2003.\r\nThe statistics from the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) make sombre\r\nreading as we review our targets. They indicate that\r\nonly 20 per cent of the world’s population that is\r\nalready infected or at risk of infection have access to\r\nHIV/AIDS treatment. Those stark figures are a clear\r\nindication of the struggle ahead if the international\r\ncommunity is to make a difference in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nBotswana remains one of the countries most\r\naffected by this disease. Current estimates indicate that\r\n38 per cent of pregnant women, aged between 15 and\r\n49 years, and 27 per cent of men and women in the\r\nsame age group, are infected with the virus. Overall,\r\nwe estimate that 330,000 people out of a population of\r\n1.7 million live with HIV.\r\nHIV/AIDS is the most serious challenge facing\r\nour country today. Indeed, it will become a threat to\r\nour very existence as a nation unless drastic action is\r\ntaken immediately. We have decided as a country to\r\naccord the highest priority to a programme of\r\neducation, prevention, care, support and treatment of\r\npeople suffering from HIV/AIDS.\r\nAs a first step, Botswana has established a\r\nmultisectoral National Aids Council (NAC), chaired by\r\nthe President. Members of the NAC are drawn from all\r\nsectors of society: Members of Parliament, the public\r\nservice, the private sector, non-governmental\r\norganizations, trade unions and religious organizations.\r\nIts mandate is to manage, coordinate and implement a\r\nnational response to HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe NAC has already developed a national\r\nstrategic framework that will guide the planning and\r\nimplementation of programmes for HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention and treatment, care and support\r\nprogrammes and strategies designed to influence\r\nbehaviour change at the national, district and\r\ncommunity levels.\r\nBotswana has now embarked on its third medium-\r\nterm plan, which will focus on prevention, treatment\r\nand intervention programmes. The prevention strategy\r\nnow under implementation covers the following areas.\r\nThe programme on the prevention of mother-to-\r\nchild transmission came into effect in 1999. Today,\r\nBotswana provides full treatment to all pregnant\r\nmothers who have tested positive for HIV and who are\r\nwilling to be treated. The uptake, unfortunately, has\r\nbeen rather slow, due largely to the stigma attached to\r\npeople with HIV/AIDS. Official estimates, however,\r\nindicate that 40 per cent of babies born of HIV-positive\r\nmothers who were treated have been protected from\r\nHIV infection.\r\nThe Government has now embarked on an\r\nintensive education campaign to encourage partners\r\nand relatives of infected women to be more supportive\r\nof them. In this campaign, non-governmental\r\norganizations are also playing a very supportive role.\r\nCondoms, including the female condom, are\r\nbeing provided free. A system of distribution has been\r\nset up, with support from the African Comprehensive\r\nHIV/AIDS Partnerships (ACHAP), through centres or\r\ndispensers in public areas such as shopping malls, in\r\nschools and in offices.\r\nA youth education programme was recently\r\nlaunched in collaboration with the Ministry of\r\nEducation. ACHAP is providing funds to procure\r\ncomputers, videos and other audio-visual materials,\r\nwhich will be distributed to schools. Programmes\r\ntargeting youth will also be broadcast on national\r\ntelevision. In that context, we are pleased to report that\r\nwe have signed an agreement with Brazil for the\r\nprovision of technical assistance in the dissemination\r\nof those youth programmes through radio and\r\ntelevision.\r\nCurrently, the Total Community Mobilization\r\nprogramme has reached 900,000 people in towns and\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nvillages across the country. It is expected that within\r\ntwo years, every town and village will have its own\r\ncommunity-based HIV/AIDS prevention programme.\r\nLastly, the prevention campaign is mounting a\r\npublic education campaign through the media,\r\nbillboards and drama. Those activities have become a\r\nvery popular form of entertainment and learning, but\r\nwith very serious content.\r\nWith regard to treatment, Botswana has now\r\nembarked on full antiretroviral therapy at public\r\nhospitals for all patients who opt for the treatment. The\r\nprogramme is relatively new and, in its first two years,\r\nhas not yet reached the target population of 19,000.\r\nFour centres have now been set up, and they are\r\ncurrently treating more than 2,000 patients, including\r\nchildren. The success rate has been good thus far, with\r\n80 per cent of those who are receiving therapy showing\r\nremarkable improvement. One hundred deaths have\r\nbeen recorded among those on full antiretroviral\r\ntreatment.\r\nThe Government is running a successful\r\ncommunity home-based care programme in close\r\ncollaboration with certain non-governmental\r\norganizations. That programme is very effective, as it\r\nenables the sick — who otherwise would have been\r\ncrowded into hospitals — to be cared for by their\r\nfamilies at home.\r\nAs part of the national effort to determine the\r\ntotal number of people affected by the disease,\r\nBotswana has set up 14 voluntary testing centres\r\naround the country. They are being run and financed in\r\ncollaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and\r\nPrevention of the United States. The results from the\r\ntesting centres also help us determine the kind of\r\ntreatment that should be recommended for each patient.\r\nIn collaboration with the Harvard AIDS Institute,\r\nBotswana has built a laboratory — which we believe is\r\nthe first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa — to develop\r\na vaccine for the sub-type C virus, which is peculiar to\r\nour part of the world. Vaccine trials are due to\r\ncommence later this year.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating\r\nimpact on our children. For the first time in our history,\r\nBotswana must deal with a growing population of\r\norphaned children and children of parents who are so\r\nweakened by the disease as to be unable to look after\r\nthem. To meet those challenges, we have now set up an\r\norphan care programme. A number of orphans are\r\nlooked after by relatives. For those children,\r\nGovernment provides free food, clothing, medical\r\ntreatment and education. A small number of\r\norphanages are being operated by non-governmental\r\norganizations and by churches. The Government is now\r\nsupporting them with subsidies to meet some of their\r\noperational costs, which are rising as more children are\r\nbrought in. Plans are now in an advanced stage to build\r\na Children’s Centre of Excellence, which will treat all\r\ndiseases affecting children, especially those associated\r\nwith HIV/AIDS. The Centre is being set up in\r\ncollaboration with the Baylor College of Medicine in\r\nthe United States.\r\nThe task that we have set for ourselves is\r\nenormous and expensive. We have been fortunate to\r\nhave established partnerships with other organizations\r\nand with pharmaceutical companies to help us tackle\r\nthe pandemic. They include the Harvard AIDS\r\nInstitute, the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation, Pfizer,\r\nMerck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and, of course, ACHAP.\r\nThe magnitude of the effects of HIV/AIDS on the\r\nsocio-economic development of Botswana has been\r\ndevastating. The leadership and the people of\r\nBotswana, however, are determined to fight the\r\npandemic using every means at their disposal. Our\r\ngratitude goes to the friendly Governments and donor-\r\npartners who have shared their resources and\r\nknowledge with Botswana.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reiterate the view\r\nalready expressed by many speakers that the threat\r\nposed by HIV/AIDS to the lives of our people and to\r\nour socio-economic development — especially in\r\ndeveloping countries — is real and will be costly. Let\r\nus therefore recommit ourselves to the objectives of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment of the special session if we\r\nare to secure the future of the generations to come.\r\nMr. Laurin (Canada): Canada would like to\r\nthank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his stalwart\r\nleadership in focusing world attention on the global\r\nHIV/AIDS crisis. We also congratulate Dr. Peter Piot\r\nand his team on the leadership that the Joint United\r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has\r\ndemonstrated in coordinating the work of United\r\nNations institutions and specialized agencies on\r\nHIV/AIDS and in supporting national commitments,\r\nboth in the context of the Declaration of Commitment\r\nof the General Assembly special session and elsewhere.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nThe Secretary-General’s comprehensive report on\r\nprogress towards implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (A/57/227 and Corr.1) does\r\nnot make for easy reading. Like the historic special\r\nsession during which we adopted the Declaration of\r\nCommitment, the report highlights the fact that, in only\r\n20 years, the HIV/AIDS pandemic has caused untold\r\nsuffering and death worldwide, destroying entire\r\ncommunities, undoing development gains and posing a\r\nserious threat to whole continents, as is currently the\r\ncase in Africa. The situation is growing worse in a\r\nnumber of ways.\r\nBut the report also serves to remind the world\r\nthat there is hope. As Dr. Piot told us during his\r\npresentation two weeks ago, we already know what\r\nworks. This epidemic can be turned around, and the\r\ntools that we need in order to do so are outlined in the\r\nDeclaration. As the Secretary-General’s report makes\r\nclear, a comprehensive attack must entail many\r\nelements. It must include strategies to protect\r\nespecially vulnerable groups. Canada’s domestic efforts\r\nhave focused on men who have sex with men, on\r\ninjection-drug users, on sex workers and on prisoners,\r\namong other groups. A comprehensive approach also\r\nincludes prevention, care, treatment and support as\r\nintegral elements of the same continuum. We are\r\npleased to see that the report recognizes that effective\r\nHIV/AIDS strategies must be committed to respect for\r\nhuman rights, particularly those of women, men and\r\nchildren with HIV/AIDS, of their families and of\r\ncaregivers. As the process leading to and beyond the\r\nspecial session has demonstrated, and as we all agreed\r\nin the Declaration of Commitment, the challenge of\r\ndefeating this epidemic cannot be met without the full\r\nengagement of a wide number of disciplines and\r\nsectors, including civil society, non-governmental\r\norganizations and the private sector. We must bring\r\nrenewed vigour to the fight to build greater political\r\ncommitment behind a comprehensive attack on a\r\nscourge that is destroying communities and\r\ndestabilizing entire regions.\r\nSpoke in French\r\nCanada takes its commitment to following up on\r\nthe special session seriously. Last June we sent to the\r\nUnited Nations our first annual report on the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment,\r\nwhich was developed in consultation with stakeholders\r\nin Government and civil society. We intend to submit a\r\nsecond annual report next year, using a similar\r\ninclusive process to develop it. Canada’s international\r\ndevelopment assistance, provided through the\r\nprogrammes of the Canadian International\r\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), will continue to work\r\ntoward the achievement of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals and to meeting the commitments\r\nspelled out in the Declaration of Commitment.\r\nFor its part, CIDA will continue to focus on four\r\nsocial development priorities, namely basic education,\r\nchild protection, health and nutrition, as well as\r\nHIV/AIDS, while at the same time strengthening our\r\ninvestments in rural development, including\r\nagriculture, water and the environment.\r\nCanada is increasing its efforts against HIV/AIDS\r\nand will continue to work with developing countries\r\nand countries in transition to meet the goals and\r\ncommitments of the Declaration. We strongly support\r\nthe formation of partnerships between Governments\r\nand civil society to improve prevention efforts to\r\nstrengthen care, treatment and support, and to promote\r\nand protect the rights of those infected by HIV/AIDS.\r\nThis includes more diligent efforts to reach those most\r\nvulnerable, including women, youth and children,\r\ninjection drug users, prisoners, displaced persons and\r\npersons affected by conflict, men who have sexual\r\nrelations with men, and commercial sex workers. \r\nWe understand that some delegations have asked\r\nfor more information regarding particular strategies\r\nrecommended by the Joint United Nations Programme\r\non HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in fighting HIV/AIDS among\r\nthe most vulnerable groups. We encourage these\r\ndelegations to engage with an open mind in dialogue\r\nwith UNAIDS on the development and implementation\r\nof appropriate strategies to fight this epidemic. CIDA\r\nhas committed to quadrupling its investment in the\r\nfight against HIV/AIDS, which will attain 80 million\r\nCanadian dollars by the year 2005. Canada also\r\nrecently increased its annual funding to UNAIDS by\r\n5 million Canadian dollars. As president of the G8 this\r\nyear, Canada is pleased to have been able to focus the\r\nattention of this group on the issue of HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe G8 Africa Action Plan clearly identifies\r\nimproving health and confronting HIV/AIDS as a key\r\nobjective and includes specific commitments to tackle\r\nthis challenge. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, first discussed at the Genoa\r\nG8 Summit and finalized shortly after the Kananaskis\r\nSummit, emerged as a result of the growing consensus\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\namong world leaders regarding the magnitude of the\r\nthreats posed by this health epidemic in the developing\r\nworld. Canada is pleased to have played a key role in\r\nthe Fund’s foundation and has pledged $100 million\r\nover four years to the Fund. Additionally, at the\r\nKananaskis Summit, Canada committed 50 million\r\nCanadian dollars to crucial research towards the\r\ndevelopment of an HIV vaccine.\r\nWe look forward to the ongoing review of the\r\nimplementation of the Declaration of Commitment in\r\nthe fall of 2003. As the Declaration calls for an\r\ninteractive discussion on the Secretary-General’s report\r\nin 2003, a thorough review of further progress in\r\nimplementation will be critical, especially since 2003\r\nis the year when the first set of targets comes due and it\r\nwill be the first year when the indicators developed by\r\nUNAIDS will be monitored. Canada looks forward to\r\nengaging in this discussion as part of the General\r\nAssembly session, with the appropriate involvement of\r\ncivil society.\r\nMuch remains to be done in following up the\r\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS. The report has described\r\nonce again the scope of the challenges we all face. We\r\npledge our cooperation with all concerned in seeking to\r\nmeet them.\r\nMr. Alabi (Nigeria): My delegation would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his useful report\r\ncontained in document A/57/227, on agenda item 42,\r\nconcerning “progress towards the implementation of\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS”. We\r\nalso wish to state that the adoption of the Declaration\r\nby the General Assembly in June 2001 is a\r\nconfirmation of urgent global concern for the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic, whose prevalence rate and spread\r\nhas become increasingly alarming. Wherever it exists,\r\nparticularly in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS\r\npresents a huge and complex humanitarian crisis, with\r\nlarge-scale destabilizing effects on the economy, social\r\ncohesion, political stability and development.\r\nMy delegation wishes to observe that the\r\nHIV/AIDS scourge continues to defy all actions taken\r\nat both national and international levels to reverse its\r\nspread. Available statistical data by UNAIDS are quite\r\nstaggering and dismal. For instance, they indicate that\r\nthose currently living with the disease total 40 million,\r\nwith a total of 3 million deaths in 2001, while the total\r\nnumber of children orphaned by AIDS and living at the\r\nend of the same year was put at 14 million. Similarly,\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\r\nin its 2001 Situation Assessment and Analysis, on\r\nChildren’s and Women’s Rights in Nigeria, states that,\r\nas of 1999, 2.6 million Nigerians, aged 15 to 49, were\r\ninfected. It further records that over the same period,\r\nthe country had the fourth largest number of those\r\ninfected in the developing world, after South Africa,\r\nIndia and Ethiopia. The epidemic is on the increase in\r\nNigeria, though at a slower rate when compared to\r\nother countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General, the point is made that\r\nthe rates of infection among young people also\r\ncontinued to rise in Eastern Europe and Asia.\r\nTherefore, this confirms the Declaration’s recognition\r\nof the epidemic as the single greatest threat to the well-\r\nbeing of future generations and would remain so unless\r\ncountries give utmost priority attention to its\r\nimplementation.\r\nPermit me to state that Nigeria attaches great\r\nimportance to the implementation of the Declaration.\r\nThis is manifested in the measures put in place to\r\naccomplish time-bound targets on AIDS programmes\r\nin the country. Also, the Government, in order to\r\nachieve progress in efforts to combat the spread of the\r\npandemic, established effective cooperation with\r\nfriendly countries and the United Nations system,\r\nparticularly UNAIDS, UNDP, the World Health\r\nOrganization and the United Nations International\r\nChildren’s Fund, as well as with civil society, relevant\r\nnon-governmental organizations and other\r\nstakeholders.\r\nIn recognition of its significant leadership role in\r\nthe fight against HIV/AIDS, the Government has\r\nevolved coherent policies and initiatives to enhance\r\nefforts for the prevention of the spread of the disease,\r\nwhile at the same time averting new infections. The\r\ngenuine commitment of the Government is\r\ndemonstrated in the setting up of the National Action\r\nCommittee on AIDS, headed by President Olusegun\r\nObasanjo.\r\nThe Committee is charged with the responsibility\r\nof coordinating the national response and strategy of\r\nimplementation of the Declaration. The Government\r\nhas also put in place multisectoral strategies which\r\ninclude education and training of personnel, as well as\r\nthe involvement of the media and communication\r\nexperts in information dissemination in schools and\r\nworkplaces. This approach has been quite useful in\r\nchanging the attitude of denial of those who are\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nafflicted and has helped to make successful the\r\nUNAIDS-led campaign against the stigmatization and\r\ndiscrimination often suffered by people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nFurthermore, since those afflicted fear exclusion\r\nor attack, the Government has formulated appropriate\r\npolicies and legislation to eliminate discrimination and\r\nto protect the basic rights of the afflicted to education,\r\nhealth care and job opportunities at all levels in the\r\ncountry.\r\nBased on Nigeria’s understanding of the nature of\r\nthe disease as an economic as well as a health problem,\r\nthe Nigerian Government continues to intensify efforts\r\ntowards its effective management and control. For\r\nexample, the National AIDS/STD Control Programme\r\nof the Ministry of Health conducts surveys, does\r\nresearch and produces data which make it possible to\r\nobtain a fairly clear picture of the nature, scope and\r\nspread of the epidemic. Also, to demonstrate its strong\r\nresolve to implement the Declaration, the Government\r\napproved voluntary free AIDS tests and professional\r\ncounselling for all concerned.\r\nSimilarly, the National Action Committee on\r\nAIDS continues to encourage the active involvement of\r\nlocal communities, non-governmental organizations\r\nand other stakeholders in the promotion of all anti-\r\nHIV/AIDS activities. The national association for\r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS, through its active\r\nparticipation in conferences, seminars and workshops,\r\ncontinues to prove quite resourceful in the context of\r\nthe overall national response to combat the continued\r\nspread of the disease. Indeed, it must be stated that\r\nNigeria is committed to taking a holistic approach to\r\ntackling the pandemic, including the provision of\r\nantiretroviral drugs to all HIV/AIDS sufferers and the\r\nuse of appropriate educational strategies to enhance\r\nknowledge about its nature and prevention.\r\nConsequently, it is our strong belief that for anti-\r\nHIV/AIDS efforts to be successful, they must transcend\r\nthe national boundaries of all Member States. They\r\nmust also involve concerted action on the part of\r\nGovernments, intergovernmental agencies, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, civil society, the United\r\nNations system and the entire international community.\r\nThis will require aggressive political will in order to\r\nstrengthen commitments and to forge the partnerships\r\nnecessary to build capacity and to enhance effective\r\ninterventions through comprehensive programmes for\r\nprevention, care and treatment worldwide, particularly\r\nin Asia and Africa, which are the worst hit by the\r\nepidemic.\r\nMy delegation is therefore of the view that,\r\nunless existing obstacles are overcome, efforts to\r\ncombat the scourge of HIV/AIDS in developing\r\ncountries will remain elusive. Already there are\r\nprevailing sociocultural and attitudinal problems to\r\novercome in most of sub-Saharan Africa, where both\r\northodox and traditional medical practitioners engage\r\nin unsafe practices. Clinics, hospitals and laboratories\r\nuse unsterilized instruments for skin piercing and\r\nbloodletting. Tattooing, incisions, the draining of\r\nwounds and genital mutilations are among the\r\nprocedures that are carried out without regard for\r\nequipment sterilization or safety procedures.\r\nIn addition, the problem of denial by those living\r\nwith the disease still persists. The situation is\r\ncompounded by inadequate technical assistance and\r\nresources for the training of personnel and the care of\r\nchildren orphaned or made vulnerable by the epidemic.\r\nIt is most unfortunate that Africa is severely\r\nconstrained by a dearth of resources in its efforts to\r\nintensify the fight against the scourge. Part of the\r\nreason is that the level of official development\r\nassistance to developing countries is not only\r\nabysmally low but also discriminatory. This situation\r\ncreates doubt as to whether Africa would receive\r\npriority consideration in the allocation of the resources\r\nof the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and\r\nMalaria to strengthen preventive measures and to\r\nmount an aggressive response to stem the spread of the\r\ndisease.\r\nTo make matters worse, many of the world’s\r\nleading pharmaceutical companies are more concerned\r\nwith the protection of intellectual property and patent\r\nrights, while Africans are threatened with decimation\r\nby the lethal nexus of HIV/AIDS and other\r\nopportunistic diseases. Added to this is the crippling\r\ndebt burden, which continues to deprive African\r\ncountries of the resources needed to ameliorate the\r\nplight of those living with the pandemic.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to reiterate my\r\ncountry’s persistent call for the forgiveness of the\r\nexternal debts of African countries, the servicing of\r\nwhich continues to consume the scarce financial\r\nresources required for the funding of the basic socio-\r\neconomic development needs and the infrastructure of\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\naffected countries. Furthermore, in view of the\r\napparent correlation between the extent of poverty and\r\nthe spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in any given\r\nsociety, we cannot overemphasize the imperative of\r\nincreased official development assistance and funding\r\nfrom the Global Fund, in support of the developing and\r\nleast developed countries, in the procurement and the\r\ndistribution of antiretroviral drugs to HIV/AIDS\r\nvictims.\r\nIn conclusion, while Nigeria strongly believes in\r\nthe United Nations as the only body that can provide\r\nmeaningful global leadership in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS in a coordinated and coherent manner and\r\nwithout discrimination, it notes with regret that the\r\nimpact of the comprehensive international effort to\r\nprovide HIV/AIDS-centred assistance has hardly been\r\nfelt in many parts of Africa. The slow and relative\r\nprogress recorded so far in some African States can be\r\ntraced largely to the personal and collective\r\ncommitments of the continent’s leaders. It is on this\r\nscore that Nigeria appreciates the recommendation of\r\nthe Secretary-General calling on the international\r\ncommunity, especially the donor countries,\r\nsignificantly to increase their contributions to anti-\r\nHIV/AIDS efforts.\r\nTo this end, we consider it essential that a\r\ncomprehensive review of the global assistance to and\r\nthe strategy for Africa be carried out. Support should\r\nbe given to genuine partnership that will coordinate\r\nexisting efforts at the national and regional levels, with\r\na view to complementing the laudable role of the\r\nUnited Nations system and other international\r\napproaches aimed at achieving the objectives of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS in African\r\ncountries. Nigeria welcomes meaningful cooperation\r\nwith like-minded countries in this regard.\r\nMr. Belinga-Eboutou (Cameroon) (spoke in\r\nFrench): In a few moments, the General Assembly will\r\nhave concluded its deliberations on the follow-up to the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. The\r\ndelegation of Cameroon, which has listened in silence\r\nto the statements made so far, is participating in this\r\ndiscussion with the depth of emotion and sense of\r\ngravity that the topic deserves. How could we not feel\r\nemotion, given the litany of disturbing figures and facts\r\ncited throughout this debate? Those facts and figures\r\ngive a clear picture of the ravages of HIV/AIDS. They\r\nshow the death that it sows in its wake and the degree\r\nwhich the disease has progressed. Despite everything\r\nwe do, its progress seems inexorable.\r\nMy delegation is thus participating in this debate\r\nwith great seriousness. What is at stake, in the final\r\nanalysis, is the future of humanity — the future of our\r\nsocieties, the future of humankind. In short, what is\r\nthreatened is the future of all of us.\r\nThe segments of the population that have been\r\nmost affected by AIDS are precisely those that\r\nrepresent the future: children and adolescents, girls and\r\nwomen. The world of tomorrow will therefore depend\r\non what we do today to combat AIDS. Now is the time\r\nto act. We must act quickly and immediately; tomorrow\r\nit will be too late.\r\nIn this regard, we support the recommendations\r\ncontained in the Secretary-General’s report (A/57/227).\r\nAmong those recommendations, the delegation of\r\nCameroon would like to single out five urgent\r\nmeasures that need to be taken. The delegation of\r\nCameroon believes that they are urgent because they\r\nwill be decisive for humankind.\r\nFirst, we must understand the implications of the\r\nfact that AIDS is no longer a health problem, but a\r\ndevelopment problem. The fight against AIDS must\r\ntherefore be included in all of our programmes and\r\npolicies, alongside the campaigns against illiteracy,\r\nhunger and malnutrition. In order to build a world that\r\nis free from the haunting threat of AIDS, we must now\r\nbegin to build a world free from poverty.\r\n To that end, we must increase financial resources\r\nto fight AIDS — that is the second urgent measure that\r\nmust be undertaken. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is clear in this regard. The international\r\ncommunity is not allocating sufficient resources to\r\nprogrammes to combat AIDS. Our response must be\r\ncommensurate with the spread of the pandemic, which\r\nis developing three times more quickly than the\r\nresources to combat it. Official development\r\nassistance, which is continuing to decline, must be\r\nincreased. That is the chief responsibility of those that\r\nhave more resources.\r\nThirdly, we must ensure the active participation\r\nof civil society, in particular the non-governmental\r\norganizations. The fourth urgent measure is\r\nstrengthening cooperation between international\r\norganizations, in particular with regard to prevention,\r\nthe dissemination of information, education and\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nassistance. The fifth urgent measure is to intensify and\r\ncoordinate efforts among partners — international\r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and\r\nGovernments.\r\nThose are the urgent measures that Africa — the\r\narea worst affected by AIDS — expects the\r\ninternational community to take in support of its own\r\nefforts.\r\nIt should be recalled that, in this respect, Africa\r\nhas acquired the necessary tools and framework for a\r\nfruitful partnership. That was the purpose of the Dakar\r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action. It was the\r\nobjective sought by African countries in establishing\r\nthe African funds to combat AIDS. It was the purpose\r\nof the cooperative framework set up by the\r\nOrganization of African Unity, the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS, the World Health\r\nOrganization and the United Nations Children’s Fund.\r\nAnd finally, it was the object of the Abuja Declaration\r\nand Programme of Action on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis\r\nand Other Related Infectious Diseases in Africa.\r\nOn the basis of that continent-wide dynamic,\r\nCameroon launched, in 2000, a strategic plan to combat\r\nAIDS. Its implementation will require significant\r\nresources: about 137 thousand million CFA francs —\r\nabout $197 million. We expect one fifth of the funding\r\nto be provided by the multi-country programmes to\r\ncombat AIDS established by the World Bank.\r\nWe therefore reiterate our appeal for greater\r\nsupport from the international community in our efforts\r\nto combat AIDS. Cameroon’s strategic plan sets out a\r\nframework for a true solidarity pact.\r\nWe welcome the commitment of civil society,\r\nworking side by side with the public sector in the\r\ncampaign against AIDS. There are currently about 100\r\nnon-governmental organizations that work with persons\r\nwith AIDS, whether young people, women or children.\r\nIn two days’ time, that commitment will be\r\ndemonstrated with the convening, at Yaoundé, of an\r\ninternational meeting at the civil society level devoted\r\nto AIDS. As I said in this Hall on 20 September 2002,\r\nthe first ladies of Africa will meet in Cameroon on 15\r\nand 16 November 2002 to launch, with the help of\r\nrenowned scientists and other eminent men and women\r\nof goodwill, a non-governmental organization called\r\n“African Synergies against AIDS and Other\r\nAfflictions”.\r\nThe dual premise of the first ladies’ approach will\r\nbe, first, that having more money is not enough, the\r\nmoney must have the greatest possible impact; and,\r\nsecondly, that in Africa and in the rest of the world that\r\nis working for Africa, there are many praiseworthy\r\ninitiatives aimed at combating AIDS, but these\r\ninitiatives are, unfortunately, such isolated and not\r\nlinked together in a consistent or cohesive way. We\r\nmust therefore bring such initiatives together. Whether\r\nthey are local, national, regional or even global, they\r\nmust be federated, so to speak, so that we can take\r\nmaximum advantage of their synergy and results.\r\nThat is the message that will be sent from\r\nYaoundé the day after tomorrow. It is a message aimed\r\nat African and global synergy in order to ensure that\r\nvictory is certain in the fight against AIDS. Because\r\nwhat will determine the number of lives that we save is\r\nnot the colossal amount of money spent, but the way in\r\nwhich such funds are spent — the effectiveness with\r\nwhich we target them.\r\nAIDS is one of the most devastating threats that\r\nAfrica has ever experienced. Specialists tell us that\r\nAIDS kills more people than malaria. Because of\r\nAIDS, the funeral industry unfortunately seems to be\r\nthe most prosperous business in Africa today. It is for\r\nthat reason that the fight against this scourge has been\r\ncalled a sacred crusade. The United Nations was\r\nestablished to save succeeding generations from the\r\nscourge of war. We must therefore organize ourselves\r\ntoday to wage and win a peaceful and sacred war\r\nagainst AIDS.\r\nThe words of an African poet came to my mind as\r\nI was preparing this statement. With the permission of\r\nthe Assembly, I should like to read out the words of\r\nMongane Wally Serote.\r\n“Remember the suffering of our hearts, the\r\npainful and lacerating pain we felt in listening to\r\nthe convulsive sobs of our young children crying\r\nat their destiny. We listened to them and made\r\nthem our own; we absorbed them. But we moved\r\nahead, knowing that life is a promise and that that\r\npromise is us”.\r\nThat promise is indeed us. We who are the\r\nrepresentatives of the peoples of the United Nations\r\nmust become a promise of hope and change. AIDS\r\nkills, it is true. We must become the promise of life.\r\nWe have the means to do so. We have the resources\r\nnecessary to make a difference. Let us therefore keep\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nthe promise of winning the battle against this disease,\r\nso that future generations looking into the history of\r\nAIDS will see a human tragedy, but also, and in\r\nparticular, the tale of a time when humankind acted in\r\nsolidarity and was victorious. Now is the time to act,\r\nand to act quickly. We owe it to all those who have\r\ndied of this disease. We owe it to all who have suffered\r\nand to all who continue to suffer from it. Tomorrow\r\nwill be too late.\r\nMr. Lamba (Malawi): Today, HIV/AIDS is\r\nprobably the worst human epidemic in history. It is\r\ncertainly the worst human epidemic of the twentieth\r\nand twenty-first centuries. The Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS in\r\nresolution S-26/2, represents an important milestone in\r\nthe global response to the pandemic. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/57/227) highlights the\r\nachievements and potential challenges in the\r\nimplementation of the commitments. My delegation\r\nfully endorses the critical recommendations in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report.\r\nThe Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and its eight partners deserve to\r\nbe commended for their untiring efforts to assist\r\nMember States to translate the Declaration of\r\nCommitment into concrete action. It is very\r\ndisappointing that, despite the efforts by the\r\ninternational community to eliminate the vulnerability\r\nof the human race to HIV/AIDS, the epidemic\r\ncontinues to pose serious threats to humankind. Indeed,\r\na lot of work remains to be done if we are to realize the\r\ngoals of the Declaration of Commitment.\r\nHIV/AIDS remains a very serious problem in\r\nMalawi, as indeed in it is in the whole of Africa.\r\nEstimates made by Malawi’s national AIDS\r\ncommission in 2001 put the prevalence of HIV among\r\nthose aged 15 to 49 at 15 per cent, out of an entire\r\npopulation of about 12 million. The prevalence of\r\nHIV/AIDS in other States of the Southern Africa\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) subregion is no\r\nbetter. Statistics in Malawi show that 25 to 50 per cent\r\nof the workforce is likely to be lost to the epidemic by\r\n2005. The majority of young people in the 15 to 24 age\r\nbracket are the most highly infected, with as many as\r\nsix HIV-positive girls for every one HIV-positive boy.\r\nAIDS is wreaking havoc on our communities, where\r\nthe national productive capacity has been profoundly\r\naffected, particularly in Malawi. Malawi’s national\r\nresponse to the epidemic has touched on a number of\r\nkey areas, including those raised in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General — for example, in the areas of\r\nleadership, partnership and resources.\r\nMy delegation fully endorses the observation\r\nmade by the Secretary-General that strong political\r\nleadership must be a central feature if countries are to\r\nsucceed in their responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\r\nThe leadership in Malawi has been, and continues to\r\nbe, forthcoming and actively involved in mobilizing\r\nthe nation to combat this scourge. For instance, in 1994\r\nthe President of the nation led the country in an\r\nawareness-raising march in an effort to break the\r\nsilence and show that HIV/AIDS had become a very\r\nserious problem in the country. Consequently, political,\r\nreligious and civil society leaders have taken every\r\nopportunity to talk openly about AIDS, its dangers and\r\nits consequences. However, the major challenge\r\nremains actually changing people’s behaviour and\r\nattitudes.\r\nThe mechanism for Malawi’s national response is\r\nthe Strategic Framework on HIV/AIDS 2000-2004,\r\nwhich was launched in 1999 with the sponsorship of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\r\nAmong other things, the programme focuses on young\r\npeople, with particular emphasis on behavioural\r\nchange. The National AIDS Commission and the\r\nMinistry for Health and Population are the major\r\nimplementing agencies. In addition, a cabinet-level\r\ncommittee on HIV/AIDS has been established in\r\nMalawi to ensure, among other things, that HIV/AIDS\r\nremains high on the national agenda. The committee\r\nmaintains close oversight over the implementation of\r\nprogrammes across the country, and reports directly to\r\nthe President.\r\nIn a recent development, and to emphasize his\r\npersonal commitment, the President of the Republic of\r\nMalawi, Mr. Muluzi, directed the Malawi National\r\nAIDS Commission to report to his office in order to\r\nensure close monitoring of progress in the fight against\r\nthe epidemic. However, some traditional cultural\r\nbeliefs and customs that encourage and promote the\r\nspread of the disease continue to be of great concern.\r\nThose practices present a major impediment to the\r\nnational campaign against the pandemic.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report observes that the\r\nengagement of other sectors in the active response to\r\nthe pandemic poses a major challenge. This is true in\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nthe whole SADC region, as the statement to be made\r\non behalf of the subregion will indicate. All possible\r\nefforts are being made to treat HIV/AIDS as a cross-\r\ncutting issue whose elimination requires the\r\ninvolvement of all other sectors. In Malawi,\r\nGovernment-approved budget lines for each ministry\r\nand department to implement HIV/AIDS programmes\r\nare a must. The education sector is one area where\r\nsome progress has been registered. School curriculums\r\nat both the primary and secondary levels have been\r\nrevised to include sex education and messages about\r\nthe dangers of HIV/AIDS and how to prevent them.\r\nPartnership with the private sector, civil society\r\nand the donor community has yielded positive results\r\nin the fight against HIV/AIDS. In its efforts to curb the\r\nepidemic, the Malawi National AIDS Control\r\nProgramme has facilitated the establishment of\r\ninstitutional structures such as the Media and AIDS\r\nSociety, AIDS clubs, the Malawi AIDS Network — an\r\norganization that supports HIV/AIDS groups — the\r\nDistrict AIDS Coordination Committee and village\r\nAIDS coordination committees. These initiatives have\r\nso far facilitated the dissemination of messages about\r\nthe dangers of the epidemic in rural areas and urban\r\ncentres alike.\r\nOther initiatives in Malawi include, for example,\r\nthe Drama on AIDS Programme, peer education for\r\nyoung people, sex workers and truck drivers, the\r\nintroduction of a red ribbon campaign, billboard\r\nmessages that include the President’s portrait and open\r\ndialogue with religious leaders on HIV/AIDS issues.\r\nTo widen outreach to rural areas, adult literacy\r\nbooklets with HIV/AIDS messages have been\r\npublished as post-literacy materials. Furthermore, rural\r\nresource centres where people can access information\r\non HIV/AIDS have also been established.\r\nThese initiatives are aimed at sustaining wider\r\nlevels of HIV/AIDS awareness. However, as pointed\r\nout by the Executive Director of UNAIDS, the\r\ngeographical and numerical coverage of interventions\r\nremains the key to the success of these initiatives, most\r\nof which operate as small-scale interventions rather\r\nthan as nationwide comprehensive programmes due to\r\nfinancial constraints, among other limitations.\r\nThe problem of orphans is also on the rise in\r\nMalawi. Malawi alone has close to 1 million orphans.\r\nIt is estimated that in the next 10 years 70,000 children\r\nin Malawi will become orphans annually, their parents\r\nhaving perished. At this point, let me commend the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, other United Nations\r\nagencies, the United States Agency for International\r\nDevelopment, and non-governmental organizations\r\nsuch as Save the Children for their increased support to\r\norphan care programmes in Malawi.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for this report, which calls on all Member\r\nStates to strengthen their intervention efforts through,\r\namong other measures, enhanced access to HIV/AIDS\r\ntreatments such as antiretroviral drugs, which need to\r\nbe made available to all. HIV/AIDS patients must get\r\nthose drugs at affordable cost. This is an area in which\r\nthe Government of Malawi is facing serious\r\ndifficulties, for economic reasons.\r\nThe Government of Malawi is profoundly\r\ngrateful for the injection of financial resources\r\namounting to $190 million for the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria over the next five\r\nyears for the purpose of implementing the Declaration\r\nof Commitment. I would like to thank all donors who\r\nhave generously contributed to the Fund. I would also\r\nlike to take this opportunity to urge them to continue to\r\nsupport the Fund so that the work in this area is\r\nsustained in a manner commensurate with the speed at\r\nwhich the epidemic is spreading.\r\nIn conclusion, the Government of Malawi would\r\nlike to call for continued international technical and\r\nfinancial support for all the efforts designed to address\r\nthe HIV epidemic and its related problems.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Several\r\nyears ago, Luc Montaigner, the scientist who\r\ndiscovered the agent that causes AIDS, said that no\r\ndisease in modern times had raised so many questions\r\nabout our identity, values and sense of tolerance and\r\nresponsibility. This disease indeed raises questions in\r\nevery one of our countries and societies. Those\r\nquestions relate to how we should organize ourselves to\r\nreflect our values, the tolerance we must demonstrate\r\nand our responsibility to confront the challenge.\r\nIn that regard, we appreciate the tremendous step\r\ntaken by the international community in the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, which\r\nMember States adopted in June 2001 in resolution\r\nS-26/2. We consider the points made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report (A/57/227) on progress towards\r\nthe implementation of the Declaration to be very\r\nimportant and very useful.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nWe agree that the Declaration marks a milestone\r\nin the fight against the pandemic, as it establishes for\r\nthe first time concrete objectives and specific\r\ntimetables for all States. We are being called upon to\r\nexpand global efforts, including measures at\r\nprevention, access, support, treatment and the\r\nprotection of human rights — especially those of the\r\nmost vulnerable groups — as well as to mitigate the\r\neffects of HIV/AIDS on society and to allocate\r\nsufficient resources to carry out these activities. We\r\nmust also acknowledge the work done by the United\r\nNations by expanding cooperation and technical\r\nassistance programmes, especially through the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).\r\nWith regard to the allocation of resources, the\r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria\r\nhas begun to play a very important role as a financing\r\nmechanism. That has meant significant progress in the\r\nstruggle to reduce the enormous economic shortfall in\r\nresponding to this epidemic. We believe that the Fund\r\nis an expression of solidarity and of understanding of\r\nthe difficulties that many countries have in\r\nimplementing appropriate policies. Nevertheless, we\r\nknow that the resources committed to date represent\r\nonly a third of what is needed, and that greater\r\ncooperation by the international community will be\r\nnecessary. This situation is particularly serious as it\r\nrelates to the African continent, which is the region\r\nmost affected by AIDS and which requires a special\r\neffort from donor countries.\r\nAfter reviewing the preliminary results referred to\r\nby the Secretary-General in his report, we believe we\r\nmust recognize the progress achieved and the efforts\r\nmade by countries to develop and implement national\r\nstrategies, particularly by low- and middle-income\r\ncountries, which face even greater challenges.\r\nIn that connection, I wish to point out that Chile\r\nis working resolutely to implement the commitments\r\nwe have undertaken and to confront the challenges\r\nposed by HIV/AIDS, particularly with regard to the\r\nimplementation of our national strategy. We believe\r\nthat our experience could be of interest to other\r\ncountries committed to the same struggle.\r\nOver the last decade, the epidemic in Chile has\r\nbeen tackled through an intersectoral approach,\r\nincluding a standing committee composed of under-\r\nsecretaries for health, the interior, the cabinet,\r\neducation, justice, planning, labour and the police. In\r\naddition, we have also established the National AIDS\r\nCommission, which is the agency responsible for the\r\ndevelopment and executive coordination of the\r\nprogramme for the control and prevention of AIDS.\r\nOne of the main tasks of the Commission has been to\r\ncarry out studies and assessments that have served as a\r\nbasis for the drafting of working policies and strategies\r\nin the areas of prevention and care with the active\r\nparticipation of other State institutions and civil\r\nsociety, particularly with organizations of persons\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS and those at greater risk of the\r\nepidemic, as well as church and humanitarian\r\norganizations in general.\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThat response is a clear sign of my country’s\r\nbelief that economic, political, legal and sociocultural\r\nfactors determine vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. It is also\r\nan indication of our resolve to develop, with the\r\nparticipation of all actors involved, policies that\r\npromote human development and solidarity and\r\nrecognize diversity as a cultural asset of society. We\r\nhave focused our efforts in that direction, and are\r\naware of the responsibilities of the State towards\r\npersons living with HIV/AIDS. We have made a firm\r\ncommitment despite our limitations, which are\r\nessentially economic.\r\nIn that connection, my Government has, first,\r\nsteadily increased its budget in this regard and has\r\nprovided direct medical attention and training for\r\nhealth teams throughout the country. Secondly, we\r\nhave increasingly expanded treatment coverage.\r\nThanks to international support, that coverage is\r\ncurrently at 80 per cent. Thirdly, we have worked to\r\nimprove health and, through education and\r\ncommunication, to prevent the transmission of\r\nHIV/AIDS, while taking into account the factors that\r\nmust be addressed to bring about changes in sexual\r\nbehaviour.\r\nMoreover, my Government is convinced of the\r\nneed to strengthen the psychosocial elements that\r\nstrengthen prevention and comprehensive care in the\r\nareas of employment, education and health. My\r\nGovernment has therefore decided to institutionalize\r\nthis process through a law drafted jointly by\r\nParliament, the Government and persons living with\r\nHIV/AIDS. The President of Chile enacted that law in\r\nDecember 2001. As President Lagos has explained, the\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nlaw on the human immunodeficiency virus and tax\r\nbenefits for catastrophic illnesses is a powerful tool in\r\npreventing the spread of the disease, eliminating\r\ndiscrimination and determining the approach to be\r\ntaken in dealing with this catastrophic disease so as to\r\nbring it under control.\r\nChile is therefore focused not only on prevention,\r\nbut also on controlling the disease. This year’s budget\r\nfor testing and for financing tri-therapy has been\r\nincreased by about 30 per cent. That has enabled us to\r\nmake medicines available free of charge to a large\r\nnumber of patients in the public health care system. We\r\nhave also managed to finance treatment for over 3,000\r\npersons, including pregnant women and children.\r\nI think it is also necessary to highlight the\r\nimportant role played in this process by civil society,\r\nwhich has mobilized around this issue. That\r\nparticipation has been vital in calling for a response\r\nfrom Chilean society. In addition to organizing\r\nthemselves, they have been engaged in a legitimate\r\nmobilization process to demand responses to their\r\nrequests and to deal, often courageously, with\r\ndiscriminatory behaviour. As a specific example of\r\ncooperation, I would like to mention the project to\r\nspeed up and expand an intersectoral, participatory and\r\ndecentralized national response to the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic in Chile. That project, which has been\r\nfinanced by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, began to operate in March\r\n2002 and includes the participation of the Government,\r\nuniversities, non-governmental organizations and\r\ngroups of HIV-positive persons, among others. The\r\nproject has great value and has aroused significant\r\ninterest due to the work it is doing to reduce the gap\r\nbetween the current situation and the challenges that\r\nthe epidemic poses for the country, to ensure 100-per-\r\ncent treatment coverage, to guarantee the sustainability\r\nof actions by ensuring that they continue and, finally,\r\nto strengthen public-private partnerships.\r\nDespite the progress made and the optimistic\r\nmessages of the last year, I must say that Chile still has\r\nmany challenges and problems to overcome,\r\nparticularly with regard to the discrimination that\r\ncontinues to exist in some segments of society. Such\r\ndiscrimination has a range of consequences in a\r\nnumber of areas, particularly in the emotional sphere\r\nand in terms of exclusion from the workforce.\r\nIn closing, I would like to say that the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic challenges us as societies to devise both\r\nnational and global responses. In meeting that\r\nchallenge, there is no room for prejudice or rigid\r\nideological stances, which have no relationship to the\r\nurgent needs of groups affected and which make it\r\ndifficult to devise a satisfactory response that will\r\nmake it possible for us to stem the course of the\r\nepidemic. HIV/AIDS is an illness that affects us all.\r\nThe entire international community must continue to\r\ncooperate and work together to fight it.\r\nMrs. evčíková (Czech Republic): Allow me to\r\nstart by complimenting the Secretary-General and the\r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS\r\n(UNAIDS) for their work relating to the overall\r\nprocess leading to the adoption of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (see resolution S-26/2)\r\nduring the twenty-sixth special session, on HIV/AIDS,\r\nheld in June 2001. The twenty-sixth special session\r\nrepresented a very important step towards ensuring a\r\nglobal effort in the fight against HIV/AIDS. For the\r\nfirst time since the beginning of the epidemic, two\r\ndecades ago, we have a document that summarizes\r\ncommitments needed to reduce and eliminate the\r\nspread of this deadly disease. The Czech Republic\r\nappreciates the clarity of the document’s language and\r\nof the goals it set. We reiterate our commitment to\r\ncontribute to the global alliance to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nRelevant national targets from the Declaration of\r\nCommitment have become part of the new midterm\r\nplan for the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS in the\r\nCzech Republic for the period 2003 to 2007. Seven out\r\nof the nine UNAIDS national programme and\r\nbehavioural indicators have been incorporated into our\r\nnational plan against HIV/AIDS for the same period.\r\nThanks, among other things, to its relatively high\r\nstandards of health care, the Czech Republic has been\r\nlucky not to have been heavily affected by the\r\nepidemic so far. The incidence and prevalence of\r\nHIV/AIDS in our country are among the lowest in the\r\nworld. By August 2002, a total of 585 cases of HIV\r\ninfection had been diagnosed and reported out of a\r\ntotal of 10.3 million Czech citizens. Of that number,\r\nonly 161 persons have developed full-blown AIDS\r\ndisease, and 99 persons have died of HIV-related\r\ncauses.\r\nWe have been able to limit cases of HIV\r\ntransmission among injecting drug users thanks to\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nwidely accessible services for the exchange of needles\r\nand syringes. So far, we have avoided the experience of\r\nother Eastern European countries with regard to an\r\nexponential increase in new cases of HIV infection,\r\nespecially among injectors. Only three cases of mother-\r\nto-child transmission of HIV have been reported in our\r\ncountry. Among other things, that has been due to free\r\naccess to voluntary counselling services and mandatory\r\nprophylaxis for all mothers infected with the HIV\r\nvirus. We still have almost zero prevalence of HIV\r\ninfection among blood donors. Antiretroviral drugs are\r\naccessible to all persons in need of them, and their cost\r\nis covered by the national health insurance system and\r\nby the national AIDS programme budget.\r\nHowever, we feel solidarity with, and assume our\r\nshare of responsibility for, all the countries whose\r\npeople may have been affected on a much larger scale\r\nby HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or other diseases of a\r\nsimilar nature. Their example teaches us that nobody\r\ncan be safe from HIV/AIDS unless the whole planet\r\ncoordinates its efforts to eliminate it.\r\nIn our view, the establishment of a set of\r\nindicators by UNAIDS to measure national levels of\r\nresponse to the epidemic represents progress in\r\nmonitoring HIV at both the national and the\r\ninternational levels. We would like to see the UNAIDS\r\nProgramme Coordinating Board focus its attention\r\nmore on further developing indicators to measure the\r\nprogress made by the United Nations system in its\r\nresponse to the epidemic. The Czech Republic declares\r\nits readiness to contribute actively to the work of the\r\nBoard. To that end, we have already presented a Czech\r\ncandidate for a post on the Board for the period 2004 to\r\n2006.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my\r\nappreciation for the report of the Secretary General\r\ncontained in document A/57/227. We support\r\nintensified efforts to translate into practice the best\r\ninternational practices of other countries, using the\r\nauthority and leadership of UNAIDS. We welcome the\r\nstress placed on the importance of preserving the\r\nhuman rights of persons infected with HIV/AIDS, as\r\nwell as the importance of collaboration with non-\r\ngovernmental organizations in the field.\r\nWe fully identify ourselves with the statement\r\ndelivered on behalf of the European Union last Friday.\r\nTogether with the Union, we are especially ready to\r\nsupport specific interventions and prevention and\r\ntreatment capacities built at the local level to sustain an\r\neffective response to the pandemic.\r\nMr. Kulyk (Ukraine): Today we are addressing\r\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic, which continues to hamper\r\nthe attainment of sustainable development goals\r\nthroughout the world, to ravage the world’s population\r\nand to erode social and economic welfare. Over the\r\npast two decades, HIV/AIDS has dramatically spread\r\nto the every corner of the Earth. The epidemic\r\nincreasingly represents a global threat, and combating\r\nits devastating effects is a matter of particular\r\nimportance to all countries.\r\nThe international community has awakened to the\r\nscope and urgency of the HIV crisis. This was clearly\r\ndemonstrated by the focused attention given to this\r\nissue by world leaders at the Millennium Summit and\r\nat the twenty-sixth special session of the General\r\nAssembly, on HIV/AIDS, which was held in June 2001\r\non the initiative of Ukraine. We believe that the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, which was\r\nadopted at that session in resolution S-26/2, is an\r\nimportant framework and a crucial tool for mobilizing\r\nthe global response to the AIDS epidemic. It is\r\nessential that the implementation of the Declaration be\r\nviewed as an inherent part of a broader process towards\r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals. It is\r\ntherefore important that the issue of HIV/AIDS be\r\nintegrated into national sustainable development\r\npolicies and poverty reduction strategies.\r\nAccording to the Secretary-General’s report\r\n(A/57/270) on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the epidemic is growing fastest in Eastern\r\nEurope and Central Asia. Unfortunately, Ukraine ranks\r\namong the countries most seriously affected by the\r\ndisease. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS\r\nin Ukraine has been growing in the last 10 years.\r\nAccording to recent estimates, there are more than\r\n48,000 people in Ukraine officially registered as being\r\ninfected with HIV. The number of those registered,\r\nhowever, is believed to be just the tip of the iceberg.\r\nReportedly, there may be as many as 400,000\r\nUkrainians living with HIV/AIDS. That figure amounts\r\nto about 1 per cent of the country’s adult population.\r\nCurrently, 71 per cent of the people registered as being\r\ninfected with HIV/AIDS contracted the virus through\r\nintravenous drug use. But recent trends show that HIV\r\nis spreading from infected injecting drug users to their\r\nsexual partners, who are often non-injecting drug users,\r\nthereby widening the HIV crisis.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nThe Ukrainian leadership has demonstrated its\r\nstrong dedication to addressing the growing HIV/AIDS\r\nproblem, preventing a full-blown epidemic and\r\nalleviating the negative consequences of the disease on\r\nthe Ukrainian people. The President of Ukraine is\r\nleading national efforts in the HIV/AIDS challenge.\r\nThe creation by presidential decree in 2000 of a\r\nGovernment commission to combat HIV/AIDS and the\r\nproclamation of 2002 as the year to fight AIDS in\r\nUkraine testify to the fact that this issue is being given\r\npriority attention by the State.\r\nFully aware of the pervasive and destructive\r\nimpact of AIDS and its devastating consequences, the\r\nUkrainian leadership formulated a strategy to respond\r\neffectively. That strategy is outlined in the 2001-2003\r\nnational programme for the prevention of HIV/AIDS in\r\nUkraine. That document charted a comprehensive\r\napproach to HIV/AIDS-related issues, and serves as a\r\nroad map for a national alliance to fight the virus. It\r\nhas gained the full support of the various United\r\nNations agencies and other international organizations.\r\nThe first and foremost priority of our policy-makers\r\nremains prevention of new infections. Sustained efforts\r\ncontinue to ensure prevention among injecting drug\r\nusers and young people, prevention and treatment of\r\nsexually transmitted infections, prevention of mother-\r\nto-child HIV transmission, and expanding access to\r\ncare and treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe wish also to stress that Ukraine has already\r\nincorporated HIV/AIDS awareness training into the\r\nnational training programmes for military personnel in\r\npreparation for deployment.\r\nIt is crucial to harness the momentum of the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s special session on HIV/AIDS to\r\nthe mobilization of the United Nations system.\r\nStronger and more coordinated activities on the part of\r\nthe Organization are required to fortify HIV/AIDS\r\nefforts at the global and national levels and to provide\r\nmore effective assistance to countries.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that concrete measures\r\nhave been taken by various United Nations agencies,\r\nfunds and programmes, especially the World Bank, the\r\nInternational Labour Organization, the United Nations\r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the\r\nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund, in order to build on national capacity\r\nand strengthen HIV/AIDS programmes at the country\r\nlevel. In this context, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its appreciation of the important activities and\r\nsignificant role played by the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and co-\r\nsponsoring agencies in the global alliance against the\r\nepidemic. In Ukraine, the Programme forged a series of\r\npartnership relations with both governmental\r\ninstitutions and non-governmental organizations.\r\nSeveral projects on HIV/AIDS are being implemented\r\nin Ukraine. We strongly hope that the UNAIDS\r\nactivities in my country shall be further expanded and\r\nintensified.\r\nMy delegation also commends the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative on the creation of the Global Fund\r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in order to\r\nstrengthen global capacity to mobilize additional\r\nfinancial resources to support the national strategies\r\nagainst the epidemic. Ukraine, as a member of the\r\nBoard of the Global Fund, will do its best to put into\r\npractice its experience in addressing the HIV/AIDS\r\nchallenge. It is clear that the currently available funds\r\nwill meet only part of the needs of the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. In this regard, we would like to urge the\r\ndonor community to increase its invaluable support.\r\nUkraine has committed itself to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goal of halting and reversing AIDS and\r\nis making every effort, despite daunting economic\r\nchallenges, towards its achievement. Ukraine is\r\nconvinced that the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, rather than being a final destination,\r\nestablishes a platform for building a global partnership\r\nagainst the epidemic.\r\nIf the potential of this process is to be fully\r\nmeasured and utilized, coherent policy dialogue should\r\nbe further pursued. In this regard, we wish to stress the\r\nimportance of having a one-day debate at the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly to review and\r\ndiscuss the progress in follow-up to the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS. It is also important that\r\nthis debate be held during or close to the high-level\r\nsegment and with the participation of civil society.\r\nMr. Baduri (Eritrea): The Secretary-General\r\nshould be commended for his comprehensive report,\r\ncontained in documents A/57/227 and A/57/227/Corr.1,\r\nsubmitted under the agenda item under discussion. I\r\nwish also to commend the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World\r\nHealth Organization for their valuable inputs into this\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nexcellent report and for their efforts in fighting this\r\nterrible disease around the globe.\r\nMy delegation finds this report powerfully\r\nengaging. It serves as a loud wake-up call to us all, rich\r\nand poor. It is disturbing to learn from this report that,\r\neven after world leaders adopted the Declaration of\r\nCommitment in June 2001 to curb this killer disease,\r\nresponses have been far below expectations. The\r\nSecretary-General therefore warns the international\r\ncommunity that, in the absence of a substantial\r\nstrengthening of the global response to HIV/AIDS, 45\r\nmillion new infections are projected to occur between\r\nnow and the year 2010. The report further states that\r\neffective prevention programmes currently reach fewer\r\nthan 20 per cent of those at high risk of infection and\r\nthat only a small fraction of the world’s 40 million\r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS has access to treatment\r\nfor HIV, opportunistic infections or alleviation of pain.\r\nThe growing global HIV/AIDS crisis will continue to\r\nbe a real threat unless the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration is given utmost priority.\r\nMy delegation finds it even more disturbing to\r\nnote what this life-threatening pandemic is doing to our\r\nyoung ones — the very embodiments of hope for the\r\nfuture. The report says that\r\n“Despite the dramatic increase in the number of\r\nchildren orphaned by HIV/AIDS, nearly one in\r\ntwo countries lacks a strategy for care and\r\nsupport of children orphaned or made vulnerable\r\nby the epidemic.” (A/57/227, summary)\r\nOur Secretary-General rightly reiterates that\r\n“The Declaration reflects global recognition of\r\nthe epidemic as the single greatest threat to the\r\nwell-being of future generations.” (ibid, para. 2)\r\nMy delegation shares the Secretary-General’s\r\nfrustration on the slow and limited responses that, in\r\nsome cases, are too little, too late. He admits that,\r\nwhile\r\n“most countries have developed national AIDS\r\nstrategies… implementation of these is slow,\r\nlargely owing to lack of resources and technical\r\ncapacity”. (ibid., para. 7)\r\nIt was on this point that my delegation took the\r\npodium to inform this Assembly of activities that have\r\nbeen taking place in Eritrea regarding the subject under\r\ndiscussion. Since I have annexed an extensive report\r\nfrom the Ministry of Health of the State of Eritrea to\r\nmy statement, I will be brief, but I request that this\r\nannexed report be part of the official records of this\r\nAssembly.\r\nConsidering its small population of 3.5 million;\r\nan acute shortage of trained and experienced\r\nprofessionals; and a lack of resources for health care,\r\neducation and job creation, Eritrea has expressly\r\ndeclared the fight against the AIDS pandemic as its top\r\npriority. To this end, my Government has established a\r\nNational AIDS Control Programme (NACP) under the\r\nMinistry of Health. Through this programme, the\r\nGovernment has mobilized an effective multisectoral\r\nresponse to HIV/AIDS. Even during the difficult times\r\nof conflict with Ethiopia and in the post-conflict\r\nperiod, my Government has been fervently fighting the\r\nspread of this disease with the support of the United\r\nNations system and other partners.\r\nThe NACP estimates that between 30,000 and\r\n70,000 Eritreans are living with the HIV infection. If\r\nthis killer epidemic is left uncontrolled, it could have a\r\ndevastating effect on the country’s human and\r\neconomic development potential. The spread of this\r\nterrible disease is alarming. Reported AIDS cases in\r\nEritrea have risen from eight in 1988 to over 13,500 in\r\n2001. In 2001 alone, 2,759 cases were reported to the\r\nMinistry of Health. Analysts in the Ministry of Health\r\nsay that the doubling time for reported AIDS cases is\r\napproximately 18 months. In terms of impact on health\r\nservices, AIDS ranked as the tenth cause of death in\r\nhospitals and health centres in 1996, but was the\r\nsecond leading cause of death in 2000. An HIV\r\nbehavioural and sero-survey conducted by the Ministry\r\nof Health among five population subgroups in 2001\r\nshowed the following seroprevalence rates in the\r\ncountry: general population — 2.3 per cent; secondary\r\nschool students — 0.1 per cent; clinic attendees — 2.8\r\nper cent; the military — 4.6 per cent; and female bar\r\nworkers, including commercial sex workers — 22.8 per\r\ncent.\r\nThe findings revealed that the majority of the\r\nrespondents have a low-risk perception of contracting\r\nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. Females\r\nare more likely to claim that they are at no risk at all,\r\nas compared to their male counterparts. A high\r\nproportion of bartenders and military personnel — 60\r\nper cent and 62 per cent respectively — perceived\r\nthemselves as being at no risk at all of contracting\r\nHIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. The\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nyounger population, however, perceived a low risk\r\nbecause of the use of condoms or of one sexual partner.\r\nThe older age groups, on the other hand, perceived low\r\nto no risk of contracting because of either only one\r\nsexual partner or abstention from sexual activities.\r\nEthiopia’s military invasion of my country in\r\nMay 2000 drove nearly one third of the Eritrean\r\npopulation from their homes and villages into\r\ntemporary camps. HIV/AIDS spreads fastest in\r\nconditions of instability and powerlessness, which are\r\noften at their most extreme during emergencies. Thus,\r\nthe Government of Eritrea quickly adopted measures to\r\nprevent the rapid spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in\r\nemergency and post-emergency situations. The\r\ndisintegration of communities in times of humanitarian\r\ncrisis and mobilization of sexually active youth and the\r\nmiddle aged — 18-40 years old — into the military has\r\ncontributed immensely to the rapid spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nThe strategic five-year plan to combat HIV/AIDS\r\nin Eritrea — 1997-2002 — underlines the importance\r\nof multisectoral and multilateral approaches to this\r\nkiller disease. The Ministry of Health has joined in\r\npartnership with other Government sectors, as well as\r\nnon-governmental organizations, community-based\r\ninstitutions, faith-based organizations, the private\r\nsector and other elements of civil society, to respond to\r\nthe epidemic. Activities are integrated at several levels\r\nand are supported by the World Bank-financed\r\nHIV/AIDS, Malaria, Sexually Transmitted Infections\r\n(STI) and Tuberculosis Control Project (HAMSET).\r\nThey are being implemented by a variety of partners\r\nfrom many sectors working at central, zonal and\r\ncommunity levels, under the leadership of the Ministry\r\nof Health.\r\nAlthough the activities that have been carried on\r\nthus far provide a strong foundation for our fight\r\nagainst the disease, not nearly enough has been done to\r\ncounter the magnitude of the threat that the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic poses to Eritrea. In order to make a\r\nsignificant contribution to the prevention of HIV\r\ntransmission, ensure that people living with HIV/AIDS\r\nare cared for adequately and increase the scope and\r\nspeed of our response, additional resources are needed.\r\nIt is fair to say that Eritrea is on the verge of a\r\ngeneralized HIV/AIDS epidemic. Military personnel\r\ncurrently in the frontlines, who have a high rate of\r\ninfection, will come back home to their families and\r\ncommunities with the infection when demobilized. The\r\nGovernment will intervene in a significant way to\r\nprevent the spread of infection upon the soldiers’ return\r\nin the coming months. The national prevention\r\nprogramme will include the promotion of safer sexual\r\nbehaviour, improved management of sexually\r\ntransmitted infections, voluntary counselling and\r\ntesting, prevention of mother-to-child transmission and\r\nusing safer skin-cutting and piercing practices.\r\nEritrea is determined to aggressively fight this\r\nlife-threatening epidemic, and it must succeed. Eritrea\r\nis committed to improving its capacity to prevent, care\r\nfor and support people infected with and affected by\r\nHIV/AIDS. But it cannot do it alone. It requires\r\ninternational assistance. Therefore, I cannot help but\r\nappeal to the world donor community for resources and\r\ndrugs to make my country’s life-saving HIV/AIDS\r\nprogramme a success.\r\nMs. Pulido Santana (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): It has been almost a year and a half since a\r\nhistoric special session took place in this very hall,\r\nwhich was dedicated to the millions of people around\r\nthe world whose lives have been affected by the\r\nterrible HIV/AIDS epidemic. With the special session\r\nof the General Assembly devoted to HIV/AIDS in all\r\nits aspects, the United Nations broke its years-long\r\nsilence on the challenging reality of the HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic.\r\nWithout doubt, that meeting marked a landmark\r\nin the epidemic’s evolution, as it was the first time that\r\nheads of State or Government from around the world\r\nmet to discuss and adopt a common agenda to address a\r\nhealth issue.\r\nThe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS\r\nadopted by the special session of the General Assembly\r\non HIV/AIDS is also a historic document. It amply\r\naddresses all aspects of the epidemic and establishes\r\ncollective goals whose fulfilment will enable us to curb\r\nthe spread of the disease and respond appropriately to\r\nthose infected by it.\r\nFor Venezuela, one of the most significant\r\nachievements resulting from the special session is the\r\ncomprehensive treatment of all aspects of the epidemic.\r\nPrevention, reduction of the vulnerability of specific\r\ngroups to the disease, treatment, care and support for\r\nthose living with HIV/AIDS and respect for their\r\nhuman rights are all elements that, in conformity with\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment, must receive equal\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nattention in confronting HIV/AIDS. That new vision\r\nleft behind the idea that poor or middle-income\r\ncountries must focus exclusively on preventing new\r\ninfections because of the lack of sufficient resources to\r\nacquire available treatments or to care for their infected\r\npopulations. Thus a door of hope had been opened for\r\nmillions of people that had previously been closed.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on progress towards implementation\r\nof the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS\r\n(A/27/227 and Corr.1), which presents a general\r\noverview that enables us to assess the pace at which we\r\nare collectively moving towards the implementation of\r\nthe goals adopted last year. The report points out that\r\nmuch remains to be done in the field of developing\r\nnational strategies for HIV/AIDS. Those national\r\nstrategies are the basis for national action with regard\r\nto all aspects of the epidemic, and international\r\ncooperation and technical assistance are channelled\r\nthrough them.\r\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that the\r\ncharacteristics of today’s world resulting from the\r\nglobalization process cause the repercussions of\r\nphenomena such as HIV/AIDS to be felt in various\r\nlatitudes. Phenomena such as the increase in migratory\r\nmovements and large-scale tourism are factors that can\r\nindirectly affect the spread of the epidemic from one\r\npart of the world to another. Therefore, we need\r\nnational responses that enable us to contain the spread\r\nof HIV/AIDS and to meet the objective, contained in\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment, to establish and\r\nimplement in 2003 broad multisectoral national\r\nfinancing strategies and plans to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe reduction in the cost of certain antiretroviral\r\ndrug combinations and the conclusion of agreements\r\nwith the pharmaceutical industry to reduce the price of\r\nmedicines needed to treat HIV/AIDS — particularly\r\nafter the adoption of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment — are encouraging. Moreover, the efforts\r\nof the World Health Organization and the Declaration\r\nmade at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), held at Doha, in which\r\nWTO member States unanimously declared that the\r\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\r\nProperty Rights “can and should be interpreted and\r\nimplemented in a manner supportive of WTO\r\nmembers’ right to protect public health and, in\r\nparticular, to promote access to medicines for all”,\r\nindicate that there is a clear willingness on the part of\r\nthe international community to deal effectively with the\r\nissue of HIV/AIDS.\r\nNevertheless, we must emphasize the need to\r\nundertake and explore action in other areas. Prevention\r\nremains a fundamental element in the fight against the\r\nepidemic, as the examples of Senegal, Thailand and\r\nUganda have demonstrated. The Secretary-General\r\npoints out in his report that programmes directed at\r\nspecific populations whose characteristics make them\r\nmore vulnerable to HIV/AIDS continue to face various\r\nobstacles in their design and application.\r\nWe observe that the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nwhile recognizing that women, together with marginal\r\ngroups, bear a large part of the stigma associated with\r\nHIV/AIDS, gives no account of activities undertaken to\r\ndeal with that reality. HIV/AIDS has had a\r\ndisproportionate impact on women, and that has taken\r\nplace in a process of feminization of the epidemic. That\r\nis why control over decisions related to their sexuality\r\nis a tool that would allow women to protect themselves\r\nfrom HIV and should be seen as a prevention strategy\r\nin itself, given that it improves and enhances the ability\r\nto reduce the risk of vertical mother-to-child\r\ntransmission. Nevertheless, we see that little progress\r\nhas been made in that area.\r\nVenezuela has tackled the issue of HIV/AIDS\r\nfrom a human-rights-based perspective, which assumes\r\nthat the guarantee to the right of health is a social right.\r\nIt also includes respect for the dignity of the human\r\nrights of those affected by the disease and the legal\r\nprotection of persons living with HIV/AIDS,\r\nrecognized by courts in the areas of the workplace, the\r\nfamily, education, health and medical care, access to\r\ntreatment, freedom, personal safety and privacy. We\r\nattach great importance to eliminating the stigma and\r\ndiscrimination associated with HIV/AIDS, given that,\r\nin the majority of cases, they prevent the full\r\nenjoyment of human rights by those affected by the\r\ndisease. Therefore, we welcome the fact that the World\r\nAIDS Campaign is focusing on fighting stigmatization\r\nand discrimination in order to give prominence to\r\nhuman rights in global activities to fight the pandemic.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to express its\r\nsupport for the recommendation made by the\r\nSecretary-General to devote an entire day to assessing\r\nprogress in attaining the goals of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment, within the framework of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Having been\r\nactively involved in its drafting and adoption,\r\nLiechtenstein is firmly committed to the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS and to its implementation.\r\nWe warmly endorse the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General on implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment, and we pledge our full\r\nsupport to the joint effort of the United Nations to\r\nmake HIV/AIDS a scourge of the past.\r\nWe deem it of the highest importance that\r\nHIV/AIDS is considered not merely a social and health\r\nproblem, but rather an issue with the strongest\r\nimplications for economic and development issues, and\r\nwe therefore note with satisfaction the increasing\r\nawareness in that respect. We are grateful to the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\r\nfor its tremendous efforts and for the very useful report\r\n(A/57/227 and Corr.1) that is now before the General\r\nAssembly. Both the report and the oral presentation of\r\nUNAIDS Executive Director Peter Piot before the\r\nSecond and Third Committees lead us to conclude that\r\nwe can succeed in our common fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS and that we need to do much more in order\r\nto be successful.\r\nAs is the case when one fights any scourge, the\r\ncosts of prevention are much smaller than the financial\r\nand social costs of failure to prevent. The causes\r\nfacilitating the spread of HIV/AIDS may differ among\r\ncultures and societies, and, accordingly, the most\r\neffective means to prevent HIV/AIDS may likewise\r\ndiffer.\r\nHowever, it is indisputable that, regardless of\r\ncultural background, some factors will always\r\ncontribute to the destructive spread of HIV/AIDS,\r\nincluding poverty, inadequate access to education and\r\nin particular information on sexual and reproductive\r\nhealth. Inadequate access to health care, in particular\r\nsexual and reproductive health care and services, and\r\ndiscrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS\r\nplay a fatal role in the spread of the disease.\r\nThis last point is worth emphasizing. Both the\r\nconsequences of HIV/AIDS and its eradication are\r\ninextricably linked to human rights. People living with\r\nHIV/AIDS are often also victims of discrimination by\r\ntheir societies, their Governments and sometimes even\r\ntheir families. Such discrimination not only violates the\r\nhuman rights and dignity of the persons affected,\r\nthereby depriving them of the opportunities in life they\r\nare entitled to enjoy, but also, tragically, assists\r\nHIV/AIDS in causing more destruction.\r\nThere is often a misconception that providing\r\nassistance to people living with HIV/AIDS somehow\r\nfacilitates its spread, when in fact such assistance helps\r\nprevent such a spread by providing people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS with the information and health care they\r\nneed to lead their lives in dignity and to protect others\r\nfrom infection. Only by eliminating discrimination can\r\nthis misconception and its severe consequences be\r\ncountered. Only by openly acknowledging the fact that\r\nHIV/AIDS exists and poses a very grave threat can the\r\npandemic be fought effectively, at the international and\r\nparticularly at the national level.\r\nWe would like to draw attention to the plight of\r\nchildren affected by HIV/AIDS. Access to reproductive\r\nand prenatal health services plays an essential role in\r\nreducing the number of children born with HIV by\r\npreventing transmission of the virus from mother to\r\nchild. Any child born infected by HIV is an\r\ninexcusable failure in our efforts to protect the most\r\nvulnerable members of society from the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS. Similarly, children whose parents have not\r\nsurvived HIV/AIDS must be afforded the social\r\nservices necessary to help them overcome their loss\r\nand to ensure their future.\r\nWhen, despite our best efforts, prevention fails,\r\nthe human right of people living with HIV/AIDS to\r\nadequate health care must be recognized. Treatment of\r\npeople with HIV/AIDS, both against the virus itself\r\nand against opportunistic infections, must be a priority\r\nin the global implementation of our Declaration of\r\nCommitment. The core component of such treatment is\r\nthe development of, and adequate access to,\r\nmedications able to contain and eventually cure\r\nHIV/AIDS. Protecting intellectual property rights is an\r\nimportant tool in encouraging the development of more\r\npotent medical treatments; at the same time,\r\nintellectual property rights should not be construed as\r\nan impediment to the realization of the right to health.\r\nIn all our endeavours to free the world from\r\nHIV/AIDS, we will not succeed if we neglect to\r\nencourage and recognize the vital participation in these\r\nendeavours of people living with HIV/AIDS. People\r\nliving with HIV/AIDS have immediate knowledge of\r\nthe ways in which HIV/AIDS affects human lives, and\r\ntheir input is essential in making our policies work.\r\nParticipation in decisions affecting their lives is not\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nonly something they are entitled to; it is also an\r\nessential ingredient of our success.\r\nWe acknowledge that the fight against HIV/AIDS\r\nwill be successful only if sufficient financial means are\r\ncommitted to this undertaking. While investments at\r\nthe national level are of the utmost importance, we\r\nbelieve that the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria represents a key component\r\nof a successful worldwide strategy to eliminate\r\nHIV/AIDS. Liechtenstein has therefore contributed to\r\nthe Fund, and we encourage States that have not yet\r\ndone so to do likewise.\r\nMr. Ali (Malaysia): At the outset, I wish to say\r\nthat my delegation associates itself with the statement\r\ndelivered by Brunei Darussalam on behalf of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on\r\nthe agenda item under consideration. However, I wish\r\nto take this opportunity to make a brief statement on\r\nissues of particular concern to my delegation.\r\nSince the HIV/AIDS pandemic began, almost 58\r\nmillion people throughout the world have been infected\r\nwith HIV, and almost 22 million have died. HIV\r\ncontinues to spread, causing more than 15,000 new\r\ninfections every day. Of these, 95 per cent occur in\r\nlow- and middle-income countries.\r\nHIV/AIDS is the fourth leading cause of death\r\nworldwide. It is threatening to wipe out decades of\r\ninvestments in education and in human development,\r\nparticularly in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa and in\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. No longer simply a\r\nhealth problem, the pandemic is becoming a “total\r\nhuman problem” and a development disaster. It is\r\nespecially serious among young adults. Recent figures\r\nindicate that the number of cases is increasing rapidly\r\nin Eastern Europe and in Asia. Some of the countries\r\nhardest hit could lose more than 20 per cent of their\r\ngross domestic product as a result of AIDS.\r\nDespite advances in treatment and care, which are\r\nwidely available in high-income countries, HIV/AIDS\r\nprevention programmes and related health-care\r\ninfrastructure are lagging behind in low- and middle-\r\nincome countries, where the pandemic is most\r\nprevalent. It is therefore imperative for the developed\r\ncountries to assist the rest, in recognition of the fact\r\nthat HIV/AIDS does not recognize borders.\r\nIn this regard, my delegation fully endorses the\r\nrecommendation made by the Secretary-General that,\r\nin order to ensure an effective response to HIV/AIDS,\r\nthe international community should be urged to\r\nincrease its assistance significantly to countries which\r\ndo not have sufficient resources for intervention, the\r\nstrengthening of sustainable human capacity, systems\r\ndevelopment and capacity-building.\r\nWe also fully support his call for global research\r\npriorities to reflect the pandemic’s disproportionate\r\nimpact on low- and middle-income countries. The\r\nmagnitude and proportion of research funding devoted\r\nto HIV-related questions facing developing countries\r\nshould be significantly increased. The search for a safe\r\nand effective preventive vaccine must be an urgent\r\nglobal priority, with greater investments being made by\r\nthe public as well as the private sectors in both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nHaving said that, my delegation recognizes that\r\nGovernments themselves have a crucial role to play in\r\ncombating the pandemic. States should develop\r\nnational strategic plans to combat HIV/AIDS and\r\nintegrate this focus into national development plans\r\nand poverty-reduction strategies. Such strategies\r\nshould reflect the gender dimensions of the pandemic.\r\nStates should also develop comprehensive strategies to\r\nsupport those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS,\r\nincluding orphans.\r\nIn the development of strategies, my delegation\r\nstrongly supports strengthened collaboration between\r\nGovernments and the private sector, civil society,\r\npeople living with HIV/AIDS and vulnerable groups in\r\nthe fight against the deadly disease.\r\nTo combat the pandemic, Malaysia has\r\nestablished an Inter-Sectoral Committee, charged with\r\nthe responsibility of formulating policies, strategies,\r\nprogrammes and activities, as well as coordinating a\r\nnationwide AIDS prevention and control programme.\r\nIn turn, every State has its own Coordinating\r\nCommittee on AIDS, responsible for the\r\nimplementation and coordination of activities at the\r\nlocal level. To further strengthen the collaborative\r\napproach, an inter-ministerial committee was\r\nestablished that brings together 14 ministries as well as\r\nthe Malaysian AIDS Council, an umbrella organization\r\nof non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working\r\ntogether to fight HIV/AIDS.\r\nStrategies employed by the Government to\r\ncombat HIV/AIDS include, first, a surveillance\r\nprogramme for the collection, collation and distribution\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nof data pertaining to the pandemic and for case\r\nnotification; secondly, routine HIV screening among\r\nvulnerable groups on a voluntary and confidential\r\nbasis; thirdly, screening of blood and blood products;\r\nfourthly, prevention through a strategy of informing\r\nand educating the public; fifthly, inter-agency\r\ncollaboration, to which I referred earlier; and sixthly,\r\ntreatment, care and support. While prevention is the\r\nmainstay of Malaysia’s response to the pandemic, we\r\nrecognize that care, support and treatment are also\r\nfundamental, and we therefore include those elements\r\nas part of an effective, overall response.\r\nThe immediate future does not seem to hold much\r\nhope for people living with HIV/AIDS. States must\r\nensure that commitments are converted into concrete\r\naction in order to attain the goals enumerated in the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at\r\nlast year’s special session. The international\r\ncommunity should, for its part, fulfil its social\r\nresponsibility and assist in generating the new,\r\nadditional and sustained resources necessary to ensure\r\nthat States can effectively meet the challenges posed by\r\nHIV/AIDS. Action is long overdue. We must, for the\r\nsake of humanity, meet the challenge and emerge the\r\nwinner.\r\nMr. Jalango (Kenya): It is an honour and a\r\npleasure for me to address the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-seventh session on the important subject on\r\nHIV/AIDS and on progress towards implementing the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, 16 months\r\nafter the holding of the special session of the General\r\nAssembly on the subject.\r\nMy delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report before us, which forms the basis\r\nof our deliberations. My delegation also extends its\r\nsincere gratitude to the Executive Director of the Joint\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS),\r\nDr. Peter Piot, for his joint briefing of the Second and\r\nThird Committees under this agenda item two weeks\r\nago and for his commitment to this very important\r\nissue.\r\nI would like to turn to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on progress towards the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration. We note from the report that most\r\ncountries have developed national AIDS strategies but\r\nimplementation has been hampered by a lack of\r\nresources and technical capacity. We also note that\r\ncommendable programmes fail to achieve their full\r\nimpact because they remain small in scale and lack a\r\ncomprehensive approach.\r\nThe report underscores the fact that the\r\nDeclaration reflects global recognition of the\r\nHIV/AIDS epidemic as the greatest threat to humanity\r\nand the well-being of future generations. My\r\ndelegation is concerned about the comments of the\r\nSecretary-General in paragraph 3 of the report that\r\n“The epidemic cannot be reversed without a substantial\r\nstrengthening of the worldwide response”. Effective\r\nprevention programmes currently reach fewer than 20\r\nper cent of those at high risk of infection, and only a\r\nsmall fraction of the world’s 40 million people living\r\nwith HIV/AIDS have access to treatment, including for\r\nopportunistic infections or even for the alleviation of\r\npain. This is proof enough that the fight against the\r\nscourge is far from being won. Effective interventions\r\nthat have a lasting impact are required now more than\r\never before.\r\nThe urgency of this situation results from the fact\r\nthat, given the speed at which the epidemic is\r\nspreading globally and its extent, countries in the\r\ndeveloping world are able neither to keep pace nor to\r\ntackle the backlog of economic injustice and social\r\ninequality. We have seen from the report that the\r\nresponse to the epidemic by the leadership in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa has, indeed, been enhanced. Hence, 40\r\ncountries now have national strategies, as compared\r\nwith 14 three years ago, while 19 have national AIDS\r\ncouncils — up from only three. African Governments\r\nhave been forced to devote their limited resources to\r\ncombating the epidemic to such an extent that it is\r\nhaving an impact on other priority areas, such as\r\npoverty eradication, education, water, sanitation and\r\nhunger and malnutrition. We must continue to be\r\nvigilant and become even more conscious of the danger\r\nof neglecting child-related problems when prioritizing\r\neconomic and social issues. The increase in HIV/AIDS\r\ncases has resulted in an unprecedented number of\r\norphaned children. In Kenya, for example, the number\r\nof orphaned children has increased to 1.8 million, as\r\ncompared with 1 million three years ago.\r\nYou will therefore begin to understand, Mr.\r\nPresident, why Kenya’s head of State and Government,\r\nPresident Daniel Arap Moi, declared a state of\r\nemergency with regard to HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn order to address the resource gap, Kenya\r\nsubmitted a proposal for funding to the Global Fund to\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria amounting to a\r\ntotal of $173,422, broken down as follows: $129,054\r\nfor HIV/AIDS; $11,232 for tuberculosis; and $33,586\r\nfor malaria, which is another killer.\r\nDespite the constraints on the Fund and the\r\nnumber of requests submitted to it, Kenya strongly\r\nappeals for its proposal to be considered favourably. If\r\nit is approved, it will assist the country in scaling up\r\nexisting interventions.\r\nAllow me to inform the Assembly briefly about\r\nthe actions that Kenya has taken at the national level.\r\nFirst, the Kenyan Government is strengthening its\r\nmonitoring and evaluation systems. Secondly, the\r\nreport of the task force on legal issues has now been\r\nfinalized, and a draft bill is being discussed with\r\nstakeholders. However, following the dissolution of the\r\nNational Assembly in preparation for national elections\r\nin December 2002, it is expected that the bill will be\r\ndiscussed as a priority in the next parliament. Thirdly,\r\nthe Industrial Property Act has been amended to allow\r\nimportation of generic antiretroviral drugs, which are\r\nmore affordable. Fourthly, efforts to make\r\nantiretroviral drugs accessible to a wider population are\r\nalso under way in several avenues. Fifthly, in this\r\nregard, my delegation calls for support from the United\r\nNations Global Fund on HIV/AIDS and other donor\r\npartners to help us in this fight.\r\nThe report highlights the need to develop\r\ncomprehensive strategies to support orphans and other\r\nvulnerable children. I wish to report that the guidelines\r\nfor orphans and vulnerable children are almost\r\nfinalized. These guidelines, inter alia, seek to address\r\nissues of programming, strengthen the economic\r\ncapacity of families, advocate for the right to education\r\nand offer guidance in child protection as well as\r\nstigmatization.\r\nKenya has established a National AIDS Control\r\nCouncil, which has mandated all Government\r\nMinistries to set up AIDS Control Units charged with\r\nthe responsibility of sensitizing employees on\r\nHIV/AIDS, as well as advocacy and prevention. This is\r\ncarried out at the provincial, district and constituency\r\nlevels, thereby maximizing coverage nationwide.\r\nMoreover, key actors in our intervention programmes\r\ncontinue to include members of the private sector, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, religious organizations\r\nand civil society.\r\nIn addition, people living with HIV and AIDS\r\nhave been recognized as critical partners in the fight\r\nagainst HIV/AIDS, especially with regard to reducing\r\nisolation and stigma by providing psychological,\r\nmaterial and social support. Indeed, in most of our\r\nsensitization seminars, people living with AIDS act as\r\nresource persons and thereby give the scourge a face —\r\nthat is, one is dealing no longer with an abstract\r\nconcept, but with a reality affecting ordinary people. In\r\nthis regard, we have made great strides in bringing\r\npeople living with HIV and AIDS together under an\r\numbrella body, the Network of People Living With\r\nHIV And AIDS in Kenya. This body has drawn up a\r\ndraft constitution that has been widely adopted its\r\nmembers.\r\nIn the private sector, the Kenya HIV/AIDS\r\nBusiness Council plays a major role in designing\r\nprevention programmes in work places and in\r\nfinancing interventions for care and support. To this\r\nend, several companies have included HIV/AIDS\r\nmessages in their codes of regulation. For example, the\r\nFederation of Kenya Employers has identified\r\nguidelines of operation at work places that outline the\r\nmanner in which HIV/AIDS cases can be handled. The\r\ncode has been applauded by most of its members. In a\r\ncase in point, Unilever Kenya has embarked on a\r\nprogramme to bring together companies to write and\r\nset aside funds for employees who fall sick in the\r\ncourse of employment. The Kenya judiciary also has an\r\ninsurance policy that fully covers people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS. Religious groups have also come together\r\nto fight HIV/AIDS under an umbrella body, the Inter-\r\nReligious AIDS Committee.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nKenya is serious about meeting the commitments\r\nof the Declaration and will endeavour to strengthen its\r\ninterventions, partnerships and efforts towards the\r\nsame. In May 2002, the first-ever joint HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes review was held, bringing together over\r\n120 stakeholders working on HIV/AIDS in the country.\r\nOne of the major outcomes of this joint meeting was a\r\nmemorandum of understanding that will be signed by\r\nkey stakeholders on how to continue implementation of\r\nthe Kenya National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan. As we\r\napproach the 2002 elections, it is our understanding\r\nthat the National AIDS Control Council has developed\r\nappropriate HIV/AIDS messages and passed them on to\r\ncontestants for dissemination as they go around\r\ncampaigning in the country.\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nIn conclusion, Kenya still requires support from\r\nthe international community to supplement its tireless\r\nefforts. Monitoring and evaluation are one area that is\r\nin dire need of strengthening. Assistance in this area\r\nwill help Kenya to achieve the desired targets. In this\r\nrespect, allow me to thank all those development\r\npartners, particularly the World Bank, United Nations\r\nagencies and programmes, non-governmental\r\norganizations, civil society and community-based\r\norganizations, without which we would not have\r\naccomplished what we have achieved so far. Together,\r\nwe can see some light at the end of the tunnel.\r\nMr. Gaspar Martins (Angola): I have the honour\r\nto address the Assembly on behalf of the Southern\r\nAfrica Development Community (SADC), which\r\nincludes Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,\r\nNamibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland,\r\nTanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and my own country,\r\nAngola.\r\nThe twenty-sixth special session of the General\r\nAssembly on HIV/AIDS, through its outcome\r\ndocument, the Declaration of Commitment on\r\nHIV/AIDS, was a significant turning point in the global\r\nresponse to the epidemic. The Secretary-General’ s\r\nreport on the progress made in the implementation of\r\nthe Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS is\r\nforward-looking, as it highlights the achievements\r\nmade and potential challenges that need our\r\ncollaborative and urgent attention. The report makes\r\nvery critical recommendations, which SADC will\r\nconsider in addressing this human catastrophe.\r\nHIV/AIDS has now become the scourge of\r\nAfrica, where 28 million of the 40 million HIV/AIDS\r\npatients worldwide are to be found. Statistics indicate\r\nthat, of the 40 million people living with HIV/AIDS,\r\n28 million are in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nThe pandemic is afflicting all SADC States in varying\r\ndegrees of intensity and is propelled across the\r\nboundaries of States through cross-border movements.\r\nAs such, the strategies to combat the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS have a regional focus which transcends\r\nnational policies. Harmonization and coordination of\r\nthe regional response, therefore, would ensure mutually\r\nbeneficial regional integration.\r\nHIV/AIDS is decimating a large percentage of the\r\nworking population in SADC, with serious\r\nimplications for economic growth and for efforts to\r\neradicate poverty. In this regard, many SADC countries\r\nhave experienced slow economic growth. The\r\nprevalence of HIV/AIDS is very high in the SADC\r\nregion. For example, in Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland\r\nand Zimbabwe, 24 to 36 per cent of the population\r\naged 15 to 49 is living with AIDS. Consequently, gains\r\nin life expectancy have been seriously eroded. The\r\nmajority of young people in the 15 to 24 age range are\r\nthe most highly infected, with more negative\r\nimplications for girls than boys.\r\nSADC’s response to the pandemic, which is\r\ncontained in the SADC HIV/AIDS Strategic\r\nFramework and Programme of Action for 2002 to\r\n2004, addresses a number of key areas, including\r\nleadership, partnership and resources. SADC believes\r\nthat strong political leadership is a central feature if\r\ncountries are to succeed in their response to the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. The leadership in our countries\r\nhas been, and continues to be, forthcoming and actively\r\ninvolved in mobilizing nations to combat this scourge.\r\nBoth the SADC Summit and the Council of Ministers\r\nare actively involved in seeking solutions to the\r\npandemic. Initiatives currently being pursued include\r\nthe questions of mother-to-child transmission of\r\nHIV/AIDS and the availability of antiretroviral drugs;\r\nstepping up efforts to implement programmes in\r\nmember States aimed at supporting voluntary\r\ncounselling and testing; and coordinating action by\r\nscientists in the speedy development of effective and\r\naffordable vaccines. Strengthening the capacities of\r\nhealth systems to effectively deliver services poses a\r\nserious challenge that requires urgent attention.\r\nIn line with the observation of the Executive\r\nDirector of UNAIDS at the briefing given to Member\r\nStates at this session, there is an urgent need to engage\r\nother sectors. Among other things, the SADC\r\nFramework proposes to involve the 10 economic\r\nsectors within SADC, namely, those of culture,\r\ninformation and sports; employment and labour; health;\r\nhuman resources development; mining; tourism; the\r\ntransport and communications commission; industry\r\nand trade; finance; and food, agriculture and natural\r\nresources. The SADC Gender Unit is also a critical\r\nactor in the response, considering the disproportionate\r\nimpact of the pandemic on the vulnerability of women\r\nand girls.\r\nThose sectors indeed have a critical role to play\r\nin the implementation of the Framework. For example,\r\nthe employment and labour sector adopted a reporting\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nformat on HIV/AIDS and employment in order to\r\neffectively monitor the code of conduct on HIV/AIDS\r\nand employment in the SADC region. Furthermore, the\r\nfinance and investment sector established a working\r\ngroup on HIV/AIDS to look into creating an\r\ninformation centre where all research and analysis on\r\nthe economic, financing and costing of alternative\r\nHIV/AIDS-related policies from the SADC region will\r\nbe collected.\r\nPartnership with the private sector, civil society\r\nand the donor community is an area in which there\r\nhave been positive results in the fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. The SADC Health Sector Coordination\r\nUnit established collaborative links with the Southern\r\nAfrican Network of AIDS Service Organizations,\r\nwhich is a part of a worldwide grouping of AIDS\r\nservice organizations in Africa. Collaborative\r\npartnership was also established with the United\r\nNations Economic Commission for Africa and the\r\nSubregional Development Centre for Southern Africa\r\nin Lusaka, which has further strengthened SADC’s\r\nresponse to HIV/AIDS by incorporating the gender\r\nprospective as part of an ongoing process.\r\nThe problem of HIV/AIDS orphans is also on the\r\nrise in the SADC region, owing to escalating mortality\r\namong HIV/AIDS parents. Civil society, faith-based\r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations are\r\nencouraged to participate in dealing with the challenge\r\nof orphans. This is an area where new strategies must\r\nbe established in order to secure a brighter future for\r\norphans. In this connection, a SADC workshop on\r\norphans and vulnerable children will be held in\r\nWindhoek, Namibia, from 25 to 30 November 2002.\r\nSADC commends the United Nations Children’s Fund,\r\nthe World Health Organization and other United\r\nNations agencies and non-governmental organizations\r\nfor their increased support to orphan-care programmes\r\nin the SADC region.\r\nThe provision of care, support and treatment to\r\nHIV/AIDS patients remains an expensive exercise, due\r\nmainly to the high cost of drugs. SADC countries are\r\ndeveloping countries, which have numerous economic\r\nand social development constraints. The additional\r\nhigh cost of drugs adds to the already existing financial\r\ndifficulties faced by our countries. In that regard,\r\nSADC wishes to support the Secretary-General’s call\r\non all Member States to strengthen their intervention\r\nefforts through, among other measures, enhanced\r\naccess to HIV treatment, such as antiretroviral drugs,\r\nwhich need to be made available to HIV/AIDS patients\r\nat affordable cost.\r\nSADC is convinced that the Global Fund to fight\r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria can provide\r\nsubstantial financial support in implementing the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment. We would like to thank\r\nUNAIDS for expressing its willingness to provide\r\ntechnical support to requesting Member States, which\r\nwill be valuable for SADC members in working\r\ntowards the realization of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment. We are also thankful to all the donors\r\nwho have generously contributed to the Fund. We hope\r\nthat the Fund will be provided with adequate resources\r\nto make it sustainable.\r\nIn conclusion, SADC commends UNAIDS and its\r\neight sponsors for their untiring efforts in assisting our\r\nGovernments to translate the Declaration of\r\nCommitment into concrete actions. Indeed, a lot of\r\nwork remains to be done if we are to realize the goals\r\nof the Declaration of Commitment. We call for\r\ncontinued international technical and financial support\r\nfor all the efforts designed to address the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic and its related problems, without which all\r\nthe efforts to eliminate the vulnerability of the human\r\nrace to HIV/AIDS will continue to pose serious threats\r\nto the world at large.\r\nMrs. Loemban Tobing-Klein (Suriname):\r\nFifteen years ago, the most serious disease we all\r\nfeared was cancer. Diseases such as leprosy, small pox\r\nand several childhood diseases could be cured. Nobody\r\nwould have thought that there could be diseases as\r\ndangerous as HIV/AIDS. Nobody would have thought\r\nthat, in a world where science is at its peak, a cure\r\nwould have been so difficult to find or medicines so\r\nexpensive and hard to obtain.\r\nIn the late 1980s, the first HIV/AIDS deaths were\r\nrecorded in Suriname. People were afraid even to\r\nmention the name of the disease. Today Suriname is no\r\ndifferent from other countries, where too many of our\r\nyoung, energetic people are infected or affected by\r\nHIV/AIDS. Around 1990, the Government and civil\r\nsociety started planning how to react and how to\r\nprotect our people from HIV/AIDS. A strategy was set\r\nout leading to the creation of a national AIDS\r\nprogramme, instituted within the Ministry of Health,\r\nand the Mamio Namen Project — the Quilt Names\r\nProject — a non-governmental organization (NGO)\r\nwhose main objective is to make HIV/AIDS awareness\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nan ongoing concern by making quilts for every person\r\nwho has died of AIDS. Making the quilts together also\r\nsupports families in their efforts to cope with their\r\ngrief. Various kinds of support are given, including\r\nfinancial assistance, medicine, food and social support\r\nfrom friends.\r\nOther initiatives include the Peer Education\r\nProgramme Suriname, an NGO led by youngsters who\r\nelaborate awareness programs to reach youth in and out\r\nof schools; the Maxi Linder Foundation, which focuses\r\non commercial sex workers and their families; and the\r\nClaudia A. Foundation, which works especially in low-\r\nincome neighbourhoods, supporting HIV/AIDS\r\ninfected and affected peoples in various ways. One of\r\ntheir activities is distributing daily hot meals to\r\nfamilies with limited or no financial means. In this\r\nendeavour, they are subsidized by the Ministry of\r\nSocial Affairs and Housing. There are also\r\narrangements made to make individuals eligible for\r\nvarious types of social support from the Government,\r\nincluding housing, financial assistance and medical\r\ncare.\r\nThe newest foundation is Parel, meaning “pearl”,\r\nwhich takes care of AIDS orphans by providing them\r\nwith a home and all necessary support if no one takes\r\nresponsibility for them. In this regard, grandmothers\r\nare playing a pivotal role, as is true internationally,\r\nsince more than 20 million people of the 60 million\r\nHIV/AIDS infected persons have already died, leaving\r\nbehind millions of orphans.\r\nApart from the NGOs in Suriname, governmental\r\nand non-governmental health organizations carry out\r\nprogrammes on HIV/AIDS infected and affected\r\npeoples, within their regular programmes. The national\r\nfamily planning NGO, Stichting Lobi, a lobby\r\nfoundation also called the “the love foundation”, has\r\ngained several regional and international awards for\r\ntheir family planning activities, including HIV/AIDS\r\nawareness. Special attention is given to young boys in\r\npoor sections of the capital, who are encouraged to\r\nlisten and to talk about HIV/AIDS and how to protect\r\nthemselves.\r\nThe national AIDS programme with a\r\nGovernment-appointed coordinator is carrying out a\r\nproject to enact legislation to give HIV/AIDS the status\r\nof a sexually transmitted disease. That will establish a\r\nlegal basis for testing partners of AIDS-infected\r\npersons in order to prosecute people who have\r\ndeliberately infected others with the virus. The new\r\nlegislation will also compel employers to keep their\r\ninfected employees at their jobs. People who\r\ndiscriminate against HIV/AIDS infected or affected\r\npeople will be prosecuted.\r\nIn the last few years, insurance companies and\r\nprivate companies have joined the Government and\r\nNGOs in their AIDS prevention and treatment\r\nactivities. A fund has been set up to sponsor medicine.\r\nSince the drugs are so expensive until now, just a small\r\ngroup of people were able to benefit from them. Private\r\ncompanies and interested people are encouraged to\r\ncontribute to the fund. National and international\r\nresearch institutes have shown interest in the medicinal\r\nplants of Suriname in their search for a cure for\r\nHIV/AIDS. Partnerships have been established\r\nbetween international pharmaceutical companies such\r\nas Bristol-Myers Squibb, the Government of Suriname,\r\nthe University of Suriname, some nature conservation\r\nNGOs and tribal communities. In the context of the\r\nCaribbean Community, of which Suriname is a\r\nmember, our country is participating in the project of\r\nthe Council for Human and Social Development to\r\ncombat the growing incidence of HIV/AIDS and to\r\npromote HIV/AIDS awareness training. The Caribbean\r\nis the most infected region after sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, may I join all other delegates in\r\napplauding the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report on the implementation of the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at\r\nthe General Assembly’s twenty-sixth special session.\r\nThe Government of Suriname participated actively in\r\nthe special session on HIV/AIDS in June 2002, with a\r\ndelegation chaired by the Ministry of Health, and\r\nconsisting also of NGO representation.\r\nWe also wish to commend various countries, such\r\nas Japan and the United States, for their valuable\r\nsupport for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which needs more\r\nresources — as we have heard here — than what have\r\nso far been made available. My country Suriname has\r\nfiled a project proposal in the month of September,\r\nbefore the deadline, and hopes to be among the\r\ncountries selected for the project.\r\nThe President: In accordance with General\r\nAssembly resolution 49/2 of 19 October 1994, I now\r\ncall on the Observer for the International Federation of\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\nMr. Gospodinov (International Federation of Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): At the end of a long\r\nday, please allow me to read a shorter version of my\r\nstatement.\r\nThis is one of the discussions which makes us all\r\nfeel both uncomfortable and concerned.\r\nUncomfortable, because despite all our efforts, the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic is conquering new territories.\r\nConcerned, because people are being infected and are\r\ndying with a speed faster than the effect of our efforts.\r\nYet, almost a year and a half after the Declaration\r\nof Commitment was adopted, the International Red\r\nCross and Red Crescent Movement has something\r\nencouraging to announce. In the over 50 countries hit\r\nhardest by the AIDS epidemic, the Red Cross or Red\r\nCrescent Societies launched new HIV/AIDS\r\nprogrammes, scaled up existing ones and incorporated\r\nHIV/AIDS components into already existing health\r\nactivities.\r\nTo all of you that supported and recognized the\r\nrole of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in combating\r\nHIV/AIDS, I want to tell you today that pockets of\r\nsuccess can be seen in many places where we work.\r\nFor example, the Red Cross of Uganda has been\r\npromoting blood safety in partnership with the Blood\r\nTransfusion Service. Fifty per cent of the blood\r\ncollected is used to treat infant and child anaemia as a\r\nresult of malaria. Each unit of blood services 3\r\nchildren. Last year alone, some 86,000 units of HIV-\r\nfree blood were collected, assisting approximately\r\n129,000 children. This amount of blood has risen\r\nsteadily from 7,000 units in 1990 to 70,000 units in\r\n2000. The target for this year is 100,000 units.\r\nIn Southern Africa, the Red Cross is targeting\r\npeer education for youth. In Botswana alone, some 480\r\npeer educators have been trained this year to\r\ndisseminate information regarding protection against\r\nHIV/AIDS. Trainings have been undertaken in South\r\nAfrica, Malawi, Togo, Lesotho and other countries.\r\nIn response to the developing food crisis in\r\nSouthern Africa, where the combination of drought,\r\nHIV/AIDS and other factors make the picture\r\ncatastrophic, the IFRC launched an appeal for $61.6\r\nmillion to assist a minimum of 1.3 million people. Red\r\nCross assistance is targeted to households made\r\nvulnerable by HIV/AIDS, with a focus on children,\r\nwomen and the elderly.\r\nOur efforts in this region were firmly supported\r\nby the Norwegian Government, which provided over\r\n200 heavy duty trucks for our joint effort with the\r\nWorld Food Programme to deliver 1 million metric\r\ntons of food to 10.2 million people in six countries.\r\nFurthermore, the Governments of the Netherlands and\r\nSweden recently made the largest single donation —\r\n$14 million — to a Red Cross/Red Crescent\r\nProgramme, outside of the emergency relief operation,\r\nto guarantee long term support for people living with\r\nHIV/AIDS. IFRC programmes will be boosted in\r\nAngola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,\r\nNamibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and\r\nZimbabwe, where millions of people suffer from the\r\ncombined effect of the food crisis and the pandemic.\r\nSimilar programmes are being undertaken in Eastern\r\nEurope and Central Asia.\r\nConcerning China, we are proud of what United\r\nNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said a few\r\nweeks ago during his speech at Hangzhou University,\r\nwhere he praised the work of the Chinese Red Cross\r\nyouth peer education in Yunnan as a successful model\r\nof HIV prevention in this huge country.\r\nSkills development trainings have taken place for\r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies from the Middle\r\nEast and North Africa, where concrete programmes are\r\nbeing structured. The Iranian Red Crescent branch in\r\nKermanshah Province conducted programmes which\r\nhave benefited 6,400 people last year alone.\r\nThere are many more examples of the work we\r\ndo. But being realists, we see how much more is to be\r\ndone. And we know that acting alone will not solve the\r\nproblem. In implementing the Declaration of\r\nCommitment, and as a contribution to the objective set\r\nby the United Nations General Assembly Special\r\nSession, the IFRC has launched the global campaign\r\ncalled THE TRUTH ABOUT AIDS: PASS IT ON. We\r\ndid this jointly with the Global Network of People\r\nLiving with HIV/AIDS, with the Joint United Nations\r\nProgramme on AIDS and Saatchi \u0026 Saatchi. It is a\r\nlong term effort to prevent, reduce and ultimately\r\neliminate HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination\r\nagainst those who suffer from the disease wherever it\r\noccurs and in all its forms.\r\nAs the only representative of civil society in this\r\nroom today, we value the power of partnerships\r\nbetween neighbouring countries, such as between the\r\nRed Cross of Laos and Thailand. They will lead to\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.49\r\ncrossing geographical and psychological borders and\r\nhelp people who may feel isolated or forgotten.\r\nThe corporate sector also joins us. Giants such as\r\nNestle and Unilever are the two that provide over 1\r\nmillion Swiss francs a year, and OPEC International\r\nFund has just joined in with $4 million for Red Cross\r\nand Red Crescent programmes in Asia.\r\nIt is also significant to note that just a few days\r\nago, the IFRC Governing Board approved the new\r\nHIV/AIDS Policy for the entire Red Cross and Red\r\nCrescent Movement. In this document the IFRC paves\r\nthe way for engagement of our National Red Cross and\r\nRed Crescent Societies in a number of areas that were\r\nnot specifically targeted in our previous work.\r\nWe believe that with committed leadership at the\r\ntop, and motivated volunteers in the field, we can make\r\na difference.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on Agenda item 42. The\r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its\r\nconsideration of Agenda item 42.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nMr. Mamba (Swaziland), Vice-President, in the\r\nChair.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill consider the reports of the Sixth Committee on the\r\nmorning of Tuesday, 19 November 2002. The General\r\nAssembly will consider the reports of the First\r\nCommittee on the morning of Friday, 22 November.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6:20 p.m.\r\n"
