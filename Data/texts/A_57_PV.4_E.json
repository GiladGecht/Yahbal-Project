"United Nations A/57/PV.4\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nFifty-seventh session\r\n4th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 13 September 2002, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-178. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n02-58836 (E)\r\n*0258836*\r\nPresident: Mr. Kavan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 119 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the\r\nexpenses of the United Nations (A/57/390/Add.1)\r\nThe President: I should like to draw the attention\r\nof the General Assembly to document A/57/390/Add.1.\r\nIn a letter contained in that document, the\r\nSecretary-General informs the President of the General\r\nAssembly that, since the issuance of his\r\ncommunication contained in document A/57/390,\r\nMauritania has made the necessary payment to reduce\r\nits arrears below the amount specified in Article 19 of\r\nthe Charter.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly duly\r\ntakes note of the information contained in this\r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAddress by Mr. Milan Kučan, President of the\r\nRepublic of Slovenia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Milan Kučan, President of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Milan Kučan, President of\r\nthe Republic of Slovenia, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Kučan (spoke in Slovenian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): It was 10 years ago,\r\nimmediately following the admission of newborn\r\nSlovenia to the United Nations, that I addressed the\r\nAssembly for the first time. I did so with great pride,\r\nwith faith in the United Nations and with gratitude for\r\nthe chance given to my country to present to the\r\ninternational community its own views on current\r\nworld affairs, with a sense of responsibility for its\r\nactions not only towards its own citizens, but also\r\ntowards the entire international democratic community.\r\nLooking back at the past decade, I can say\r\nwithout the slightest reservation that, without the\r\nUnited Nations, life on our planet would be even more\r\nuncertain, social injustice would be even more\r\nwidespread and global disparities in prosperity even\r\nmore marked. There would be even more systematic\r\nviolations of human rights in many States and even\r\nmore wars.\r\nIn spite of its acknowledged weaknesses and\r\ninefficiencies, this world Organization has done great\r\nwork. I daresay that, throughout its membership,\r\nSlovenia, too, has contributed to this through its own\r\nactive pursuit of the principles of the United Nations. It\r\nreceived widespread recognition for the work it\r\naccomplished as a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council; this is something of which we are\r\nparticularly proud.\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nThe United Nations decisions at the historic\r\nMillennium Summit have already placed the\r\nOrganization in the future realm of our global world.\r\nThe violence committed by States against their own\r\npeoples is now faced with a new force: the ethic of the\r\ndemocratic world. This ethic does not recognize\r\nabsolute State sovereignty or absolute non-interference\r\nin internal affairs when systematic mass violations of\r\nhuman rights, through State terror, occur.\r\nThe principle of humanitarian intervention is the\r\nbeginning of an important process of implementing\r\nglobal ethics in the governance of this globalized and\r\nincreasingly interdependent world. It is also a clear\r\nmessage to the authors of international law and to\r\ninternational judicial institutions. It is one of the pillars\r\nof the next phase of international law, as is the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. No one any longer has\r\nresponsibility only towards themselves. State\r\nsovereignty is no longer untouchable. Everyone, in\r\ntheir actions, also has a responsibility towards global\r\nsociety, for in an increasingly integrated world, the\r\nactions of one easily affect others.\r\nCertain measures of the global community of\r\nStates in response to the challenges of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, such as the special session on the future of\r\nchildren, the World Summit Sustainable Development\r\nand the forthcoming meetings on a better future for\r\nAfrica are signs that the United Nations is gaining in\r\npolitical and moral clout as an Organization common to\r\nall States and as an organization capable of finding the\r\nstrength to carry out the announced internal reforms.\r\nIn that context, Slovenia supports the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration and the\r\nSecretary-Generals proposed reforms. That these\r\nefforts are urgently needed became particularly\r\napparent last year on 11 September, a day of tragedy\r\nnot only for New York, Washington and the United\r\nStates in general, but for all humanity. The entire\r\ndemocratic world joined in the fight against\r\ninternational terrorism. Slovenia also did so with great\r\nresolve. No one who cared for humanity just stood\r\naside.\r\nBut as time passed, it became increasingly clear\r\nthat even the best military weaponry of the anti-\r\nterrorist coalition could not reach down to the social\r\nroots of this horrendous evil. This evil is craftily taking\r\nadvantage of the apathy and the anger of people and\r\nStates without a future. This evil is trying to regain its\r\nstrength by playing on religious, cultural and\r\ncivilizational differences, intertwined with the great\r\nsocial rifts in our global world. Evil, understood in this\r\nway  an evil that threatens to use the most atrocious\r\nweapons of mass destruction  can be eradicated only\r\nthrough concerted action by democratic States under\r\nthe umbrella of the United Nations.\r\nIt is precisely in this context that the authority\r\nand credibility of the United Nations are on trial. The\r\nOrganization has proven itself capable of reaching\r\ncommon positions and decisions even on the most\r\ndemanding issues. We are capable of defining common\r\npositions, even concerning the actions of those who do\r\nnot respect these common decisions. The United\r\nNations now must have the ability not only to speak of\r\nthose positions, but also to implement them through\r\nconcerted action. That is the responsibility that all of us\r\nface today.\r\nGlobalization, with all of its positive and negative\r\naspects, is a given fact. Let us do more to transform\r\nthat fact into something that is in keeping with the\r\nneeds of the people and the rule of individual and\r\ncollective human rights. Certainly, this cannot be\r\nachieved by trying to drive peoples, States, cultures,\r\nreligions and civilizations away from their own\r\nidentities, by trying to place them under the common\r\ndenominator of a single global identity. That would\r\nsignify the collapse of our human world, bearing\r\ndisastrous consequences. Todays world, where borders\r\nbetween States  and particularly between\r\ncivilizations  are growing less rigid, is a world full of\r\nplural identities and of clearly defined national,\r\ncultural and religious entities that are beginning to\r\nopen up to one another.\r\nThis plurality calls for a unique integrating factor.\r\nThat factor can only be a global ethic based on the\r\nancient principle of reciprocity among human beings:\r\ndo unto others as you would have others do unto you.\r\nIn times of interdependence among each and every one\r\nof us, such values are particularly important. The\r\nglobal ethic should be developed based on this value,\r\nfor it is a value with deep roots in the worlds age-old\r\ngreat religions and civilizations. Based on this value,\r\nwe will be able to strengthen universal human rights\r\nand global social justice, and without that justice, one\r\ncannot expect the world to be a safe and peaceful place\r\noffering people justified hope that our planet belongs to\r\nall of humanity.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nInternational terrorism has unveiled the negative\r\naspects of interdependence among our societies. We\r\nmust now do more to strengthen the positive aspects\r\nand to create new ones. The environmental, economic\r\nand ethical challenges humanity is facing today require\r\na radical rethinking of global governance and the\r\nestablishment of global responsibility. This is so much\r\nmore so since we are faced with the breakdown of\r\nregulation and control in global trade, with an\r\ninequitable global development machinery that\r\ngenerates misery and humiliation, and that manifests a\r\nrelentless preference for economic and financial logic\r\nover ecological, social and human demands. A positive\r\nalternative must be found to these negative aspects of\r\nour interdependence.\r\nPresent generations of statesmen, politicians,\r\nacademicians and civil society all have a duty to lay the\r\nfoundations of a global ethic and a United Nations that\r\noffers stronger guarantees for a world that is no longer\r\nso fiercely divided into peoples, nations and States\r\nwith the right to a future and those who are robbed of\r\nthat future by the technological and social gaps of our\r\nplanet.\r\nI am convinced that there will be a kinder future\r\nfor our world and a more creative future for the United\r\nNations. It is with this in mind that I most warmly\r\nwelcome our new Member, Switzerland, and soon also,\r\nTimor-Leste. These two new Members illustrate very\r\nclearly all the disparities in our globalized world. I\r\nfirmly believe that their work in this Assembly will\r\nhelp transform the United Nations into a community\r\nfor the entire world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Slovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Milan Kučan, President of the Republic of\r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of\r\nthe Republic of Ghana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Agyekum Kufuor,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kufuor: A year ago the entire world\r\nwatched in horror as terror was visited on the city that\r\nplays host to the United Nations. It is a city that has\r\nwelcomed people from all corners of the world for\r\nhundreds of years and that still remains for many an\r\nirresistible magnet as a place of opportunity.\r\nWe watched  all of us, from our different parts\r\nof the world  as the terrible events unfolded. If there\r\nhad been any doubt before, that experience convinced\r\nall of us that our world had indeed become a global\r\nvillage. Modern technology enabled all of us\r\nsimultaneously to watch the events as they unfolded.\r\nThe devastation and drama of those events have since\r\nforcefully brought grief to our individual hearts, across\r\ncontinents, races, religions and political ideologies. If\r\never there was any doubt about mankinds shared\r\nhumanity, that catastrophe conclusively dispelled it.\r\nA year on, we still bear the deep scars; we have\r\nnot forgotten, and we dare not forget, because what\r\nhappened was not directed exclusively against New\r\nYork and the people of the United States. Nationals of\r\nmany countries, including Ghanaians, perished in that\r\ntragedy. What happened was indeed an affront to\r\ncivilization itself.\r\nThroughout the ages, whenever humanity has\r\nfound itself confronted with great danger, it is the sense\r\nof unity and common purpose that has pulled us\r\nthrough. This is no exception. Indeed, the resilience of\r\nNew York and of the people of the United States has\r\nbrought about a spirit of solidarity and generosity that\r\nis just as awesome to behold as the tragic event itself.\r\nIt is for that reason that I am optimistic about the\r\nfuture. The work of the United Nations and of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, and the growing\r\nacceptance of the principles of good governance,\r\nhuman rights, tolerance for a diversity of views and the\r\nrule of law around the globe make me optimistic. In my\r\nminds eye, I can already see, in the near future, a\r\nworld in which there is more openness, more\r\nforbearance and less categorization of mankind.\r\nOur nations have been brought together by\r\nscience, technology and conscience, as well as by\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nadversity, and the acknowledgement of\r\ninterdependence among peoples has become a reality.\r\nNow we are moving from the concept of beggar thy\r\nneighbour to one of prosper thy neighbour, which\r\nshould become the hallmark of the global village.\r\nSadly, the continent of Africa still lags behind in\r\nmany spheres, as poverty and disease plague the\r\ncontinent. But there is a new spirit abroad among the\r\nAfrican countries. Africa has never wanted to be\r\nperceived as the scar on the conscience of the world.\r\nWe do not want to be the object of pity and charity, and\r\nwe do not want to provide the grisly images of war,\r\ndisease, ignorance, famine and poverty for the worlds\r\ntelevision screens. It was largely as a result of our\r\ndetermination to shed that unacceptable image that\r\nmany a country on the continent, on attaining\r\nindependence, desperately rushed into one or another\r\nuntried ideology or economic model that tended only to\r\nworsen the woes of self-doubt left by exploitative and\r\nunconscionable colonialism.\r\nToday, under the auspices of the African Union,\r\nthe rejuvenated continental grouping, our countries\r\nhave resolved to tackle the continents problems to\r\nenable us join the mainstream of world development.\r\nWe have pledged to endeavour to be honest with each\r\nother, and under the Peer Review Mechanism there will\r\nbe no hiding behind claims of sovereignty in order to\r\ntolerate abuses of human rights in individual countries.\r\nWe are determined to strive for democracy and\r\ngood governance, not because those are fashionable\r\nbuzzwords but because we are convinced that they are\r\nthe surest  if not always the most rapid  path to the\r\ndevelopment that we require to uplift the conditions of\r\nlife of our peoples.\r\nThe technology exists and the human expertise\r\nabounds in the world to end the degrading poverty and\r\ndebilitating diseases that sap the confidence of the\r\npeoples of Africa. This world Assembly must rally to\r\nhelp Africa in its genuine efforts to tap into the\r\nintellectual, financial and moral resources of the globe,\r\nto be a worthy partner within it. The concept of the\r\nNew Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD)\r\nprovides the framework within which African countries\r\ncan be assisted to become part of the mainstream. It\r\nprovides a great opportunity for world leaders to move\r\nfrom rhetoric to purposeful action.\r\nEducation has served as a route out of poverty for\r\npeople throughout the ages, and it should be the way\r\nout for us in Africa as well. We have an essentially\r\nyoung population that is ready and anxious to learn.\r\nFortunately, information and communications\r\ntechnology provides the means to help Africa leap-frog\r\ninto the modern world. Let the world community\r\ntherefore assist Africa to join in the mastery of this\r\npowerful tool.\r\nOurs is a well-endowed continent. Our raw\r\nmaterials keep the manufacturing engines of the world\r\nrunning. The reasons for investing in Africa, therefore,\r\nneed not be charitable; investment can be based on\r\nsound economic considerations. The market potential\r\nof a thriving and economically viable Africa will do\r\nwonders not only for Africa but also for the world\r\neconomy at large.\r\nI am optimistic, because I think of what Ghana\r\nand the African continent have contributed to the\r\ndevelopment of the world. We have provided, and\r\ncontinue to provide, personnel in various fields to all\r\nkinds of institutions in the world. Ghanaian academics\r\nand citizens from many other African countries can be\r\nfound in many top universities and companies around\r\nthe world, contributing significantly to the\r\ndevelopment of cutting-edge enterprises. Africans are\r\nin various jobs and are making a considerable\r\ncontribution to the running of organizations, including\r\nthe United Nations. I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express Ghanas  and Africas \r\ndeepest gratitude to the international community for\r\nthe confidence it showed in re-electing Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, the Secretary-General, to a second term.\r\nIn all these endeavours, however, the missing link\r\nfor Africa has been the solid and sustainable\r\nframework for good governance to support the\r\npurposeful evolution of prosperous and stable nations\r\non the continent. It is for this reason that Ghana, like\r\nother African nations, is trying to put its house in order\r\nto take advantage of emerging prospects. We are\r\nnurturing our infant democracy, and the citizens are\r\npassionately committed to the defence of the\r\nConstitution. We are putting in place mechanisms to\r\nsupport good governance. The institutional framework\r\nis being created to ensure an efficient public sector that\r\ncan interface effectively with an enterprising private\r\nsector to create wealth and eliminate poverty.\r\nBut Ghana, like other developing countries,\r\ncannot alone achieve the dramatic rate of growth that is\r\nrequired; there must be significant injections of outside\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\ninvestment into our economy. We need affordable and\r\nsustainable sources of energy to be able to achieve\r\nrapid development. We need the partnership, markets\r\nand support of the international community to sustain\r\nour development. That is the message of NEPAD. We\r\nare working to develop a positive economic\r\nenvironment to receive and integrate foreign direct\r\ninvestment as a tool for regional development. That is\r\nthe sure path for Africa to connect effectively with the\r\nglobal markets.\r\nGhana acknowledges its share of responsibility to\r\nprotect the resources that Nature has given our country\r\nas the heritage of all humankind. The world cannot and\r\nmust not operate on the basis of the survival of the\r\nfittest. Weaknesses caused by history and other factors\r\nmust be taken into account and, above all, our common\r\nhumanity must inform all our international dealings.\r\nGhana sees a lot of potential in globalization. We\r\nwish to recommend, however, that an organization such\r\nas the United Nations should provide the regulatory\r\nframework to ensure that the benefits of globalization\r\nare more equitably distributed. The opportunities are\r\nenormous for those who can take advantage of the\r\nmove to more liberalized markets and increased flows\r\nof investment capital. But nature did not make all\r\npeople equally competitive. That global organization\r\nmust, therefore, evolve systems of safety nets to\r\nguarantee all humanity an acceptable minimum degree\r\nof dignity and respectability. The United Nations must\r\nrise up to this challenge.\r\nFor the pure and proper development of the\r\nglobal village, certain initiatives by this Organization\r\nmust be commended and encouraged. Ghana is in full\r\nsupport of United Nations effort to curb the illicit trade\r\nin small arms and light weapons. We urge Member\r\nStates to join in the early implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action that was adopted in 2001 to stop\r\nthis trade, from which most of the instability in Africa\r\nstems.\r\nSecondly, women and children need our\r\nprotection. It is for that very reason that in Ghana we\r\nhave created a Ministry for Women and Childrens\r\nAffairs to enable us tackle issues that affect those two\r\ngroups. We have embarked on a vibrant educational\r\ncampaign and are pursuing policy initiatives that will\r\ncreate awareness and reduce the incidence of\r\ndiscrimination against women and help improve their\r\nlivelihoods. We are also striving to ban child labour\r\nand enforce free and compulsory education for all\r\nchildren up to the junior secondary school level as\r\nenjoined by Ghanas national Constitution.\r\nThirdly, I must mention the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\r\nwhich is threatening the survival of our countries. The\r\nspread of the disease is compounding our difficulties\r\neven further. I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his interest, and for the setting up of the\r\nGlobal Fund to help us fight the menace. The Ghana\r\nAIDS Commission is constantly seeking new ways to\r\nchange attitudes at all levels towards the disease, and\r\nwe seek to learn from the experience of others in\r\ncombating it. We support the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity to provide more affordable antiretroviral\r\ndrugs for the most needy.\r\nAt this stage, permit me to congratulate\r\nSwitzerland on its accession to membership, and East\r\nTimor on its forthcoming accession. That Switzerland\r\nhas at long last joined the Organization confirms its\r\nuniversality. They are welcome.\r\nThe tragedy of 11 September has certainly made a\r\ndifference to the world. It has shocked the world into\r\nuniting to condemn it. Let those of us who have\r\naccepted the honour and privilege to speak on behalf of\r\nour peoples determine that we must strive for a world\r\nof greater tolerance and of more justice, a more\r\nhumane world in which law and order are fully\r\nrespected both within nations and in the international\r\ncommunity. Eleven September must be used to\r\nunderpin the vital communal spirit that must motivate\r\nthe global village. We would then be able to say that\r\nwe had left the world a better place than we found it.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Ghana for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. John Agyekum Kufuor, President of the\r\nRepublic of Ghana was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pierre Buyoya, President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Burundi.\r\nMr. Pierre Buyoya, President of the Republic of\r\nBurundi was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Pierre Buyoya, President\r\nof the Republic of Burundi, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Buyoya (spoke in French): It is an\r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-seventh session. Let me first of all, Sir, discharge\r\na pleasant duty on behalf of my delegation and on my\r\nown account, and extend to you my warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. You may rest\r\nassured of the support and cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Burundi towards the success of your\r\ndifficult and important mission. I also pay tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\nfor the able manner in which he led the work of the\r\nfifty-sixth session.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to take this opportunity\r\nto express our gratitude to the United Nations, and to\r\npay tribute to its Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nfor his support to the people of Burundi.\r\nNor can I fail to thank the Security Council for its\r\ntireless efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis in\r\nBurundi. Through its two visits to Burundi, the latest\r\non 5 and 6 May 2002, the Security Council has shown\r\nits solidarity with the people of Burundi in its quest for\r\npeace.\r\nDuring my address, I shall inform the Assembly\r\nof the political situation in Burundi, and of how far we\r\nhave come in the peace process; I will then go on to\r\nspeak of the challenges we still face and will conclude\r\nmy statement with some comments on international\r\nissues.\r\nFollowing the establishment of transitional\r\ninstitutions beginning 1 November 2001, the political\r\nclimate in Burundi has greatly improved. The political\r\nforces that had taken part in the Arusha negotiations\r\nand signed the Peace Agreement now form the\r\ninstitutions of the Republic: the Government, the\r\nNational Assembly and the transitional Senate.\r\nAdvocating dialogue in an armed conflict is not\r\nalways an easy task, but a sense of responsibility gives\r\nus no alternative. We are pleased to recall from this\r\nrostrum that we have chosen the option of peace\r\nthrough dialogue and the procrastinations of others\r\ninvolved in no way shake our conviction.\r\nSince we are on the right path, we request the\r\nSecretary-General, the Security Council, the African\r\nUnion and the countries of our subregion to maintain\r\ntheir support for our quest for peace by assisting the\r\nmediation activities  led by Nelson Mandela, assisted\r\nby Presidents El Hadj Omar Bongo and Benjamin\r\nMkapa and Vice-President Jacob Zuma  in order to\r\npersuade the protagonists to sign a ceasefire agreement\r\nwithout further delay. Indeed, certain provisions of the\r\nArusha Agreement are not being applied precisely\r\nbecause of the ongoing violence. That is why the\r\nnegotiation and signing of a ceasefire is a crucial stage\r\nin hastening and ensuring the success of the many\r\nreforms to be undertaken.\r\nThe task ahead is enormous, but it can be\r\naccomplished. The smooth functioning of institutions is\r\na guarantee of success, while daily experience\r\ndemonstrates the serious commitment of the political\r\npartners and is the basis of our optimism.\r\nWhile it is true that there are reasons for hope, it\r\nis equally true that the challenges to the peace process\r\nare genuine and could compromise our path to peace if\r\nthey are not satisfactorily met in the short term. The\r\nviolence which the rebels continue to force on the\r\nBurundian people is a major challenge not only to us,\r\nbut to the United Nations, whose primary mission is to\r\nmaintain peace throughout the world.\r\nWe take this solemn opportunity to reiterate our\r\nrequest to the entire international community to compel\r\nthe Burundian rebels to renounce violence. If\r\ndiplomacy does not succeed, all other means must be\r\nused in order to prevent this rebellion from taking\r\nhostage a peace process being led today by a\r\nGovernment formed on the basis of negotiations and\r\nwhich now enjoys international legitimacy. Peace will\r\ncome to the Great Lakes region when every country\r\nthere is living in peace. To that end, the effort must be\r\nboth individual and collective. That is why my country\r\nis prepared to continue making its contribution to\r\ncreating a better climate with all neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nThe second major challenge is the reconstruction\r\neffort. After nine years of crisis, the Burundian\r\neconomy has been sorely tried. The population has\r\nbecome further impoverished, all economic parameters\r\nhave been destabilized, and our external indebtedness\r\nprevents us from resorting, as we have done in the past,\r\nto the international financial marketplace. Here again,\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nwe ask our traditional partners to give substantial\r\nsupport to our peace efforts. Promises have been made\r\nthat we hope will be kept in the near future. Indeed, the\r\nrepatriation of refugees, the resettlement of displaced\r\npersons and the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure\r\nwill require substantial financial resources.\r\nAs members of the human community,\r\nBurundians are also following the concerns of the\r\nworld, which, sadly, are many and to which we are\r\nconstantly seeking solutions. To cite but a few, Burundi\r\nwelcomes the creation of the Global Fund to Fight\r\nAIDS and, like other countries that have been deeply\r\naffected by the pandemic, has requested that access to\r\naffordable medicine be improved until such time as\r\nresearchers are able to develop a vaccine against this\r\nscourge, which threatens all humankind, especially in\r\nAfrica. In the same vein, my delegation supports the\r\nidea of creating a world fund to fight poverty and also\r\nwelcomes the proposal to establish a world fund for the\r\nenvironment.\r\nEven closer to home, our peoples await the\r\nconcrete results of the recent World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development in Johannesburg, at which\r\nthe community of nations reaffirmed the need to work\r\ntogether towards equitable and viable development for\r\ncurrent and future generations. We also welcome the\r\nestablishment of the Office of the High Representative\r\nfor the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked\r\nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing\r\nStates. This testifies to the unequivocal commitment of\r\nthe United Nations to enhancing and focusing efforts\r\non behalf of the most vulnerable groups of countries.\r\nOn the African continent, the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development is a major source of hope and, as\r\nsuch, deserves the support of the international financial\r\ninstitutions and of the community of donors.\r\nAlong with the poverty that is affecting millions\r\nof human beings, another fearful danger is that of\r\nterrorism. A year after the terrorist attacks of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 in New York, Washington, D.C., and\r\nPennsylvania, the world remains in a state of shock and\r\nis seeking ways to stem the scourge of international\r\nterrorism. To that end, Burundi is committed to\r\nimplementing the provisions of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), which provides the blueprint\r\nfor a collective fight against terrorism.\r\nThe great challenges of poverty, environmental\r\ndegradation, international terrorism, armed conflict and\r\nincurable disease require all nations, rich and poor, to\r\nrecognize international solidarity as the necessary\r\nmeans of survival for us all. The United Nations is\r\ntherefore called on to meet this challenge, especially by\r\ncarrying out the necessary reform of its organs  the\r\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the\r\nEconomic and Social Council  in order to make them\r\nmore complementary and effective in the interest of all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Burundi for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Pierre Buyoya, President of the Republic of\r\nBurundi, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the President of the Republic of\r\nColombia.\r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Uribe (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I greet\r\nyou, Your Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech\r\nRepublic, President of the General Assembly, which I\r\naddress for the first time.\r\nA short distance from here, on the fateful day 11\r\nSeptember, 2,801 citizens of the world died. In\r\nColombia, violence claims the same number of victims\r\nevery month. Forty three million Colombians, peace-\r\nloving people, are experiencing one of the worlds\r\nworst humanitarian crises. Every year Colombia buries\r\n34,000 of its own, victims of violence. We have lost 10\r\nper cent of our youth. Last year the country registered\r\nthe highest homicide rate in the world: 63 per 100,000\r\ninhabitants.\r\nDuring the past five years, we have experienced\r\n8,000 acts of collective destruction, more than those\r\nrecorded for any other cases of violence in the world;\r\n280 villages were the object of guerrilla and\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nparamilitary attacks with serious consequences for\r\nlocal civilians and the armed forces. The terrorist\r\nattack carried out during my inaugural ceremony killed\r\n21 ordinary people. Two million people, 40 per cent of\r\nthem children, have been forcibly displaced under\r\npressure from violent groups. That is the equivalent of\r\nthe simultaneous displacement of the communities of\r\nWashington and Manhattan. During the past five years,\r\n16,500 people have been kidnap victims. Yesterday, six\r\nchildren were kidnapped and one of them is still being\r\nheld.\r\nJust as the 11 September terrorist attacks moved\r\nthe entire world and triggered justified and universal\r\ncondemnation, mankind should be shaken by attacks\r\nsuch as the one carried out by guerrillas on 2 May\r\n2002, in Bojayá, a village of 1,000 inhabitants. They\r\nkilled 117 civilians who had taken refuge in the church.\r\nSuch violence makes our people poorer every\r\nday, discourages investments, hampers economic\r\ngrowth, diverts valuable resources and prevents us\r\nfrom overcoming our economic and social\r\nbackwardness. Violence absorbs four per cent of my\r\ncountrys gross domestic product. Hijackings,\r\nkidnappings and assaults are daily occurrences on our\r\nmain highways, including the one that joins our two\r\nlargest cities. Imagine a similar situation between\r\nBrussels and Paris, or New York and Boston.\r\nToday, Colombians are making a great effort to\r\naddress the problem with public order policies, State\r\nreform aimed at defeating corruption and political\r\nchicanery and greater economic growth and social\r\ninvestment. The main objective of our democratic\r\nsecurity policy is to restore the rule of law. Security is\r\nnot for persecuting real or imagined ideological\r\nenemies or maintaining a one-party regime. The aim of\r\ndemocratic security is to protect all citizens in a\r\npluralist nation, open to fraternal and creative debate.\r\nDemocratic security is for all Colombians and is\r\nintended to ensure that peasant farmers are not driven\r\nfrom their land; that members of the business\r\ncommunity are not kidnapped; that journalists are not\r\nthreatened; and that the missions of bishops, priests,\r\nnuns, preachers and educators are respected. It is also\r\nintended to ensure that union leaders can freely\r\nexercise their actions; political leaders can move about\r\nwithout fear; and that human rights advocates can work\r\nwithout threats.\r\nAs civilian commander-in-chief of the armed\r\nforces, I am committed to rigorously observing and\r\nrespecting human rights. Failure in this regard may\r\nlead to appeasement, but it would never bring\r\nreconciliation. Our emergency measures do not restrict\r\nhuman rights, but rather demand the observance of\r\nrules, for example with regard to the mobilization of\r\ncitizens, in the name of freedom of movement, to\r\nprevent explosives from continuing to be transported to\r\nassassinate people.\r\nWe respect debate. The security policy that is\r\nbeing implemented is not aimed at silencing criticism,\r\nbut rather at confronting violence. That policy is\r\nirreversible.\r\nThe number of military and police personnel in\r\nColombia is low: 3.9 per 1,000 inhabitants. New York\r\nhas 42,000 police officers, while all of Colombia has\r\n75,000. We must strengthen our armed forces. We have\r\ndecreed a wealth tax that will be paid by high-income\r\nbusinesses and citizens. The additional tax revenue\r\nshould amount approximately to 1 per cent of the gross\r\ndomestic product.\r\nAs part of the implementation of the democratic\r\nsecurity policy, our Government has called on the\r\nsolidarity of a million citizens to cooperate voluntarily\r\nwith the armed forces and justice officials. An essential\r\nelement of a socially oriented constitutional State is\r\ncitizen support for its legitimate institutions. It\r\nconstitutes the individuals commitment to the\r\ncommunity, without which the State loses its social\r\nnature. We must break citizen fear of the guerrillas and\r\nparamilitaries, and we must create community-based\r\nlinks with democratic institutions. To a large extent, the\r\nefficacy and transparency of the armed forces depend\r\non citizen cooperation.\r\nThe Colombian problem jeopardizes the\r\ndemocratic stability of the region. We need the worlds\r\nassistance to resolve it. I ask for the worlds help\r\nbecause my Government has made the decision to\r\ndefeat terror and to ensure that these four years do not\r\nend in a renewed victory for crime or in new evidence\r\nof State and societal vacillation before the arrogance of\r\nthe violent.\r\nIt is imperative that the sources of terror\r\nfinancing be eliminated. That is why we must conquer\r\ndrugs and kidnapping.\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nThere is concern about weapons of mass\r\ndestruction within the United Nations, and we share\r\nthat anguish. But we must understand that drugs have a\r\nmassive capacity for destruction, equivalent to that of\r\nthe most feared chemical weapons.\r\nWe are determined to eliminate them. We request\r\nthe same level of commitment from the world. We\r\ncannot continue with timid half-actions and decisions.\r\nMiss Clarke (Barbados), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWhile we delay action, more drugs are produced\r\nand traded by terrorism. I call on fellow members: do\r\nnot send us your weapons. Eliminate your markets for\r\ndrugs and chemical precursors. Help us with aerial\r\ninterdiction and drug seizures in the Pacific and in the\r\nCaribbean. We need resources to pay our farmers to\r\ndestroy drugs and work to restore our forests.\r\nLast week, Carlos Enrique Arenas, a 29-year-old\r\npilot serving with the Colombian navy  father of a\r\n2-year-old daughter and a second child on the way \r\nand his co-pilot, Roberto Enrique Guardo  the father\r\nof three young children  disappeared in the ocean.\r\nThe helicopter they were piloting crashed after\r\nintercepting a speedboat carrying more than two tons\r\nof cocaine. Sacrifices such as this demand the support\r\nof all nations to defeat drugs, especially since until\r\nnow we have only managed to seize 20 per cent of the\r\ndrugs that are shipped from our country.\r\nA United Nations resolution  Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001)  orders the seizure of bank\r\naccounts, investments and other assets of individuals\r\nwho commit terrorist acts. That resolution has\r\nremained a dead letter in those countries where the\r\nresources that finance terrorist acts in Colombia\r\ncirculate.\r\nMy Administrations commitment to security is\r\nnot opposed to dialogue. Quite the contrary, we want\r\ndialogue. This is why we have requested the good\r\noffices of the United Nations through a special adviser\r\nof the Secretary-General. That is the way to begin a\r\nserious peace process, one that starts with the cessation\r\nof violence.\r\nThe United Nations Charter tells us that dialogue\r\nwith those who commit acts of terror is possible only if\r\nthose acts are halted. The pain of thousands of\r\nColombians caused by the kidnapping of their loved\r\nones  the list includes former presidential candidate\r\nIngrid Betancourt; several members of Congress;\r\nmembers of state assemblies; the Governor of my own\r\nstate, a former minister and tireless worker for peace;\r\nmembers of the armed forces, and hundreds of ordinary\r\npeople  demonstrates that we need humanitarian\r\naction that does not fuel violence but that leads us\r\nalong the path of reconciliation.\r\nThe world has plenty of analysts of Colombian\r\nproblems, and plenty of critics of our society and our\r\nsuccessive Governments. We need less rhetoric and\r\nmore action  that is, real contributions to solving the\r\nproblem. We call for effective cooperation, because the\r\nviolence is financed through the international drug\r\ntrade and is waged with weapons not made in\r\nColombia.\r\nLike other nations, we suffer dire poverty,\r\ninjustice, low investor confidence, high debt and a\r\nbudget deficit. We have always honoured and will\r\ncontinue always to honour our international financial\r\ncommitments. We are making unprecedented efforts to\r\nfreeze operating expenditures and to increase taxes.\r\nBut we need significant bilateral and multilateral\r\neconomic support to invest and to expand\r\nemployment  to begin to pay the social debt. A\r\nvictory over violence will trigger economic growth and\r\ncreate resources for social development, which in turn\r\nwill consolidate peace.\r\nOne thought: the price of a pound of Colombian\r\ncoffee was once more than $3; it is now around 60\r\ncents. International banks and cooperation agencies\r\nshould redouble their commitment and resources in\r\nColombia. The money will not to be used for wasteful\r\nexpenditures or to salvage bankruptcies, but will rather\r\nbe invested, in the interest of the poor, to ensure\r\ngovernability.\r\nThe people of Colombia are proud, hard-working,\r\ndemocratic and sensible; their spontaneity has not been\r\nstifled by their suffering. The nation has the most solid\r\ndemocratic tradition, widely recognized long-term\r\neconomic performance, a highly diversified industrial\r\nbase, a productive structure increasingly geared\r\ntowards international markets, and an enormous\r\npotential for small democratic enterprises.\r\nRepresentatives of the peoples of the world: with\r\nyour commitment and support, and with our own\r\ndetermination, Colombia will be freed from the slavery\r\nof violence and will be more prosperous, with greater\r\njustice.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of\r\nthe Congo\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of the\r\nCongo.\r\nMr. Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Denis Sassou-Nguesso,\r\nPresident of the Republic of the Congo, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nguesso (spoke in French): This\r\nsession of the General Assembly is beginning in a\r\ncontext that is still deeply affected by the memory of\r\nthe painful events that struck the United States, and\r\nespecially our host city, just a year ago. So I shall\r\nbegin by paying tribute to the memory of the victims of\r\nthe attacks of 11 September 2001. This sacrifice is a\r\ncruel reminder of how fragile our world remains,\r\nexposed to the most unimaginable threats. Humankind\r\nneeds solidarity, and the Congolese people reaffirms\r\nhere, through me, its solidarity with the people of the\r\nUnited States.\r\nThe election of Mr. Jan Kavan to preside over the\r\nwork of the fifty-seventh session is a tribute to his\r\nbeautiful country, the Czech Republic, and to his\r\nreputation as an outstanding statesman whose\r\nexperience and knowledge will inspire and guide our\r\nwork.\r\nTo Mr. Han Seung-soo, President of the Assembly\r\nat its fifty-sixth session, we express our earnest thanks\r\nfor his excellent work. Likewise, we express to the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, our profound\r\ngratitude and our wishes for success in the noble\r\nmission that he is brilliantly carrying out at the head of\r\nthe Organization. Finally, we welcome and\r\ncongratulate the Swiss Confederation on the occasion\r\nof its admission to the Organization. Undoubtedly, that\r\nis a major event for the United Nations, which thereby\r\ncontinues to increase its effectiveness.\r\nTwo years ago, during the Millennium Summit,\r\nheld in this Hall, the international expressed its wish to\r\nsee established throughout the world a climate of peace\r\nand security favouring broad prospects for international\r\ncooperation, with a view to sustained world\r\ndevelopment. During that historic meeting, the worlds\r\nleaders adopted a Declaration whose ambitions were\r\ncommensurate with the high stakes. In particular, they\r\ncommitted themselves to reducing by half by the year\r\n2015 the proportion of the worlds population living in\r\nconditions of extreme poverty.\r\nSince the Millennium Summit, the international\r\ncommunity has convened a number of meetings whose\r\nobjective was to improve the lives of our peoples\r\nthrough policies of shared management, of solidarity\r\nand of preserving the future in various areas involving\r\nthe responsibility of our States. We should periodically\r\nevaluate our progress, and the current session offers us\r\nthat opportunity.\r\nThe absence of peace  war and insecurity  is\r\ngravely undermining humanity. Unfortunately, no\r\nregion in the world has been spared. Because of\r\nirrationality, the Middle East, a veritable powder keg,\r\nis unravelling before us. The international community\r\nmust become further involved in the talks between\r\nPalestinian and Israelis in order to put an end to the\r\ncycle of violence that has ravaged that part of the world\r\nfor so long.\r\nOur own subregion, which covers the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States  over which we\r\npreside  longs for peace and security. Having\r\nsuffered years of war and instability, Central Africa has\r\nonly one desire: to emerge quickly from this infernal\r\ncycle. In that connection, we should firmly seize every\r\nopportunity available to us in order permanently to\r\nreverse old trends.\r\nIn Angola, the 4 April 2002 signing of a\r\nMemorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the\r\nLusaka Protocol offers a glimmer of hope. We welcome\r\nthe signing of that agreement and, in the same spirit,\r\nmake an earnest appeal to the international community\r\nto give its full support to the populations of those\r\ncountries faced with dire poverty.\r\nThe situation in Burundi remains worrisome\r\ndespite the formation of a Government of national\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nunity. We ask the parties to go even further and to\r\nbegin honest negotiations that could give South African\r\nmediation, which we encourage, every chance of\r\nsuccess.\r\nWith regard to the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, we welcome the peace Agreement of 30 July\r\n2002, signed in Pretoria between the heads of State of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and of Rwanda.\r\nWe also see as a positive development the agreement\r\nreached a few days ago in Luanda between the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. By the\r\nsame token, we encourage the efforts of the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo aimed at concluding\r\nan inclusive agreement involving all the sons and\r\ndaughters of that brotherly country.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, I should like to ask\r\nthe Assembly to devote all necessary attention to the\r\nactivities of the United Nations Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa.\r\nThat Committee has just held its 18th ministerial\r\nmeeting, in Bangui, Central African Republic, and will\r\nreport to the Assembly during the current session. Its\r\nrecommendations deserve broad support from the\r\ninternational community. Central Africa needs to\r\nregain peace and stability in order to play the major\r\nrole warranted by its immense potential.\r\nMost of the conflicts that afflict our planet have\r\ntheir roots in the extreme poverty from which\r\npopulations  especially in developing countries \r\nare suffering. Their poverty is marked by\r\nunderdevelopment, with all its evil effects, which\r\nprevent them from adapting to the new context of the\r\ninternational economy.\r\nIt is with the goal of stopping the cycle of dire\r\npoverty that Africa has established, along with the new\r\nAfrican Union, an original plan for its development:\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD). NEPAD is Africas contribution to assisting\r\nin its own development. This development choice\r\nshares the spirit of the new partnership defined in\r\nMarch 2002 by the Monterrey Consensus and the goals\r\nof the Rome World Food Summit and of the\r\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nSince 15 October 1997, when the transition\r\nperiod in Congo began, my country has been facing\r\nmajor challenges.\r\nThe first of these challenges  to conclude the\r\ntransition and the electoral process  has been met.\r\nThis political development, in spite of the setbacks and\r\ndifficulties encountered, has led, thanks to the\r\ndetermination of the Congolese people, to the\r\nestablishment this year of new democratic institutions\r\nfollowing free and fair general elections.\r\nThe achievement of that first objective has given\r\nus ample opportunity better to take up the other\r\nchallenges and priorities ahead of us, namely the\r\nstrengthening of peace and security, the consolidation\r\nof national unity and democracy, the promotion of\r\nhuman rights, economic reconstruction, and the\r\nrevitalization of international cooperation.\r\nOur determination to engage in active and\r\ndynamic international cooperation is reflected in\r\nparticular in our effective participation in Central\r\nAfrican activities through the Economic and Monetary\r\nCommunity of Central African States and the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States, of\r\nwhich Congo holds the presidency; in our vision of a\r\ncommon future for the peoples of the subregion; and in\r\nour resolute commitment to the Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment.\r\nIt is with great pleasure and conviction that I\r\nconvey to the Assembly the optimism and high hopes\r\nof the Congo  a State that has reclaimed its place in\r\nthe community of nations and intends to keep it. It\r\nwishes to serve as a genuine haven of peace, well-\r\nbeing, prosperity and modernity for current and future\r\ngenerations.\r\nIt is with current and, in particular, future\r\ngenerations in mind that we have resolved, along with\r\nfive other Central African States, to wage a widespread\r\ncampaign to preserve forests, animal life and\r\nbiodiversity in the Congo River Basin.\r\nWe welcome the determination of the United\r\nStates of America, France, Germany, Great Britain,\r\nJapan and South Africa, as well as that of major\r\ninternational organizations, specialized non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and forestry companies to\r\ntake an active part in what we call the Congo Basin\r\nInitiative.\r\nIt is also with the goal of speeding up the\r\nimplementation of the objectives of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and of a healthy environment that my\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\ncountry is committed to acceding, in the coming\r\nmonths, to the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nThe Congo hopes to be a State that unreservedly\r\nabides by the universal principles and values of human\r\nrights, peace, fundamental freedoms and good\r\ngovernance.\r\nThere can be no doubt that this vision is shared\r\nby all of our States. It is the basis our of Organization,\r\nwhose principal objective is to work for peace and\r\nfreedom throughout the world.\r\nThe United Nations must tirelessly and resolutely\r\nwork daily for the triumph of peace and freedom. Let\r\nus not forget this. We cannot forget that the United\r\nNations was create to save succeeding generations\r\nfrom the scourge of war. It was created essentially for\r\npeace.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof the Congo for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the\r\nRepublic of the Congo, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of\r\nthe Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nMadagascar.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Marc Ravalomanana,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Madagascar, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ravalomanana (spoke in French):\r\nThe Madagascar delegation, which I have the honour\r\nof leading for the first time at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, is delighted to congratulate Mr. Jan\r\nKavan on his well-deserved election to the presidency\r\nof this session, and we wish him every success.\r\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, we\r\nexpress our most sincere appreciation for having led\r\nthe fifty-sixth session to a successful conclusion\r\nthrough dedication and skilful leadership.\r\nThe dedication of our Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, to the attainment of the objectives of\r\nthe United Nations deserves our full appreciation and\r\ngratitude.\r\nThe admission of the Swiss Confederation as a\r\nnew Member of the United Nations is for Madagascar a\r\nsource of profound satisfaction. This friendly country\r\nis a living example of a peaceful and multicultural\r\nsociety based on values of democracy and freedom.\r\nHere today, in the framework of the\r\ncommemoration of the tragic events of 11 September\r\n2001, we wish to express our solidarity with the people\r\nand the Government of the United States. We reiterate\r\nour condemnation of such terrorist acts, whose\r\nconsequences are incalculable. A global phenomenon\r\nwithout borders, terrorism is considered to be the most\r\ndangerous enemy of the new millennium. It can be\r\neradicated only through harmonious international\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn this regard, we wish to pay tribute here to the\r\nefforts of the United Nations, acting through the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee created by the Security\r\nCouncil, for the implementation of Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), and we commend all other regional\r\ninitiatives adopted to combat this plague. To fight\r\nterrorism, countries such as ours will need special\r\ntechnical assistance in order to implement this\r\nresolution of the United Nations, as well as other\r\ninternational treaties.\r\nThe persistence of areas of tension and conflict\r\naround the world, especially the Middle East, demands\r\nthe reinvigoration of the United Nations to make it\r\nmore effective in responding to the needs of the\r\ninternational community, particularly in maintaining\r\ninternational peace and security. To pursue this critical\r\nobjective, we must now more than ever strengthen our\r\nefforts to make the Security Council more democratic,\r\nmore representative and more transparent.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations\r\nprovides us with the ideal framework for creating\r\nconditions that encourage States and peoples to choose\r\npeace over war. In this regard, Madagascar wishes to\r\ncongratulate Timor-Leste on its independence after a\r\nvaliant and heroic struggle by the people of that\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\ncountry and successful efforts by the United Nations to\r\nre-establish peace there.\r\nFurthermore, Madagascar encourages the\r\nmediation efforts undertaken by the United Nations for\r\nthe settlement of conflicts in a number of countries\r\nthroughout Africa. In this context, I wish to reiterate\r\nthe profound gratitude of the Malagasy people for the\r\nrole the United Nations agreed to play in resolving the\r\npost-election dispute that threatened Madagascar. This\r\ncrisis is now over and Madagascar is now experiencing\r\na new era full of hope.\r\nWe are convinced that sustainable development\r\nrequires the consolidation of the rule of law and the\r\nestablishment of good governance. Towards this end,\r\nthe new Government is taking all appropriate measures\r\nfor the sound and rational management of public\r\nfinances and of international assistance. Madagascar\r\nhas given the fight against corruption the very highest\r\npriority. We have also taken the initiative to insure that\r\nan effective policy is developed and applied in order to\r\ntackle this evil on all fronts. Madagascar supports\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 55/61, through which our\r\nGeneral Assembly decided to create an ad hoc\r\ncommittee entrusted with negotiating a future legal\r\ninstrument against corruption. Our country is awaiting\r\nthe conclusion of such an instrument in the near future,\r\nin order to fill the gaps in its own legal system. We\r\nlook forward with considerable interest to the high-\r\nlevel Conference in Mexico in 2003 for signing a\r\nconvention against corruption.\r\nThe rapid and sustainable development of\r\nMadagascar is the major and fundamental objective of\r\nthe present Government, in order to extract the country\r\nfrom the scourge of poverty, a source of instability that\r\nerodes democratic values. In this context, Madagascar\r\nis committed to a pro-active policy aimed at recovery\r\nfor rapid and sustainable growth of its economy, in\r\nwhich the private sector will be the driving force.\r\nAs we see it, the key to development is\r\npartnership between the public sector and the private\r\nsector, in which the Government works together with\r\nprivate companies and non-governmental organizations\r\nsolely for the benefit of the people. We invite private\r\nbusinesses to invest in Madagascar. The returns on\r\nthose investments will be beneficial both to them and\r\nto the Malagasy people.\r\nAs an essential component of development and of\r\npeace, education is our priority of priorities. Malagasy\r\nchildren will live fully in the world of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, which is characterized by advanced\r\ntechnology of information and communications. Thus,\r\nMadagascar welcomes the adoption of Assembly\r\nresolution 56/258 calling for a World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society to be held in 2003 and in 2005.\r\nThe world community will then have a unique\r\nopportunity to discuss information and develop the\r\nopportunities offered by digital technologies, in\r\nparticular in Africa and in the least developed\r\ncountries.\r\nThe Republic of Madagascar is ready to do\r\neverything in its power to put the country back on the\r\npath of development. This will be done with the\r\nsupport of the international community in the\r\nframework of mutually advantageous cooperation.\r\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude\r\nand our appreciation to all of Madagascars\r\ndevelopment partners, bilateral, regional and multi-\r\nlateral, for their valuable contribution to the re-\r\nlaunching of economic activity in our country.\r\nFaced with multiple challenges in our era, a time\r\ndominated by poverty and underdevelopment,\r\ninternational cooperation is no longer a choice; it is an\r\nabsolute necessity for the survival of humanity. Those\r\nfactors that diminish us as human beings: poverty,\r\nHIV/AIDS, famine and illiteracy, cannot be eliminated\r\nwithout a true spirit of solidarity, guaranteeing a better\r\nfuture for all people. Let us not forget that the\r\npreamble of our Charter announces a new humanity\r\nwith peoples and human beings living in dignity and\r\nsecurity. Towards that end, they must have access to\r\nfundamental human rights, the right to health care, the\r\nright to education and to culture, and the right to a\r\ndecent income. Our mission, to reduce poverty\r\neverywhere in the world, has become today more\r\nimportant and more urgent than ever before.\r\nThe slowdown in economic activity, on a global\r\nscale, following the attacks of 11 September 2001, has\r\nworsened impoverishment and plunged millions of\r\nindividuals into a state of dire need. In this grim\r\ncontext, globalization could play a vital role in the\r\nfight against poverty, as long as the countries of the\r\nnorth and the south are offered the same opportunities\r\nof development.\r\nIn order for globalization to truly benefit\r\nhumankind, it must take into consideration the interests\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nof all countries the world over, in an international\r\neconomy of sharing.\r\nGlobal interdependence and better international\r\neconomic cooperation must be entirely accepted, if we\r\nare to obtain the objectives of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. A collective awareness to develop a real\r\npartnership for development is indispensable in order\r\nto make a reality of that objective. In this spirit,\r\nMadagascar welcomes the consensus reached at the\r\nInternational Conference On Financing For\r\nDevelopment, which was held in Monterrey.\r\nIn the same context, Madagascar urges the\r\ninternational community to give firm and concrete\r\nsupport to the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), and to give that support both\r\nbilaterally and multilaterally. With the objective of\r\ngiving an important role to the private sector in\r\ndevelopment, Madagascar fully and without reserve\r\nsupports the principles and objectives underlying\r\nNEPAD. In the coming months, I intend to make\r\nMadagascar one of the leading countries of NEPAD,\r\nbecause I am sincerely committed to good governance,\r\nthe development of infrastructures and energy,\r\neducation, new technologies, access to the markets of\r\ndeveloped countries and the protection of the\r\nenvironment.\r\nThe alarming conclusions of a United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme report entitled Africa\r\nEnvironment Outlook, as well as the recent weather-\r\nrelated disasters in Central Europe and Asia, require\r\nthe international community to develop a new code of\r\nethics for the conservation and effective protection of\r\nthe environment. Our Government will make the\r\nprotection of our precious environment one of our main\r\npriorities. Furthermore, Madagascar hopes that the\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development held in\r\nJohannesburg a few days ago will give new impetus to\r\nour collective determination to offer all countries an\r\nopportunity to develop in a way that benefits their\r\ninhabitants, their environment and our shared heritage,\r\nthe Earth.\r\nBy some standards, Madagascar is a poor country.\r\nHowever, it is rich in unique natural resources and in\r\neducated human resources. Above all, its population is\r\nattached to democracy, family values and belief in\r\nGod.\r\nWe would like today to express our desire to\r\ncooperate with the United Nations as a partner for the\r\nreconstruction of Madagascar. By working in\r\npartnership, we will ensure for our country a future of\r\nhope. The entire world will come to know us by our\r\nstrengths, not our weaknesses.\r\nWorking together with the United Nations family,\r\nMadagascar is ready to make its own contribution to\r\nbuilding a global village in which all countries receive\r\nequal treatment and have equal opportunities for full\r\ndevelopment  an indispensable condition for the\r\nestablishment of lasting peace.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of\r\nMadagascar for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of India\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof India.\r\nMr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of India, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of India, and inviting him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Vajpayee (India) (spoke in Hindi; English\r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I\r\ncongratulate Mr. Kavan on his election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I also\r\nextend my best wishes to Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan in this first year of his second term in office.\r\nTwo days ago, we commemorated the first\r\nanniversary of a terrible event that focused the\r\ncollective global consciousness on international\r\nterrorism. Terrorism did not start on 11 September. It\r\nwas on that day that it brazenly announced itself on the\r\nglobal stage, flaunting its immunity from distance and\r\npower.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nAs a country exposed to the depredations of\r\nterrorism for decades, India empathized with the pain\r\nof the American people, admired their resilience in\r\ncoming to terms with the consequences and supported\r\nthe bold decision to counter-attack terrorism at its very\r\nsource.\r\nThe international community has taken some\r\ncollective decisions in the global effort to combat\r\nterrorism and to choke off its lifelines. Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) contains the essence of\r\nthese decisions. The Councils Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee should now move beyond information\r\ncompilation and legal assistance to enforcing\r\ncompliance by States known to be sponsoring,\r\nsheltering, funding, arming and training terrorists.\r\nIn our South Asian region, nuclear blackmail has\r\nemerged over the past few months as a new arrow in\r\nthe quiver of State-sponsored terrorism. Dark threats\r\nwere held out that actions by India to stamp out cross-\r\nborder terrorism could provoke a nuclear war. To\r\nsuccumb to such blatant nuclear terrorism would mean\r\nforgetting the bitter lessons of the 11 September\r\ntragedy.\r\nAs far as India is concerned, we have repeatedly\r\nclarified that no one in our country wants a war,\r\nconventional or otherwise. Nor are we seeking any\r\nterritory. But absolutely everyone in India wants an end\r\nto the cross-border terrorism which has claimed\r\nthousands of innocent lives and denied entire\r\ngenerations their right to a peaceful existence with\r\nnormal economic and social activity. We are\r\ndetermined to end it with all the means at our\r\ncommand. Let there be no doubt about that in any\r\nquarter.\r\nYesterday we heard the extraordinary claim in\r\nthis Assembly that the brutal murder of innocent\r\ncivilians in Jammu and Kashmir is actually a freedom\r\nstruggle and that the forthcoming elections in that state\r\nare a farce, since they cannot be a substitute for a\r\nplebiscite demanded over 50 years ago. It requires an\r\neffort of acrobatic logic to believe that the carnage\r\namong innocents is an instrument for freedom and that\r\nelections are a symbol of deception and repression. If\r\nthe elections are a mere fraud, why are terrorists being\r\ntrained and infiltrating India at the command of the\r\nInter-Services Intelligence Agency of Pakistan to kill\r\nelection candidates and to intimidate voters?\r\nIf Pakistan claims to be a crucial partner in the\r\ninternational coalition against terrorism, how can it\r\ncontinue to use terrorism as an instrument of State\r\npolicy against India?\r\nMr. Nguyen Dy Nien (Viet Nam), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nHow can the international coalition condone\r\nPakistan-directed killings of thousands of innocent\r\ncivilians  women and children included  to\r\npromote a bizarre version of self-determination? Those\r\nwho speak of underlying or root causes of terrorism\r\noffer alibis to the terrorists and absolve them of\r\nresponsibility for their heinous actions, such as the 11\r\nSeptember attacks on the United States or the 13\r\nDecember attack on our Parliament.\r\nYesterday we heard yet another patently false and\r\nself-serving claim that in India Muslims and other\r\nminorities are the target of Hindu extremists. With 150\r\nmillion Muslims, India has the second largest Muslim\r\npopulation in the world; greater than that of Pakistan.\r\nWe are proud of the multi-religious character of our\r\nsociety. Equal respect for all faiths and non-\r\ndiscrimination on the basis of religion are not just part\r\nof our Constitutional obligations, but, as the whole\r\nworld knows, they are the signature theme of Indias\r\ncivilization and culture.\r\nWe have to recognize that the developmental\r\ndivide between the North and the South is becoming\r\nwider and deeper by the day. The challenges that face\r\nus are stark, and there is no alternative to having all\r\ncountries of the world join hands to face them together.\r\nOver the last decade, 10 million people have been\r\njoining the ranks of the poor each year. A quarter of the\r\nworlds population lives in extreme poverty.\r\nWe have to find US$ 24 billion annually for\r\ninvestment in poor countries, if we are to achieve the\r\nWorld Food Summit goal of halving hunger by 2015.\r\nThe continuation of widespread poverty, at a time\r\nwhen unimaginable wealth is concentrated in a small\r\nsocial layer, is totally unacceptable. The twenty-first\r\ncentury has all the means to end this sad legacy of the\r\npast centuries. What is lacking is the political will\r\namong the developed countries to sincerely and\r\nspeedily address the legitimate developmental needs of\r\nthe developing countries, especially the least developed\r\nones.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nCasting an even longer shadow over this grim\r\ndevelopmental canvas is global climate change, from\r\nwhich the poor will most suffer, though they\r\ncontributed least to it. The recent floods and forest fires\r\nin Europe are a forewarning that the countries of Asia\r\nand Africa are not the only victims of the fury of a\r\ndegraded environment. The Earths atmosphere and\r\nbiosphere know no national boundaries. The choice\r\nbefore the global community is stark: Either we take\r\nurgent steps to protect the environment or be prepared\r\nfor far worse natural calamities.\r\nEarly this month, the Johannesburg Summit for\r\nSustainable Development debated some of the linkages\r\nbetween poverty, trade, environment, national,\r\ninternational and corporate governance and global\r\nfinancial flows. We emerged from the Summit with\r\nsome encouraging outcomes, but these fell well short\r\nof the demands of our time.\r\nIt has become a categorical imperative to\r\nunderstand and address mans developmental needs in\r\ntheir totality, and not in isolated parts. It is\r\ndisconcerting that the highways of development are\r\njammed with the noisy and unruly traffic of\r\nmaterialism and its brash cousin, consumerism. Human\r\nvalues have become mute bystanders in most political,\r\neconomic and social activities.\r\nThe result of this imbalance between our material\r\nand non-material needs can never be happy for\r\nmankind. On the contrary, if we are guided by\r\ncompassion, care, feeling for our fellow human beings,\r\ncooperation and other human values, we are bound to\r\nget the right solutions to every problem on our planet.\r\nHumanity is crying out for a harmonious\r\nintegration of the economic, social, political,\r\nenvironmental and spiritual dimensions of\r\ndevelopment. This task calls for the closest possible\r\ncooperation among nations and communities, with a\r\nreadiness to accept the best from every cultural and\r\nspiritual tradition around the globe. The United Nations\r\nneeds to take up newer and bigger initiatives in this\r\ndirection.\r\nIn this Assembly, less than a year ago, and in the\r\nUnited States Congress the year before, I had extended\r\nIndias offer to coordinate a comprehensive global\r\ndevelopment dialogue. I reiterate that offer today. If we\r\nare to achieve the development goals we have promised\r\nourselves by 2015, we need such a dialogue urgently.\r\nAs we come together once again at the United\r\nNations, at a time of new and diverse challenges, we\r\nshould reflect on our collective commitment to the\r\nCharter, its purposes and principles. There is a growing\r\nperception, particularly among the weaker and poorer\r\ncountries, that responses to issues of far-reaching\r\nimpact often seem arbitrary and contradictory.\r\nA common destiny is at stake. The world needs\r\ncollective multilateralism. It needs the United Nations,\r\nthe coming together and working together of all its\r\nnations in the development of a common and collective\r\nperspective.\r\nConflicts arise when there is no spirit of\r\ndemocracy within and among nations. A genuinely\r\ndemocratic framework enables us to respect alternative\r\npoints of view, to value diversity and to fashion\r\nsolutions responsive to the aspirations of people.\r\nIndias own experience as a hugely populated and\r\ndiverse nation shows how complex problems can be\r\naddressed within a constitutional and democratic\r\nframework.\r\nThese values need to be assiduously nurtured in\r\nour societies, so that at least a future generation is rid\r\nof the scourge of poverty, intolerance, obscurantism\r\nand religious extremism.\r\nDemocratic societies are far less prone to\r\nideologies based on violence or militarist yearnings,\r\nsince they do not have their fingers permanently on the\r\ntrigger of a gun. We have to be vigilant against threats\r\nto democracy worldwide arising from forces that are\r\nopposed to it, be they rooted in fundamentalist political\r\nideologies or extremist religious dogmas.\r\nAll of us are aware of the challenges. Most of us\r\nare agreed that a stable global order has to rest on the\r\nfour strong pillars of peace, security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and democracy. We have to ensure that\r\neach of these pillars is strong and resilient.\r\nWe are conscious of our collective responsibility.\r\nIt is the leap from this theoretical understanding to its\r\npractical realization that we have often failed to\r\nexecute. We should not fail again. Our future\r\ngenerations will not forgive us if we do.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of India for the statement he has just made.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nMr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of\r\nIndia, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Junichiro Koizumi, Prime Minister\r\nof Japan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear\r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Junichiro Koizumi,\r\nPrime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Junichiro Koizumi, Prime Minister of Japan,\r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Junichiro Koizumi,\r\nPrime Minister of Japan, and inviting him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Koizumi (Japan): First of all, I would like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his assumption of the\r\nPresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. At the same time, I pay high tribute to\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo, former President of the General\r\nAssembly, for his leadership.\r\nI am pleased on this occasion to congratulate\r\nSwitzerland on becoming a United Nations Member\r\nState. My congratulations also go to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, which declared its\r\nindependence on 20 May. Japan heartily supports its\r\nadmission to the membership of the United Nations.\r\nThe Peace Bell in the garden of United Nations\r\nHeadquarters was presented to the United Nations in\r\n1954 by the Japanese people with a prayer for world\r\npeace. It has been rung every year for world peace. The\r\nbeautiful sound of the bell, which was made from coins\r\ncollected from all over the world, reminds us of what\r\nthe United Nations represents.\r\nIn order to ensure world peace and prosperity, we\r\nneed to harmonize a range of efforts which encompass\r\nnot only military measures, but also initiatives for the\r\nsolution of poverty problems and the establishment of\r\nsocial infrastructures that will put an end to human\r\nrights violations. The United Nations should be a\r\nforum where the contributions of each and every State\r\nare consolidated and implemented in the most efficient\r\nmanner. No single State or organization can accomplish\r\nthis. Only the United Nations is capable of carrying out\r\nsuch a lofty task.\r\nIn this connection, I would like to refer to the\r\nissue of Iraq, which is of grave concern to the\r\ninternational community. Iraq must comply with all the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. In particular,\r\nIraq must allow immediate and unconditional\r\ninspections and dispose of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. It is important for the international\r\ncommunity to continue to work together and to engage\r\nmore strenuously in diplomatic efforts through the\r\nUnited Nations. In doing so, we must pursue the\r\nadoption of necessary and appropriate Security Council\r\nresolutions as soon as possible.\r\nTerrorism remains a critical issue this year.\r\nToday, in addition to terrorism, I would like to take up\r\nother major challenges which the United Nations must\r\naddress and to describe Japans contributions in those\r\nareas, namely, the consolidation of peace and nation-\r\nbuilding, the environment and development, and\r\nnuclear disarmament. I will also touch upon my ideas\r\nfor the realization of United Nations reform, which is\r\nessential in order for this Organization to tackle these\r\nchallenges successfully.\r\nThe first challenge is the fight against terrorism.\r\nJust after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, I\r\nvisited ground zero. Seeing with my own eyes the\r\nmagnitude of the destruction, I was speechless at the\r\nenormity of the terrorist attack. 11 September is a\r\nchallenge not only to the United States, but also to all\r\nhumankind. The prevention and eradication of\r\nterrorism are an important task for the United Nations\r\nand, indeed, for all Member States.\r\nJapan calls upon all States to accede to\r\ninternational conventions related to terrorism. It is\r\nimportant to develop international norms in this area,\r\nsuch as a comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism and an international convention for the\r\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. Safe havens\r\nfor terrorists cannot be allowed. Japan will further\r\nstrengthen its domestic counter-terrorism measures.\r\nConsulting closely with the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee of the Security Council, it will share its\r\nknowledge and expertise in counter-terrorism measures\r\nwith those States that are in need of it. Japan will\r\nrespond to threats where weapons of mass destruction\r\nmight be used in acts of terrorism by actively joining\r\nthe efforts of the international community to prevent\r\nthe proliferation of these weapons.\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nThe second challenge is the consolidation of\r\npeace and nation-building. Japan attaches great\r\nimportance to extending post-conflict assistance for the\r\nconsolidation of peace and nation-building to prevent\r\nthe recurrence of conflicts. Having developed a\r\nmechanism to enable it to cooperate effectively in\r\nbroader areas, Japan has entered a new stage in its\r\ncooperation with peacekeeping operations. This\r\npositive posture is manifested in its deployment since\r\nFebruary of 690 Self-Defence Force personnel, mainly\r\nas an engineer group, to the peacekeeping operation in\r\nEast Timor. Japan will enhance its cooperation in other\r\nareas as well, such as demining, rehabilitation of\r\ninfrastructure, elections and the establishment of\r\nsystems for internal security.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nConcerning Afghanistan, at the International\r\nConference on Reconstruction Assistance to\r\nAfghanistan held in Tokyo in January, Japan strove to\r\nsolidify the resolve of the international community. We\r\nare now preparing a programme to assist the\r\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants,\r\nwhich will give form to our proposed Register for\r\nPeace. My country is also contributing to regional\r\nreconstruction by developing an assistance project for\r\nthe resettlement of refugees and displaced people in\r\nsuch areas as Kandahar.\r\nIn the Middle East, it is crucial that the vision of\r\nthe peaceful coexistence of Israel and an independent\r\nPalestinian State materialize as early as possible. Japan\r\nwill assist the reform of the Palestinian Authority,\r\nwhich is aimed at the establishment of a new State by\r\nthe Palestinian people. We will do so particularly by\r\nproviding technical assistance for democratization.\r\nElections by the Palestinians are the first step towards\r\nnation-building and I believe that the international\r\ncommunity should extend assistance to ensure their\r\nsuccess. However, putting an end to the vicious circle\r\nof violence remains our most urgent task. Japan\r\nresolutely condemns terrorist acts by Palestinian\r\nextremists and strongly urges Israel to immediately\r\nwithdraw its troops to the line of September 2000, halt\r\nits military operations and lift the economic closures in\r\nthe autonomous areas.\r\nIn Africa, peace and stability are prerequisites for\r\ndevelopment. We are encouraged by the positive\r\nmovements in that continent, such as the realization of\r\npeace in Angola and a partial ceasefire in Sudan. Japan\r\nwill actively support the efforts of African States for\r\nconflict resolution and the consolidation of peace.\r\nThe third challenge is the simultaneous\r\nachievement of environmental protection and\r\ndevelopment. Towards that end, it is of course\r\nimportant to utilize all available financial resources and\r\nto develop human resources, which are the engine of\r\nnation-building. However, ownership by developing\r\ncountries and their partnership with the international\r\ncommunity, which supports their ownership, are also\r\nessential.\r\nIn this respect, we welcome the development of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD) and the establishment of the African Union\r\nas manifestations of ownership by African countries. In\r\norder to help strengthen both African ownership and\r\nthe partnership with the international community, and\r\nbuilding on the results of the successful World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development that took place in\r\nJohannesburg, Japan will convene the third Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development\r\n(TICAD III) in October 2003. Also, in pursuit of\r\nsustainable development, it will host an international\r\nministerial-level conference on water in Kyoto in\r\nMarch 2003. Japan will continue to participate actively\r\nin worldwide actions for environmental protection and\r\ndevelopment by providing expertise and taking\r\nconcrete action.\r\nFourthly, I would like to touch upon the nuclear\r\ndisarmament issue. I believe that Japan, as the only\r\ncountry in human history to have suffered nuclear\r\ndevastation, has a significant role to play in nuclear\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Japan will continue\r\nits efforts to realize a peaceful and safe world, free of\r\nnuclear weapons, as early as possible. To that end, we\r\nwill propose a draft resolution entitled A path to the\r\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons at this session of\r\nthe General Assembly, and we will redouble our efforts\r\nto achieve the early entry into force of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWhen addressing these challenges, we must\r\nensure that the variety of measures taken by Member\r\nStates are effectively coordinated. The United Nations\r\nmust exercise its leadership in this endeavour. We, that\r\nis all Member States, must breathe new life into the\r\nUnited Nations by strengthening its functions through\r\nreforms. Next year, the debate on Security Council\r\nreform will enter its tenth year. I believe that we should\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nnow focus our discussion on such questions as the\r\nnumber of seats on an enlarged Security Council. Japan\r\nintends to work hard to that end. In this connection, I\r\nwould remind all Member States of the question of the\r\nenemy State clauses, meaningless legacies of the\r\ntwentieth century, that remain in the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nSince assuming office as Prime Minister in April\r\n2001, I have proceeded with a series of reforms to\r\nenable Japan to respond appropriately to the new era.\r\nThe United Nations also must continue to reform itself\r\nso as to respond to new situations in the world by\r\nconstantly reviewing its organization and functions.\r\nThe prescription for reform is already shown in the\r\nMillennium Declaration. In order to achieve the goals\r\ncontained in the Declaration and build a more peaceful,\r\nprosperous and just world, every Member State should\r\nrenew its determination to achieve reform in the United\r\nNations and take actions toward that end. Japan will\r\nmake its utmost efforts to ensure that the United\r\nNations is able to meet the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Junichiro Koizumi, Prime Minister of Japan,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Sir Anerood\r\nJugnauth, Prime Minister of the Republic\r\nof Mauritius\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius.\r\nThe Right Honourable Sir Anerood Jugnauth,\r\nPrime Minister of Mauritius, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir\r\nAnerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth (Mauritius): It gives me\r\nimmense pleasure to address the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the United Nations General Assembly under your\r\nable leadership. Allow me, on behalf of my delegation,\r\nto extend to you our wholehearted congratulations on\r\nyour election as the President of the present session. I\r\nwish to assure you of my delegations support and\r\ncooperation throughout your tenure of office.\r\nI also wish to convey my thanks to His\r\nExcellency Dr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of\r\nKorea for the remarkable manner in which he\r\nconducted the work of the Assemblys fifty-sixth\r\nsession. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nalso deserves our gratitude for his inspiring and\r\ncommendable initiatives in furthering the objectives of\r\nour Organization.\r\nWe are happy that the Swiss Confederation and\r\nTimor-Leste have joined us as the newest members of\r\nthe United Nations family. Timor-Leste stands out as a\r\nshining accomplishment of the United Nations system\r\nto uphold the right to independence of a nation in\r\nadverse conditions.\r\nThe terrorist atrocities of 11 September will never\r\nfade from our collective consciousness, and the agony\r\nand the pain of the day are still with us. The\r\nsophisticated infrastructure of the terrorist\r\norganizations that was utilized to inflict that\r\nmonstrosity must be dismantled at any cost. We owe it\r\nto ourselves and to the generations that will come after\r\nus to mobilize all our energies and efforts to never let\r\nthat happen again, anywhere.\r\nMauritius is committed to remain fully engaged\r\nin the global coalition against terrorism, and we shall\r\ncontinue, together with other States, to take all\r\nmeasures  nationally, regionally and internationally \r\nso that the scourge of terrorism is never inflicted on\r\nunsuspecting civilians and countries. We are alive to\r\nthe chilling reality that no country is or ever will be\r\nsafe until the war against terrorism is finally and\r\ncompletely won. We condemn cross-border infiltration;\r\nit must stop and must be made to stop.\r\nThe threats posed by international terrorism have\r\nheightened the need for collective action to preserve\r\nworld peace and security. While we combine our\r\nefforts to wage a war on terrorism, we should, at the\r\nsame time, continue to work towards global\r\ndisarmament and a complete elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction within a specified time frame. My\r\ndelegation reiterates its appeal for the early convening\r\nof a conference on nuclear disarmament.\r\nThe term of Mauritius as an elected non-\r\npermanent member of the Security Council will end in\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nDecember this year. During its tenure on the Council,\r\nMauritius was instrumental in the establishment of an\r\nad hoc working group on conflict prevention and\r\nresolution in Africa. It has made positive and\r\nconstructive recommendations that have been endorsed\r\nby the Security Council.\r\nIn contrast to previous years, when the General\r\nAssembly listened to a litany of horror stories out of\r\nAfrica, I am happy to note that substantial and positive\r\ndevelopments are taking place on the continent. There\r\nis a new dawn in Africa and the stark realization that,\r\nwithout enduring peace and stability, there will be no\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe congratulate the African leaders who have\r\nspared no effort in the search for African solutions to\r\nAfrican conflicts and crises. The Pretoria Agreement\r\nbetween Presidents Kabila and Kagame represents a\r\nmajor breakthrough for the peace process in the Great\r\nLakes region. We are aware that the implementation\r\nwill be difficult. We are, however, confident that the\r\ninternational community will provide all necessary\r\nassistance to the leaders in the region for a smooth\r\nimplementation.\r\nWith the positive developments in Angola, the\r\nsuccessful general elections in Sierra Leone, the\r\nsettlement of the boundary problem between Eritrea\r\nand Ethiopia and the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation\r\nAgreement for Burundi, there are clear signals that\r\nsome of the major conflicts in Africa are being\r\nsuccessfully resolved.\r\nAs Africa embarks on the road of peace, we wish\r\nto underscore the crucial role played by the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\r\nSouthern African Development Community in their\r\nrelentless search for negotiated settlement of the\r\nconflicts in our respective subregions. There is cause\r\nfor optimism, and it is gratifying that the days of doom\r\nand gloom for Africa are on their way to extinction.\r\nOur region, the Indian Ocean, which has\r\nwitnessed some turbulent times recently, is again\r\npoised for stability and development. We applaud the\r\nreturn to constitutional rule in the Comoros and the\r\nconsolidation of democratic institutions in that country.\r\nWe also welcome the formation of a Government of\r\nnational reconciliation in Madagascar and the efforts\r\nunder way to undo the damage caused by the recent\r\ncrisis there. Mauritius will be closely associated with\r\nthe countries of our region to further enhance regional\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe launching of the African Union in Durban,\r\nSouth Africa, in July this year was indeed a historic\r\nand emotionally charged occasion. The birth of the\r\nAfrican Union heralds a new era of political, economic\r\nand social transformation for our continent. The\r\ncontinent is more than ever determined to shape its\r\ndestiny and to tackle comprehensively the burning\r\nproblems of poverty, hunger, disease and\r\nunderdevelopment that have debilitated millions of\r\nAfricans over the years. The African Union has raised\r\nexpectations that we, as leaders, are committed to\r\nhonour. The African Union will be able to respond in a\r\npositive manner to the challenges confronting it, as\r\nwell as maximizing the opportunities for the\r\nimprovement of the lives of peoples of the continent. In\r\nthat context, the decision of African countries to take\r\nresponsibility for peacekeeping on the continent needs\r\nto be encouraged. Since the burden of peacekeeping\r\nmust be equitably shared, I am pleased to announce\r\nthat Mauritius will contribute to the United Nations\r\ncivilian police for service in post-conflict operations.\r\nAlong with the launching of the African Union,\r\nthe home-grown New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is another chapter in the\r\nunfolding of the success story of the African continent.\r\nNEPAD commits Africa to building a strong and\r\nenduring culture of democracy, respect for human\r\nrights and accountability for the continent. Indeed, the\r\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism is a credible\r\nmechanism to promote the prospects of internationally\r\nrecognized norms and standards of good governance.\r\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt (ICC) marks a watershed in mankinds quest to\r\nput an end to impunity and to bring to justice those\r\nresponsible for crimes against humanity, for genocide\r\nand for international crimes. The ICC is the single most\r\nimportant institution of this millennium, and it is the\r\nduty of the international community to fully support it.\r\nIn May this year, during the special session on\r\nchildren, Mauritius had the opportunity to join the\r\ninternational efforts to pave the way for effective\r\nprotection for every child in every part of the world.\r\nThe children who addressed the gathering uttered\r\nwords of great significance that no one can, or should,\r\never forget. The future is theirs, and it is for them that\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nwe ought to ensure the sustainable development of our\r\none and only planet. My country will ensure that the\r\nprinciples, goals and actions discussed during the\r\nspecial session are integrated in our various child\r\nwelfare programmes.\r\nThe Middle East is still not at peace. The death\r\ntoll rises every day, but we are encouraged by the\r\nsignals being sent by both the Israelis and the\r\nPalestinian leadership. Our vision of the Middle East is\r\nto see the early establishment of a Palestinian State\r\nliving side by side with Israel on the basis of agreed\r\nand secure boundaries. The Palestinians also need to\r\nhave State machinery that observes the fundamental\r\nnorms of a democratic system, with responsibility and\r\naccountability on the part of the leaders. They alone\r\nhave the absolute right to elect their leaders when\r\nelections are held in January 2003.\r\nWe appeal to the Iraqi authorities to comply fully\r\nand unconditionally with Security Council resolutions\r\nwith respect to allowing the arms inspectors to fulfil\r\ntheir mandate.\r\nSmall island developing States are a particularly\r\nvulnerable group of countries by virtue of their\r\ninherent natural and structural constraints. The World\r\nBank; the Commonwealth; the United Nations\r\nConference on Financing for Development, held in\r\nMonterrey, Mexico; and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, held recently in\r\nJohannesburg, South Africa, have all recognized that\r\nthose constraints, if not addressed effectively, could\r\nundermine the trade and development prospects of\r\nthese countries, leading to their further\r\nmarginalization. We look forward to specific and\r\nconcrete recommendations for action in this regard at\r\nthe Fifth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization scheduled to be held next September in\r\nMexico.\r\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\r\naddressed the fundamental question of what kind of\r\nworld we want for ourselves and for generations that\r\nare yet unborn. The recent devastating floods in Europe\r\nand Asia, as well as the droughts in many parts of\r\nAfrica  particularly Southern Africa, where there are\r\nmore than 13 million people in danger of famine  are\r\na stark reminder of the fragility of our planets\r\necosystem. The World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment has made the whole world conscious of\r\nthe havoc that nature may cause unless drastic\r\nmeasures are taken immediately to redress the\r\necological imbalance.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Ninth Summit of La Francophonie, which\r\nLebanon will host next month and which will be held\r\non the topic dialogue of cultures, will undoubtedly\r\nenable the French-speaking community to foster\r\nsharing among various cultures with a view to\r\nmaintaining peace, security and democracy.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nMauritius reaffirms its legitimate sovereignty\r\nover the Chagos Archipelago, including the island of\r\nDiego Garcia, which was detached from the territory of\r\nMauritius by the United Kingdom prior to our\r\nindependence. We renew our call to the former colonial\r\nPower, the United Kingdom, to accelerate discussions\r\nwith us for an early settlement of this issue. The\r\npersons of Mauritian origin who were displaced from\r\nthe Chagos Archipelago continue to claim redress for\r\nthe serious human rights violations that they endured.\r\nWe support their efforts to seek redress.\r\nWe also call on the French Government to work\r\ntowards the resolution of the dispute concerning\r\nTromelin Island, over which Mauritius has sovereignty.\r\nIn conclusion, Mauritius reiterates its conviction\r\nthat the United Nations system remains the best\r\nguarantee for international peace and security.\r\nThe framework within which the United Nations\r\norganizes the collective security of States may not be\r\nperfect, but it is at least one that is tested and has\r\nserved us relatively well for more than 50 years.\r\nWorking on the basis of the neutrality of rules and\r\nprinciples is far preferable to the haphazardness of\r\nexpediency. We also should not be unmindful of the\r\nlinkages which exist between different situations, and\r\nthat is why we urge the international community to\r\nobserve the principle of equality of treatment in all\r\ncases.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nThe Right Honourable Sir Anerood Jugnauth,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nAddress by Mr. Silvio Berlusconi, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Italian Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by His Excellency Mr. Silvio Berlusconi,\r\nPrime Minister of the Italian Republic.\r\nMr. Silvio Berlusconi, Prime Minister of the\r\nItalian Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Silvio Berlusconi,\r\nPrime Minister of the Italian Republic, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Berlusconi (Italy): One year has gone by\r\nsince the terrorist attack on the United States, which\r\ninflicted such deep wounds on the city that welcomes\r\nus today. By striking this city, this nation, this\r\ndemocracy, the terrorists intended to strike at the heart\r\nof the whole community of nations and peoples that\r\nembraces the United Nations and the values for which\r\nit stands.\r\nBut they failed in their purpose. Instead, their\r\nbarbarous acts roused in all of us a common will to\r\nrespond. Rather than divide us, they united us. And\r\nunited we intend to respond to every new threat to\r\nworld security.\r\nThe fight against terrorism is the crucial\r\nchallenge we must face today in order to defend human\r\nvalues  the values of freedom, peace, justice and\r\ndevelopment which we all share.\r\nThe United Nations is at the forefront of this\r\nstruggle. We know that it will be a long and hard battle,\r\nand we must therefore maintain the cohesion and\r\ndetermination that we have shown so far.\r\nBut we are firmly convinced that this battle can\r\nbe won. Yesterday President Bush recalled the\r\nresponsibilities that we all share in this fight to defend\r\nfreedom, which is the greatest good and that from\r\nwhich all other goods flow. Terrorism finds a breeding\r\nground wherever there is no freedom, wherever there is\r\nno democracy, but where there is hunger, misery and\r\ndespair.\r\nIn order to defeat terrorism, we must globalize\r\nfreedom and democracy. In order to eradicate\r\nterrorism, we must promote an economic development\r\nwithout borders  a lasting development for all.\r\nMy country has played a role in this struggle\r\nfrom the start and will continue to do so to the end,\r\nenhancing the military, financial, judicial, police and\r\nintelligence cooperation that has already achieved\r\nimportant results. But we are also working to eradicate\r\npoverty and disease. We are committed to pledging\r\n0.39 per cent of our gross domestic product to less\r\ndeveloped countries, and we intend to reach the level\r\nof 0.7 per cent.\r\nThe African continent is crucial to our effort. It is\r\na challenge to our conscience and represents a test of\r\nour ability to help its countries to participate in a true\r\ndevelopment without borders.\r\nThe Group of Eights action plan for Africa,\r\nlaunched in Genoa under Italys presidency and\r\napproved in Canada, responds to the need for a new\r\nform of solidarity between the most industrialized\r\ncountries and those which intend to become the owners\r\nof their future.\r\nBut an increase in financial aid is no longer\r\nenough. At the Kananaskis summit, we presented an\r\naction plan aimed at achieving common standards of\r\ngood governance, starting with our e-government\r\ninitiative, a completely computerized and digitalized\r\nuniversal model of public accounting and of public\r\nadministration and its primary functions.\r\nThe adoption of this universal model, which\r\nrespects the identity, traditions and culture of each\r\ncountry, could produce several positive effects: clear\r\nand transparent public accounting; clear laws and\r\nregulations befitting the rule of law; more efficient\r\nservices for citizens and businesses; greater efficiency\r\nin public administration; and, above all, greater\r\ndemocracy. This will spark a virtuous circle, and donor\r\ncountries will finally have the certainty that their\r\nassistance is truly delivered to needy populations.\r\nIn this respect, three phases were outlined at the\r\nGroup of Eight meeting. In the first trial stage, the\r\nnecessary assistance will be provided to the countries\r\nthat wish to adopt this system. At the end of this phase,\r\nwhich might last three or four years, we can move on\r\nto a second phase in which the adoption of the\r\nuniversal system becomes a requirement for all\r\ncountries that apply for development assistance.\r\nFinally, there could be a third phase in which we\r\ncould ask the most industrialized countries to forge a\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nspecial partnership with specific countries, taking it\r\nupon themselves to implement specific projects.\r\nWe are likewise convinced that public assistance\r\nshould be supplemented by private assistance. At\r\nKananaskis, we submitted an innovative proposal\r\ncalled de-tax, whereby private citizens would be able\r\nto allocate between 1 and 2 per cent of the price of\r\nwhat they buy to the implementation of specific\r\nprojects, such as schools, hospitals or water-supply\r\nfacilities in poor countries.\r\nAt Genoa we also launched the Education for\r\nAll plan and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, to which Italy has pledged a\r\nsubstantial contribution.\r\nBut the poorer countries also need to be relieved\r\nof the burden of their debt so as to free up the\r\nresources they need for their growth. That is why Italy\r\nhas already cancelled $1 billion of debt and will soon\r\ncancel another $4 billion, until the complete write-off\r\nof all its credits.\r\nOur commitment to the United Nations is clear on\r\nall fronts. Italy is the sixth-largest contributor to the\r\nOrganizations regular budget and one of the largest\r\ntroop contributors. About 10,000 Italian soldiers are\r\ndeployed throughout the world, from the Balkans to\r\nAfghanistan, to preserve and maintain peace and\r\nsecurity. We will continue along that road, in our firm\r\nbelief that there is no problem that we cannot solve if\r\nwe are united in our determination.\r\nAs we speak today, the main challenge to the\r\nUnited Nations and our system of values is posed by\r\nthe regime that governs Iraq, which has systematically\r\nignored all the resolutions of the United Nations. A\r\nresponse is indispensable to safeguard the international\r\ncommunity from the danger posed by a massive build-\r\nup of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nAs President Bush so clearly stated, what we\r\nmust address today is precisely this repeated defiance\r\nof the United Nations and of the will of the\r\ninternational community. We must make use of all the\r\ndiplomatic and political means available to address this\r\nsituation. But if things do not change substantially, it\r\nwill be necessary to act within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations in order to safeguard global security\r\nfrom a real threat.\r\nThe lesson we must draw from the events of 11\r\nSeptember is that haste can lead to carelessness, but\r\ndelay in taking the necessary action can have terrible\r\nconsequences. When terrorist attacks or threats to\r\npeace are carried out by networks or regimes that aim\r\nat destroying our way of life and our liberal\r\ndemocracies, then democracies have not only the right\r\nbut also the duty to defend themselves.\r\nLet me now turn our attention to the Middle East.\r\nItaly supports the road map drawn up by the European\r\nUnion, as well as the action of the quartet and the\r\nrapid convening of an international conference to\r\nensure the peaceful coexistence of two independent\r\nStates within safe and secure borders.\r\nFirst of all, the spiral of violence must come to an\r\nend through the cessation of terrorist attacks. The\r\nholding of free and fair elections will advance the\r\nprocess of democratic reform of the Palestinian\r\nNational Authority. But a lasting peace cannot be\r\nenvisaged unless we narrow the economic gap between\r\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians, giving the Palestinians\r\nrealistic hope for jobs and development. With this goal\r\nin mind, Italy has presented a plan to rebuild and\r\nsupport the Palestinian economy. Italy has already\r\noffered to host the negotiations and the peace\r\nconference.\r\nWe are men and women of peace. We are\r\nconvinced that this new century cannot be left at the\r\nmercy of criminal folly and fanaticism. We are\r\ncommitted to the fight against terrorism, and we will\r\ndo everything in our power to eradicate that evil and to\r\ndefend our security and our future. We will lend our\r\nefforts to the building of a true and just peace, the only\r\nkind of peace for the just and the free.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I thank the Prime Minister of the Italian\r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Silvio Berlusconi, Prime Minister of the\r\nItalian Republic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Alexander Downer,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Australia.\r\nMr. Downer (Australia): Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\r\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I\r\nam also pleased to welcome Switzerland as a new\r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nLet me acknowledge also two other significant\r\ndevelopments: the establishment of the African Union,\r\nand the creation of the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment. Both raise real hope for a new era of\r\npolitical stability and economic growth for Africa.\r\nWe meet at this General Assembly in the shadow\r\nof the terrorist attacks on this great city one year ago.\r\nThose chilling events were an attack on the values of\r\nthe great civilizations represented here today, values\r\nthat are central to the United Nations Charter and this\r\nOrganization.\r\nWe can take some comfort in knowing that the\r\ninternational community has responded, deliberately\r\nand resolutely, to international terrorism. The coalition\r\nin the war against terrorism  led by the United States\r\nand joined by others, including Australia  has\r\naccomplished a great deal. The Al Qaeda network in\r\nAfghanistan has been disabled. The Taliban regime has\r\nbeen defeated. Now the world is a safer and more\r\nhumane place.\r\nBut terrorism cannot be stamped out by military\r\neffort alone. Together we must choke off support \r\nfinancial and otherwise  for terrorism. We must stop\r\nthe patrons and bankrollers of the trade in terror, and\r\ntogether face this insidious threat. The decisive\r\nresponse of the United Nations after 11 September,\r\nembodied in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\ncreated a framework for Member States to join forces\r\nin suppressing, prosecuting and punishing terrorist acts\r\nand terrorist financing.\r\nAll Member States must implement the\r\ncommitments made in resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nAustralia has strengthened its counter-terrorism\r\nlegislative and law enforcement framework. We are\r\nparty to 10 of the 12 anti-terrorism instruments and\r\nwill ratify another later this month. Australia is also\r\nassisting other countries in the Asia-Pacific region to\r\nimplement their obligations.\r\nWe face another grave threat to international\r\npeace and security, one that tests the very authority of\r\nthe United Nations. For over a decade, Iraq has flouted\r\nlegally binding obligations to disclose and eradicate its\r\nprogrammes for weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has\r\ndefied United Nations resolutions, United Nations\r\ninspections and United Nations sanctions, and it has\r\nignored some 23 of the 27 United Nations obligations\r\nimposed on it under 16 Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe Secretary-General has been patient, flexible and\r\nassiduous in his efforts to get Iraq to comply with\r\nCouncil resolutions. But Iraq has refused to work with\r\nthe United Nations in efforts to dismantle its\r\nprogrammes for weapons of mass destruction.\r\nUntil this occurs, Iraq is a grave threat to its\r\nneighbours and to the world. Iraqs well documented\r\naggression towards its neighbours and its past use of\r\nchemical weapons underline the potency of the threat it\r\nposes. Grave concerns remain about Iraqs present\r\ncapabilities.\r\nUp until 1998 United Nations weapons inspectors\r\ndid much good work in finding and destroying Iraqs\r\nweapons of mass destruction program. But the work of\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)\r\nwas never finished, because in 1998 the inspectors\r\nwere effectively thrown out of Iraq. Four years later,\r\nthere is little doubt that Iraq has been working hard to\r\nrebuild its chemical and biological weapons\r\nprogrammes. Moreover, serious questions also remain\r\nabout Iraqs nuclear weapons programme.\r\nThis state of affairs cannot be left unresolved.\r\nIraq must give immediate, unconditional and\r\nunrestricted access to inspectors to all areas, facilities,\r\nequipment, records and Iraqi officials. In short, Iraq\r\nmust fulfil the requirements of all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. If Iraq has nothing to hide, then it\r\nhas nothing to fear. Indeed, by meeting these demands,\r\nIraq and its people have everything to gain.\r\nLet us also be very clear: Iraqs flagrant and\r\npersistent defiance is a direct challenge to the United\r\nNations, to the authority of the Security Council, to\r\ninternational law, and to the will of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe cannot stand by and allow ourselves to be\r\nignored. Nor must protracted negotiations be allowed\r\nto weaken and eventually paralyse efforts to allay fears\r\nabout Iraqs weapons of mass destruction. We all must\r\ndemonstrate a clear, collective determination to uphold\r\nthe authority of the Security Council, and to ensure that\r\nits resolutions on Iraq are implemented in full.\r\nOtherwise, if Iraqs pursuit of these abhorrent weapons\r\nis allowed to continue, we may shortly be asking\r\nourselves why we failed to act.\r\nThe terrorist threat has given new urgency to our\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation goals, and puts\r\ndemands on us for a renewed effort to stop the spread\r\nof weapons of mass destruction  both to non-state\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nand state actors. We have to be alive to the willingness\r\nof terrorist groups to develop and use chemical,\r\nbiological or nuclear weapons.\r\nAustralia, for its part, intends to pursue practical\r\nand effective measures through international non-\r\nproliferation treaty regimes and export-control\r\narrangements. These regimes and arrangements have\r\ndelivered tangible security benefits, and should be\r\nsupported strongly.\r\nWe also need to deal with other transnational\r\nchallenges: not just terrorism but other transnational\r\ncrimes, including the smuggling of arms, drugs and\r\npeople.\r\nTransnational crimes threaten all countries. They\r\nrequire us to cooperate further in law enforcement,\r\nintelligence and financial controls  much like the war\r\non terrorism.\r\nPeople-smuggling and trafficking, in particular,\r\nare a truly transnational problem. This lucrative\r\ncriminal enterprise undermines the international\r\nrefugee protection system, and legal migration\r\nprograms, that have enabled millions to build new and\r\nprosperous lives in countries like Australia. Combating\r\npeople-smuggling and trafficking in persons is\r\nparticularly important to Australia and to the Asia-\r\nPacific region. This year, Australia co-hosted a\r\nregional ministerial conference with Indonesia.\r\nMinisters from thirty-eight countries committed\r\nthemselves to stopping the people who deal cold-\r\nheartedly in human cargo. We agreed that, in the first\r\ninstance, people-smuggling must be legislated against\r\nas a serious crime. There is much more we need to do,\r\nand Australia welcomes international discussion and\r\naction on the issue, including within the United\r\nNations system itself.\r\nAustralia welcomes the addition of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court to the international legal\r\nframework. It is an example of positive international\r\ncooperation which will complement the efforts of\r\nStates to end impunity for the worst violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nUnited Nations work in East Timor is another\r\noutstanding example of how the organization can, and\r\ndoes, make a difference  in this case in response to a\r\nhumanitarian crisis. In May we celebrated East Timors\r\nindependence. We are now about to welcome East\r\nTimor as a new member of the United Nations. That we\r\nhave arrived at this point owes much to the resolve and\r\ncourage of the East Timorese. It owes much also to the\r\nUnited Nations and United Nations authorized missions\r\nthat brought stability and order and renewed hope for\r\nthe future.\r\nI congratulate the Secretary-General and the\r\nSecurity Council for providing the United Nations\r\nMission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) with the\r\nnecessary support, not just for peacekeeping and\r\npolicing, but also for developing stable governance in\r\nEast Timor. Sustained United Nations and international\r\nsupport will be critical in East Timors formative years.\r\nAustralia is determined to provide such support. I\r\nwould like to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mellos\r\nefforts in East Timor, and to congratulate him warmly\r\non his appointment as United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nHIV/AIDS is a global issue that tears at the fabric\r\nof our society, and threatens the economic development\r\nof entire continents. The United Nations General\r\nAssembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June last\r\nyear brought home to Member States their\r\nresponsibilities to marshal national and regional\r\nresponses to HIV/AIDS. Australia hosted a regional\r\nministerial meeting in Melbourne in October 2001.\r\nMinisters agreed on the need to develop strategies to\r\nfight HIV/AIDS, and on the need to share lessons and\r\ncooperate in priority areas. We helped establish the\r\nAsia-Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS and\r\nDevelopment to engender greater cooperation in the\r\nregion, and we applaud the appointment of a United\r\nNations regional envoy for HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe United Nations has a heavy agenda. But it\r\ncannot  and should not  try to do everything. To\r\nmake a difference it must be selective and focused,\r\nmatching its activities to its capabilities and to the\r\npriorities that we, the Member States, set for it. The\r\nMillennium Declaration gave us clear, agreed\r\npriorities. And the Monterrey Financing for\r\nDevelopment Conference and the Johannesburg\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development have built on\r\nthese, giving us a framework to shape and direct our\r\nwork. We also need to revitalize and reform the way in\r\nwhich the key organs of the Organization  the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council,\r\nthe Security Council  function. The Security\r\nCouncil, in particular, should be reformed, including by\r\nexpanding its membership.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nWe also need to think again about the relationship\r\nbetween these organs and the Secretariat: time is not a\r\nfree good, nor are meeting services, nor are the\r\nSecretary-Generals reports, and nor is the capacity or\r\nwill of Member States to provide resources without\r\nlimits. We need to look at how we can more effectively\r\nuse existing Unite Nations mechanisms  particularly\r\nthe General Assembly and the United Nations\r\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC)  as bodies\r\nof review. And we are especially concerned that major\r\nUnited Nations conferences have become so large and\r\nunwieldy that their fundamental purposes have been\r\nobscured.\r\nAustralia strongly supports the process of reform\r\nproposed by the Secretary-General for his second term.\r\nThis provides a unique opportunity to address these\r\nquestions and to re-tool the Organization so as to\r\nbuild on its strengths. As Member States, we are the\r\nUnited Nations. The Organization is there to serve our\r\ncollective interests.\r\nIn order to address new threats and challenges,\r\nthe United Nations must be focused and responsive,\r\nand its key organs must function efficiently and\r\neffectively. We must continue to work together to\r\nenable it to meet our expectations. I am confident\r\nthat  together  we can achieve success.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Joseph Deiss, the Federal Councillor and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Switzerland.\r\nMr. Deiss (Switzerland) (spoke in French): It is\r\nimperative, now more than ever before, that all the\r\npeoples of the world act in a spirit of solidarity. The\r\nUnited Nations embodies this spirit. In joining the\r\nUnited Nations, Switzerland sends you a message of\r\nsolidarity. This makes me proud and happy.\r\nI would like to add my thanks to those expressed\r\nlast Tuesday by Kaspar Villiger, the President of the\r\nSwiss Confederation, on the occasion of Switzerlands\r\nformal admission to the United Nations. I would also\r\nlike to thank all the Members of the United Nations for\r\nthe warm welcome they have given my country.\r\nSwitzerland feels welcomed. We feel that we are where\r\nwe belong.\r\nI would also like to give Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan my profound thanks. His sincerity and wisdom\r\ncontributed greatly to convincing the people of\r\nSwitzerland of the need to join the United Nations.\r\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection. I already know and value your qualities and\r\ntalents and I know that you will put them to the best\r\nservice of the United Nations. Switzerland is pleased to\r\nbe working with you towards the success of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Swiss people have decided to join the United\r\nNations. They have said yes to increased cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations. They have said yes to a\r\nstronger international commitment. They have said\r\nyes to taking greater responsibility for meeting the\r\nchallenges that face humankind.\r\nThe challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity at the beginning of the twenty-first century\r\nare immense. A number of regions suffer from terrible\r\npoverty. Crises and wars are rife on all continents.\r\nThere are millions of refugees. We see the hideous face\r\nof terrorism. Criminal networks exploit human beings\r\nand traffic shamefully in drugs and arms. New diseases\r\nare emerging and, day after day, we continue to destroy\r\nthe Earths ecological balance.\r\nThere are no simple answers to any of these\r\nproblems, but there is a place where we can all meet to\r\nfind solutions: the United Nations. The world needs a\r\nstrong United Nations, as it is the only universal\r\nOrganization working at the global level. It alone can\r\nanalyse problems at the world level. It alone can create\r\na consensus between States on common goals. Finally,\r\nas stressed by the Secretary-General, there is no\r\nsubstitute for the unique international legitimacy\r\nprovided to principles and choices of action by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nSwitzerland has joined the United Nations as a\r\nneutral country and we intend to remain neutral. Our\r\nneutral status, however, in no way diminishes our\r\ndesire for cooperation. On the contrary, it is an\r\nadvantage for our peace activities. Our membership of\r\nthe United Nations is not a change in direction, but the\r\nlogical consequence of our foreign policy.\r\nTo quote our Constitution, the Swiss\r\nConfederation is committed  to a just and peaceful\r\ninternational order. The principal aim of the United\r\nNations is to maintain international peace and security.\r\nFor us, therefore, the United Nations is the ideal place\r\nto carry out this vital mission. As a Member of the\r\nUnited Nations, Switzerland will devote itself\r\nresolutely to international peace and security. That\r\ncommitment will be focused, above all, on armed\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nconflicts. The logic of armed conflicts today forces us\r\nto adopt a multidimensional approach to peace\r\nprocesses. If we are to succeed, we must work in\r\nseveral different areas in parallel: military, diplomatic,\r\nhumanitarian and economic. We must also involve all\r\ninterested players in the process. All this demands a\r\nmajor effort of coordination, and Switzerland will\r\ncontribute to that.\r\nSecurity problems, moreover, must be addressed\r\nfrom a broader angle  that of human security. The\r\ninhabitants of this world must be able to live without\r\nfear of war, starvation and despotism. In particular, we\r\nmust protect vulnerable individuals and groups.\r\nSwitzerland will therefore pursue its efforts in favour\r\nof human security. This includes stopping the\r\nrecruitment of child soldiers, eliminating anti-\r\npersonnel mines and halting the proliferation of small\r\narms.\r\nIn this context, I welcome the Secretary-\r\nGenerals appeal to make full use of multilateral\r\ninstitutions. This is especially valid for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. There\r\nis only one source of legitimacy for the use of force:\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIraq has been discussed on several occasions\r\nduring these past days. There is undeniably a need to\r\nact, and to act with determination, in order to ensure\r\nthe implementation of United Nations resolutions, but\r\naction must be taken together, within the United\r\nNations. Only the United Nations can confer\r\ninternational legitimacy to any action against Iraq.\r\nSwitzerland is convinced that peace and\r\ndevelopment can be sustained only if they go hand in\r\nhand with freedom, democracy, and respect for human\r\nrights. Human dignity is our most precious asset. It\r\nmust be defended at all times and in all places. We will\r\nchampion this conviction at the United Nations to the\r\nfull and without concessions. For as long as men and\r\nwomen are exploited, children are mistreated and the\r\ndeath penalty is carried out, Switzerland will do\r\neverything within its power to defend human dignity.\r\nAt the General Assembly this year, we will strive\r\nin particular to promote the adoption of the draft\r\noptional protocol to the United Nations Convention\r\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\r\nTreatment or Punishment. This protocol is needed to\r\ngive better protection to people in detention against\r\ntorture and mistreatment. That is why we have been\r\nsupporting this initiative for years.\r\nIn its capacity as the Depositary State,\r\nSwitzerland feels a special responsibility to promote\r\nawareness of and respect for the Geneva Conventions\r\nand their Additional Protocols. At the United Nations,\r\nwe will continue tirelessly to defend these instruments.\r\nIn this area, Switzerland has submitted to a number of\r\ncountries involved in the Middle East conflict a\r\nproposal which aims to ensure the better\r\nimplementation of international humanitarian law. We\r\nadvocate two mechanisms: one for promoting dialogue\r\nto allow the parties to settle problems concerning the\r\napplication of international humanitarian law; the\r\nsecond, a mechanism to monitor respect for\r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nWe are also convinced that the International\r\nCriminal Court will ensure the better application of\r\ninternational humanitarian law. This new Court is an\r\nessential tool for dealing with serious violations of the\r\nfundamental human freedoms. We will therefore\r\nremain on our guard to ensure that it can function\r\nefficiently and we will pursue our efforts to convince\r\nthose States that have not yet signed the Rome Statute\r\nof the need for such a Court.\r\nTwo days ago, we commemorated the tragic\r\nevents that shook the United States and the world one\r\nyear ago. The causes of terrorism must be eradicated. I\r\nam thinking, inter alia, of injustice, disregard for the\r\nrights of minorities, and poverty. That is one of the\r\nobjectives of our development cooperation and of our\r\nhuman rights policy.\r\nSustainable development and the elimination of\r\npoverty remain mankinds main challenges today. We\r\nsaw that again at Johannesburg. They are global\r\nchallenges that require a global strategy and global\r\nsolidarity. In other words, they require coordinated\r\naction by the United Nations institutions, as well as\r\ngreater cooperation between the United Nations, the\r\ndevelopment banks, civil society and the private sector.\r\nDevelopment cooperation must be coordinated.\r\nSwitzerland will contribute to strengthening the\r\ncoordination efforts vital to ensuring that our activities\r\nenjoy the success they merit.\r\nThe struggle against poverty also requires greater\r\nexchange of expertise and better transfer of technology.\r\nSwitzerland is closely involved in the preparation of\r\nthe World Summit on the Information Society, the first\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.4\r\nphase of which will take place in Geneva in 2003. The\r\nmain challenge of that Summit is the very gap between\r\nNorth and South in terms of access to new information\r\ntechnologies. Therefore, I call on all to contribute\r\nactively to the success of that conference.\r\nThese thoughts lead me to refer to Geneva, the\r\ninternational city that is a close and longstanding link\r\nbetween my country and the United Nations.\r\nSwitzerland is proud and grateful to be able to host the\r\nEuropean Headquarters of the United Nations and\r\nmany specialized agencies. Geneva is the main\r\ninternational hub of disarmament, humanitarian aid,\r\nsocial development, the promotion of human rights and\r\nenvironmental protection. That gives me great\r\npleasure, because Swiss citizens are particularly\r\nconcerned about these issues. However, that also\r\ninvolves the special responsibility of offering\r\ninternational organizations optimum working and\r\nliving conditions. You can also count on Switzerland in\r\nthat area.\r\nBefore Switzerland became a Member, the United\r\nNations was already a universal Organization, but with\r\nSwitzerland  and soon Timor-Leste  the United\r\nNations will be even more universal. The United\r\nNations is the greatest world forum. Switzerland will\r\nprovide it its full support in the interests of humanity\r\nand the interests of we, the peoples of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n"
