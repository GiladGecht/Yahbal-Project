I would like to begin by thanking the\r\nSecretary-General for the presentation of the report we\r\nare now considering.\r\nThe recent history of Central America is a living\r\nexample of the timeliness and soundness of the\r\nfundamental principles of the United Nations. Twenty\r\nyears ago, when the General Assembly considered this\r\nitem for the first time, our region had plunged into a\r\ndeep political, economic and military crisis. Some\r\ncountries had domestic strife. Large Powers were vying\r\nfor control of the region. Various armed groups tried to\r\nseize power. There were hundreds of thousands of\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. Innumerable\r\nviolations of human rights were committed. Illicit\r\ntrafficking in arms endangered the entire region.\r\nAt that time, the main concern of the international\r\ncommunity was to stop the armed conflict. Twenty\r\nyears later, the situation could not be more different.\r\nThe region is at peace now. Democracy has been\r\nconsolidated. Only last year, free elections were held in\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. All of our\r\nnations have undergone very deep-rooted political\r\ntransformations, as well as economic and social\r\nchanges, with a view to promoting economic\r\ndevelopment and building more democratic, more just\r\nand more equitable societies. Fundamental rights are\r\nbeing fully observed.\r\nToday, each one of our countries has a human\r\nrights defender. This radical improvement is due, above\r\nall, to the very strong commitment of our peoples and\r\nGovernments to peace, democracy and respect for\r\nhuman dignity.\r\nThe progress achieved, however, would have\r\nbeen impossible without the continuous political and\r\neconomic support of the international community in\r\ngeneral and of this Organization in particular. In the\r\nlast two decades, all of the human development\r\nindices — life span, literacy rate, level of education\r\nand gross domestic product (GDP) per capita — have\r\nsystematically improved. At the current time, our\r\nGovernments are committed to continually improving\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nthese indices through the implementation of social\r\nprogrammes aimed at alleviating poverty and\r\nunemployment, improving public security,\r\nstrengthening the judicial system, consolidating public\r\nadministration and fighting corruption. Our\r\nGovernments are, inter alia, making renewed efforts to\r\ncombat common crime and transnational organized\r\ncrime, which in recent years have menaced the security\r\nof our citizens.\r\nOver the last two decades, our region has enjoyed\r\nsome periods of economic growth. However, in the past\r\nyear our economies have deteriorated due to an\r\nunfavourable international economic climate and to a\r\nfall in exports. Regrettably, our economies continue to\r\nbe highly sensitive to fluctuations in world markets.\r\nFor that reason and to ensure sustainable economic\r\ndevelopment in the region, our countries are\r\nnegotiating a series of trade agreements with our\r\ncounterparts outside the region. As well, our countries\r\nare making significant efforts to adapt, strengthen and\r\nfurther boost the process of Central American\r\nintegration, especially in the economic, social, cultural\r\nand tourism sectors.\r\nOur Governments have committed themselves to\r\ncombating the availability of, and traffic in, small\r\narms. A regional meeting was recently held in San\r\nJosé, Costa Rica, to coordinate implementation of the\r\nProgramme of Action adopted at the United Nations\r\nConference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and\r\nLight Weapons in All Its Aspects. At the conclusion of\r\nthe San José meeting, a plan was adopted for national\r\nand regional implementation of that Programme of\r\nAction.\r\nIn the area of the environment, our countries are\r\ncarrying out efforts to consolidate the Meso-American\r\nBiological Corridor. The Corridor consists of a system\r\nof natural areas under special administration, multiple-\r\nuse areas and interconnecting areas; its purpose is to\r\nprotect biodiversity and to contribute to the quality of\r\nlife of the inhabitants.\r\nUnfortunately, Central America is highly\r\nvulnerable to natural disasters. In recent years, we have\r\nbeen the victim of the devastating hurricanes Mitch,\r\nKeith and Michelle, the earthquakes in El Salvador in\r\nJanuary 2001 and a drought that afflicted the entire\r\nregion. Those natural disasters caused the loss of many\r\nhuman lives and substantial material losses. In\r\nresponse to those disasters, our Governments adopted a\r\nseries of measures to reduce risks and to minimize the\r\neffects of natural disasters. Among them are the\r\nadoption of the Strategic Framework for the Reduction\r\nof Vulnerability and Disasters in Central America and\r\nthe Central American Five-Year Plan for the Reduction\r\nof Vulnerability to and the Impact of Disasters, 2000-\r\n2004.\r\nWithout doubt, the situation in Central America\r\nhas improved substantially in the last two decades.\r\nHowever, the process has not yet been completed. We\r\nmust now consolidate the achievements made and must\r\ncontinue to make progress in the building of societies\r\nthat are more just, democratic and peaceful. We trust\r\nthat, on this new path, we will be able to continue to\r\ncount on the support of the international community,\r\nincluding the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to the draft\r\nresolution on this subject, issued today in document\r\nA/57/L.20. As the principal sponsor, my delegation\r\nwelcomes any suggestions for the improvement of this\r\ntext and invites all other delegations to join the list of\r\nsponsors. If necessary, we will request the publication\r\nof a revised version.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMexico shares solid historic, cultural and geographic\r\nlinks with the Central American countries and gives\r\nhigh priority to its bilateral relations with each of them,\r\nas well as with the region as a whole. The Government\r\nof Mexico has systematically supported the\r\nGovernments and the peoples of Central America in\r\ntheir efforts to achieve peace and national\r\nreconciliation, to strengthen their democratic\r\ninstitutions and to achieve post-conflict social and\r\neconomic development. That support is reflected in the\r\ngreat number of concrete bilateral and regional\r\ncooperation activities in the political, scientific and\r\ntechnical, cultural and educational and economic areas,\r\nas well as in emergency humanitarian assistance.\r\nWith respect to regional cooperation, my\r\ndelegation wishes to mention the fifth summit of the\r\nTuxtla dialogue and coordination mechanism, held in\r\nJune of this year in Mérida, Mexico. On that occasion,\r\nheads of State or Government of Central America and\r\nMexico adopted the Mérida Declaration, whose main\r\ngoal is to create a Meso-American community of\r\nnations as a means of achieving greater levels of well-\r\nbeing and sustainable development in the region,\r\nwithin a framework of democracy, respect for human\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nrights and sustained and permanent peace. The leaders,\r\ninter alia, affirmed their support for the Puebla-Panama\r\nPlan, a proposal by Mexico to promote economic\r\ndevelopment, with a sustainable regional vision for\r\nstrengthening communication links in Central America,\r\nin particular the southern part of my country. As well,\r\nMexico has actively participated in regional efforts to\r\ncreate the Meso-American Biological Corridor.\r\nThe armed conflicts in Central America have now\r\nbeen overcome. However, a sustained effort is still\r\nrequired of the Governments and the peoples of Central\r\nAmerica, with the sustained support of the international\r\ncommunity, to fully meet the commitments of the peace\r\nagreements and so that the root causes of those\r\nconflicts can be dealt with effectively. In that context,\r\nthe role of the United Nations has been — and must\r\ncontinue to be — fundamental.\r\nWe have carefully studied the latest report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the situation in Central America\r\n(A/57/384) and the specific reports on Guatemala\r\n(A/57/584) and on the work of the United Nations\r\nVerification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA)\r\n(A/57/336). One can see from the latter two reports\r\nthat, although there has been some progress in meeting\r\nthe commitments entered into under the peace\r\nagreements, much remains to be done to achieve a\r\nsolid, lasting and irreversible peace in Guatemala. In\r\nparticular, we are concerned at the increase in human\r\nrights violations, a situation that without doubt\r\ndiminishes Guatemalans’ hopes for the peace process.\r\nMexico considers that the presence of\r\nMINUGUA in Guatemala has been very positive; it has\r\ncontributed certainty and reliability to the\r\nimplementation of the peace agreements. This function\r\nhas been broadly recognized by all political parties and\r\nby civil society and the people of Guatemala. This is\r\nwhy my Government, which has been fully committed\r\nto the peace process in Guatemala from the very outset,\r\nsupports the request of the Government of Guatemala\r\nthat the Mission continue as part of this process until\r\nthe end of 2004, bearing in mind the election period\r\nthat is approaching and the governmental transition\r\nthat is scheduled for 2004. In this respect, my\r\ndelegation notes with satisfaction the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the renewal of the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA), which recommends extending that\r\nmandate until 31 December 2003, pursuant to a\r\nprevious agreement. It also mentions the intention of\r\nthe Secretary-General to begin consultations with\r\nMember States of the Organization concerning the\r\nrequest from Guatemala.\r\nMy delegation believes that an extension of the\r\nmandate of the Mission beyond 2003 should be agreed\r\non, while we clearly establish which tasks the\r\nGovernment of Guatemala needs to carry out in order\r\nto consolidate the peace process.\r\nWe are in consultation with Member States,\r\nespecially with friends of the peace process, with\r\nrespect to the draft resolution on the renewal of the\r\nmandate of MINUGUA, which traditionally has been\r\nintroduced by my delegation. I am confident that in the\r\ncoming days we will be able to distribute and submit\r\nthe text and we hope that text will be adopted by\r\nconsensus.\r\nConcerning consolidation of peace in El\r\nSalvador, my Government acknowledges the efforts of\r\nthe Government of El Salvador in fulfilling the final\r\ncommitments under the peace agreement so that the\r\nUnited Nations might conclude its work of verification\r\nof that process before the end of this year. In this\r\nregard, Mexico welcomes the measures adopted by the\r\nGovernment of El Salvador in order that the fund for\r\nthe war victims is adequately established. As the\r\nheadquarters of the peace agreement a decade ago and\r\na friend of the peace process, Mexico supports the\r\naspiration of the Government of El Salvador to end this\r\nperiod in a successful way and as quickly as possible.\r\nLikewise, the Government of Mexico is\r\nencouraged by the efforts undertaken by the\r\nGovernments of Guatemala and Belize within the\r\nOrganization of American States to find a solution to\r\nthe territorial dispute between those two countries. This\r\nis an example for the region and shows again that\r\ndifferences of this nature can be solved through\r\nnegotiation.\r\nTo conclude, let me reiterate the commitment\r\nmade by my Government to work actively with each\r\none of the brother countries of the region for the sake\r\nof long-lasting peace and sustainable development.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): It\r\nis my honour to express the appreciation of my\r\ndelegation to the Secretary-General for the presentation\r\nof the report on the situation in Central America, as\r\nwell as the thirteenth report on human rights of the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\n(MINUGUA). The contribution made by the United\r\nNations in Central America during the last decade has\r\nled to important achievements that are reflected in the\r\ngrowing strength of the democratic institutions and the\r\nconsolidation of peace, as well as the promotion and\r\nrespect for human rights in Central America. The\r\nreport on the situation in Central America mentions all\r\nof this and this is why I would like to point out that\r\nthese results have led to a visible improvement in the\r\nliving conditions in large areas of Central America\r\npreviously afflicted by long years of armed conflict and\r\nwhose current and future populations, especially those\r\nwho belong to the most vulnerable sectors, can now\r\nlook to the future with promise.\r\nTwo decades have already passed since we began\r\nthe peace process in Central America and indeed from\r\nthe very outset Colombia was permanently attentive to\r\nthe unfolding of that process, not as a passive observer\r\nbut as a friendly country profoundly interested in\r\nstimulating and supporting a firm and long lasting\r\npeace. It might seem paradoxical that a nation like\r\nmine, which has been confronting a domestic conflict\r\nfor over four decades now, is trying at the same time to\r\nfind solutions to achieve peace in other areas. But\r\nreality has shown that accompanying others during a\r\npeace process enriches one’s own vision of peace and\r\nallows us to complement the efforts of others and the\r\napplication of models that have some elements in\r\ncommon within their individual conditions and\r\nrealities. So please allow me to reiterate the very strong\r\ncommitment of my country to the consolidation of a\r\nlong-lasting peace in Central America, faced with the\r\nneed to promote profound transformations that will\r\nlead to economic and social development in the region.\r\nColombia, as a member of the group of friends of\r\nGuatemala, recognizes the very strong efforts made by\r\nour brother country, Guatemala, in fulfilling the\r\nconditions of the peace agreement, as well as the\r\npreponderant role that MINUGUA has played in this.\r\nContinuing the presence of MINUGUA in Guatemala\r\nmeans an essential guarantee to reach the objectives\r\nthat have been proposed since the peace was signed.\r\nColombia believes in the commitment of the people\r\nand Government of Guatemala to fulfil the peace\r\nagreement conditions. This is why we support the\r\nrequest to extend the mandate of MINUGUA beginning\r\n1 January 2003.\r\nConcerning El Salvador, we would highlight the\r\nefforts that have led the Government to conclude its\r\nfulfilment of the peace agreement, which means a true\r\nadvance toward new stages of coexistence and progress\r\nin this country. As a member of the group of friends of\r\nthe Secretary-General, we would likewise reiterate the\r\nneed to have the Secretary-General formalize the final\r\nmoment of verification here. If we do not have this\r\nfinal touch, we will be maintaining a situation of\r\nuncertainty for no good reason.\r\nMr. Flores (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nrepresentative of Denmark spoke earlier on behalf of\r\nthe European Union, and my delegation fully supports\r\nhis statement. Nevertheless, in the light of the very\r\nclose ties that bind my country to the region, and\r\nbecause Spain belongs to the Group of Friends of\r\nCentral America and Guatemala, I should like to make\r\nsome additional remarks.\r\nSpain is pleased that the political and economic\r\ndialogue between the European Union and Central\r\nAmerica is continuing to make headway, as was\r\nconfirmed by the Ministerial Conference held last May\r\nat Madrid under the presidency of Spain. At that\r\nConference, the countries of the region made a\r\ncommitment to consolidate integration, democracy and\r\nsocial and economic advances. Spain will continue,\r\nboth within the European Union and in other forums, to\r\nmake every effort to support those objectives.\r\nThe progress made in the negotiations on the\r\nterritorial dispute between Guatemala and Belize, the\r\nefforts undertaken by President Bolaños of Nicaragua,\r\nand, above all, the tenth anniversary of the signing of\r\nthe El Salvador peace agreements, which we will\r\ncommemorate this year, give us considerable grounds\r\nfor hope in this respect. However, a great deal remains\r\nto be done.\r\nSpain would like at the outset to thank the\r\nSecretary-General for the quality and timeliness of the\r\nreports submitted by the United Nations Verification\r\nMission in Guatemala (MINUGUA), whose regional\r\ndeployment is playing an especially effective role in\r\nthe follow-up to the implementation of the peace\r\nagreements in Guatemala.\r\nIn this respect, however, we note with regret the\r\noverall deterioration of the situation in the country this\r\npast year, especially in the area of human rights, as was\r\nnoted by the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mrs. Hilani.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nOur country views with deep concern the\r\ncontinuing threats and extortion attempts against\r\npersons and institutions working for the defence of\r\nhuman rights; the lack of progress made on the\r\nAgreement on the Identity and Rights of Indigenous\r\nPeoples; and the re-emergence of civil defence patrols.\r\nWe are particularly concerned at the growing climate of\r\nimpunity, as was evidenced by the overturning of the\r\nGerardi convictions and the legal problems related to\r\nthe application of the death penalty, the promised\r\nmoratorium on which has not yet been implemented.\r\nSpain is nevertheless confident that the\r\ncommitment undertaken by President Portillo before\r\nthe General Assembly last September with respect to\r\nthe implementation of all aspects of the peace\r\nagreements will become a reality. Our country is aware\r\nof the efforts made by President Portillo to promote\r\nnational reconciliation, which have led to recent\r\nlegislative advances in specific areas, such as\r\ndecentralization and racial discrimination. Our\r\nGovernment supports those fully.\r\nThroughout this process, MINUGUA has\r\nprovided invaluable assistance. Spain deems it\r\nadvisable that next year the Mission draw up a\r\ntransition plan identifying the Guatemalan institutions\r\nand organizations that would take over MINUGUA’s\r\nfunctions. Given this necessary transition and the fact\r\nthat general elections will be held in the country at the\r\nend of the next year, Spain would suggest an extension\r\nof MINUGUA’s mandate beyond the end of 2003,\r\nalong with a gradual reduction of its staff, with a view\r\nto facilitating the transition process and ensuring the\r\ninitial stability of the incoming Government.\r\nMr. Lagos Pizzati (El Salvador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The item on the situation in Central America\r\nhas been under consideration by the General Assembly\r\nsince 1983, at a time when the region was in the throes\r\nof a political crisis. Internal conflicts in certain\r\ncountries had not only led to instability and\r\nconfrontation within and among the countries of the\r\nregion, but had also become a factor for confrontation\r\nwithin the context of the cold war — a situation that\r\nwas in turn negatively affecting the economic and\r\nsocial development of the peoples of Central America.\r\nToday, nearly two decades later, we are pleased at\r\nthe positive outcome of the efforts deployed to address\r\nthe situation: the decision of the Central American\r\nGovernments to shoulder their responsibilities towards\r\ntheir peoples; the assistance of the United Nations; and\r\nthe solidarity, support and cooperation of the\r\ninternational community, in particular that of friendly\r\ncountries, all of which have an interest in seeing peace\r\nand stability take root in Central America.\r\nThe positive evolution of the situation in Central\r\nAmerica has been reflected annually in the reports\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General on that item, in\r\nparticular since 1987, when the General Assembly\r\nexpressed its support for the agreement on “Procedure\r\nfor the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in\r\nCentral America”, signed on 7 August 1987, and\r\nrequested the Secretary-General to provide his support\r\nand good offices to the Governments of the region to\r\nachieve those objectives — a mandate that was fully\r\nreaffirmed and supported by the Security Council in\r\n1989. Those resolutions became the basis for a greater\r\ninvolvement on the part of the United Nations in the\r\nquest to resolve Central American problems.\r\nThe complex and difficult process of\r\npeacemaking in Central America has led to substantive\r\nchanges that have benefited the peoples of the region,\r\nwhich today enjoy greater freedom and democracy and\r\nwhose human rights and fundamental freedoms are\r\nbetter safeguarded. In the economic and social fields,\r\nGovernments are working to expand opportunities from\r\nthe perspective of human-centred national development\r\nprogrammes.\r\nHowever, as the Secretary-General stated in his\r\nmost recent report on the situation in Central America,\r\nit must be noted that the peoples and the Governments\r\nof the region continue to face serious challenges,\r\nwhich, although they are not exclusive to our countries,\r\nmust be addressed with the same intensity and priority\r\nthat were accorded to the resolution of the Central\r\nAmerican crisis and of the internal conflicts. This will\r\nenable us to avoid any delay in achieving our goals and\r\nto take advantage of our resources and our potential, in\r\norder to continue to promote the development and\r\nconsolidation of the democratic institutions — those\r\nresulting from the peace process as well as others —\r\nthat are necessary to enhance the quality of life of our\r\npeoples.\r\nThe support of the United Nations and of the\r\ninternational community will be pivotal in this respect,\r\nbecause while we must continue to combat those\r\nstructural factors that led to the political and military\r\ncrisis, we are doing so with limited financial and\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nnatural resources, dealing all the while with the\r\nconsequences of natural disasters. It will always be\r\nhelpful for our own efforts to be complemented by\r\nassistance, in order to minimize not only the region’s\r\nvulnerability to the forces of nature but also the\r\nnegative conditions resulting from an international\r\neconomic environment that is affecting the primary\r\neconomies of the countries of the region, and in order\r\nto consolidate the objectives of peace, freedom,\r\ndemocracy and development.\r\nI should like to refer to a specific aspect of the\r\nsituation of my country that is linked to the\r\nimplementation of the Peace Agreements.\r\nDuring the 1980s — a period that could be called\r\nthe “lost decade”, as far as the political, economic and\r\nsocial development of our people is concerned — El\r\nSalvador was involved in an internal armed conflict\r\nthat fortunately came to an end with the signing of the\r\nEl Salvador Peace Agreements on 16 January 1992.\r\nThe implementation of the provisions of those\r\nAgreements was verified and monitored by the United\r\nNations — a process that began even earlier, in 1991,\r\nwhen the United Nations began a limited operation to\r\nverify the San José Agreement on Human Rights,\r\nwhich was subsequently incorporated into the Peace\r\nAgreements.\r\nThe transition from war to peace provided a\r\nstimulus for the Salvadoran people. During that\r\ntransition period they had to fully implement all of the\r\ncommitments undertaken in the Peace Agreements and\r\nset out again on the path towards normal living\r\nconditions, free from the fear and violence that had\r\nprofoundly affected all elements of society.\r\nWe firmly believe — and our conviction is shared\r\nby friendly countries that directly participated in or\r\nclosely followed the development of the peace process\r\nin El Salvador — that by the tenth anniversary of the\r\nsigning of the Peace Agreements, on 16 January this\r\nyear, the commitments and obligations set out in those\r\nAgreements had been fully discharged.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s comments that we have reached the final\r\nstage of the United Nations verification process in El\r\nSalvador. This can now be formalized with the\r\nconfirmation of the commitment to the efficient and\r\neffective functioning of the Fund for the Wounded and\r\nWar-Disabled — the final outstanding issue relating to\r\nthe verification process.\r\nIt is important to reaffirm the political will shown\r\nby the Government of El Salvador during the entire\r\nprocess of implementing of the Peace Agreements and\r\nto provide information about the measures taken in this\r\nrespect, with the approval by the Republic of a law and\r\nthe consequent allocation of financial resources from\r\nthe national budget for the adequate functioning of the\r\nFund for the Wounded and War-Disabled, which will\r\nprovide assistance to the beneficiaries.\r\nIt should be pointed out — and this is\r\nencouraging — that the report of the Secretary-General\r\nis able to conclude that the situation in El Salvador\r\ncontinues to evolve positively. Although not all of our\r\nproblems have been resolved, there is no doubt that a\r\nvery profound transformation has taken place within\r\nSalvadoran society itself, in particular as a result of the\r\nwill and efforts of the people and the Government of El\r\nSalvador, as well as the interested political forces that\r\nwant to establish a peaceful, democratic, just and\r\nequitable society.\r\nWe would like to stress that we have been able to\r\nrely on the unconditional support of the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations, and we express\r\nheartfelt thanks to them. We would like in particular to\r\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General, as well\r\nas to his predecessors, and to all of the personnel of the\r\nUnited Nations who in one way or another participated\r\nin the verification effort. We are confident that they\r\nwill be able to continue their excellent work where it is\r\nrequired in other parts of the world.\r\nIn conclusion, my Government would like to\r\nreaffirm its steadfast commitment and determination to\r\ncontinue along the road towards the consolidation of a\r\nsociety in harmony — one that works for the economic\r\nand social progress not only of all the people of El\r\nSalvador, but also of the whole of Central America.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMy colleague, Ambassador Bruno Stagno of Costa\r\nRica, has already spoken on behalf of all of the\r\ncountries members of the Central American Integration\r\nSystem and, of course, we fully associate ourselves\r\nwith his statement. I will therefore limit myself to\r\nspeaking exclusively about the situation of Guatemala\r\nand, in particular, the extension of the mandate of the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA).\r\nIn this respect, I would like first of all to thank\r\nthe Secretary-General for having submitted the reports\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\ncontained in documents A/57/384 and A/57/584. I\r\nshould also like to thank the Group of Friends of the\r\npeace process in Guatemala, who, as the representative\r\nof Mexico stated earlier, are preparing a draft\r\nresolution to be introduced shortly at this meeting. I\r\nshould like in particular to acknowledge the work of\r\nthe Permanent Mission of Mexico to the United\r\nNations, whose officials are coordinating the\r\nconsultations on that draft resolution.\r\nIn recent years, at about this time, we have\r\nconsidered the situation in Central America in general\r\nand the situation in Guatemala in particular. As the\r\nAssembly is aware, MINUGUA has been operating in\r\nmy country since 1994. Its original objective was to\r\nverify compliance with an agreement on human rights,\r\nbut its mandate was widened in 1997 to include support\r\nfor parties that had signed the Peace Agreements in\r\nDecember 1996 by carrying out tasks in the areas of\r\nverification, facilitation, public information and good\r\noffices.\r\nThose Agreements are a work in progress,\r\ncharacterized by advances, as well as by shortcomings\r\nand even by setbacks. The presence of MINUGUA in\r\nGuatemala has been a vital element in that process.\r\nSpeaking in this Hall in September during the third\r\nplenary meeting, President Alfonso Portillo paid tribute\r\nto the role of the Mission, calling it the “critical\r\nconscience of the State”.\r\nGiven the delay in the implementation of the\r\nPeace Agreements that became apparent during 2000,\r\nas a result of a number of factors whose origin and\r\nscope are described in the reports that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has periodically submitted to us, it was\r\ndecided that the mandate of MINUGUA should be\r\nextended until the end of 2003, with its functions being\r\nprogressively transferred to national entities or, where\r\npossible, to other United Nations bodies. That process\r\nis now under way, and the size of the Mission has been\r\nprogressively reduced year by year with a view to its\r\nfinal withdrawal.\r\nWe have before us a number of reports of the\r\nSecretary-General that provide an account of the\r\ncurrent status of the implementation of the Peace\r\nAgreements. Among them, I should like to mention the\r\nseventh report on the verification of compliance with\r\nthe peace agreements (A/56/1003); the thirteenth report\r\non human rights (A/57/336); the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on the situation in Central America,\r\nalready cited; the report of the Secretary-General on\r\nthe renewal of the mandate of MINUGUA (A/57/584);\r\nand the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the\r\nreport of Olara Otunnu, his Special Representative for\r\nChildren and Armed Conflict (A/57/402), which\r\ncontains an account of Mr. Otunnu’s visit to Guatemala\r\nfrom 24 to 28 February this year.\r\nTogether, those reports present a mixed picture of\r\nprogress in some areas and of stagnation and even\r\nsetbacks in others. Although we think that some of the\r\nreports — especially that concerning the situation in\r\nCentral America — underestimate the progress, we\r\nrecognize that shortfalls in compliance with the peace\r\nagreements have been accumulating and that many of\r\nthe objectives originally pursued are far from being\r\nattained. Some of the areas in which setbacks have\r\nbeen observed relate precisely to sensitive matters,\r\nsuch as respect for human rights and the strengthening\r\nof civil society.\r\nThis is not the time to apportion blame for the\r\nless than satisfactory picture before us. Certainly, the\r\nGovernment led by President Alfonso Portillo has\r\nacknowledged its share of blame, related less to\r\nintentions than to the implementation of commitments.\r\nIt must also be pointed out that the dynamic of the\r\nprocess has persistently generated resistance on the\r\npart of various pressure groups that have felt\r\nthemselves to be adversely affected by particular\r\nactions. Moreover, in certain circles, recalcitrant\r\nattitudes persist with regard to much-needed\r\nreconciliation. Equally noteworthy are the surrounding\r\ncircumstances: an economy very adversely affected by\r\nexternal factors — particularly by the falling prices of\r\nbasic commodities — that result in high unemployment\r\nand in pressures on public-sector finances. Such\r\npressures make it difficult to meet the financial\r\nimplications of the commitments undertaken.\r\nAt any rate, although all participants in the\r\nprocess have reaffirmed their full alignment with the\r\nagreements, the fact is that many tasks remain\r\noutstanding. They have been organized and\r\nrescheduled by the parties signatory to the process, in\r\nbroad consultation with civil society. The tasks to be\r\naccomplished in the period 1997-2000, and\r\nsubsequently envisaged for the period 2001-2003,\r\napparently will not be completed. But at least it is\r\nintended that they be reinvigorated, as agreed during\r\nthe most recent meeting of the Consultative Group,\r\nheld at Washington in February, whose work is\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nsummarized in two recent reports on progress with\r\nregard to follow-up. For all of those reasons, it is\r\nessential to extend the presence of the Verification\r\nMission.\r\nBut there is more: under the current scheme, the\r\nMission would be withdrawn just as the current\r\nAdministration concludes its term at the end of 2003,\r\nin a transitional period during which it would be\r\ndesirable to maintain a United Nations presence in\r\nGuatemala for an additional year — that is, through\r\n2004 — to ensure that the logic of the peace\r\nagreements continues into the future. That is why,\r\nwhen President Alfonso Portillo addressed the\r\nAssembly on 12 September, during the general debate,\r\nhe pointed out:\r\n“My Government’s term of office will\r\nexpire in a little over a year, by which time the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA) will be planning to withdraw. The\r\nMission has played a fundamental role as the\r\ncritical conscience of the State and has actively\r\nsupported the fundamental changes that have\r\ntaken place. We appreciate the work that it has\r\ndone and we would like here to request the\r\nextension of its mandate to the end of 2004 so\r\nthat it may accompany us as we make the\r\ntransition to a new Administration. Our hope is\r\nthat MINUGUA will hand over its functions in an\r\norderly manner to national bodies and, where\r\nappropriate, to the programmes and agencies of\r\nthe United Nations.” (A/57/PV.3, p. 8)\r\nMoreover, not only the Government is requesting\r\na United Nations presence for a limited additional\r\nperiod. For example, at last month’s intersectoral\r\nroundtable on dialogue, the culture of peace and\r\nreconciliation, chaired by the Archbishop of Guatemala\r\nand attended by more than 200 representatives of civil\r\nsociety organizations, many statements to that effect\r\nwere heard. Along the same lines, Special\r\nRepresentative Olara Otunnu, states in his report, after\r\nnoting what he describes as the very positive effects of\r\nMINUGUA, that there is “widespread concern,\r\nparticularly within civil society, about the plans not to\r\nextend MINUGUA beyond the end of 2003” (A/57/402,\r\npara. 20).\r\nFinally, we are aware of the practical and, above\r\nall, budgetary difficulties that the extension of\r\nMINUGUA would entail. But, I must emphasize that\r\nwe are proposing to extend, not to perpetuate, its\r\npresence. As we have previously pointed out, we\r\naccept the idea of a gradual and progressive reduction\r\nof the Mission’s personnel, followed by its final\r\nwithdrawal. We do not think it would be inconsistent\r\nwith that policy to envisage withdrawal at the end of\r\n2004 rather than of 2003, particularly if we take into\r\naccount the fact that we would be contemplating a very\r\nreduced presence in the final year compared with the\r\nprevious years. Therefore, we trust that the States\r\nmembers of the Assembly will join us in our aspiration,\r\nwhich will enable us to capitalize on the Organization’s\r\nconsiderable investment in effort and resources to\r\nsupport Guatemalans in the consolidation of their\r\nprocess of peace, democracy and development.\r\nMr. Brown (United States): Today we are here to\r\naddress an important item, “The Situation in Central\r\nAmerica: procedures for the establishment of a firm\r\nand lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region\r\nof peace, freedom, democracy and development.” The\r\nsituations are different in each of the countries of the\r\nregion, but all are of vital importance to the United\r\nStates, as Central America is tied intimately to our\r\ncountry by geography, history and, most importantly,\r\npeople. We have welcomed large numbers of Central\r\nAmericans into the United States and we value the\r\nproductive contributions they make to our society and\r\nthe ties of kinship they have forged between our\r\nnations.\r\nIn the past year, the nations of the region have\r\nmade significant progress on a set of objectives that\r\nserves to bind them together. Economic integration is\r\ndeepening, bringing with it a series of important\r\nbenefits. The United States has announced its intention\r\nto embark upon free trade agreement negotiations with\r\nthe region. This agreement, when concluded, will have\r\nan enormous positive impact on the region’s economic\r\ngrowth and development.\r\nWe applaud the completion of the facilitation\r\nprocess between Belize and Guatemala, under the\r\nauspices of the Organization of American States and\r\nwith a significant contribution from Honduras, on their\r\ncenturies-old border dispute. We note with concern,\r\nhowever, remaining border disputes in the region and\r\nurge Central American nations to resolve border issues\r\nfor the greater good of the region and its inhabitants.\r\nCentral America is an example to the world of\r\nwhat can be accomplished when nations unite in\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\ncommon goals. Not many years ago, the region was\r\nrife with bloody civil wars. Today, civilian authorities\r\nare firmly in control of all of the armed forces, which\r\ncontinue to professionalize and to find more\r\nconstructive roles in society, such as disaster relief and\r\nassisting with border security. The Salvadoran peace\r\naccords of 1992 have come to a successful conclusion\r\nand we urge the Secretary-General to formally\r\nrecognize that fact.\r\nIn Guatemala, though there has been progress in\r\nthe peace process that began in 1996, much more\r\nremains to be accomplished, especially in the human\r\nrights and military reform areas. We endorse the\r\nrecommendation that the United Nations Verification\r\nMission in Guatemala remain to monitor progress\r\nthrough 2004.\r\nDespite the many advances, the region still has a\r\ngreat deal of work to do. The Governments realize that\r\ncorruption is a cancer that affects the entire society and\r\nliterally takes food out of the mouths of hungry\r\nchildren. Intimately tied to corruption is the emergence\r\nof transnational criminals in the region. We urge the\r\nnations to participate fully in the Inter-American\r\nConvention Against Corruption’s Follow-Up\r\nMechanism, reduce impunity and go after corruption in\r\ntheir ranks. We ask each nation to redouble its efforts\r\nin the fight against international criminal organizations\r\nand the illegal, illicit transfer of arms, drugs and human\r\nbeings. Each country should sign and ratify the\r\nremaining international anti-terrorism treaties.\r\nWe are pleased with the successes of the past and\r\nlook forward to the new millennium with great hope,\r\npledging to work hand in hand with the countries of\r\nCentral America on all issues of mutual interest.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI should like to inform members that action on\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.20 will be taken at a later date.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this\r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 38.\r\nAgenda item 30 (continued)\r\nThe role of the United Nations in promoting a new\r\nglobal human order\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.10)\r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall that\r\nthe General Assembly held the debate on agenda item\r\n30 at its forty-third plenary meeting on Monday, 4\r\nNovember 2002.\r\nI should like to announce that, since the\r\nintroduction of draft resolution A/57/L.10, the\r\nfollowing countries have become sponsors: Benin,\r\nBurkina Faso, Cambodia, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, the\r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon,\r\nthe Gambia, Jordan, Lebanon, Mali and Zimbabwe.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.10. May I take it that the Assembly\r\ndecides to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/57/L.10 was adopted\r\n(resolution 57/12).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 30?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 167\r\nSouth American zone of peace and cooperation\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.7)\r\nMr. De Rivero (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): On 27\r\nJuly 2002, the South American presidents, meeting in\r\nGuayaquil, Ecuador, decided to declare the South\r\nAmerican subregion a zone of peace and cooperation.\r\nThe South American zone of peace and\r\ncooperation is not similar to the zones of peace that the\r\nnon-aligned countries declared during the cold war to\r\nfree some regions from the East-West conflict. The\r\nzones of peace of that time were directed towards\r\nrejecting the rivalries among the super-Powers and\r\ntheir blocs. Even better, the South American Zone of\r\nPeace and Cooperation is oriented to reject any\r\nhypothesis of war-like conflict among the South\r\nAmerican democracies.\r\nThe empirical experience of contemporary\r\ninternational relations shows that democracies do not\r\npromote armed conflicts among themselves. In this\r\ncontext, the South American democracies want to\r\nconsolidate this tendency by means of the South\r\nAmerican Zone of Peace and Cooperation.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nIn its first stage, the zone of peace and\r\ncooperation would be aimed at promoting transparency\r\nand fostering confidence-building measures relating to\r\ndefence and security among the South American\r\ncountries, including the eradication of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, of anti-personnel mines and the illicit trade\r\nin small and light weapons. Later on, in Peru’s view,\r\nthe zone of peace and cooperation would proceed to an\r\neffective and gradual limitation of defence\r\nexpenditures and then to a further complex stage —\r\nthat being, disarmament.\r\nThis zone of peace is not a geopolitical objective\r\nin itself. Its ultimate goal should be to release resources\r\nwith the aim of reducing poverty in South America,\r\nsince poverty is imperilling the democratic\r\nGovernments of our countries.\r\nThe South American zone of peace would also\r\nserve to create a favourable atmosphere for cooperation\r\nand to confront jointly the evils of terrorism, drug\r\ntrafficking, organized crime and subversion against\r\ndemocracy, all of which are today’s main threats to\r\nsub-regional security.\r\nSince the General Assembly has already been\r\ninformed about the objectives of this zone of peace and\r\ncooperation, I would now like to present draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.7, entitled “South American zone of\r\npeace and cooperation”. In its preambular paragraphs,\r\nthe draft mentions the regional and subregional efforts\r\nthat are the basis for the proposed zone of peace and\r\ncooperation. It recognizes the firm intent of the States\r\nof South America, taking into account the security\r\nneeds of each country, to adopt measures to contribute\r\nto an effective and gradual limitation of defence\r\nexpenditures in the region, with the aim of having more\r\nresources available for the economic and social\r\ndevelopment of their peoples.\r\nThis is a very important issue, because by\r\nfostering trust, transparency and the control of military\r\nexpenditure, we are seeking to prevent the risk of a\r\nnew arms race in the subcontinent. Furthermore, the\r\ncost of the latest generation of technological weapons\r\nand equipment is nearly inaccessible and — why not\r\nsay so — even immoral, in light of the social demands\r\nof our countries. This goal, far from being utopian, is a\r\nrealistic and sensible approach.\r\nIn the first operative paragraph, the General\r\nAssembly welcomes the declaration of the South\r\nAmerican region as a zone of peace and cooperation.\r\nThis aspect is important, because the declaration shows\r\nthe praiseworthy effort that seeks to contribute to\r\nreinforcing international peace and security at this\r\ncritical moment when the international community is\r\nthreatened by international terrorism and by the\r\nproliferation and development of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nThe subsequent operative paragraphs commend\r\nand welcome the commitments included in the\r\ndeclaration of the zone of peace, such as the decision to\r\nban the use, or threat of use of force among the South\r\nAmerican States, the proscription of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the eradication of anti-personnel mines in\r\nthe region, the implementation of the United Nations\r\nProgramme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons, the fostering of transparency and the gradual\r\nlimitation on arms purchases.\r\nFinally, the last operative paragraph calls upon\r\nthe States of the international community to contribute\r\nto and cooperate with the objectives set forth in the\r\ndeclaration regarding a South American zone of peace\r\nand cooperation.\r\nThe South American countries hope that this draft\r\nresolution, which is a subregional contribution to\r\ninternational peace and security, will be approved by\r\nconsensus by this Assembly.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): My delegation takes special pleasure in\r\nexpressing its full support for the draft resolution\r\ncontained in document A/57/L.7 under agenda item\r\n167, “South American zone of peace and cooperation”.\r\nEcuador and the other countries of South America\r\nbase their international relations on the strictest respect\r\nfor the norms and principles that are part of the legal\r\ntradition and, among others, those set forth in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and the Organization of\r\nAmerican States (OAS). Hence, the strengthening of\r\npeace and security and peaceful settlement of disputes,\r\nthe defence and promotion of human rights, non-\r\nintervention in domestic affairs of other States,\r\nregional integration and harmonious development of\r\nour peoples are genuine pillars of our legal tradition\r\nand our role in the international community.\r\nOver 30 years ago, the Andean countries began\r\nthe first subregional integration process in Latin\r\nAmerica. To date we have substantially moved\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nforward, and today Andean integration covers all\r\naspects of life in the society — trade in goods and\r\nservices; free circulation of people and capital;\r\nharmonization of macro-economic policies; physical\r\nintegration; migration; the social dimension; and,\r\nnaturally, a common foreign policy.\r\nIn this respect, the Andean Commitment to Peace,\r\nSecurity and Cooperation contained in the Declaration\r\nof Galapagos of 17 December 1989, as well as the\r\nLima Commitment and Andean Charter for Peace and\r\nSecurity, adopted in June 2002, are instruments that\r\nguide our external policies and which underscore our\r\ndecision to live in peace. Our vision is shared by the\r\ninternational community and our unequivocal decision\r\nto cooperate in the benefit of development and the\r\nwell-being of our peoples.\r\nAs regards South American regional issues, we\r\nhave sponsored the setting up of a free trade zone\r\nbetween the Andean community and the Southern Cone\r\nCommon Market (MERCOSUR), as well as\r\nstrengthening and deepening relations between the two\r\nsubregional associations. In that context, the Brasilia\r\nCommuniqué, endorsed at the first meeting of the\r\nPresidents of South America in 2000, and the\r\nconclusions of the first meeting of Ministers for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Andean Community,\r\nMERCOSUR and Chile, held in La Paz last year, are\r\nparticularly relevant to defining a common vision that\r\nestablishes the foundation and actions for creating a\r\nSouth American zone of peace and cooperation.\r\nThreats to international peace and security and to\r\ndemocratic stability and the monitoring of human\r\nrights by their very nature are different at the beginning\r\nof the twenty-first century. Armed conflicts between\r\nStates and regular armies occur less frequently today,\r\nbut terrorism, organized crime, drug-trafficking and\r\nethnic and religious violence, underdevelopment,\r\npoverty and extreme inequality and social injustice are\r\nserious dangers that must be confronted jointly by all\r\nmembers of the international community in order to\r\nmake progress in building a more secure, just and\r\nunited world.\r\nDuring the second meeting of the Presidents of\r\nSouth America, held in Guayaquil on 27 July 2002, a\r\nDeclaration on a South American zone of peace and\r\ncooperation was adopted. It is undoubtedly a historic\r\nevent that reflects the best traditions of understanding\r\nand peaceful coexistence between the peoples of the\r\nregion. The South American peace zone, whose basis,\r\nmechanisms and guidelines are clearly reflected in the\r\ndraft resolution before us today, is the expression of\r\nour firm decision to live in peace, confront threats to\r\ninternational peace jointly and cooperate effectively for\r\nthe harmonious development of our peoples within a\r\nframework of democracy and social justice.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to an issue of\r\nspecial interest and significance to my country that\r\nrightly illustrates the positive direction of the relations\r\nand effective cooperation between the peoples of our\r\nregion. Four years ago, through a long process of\r\npeaceful negotiation, with the participation of\r\nArgentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States, Ecuador\r\nand Peru resolved the territorial dispute that had\r\ndivided them since independence. Today, our countries\r\nare experiencing a period of mutual cooperation.\r\nIncreased trade, closer political, cultural and\r\ndiplomatic links, a common view of problems of the\r\ncontemporary world, faith in law, commitment to\r\nregional integration and the fostering of confidence are\r\nsingularly strong in our bilateral relations at the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century. The real benefits\r\nof peace, security and cooperation are limitless.\r\nMr. Moura (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): Brazil\r\nwelcomes Peru’s introduction of the Declaration\r\nregarding a South American zone of peace and\r\ncooperation, adopted by the Presidents of South\r\nAmerica.\r\nMeeting at Guayaquil in July 2002, the Presidents\r\nreaffirmed our belief in democratic values and\r\nprinciples and in the defence of human rights, essential\r\nto advancing the structuring process, and in a common\r\nSouth American space. They also reaffirmed the\r\nnecessary commitment to the main principles of this\r\nOrganization: the search for peaceful solutions to\r\nconflicts and the prohibition of the use or threat of use\r\nof force.\r\nThe Guayaquil Consensus, a corollary to a\r\nprocess begun by the Presidents of South America at\r\nBrasilia in 2000, recognizes the importance of\r\nexpanding and strengthening the regional infrastructure\r\nas a basic factor in the integration of the economic area\r\nof South America and in the development of its\r\ncountries. In that context, the Presidents recognized\r\nthat the interrelationship between infrastructure and\r\ndevelopment must be explored within the context of the\r\nprinciple of open regionalism, based on the results of\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nthe analysis of five basic principles: a geo-economic\r\nperspective, social sustainability, economic efficiency,\r\nenvironmental sustainability and institutional\r\ndevelopment.\r\nConvinced that the physical integration of the\r\nSouth American area will optimize the mobilization of\r\nthe region’s immense economic potential, the\r\nPresidents agreed to strengthen and expand South\r\nAmerican integration processes through active policies\r\nto accelerate economic growth in a sustainable manner,\r\nreduce external vulnerability, improve the distribution\r\nof wealth and reduce poverty levels in the region.\r\nThe Declaration regarding a South American\r\nzone of peace and cooperation, which we are\r\nconsidering today, is framed within that context. It\r\nexpresses the dedication and aspiration of our peoples\r\nto achieve a fruitful future of peaceful coexistence,\r\nlasting cooperation and well-being.\r\nThe Declaration regarding a zone of peace and\r\ncooperation in South America places into context our\r\npolitical willingness to continue to carry out actions of\r\ncoordination and cooperation with a view to shaping a\r\njoint South American area.\r\nThe basic postulates that mark our region’s\r\ntrajectory in the area of disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation, which were already part of many regional\r\ninitiatives and subregional documents, are reaffirmed\r\nin that document: the prohibition of all weapons of\r\nmass destruction, including nuclear ones, the\r\ncommitment to establish a regime for the gradual total\r\neradication of anti-personnel landmines and the\r\ndecisive effort to implement the recommendations of\r\nthe United Nations Programme of Action on Small\r\nArms and Light Weapons.\r\nThe Guayaquil Declaration is the fruit of a\r\nlengthy and ongoing process of dialogue between our\r\ncountries on bilateral and subregional bases that has\r\nenabled us to build an atmosphere of trust and stability.\r\nExamples of that process are the Declaration of\r\nMERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile as a Zone of Peace,\r\nadopted at Ushuaia in 1998, the Declaration of\r\nGalapagos of 1989 and the Lima Commitment of 2002,\r\nwhich created the Andean region zone of peace.\r\nBrazil is proud to belong to a region that is free\r\nof international conflicts and has also consistently had\r\none of the lowest levels of military expenditure, which\r\nis basically directed at replacing obsolete equipment.\r\nMr. Cappagli (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me at the outset to express my delegation’s\r\nappreciation for the fact that the General Assembly is\r\ntaking up the Declaration regarding a South American\r\nzone of peace and cooperation, adopted at Guayaquil,\r\nEcuador, on 27 July 2002.\r\nThis Declaration is an annex to the Guayaquil\r\nConsensus, by which the Presidents of South America\r\ndrew up an ambitious plan of physical integration,\r\nmodernization and development of subregional\r\ninfrastructure in an area where weapon expenditures\r\nare among the lowest in the world.\r\nThe countries of the subregion have been\r\ndeveloping an intensive effort aimed at consolidating,\r\nthrough confidence-building measures, a very friendly\r\nand productive relationship. That is part of the change\r\nin our concept of international security, which has been\r\ntaking place since our countries regained their\r\ndemocratic institutions.\r\nIn that regard, we understand security to represent\r\nthat which allows for the consolidation of basic values,\r\nsuch as representative democracy, respect for human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and\r\ntrade liberalization. This new concept of security,\r\ntogether with the processes for regional and\r\nsubregional integration, have changed the security\r\nframework and have enabled us to see a neighbour no\r\nlonger as a potential enemy or competitor but as a\r\nfriend and partner, eliminating possible conflicts.\r\nArgentina was a pioneer in the promotion of that\r\nkind of initiative, whose objective is to establish in the\r\nregion a new dialogue with a cooperative focus. There\r\nis no doubt about the importance of peace in the\r\nprocess of physical, economic and trade integration.\r\nThe zone of peace of MERCOSUR, Bolivia and Chile,\r\nadopted in Ushuaia, Argentina in 1998, represents an\r\nespecially significant precedent in the creation of an\r\nenvironment of peaceful and cooperative security in the\r\nSouthern Cone.\r\nThe declaration of a South American Zone of\r\nPeace and Cooperation reflects once more, this time\r\ncomprehensively and in a political document, the\r\nvarious commitments already assumed by the countries\r\nin the subregion through legal instruments. It is our\r\nintention to continue working on the consolidation and\r\npromotion of those commitments in the framework of\r\ndialogue in the Committee on Hemispheric Security of\r\nthe Organization of American States, which is\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nresponsible for the analysis and consideration of all\r\nissues related to security in the hemisphere.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): Guyana is pleased to join\r\nsister South American republics in co-sponsoring draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.7, on the South American zone of\r\npeace and cooperation. We welcome and support the\r\ntimely initiative of the delegation of Peru to include\r\nthis item on the agenda of the present session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAt Guayaquil, on 27 July of this year, the leaders\r\nof our continent, recalling the commitment adopted in\r\nthe Brasilia Communiqué of 1 September 2000 to\r\ncreate a South American zone of peace, declared South\r\nAmerica to be a zone of peace and cooperation. They\r\nfurther declared, inter alia, that\r\n“in South America the use of, or the threat\r\nof the use of, force between States shall be\r\nbanned, in keeping with the principles and\r\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter and of\r\nthe Charter of the Organization of American\r\nStates.”\r\nThe adoption of that Declaration represents an\r\nimportant milestone in the relations of the countries of\r\nSouth America. It is a historical decision in the best\r\ntradition of understanding and peaceful coexistence\r\namong the peoples of the region.\r\nIn its implementation, our countries face many\r\ncommon challenges, not least of which is the\r\ndeleterious impact on our societies of persistent\r\npoverty and inequality, transnational crime, the illicit\r\ntrade in drugs and in small arms and light weapons and\r\nthe threat of international terrorism. These all threaten\r\nto nullify the hard-won freedoms and most cherished\r\nvalues of our peoples. They must be confronted with\r\ndetermination and resolve.\r\nThe challenges to which I refer will be\r\nsurmounted only through the fullest and most effective\r\ncooperation of all concerned. Through declaring South\r\nAmerica as a zone of peace and cooperation, the\r\nleaders of our continent have made a solemn\r\ncommitment to create conditions necessary for success\r\nin addressing these challenges.\r\nMy Government subscribes fully to the objectives\r\nset forth in the Guayaquil Declaration. We stand ready\r\nto cooperate fully with all countries in the region and\r\nbeyond to promote peace, security, development and\r\nthe overall well-being of our peoples and of the region\r\nas a whole.\r\nWe therefore look forward to the contribution and\r\ncooperation of States of other regions in the\r\nachievement of the objectives of the declaration on a\r\nSouth American zone of peace and cooperation.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The draft\r\nresolution before the General Assembly today, entitled\r\n“South American zone of peace and cooperation”, is\r\ndirectly and closely related to the fundamental\r\nconcepts underlying the very existence and reason for\r\nbeing of the United Nations.\r\nThe Preamble to the Charter of the Organization\r\nstates that one of its purposes is “to practice tolerance\r\nand live together in peace with one another as good\r\nneighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security”. It then adds as a\r\nfundamental purpose “the promotion of the economic\r\nand social advancement of all peoples”.\r\nAt the second meeting of Presidents of South\r\nAmerica, held in Guayaquil, Ecuador, on 26 and 27\r\nJuly 2002, devoted to the approval of the Guayaquil\r\nConsensus on Integration, Security and Infrastructure\r\nfor Development, the South American heads of State,\r\nin accordance with the aforementioned purposes of the\r\nCharter, issued a formal declaration establishing South\r\nAmerica as a zone of peace and cooperation. As the\r\ndeclaration of the Presidents states, this is a historic act\r\nreflecting the best tradition of understanding and\r\npeaceful coexistence among the peoples of the region\r\nand is intended to become an integral part of a concrete\r\nreality in South America.\r\nCooperation for peace and the development of\r\ncommon actions in the area of security are necessary to\r\nensure and to maintain the pace of progress towards\r\npolitical, economic and social integration among the\r\ncountries of South America and to further the\r\ndevelopment and well-being of the peoples.\r\nOngoing dialogue, whether bilateral or\r\nmultilateral, has been fundamental for creating, on\r\nsolid bases, a climate of growing transparency and trust\r\nthat preserves and ensures peace and friendship among\r\nour peoples. That was made especially clear in those\r\nmoments when our democratic institutions were put to\r\nthe test as a result of the economic crises that have\r\nafflicted many countries in our region.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nThe regions of Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nin general, and South America in particular, have\r\npersevered in their commitment to peace and security,\r\nas demonstrated by the multiple bilateral and\r\nsubregional initiatives of trust and cooperation. Some\r\nof those experiences are truly unprecedented, such as\r\nthe work of the Economic Commission for Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, at the request of the\r\nGovernments of Argentina and Chile, on a standardized\r\ncommon methodology for the measurement of defence\r\nspending of the two countries.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that this programme,\r\nalso known as a standardizing methodology for defence\r\nexpenditures, has been received with interest by other\r\ncountries in our region, leading to conversations for\r\ndeveloping similar efforts. Based on the existence and\r\nimplementation of common methodologies for the\r\naccounting of defence spending, it is possible to\r\noptimize the common efforts aimed at rationalizing and\r\nreducing expenses of this type, generating greater\r\nconfidence and transparency at the bilateral,\r\nsubregional and regional levels.\r\nPeace and development are two notions that are\r\nindissolubly linked. The South American Presidents,\r\nupon subscribing to the Guayaquil Consensus on\r\nIntegration, Security and Infrastructure for\r\nDevelopment and, in that context, declaring South\r\nAmerica to be a zone of peace and cooperation, did\r\nnothing more than to recognize that the threats,\r\nconcerns and other challenges to the peace and security\r\nof nations are of a varied nature and multidimensional\r\nscope, including political, economic, social, health and\r\nenvironmental aspects, among others, that go far\r\nbeyond the traditional military aspect of the question.\r\nFrom this multidimensional perspective, military\r\ninstitutions, in conjunction with civil society, have an\r\nimportant role to play in building a continent of peace\r\nthat, united and in solidarity, plays an active role in the\r\ninternational system.\r\nSouth America is a region in which peaceful\r\ncoexistence has been the norm. Dialogue and the\r\nprivilege of choosing peaceful options for the\r\nsettlement of conflicts have been the rule.\r\nFor years, the States of South America have\r\nassumed and rigorously adhered to the commitment to\r\nentirely prohibit from the region weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. More recently, we have done the same with\r\nregard to the prohibition of anti-personnel mines and\r\nhave assumed the commitment to achieve as quickly as\r\npossible their eradication, as well as to implement the\r\nrecommendations of the Programme of Action to\r\nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in\r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects.\r\nAccordingly, the Government of Chile has given\r\nthese policies, which involve both disarmament and\r\nhumanitarian issues, its vigorous and resolute support.\r\nFor more than a decade, it has steadfastly supported the\r\ndevelopment of numerous initiatives in confidence-\r\nbuilding and transparency at the regional, sub-regional\r\nand bilateral levels. Naturally, it was with great\r\nsatisfaction that Chile subscribed to the Guayaquil\r\nConsensus on Integration, Security and Infrastructure\r\nfor Development and to the declaration of South\r\nAmerica as a zone of peace and cooperation.\r\nWe acknowledge the different circumstances and\r\nsituations that exist in other regions of the world in the\r\narea of peace and cooperation for development, and we\r\nhope that this initiative will be an additional and\r\nconstructive asset for the international community as a\r\nwhole in its ongoing search for ways to promote\r\npeaceful co-existence and the development and well-\r\nbeing of peoples.\r\nMs. Rivero (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nPerhaps we do not have much to add to what has\r\nalready been said by the preceding speakers. But we\r\nunderstand that in the dynamics of the processes that\r\nexist in every region of the world, what matters is the\r\nvision that the countries of the region have. This is why\r\nUruguay would like to express in this debate its firm\r\nsupport for the declaration of the South American Zone\r\nof Peace and Cooperation, endorsed during the second\r\nmeeting of the Presidents of South America last July in\r\nGuayaquil.\r\nFor Uruguay, this declaration of peace and\r\ncooperation is not and end in itself. Rather, it contains\r\na broader commitment, like that originally expressed in\r\nthe Brasilia Communiqué of 2000. It is clear that the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of confidence-\r\nbuilding measures, full observance of international\r\ninstruments related to nuclear and conventional\r\ndisarmament, and non-use of the threat of force all\r\nnaturally point to the creation of an area of peace that\r\nextends beyond the borders of individual countries. But\r\nit must also be obvious that an area of peace cannot be\r\nthe final objective, but rather the beginning of\r\nsomething more ambitious.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nThe geographical contiguity of our countries,\r\nwhich in other times fuelled conflict, has today become\r\na factor that promotes unity and cooperation. Indeed,\r\nour region is distinguished in the international scene\r\nfor having once and for all overcome territorial\r\ndisputes in a peaceful and negotiated way, showing our\r\nspirit of compromise and our adhesion to international\r\nlaw. This spirit, though it shows that there is a firm\r\ndetermination to bolster security in the region, is even\r\nmore important in that it allows us to have active\r\ncooperative processes, many of which are currently\r\nbeing implemented.\r\nThe national priorities with respect to\r\nstrengthening democracy and respect for and defence\r\nof human rights, individual and collective, are several\r\nof the common elements of what could be called the\r\n“South American agenda”. They are common not\r\nbecause they are called common, but because they are\r\nconsidered to be indispensable in order to reach a state\r\nof security in which the process of developing our\r\ncountries can be accelerated.\r\nThese actions, aimed at consolidating peace,\r\nsecurity, cooperation and development, are the\r\nfoundations of this broader commitment that we\r\nmentioned at the beginning of our intervention. Our\r\ncountries have undertaken a dialogue on regional\r\nsecurity that takes into account the humanitarian, social\r\nand economic aspects of the question. Uruguay\r\nbelieves that that dialogue is the natural process\r\ntowards a true regional integration. The declaration of\r\nSouth America peace and cooperation, which we hope\r\nwill receive the international community’s recognition\r\ntoday, is a step in this direction.\r\nUruguay does not see peace solely as an absence\r\nof conflict. We see it as a situation that includes other\r\npositive elements such as security and freedom. They\r\nform the sole context that will allow our Governments,\r\nwhich are responsible for providing for the well-being\r\nand prosperity of their peoples, to meet the\r\ncommitment that has been given to them and is\r\nexpected of them.\r\nMr. Valdivieso (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): It\r\nis an honour for me to speak on behalf of Colombia in\r\nthe plenary of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly on item 167, whose inclusion in the agenda\r\nwas requested by the Permanent Mission of Peru.\r\nMy country, along with other South American\r\nsister nations, sponsored draft resolution A/57/L.7,\r\nwhich welcomes the declaration of our Presidents in\r\nwhich they declared South America to be a zone of\r\npeace and cooperation. This declaration, adopted in\r\nGuayaquil, Ecuador, on 27 July, is one of the results of\r\nthe Brasilia Communiqué of 1 September 2000. In that\r\ndocument, the Presidents of South America — in\r\ndeveloping the spirit of harmony and understanding\r\nbetween our countries, with our geographic proximity\r\nand our shared values — agreed to a wider and deeper\r\nregional cooperation and solidarity in order to deal\r\nwith fundamental issues such as democracy, trade,\r\ninfrastructure for integration, illicit drugs and\r\nconnected crimes, and information, knowledge and\r\ntechnology.\r\nIn the declaration, which we hope that the\r\nGeneral Assembly will welcome today, our countries\r\npropose to form the South American Zone of Peace and\r\nCooperation on the basis of strengthening our\r\ncooperation and consultation mechanisms in the area of\r\ndefence and security. For the Government of Colombia,\r\ncommitted to implement a democratic security and\r\ndefence strategy to confront terrorism and the global\r\nproblem of illicit drugs that finances it, cooperation\r\nfrom the entire international community and the South\r\nAmerican region is fundamental.\r\nOur region must strengthen its cooperation in the\r\nareas of intelligence; police operations; control of\r\ntrafficking in, and the diversion of, chemical\r\nprecursors; control of the illicit trade in arms,\r\nmunitions and explosives; and the fight against money-\r\nlaundering, as agreed in the Brasilia communiqué,\r\nwhere our Presidents decided to create a joint\r\nmechanism for periodic consultations among\r\ninstitutions in charge of the combat against drug\r\ntrafficking and related crimes.\r\nWe must undertake a major regional effort to\r\novercome illicit drug trafficking, because, as President\r\nUribe of Colombia stated recently before the General\r\nAssembly, “We have only managed to seize 20 per cent\r\nof the drugs that are shipped from our country.” We\r\nshould fully acknowledge the shared responsibility of\r\nproducing, transit and consuming countries — a\r\nprinciple that our Presidents, several years ago,\r\ndetermined to be fundamental in relations and\r\ncooperation among States.\r\nColombia welcomes the definitive solution that\r\nhas been found to territorial disputes among the\r\ncountries of our region, which has made possible the\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.50\r\nDeclaration on South America as a zone of peace and\r\ncooperation. Nevertheless, our democratic stability and\r\nthe integrity of the political, economic and social\r\nstructures of our countries still face grave threats, such\r\nas terrorism, corruption and extreme poverty. That is\r\nwhy, like other countries of the region, we believe that\r\ndemocracy in Latin America should be strengthened\r\nthrough the ongoing promotion and safeguarding of the\r\nrule of law and human rights.\r\nThe democratic security and defence strategy\r\nadopted by Colombia to fight the violence in the\r\ncountry aims to consolidate the rule of law and to\r\nguarantee human rights for all Colombians: our\r\nfarmers, so that they are not displaced from their land;\r\nour businessmen, so that they are not victims of\r\nkidnapping; our journalists, so that they are not\r\nthreatened; our labour leaders, so that they can exercise\r\ntheir duties freely; and our human rights defenders, so\r\nthat they can work without intimidation.\r\nDemocratic security, as President Uribe has said,\r\nis aimed at protecting all citizens of a pluralistic nation\r\nthat is open to fraternal and creative debate — a nation\r\nthat can count on the solidarity of its South American\r\nbrothers in its fight against violence and terrorism.\r\nFor this reason, we welcome today the South\r\nAmerican zone of peace and cooperation, because we\r\nsee it as a resolute commitment in the fight against\r\nthreats to the security of our States — a commitment to\r\ncoordinated action and concerted common strategies to\r\nconfront together these serious threats to the security of\r\nour countries and to the stability of our region.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/57/L.7.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.7?\r\nDraft resolution A/57/L.7 was adopted (resolution\r\n57/13).\r\nThe Acting President: May I also take it that it\r\nis the wish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 167?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.\r\n"
