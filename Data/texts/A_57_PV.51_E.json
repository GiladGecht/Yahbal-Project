"United Nations A/57/PV.51\r\n \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nFifty-seventh session\r\n51st plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 15 November 2002, 10 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of\r\nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original\r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature\r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room\r\nC-154A. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n02-69514 (E)\r\n*0269514*\r\nPresident: Mr. Kavan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 28\r\nAssistance in mine action\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/430)\r\nMr. Mustafa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It gives\r\nme pleasure, as we meet today to examine agenda item\r\n28 regarding assistance in mine action, to express, on\r\nbehalf of the Sudan, our deep gratitude and\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his\r\ncomprehensive report (A/57/430) on the subject and for\r\nhis invaluable efforts in ensuring the implementation of\r\nthe six strategic goals contained in the United Nations\r\nMine Action Strategy for 2001-2005.\r\nI would also like to thank, in particular, all\r\nassessment missions and field missions dispatched to\r\nmine-affected countries, as well as all international,\r\nregional and national agencies, organizations and\r\nprogrammes operating in this field.\r\nBecause it recognizes the great risks that mines\r\npose, especially to civilians, the Sudan was one of the\r\nfirst countries to sign the Ottawa Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their\r\nDestruction. As the Assembly is aware, my country is\r\namong those that face the risks related to mines; that is\r\nwhy we strongly support all international and regional\r\nefforts aimed at eliminating such risks.\r\nIn that context, we pay tribute to the efforts\r\nundertaken in this sphere since the entry into force of\r\nthe Convention in March 1999 and the ensuing\r\nmultilateral action, represented in the decisions and\r\nrecommendations made at the Third Meeting of the\r\nStates Parties to the Convention, held at Managua.\r\nOver the past three years, those efforts have led to a\r\nrelative decrease in the production, stockpiling and use\r\nof landmines and supplement the United Nations effort\r\nto provide assistance in mine action. Here, cooperation\r\nhas begun with two of our national agencies — the\r\nHumanitarian Assistance Agency and the Corps of\r\nEngineers — to build a national centre for mine action\r\nin the Sudan, where a database would be established\r\nand surveys undertaken to map out locations affected\r\nby mines in the Sudan.\r\nIn addition, many international and national\r\norganizations have participated in a European Union\r\nproject to assist in mine action in the Sudan. That\r\nproject has begun to train local personnel in the safe\r\nremoval of landmines. Moreover, we appreciate the\r\nefforts of UNICEF, in coordination with national\r\ninstitutions, to raise the population’s awareness of mine\r\nrisks. A national mine network has been established to\r\ncoordinate all mine-related efforts, including those of\r\nGovernment agencies — in particular our\r\nHumanitarian Assistance Agency, the Corps of\r\nEngineers, security organs and relevant ministries —\r\nand those of international organizations, especially the\r\nUnited Nations. Action is taken on three tracks:\r\nawareness-raising, victim assistance and mine removal.\r\nI cite all of these examples in order to outline my\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nGovernment’s commitment and its serious demining\r\nefforts, in coordination with international efforts.\r\nThe problem of landmines and ordnance remains\r\na major obstacle to development projects and\r\nreconstruction in many countries, especially\r\ndeveloping countries. The Sudan’s experience in the\r\nNuba mountains region has been promising thanks to\r\nthe assistance of the United Nations and of the\r\nEuropean Union, which has resulted in the return of\r\ncivilians to their villages and in the resumption of\r\ngrazing and agricultural activities. That gives us hope\r\nfor the implementation of the United Nations mine-\r\naction strategy according to the established timetable\r\nand for the creation of an international environment\r\nfree of landmines, especially in the light of the fact that\r\nthere are 126 States parties to the Convention thus far.\r\nThat fact underscores the wide acceptance of\r\ninternational standards and measures on anti-personnel\r\nmines.\r\nWe are certain that further progress can be\r\nachieved if the efforts of the United Nations and of the\r\nGeneva International Centre for Humanitarian\r\nDemining are coordinated with national and regional\r\nefforts, through partnerships with all concerned parties\r\nand relevant international organizations. We are\r\ncounting on financing from the World Bank and from\r\nother international lending agencies to provide us with\r\nthe resources necessary to ensure the implementation\r\nof the mine-action strategy of the United Nations.\r\nIn closing, I should like to emphasize my\r\ncountry’s firm resolve to cooperate with United\r\nNations assistance programmes to eliminate mines in\r\nthe Sudan. From this rostrum, I call upon all Member\r\nStates to assist mine-affected countries in developing\r\nour national programmes, in accordance with the\r\nOttawa Convention on the prohibition of landmines, in\r\nparticular because we all recognize that landmines and\r\nother explosive devices pose risks to human beings, in\r\naddition to hindering national development projects in\r\nmany countries.\r\nMr. Flores (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): A year ago,\r\nin this forum, the delegation of Peru stated that there\r\nwas no doubt about the existence of the political will to\r\neradicate anti-personnel mines and that it could not be\r\notherwise, because they are horrific weapons that claim\r\ninnocent victims, especially children.\r\nFor that reason, we were surprised to observe, in\r\ndiscussions in the First Committee on the draft\r\nresolution on the implementation of the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, that political circumstances are being\r\nbrought forward to justify their use. For Peru, there is\r\nno possible justification for the use of anti-personnel\r\nmines in conflicts, because they are inherently evil and,\r\nin technical language, are classified as excessively\r\ncruel weapons with indiscriminate effects in the\r\nmutilation of innocent victims, especially children,\r\neven when the conflict that caused their placement has\r\nended.\r\nIn that context, Peru welcomes the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on assistance in mine action\r\n(A/57/430). Especially important is the progress made\r\nin preparing a rapid response plan to meet demining\r\nneeds in emergency situations and the inclusion of\r\ndemining programmes in operations carried out under\r\nthe mandate of the United Nations. Peru shares the\r\nopinion of the Secretary-General that organizations\r\ndevoted to mine action should widen the scope of their\r\nactivities, integrating them with humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment programmes.\r\nA year ago, we reported the progress made by\r\nPeru in the total eradication of anti-personnel mines.\r\nFor the Peruvian delegation, it is gratifying to have this\r\nnew opportunity to share with the rest of the\r\ninternational community the progress made in 2002.\r\nPeru is fulfilling the two sets of complementary\r\nactivities on mines. On the one hand, we have taken the\r\nnecessary action to avoid the use of mines in the future;\r\non the other, we are dealing with the effects of mines\r\nthat have already been placed. Peru has completed the\r\ndestruction of the 321,368 anti-personnel mines that\r\nwere held in the Peruvian arsenal. The process has\r\nenjoyed the support and verification of representatives\r\nof the international community, the United Nations, the\r\nOrganization of American States, the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross and civil society.\r\nSimilarly, we are coordinating with our police\r\nforces the demining of the 1,400 high-tension towers\r\nthat required protection during the terrible period of\r\nterrorism in our country. Accordingly, in April 2002,\r\nPeru and the Organization of American States\r\nexpanded the scope of the agreement on the\r\nComprehensive Action against Antipersonnel Mines,\r\nsigned in May 2001. That expansion will make it\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\npossible to extend cooperation to demining activities\r\non 350 high-tension electrical towers.\r\nLikewise, a draft bill has been prepared for the\r\ncreation of a Peruvian anti-personnel demining centre,\r\nwhich will develop the planning and operations\r\nnecessary to fulfil governmental goals, based on\r\nobligations under the Ottawa Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, as well as coordination with national units\r\nin charge of implementing the aforementioned\r\nmandates.\r\nThe eradication of anti-personnel mines is part of\r\na more ambitious goal of Peru’s foreign policy aimed at\r\nlimiting arms expenditures in South America in order\r\nto devote greater funds to social investment. Within\r\nthat policy, Peru is interested in transforming the\r\nregion, the world’s first nuclear-weapon-free zone, into\r\nits first zone free of anti-personnel mines. In the\r\ncontext of that effort, the foreign and defence ministers\r\nof the Andean Community — consisting of Peru,\r\nBolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela —\r\napproved last June the Andean Charter for peace and\r\nsecurity and the limitation and control of foreign\r\ndefence spending, which, in chapter IX, entitled\r\n“Commitments to the eradication of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines”, reaffirms the commitment of all the\r\nAndean countries not to use, develop, produce, acquire,\r\nstockpile, conserve or transfer anti-personnel\r\nlandmines, directly or indirectly, under any\r\ncircumstance whatsoever.\r\nSubsequently, in July 2002, all the presidents of\r\nthe 12 South American countries approved the\r\nDeclaration on the South American zone of peace and\r\ncooperation, which was duly welcomed by the General\r\nAssembly yesterday. The Declaration recognizes the\r\ngradual elimination, leading as soon as possible to the\r\ntotal eradication of anti-personnel mines. We hope that\r\nthese and other efforts will allow us to achieve the\r\nshared objective of banning anti-personnel mines.\r\nMr. Khalid (Pakistan): For the last many years,\r\nour discussions on the consequences of the\r\nindiscriminate use of landmines have had mixed\r\nresults. Ironically, the use of landmines have mostly\r\nharmed the civilian population in various parts of the\r\nworld. Over 70 developing countries, including\r\nAfghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Burundi,\r\nSomalia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, are suffering\r\nbecause of the irresponsible use of landmines as a\r\nresult of foreign occupation or internal conflicts. It is\r\nalarming to know that an estimated 110 million anti-\r\npersonnel mines are currently deployed in 70 countries.\r\nThe conflict areas in which these landmines have been\r\nimplanted not only pose a danger to human and animal\r\nlives, but are also a major source of serious social and\r\neconomic problems.\r\nIn Afghanistan, there are over 10 million\r\nlandmines scattered all over the country, which is\r\nperhaps the largest mine-strewn land in the world. The\r\nmiseries of the people of Afghanistan are further\r\ncompounded by the remnants of unexploded ordnance\r\nfollowing the war against Al Qaeda. We appreciate the\r\nefforts undertaken by the Mine Action Programme for\r\nAfghanistan, under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations Mine Action Service\r\n(UNMAS), which assumed the responsibility of\r\nclearing mines and unexploded ordnance in\r\nAfghanistan in June this year, will be able to discharge\r\nits duties in a diligent manner.\r\nWe are alarmed to see that mine and unexploded\r\nordnance contamination has affected 31 out of the 32\r\nprovinces, in 1,585 villages in Afghanistan. The Mine\r\nAction Programme for Afghanistan has estimated that,\r\nat current levels of the Programme’s funding, as many\r\nas 360 square kilometres of high-priority mined land\r\ncan be cleared within the next seven years. We think\r\nthat, with additional resources, this period can be\r\nfurther reduced and many precious lives saved.\r\nUNMAS estimates indicate that as many as 300\r\nAfghans are killed every month in the mine-infested\r\nareas, while the number of those injured is much\r\nhigher. Almost half of those injured have been treated\r\nin hospitals in Pakistan. Despite pressure on our\r\nmedical facilities, we have been providing relief to\r\nAfghan mine victims.\r\nWe have taken careful note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “Assistance in mine action”,\r\ncontained in document A/57/430. We are glad that the\r\nSecretary-General has outlined the United Nations\r\nMine Action Strategy for 2001-2005. In this regard, we\r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s initiative to raise\r\nawareness on mine-action problems, to develop a rapid\r\nresponse plan and to build up the capacities of national\r\nGovernments. We also hope that the Inter-Agency\r\nCoordination Group on Mine Action will chalk out a\r\ncomprehensive plan of action, in coordination with\r\nvarious relevant agencies of the United Nations, in\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\naddressing emergencies resulting from mines and\r\nunexploded ordnance.\r\nWe also appreciate the positive role played by the\r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross and other\r\nnon-governmental organizations in responding to mine-\r\nrelated emergencies. We would suggest that there\r\nshould be greater interaction between the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service and reputable non-\r\ngovernmental organizations involved in demining\r\nefforts.\r\nComing back to the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nwe are somewhat disappointed to see that UNMAS\r\nreceived only $28 million from donors between\r\nJanuary 2001 and August 2002. Since these funds are\r\nmade available through voluntary contributions, we\r\nurge the donor nations to bridge the gap that exists in\r\nthe overwhelming majority of demining operations in\r\nvarious countries, especially Afghanistan, and the\r\nscarce resources available for the realization of these\r\ntasks. We are particularly concerned because Afghan\r\nrefugees, taking shelter in Pakistan, have been unable\r\nto return to their homes due to the slow pace of\r\ndemining operations. We hope that the United Nations\r\nand the international community will take due note of\r\nthe precarious situation prevailing in Afghanistan and\r\nrespond to this emergency on a priority basis.\r\nPakistan has actively contributed to the demining\r\noperations in several affected countries in the past. Our\r\nparticipation in the demining operations in Kuwait,\r\nCambodia, Angola, Bosnia and the Western Sahara\r\nreflects our commitment.\r\nSince 1997, Pakistan has declared a moratorium\r\non the export of landmines. We have also ratified the\r\nAmended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain\r\nConventional Weapons (CCW) and have submitted\r\ninformation pursuant to Article XI (2) and Article XIII\r\n(4) of the Amended Protocol II. We remain ready to\r\nconsider further measures and initiatives in the relevant\r\nmultilateral forums to address the problem arising from\r\nthe indiscriminate use of landmines.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report makes cursory\r\nmention of the mine action situation in South Asia.\r\nPakistan has been obliged to take precautionary\r\ndefensive measures in the face of massive Indian\r\nmilitary deployment against our country since\r\nDecember of last year. We will de-escalate as soon as\r\nIndia starts the demining process. According to Human\r\nRights Watch, several hundred Indian civilian and\r\nmilitary casualties took place during the planting of\r\nlandmines in the wake of the Indian military build-up\r\nalong the international border and the Line of Control.\r\nThis is an unfortunate and completely avoidable loss of\r\nlife, caused by the irresponsible use of landmines.\r\nMr. President, allow me to state that Pakistan\r\nenjoys a unique record on clearing all minefields after\r\nthe three wars in South Asia. There has never been a\r\nhumanitarian situation caused by the use of these\r\nmines. We remain committed to ensuring that the mines\r\nin our military inventory will never become the cause\r\nof civilian casualties in Pakistan or anywhere else.\r\nIn the past decade, great strides have been made\r\nin understanding the horrific effects of landmines and\r\nin stigmatizing their use and production. It is time to\r\ntake the remaining steps, in the relevant multilateral\r\nforums, for effective control of these landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): On\r\nthe question of mines, Egypt speaks from\r\nexperience — indeed, painful experience — that lasted\r\nmore than half a century. During that time, Egypt lost\r\napproximately 8,000 of its nationals to landmines.\r\nMy country is one of the most seriously affected\r\ncountries when it comes to mines. Several battles\r\nduring the Second World War took place on our\r\nterritory; they left behind 280,000 hectares of land that\r\nhad to be demined. This is a serious obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment of the area, near the northern coastline,\r\nwhich could otherwise be exploited for agricultural and\r\ntourist purposes.\r\nIn order to face this grave challenge, in the year\r\n1991 Egypt undertook an ambitious effort to clear the\r\nland of mines and unexploded ordnance. Egypt is still\r\nshouldering the main burden, both human and material,\r\ninvolved in implementing this project, despite the fact\r\nthat foreign forces left those mines behind on Egyptian\r\nterritory. Hence, Egypt’s call to the countries that\r\nplanted the mines to shoulder the cost of clearing them.\r\nThis would enable the Egyptian people to use their own\r\nland for their own benefit.\r\nWithin the context of Egypt’s efforts to face the\r\nproblem of landmines and their impact, we have for the\r\nlast three years cooperated with the United Nations\r\nMining Unit in the field of landmines, which resulted\r\nin a mission being sent by the United Nations to Egypt\r\nin order to evaluate the problem during the period 9 to\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\n23 February 2000. The United Nations then published a\r\nreport dated 7 July 2000, which included a\r\ncomprehensive review of the problem of mines in\r\nEgypt and practical proposals for dealing with this\r\nproblem. Egypt will pursue its contacts with the United\r\nNations Secretariat and other concerned countries to\r\nconsider how to clear these mines on Egyptian\r\nterritory. For its part, in the year 2000, Egypt\r\nestablished a high-level mechanism to organize the\r\nnecessary national administrative and technical\r\ncommittee to deal with the problem of landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance. The national committee is made\r\nup of representatives of the ministries and relevant\r\nagencies supervising the clearance of mines and other\r\nwar remnants.\r\nWe have studied the Secretary-General’s report\r\non assistance in mine action. We have also taken note\r\nof the United Nations Mine Action Strategy for the\r\nyear 2001-2005 referred to in the report. We have\r\npresented our remarks to the relevant unit in the\r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations. Regrettably,\r\nthe review and assessment that were supposed to be\r\nconducted on the Strategy have been postponed until\r\nnext year. We wish that the United Nations unit had\r\nattached the remarks of Member States to the report\r\nwhich is before us today. Regrettably, this did not\r\nhappen.\r\nWe have previously stated that the United Nations\r\nMine Action Strategy for 2001-2005 is a departure\r\nfrom what was adopted regarding the Strategy in 1998.\r\nWe have mentioned that this Strategy is characterized\r\nby shortcomings in dealing with the needs of the\r\naffected countries. Hence, our call for a review of the\r\nStrategy. We aspire to making this a reality next year.\r\nThe remarks of the Member States should be taken into\r\nconsideration in order to ensure that the Strategy is\r\neffective and efficient and attains its objectives.\r\nIn conclusion, regarding the Ottawa Convention\r\non the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production,\r\nand Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, we wish to emphasize that Egypt agrees\r\nwith the humanitarian objectives of the Convention,\r\nbut many countries, including my own, have\r\nreservations on it. These reservations have been\r\nreferred to at several international forums. Foremost\r\namong them is that the Convention ignores the\r\nresponsibilities of the States that laid mines in the land\r\nof others and that have not taken any action to remove\r\nthem. There is a lack of clarity and comprehensiveness\r\nin the Convention concerning the assistance necessary\r\nfor this purpose. In addition to that is the fact that the\r\nConvention totally ignores the rights and\r\nresponsibilities of States to secure their borders and to\r\ndefend their own territories.\r\nEgypt joins previous speakers who have\r\nexpressed their concern regarding reports and\r\ninformation that some of the member States signatories\r\nto the Ottawa Convention have reverted to the use of\r\nanti-personnel mines. This reflects on the Convention’s\r\ncredibility and strengthens the call for its revision and\r\nfor assessment of the methodology for dealing with the\r\nwhole problem.\r\nMr. Kittikhoun (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): At the outset, allow me to express my\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the\r\ncomprehensive and informative report (A/57/430) he\r\nhas presented to us on assistance in mine action. The\r\nreport not only focuses on the progress achieved in\r\nimplementing the six strategic goals and related\r\nobjectives outlined in the United Nations Mine Action\r\nStrategy for 2001-2005. It has also given us an\r\noverview of mine action undertaken in various\r\ncountries of the world by United Nations programmes\r\nand other related agencies. Furthermore, the report also\r\noutlines lessons and experiences learned from the past\r\nand gives us guidance on how to tackle effectively the\r\nmine issue in the future.\r\nThe international community continues to be\r\nconcerned about the question of mines and other\r\nunexploded ordnance (UXO) that are present as a result\r\nof protracted wars, regional conflicts and internal\r\nstruggles. National Governments have made all the\r\nefforts they possibly could to resolve that problem. Yet,\r\nmillions of landmines and other unexploded ordnance\r\nare still buried in the soil or are scattered on the surface\r\nin more than 60 countries around the world. Thousands\r\nof innocent people are killed or injured every day.\r\nTherefore, every effort should be made to intensify\r\ninternational cooperation in order to address that issue\r\nmore effectively.\r\nIn February 2001, at the age of 41, Mr.\r\nViengthong, the father of a family, struggling for\r\nsurvival in a remote village in Attapeu, a southern\r\nprovince of Laos, was cutting hillside grass with a long\r\nblade. Suddenly, he made contact with an anti-\r\npersonnel cluster bomblet. The bomb exploded. He lost\r\nhis left eye and was completely blinded in the other.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nThe blast also caused serious impairment to his\r\nhearing. In short, the rest of his life has been ruined as\r\na result. This sad story is only one of the many tragic\r\naccidents that have occurred, which can again occur\r\nany day, at any time, anywhere in the 15 unexploded-\r\nordnance-contaminated Lao provinces.\r\nIn fact, few countries in the history of warfare\r\nhave experienced anything like what we did in Laos:\r\nthe heaviest aerial bombardment of the Indo-China\r\nwar, particularly between 1964 and 1973. During that\r\nperiod, more than 400,000 bombing missions were\r\nlaunched, dropping more than 2 million tons of bombs\r\non our small, poor country. More than 25 years after\r\nthe end of the war, unexploded ordnance contamination\r\nstill affects 50 per cent of the country’s total land mass.\r\nUnexploded ordnance continues to limit the physical\r\nsafety, livelihood and food security of people in 25 per\r\ncent of all villages in the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic and constitutes a significant obstacle to\r\nbroader socio-economic development.\r\nIn order to address this problem, the Government\r\nof the Lao People’s Democratic Republic set up in\r\n1996 the Lao National Unexploded Ordnance\r\nProgramme (UXO-Lao), with the objectives of\r\nreducing the number of civilian casualties from\r\nunexploded ordnance and increasing the amount of\r\nland available for food production and other\r\ndevelopment activities. UXO-Lao activities are divided\r\ninto four important components: community\r\nawareness, training and capacity-building, survey, and\r\nclearance. The programme is now fully operational in\r\n15 of the UXO-contaminated provinces and has a total\r\nnational work force of 1,156. Since its inception, UXO-\r\nLao has cleared 26.7 square kilometres of land,\r\nincluding 873 hectares in 2001, and has educated some\r\n800,000 people nationwide about the dangers of UXO.\r\nThe UXO-Lao trust fund, supported by the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), continues\r\nto be the main channel for contributions to the work of\r\nUXO-Lao. Funding has been provided by UNDP,\r\nUNICEF, the European Union, and the Governments of\r\nAustralia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland,\r\nFrance, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,\r\nNew Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom\r\nand the United States. Some international\r\nimplementing partners, such as Handicapped\r\nInternational, the Mine Advisory Group, Norwegian\r\nPeople’s Aid, and so forth, also support the\r\nprogramme. In that regard, the Lao Government would\r\nlike to express sincere gratitude to all donors for their\r\ngenerous assistance and support, which have rendered\r\nthe UXO-Lao trust fund activities possible. It is our\r\nfervent hope that the international community will\r\ncontinue to lend its support and assistance to our\r\nefforts achieve the objectives set out in the programme.\r\nIt is sad to note that landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance are still threatening the lives of people in\r\nmany regions of the world. For many countries, in\r\nparticular developing countries, landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance constitute an obstacle to social\r\nand economic development. In order to ensure a\r\npeaceful and productive life for those now living with\r\nthe threat of landmines, we believe that, through\r\nconcerted global efforts and cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations as a focal point for mine action, the\r\nhuge tasks lying ahead can be accomplished.\r\nMr. Scott (Australia): In this difficult time, we\r\ncontinue to make considerable progress in\r\nstrengthening international norms against anti-\r\npersonnel landmines. Nevertheless, the battle is far\r\nfrom over. Indeed, there are constant reminders that\r\nmuch work remains ahead of us. The fact that this\r\nyear’s Landmine Monitor Report, published by The\r\nInternational Campaign to Ban Landmines, estimates\r\nthat a further 15,000 to 20,000 landmine casualties\r\noccurred during 2001 — the same as in the previous\r\nyear — is a clear reminder that we must redouble our\r\nefforts.\r\nWe can address this human tragedy only if we\r\nbring a halt to the use of all anti-personnel landmines\r\nthrough universal adherence to, and respect for, the\r\nOttawa Convention and by allocating the necessary\r\nresources for mine clearance, mine awareness and\r\nvictim assistance activities. Australia offers its full\r\nsupport to the Convention and encourages the broadest\r\nparticipation possible. My Government continues to\r\nwork closely with other Member States to encourage\r\nwider adherence to the Convention. We value the\r\nopportunity to share experiences and approaches with\r\nthose equally committed to universal adoption of the\r\nConvention. We urge any State that is facing\r\ndifficulties in committing to, or meeting its obligations\r\nunder, the Convention to discuss their concerns with\r\nother Members to identify the necessary support.\r\nAustralia supports the key principles, strategic\r\ngoals and objectives of the United Nations Mine Action\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nStrategy for the period 2001-2005 by: providing core\r\nfunds to the United Nations Mine Action Service\r\n(UNMAS) for its coordination role in mine action\r\nactivities; by funding mine action interventions that\r\nhelp build national and local capacities to plan,\r\ncoordinate and implement mine action programmes; by\r\nencouraging the use and development of the\r\nInternational Mine Action Standards; and by providing\r\nconsiderable resources for mine action globally.\r\nMs. Jarbussynova (Kazakhstan), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nDevelopment and stability in our region are key\r\nconcerns for Australia. Through support of those Asian\r\ncountries that are heavily mine-affected, Australia’s\r\nmine action programme contributes to promoting a\r\nprosperous and stable future. Our efforts continue to\r\nfocus on the Asia-Pacific region, specifically South-\r\nEast Asia and the South Pacific. Over the past 12\r\nmonths we have worked closely with the Governments\r\nof Canada, Thailand, Japan and New Zealand to build\r\nsupport for the Convention in South and South-East\r\nAsia and the South Pacific.\r\nI would like to make particular reference to the\r\ninitiative of Thailand in hosting a regional landmines\r\nconference for countries of the Association of South-\r\nEast Asian Nations in May of this year. Australia,\r\ntogether with Canada and Japan, had the pleasure of\r\nco-sponsoring that event. The meeting was a\r\nparticularly valuable opportunity for Government and\r\nnon-government representatives to exchange views and\r\nideas on how best to address the landmines problem in\r\nSouth-East Asia. It was also an opportunity to better\r\nunderstand the barriers to accession or ratification and\r\nserved to underline the difficulties in making progress,\r\nwhich, at best, will be incremental. Australia warmly\r\nwelcomes Thailand’s offer to host the Fifth Meeting of\r\nStates Parties to the Ottawa Convention. A meeting in\r\nSouth-East Asia will give much-needed impetus to\r\nefforts to build support for the Convention in that\r\nheavily mine-affected region.\r\nThe Australian Government continues its firm\r\ncommitment to mine action and over the past 12\r\nmonths has committed more than 12 million Australian\r\ndollars to a range of humanitarian mine action\r\nprogrammes. With 73 million Australian dollars\r\nexpended since January 1996, the Australian\r\nGovernment is well advanced in meeting its\r\nundertaking to provide some 100 million Australian\r\ndollars on mine action activities for the decade to\r\nDecember 2005. Once again, the main recipients of\r\nAustralia’s mine action funding are Sri Lanka,\r\nCambodia and Laos. Reinforcing that focus on South-\r\nEast Asia, we are pleased that we will shortly\r\ncommence funding a three-year mine clearance project\r\nin partnership with the Government of Viet Nam.\r\nIn recognition of the significant mine and\r\nunexploded ordnance problem faced by Afghanistan,\r\nAustralia has contributed a total of 3 million Australian\r\ndollars to mine clearance activities in that country. In\r\nthis context, Australia is encouraged by the recent\r\nundertaking by the new Government in Afghanistan to\r\naccede to the Ottawa Convention. This is a significant\r\nmove and — we would hope — a move that will\r\nencourage others who continue to insist on the\r\nnecessity of anti-personnel landmines to seriously\r\nreconsider their position with regard to the Ottawa\r\nConvention.\r\nEqually, and in conclusion, we acknowledge and\r\nwelcome the announcements made by Sri Lanka and\r\nthe world’s newest State, Timor-Leste, that they will\r\nmove quickly towards accession to the Convention.\r\nThe Russian Federation attaches great importance\r\nto the whole range of problems relating to mine action.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report, which reflects key milestones in\r\nimplementing the United Nations Mine Action\r\nStrategy. We support efforts made under the aegis of\r\nthe United Nations to mobilize the international\r\ncommunity to eliminate the consequences posed by the\r\ndanger of mines.\r\nRussia knows from bitter experience about the\r\ntragedy, the suffering caused by the uncontrolled use of\r\nmines. Despite the fact that more than half a century\r\nhas elapsed since the end of the Second World War,\r\neach year the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of\r\nEmergency Situations of Russia neutralize tens of\r\nthousands of pieces of ordinance. Unfortunately, today\r\nwe are also confronting more modern manifestations of\r\nthe dangers of mines. Russian soldiers are falling\r\nvictim to mines planted by terrorists in the territory of\r\nthe Chechen Republic. Our peacekeepers, in carrying\r\nout the crucial job of maintaining peace in the Georgia-\r\nAbkhaz conflict, are at the same time demining in the\r\narea of their responsibility. Nevertheless, more than ten\r\npeople were killed or injured as a result of exploding\r\nmines in that area.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General goes into\r\ndetail about steps being taken under the aegis of the\r\nUnited Nations in mine clearance operations in various\r\nparts of the world. Russia supports the inclusion in the\r\nmandates of United Nations peacekeeping operations,\r\nwhere this is necessary, of provisions in support of\r\ndemining. For our part, we are prepared to do whatever\r\nwe can to support these activities.\r\nI wish to inform you that in 2001-2002 Russia\r\nparticipated in a number of humanitarian demining\r\nprojects. Under contract with the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service in Kosovo, a territory of about 240,000\r\nmeters was demined. During the rebuilding of the\r\nSalang tunnel in Afghanistan, more than 4,000 mines\r\nand explosives were removed and rendered harmless.\r\nTogether with our Spanish colleagues, a project is\r\nunder way to train Afghan field engineers, and in fact\r\n75 people have already been trained. Further, a project\r\nto demine a section of the Syrian-Turkish border is\r\nnow being developed. We are prepared to play a\r\npractical role in demining operations under the Action\r\nPlan for Africa that was endorsed at the G8 Summit in\r\nKananaskis.\r\nThe activities I have described are being carried\r\nout, inter alia, on the basis of a decree adopted by the\r\nRussian Government dealing with measures to ensure\r\nparticipation by the Russian Federation in international\r\nhumanitarian demining programmes, operations and\r\nprojects which regulate questions relating to the\r\nprovision of assistance to other States in the area of\r\nmine action.\r\nWe support the conclusions contained in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report regarding the need to\r\nelaborate national strategies to deal with the problem of\r\nmines. Russia’s participation in mine clearance\r\nactivities clearly attests to our commitment to\r\ninternational obligations in the area of dealing with\r\nanti-personnel mines, as well as our readiness to help\r\novercome the negative consequences of regional crises.\r\nThe Russian Federation believes that banning the\r\nproduction, use, stockpiling and transfer of anti-\r\npersonnel mines should be the ultimate goal of the\r\ninternational community. Here we advocate the gradual\r\npursuit of this goal through a number of stages by\r\nensuring the largest possible participation of States in\r\nAmended Protocol II, prohibiting or restricting the use\r\nof mines, booby-traps and other devices, of the 1980\r\nConvention on certain conventional weapons. The\r\nbasis of this document is a carefully honed balance\r\nwhich reflects the security and self-defence interests of\r\nStates. We attach great importance to the holding in\r\nGeneva in December of this year of a meeting of the\r\nState Parties to this Protocol.\r\nAt the same time we think it is important to\r\ncontinue to work together with States Parties to the\r\nOttawa Convention and we deem important joint\r\nprojects in the area of humanitarian demining which\r\nprovide good opportunities for this.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress our readiness\r\nto continue our cooperation with the United Nations\r\nand its various structures in mine action activities, both\r\nin peacekeeping operations and during post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation of States.\r\nMr. Kulyk (Ukraine): The issue of mine action\r\nhas been on the agenda of the General Assembly since\r\n1993. Since the Ottawa Convention entered into force\r\nin March 1999, the use, stockpiling, production and\r\ntransfer of anti-personnel landmines have dramatically\r\nbeen reduced. Notwithstanding these remarkable\r\nachievements, landmines continue to be deployed each\r\nyear at greater risk to local populations. This adds to\r\nthe large number of mines and other unexploded\r\nordnance left as a result of armed conflicts and thus\r\nunderscores the urgent need for a significant increase\r\nin mine clearing efforts by the international community\r\nin order to eliminate existing threats.\r\nIn this regard, it is absolutely necessary to\r\nconvince all parties to halt new deployments of anti-\r\npersonnel mines in order to ensure the effectiveness\r\nand efficiency of mine clearance operations.\r\nWhile progress has been made in the ratification\r\nprocess of the Ottawa Convention, its universalization\r\nremains a serious challenge. More and more countries,\r\nincluding Ukraine, are now facing the need to\r\nimplement in full the relevant obligations. Accordingly,\r\nwhile advocacy to stigmatize the use of landmines\r\ncontinues, efforts now should also concentrate on\r\ngreater support to countries for the implementation of\r\ntheir specific treaty obligations.\r\nUkraine considers mine action to be an important\r\ncomponent of United Nations humanitarian activities.\r\nLandmines are first and foremost a humanitarian\r\nconcern and must be addressed from this perspective.\r\nIn this regard, we are encouraged by the work that has\r\nbeen done over the past year by the United Nations\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nDevelopment Programme and the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service (UNMAS), as well as a number of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. We would like to\r\nemphasize the role of UNMAS as the focal point for\r\nmine action within the United Nations system. We\r\nrecognize the progress made over the last 12 months in\r\nthis field, particularly in terms of strategic planning,\r\noperational support and information management.\r\nPublic and political awareness of landmines problems\r\nhave become widespread. The development of new\r\nstandards and mechanisms has strengthened\r\ninternational confidence in the integrity and value of\r\nmine action. It is important that advocacy against the\r\nuse of anti-personnel landmines remains a priority\r\ngoal.\r\nEncouraging progress has been achieved in the\r\nimplementation of almost all six strategic goals and\r\nrelated objectives outlined in the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Strategy for the period 2001-2005, submitted by\r\nthe Secretary-General in October 2001, namely in the\r\nfollowing areas: interagency assessment missions to\r\nthe mine-affected countries and production of\r\ninformation related to mine action problems;\r\nfinalization of a rapid response plan to meet mine\r\naction requirements in emergencies and the conduct of\r\nmine action programmes in United Nations mandated\r\noperations; further development and application of\r\ninternational mine action standards; and continued\r\nadvocacy and support for the universalization and\r\nimplementation of the main international Convention\r\non the subject.\r\nThe United Nations Mine Action Strategy has\r\nbecome a useful instrument, and it should be further\r\noptimized by taking into consideration the impact of\r\nthe landmine problem on the development of States.\r\nThe first year of its implementation has also\r\ndemonstrated the need for a more systematic approach\r\nand for the definition of clear objectives in the overall\r\nspectrum of mine action activities. The development of\r\nthe International Mine Action Standards is a step\r\nforward towards safe and effective demining. We hope\r\nthat these standards will be officially circulated among\r\nthe Member States and translated into many languages,\r\nand that they will be accepted as the main instrument\r\nfor conducting mine action activities. We also see merit\r\nin conducting, during the coming year, a review of\r\ncertain specific standards that are deemed too onerous.\r\nWhile important progress has been made in mine\r\naction during the past five years, the number of\r\ncountries and areas that require and request assistance\r\nalso continues to increase. The need to obtain adequate\r\nresources remains a constant challenge for the United\r\nNations. Therefore, the sustained commitment of all\r\nthose involved in the relevant international efforts is\r\nrequired. The timely mobilization of resources from\r\ndonors is essential to the success of mine action\r\nprogrammes.\r\nWe note with appreciation the fact that last year\r\nthe technical, material and financial resources needed\r\nto meet the costs associated with mine clearance\r\nactivities became more available, but the overall\r\nshortfall in funding remains a concern.\r\nSince the vast majority of humanitarian mine\r\naction activities are funded from voluntary\r\ncontributions, an effective and well-coordinated\r\nfunding strategy between the United Nations and the\r\ndonor community remains of crucial importance.\r\nUkraine deeply appreciates the commitment and\r\nthe generosity demonstrated by many States Members\r\nof the United Nations, as well as by numerous\r\norganizations inside and outside of the United Nations\r\nsystem, to assist it with the implementation of its\r\nOttawa Convention obligations.\r\nUkraine has extensive experience in modern\r\ndemining technologies, and its advanced logistics base\r\nallows for the training of highly skilled specialists\r\nwithin a short period of time. Ukrainian mine clearance\r\nengineers are widely recognized in various regions of\r\nthe world, including the former Yugoslavia, Angola,\r\nSierra Leone and Lebanon. The Ukrainian units operate\r\nunder United Nations standards and operational\r\nprocedures, and we are ready to provide technical\r\nsupport to, and share our experience with, the United\r\nNations missions in various countries.\r\nWith respect to the issue of mine clearance,\r\nUkraine would like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to another important aspect of the problem:\r\nunexploded ordnance and remnants of war. Ukraine,\r\nlike many States in the region, is affected to a\r\nconsiderable extent by the presence in its soil of\r\nunexploded remnants of past wars. According to\r\nstatistics, in the past five years our mine cleaners have\r\nneutralized over 50,000 explosive devices in the\r\nterritory of Ukraine. We have invited United Nations\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nMine Action Service specialists to carry out an\r\nindependent assessment of the scale of this problem.\r\nWe have also started preparatory work aimed at\r\nestablishing a national mine action centre. In this\r\nregard, we call for the continuation of the efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations to foster the establishment of mine\r\naction capacities in countries in which unexploded\r\nordnance constitutes a serious threat to the safety,\r\nhealth and lives of the local population.\r\nTremendous humanitarian development problems\r\ncaused by the presence of mines and other unexploded\r\nordnance continue to constitute an obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment of many States and have serious and long-\r\nlasting social and economic consequences, most of all\r\nfor the peoples of the mine-affected countries. We\r\nbelieve that the issue of mine clearance should remain\r\na priority in the global anti-mine action campaign.\r\nMr. Moesby (Denmark): I have the honour to\r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union. The Central\r\nand Eastern European countries associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated countries\r\nCyprus and Malta, as well as the European Free Trade\r\nAssociation (EFTA) country of the European Economic\r\nArea — Iceland — align themselves with this\r\nstatement.\r\nAllow me to begin by paying tribute to all those\r\ninvolved in combating anti-personnel landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance around the world. Allow me in\r\nparticular to commend the relentless efforts by the\r\naffected communities themselves; the Standing\r\nCommittees and States parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention; the United Nations Mine Action Service\r\nand all relevant United Nations agencies; the Mine\r\nAction Support Group; the International Campaign to\r\nBan Landmines and its many affiliated non-\r\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs); the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross; the Geneva International\r\nCentre for Humanitarian Demining; and all other\r\ninstitutions and organizations united in their common\r\ncause to decrease human suffering and increase human\r\nsecurity.\r\nAnti-personnel landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance continue to inflict death and injury all over\r\nthe world. There are an estimated 15,000 to 20,000\r\nmine casualties every year, and most often innocent\r\ncivilians are the victims. We must not forget that\r\nassistance in mine action, before anything else, is about\r\nsaving lives and reducing human suffering. Each step\r\nshould contribute to fulfilling this aim. But landmines\r\nand unexploded ordnance also have serious secondary\r\nsocial and economic consequences. The mutilation of\r\nvictims places a heavy burden on countries already\r\nstruggling to make ends meet. In post-conflict\r\nsocieties, landmines and unexploded ordnance impede\r\neconomic recovery and development by preventing\r\npeople from returning to their homes and working their\r\nland.\r\nResponsibility for addressing the problem of\r\nlandmines and unexploded ordnance rests with the\r\nauthorities of mine-affected countries. But acquiring\r\nthe necessary institutional means to deal effectively\r\nwith the problem sometimes poses a formidable\r\nchallenge. When national resources are lacking, the\r\nsuffering caused by anti-personnel landmines and\r\nunexploded ordnance needs to be addressed within a\r\nhumanitarian and development framework. The United\r\nNations can play an important role in both.\r\nAllow me in this context to commend the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on assistance in mine\r\naction. The report constitutes an important element of a\r\nmore systematic and coordinated approach to\r\ninternational assistance in mine action. The European\r\nUnion and its partners welcome the progress described\r\nin the report and support the measures undertaken by\r\nthe Secretary-General to optimize the United Nations\r\nMine Action Strategy for 2001-2005.\r\nWe deem particularly praiseworthy the readiness\r\nby the United Nations immediately to implement\r\nsuggestions by Member States regarding cooperation\r\nand coordination; integration and prioritization; scope\r\nof mine action; political commitment; and information\r\nsharing.\r\nImportant progress has been reported regarding\r\nthe six strategic goals of the Mine Action Strategy.\r\nThis progress includes improvements in information\r\nmanagement; finalization of a rapid-response plan;\r\ndevelopment of national mine action plans;\r\nimplementation of surveys; and steps towards\r\nimproved institutional coordination and integration of\r\nmine action into overall assistance and development\r\nschemes.\r\nSuch measures are all very encouraging and\r\nclearly demonstrate that assistance in mine action is\r\nmoving in the right direction. Particularly encouraging\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nare the steps towards greater national ownership,\r\nsustainability and overall integration of mine-action\r\nprogrammes into wider relief, rehabilitation,\r\nreconstruction and development efforts. The\r\nformulation of national mine-action strategies, and the\r\nintegration of these into national relief and\r\nreconstruction plans, are wholeheartedly encouraged.\r\nHowever, as stated by the Secretary-General in\r\nhis conclusions, more needs to be done. Placing\r\nhumanitarian mine action within the mainstream of\r\nhumanitarian and development assistance requires\r\nfurther integration at all levels. For its part, the\r\nEuropean Union will promote such measures through\r\nits support to socio-economic impact studies and\r\nlandmine impact surveys and through its partnerships\r\nwith affected communities and Governments and\r\nhumanitarian and development actors.\r\nLong-term development objectives and a firm\r\npolitical commitment by national authorities are crucial\r\nto the success of assistance in mine action. Mine-action\r\nprogrammes will eventually reach a stage at which the\r\nmost acute threat to populations and economies has\r\nbeen countered or contained, whether through risk\r\neducation, clearance or marking. At that stage, mine\r\naction will gradually develop into a more\r\nrehabilitation- and development-oriented activity. This\r\nhas important implications for issues of prioritization,\r\nnational ownership and funding. It is important that\r\nnational mine-action strategies be set up with a view to\r\nensuring effective decision-making about short-,\r\nmedium- and long-term priorities. National and\r\ninternational support for mine action must be\r\nsustainable and must encourage and support national\r\ninitiatives and institutions. The need to devote greater\r\nattention to transition strategies, as recommended by\r\nthe Secretary-General, is highly relevant if the lasting\r\nand constructive impact of mine action is to be\r\npromoted.\r\nThe needs of the mine-affected community must\r\nset the basic parameters for assistance in mine action.\r\nThe allure of operational mine clearance should not\r\ndeflect attention from other, equally relevant, aspects\r\nof mine action: advocacy; mine-risk education; victim\r\nassistance; mapping, surveying and marking; and\r\nstockpile destruction. The shift of emphasis in the\r\nmethodology of landmine impact surveys, described in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, from square metres and\r\nstatistics to real-life socio-economic impact, is highly\r\ndesirable. Placing landmines and unexploded ordnance\r\nin their proper social context makes assistance in mine\r\naction more sensitive to the requirements of affected\r\ncommunities.\r\nThe European Union and its associated partners\r\nbelieve that anti-personnel landmines and unexploded\r\nordnance need to be dealt with locally and globally —\r\nlocally, through community-based and national efforts;\r\nand globally, through the Ottawa Convention, through\r\nthe United Nations system and through international\r\ncooperation and coordination. Allow me in this context\r\nto commend the chairmanship of the Mine Action\r\nSupport Group for its efforts in coordinating donor\r\nsupport. The European Union will devote itself to\r\nfurthering international coordination and cooperation\r\non mine action and to forging partnerships with all\r\nrelevant institutions and actors, not least those in mine-\r\naffected countries.\r\nThe European Union will continue its firm\r\nsupport for the universal and speedy implementation of\r\nthe Ottawa Convention and the work relating to\r\nProtocol II of the Convention on Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons (CCW). It is a testimony to the success and\r\nmomentum of the Ottawa Convention that 130 States\r\nhave acceded to the treaty. The public advocacy\r\nstrategy envisaged in the Secretary-General’s report\r\nshould support this process and build on existing\r\nnetworks, with a view to strengthening cooperation\r\nwith actors already engaged in advocacy and\r\nuniversalization.\r\nThe European Union will work for greater\r\ncollaboration and coherence in international assistance\r\nto mine action. By pledging a total of 240 million euros\r\nin support of mine action for the period 2002-2009, the\r\nEuropean Union has become one of the world’s leading\r\ndonors in this sector. Bilateral assistance from\r\nindividual EU member States further emphasizes the\r\nprominent role played by the European Union in\r\ninternational assistance to mine action.\r\nThat important commitment was underpinned by\r\nthe adoption in July 2001 of two European Community\r\n(EC) regulations on action against anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. The regulations provide for an integrated\r\nand focused EC strategy for assistance in mine action,\r\nin addition to a multi-annual programming plan for\r\n2002-2004, which is currently being finalized. The EC\r\nstrategy is written in response to the Ottawa\r\nConvention and is closely related to the United Nations\r\nmine-action strategy for 2001-2005. The EC strategy\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nstates as one of its key principles that EC support to\r\nhumanitarian mine action must further the objectives of\r\nthe international community and promote the\r\neffectiveness and efficiency of international assistance\r\nin mine action. Assistance through the common EC\r\nbudget will therefore seek to complement and reinforce\r\nmeasures already undertaken by the international\r\ncommunity — by supporting activities which enhance\r\ncoordination, management, efficiency and\r\neffectiveness.\r\nThe European Union and its partners firmly\r\nbelieve that international law and assistance in mine\r\naction will help mitigate the disastrous humanitarian,\r\nsocial and economic consequences of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines and unexploded ordnance throughout the\r\nworld. The European Union and its partners therefore\r\nurge all Member States to join the international mine-\r\naction community in a sustained and global effort to\r\ncurtail the suffering caused by these indiscriminate\r\nweapons. Step by step, mine by mine, assistance in\r\nmine action — based on partnership and dialogue —\r\nwill bring us closer to that objective.\r\nMr. Rivas (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nshould like first of all to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his report (A/57/430) on this item, which describes\r\nthe progress made in consolidating the strategic goals\r\nand related objectives outlined in the United Nations\r\nMine Action Strategy for 2001-2005.\r\n“During the course of this meeting today, at least\r\ntwo Colombians will become victims of anti-personnel\r\nlandmines in our territory.” Those were the heart-\r\nrending words of Mr. Francisco Santos, Vice-President\r\nof the Republic of Colombia, speaking at a recent\r\ninternational forum in Bogota on challenges posed by\r\nanti-personnel mines in my country. And it is those\r\nwords that I would like to recall in speaking to the\r\nAssembly this morning as we undertake an overall\r\nassessment of the current threat that anti-personnel\r\nlandmines continue to pose in Colombia, as well as an\r\noverview of the actions taken by my Government in\r\nfighting this serious problem.\r\nIt is impossible to come up with a precise figure\r\nfor the number of anti-personnel landmines currently in\r\nColombian territory. Approximate figures based on\r\nstudies undertaken in recent years, however, suggest\r\nthat there are about 100,000 such mines, most of which\r\nare concentrated in four departments of our country —\r\nareas where the Colombian Government has exerted\r\nmajor efforts during the past five years in an endeavour\r\nto permanently and definitively eradicate these cruel\r\nartefacts, sadly referred to as “hidden sentinels” and\r\n“enemies who do not sleep”. Its aim is also to create, in\r\na parallel way, a culture of prevention with regard to\r\nfuture anti-personnel mine accidents, as well as a\r\ncomprehensive rehabilitation strategy for mine victims\r\nwith respect to their role in society.\r\nOn 6 September 2001, in the framework of the\r\nMillennium Summit, Colombia demonstrated its firm\r\ncommitment to the eradication of anti-personnel mines\r\nby depositing its instrument of ratification of the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction — commonly known as the\r\nOttawa Convention — thus becoming the 103rd State\r\nParty to that instrument. However, the initiatives\r\nundertaken to prevent and eradicate their use in\r\nColombia date back several years. In 1996, the\r\nColombian military industry (INDUMIL) definitively\r\nsuspended the manufacture of anti-personnel mines and\r\nproceeded to dismantle and destroy their production\r\nfacilities.\r\nSince we became a State party to the Ottawa\r\nConvention, our commitment has been demonstrated\r\nthrough equally tangible results. In conformity with\r\nthat important Convention, we created, in January this\r\nyear, the National Authority for Mine Action, an inter-\r\ninstitutional committee at the highest level, headed by\r\nthe Vice-President of the Republic and composed of\r\nvarious State and non-State entities that enriched with\r\ntheir views and their experiences the planning of\r\nstrategies to completely eliminate mines in Colombia.\r\nLikewise, Colombia has participated actively and\r\nconsistently in the four Meetings of States Parties that\r\nhave taken place since 1999, held at Maputo,\r\nMozambique; at Managua, Nicaragua; and at Geneva,\r\nSwitzerland. I should add that, since last year, my\r\ncountry has been submitting the annual report required\r\nunder article 7 of the Ottawa Convention, summarizing\r\nactions undertaken within the framework of that\r\ninternational instrument.\r\nNone of those things would have been possible\r\nwithout the invaluable support and cooperation of the\r\ninternational community throughout the process. Two\r\ncountries in particular — Switzerland and Canada —\r\nstand out among the nations that truly worked in\r\npartnership with the Government of Colombia during\r\nthe implementation of the Ottawa Convention, through\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\ntheir constant and committed assistance, through the\r\nsharing of experience with regard to creating the\r\nNational Authority and through the technical\r\ncooperation of experts on anti-personnel mine action.\r\nAlso worthy of mention is the Geneva International\r\nCentre for Humanitarian Demining, which bases its\r\nwork on the contributions of various industrialized\r\ncountries and of international organizations, such as the\r\nUnited Nations, and is currently the leading authority\r\nand the focus of every world initiative on the subject.\r\nThe United Nations has generously offered its\r\nassistance to find a solution to this problem through\r\npossible future visits by the United Nations Mine\r\nAction Service. My country welcomes the\r\nOrganization’s willingness in that regard, and the\r\ninhabitants of the affected areas will especially\r\nappreciate any assistance that we may receive.\r\nHowever, much remains to be done. Lawless\r\narmed groups continue to plant anti-personnel mines\r\nindiscriminately in Colombian territory. The sad, long-\r\nterm effects of only one of those artefacts — or of the\r\nmere suspicion of their presence — on an entire\r\npopulation are well known. Not only do anti-personnel\r\nmines profoundly affect the physical and psychological\r\nintegrity of entire populations, but their negative\r\nimpact has the most serious collateral effects, such as\r\nthe unusability of farmable land and the destruction of\r\nnatural resources and of goods and services, among\r\nmany other things. In addition, the rehabilitation of\r\nvictims implies higher costs for the State and\r\nirreparably damages the relationships of victims with\r\ntheir families and with society. That has results so\r\nprofound that they affect a multitude of people besides\r\nthose who suffered the direct consequences of the\r\naccident.\r\nIn the first nine months of this year, 459 people\r\nfell victim to anti-personnel mines in Colombia — that\r\nis, two victims per day, as I noted at the beginning of\r\nmy statement, echoing the words of the Vice-President\r\nof the Republic. Sadly, 50 per cent of the civilian\r\nvictims tend to be children, some of whom endure\r\namputation of one of their limbs, but many of whom\r\nlose their lives instantly or after painful agony.\r\nAddressing this item on the agenda constitutes a\r\nspace for reflection and a platform for finding joint\r\nsolutions to a problem of such magnitude. The effort to\r\ntotally eliminate anti-personnel mines has facilitated an\r\nimportant rapprochement among the various sectors of\r\nthe State and of civil society. But such efforts require\r\nadditional support that the international community and\r\ninternational organizations such as the United Nations\r\nare capable of providing. Colombia will highly\r\nappreciate any initiative of the Organization in that\r\nregard. Only thus will we be able to look to the future\r\non the basis of the very objective that is our common\r\ndenominator: a world free of anti-personnel mines.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I am pleased to express our thanks and\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the report\r\nsubmitted under this agenda item concerning assistance\r\nin mine action (A/57/430). That report emphasizes the\r\ncontinued global commitment to achieving progress\r\nwith regard to mine action and highlights objectives,\r\nprogress made and imminent challenges.\r\nLandmines are a global humanitarian problem\r\nwhose solution requires the coordination of\r\ninternational action at the levels of Government and\r\ncivil society. Mines are assassins in hiding to which\r\nvictims come. They are patient murderers that lie in\r\nwait for their victims even decades after the end of\r\nwars and conflicts, threatening the lives of innocent\r\ncivilians and hindering economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe global scourge of anti-personnel mines can\r\nbe illustrated through statistics. The total number of\r\nmines is estimated in the hundreds of millions, and\r\nthey are scattered over 90 States — that is, nearly half\r\nof all Member States — and each year claim some\r\n15,000 victims, the overwhelming majority of whom\r\nare civilians. In the face of that challenge, the United\r\nNations has adopted a set of measures aimed at\r\neliminating the scourge of mines. It has provided\r\ntechnical and financial assistance, established the\r\nUnited Nations Mine Action Service and an Internet\r\nweb site, and adopted a Mine Action Strategy of six\r\nobjectives.\r\nIn that context, the item on assistance in mine\r\naction was included on the agenda of the fifty-third\r\nsession of the General Assembly of 1993. Since then,\r\nthe General Assembly has adopted all of its resolutions\r\non this agenda item by consensus. We can thus say that\r\nthe countdown to the elimination of landmines has,\r\nindeed, begun. But further efforts are needed to achieve\r\nthe other goals.\r\nLebanon is one of the 90 States affected by\r\nlandmines. The Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon\r\nleft a large number of landmines, estimated by the\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nUnited Nations to be 450,000, scattered over an area of\r\n472 square kilometres — that is to say, about 5 per cent\r\nof the territory of Lebanon. Between May 2000 and the\r\nfirst half of 2002 those landmines claimed 35 lives and\r\nresulted in the injury of 192 other people, most of them\r\ncivilians, including a large number of children. In\r\naddition to the human loss, these landmines prevent a\r\nsector of the local population from returning to their\r\nland, impede the work of the United Nations Interim\r\nForce in Southern Lebanon (UNIFIL) and obstruct the\r\nGovernment’s development efforts. These mines also\r\nprevent the agricultural and industrial development of\r\nthese tracts of land. The Secretary-General spoke about\r\nthis problem in his most recent report to the Security\r\nCouncil on UNIFIL and described it as “a matter of\r\nutmost concern.” (S/2002/746, para. 16)\r\nFaced with this serious problem, the Government\r\nof Lebanon has moved to find appropriate solutions. It\r\nadopted a set of measures that, on the whole, were in\r\nline with the six strategic goals outlined in the United\r\nNations Mine Action Strategy for 2001-2005 and set\r\nout in last year’s report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/56/448/Add.1). In brief, the most important of these\r\nmeasures are the following. First, in line with the\r\nstrategic goal of putting in place national and local\r\ncapacities to plan and coordinate mine-action\r\nprogrammes, Lebanon has established a National\r\nOffice to Combat Landmines, whose staff includes a\r\nnumber of specialized officers from the Lebanese army.\r\nThe National Office is playing a pioneering role in\r\ncoordinating mine-action efforts by the Lebanese\r\nGovernment, the United Nations, the international\r\ncommunity and non-governmental organizations.\r\nSecondly, towards reaching the strategic goal of\r\nputting in place a rapid response capability to meet\r\nmine-action requirements in emergency situations, the\r\nUnited Nations and a number of individual countries\r\nresponded to Lebanon’s request for assistance in mine\r\nclearance and provided technical, material and\r\nfinancial assistance. Those countries and entities\r\ninclude the United States, the European Union, France,\r\nthe United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. In this\r\nregard, special mention must be made of the United\r\nArab Emirates, which donated $50 million.\r\nEarly this year, an anti-landmine coordination\r\ncentre for southern Lebanon was established with the\r\nparticipation of Lebanon, the United Nations and the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates. It manages and coordinates all\r\nmine-action activities. Two private companies have\r\nbeen contracted: Bactec International and Minetech\r\nInternational, which currently employ some 400\r\ndemining specialists in southern Lebanon. By the end\r\nof October, some 2.4 million square metres of land had\r\nbeen cleared and 17,793 anti-personnel landmines had\r\nbeen removed. However, it is not expected that those\r\ntwo private companies will finish their demining\r\nactivities in southern Lebanon for several years,\r\nespecially with the discovery of additional minefields.\r\nIn that regard, Lebanon reiterates its demand that Israel\r\nhand over all maps and documents relating to\r\nlandmines, in implementation of the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions, including the most recent, Council\r\nresolution 1428 (2002).\r\nThirdly, in line with the strategic goal of making\r\ninformation available to all, the National Office to\r\nCombat Landmines, in cooperation with a number of\r\nnon-governmental organizations in Lebanon, is\r\noffering counselling services and awareness-raising\r\nlessons on landmines for 150 schools in southern\r\nLebanon, with a total of some 50,000 students.\r\nIn conclusion, Lebanon, which appreciates the\r\nsolidarity of the international community regarding its\r\nlandmine problem, reaffirms its cooperation with the\r\ninternational community to eliminate this scourge. We\r\nexpress our thanks to all mine-action actors, such as the\r\nUnited Nations, its specialized agencies, States and\r\nnon-governmental organizations, which are all working\r\nhard to create a clean environment and a world free of\r\nlandmines.\r\nMr. Kasemsarn (Thailand): Thailand welcomes\r\nthe finding of the Landmine Monitor Report 2002 that\r\nthe number of casualties from anti-personnel mines\r\ncontinues to decrease each year. Nevertheless, we are\r\nconcerned that the number of victims of anti-personnel\r\nmines still remains high. Anti-personnel mines\r\ncontinue to pose a significant threat to human security.\r\nThey do not discriminate between combatants and\r\ncivilians, and randomly maim or kill innocent civilians,\r\nincluding women and children.\r\nBut the human costs do not represent the full\r\npicture of the landmine problem. Mines have also taken\r\na heavy toll on wildlife and endangered species. The\r\npresence of landmines deters tourism and inhibits\r\ncloser people-to-people contacts in certain areas. It\r\nposes an obstacle to infrastructure development, such\r\nas the construction of roads and railways. In sum,\r\nlandmines impede a country’s capacity to pursue\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nsustainable development. Scarce resources which could\r\nbe used to promote further economic development have\r\nto be channelled to support important mine-action\r\nactivities, such as mine clearance and victim\r\nrehabilitation. The establishment of a mine-free world\r\nand the universalization of the Ottawa process as one\r\nof the primary means to totally eliminate anti-\r\npersonnel mines are thus an important and worthy\r\nundertaking for the international community.\r\nThat is why Thailand welcomed the adoption last\r\nyear of the United Nations Mine Action Strategy for\r\n2001-2005. In that regard, we appreciate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/57/430) on assistance in mine\r\naction, which reviews the first year of implementation\r\nof the six strategic goals and related objectives outlined\r\nin the United Nations Mine Action Strategy for 2001-\r\n2005. In view of the large number of organizations and\r\nagencies dealing with the various aspects of the\r\nlandmine problem, Thailand supports the emphasis\r\nplaced on the coordinating role of the United Nations\r\nin the fight against landmines and the call for effective\r\npartnerships. We note with concern the conclusion in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report that the planned\r\ntransition of mine action activities to national\r\nresponsibility has in some cases been hampered by the\r\ninability of donors to continue funding programmes\r\nafter such transfer. Discontinuation of such funding\r\nshould not take place.\r\nThe challenge posed by anti-personnel mines to\r\nhumanity is far too great for any one country to face\r\nalone. For affected developing countries in particular,\r\ninternational assistance and cooperation remain a vital\r\ncomponent of their respective national strategies for\r\ndealing with the mine issue in all its aspects. This high-\r\nlevel political commitment to international assistance\r\nfor affected developing countries was reaffirmed at the\r\nFourth Meeting of States Parties to the Ottawa\r\nConvention, held in Geneva in September 2002.\r\nDespite its limited resources, Thailand has been at the\r\nforefront of efforts to tackle the landmine issue at the\r\nnational, regional and global levels. But we readily\r\nadmit that we would not have achieved many of our\r\nobjectives were it not for the assistance and\r\ncooperation we have received from a variety of\r\npartners, including international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nAt the national level, Thailand has destroyed a\r\nfurther 120,000 mines in its stockpiles, while work is\r\nprogressing steadily in clearing mines in the field. A\r\nthird humanitarian mine action unit to be based in the\r\nprovince of Surin in the north-eastern part of Thailand\r\nhas been established, with the assistance of the United\r\nStates, to undertake mine victim assistance and mine\r\nrisk education activities. We are in the process of\r\ntransferring some of the mine action expertise and\r\nexperience from the military to civilian components.\r\nTo enhance coordination of mine action activities\r\nnationwide, the National Mine Action Committee was\r\nrevived. The United Nations Mine Action Service has\r\nhelped promote greater awareness of the International\r\nMine Action Standard (IMAS) in Thailand, and we are\r\nin the process of studying IMAS carefully. Thailand is\r\nparticularly grateful to Canada for providing assistance\r\nin the form of mine detectors and to Japan for\r\nproviding funds through the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme to support the project on\r\nfacilitating the national mine action programme in\r\nThailand.\r\nAt the regional level, Thailand, with the\r\nassistance of the United States, hosted a regional\r\nworkshop on mine action technologies for the Asia-\r\nPacific region in March, to exchange experiences in\r\nmine action activities. In May of this year, Thailand, in\r\ncooperation with Canada, Australia and Japan,\r\norganized a regional seminar on landmines, which was\r\nattended by South-East Asian countries to promote\r\ngreater mine awareness in the region and to explore\r\nfurther mine action activities in the future. Such\r\nactivities should help encourage the participation of\r\nmore countries in the Ottawa process.\r\nAt the global level, Thailand will host the Fifth\r\nMeeting of the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention\r\nfrom 15 to 19 September next year. In that connection,\r\nan advance team led by Ambassador Jean Lint of\r\nBelgium, President of the Fourth Meeting of States\r\nParties to the Ottawa Convention, will be in Thailand\r\nlater this month to make preparations in coordination\r\nwith the Thai side to ensure the success of the Fifth\r\nMeeting of States Parties. The Meeting will provide an\r\nopportunity for States parties to, among other things,\r\ntake stock of the progress made in mine action,\r\nexchange experiences in approaches to dealing with the\r\nlandmine problem, examine the practical challenges\r\nfaced by affected developing countries in dealing with\r\nthe landmine problem and explore new avenues for\r\ninternational cooperation and assistance. I should like\r\nto take this opportunity to invite States parties and\r\nothers to join us in Bangkok for that meeting, the first\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\never to be held in Asia. I also wish to take this\r\nopportunity to thank The Honourable Bruce Scott of\r\nAustralia for his kind words regarding Thailand’s\r\ninitiative on mine action.\r\nOur national experience has shown that global\r\npartnerships involving donor States, affected\r\ndeveloping States, international organizations and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations are necessary for affected\r\ndeveloping States to have a fighting chance to tackle\r\nthe multifaceted problem posed by anti-personnel\r\nmines. The call for affected developing countries to\r\nundertake greater national responsibility in resolving\r\nthe landmine problem, therefore, should be\r\naccompanied by a commitment to greater international\r\nassistance for and cooperation with them. The need for\r\nsuch assistance is even greater for those affected\r\ndeveloping countries that are concurrently experiencing\r\nextreme poverty and economic hardship.\r\nSimilar partnerships must be forged at the\r\nnational level so that mine action becomes a truly\r\nnational endeavour. Close cooperation between military\r\nunits — which in many countries have the most\r\nexpertise in mine clearance and other activities —\r\ncivilian groups and local non-governmental\r\norganizations is a vital ingredient of a successful\r\nnational effort. International support and assistance\r\nshould take into account those different national\r\napproaches to dealing with the landmine issue and\r\nshould be tailor-made, as appropriate, to the local\r\nsituation.\r\nThailand thus intends to continue forging those\r\nvital partnerships, at the national, regional and global\r\nlevels, to create a mine-free world and to generate\r\nadequate international cooperation and assistance to\r\nhelp achieve this common goal for humanity.\r\nMr. Son (Republic of Korea): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to express my appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report (A/57/430) on\r\nthe progress made in this, the first year of\r\nimplementation of the United Nations Mine Action\r\nStrategy for 2001-2005.\r\nAs indicated in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\nthe definable set of objectives laid out in the five-year\r\nStrategy has provided an effective framework for\r\nsteadily achieving and monitoring progress in the field\r\nof mine action. Since the issue of mine action was\r\nadopted as an agenda item of the General Assembly in\r\n1993, the efforts of the international community to\r\ntackle the problem have brought greater public and\r\npolitical awareness to the issues surrounding\r\nlandmines. As a result, we have seen a decrease in the\r\nproduction and use of anti-personnel landmines, a de\r\nfacto moratorium on the transfer of such weapons, the\r\nclearing of many mined areas and the destruction of\r\nmillions of stockpiled landmines. Most important, in\r\nrecent years there has been a significant decline in the\r\nnumber of mine-related casualties.\r\nWhile this progress is laudable, we must not lose\r\nsight of all that is still to be achieved. Landmines\r\ncontinue to pose a deadly threat to innocent civilians in\r\nconflict and post-conflict areas, not only claiming\r\nlives, but also impeding socio-economic development,\r\nreconstruction efforts and humanitarian aid operations.\r\nIn response, the five-year Strategy employs a\r\ncomprehensive approach to coordinating progress\r\ntoward the goals of mine awareness, emergency\r\nassistance, mine clearance and resource mobilization,\r\nwhich are essential to countering that threat.\r\nLet me take a few moments to comment on some\r\nof the latest developments in mine action to which,\r\namong many other things, my delegation attaches\r\nparticular importance.\r\nFirst, recognizing that the comprehensive\r\ncollection and management of information is essential\r\nfor effective mine action, my delegation welcomes the\r\nnew and expanded missions undertaken by the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in conjunction\r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) and other agencies to assess the needs of\r\nmine-affected countries. We further commend the\r\ncontinued development and maintenance of the E-Mine\r\ninformation network and hope to see the integration of\r\nadditional resources similar to the Stockpile\r\nDestruction Resource into the E-Mine network as it\r\nbecomes the centre for mine-related information on the\r\nInternet.\r\nSecondly, with regard to mine action emergency\r\nresponse, my delegation notes with satisfaction the\r\ndevelopment of the rapid response plan and the further\r\nintegration of emergency capabilities into the existing\r\nmechanisms. Moreover, we are confident that the plan\r\nto address the need for threat monitoring and\r\ncontingency planning, currently being developed for\r\neventual incorporation into the rapid response plan,\r\nwill bolster emergency response capabilities.\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nThirdly, as highlighted in the Secretary-General’s\r\nconclusions, efforts to build effective partnerships with\r\ninternational organizations, with a view to harmonizing\r\ntheir mine action activities with humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment efforts, are crucial to the success of the\r\nfight against landmines. Close cooperation among all\r\nstakeholders continues to be indispensable, not only in\r\ncoordinating activities and sharing best practices but\r\nalso in mobilizing resources. In that regard, my\r\ndelegation would like to stress the importance of the\r\ncentral coordinating role of the United Nations in\r\ngenerating synergy among diverse actors. In particular,\r\nwe fully support the efforts of UNMAS, which has\r\nserved as the focal point for international mine action\r\nactivities.\r\nMr. Laotegguelnodji (Chad), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is committed to the global\r\neffort to protect civilians from the scourge of\r\nlandmines. Since 1997, the Korean Government has\r\nfaithfully enforced an indefinite extension of its\r\nmoratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines. Last\r\nyear, my Government acceded to the Convention on\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons and its Amended\r\nProtocol II. Furthermore, last September, in\r\ncooperation with North Korea, we undertook mine-\r\nclearing operations within the demilitarized zone of the\r\nKorean peninsula to reconnect the railways and roads\r\nwhose use had been suspended between the South and\r\nthe North for the past five decades.\r\nIn closing, the Republic of Korea recognizes that\r\none of the prerequisites for effective action is a\r\nsubstantial resource base, and has thus provided\r\nsupport to various United-Nations-led mine assistance\r\nprogrammes. My Government has made annual\r\ncontributions to the Voluntary Trust Fund for\r\nAssistance in Mine Action and remains an active\r\nparticipant in the Mine Action Support Group. We\r\nshare the Secretary-General’s view that the United\r\nNations should secure sound funding to meet the\r\ngrowing requests from mine-affected countries. With\r\nthat in mind, the Korean Government will continue to\r\nmake due contributions to this noble cause.\r\nMr. Amer (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) (spoke in\r\nArabic): Today’s debate in the General Assembly on\r\nassistance in mine action is another attempt to call the\r\ninternational community’s attention to the danger of\r\nthe landmines laid in more than 60 countries, which\r\nkill or permanently disable thousands of individuals,\r\nincluding women and children. Landmines also cause\r\neconomic, social and environmental destruction in\r\nthose countries, hindering their attempts to achieve\r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/57/430)\r\nemphasizes, first, the progress made in the\r\nimplementation of the six strategic goals and related\r\nobjectives included in the United Nations Mine Action\r\nStrategy for 2001-2005. As stated in the report,\r\nprogress has been made in achieving these objectives\r\nin several areas. We welcome in particular the\r\ndistinguished work that United Nations programmes\r\nand agencies have carried out in my country and the\r\nconsultations and assistance they have provided to\r\nother States to enhance their efforts to end the human\r\ntragedy caused by these weapons. It is our hope that\r\nthe United Nations and its agencies will continue their\r\nsupport for national efforts to clear land affected by\r\nthese indiscriminate weapons, which kill innocent\r\npeople and cause immeasurable pain and damage.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General says that\r\namong the goals for the coming period is the\r\nuniversalization and implementation of the Convention\r\nof the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production,\r\nand Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction. My delegation recognizes this approach as\r\nan international milestone on the path to freeing\r\nhumanity of this deadly scourge. Nonetheless, it has to\r\nbe recognized that it will be difficult to achieve this\r\ngoal unless the concerns expressed by Member States,\r\nincluding my own, are fully taken into consideration.\r\nThose States have expressed reservations on the\r\nConvention related to the protection of national\r\nsecurity, especially that of countries that have no other\r\nmeans to protect their vast lands.\r\nMoreover, the Convention ignores several\r\nimportant issues, such as the legal responsibility of the\r\ncolonial countries that laid landmines in other\r\ncountries. The principle of responsibility has been\r\nstressed by several international and regional\r\norganizations including the Group of 77 and China,\r\nmeeting in Havana, and at the 1997 Harare meeting of\r\nthe Foreign Ministers of the Organization of African\r\nUnity. Those organizations have underlined the moral\r\nresponsibility of the countries that laid landmines\r\nduring the Second World War and during their colonial\r\nwars, and have called on those countries to make a\r\nreasonable contribution from their military budgets, to\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\noffer information, to help countries remove the mines\r\nand to assist mine victims. In the Final Document of\r\nthe twelfth Summit of the countries of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, held in Durban in 1998, the heads of State\r\nor Government expressed their grave concern at the\r\nimmeasurable human and material losses and harm to\r\ndevelopment plans that landmines have caused. They\r\ncalled on the countries that laid those mines to assume\r\ntheir responsibilities and help States by providing them\r\nwith information and maps showing the location of the\r\nlandmines and by providing technical assistance for\r\nclearing them, in addition to defraying the cost of\r\nclearing them and paying compensation for losses.\r\nMy country, Libya, has suffered and continues to\r\nsuffer from the problem of landmines and other\r\nordnance left from the Second World War. Reports of\r\nthe United Nations and other organizations have stated\r\nthat both Axis and allied forces laid millions of\r\nlandmines and pieces of explosive ordnance in North\r\nAfrica. These have killed or wounded thousands of\r\ninnocent people and have permanently disabled many\r\nothers, in addition to hindering efforts to combat\r\ndesertification, build roads, exploit natural resources\r\nand reclaim land for agriculture.\r\nMore than fifty years have passed since the\r\nSecond World War ended. There were victors and\r\nvanquished. Victorious and vanquished forces left our\r\ncountry, but the mines and the ordnance they planted\r\nremained, exploded from time to time by an innocent\r\nchild at play or by a rural woman tending to her sheep\r\nor by a wandering aged person returning to his home or\r\ntent. The loss of a life or an eye, or arm or leg — these\r\nare tragedies that repeat themselves daily because the\r\nwarring factions did not mark the locations of their\r\nmines, nor did they provide the Libyan authorities with\r\nmaps and information that show the fields where these\r\nmines were planted. This makes it difficult to clear\r\nthese mines.\r\nWhen we were debating the issue during the\r\nprevious session of this Assembly, my delegation\r\nmentioned the historical declaration by Libya and Italy\r\nin mid-1998, in which both countries agreed to\r\ncooperate in the clearance of landmines from Libyan\r\nterritory, to provide medical treatment and\r\ncompensation to those affected and to establish a joint\r\nfund for reconstruction of affected areas and a medical\r\ncentre for treating those maimed by landmines. The\r\nItalian side has already begun implementing part of this\r\ndeclaration and we look forward to the implementation\r\nof the rest of the declaration’s obligations. My\r\ndelegation wants to emphasize this declaration as an\r\nexcellent precedent, because it fulfils one of the\r\nprimary issues of our foreign policy which we have\r\nexpressed on several occasions. Today and from this\r\nforum we reiterate that we in Libya still hope that the\r\ntwo other countries that planted mines on Libyan\r\nterritory during the Second World War, Germany and\r\nBritain, will emulate the Italian approach and conclude\r\nagreements with Libya to assist Libyan authorities in\r\nsolving this problem and to compensate the Libyan\r\npeople for the damages they suffered as a result of the\r\nplanting of landmines more than five decades ago.\r\nThe large number of new and modern landmines\r\nthat are still buried in many countries reminds us that\r\nthe road ahead for the international community remains\r\nlong and tedious until we can provide total protection\r\nfor the innocent. Efforts made so far are encouraging.\r\nUnited Nations Member States need to renew their\r\ncommitment to clear all the areas affected by mines. In\r\nthis respect, my delegation believes it to be very\r\nimportant that some of the objectives of the United\r\nNations five-year Mine Action Strategy, and any other\r\nstrategies developed by the Organization, should be to\r\ndeal with the reservations expressed by several\r\nMember States regarding the provisions of the\r\nConvention and to conclude an additional protocol to\r\ndeal with aspects of security and with old and new\r\nlandmines and their harm to man and property.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): I am\r\ndelighted to see my dear friend once again in the\r\npresidential seat just as I take the floor. On behalf of\r\nthe delegation of Senegal, I wish to express gratitude to\r\nyou for your wise initiative in having today’s\r\ndiscussion focus on assistance in mine action. At the\r\nsame time I convey congratulations to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on his highly relevant report which talks of\r\nclear progress in attaining the objectives of the United\r\nNations Mine Action Strategy 2001-2005. This\r\nprogress is shown in the great improvement in the\r\nElectronic Mine Information Network, the\r\ndevelopment of a rapid response plan to deal with\r\nemergency situations and the increased adaptation of\r\ninternational standards in the area of mine action.\r\nThe serious human and economic toll that has\r\nresulted from this terrible scourge shocks us and poses\r\nan ongoing challenge to the international community.\r\nWhen we look at the figures, which are nonetheless\r\ndeemed to be optimistic, we are confronted with a\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nwrenching fact — there are between 60-70 million\r\nlandmines buried in some 90 countries in the world,\r\ndisabling someone every 22 minutes with an annual\r\ntotal of 26,000 people who are maimed. In addition to\r\nthe serious physical and psychological damage caused,\r\nthese devices kill innocent civilians, destroy the\r\neconomies of many societies and threaten for the long\r\nterm the security of areas where they proliferate. This\r\nis a grim picture in which, unfortunately, here too,\r\nAfrica is the most affected continent.\r\nMr. Kofi Annan was right when he stated in April\r\n1999:\r\n“From my experience in peacekeeping, I\r\nhave seen first-hand the literally crippling effects\r\nof landmines and unexploded ordnance on people\r\nand communities alike. Not only do these\r\nabominable weapons lie buried in silence and in\r\ntheir millions, waiting to kill or maim innocent\r\nwomen and children; but the presence — or even\r\nthe fear of the presence — of a single landmine\r\ncan prevent the cultivation of an entire field, or\r\nrob a whole village of its livelihood, place yet\r\nanother obstacle on a country’s road to\r\nreconstruction and development.”\r\nSo when they adopted the New Economic\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, African leaders\r\nobviously did not lose sight of the crucial role of\r\npromoting peace and security on the continent through\r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Organization for African\r\nUnity/African Union on the Conference on Security,\r\nStability, Development and Cooperation in Africa and\r\nthe anti-personnel mine problem, particularly since, in\r\nthis new crusade or jihad for the progress of our\r\npeople, all resources, particularly human resources,\r\nmust be fully and effectively mobilized.\r\nThat is why, in consonance with what the United\r\nNations is doing, Senegal would recall that all mine\r\naction must be part of this five-fold initiative which is\r\nso familiar: assistance and rehabilitation of victims,\r\nmine awareness and education on risk reduction,\r\nrendering effective areas secured, destruction of\r\nstockpiles and universalization of the campaign\r\nthrough the Ottawa Convention.\r\nOne of the top priorities for the international\r\ncommunity is to provide high-quality assistance to the\r\nmine-disabled through the provision of medical and\r\northopaedic services. In order to help the disabled and\r\ntheir families, we must develop a proactive economic\r\nand social reintegration policy to provide them moral\r\nsupport and to enable them to escape the debilitating\r\nstate of dependency, so that they can become, or\r\nresume being, active and dynamic agents of\r\ndevelopment in their region or their country.\r\nSecondly, education — through the launching of\r\nrobust anti-mine campaigns, for instance — remains\r\ncrucial.\r\nWe should urge States to meet their international\r\nobligations — a point that was made earlier by Libya.\r\nThey should be urged to continue and to redouble their\r\nefforts to finance awareness campaigns, to train local\r\ndeminers and to promote civilian demining and so-\r\ncalled proximity demining, so that the decontamination\r\nof areas can be carried out from the perspective of\r\npromoting development for peoples in distress.\r\nIndividuals living in mine-infested areas should\r\nbe provided with extensive information about the\r\ndangers posed by mines and consequently should adapt\r\ntheir behaviour to the new requirements of their area.\r\nThis can be accomplished through the implementation\r\nof educational programmes on the prevention of mine\r\naccidents.\r\nEqually important is the third aspect of mine\r\naction, in which priority is given to mine clearance and\r\nto making mine-infested environments more secure in\r\ncountries emerging from conflict. This requires the full\r\nparticipation of donors and of beneficiaries. Let me cite\r\nas examples, in the region of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau\r\nand Liberia, which require special attention and\r\nassistance from the international community.\r\nTogether with the promoters of international\r\ncampaigns to achieve a mine-free planet, Senegal\r\nendorses the following priorities: the integration by\r\ndevelopment partners of the scourge of “mine\r\npollution” in their aid and cooperation policies; and the\r\ncreation of a permanent fund for mine clearance,\r\nsupported by mandatory contributions and aimed at\r\nfinancing community programmes.\r\nFourthly, there is a clear decline in the\r\ninternational production, sale and transfer of anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, so the priorities here must\r\ninclude, now more than ever before, the systematic\r\ndestruction of stockpiles as well as the mapping and\r\nmarking of minefields, in keeping with new norms of\r\ninternational law emanating from the United Nations.\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nGiven the fact that the number of stockpiled\r\nmines far exceeds the number of those actually laid, the\r\nUnited Nations is encouraged to step up its efforts to\r\nassist targeted countries by providing more effective\r\nmanagement of stockpile-destruction programmes,\r\nwhich should be completed within the four years\r\nfollowing the entry into force of the Convention — that\r\nis to say, in principle, before the deadline of 1 March\r\n2003, which, unfortunately, appears to be nearly\r\nimpossible to meet.\r\nLast but not least, the fifth aspect of mine action\r\ninvolves the need to meet the primary challenge of the\r\nuniversalization of a ban, through the Ottawa process,\r\nthat sets a new international standard against the use of\r\nmines. This legal norm should be adopted by all States,\r\nincluding those that have not yet acceded to the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction.\r\nThat Convention, which was signed on 3\r\nDecember 1997 in Ottawa by some 144 States, entered\r\ninto force on 1 March 1999 following ratification by\r\nBurkina Faso. Today it has been ratified by about 130\r\ncountries and has become a kind of reference point that\r\nshould gradually be adopted by all States that are\r\ndetermined to abide by this new international standard,\r\nwhich is not an exhaustive one but does set an\r\nexample. It is not sufficient, but it is important for\r\nmore than one reason.\r\nBecause States parties are obliged to adopt\r\nnational legislation and to submit period reports, the\r\ncredibility of this legal instrument depends on the\r\npolitical will of States to comply without delay with\r\nthe required confidence-building, transparency and\r\ncontrol measures, which will require increased\r\ntechnical and financial assistance on the part of the\r\ndonors.\r\nHere we would stress the importance of the\r\nUnited Nations Mine Action Strategy for 2001-2005,\r\nwhich we believe should be viewed in the context of a\r\nlarger strategy for peace-building and for the\r\nreconstruction of the social and economic\r\ninfrastructures of the affected countries.\r\nSenegal solemnly appeals to the international\r\ncommunity to provide the necessary financial and\r\ntechnical assistance to the affected countries, in order\r\nto help them develop their national capacities to\r\nrespond to the requirements of mine victims in terms of\r\ncare, rehabilitation and socio-economic reintegration.\r\nWe encourage the World Health Organization, in\r\ncooperation with the relevant organizations, to fine-\r\ntune its intervention strategy in the affected areas and\r\nto propose that specific measures be mainstreamed into\r\npublic-health policies not only for mine victims but for\r\nall communities living in areas affected by this deadly\r\nscourge.\r\nSenegal welcomes the commitment made by\r\nCanada and the European Union to pool their efforts to\r\nincrease global resources for demining activities, to set\r\nup an information centre on mine-clearance\r\ntechnologies and to create a global network to promote\r\nand make available mine-clearance technologies,\r\nparticularly for African countries and their subregional\r\norganizations, at affordable prices.\r\nThat is why the momentum created by the Ottawa\r\nprocess must be maintained, strengthened and\r\nincreased, because that process identified the clear link\r\nbetween the socio-economic, health and development\r\naspects of mine action. This new standard must now\r\nstigmatize the significant number of States that take\r\nrefuge behind contrived arguments to mask their\r\nreluctance to give up military and commercial practices\r\nthat today have become totally unacceptable.\r\nSpeaking about recalcitrant States, Nobel Prize\r\nwinner Jody Williams rightly stated with indignation:\r\n“It is time to put words into action. The\r\ncivilian victims of landmines are tired of being\r\ntold excuses. They are tired of being told that this\r\nnation has unique circumstances, that that nation\r\nhas special security requirements. They are tired\r\nof being told that they must wait until this nation\r\ndevelops alternatives, or wait until that nation’s\r\nneighbour has joined the ban. These are excuses,\r\nnot justifications, and the excuses are costing\r\nlives and limbs every day.”\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to share Senegal’s\r\nvision of a world free from mines as a result of joint\r\naction, led and coordinated by the United Nations,\r\namong populations, States, development partners and\r\nthe family of intergovernmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations, chief among them the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross, the International\r\nCampaign to Ban Landmines and Handicap\r\nInternational.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nThere is a wise old saying in my country that man\r\nis the remedy for man. Let us ardently hope that, in\r\nregions that are still ravaged and torn apart by mines,\r\nwe will soon see a new day dawn — a joyful day in\r\nwhich all can work together with determination and in\r\nharmony and peace for the full development of the\r\ngreat human brotherhood.\r\nMs. Costa (United States of America): The\r\nUnited States is a strong supporter of humanitarian\r\nmine action. We were among the sponsors of last year’s\r\nresolution on assistance in mine action and look\r\nforward to negotiating this year’s draft resolution with\r\na view to sponsorship once again.\r\nSince 1993, the United States has dedicated over\r\n$600 million to humanitarian mine action and will\r\nprovide approximately $100 million more in 2003 to 43\r\ncountries. We are pleased that concerted effort by\r\nmine-affected countries, as well as donor Governments,\r\ninternational organizations, non-governmental\r\norganizations and civil society, has resulted in\r\nsignificant progress towards a mine-safe world.\r\nSince 1988, when the United States first engaged\r\nin humanitarian demining in Afghanistan, we have\r\nexpanded our humanitarian mine-action assistance to\r\nmore than 40 countries. We are helping to demine the\r\nmost dangerous minefields, train humanitarian\r\ndeminers and provide medical assistance and\r\nvocational training to survivors of landmine incidents\r\nand their families. We are teaching children and their\r\nparents to identify and avoid the threat of landmines,\r\nand we are also conducting research and development\r\ninto new technologies to detect and clear landmines\r\nmore safely, quickly and efficiently.\r\nThe Leahy War Victims Fund of the Agency for\r\nInternational Development, together with the United\r\nStates Department of Education and the Centers for\r\nDisease Control, are providing vocational,\r\npsychological and medical assistance, including\r\nprosthetic devices, for survivors of landmine accidents\r\nin a dozen countries. The Department of Defense\r\nperforms research to identify new techniques for mine\r\ndetection and clearance. Taken together with other\r\ndonor Governments, these efforts have resulted in\r\nsignificant successes over the years.\r\nThe United States believes that we can most\r\neffectively help mine-affected countries by supporting\r\nsustainable, indigenous programmes. Thus we have\r\nestablished most of our programmes on a bilateral\r\nbasis. We recognize the important role the United\r\nNations system plays, however, in meeting this\r\ninternational challenge. We are proud of our work with\r\nthe United Nations system to help achieve those results\r\nand we salute the leadership of the United Nations\r\nMine Action Service, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the\r\nUnited Nations Office for Project Services and the\r\nWorld Health Organization in their vital contributions\r\nto a mine-safe world. We are also helping to strengthen\r\nmine-action centres abroad.\r\nIn order to accelerate the elimination of persistent\r\nlandmines and to provide assistance to survivors of\r\nlandmine accidents, the United States has forged more\r\nthan 30 public-private partnerships to augment\r\nGovernment resources. Partnerships have added a\r\ndynamic element to mine action, and we have\r\ncontributed our resources in a way that leverages\r\nprivate donor contributions. The Adopt-A-Minefield\r\nprogramme of the United Nations Association of the\r\nUnited States of America, for example, works with the\r\nUnited Nations and the United Nations Foundation to\r\nhelp demine Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nCambodia, Croatia, Mozambique and Viet Nam. To\r\ndate, over $5 million has been raised and 100\r\nminefields demined. Adopt-A-Minefield programmes\r\nhave also been created in the United Kingdom, Canada\r\nand Sweden.\r\nThe United States is active in the Convention on\r\nCertain Conventional Weapons, being a strong\r\nsupporter of the Amended Protocol on mines and a\r\nproponent of expanding the scope of that Protocol to\r\ninclude anti-vehicle, as well as anti-personnel mines.\r\nThe United States has destroyed more than 3.3 million\r\nof its own landmines and has had a transfer ban in\r\nplace since 1993.\r\nWe are proud of these efforts and the progress\r\nthat has resulted when Governments, international\r\nagencies and private groups work together towards a\r\nmine-safe world. The United States is committed to\r\nsupporting public and private efforts for mine action\r\nand is grateful for the increased cooperation that has\r\nemerged over the past decade in tackling this\r\ntremendous problem. We owe our fellow human beings\r\nnothing less than the right to walk the earth in safety.\r\nMs. Saiga (Japan): It is important for us to work\r\ntogether to create a world free from the threat of\r\nlandmines, and the Government of Japan has been\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nadvocating a “zero-victim” initiative to this end. In\r\npursuing our common goal in this area, Japan regards it\r\nas essential that a comprehensive approach be\r\nestablished, based on the two main strategies of\r\nrealizing a universal and effective ban on landmines on\r\nthe one hand and strengthening assistance in mine\r\naction, including mine clearance, mine awareness and\r\nvictim assistance, on the other.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to refer to\r\nsome of the efforts the Government of Japan has been\r\nmaking in the field of mine action.\r\nIn order to achieve the common goal of zero\r\nvictims, the Government of Japan pledged a financial\r\ncontribution of 10 billion yen — approximately $90\r\nmillion — for the five-year period beginning in 1998.\r\nBy October this year, two months short of that five-\r\nyear period, Japan had fulfilled its pledge and actually\r\ngone somewhat beyond the target figure. So far, it has\r\nprovided assistance to 25 affected countries and\r\nareas — among them Cambodia, Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Angola, Mozambique and Nicaragua —\r\nto support their mine-action activities, which have\r\ninvolved mine clearance, victim assistance and mine-\r\nawareness education. And it has contributed\r\napproximately $17 million to the United Nations Trust\r\nFund for Assistance in Mine Action, managed by the\r\nUnited Nations Mine Action Service. The forms that\r\nJapanese assistance has taken include providing mine-\r\nclearance equipment, dispatching experts to mine-\r\naffected countries and supporting the landmine-related\r\nwork of non-governmental organizations through\r\ngrants.\r\nHere, let me focus on the assistance recently\r\nprovided by Japan in Afghanistan as an example of our\r\nefforts. In January 2002, in the hope of helping to\r\nalleviate the plight of refugees and displaced persons in\r\nthat country, the Government of Japan donated $19.2\r\nmillion to United Nations organizations and other\r\nbodies for mine-action activities. In October this year,\r\nJapan decided to extend another grant of $4.8 million\r\nto the United Nations Development Programme, the\r\nMine Action Centre for Afghanistan and the United\r\nNations Office for Project Services for their mine-\r\naction projects in Afghanistan. It goes without saying\r\nthat Japan spares no effort in victim assistance,\r\nincluding providing artificial limbs for landmine\r\nvictims and supporting them through the process of\r\nrehabilitation and socio-economic reintegration. The\r\nGovernment of Japan sincerely hopes that these\r\ncontributions will facilitate the long-term stability and\r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan.\r\nWhile much has been achieved in the activities of\r\nthe international community in the area of mine action,\r\nthere are still a very large number of mines remaining\r\nand the total number of mine victims continues to\r\nincrease. The Government of Japan is of the view that\r\nmine-action activities should be conducted as\r\neffectively and efficiently as possible to expedite the\r\nsolution of this problem. For this purpose, it is\r\ndesirable to take a systematic approach. It would be\r\nuseful if the United Nations mine action-related\r\nagencies could develop a standardized system to\r\nmonitor the progress of mine-action programmes and a\r\nmechanism to gather and disseminate information on\r\nlessons learned by mine-affected countries.\r\nJapan also considers coordinated and concerted\r\nefforts by the international community to be very\r\nimportant. In this connection, Japan has recently been\r\nappointed to be co-Rapporteur, with Cambodia, of the\r\nStanding Committee on Mine Clearance, Mine\r\nAwareness and Mine Action Technologies in the\r\nIntersessional Work Programme of the Ottawa\r\nConvention. We hope to facilitate the discussion in this\r\nfield and to further promote international cooperation\r\nin mine action.\r\nIn conclusion, the Government of Japan reaffirms\r\nits determination to work hard towards the solution of\r\nlandmine problems in the hope that one day we will\r\nreally achieve our goal of zero victims and that the\r\npeople of the world will talk about landmines and the\r\ntragedies they caused as things of the past.\r\nMr. Hynes (Canada): 3 December will mark five\r\nyears since the Ottawa Convention was opened for\r\nsignature. In that time, great strides have been made in\r\naddressing the humanitarian challenges presented by\r\nthe global landmines crisis. Vast tracts of mined land\r\nhave been cleared; significant resources have been\r\nmobilized for assistance to victims; stockpiles of anti-\r\npersonnel mines have been destroyed at impressive\r\nrates; transfers of these weapons have virtually ceased;\r\nand there has been a significant drop in global\r\nproduction and use of anti-personnel mines.\r\nBut more — much more — remains to be done.\r\nDemining efforts continue in more than 70 countries,\r\nwith many others in need of similar programmes. More\r\nthan 200 million mines remain in the stockpiles of\r\nmore than 90 countries. This year, as we have heard\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nthis morning, two United Nations Member States have\r\nengaged in large-scale mine-laying operations, while\r\nsome others continued to use mines in smaller\r\ndeployments. Fourteen States are still officially\r\nproducers of these weapons. Against this background,\r\nvictims of landmines numbered 15,000 to 20,000 last\r\nyear.\r\nSo the urgent humanitarian imperative remains,\r\nas does the political imperative of securing ever-\r\nincreasing and ultimately universal acceptance of the\r\nnorms of the Ottawa Convention.\r\nThe United Nations has been an essential partner\r\nin the work undertaken to date and it has a crucial,\r\ncentral role in facing the challenges ahead. Last year at\r\nthis time, the Assembly considered and endorsed a\r\nstrategy that provided a comprehensive, detailed road\r\nmap for setting directions and gauging progress in\r\nmine-action activities of the United Nations system\r\nover a five-year period. The report before us today\r\ndocuments an impressive record of achievement in the\r\nfirst year of implementing that plan. Of the 42 specific\r\nobjectives contained in that strategy, fully 15 were\r\ntargeted for completion in 2002. All of these have\r\neither been or are well on the way to being attained.\r\nCanada extends its appreciation and congratulations to\r\nthe United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund and all other partner agencies\r\nfor the leadership and effectiveness they have\r\ndemonstrated in mounting mine-action programmes in\r\nseveral complex emergencies, addressing mine-risk\r\neducation and victim assistance needs and in assisting\r\nGovernments and civil society to establish the requisite\r\ncapacities to fulfil such tasks over the long term.\r\nWe have been particularly impressed with the\r\nefforts made by UNMAS and all relevant United\r\nNations agencies to improve coordination and\r\nteamwork among themselves and with their\r\ngovernmental and non-governmental partners. We\r\nstrongly encourage continued attention to this task.\r\nWith significantly increased operational demands\r\narising in such countries as Afghanistan and Angola, it\r\nis painfully evident that the humanitarian and\r\ndevelopment aims of mine action can be realized only\r\nif the international community pulls effectively\r\ntogether. Next year’s review of the five-year strategy\r\noffers an important opportunity for further\r\nstrengthening the coherence and the impact of our\r\ncollective efforts.\r\nContinued efforts are required in all regions, but I\r\nwould like today to briefly mention the challenge in the\r\nmost mine-affected continent of all — Africa. The\r\nsecurity and development needs of Africa were a\r\nparticular focus of this year’s G8 summit in\r\nKananaskis, Canada. At that meeting, G8 leaders\r\nconferred with African leaders and adopted a\r\ncomprehensive plan of action for enhanced\r\npartnerships to promote stability and sustained\r\ndevelopment on the African continent. The Africa\r\nAction Plan included a specific commitment to assist\r\nAfrican countries in eliminating and removing\r\nlandmines, and we have now embarked on a process of\r\nconsultations with G8 partners with a view to making\r\ngood on that commitment. This process will include\r\nconsultations with African partners, other major donors\r\nand international institutions, including the United\r\nNations.\r\nOne key to ensuring progress — and this is a\r\nfactor that has been mentioned this morning and\r\napplies in all regions — will be for the concerned\r\nAfrican countries themselves to recognize and\r\ncommunicate clearly the crucial role that mine action\r\nmust play as a priority in their overall development\r\nplans. They must also recognize that, beyond the\r\nindividual human tragedy wrought by these\r\nindiscriminate weapons, their use and their presence in\r\nmany situations presents a major obstacle to post-\r\nconflict recovery, peace and long-term development.\r\nFinally, and in the same vein, Canada believes\r\nthat it is crucial for the United Nations and its Member\r\nStates to acknowledge the critical role that mine action\r\nhas to play in advancing the Organization’s broader\r\npurposes of peace, security and development in many\r\nparts of the world. One way in which that reality can be\r\ngiven concrete recognition is through the dedication of\r\na more appropriate share of regular budget resources to\r\ncore mine-action operations, such as those of the\r\nUnited Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), in\r\norder to reduce the undue reliance of essential\r\noverhead operations on voluntary funding.\r\nClearly, the international donor community bears\r\nand will continue to bear a major share of the\r\nresponsibility for meeting the humanitarian and\r\ndevelopmental challenges presented by anti-personnel\r\nmines. But that responsibility can be effectively\r\ndischarged only in true partnership with mine-affected\r\nGovernments, with relevant international institutions\r\nand with non-governmental actors. In closing, I should\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nlike to reaffirm that Canada remains committed to full\r\nand active participation in this crucial undertaking.\r\nMr. Kirn (Slovenia): Slovenia associates itself\r\nwith the statement made earlier by the representative of\r\nDenmark on behalf of the European Union. In addition,\r\nI should like to add a few points on behalf of my\r\nGovernment.\r\nFirst of all, I should like to join previous speakers\r\nin commending the Secretary-General for his report on\r\nassistance in mine action (A/57/430). The report duly\r\nreflects the strategic goals and objectives in that area as\r\nwell as the current situation on the ground with regard\r\nto their implementation. The mine-action strategy of\r\nthe United Nations should remain transparent,\r\nstraightforward and unsophisticated in order to match\r\nthe very unsophisticated nature of the anti-personnel\r\nlandmines that the strategy is essentially aimed at\r\ncombating.\r\nNext month, it will have been five years since the\r\nOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production, and Transfer of Anti-\r\npersonnel Mines and on Their Destruction (Mine Ban\r\nConvention) was adopted. States parties to that\r\nConvention have assumed obligations to destroy\r\nlandmine stocks, to clear mine areas and to provide\r\nresources for mine awareness and victim assistance\r\nprogrammes. In addition to full implementation of\r\nthose commitments, we must call for universalization\r\nof the Mine Ban Convention. Our deliberations today\r\nshould echo and uphold the message contained in the\r\nmine-action strategy of the United Nations: a call for\r\nrenewed political commitment to sustained mine action\r\nworldwide. Sustained efforts are needed, both on the\r\npart of States parties to the Ottawa Convention, to meet\r\ntheir obligations, and on the part of the international\r\ncommunity, to ensure continued assistance, particularly\r\nto mine-affected countries, in meeting their obligations\r\nand commitments. Those efforts for global mine action\r\nmay well be threatened if they are not supported by\r\nmuch-needed renewed and unequivocal political\r\ncommitment, particularly to surmount donor fatigue\r\nwith regard to mine clearance.\r\nAs stated in the report of the Secretary-General,\r\nimportant lessons in mine action can be learned where\r\nprogress can be measured against clear objectives.\r\nSlovenia fully subscribes to that statement. By\r\nestablishing the International Trust Fund for Demining\r\nand Mine Victims Assistance (ITF) four years ago,\r\nSlovenia set out clear objectives in the field of mine\r\naction: to remove the red dots — representing mine\r\nfields — on the map in the region of South-Eastern\r\nEurope and to assist mine victims. To date, 31.4\r\nmillion square meters have been demined in South-\r\nEastern Europe and close to 700 mine victims have\r\nbeen rehabilitated. Apart from its efficiency and\r\ntransparency, among the ITF’s most visible\r\nachievements are a low overhead cost of 3 per cent and\r\na low demining cost per square metre of $1.70. That is\r\nwhy the ITF has also been successful in defying donor\r\nfatigue: it has succeeded in raising $102 million in four\r\nyears. United States donations have made up half of\r\nthat amount, and the European Union has also been an\r\nimportant donor, along with 24 other donor countries.\r\nAfter its early success in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the ITF embraced a broader regional role\r\nin South-Eastern Europe that also encourages regional\r\ncooperation, which is of the utmost humanitarian\r\nimportance and of political significance in the process\r\nof post-conflict rehabilitation. Thus, the ITF became a\r\nfocal point of the South-Eastern Europe Mine Action\r\nCoordination Council, which also meets the objectives\r\noutlined in the mine-action strategy of the United\r\nNations. That strategy, inter alia, highlights the\r\nimportance of lessons learned in mine action. Slovenia\r\nbelieves that our future assistance and support with\r\nrespect to mine action should also stem from lessons\r\nlearned in implementing national and regional\r\napproaches. That is why the Slovenia-based ITF has\r\nalso offered its expertise to countries in need outside\r\nthe South-Eastern European region — namely, in the\r\nCaucasus.\r\nIn order to ensure sustainability in mine action, it\r\nwould be worthwhile to provide an opportunity within\r\nthe United Nations framework to share experiences and\r\nlessons learned thus far in the whole spectrum of mine\r\naction. We believe that that opportunity should also be\r\nprovided in the context of the New York-based Mine\r\nAction Support Group, which Slovenia joined recently.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Israel, who wishes to\r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind\r\nmembers that, in accordance with General Assembly\r\ndecision 34/401, statements in exercise of the right of\r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention\r\nand to five minutes for the second, and should be made\r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): I am taking the floor\r\ntoday in order to briefly clarify certain inaccuracies in\r\nthe statement made today by the representative of\r\nLebanon.\r\nOn 24 May 2000, Israeli forces completely\r\nwithdrew from southern Lebanon, in full and\r\nconfirmed compliance with United Nations Security\r\nCouncil resolution 425 (1978). Five days later, on 29\r\nMay, Israel Defence Forces liaison officers held a\r\nseries of meetings with the senior command of the\r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)\r\nand transferred detailed maps previously used by the\r\nIsrael Defence Forces indicating the location in\r\nsouthern Lebanon of mine fields and areas suspected of\r\ncontaining mines and other explosive devices. That\r\nalso included all information regarding mines or other\r\nexplosive devices planted by other elements operating\r\nin the area. Upon receiving the Israeli maps and files,\r\nUNIFIL’s senior command signed official\r\nconfirmations of the transfer of that information.\r\nAs is widely known, southern Lebanon has served\r\nas a breeding ground for terrorist activities for many\r\nyears in violation of international law, including\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Throughout\r\nthis period, large quantities of mines, booby traps and\r\nother devices have been laid by terrorist groups and by\r\nindividual terrorists. Those mines and explosive\r\ndevices have never been marked, mapped or reported,\r\nnor have the areas been fenced off in order to avoid\r\ncivilian casualties. Today, those mines and booby traps\r\ncontinue to pose a serious threat to the population of\r\nsouthern Lebanon.\r\nPursuant to Security Council resolution 425\r\n(1978), and in accordance with international law, it is\r\nthe responsibility of the Government of Lebanon to\r\nestablish effective control and authority in the area and\r\nrestore international peace and security to southern\r\nLebanon. Clearly, the failure to fulfil these\r\nresponsibilities, with respect, inter alia, to minefields,\r\nendangers the civilian population in that area.\r\nIsrael remains willing to assist should any further\r\nclarifications be required with regard to the\r\ninformation it has transferred. Indeed, Israel’s\r\nwillingness to cooperate in mine clearance has already\r\nbeen demonstrated elsewhere in the world. During the\r\nyears 1995 to 2001, Israel, in conjunction with the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund, conducted a mine\r\nawareness project in Angola that aimed to educate the\r\nlocal population as to the hazards of mines.\r\nAdditionally, Israel conducted a joint mine clearance\r\nproject with Jordan in the Aravah Valley in order to\r\nenable the agricultural utilization of that area.\r\nSimilarly, Israel, Jordan, Canada and Norway joined in\r\na project aimed at Jordan Valley mine clearance and\r\nmedical rehabilitation for Jordanian mine victims.\r\nWhere there is goodwill and a willingness to\r\ncooperate, much good can be accomplished in the area\r\nof mine clearance. However, when these are absent, the\r\nresult is a perpetuation of the threat to the well being of\r\ninnocent civilians.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): The\r\nrepresentative of Israel did not want this meeting to\r\nconclude without making more mischaracterizations.\r\nHe said that I made inaccurate allegations in my\r\nstatement. Mr. President, allow me to respond to the\r\nrepresentative of Israel.\r\nHe has just raised a number of issues that I did\r\nnot mention in my statement. In the discipline of logic,\r\nthis is known as “anticipation”. Instead of addressing\r\nthe core issue, the representative of Israel jumped to\r\nother issues, thus creating a distraction from the main\r\nsubject.\r\nRegarding resolution 425 (1978) and the\r\nwithdrawal from southern Lebanon, we describe Israel\r\nas “the lazy student” who fails in his academic\r\nperformance and whose marks range between zero and\r\none on a scale of twenty. He then might achieve a three\r\nout of twenty and claim as a result that he has scored a\r\nhigh mark. The level of the mark is relative to his\r\nprevious performance.\r\nIsrael’s withdrawal from Lebanon is not adequate.\r\nIsrael has to fulfil many other decisions and to\r\nwithdraw from the remaining areas of southern\r\nLebanon. I will not go into more detail on this, but I\r\nneed to respond briefly to the remarks made by the\r\nIsraeli representative regarding mine action.\r\nHe said that Israeli Defence Forces liaison officers met\r\non 29 May with the senior command of the United\r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and that\r\nthey handed to them “all information regarding mines”.\r\nThat is precisely what the Israeli representative said. I\r\nwill not answer him in my own words. Instead, I will\r\nquote the Secretary-General, who said in paragraph 16\r\nof his report, document S/2002/746, issued on 12 July\r\n2002: “On 30 April, Israel handed over to UNIFIL\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.51\r\nsupplementary data on minefields in south Lebanon”. I\r\nhave just read the Secretary-General’s words verbatim.\r\nMr. President, on 30 April 2002, Israel submitted\r\ninformation on “some” mines in southern Lebanon, not\r\n“all information regarding mines”. The Israeli\r\nrepresentative claims that, on 29 May, Israel\r\ntransferred all information regarding landmines. In\r\nplain language, this is untruthful. This is imprecise\r\nlanguage. I wish that the Israeli representative had\r\nchecked and verified his facts before taking the floor.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Israel who wishes to speak\r\na second time in exercise of the right of reply. Such\r\nstatements should be limited to five minutes and be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): I am bewildered by the\r\nsecond Lebanese statement.\r\nTwo and a half years ago, a radical change\r\noccurred on the Israeli-Lebanese border. As I have\r\nalready mentioned, Israel has withdrawn from\r\nLebanon, fulfilling its responsibilities under resolution\r\n425 (1978).\r\nThe Secretary-General confirmed this withdrawal\r\nin his report to the Security Council. The Security\r\nCouncil endorsed this report, and Security Council\r\nresolution 1310 (2000) was based on this new reality.\r\nWhy then does the representative of Lebanon\r\ncontinue to express his anger and frustration over the\r\noccupation of his country and the violation of its\r\nsovereignty as if nothing had happened? Could it be\r\nthat these Lebanese sentiments have very little to do\r\nwith Israel or its actions?\r\nIsrael has never harboured any aspirations\r\ntowards Lebanese territory or its resources and has\r\nalways taken action with the sole purpose of\r\nmaintaining security along its northern border and\r\nproviding for its own defence. Perhaps these Lebanese\r\nfeelings could be explained by the fact that there is\r\nanother State neighbouring Lebanon that occupies its\r\nsoil and violates its sovereignty.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Lebanon who wishes to\r\nspeak a second time in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMay I remind delegates that this second reply is limited\r\nto five minutes.\r\nMr. Assaf (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): As I\r\nindicated in my first intervention, this is not the subject\r\nunder discussion. We did not say anything to prompt\r\nthis Israeli reaction, because he has no sense of shame.\r\nI have just stated that he is lying. I have corroborated\r\nthat by citing the Secretary-General’s report. He stated\r\nfalsehoods. Why did he not respond to my remarks? I\r\nraised those points, and he said that Israel had\r\nsubmitted “all” maps, while I stated that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral himself admitted that Israel had not submitted\r\nall maps. Why did he not respond to that point? Why\r\ndid he speak of other issues that are not under\r\ndiscussion at this meeting? As I have said, in the\r\ndiscipline of logic, that is known as “anticipation” —\r\njumping ahead. His arguments are weak. He feels no\r\nshame about not stating the truth. The Israeli\r\nrepresentative lacks decency. He should have remained\r\nsilent.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe President in the Chair.\r\nThe President: I would like to inform members\r\nthat document A/INF/57/3/Rev.2 containing a revised\r\nprogramme of work and schedule of meetings for the\r\nmain part of the fifty-seventh session was issued this\r\nmorning.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
