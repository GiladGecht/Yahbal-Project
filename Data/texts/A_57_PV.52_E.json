(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Santa Clara\r\nGomes (Portugal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nReports of the Sixth Committee\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill consider the reports of the Sixth Committee on\r\nagenda items 152 to 166 and 22 (h).\r\nI request the Rapporteur of the Sixth Committee,\r\nMr. Karim Medrek of Morocco, to introduce in one\r\nintervention the reports of the Sixth Committee before\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Medrek (Morocco), Rapporteur of the Sixth\r\nCommittee, (spoke in French): I have the honour today\r\nof introducing to the General Assembly the reports of\r\nthe Sixth Committee on the 16 agenda items allocated\r\nto it: items 152 to 166 and sub-item 22 (h).\r\nI call the Assembly’s attention to agenda item\r\n152, entitled “Status of the Protocols Additional to the\r\nGeneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the\r\nprotection of victims of armed conflicts”. The relevant\r\nreport of the Sixth Committee on this item is contained\r\nin document A/57/559. The Committee recommends to\r\nthe Assembly for adoption the draft resolution\r\ncontained in paragraph 8 thereof.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would in particular appeal to all\r\nStates parties to the Geneva Conventions that have not\r\nyet done so to consider becoming parties to the\r\nadditional Protocols at the earliest possible date. It\r\ncalls upon all States that are already parties to Protocol\r\nI, or those States not parties, on becoming parties to\r\nProtocol I, to make the declaration provided for under\r\narticle 90 of that Protocol. It also calls upon all States\r\nthat have not yet done so to consider becoming parties\r\nto the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural\r\nProperty in the Event of Armed Conflict and the two\r\nProtocols thereto, and to other relevant treaties on\r\ninternational humanitarian law relating to the\r\nprotection of victims of armed conflict.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly will do\r\nthe same.\r\nI now turn to agenda item 153, entitled\r\n“Consideration of effective measures to enhance the\r\nprotection, security and safety of diplomatic and\r\nconsular missions and representatives”. The relevant\r\nreport of the Sixth Committee is contained in document\r\nA/57/560. The draft resolution that the Committee\r\nrecommends to the General Assembly for adoption is\r\ncontained in paragraph 7 of that report.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nAssembly would, among other things, strongly\r\ncondemn acts of violence against diplomatic and\r\nconsular missions and representatives, as well as\r\nagainst missions, representatives and staff of non-\r\ngovernmental organizations. It would also urge States\r\nto take every necessary measure at the national and\r\ninternational levels to prevent such acts of violence and\r\nto ensure, with the participation of the United Nations\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nas appropriate, that such acts are fully investigated in\r\norder to bring offenders to justice. The Sixth\r\nCommittee adopted that draft resolution without a vote.\r\nThe Assembly may wish to do the same.\r\nI would now like to draw the Assembly’s\r\nattention to agenda item 154, entitled “Convention on\r\njurisdictional immunities of States and their property”.\r\nThe relevant report of the Committee is contained in\r\ndocument A/57/561. The draft resolution that the\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly for\r\nadoption is contained in paragraph 7 of that report.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would decide that the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and\r\nTheir Property, which was established by resolution\r\n55/150, of 12 December 2000, shall be convened from\r\n24 to 28 February 2003 to make a final attempt at\r\nconsolidating areas of agreement and resolving\r\noutstanding issues, with a view to elaborating a\r\ngenerally acceptable instrument based on the draft\r\narticles on jurisdictional immunities of States and their\r\nproperty and on the discussions in the Sixth\r\nCommittee, as well as to recommend a form for the\r\ninstrument. The Assembly would also request the Ad\r\nHoc Committee to report to it on the outcome of its\r\nwork at its fifty-eighth session. The Sixth Committee\r\nadopted that draft resolution without a vote. I hope that\r\nthe Assembly will be in a position to do the same.\r\nI now turn to agenda item 155, entitled “Report of\r\nthe United Nations Commission on International Trade\r\nLaw on the work of its thirty-fifth session”. The\r\nrelevant report of the Sixth Committee on this agenda\r\nitem is contained in document A/57/562. In paragraph\r\n15 of that report, the Committee recommends four draft\r\nresolutions for adoption by the General Assembly.\r\nUnder the terms of the first draft resolution,\r\nentitled “Report of the United Nations Commission on\r\nInternational Trade Law on the work of its thirty-fifth\r\nsession”, the General Assembly would, among other\r\nthings, take note of the report of the Commission on its\r\nthirty-fifth session. It would also reaffirm the\r\nimportance, in particular for developing countries, of\r\nthe work of the Commission concerned with training\r\nand technical assistance in the field of international\r\ntrade law. The Assembly would also appeal to\r\nGovernments, the relevant bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem, organizations, institutions and individuals to\r\nsupport such assistance programmes by the\r\nCommission, in particular by making voluntary\r\ncontributions to the Commission’s Trust Fund for\r\nSymposia, as well as by providing contributions to the\r\ntrust fund established to provide travel assistance for\r\ndeveloping countries that are members of the\r\nCommission. The Assembly would also decide to\r\ncontinue, in the competent Main Committee, its\r\nconsideration of granting travel assistance to the least\r\ndeveloped countries that are members of the\r\nCommission, in order to ensure full participation by all\r\nMember States in the sessions of the Commission and\r\nits working groups.\r\nUnder the terms of the operative paragraphs of\r\nthe second draft resolution, entitled “Model Law on\r\nInternational Commercial Conciliation of the United\r\nNations Commission on International Trade Law”, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would express appreciation to the\r\nCommission for completing and adopting the Model\r\nLaw on International Commercial Conciliation, which\r\nis contained in the annex to the draft resolution, as well\r\nas for preparing the Guide to Enactment and Use of the\r\nModel Law. The Assembly would also request the\r\nSecretary-General to make every effort to ensure that\r\nthe Model Law, together with its Guide, become\r\ngenerally known and available to all. Finally, the\r\nAssembly would recommend that all States give due\r\nconsideration to incorporating the Model Law into their\r\nnational laws.\r\nUnder the terms of the operative part of the third\r\ndraft resolution, entitled “Enhancing coordination in\r\nthe area of international trade law and strengthening\r\nthe secretariat of the United Nations Commission on\r\nInternational Trade Law”, the General Assembly would\r\nemphasize the need for higher priority to be given to\r\nthe work of the Commission. The Assembly would also\r\ntake note of the fifteenth recommendation contained in\r\nthe report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services\r\non the in-depth evaluation of the programme on legal\r\naffairs. It would also request the Secretary-General to\r\nconsider measures to strengthen the secretariat of the\r\nCommission within the bounds of the resources\r\navailable to the Organization, if possible during the\r\ncurrent biennium, and in any case during the 2004-\r\n2005 biennium.\r\nFinally, under the terms of the operative\r\nparagraphs of the fourth draft resolution, entitled\r\n“Enlargement of the membership of the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law”, the General\r\nAssembly would enlarge the membership of the\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nCommission from 36 to 60 States, with the following\r\ndistribution of seats among regional groups: 14 seats to\r\nthe Group of African States, 14 seats to the Group of\r\nAsian States, 8 seats to the Group of Eastern European\r\nStates, 10 seats to the Group of Latin American and\r\nCaribbean States and 14 seats to the Group of Western\r\nEuropean and other States. In increasing the\r\nCommission’s membership, the Assembly would bear\r\nin mind the fact that the Commission is a technical\r\nbody whose composition reflects the specific\r\nrequirements of the subject matter. Therefore, the\r\nregional representation resulting from the increase in\r\nmembership would not be a precedent for the\r\nenlargement of other bodies of the United Nations\r\nsystem. The Assembly would also decide that the 24\r\nadditional members would be elected for a term of six\r\nyears, except as otherwise provided by the draft\r\nresolution. The 24 additional members of the\r\nCommission would be elected during the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, and would take office\r\non the first day of the thirty-seventh session of the\r\nCommission, in 2004.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted those four draft\r\nresolutions without a vote. It is the hope of the\r\nCommittee that the Assembly will do the same.\r\nI now turn to agenda item 156, entitled “Report of\r\nthe International Law Commission on the work of its\r\nfifty-fourth session”. The relevant report of the Sixth\r\nCommittee is contained in document A/57/563. The\r\ndraft resolution recommended to the General Assembly\r\nfor adoption is contained in paragraph 8 of that report.\r\nBy the draft resolution, the General Assembly\r\nwould, inter alia, take note with appreciation of the\r\nreport of the International Law Commission on the\r\nwork of its fifty-fourth session. It would also take note\r\nof the decision of the Commission to proceed with its\r\nwork on the topic “International liability for injurious\r\nconsequences arising out of acts not prohibited by\r\ninternational law”, as requested by the General\r\nAssembly in its resolution 56/82 of 12 December 2001,\r\nand of its decision to include in its programme of work\r\nthe following topics: “Responsibility of international\r\norganizations”, “Shared natural resources” and\r\n“Fragmentation of international law: difficulties arising\r\nfrom the diversification and expansion of international\r\nlaw”.\r\nThe General Assembly would reiterate its\r\ninvitation to Governments to provide information to the\r\nCommission regarding State practice on the topic\r\n“Unilateral acts of States” and to submit the most\r\nrelevant national legislation and decisions of domestic\r\ncourts relevant to diplomatic protection in order to\r\nassist the Commission in its work on these topics. The\r\nGeneral Assembly would also invite the International\r\nLaw Commission to continue taking measures to\r\nenhance its efficiency and productivity and would\r\nencourage the Commission to continue taking cost-\r\nsaving measures at its future sessions. The General\r\nAssembly would further decide that the next session of\r\nthe International Law Commission shall be held at the\r\nUnited Nations Office at Geneva from 5 May to 6 June\r\nand from 7 July to 8 August 2003.\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted without a vote.\r\nIt is hoped that the General Assembly will do likewise.\r\nI now turn to agenda item 157, “Report of the\r\nCommittee on Relations with the Host Country”. The\r\nreport of the Sixth Committee on this item is contained\r\nin document A/57/564 and corrigendum 1. The draft\r\nresolution recommended to the Assembly for adoption\r\nis contained in paragraph 8 of the report.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would, inter alia, endorse\r\nrecommendations and conclusions of the Committee on\r\nRelations with the Host Country. It would also express\r\nthe view that the maintenance of appropriate conditions\r\nfor the normal work of the delegations and the missions\r\naccredited to the United Nations and the observance of\r\ntheir privileges and immunities is an issue of great\r\nimportance, and request the host country to continue to\r\nsolve, through negotiations, problems that might arise,\r\nand to take all measures necessary to prevent any\r\ninterference with the functioning of missions.\r\nMoreover, the Assembly would take note of the\r\nopinion of the Legal Counsel of the United Nations\r\nconcerning the Parking Programme for Diplomatic\r\nVehicles; the positions expressed on this issue at the\r\n213th meeting of the Committee, including requests\r\nfrom most speakers to defer implementation of the\r\nParking Programme; and the host country’s\r\ncommitment to maintaining appropriate conditions for\r\nthe functioning of the delegations and missions\r\naccredited to the United Nations in a manner that is\r\nfair, non-discriminatory, efficient and consistent with\r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Assembly would express its appreciation for\r\nthe efforts made by the host country, and hope that the\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nissues raised at the meetings of the Committee will\r\ncontinue to be resolved in a spirit of cooperation and in\r\naccordance with international law. Moreover, it would\r\nnote that during the reporting period the travel controls\r\npreviously imposed by the host country on staff of\r\ncertain missions and staff members of the Secretariat of\r\ncertain nationalities remained in effect, and request the\r\nhost country to consider removing such travel controls.\r\nThe Assembly would also note that the\r\nCommittee anticipates that the host country will\r\ncontinue to ensure the issuance, in a timely manner, of\r\nentry visas to representatives of Member States, in\r\naccordance with applicable agreements, for the purpose\r\nof their attending official United Nations meetings.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly will be in\r\na position to act likewise.\r\nI now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee\r\nconcerning agenda item 158, “Establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court”. The report is contained\r\nin document A/57/565. The draft resolution\r\nrecommended to the General Assembly is contained in\r\nparagraph 10 of the report.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would, inter alia, call upon all States\r\nthat have signed the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court to consider ratifying it or acceding to it\r\nwithout delay, and to becoming parties to the\r\nAgreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. The Assembly would\r\nalso welcome the important work accomplished by the\r\nPreparatory Commission for the International Criminal\r\nCourt in the completion of its mandate, and the holding\r\nof the first session of the Assembly of States Parties to\r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nIn addition, the Assembly would take note of the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the establishment of\r\nthe International Criminal Court, in particular the\r\nindication that the Assembly of States Parties would,\r\ninter alia, resume its first session from 3 to 7 February\r\nand from 21 to 23 April 2003 and hold its second\r\nsession from 8 to 12 September 2003; and that the\r\nCommittee on Budget and Finance would meet from 4\r\nto 8 August 2003. Furthermore, the General Assembly\r\nwould request the Secretary-General to undertake the\r\npreparations necessary for holding the meetings and to\r\nmake Secretariat services available to those meetings.\r\nThe Assembly would further request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to expand the mandate of the trust fund\r\nestablished pursuant to its resolution 51/207 for\r\nvoluntary contributions towards meeting the costs of\r\nparticipation of the least developed countries in the\r\nwork of the Assembly of States Parties.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote and the Assembly may wish to do\r\nlikewise.\r\nI now draw the Assembly’s attention to agenda\r\nitem 159, “Report of the Special Committee on the\r\nCharter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening\r\nof the Role of the Organization”. The report of the\r\nSixth Committee on this item is contained in document\r\nA/57/566. The Sixth Committee recommends for\r\nadoption by the General Assembly three draft\r\nresolutions, which are contained in paragraph 12 of the\r\nreport.\r\nBy the terms of draft resolution I, entitled\r\n“Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of\r\nthe Organization”, the General Assembly would, inter\r\nalia, request the Special Committee, at its next session\r\nfrom 7 to 17 April 2003, to continue its consideration\r\nof all proposals concerning the question of the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security in all\r\nits aspects in order to strengthen the role of the United\r\nNations. The Special Committee would also be\r\nrequested to continue to consider, on a priority basis,\r\nthe question of the implementation of the provisions of\r\nthe Charter of the United Nations related to assistance\r\nto third States affected by the application of sanctions\r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter by commencing a\r\nsubstantive debate on all of the related reports of the\r\nSecretary-General and the proposals submitted on the\r\nquestion.\r\nBy the provisions of draft resolution II, entitled\r\n“Implementation of the provisions of the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations related to assistance to third States\r\naffected by the application of sanctions”, the General\r\nAssembly would, inter alia, renew its invitation to the\r\nSecurity Council to consider the establishment of\r\nfurther mechanisms or procedures, as appropriate, for\r\nconsultations as early as possible under Article 50 of\r\nthe Charter with third States affected by the application\r\nof sanctions under Chapter VII. Moreover, it would\r\ninvite the Council, its sanctions committees and the\r\nSecretariat to take a number of measures including,\r\ninter alia, to continue to ensure, as appropriate, that\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\npre-assessment and ongoing assessment reports contain\r\nanalyses on the impact of sanctions on third States and\r\non how their negative effects could be mitigated.\r\nFurthermore, the General Assembly would\r\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General containing\r\na summary of the deliberations and main findings of\r\nthe ad hoc expert group meeting in 1998 and would\r\ntake note of the Secretary-General’s most recent report,\r\nand in particular of his views on the deliberations and\r\nmain findings of that meeting.\r\nIn addition, the Assembly would decide to\r\nconsider, within the Sixth Committee or a working\r\ngroup of the Committee, at its fifty-eighth session,\r\nfurther progress in the elaboration of effective\r\nmeasures aimed at the implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the Charter related to assistance to third\r\nStates affected by the application of sanctions.\r\nUnder the provisions of draft resolution III,\r\nentitled, “Prevention and peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes”, the General Assembly would urge States to\r\nmake the most effective use of existing procedures and\r\nmethods for the prevention and settlement of their\r\ndisputes peacefully, in accordance with the Charter of\r\nthe United Nations and would also draw the attention\r\nof States to the important roles played by the Security\r\nCouncil, the General Assembly and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in providing early warning and in working for\r\nthe prevention of disputes and situations which might\r\nthreaten international peace and security.\r\nFurthermore, the Assembly would urge the\r\ncontinued enhancement of the concrete steps taken by\r\nthe Secretariat to build and improve the capacity of the\r\nUnited Nations to respond effectively in matters\r\nrelating to dispute prevention. It would also request the\r\nSecretary-General to take such steps as he deems\r\nnecessary from time to time to encourage States to\r\ndesignate suitably qualified persons for inclusion in the\r\nlists of experts in the various mechanisms for dispute\r\nsettlement.\r\nThe Assembly would also remind States that have\r\nnot yet done so that they may make a declaration under\r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice with regard to its\r\ncompulsory jurisdiction in relation to any other State\r\naccepting the same obligation, and would encourage\r\nthem to consider doing so.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted these three draft\r\nresolutions without a vote and hopes that the Assembly\r\nwill do the same.\r\nI now come to agenda item 160, entitled\r\n“Measures to eliminate international terrorism”. The\r\nreport of the Sixth Committee is contained in document\r\nA/57/567. The draft resolution recommended to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for adoption is set out in paragraph\r\n10 of that report.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nAssembly would, inter alia, strongly condemn all acts,\r\nmethods and practices of terrorism as criminal and\r\nunjustifiable, wherever and by whomsoever committed.\r\nIn addition, the Assembly would urge States that have\r\nnot yet done so to consider, as a matter of priority and\r\nin accordance with Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), becoming parties to the relevant conventions\r\nand protocols.\r\nThe draft resolution would urge States to\r\ncooperate with the Secretary-General and with one\r\nanother, as well as with interested intergovernmental\r\norganizations, with a view to ensuring, where\r\nappropriate within existing mandates, that technical\r\nand other expert advice is provided to those States\r\nrequiring and requesting assistance in becoming parties\r\nto the conventions and protocols previously referred to.\r\nThe Assembly would also welcome the efforts of the\r\nTerrorism Prevention Branch of the Centre for\r\nInternational Crime Prevention in Vienna to enhance,\r\nthrough its mandate, the capabilities of the United\r\nNations in the prevention of terrorism.\r\nFurthermore, the Assembly would decide that the\r\nAd Hoc Committee established pursuant to resolution\r\n51/210 of 17 December 1996 would continue to\r\nelaborate a comprehensive convention on international\r\nterrorism as a matter of urgency, and would continue\r\nits efforts to resolve the outstanding issues relating to\r\nthe elaboration of a draft international convention for\r\nthe suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. The Ad\r\nHoc Committee would also keep on its agenda the\r\nquestion of convening a high-level conference under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations to formulate a joint\r\norganized response of the international community to\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. The\r\nAssembly would further decide that the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee would meet from 31 March to 2 April 2003\r\nand that work would also continue, if necessary, during\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nthe fifty-eighth session of the Assembly within the\r\nframework of a working group of the Sixth Committee.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. It is hoped that the Assembly will do\r\nlikewise.\r\nI now turn to the report of the Sixth Committee\r\non agenda item 161, entitled “Scope of legal protection\r\nunder the Convention on the Safety of United Nations\r\nand Associated Personnel”, contained in document\r\nA/57/568 and Corr.1. The draft resolution that the Sixth\r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly for\r\nadoption is set out in paragraph 10 of the report.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would, inter alia, recommend that\r\nthe Secretary-General continue to seek the inclusion of\r\nkey provisions of the Convention in future, as well as,\r\nif necessary, in existing status-of-forces, status-of-\r\nmission and host country agreements, mindful of the\r\nimportance of the timely conclusion of such\r\nagreements. It would also recommend that the\r\nSecretary-General advise the Security Council or the\r\nGeneral Assembly, as appropriate, where in his\r\nassessment circumstances would support a declaration\r\nof exceptional risk for the purposes of article 1(c)(ii) of\r\nthe Convention.\r\nIn operative paragraph 5, the General Assembly\r\nwould confirm the Secretary-General’s authority to\r\nprovide information, on the request of a State, on\r\nmatters of fact relevant to the application of the\r\nConvention.\r\nIn operative paragraph 6, the General Assembly\r\nwould request the Secretary-General to prepare model\r\nor standardized provisions for incorporation into the\r\nagreements between the United Nations and\r\nhumanitarian non-governmental organizations or\r\nagencies, and if possible to report on progress on this\r\nissue before the next meeting of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee established under resolution 56/89. In the\r\nsame paragraph, the Secretary-General would also be\r\nrequested to make available to Member States the\r\nnames of humanitarian non-governmental organizations\r\nor agencies that have concluded agreements with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAccording to operative paragraph 8, the next\r\nmeeting of the Ad Hoc Committee established under\r\nresolution 56/89 would be held from 24 to 28 March\r\n2003. The Ad Hoc Committee’s mandate, as set out in\r\nthe same paragraph, would be to continue the\r\ndiscussion on measures to enhance the existing\r\nprotective legal regime for United Nations and\r\nassociated personnel. In operative paragraph 9, the Ad\r\nHoc Committee would be requested to submit a report\r\non its work to the General Assembly at the fifty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nFinally, in operative paragraph 10, the General\r\nAssembly would request the Secretary-General to\r\nreport to it at its fifty-eighth session on the measures\r\ntaken to implement the resolution.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote, and I hope that the Assembly will do\r\nlikewise.\r\nI now turn to agenda item 162, entitled,\r\n“International convention against the reproductive\r\ncloning of human beings”. The report of the Sixth\r\nCommittee is contained in document A/57/569. The\r\ndraft decision recommended to the General Assembly\r\nfor adoption is found in paragraph 14 of that report.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft decision, the\r\nAssembly would welcome the reports of the Ad Hoc\r\nCommittee on an International Convention against the\r\nReproductive Cloning of Human Beings, which met in\r\nFebruary and March 2002, as well as of the Working\r\nGroup of the Sixth Committee established pursuant to\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 56/93 of 12 December\r\n2001, which met in September 2002.\r\nFurthermore, the Assembly would decide to\r\nconvene a working group of the Sixth Committee\r\nduring the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nfrom 29 September to 3 October 2003 in order to\r\ncontinue the work undertaken during the present\r\nsession of the Assembly. Finally, as is noted in\r\nparagraph 12 of the report, the Committee, in adopting\r\nthe draft decision, decided not to take action on any\r\nother proposals. Indeed, the Committee adopted the\r\ndraft decision without a vote, and it is hoped that the\r\nAssembly will do so as well.\r\nI now turn to agenda item 163, “Observer status\r\nfor the International Institute for Democracy and\r\nElectoral Assistance in the General Assembly”. The\r\nrelevant report of the Committee is contained in\r\ndocument A/57/570, and the draft decision\r\nrecommended to the General Assembly for adoption is\r\nfound in paragraph 8 thereof.\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nUnder the terms of the draft decision, the General\r\nAssembly would decide to defer its consideration of\r\nand a decision on the request for observer status for the\r\nInternational Institute for Democracy and Electoral\r\nAssistance in the General Assembly to its fifty-eighth\r\nsession.\r\nThe draft decision was adopted by the Sixth\r\nCommittee without a vote, and I hope that the\r\nAssembly will do the same.\r\nI now draw your attention to agenda item 164\r\nentitled, “Observer status for Partners in Population\r\nand Development in the General Assembly”.

The relevant\r\nreport of the Committee is contained in document\r\nA/57/573, and the draft resolution recommended to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for adoption is reproduced in\r\nparagraph 7 thereof.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution, the\r\nGeneral Assembly would decide to invite the\r\nInternational Centre for Migration Policy Development\r\nto participate in the sessions and the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the capacity of observer. It would\r\nalso request the Secretary-General to take the\r\nnecessary action to implement the resolution.\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted by the Sixth\r\nCommittee without a vote, and I hope that the\r\nAssembly will be in a position to do the same.\r\nI now draw your attention to agenda item 22 (h)\r\nentitled, “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union”. The relevant report of\r\nthe Committee is contained in document A/57/574, and\r\nthe draft resolution recommended to the General\r\nAssembly for adoption is reproduced in paragraph 7\r\nthereof.\r\nUnder the terms of the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Observer status for the Inter-Parliamentary Union in\r\nthe General Assembly”, the General Assembly would\r\ndecide to invite the Inter-Parliamentary Union to\r\nparticipate in the sessions and the work of the General\r\nAssembly in the capacity of observer.

Allow me to thank all delegations, and in\r\nparticular those of the regional group to which\r\nMorocco belongs and which gave me this great honour\r\nto represent them. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to thank my other colleagues in the bureau\r\nfor their cooperation and cordiality, as well as the\r\nSecretary of the Committee and his close associates for\r\nthe professionalism and great support that they have\r\nshown me throughout.\r\nThe President: If there is no proposal under rule\r\n66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the\r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of\r\nthe Sixth Committee which are before the Assembly\r\ntoday.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nStatements will, therefore, be limited to\r\nexplanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the Sixth Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered in a\r\nMain Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation\r\nshould, as far as possible, explain its vote only once,\r\nthat is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting,\r\nunless that delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is\r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations that explanations of\r\nvote are limited to ten minutes and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Sixth\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that\r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the Sixth Committee, unless the\r\nSecretariat is notified otherwise in advance.\r\nI should, therefore, hope that we may proceed to\r\nadopt without a vote those recommendations that were\r\nadopted without a vote in the Sixth Committee.\r\nAgenda item 152\r\nStatus of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva\r\nConventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of\r\nvictims of armed conflicts\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/57/559)\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the\r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Sixth Committee\r\nin paragraph 8 of its report (A/57/559).\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted by the Sixth\r\nCommittee without a vote.

May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 57/19).\r\nThe President: Draft resolution IV is entitled\r\n“Enlargement of the membership of the United Nations\r\nCommission on International Trade Law”.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted draft resolution IV\r\nwithout a vote.

We note that subparagraph (b) of the\r\ndecision sets forth the mandate for the next session in\r\nneutral terms. The Working Group will continue the\r\nwork undertaken during this session, which has focused\r\non the scope of a future convention.\r\nThe United States and many other Member States\r\nsupport a total ban on human cloning. We are hopeful\r\nthat future discussions will advance the work on this\r\ntopic and enable us to begin work on a convention to\r\nban all cloning of human embryos. Although the item\r\nhas been re-inscribed on the agenda under its current\r\ntitle, this in no way prejudges the outcome of those\r\ndiscussions, especially since many scientists point out\r\nthat all cloning that creates human embryos is, in\r\neffect, reproductive.\r\nOur focus in these discussions has been and\r\nremains the elaboration of a comprehensive ban on\r\nhuman cloning. We believe that the growing support\r\nfor a total ban signals that a course correction is under\r\nway and that the trend towards a total ban will forge a\r\nclear path towards a convention to prohibit all cloning\r\nof human embryos.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 162?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 163\r\nObserver status for the International Institute for\r\nDemocracy and Electoral Assistance in the General\r\nAssembly\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/57/570)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on the draft decision recommended by the\r\nSixth Committee in paragraph 8 of its report.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft decision\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft decision was adopted (decision 57/513).\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe Assembly to conclude its consideration of agenda\r\nitem 163?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nAgenda item 164\r\nObserver status for Partners in Population and\r\nDevelopment in the General Assembly\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/57/571)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on the draft resolution recommended by the\r\nSixth Committee in paragraph 7 of its report.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote.

May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do likewise?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 57/30).\r\nThe President: In accordance with the resolution\r\njust adopted, I now give the floor to the observer for\r\nthe Asian Development Bank.\r\nMr. Sandilya (Asian Development Bank): I\r\nwould like, on behalf of the President of the Asian\r\nDevelopment Bank, Mr. Tadao Chino, to thank the\r\nGeneral Assembly for adopting the resolution inviting\r\nour Bank to participate in the sessions and work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in the capacity of observer.\r\nWe would also like to thank the representative of\r\nChina for sponsoring the draft resolution, as well as the\r\ndelegations that sponsored it and the members of the\r\nSixth Committee, which recommended its adoption.\r\nThe purpose of the Asian Development Bank is to\r\nfoster economic growth, development and regional\r\ncooperation in the Asian and Pacific region. Our\r\noverarching objective is to reduce poverty in our\r\ndeveloping member countries. In so doing, we are\r\ncommitted to helping them in their efforts to achieve\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals that were adopted at\r\nthe Millennium Summit in September 2000. We believe\r\nthat strengthened cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Asian Development Bank will greatly benefit our\r\nendeavours, and we look forward very much to\r\nworking closely with the United Nations family.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly\r\nto conclude its consideration of agenda item 165?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 166\r\nObserver status for the International Centre for\r\nMigration Policy Development in the General\r\nAssembly\r\nReport of the Sixth Committee (A/57/573)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a\r\ndecision on the draft resolution recommended by the\r\nSixth Committee in paragraph 7 of its report.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote.

The draft\r\nresolution is entitled “Observer status for the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union in the General Assembly”.\r\nThe Sixth Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 57/32).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item\r\n(h) of agenda item 22. Also, the Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded its consideration of all the reports of the\r\nSixth Committee before it.\r\nAgenda item 25\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\nDraft resolution (A/57/L.19)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take\r\naction on draft resolution A/57/L.19, entitled “Plenary\r\nmeetings of the General Assembly on 9 and 10\r\nDecember 2002 devoted to the consideration of the\r\nitem entitled `Oceans and the law of the sea’ and to the\r\ncommemoration of the twentieth anniversary of the\r\nopening for signature of the 1982 United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea”.\r\nBefore proceeding to take action on draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.19, I should like to announce that, since\r\nthe publication of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors: Monaco and Nauru.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.19.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.19?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 57/33).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus\r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item 25.\r\nAgenda item 28 (continued)\r\nAssistance in mine action\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/57/430)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the\r\nAssembly began its debate on this agenda item at the\r\n51st plenary meeting, on Friday, 15 November 2002.\r\nMr. Balestra (San Marino): Today, we are\r\naddressing an international humanitarian issue that\r\nwarrants serious concern. At the outset, I should like to\r\nexpress my appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis comprehensive report (A/57/430), which both\r\nrecognizes the progress achieved in current mine-\r\naction assistance and identifies improvements that\r\nshould be made in order to continue to effectively\r\ntackle a current, yet unfortunately old, problem.\r\nOn previous occasions, my delegation has\r\nstrongly stressed the need to provide continuous\r\nassistance to countries crippled by mines, and we have\r\nalways supported the Ottawa Convention, an\r\ninstrument that sets a strong and effective universal\r\nprecedent in condemning the use of mines. Tragically,\r\nin the twenty-first century, generations in many parts of\r\nthe world are being maimed and haunted by past and\r\npresent conflicts as a result of regime tactics of\r\nengaging in warfare through the use of landmines.\r\nPolitical and social instability in various parts of the\r\nworld further contribute to the problem and continue to\r\nvictimize defenceless citizens, many of whom are\r\ninnocent women and children. Landmines are\r\nindiscriminate time bombs; their victims are usually\r\nnot their intended targets, nor do mines detonate only\r\nin times of conflict. Currently, more than 70 countries\r\ncontain 1 million active landmines in unexploded-\r\nordnance sites.\r\nAs stated in the Secretary-General’s report, while\r\nsome goals have been met, new challenges have arisen.\r\nAssistance in mine action is an important and essential\r\ninitiative that necessitates continued support. It is a matter\r\nof humanitarian concern to which my Government is\r\nstrongly committed. San Marino is also aware of the fact\r\nthat landmines will be eradicated, not instantaneously,\r\nbut through long-standing, effective commitment.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nWhile the Ottawa Convention led to a substantial\r\nframework for both banning landmines and assisting\r\ncountries affected by mines and by other unexploded\r\nordnance, the United Nations — through the\r\nengagement of Governments, civil society and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations — must ensure the proper\r\nimplementation of those commitments. San Marino\r\nstrongly believes that, in order to attain concrete results\r\nin the field of implementation, it is necessary to\r\nestablish a road map to evaluate progress achieved in\r\nimplementing the six main objectives identified by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report. My Government is\r\nconvinced that all areas are of equal importance, but\r\nwe should like to welcome, in particular, the progress\r\nachieved in the field of information. The web-based\r\nelectronic mine information network is an essential\r\ninstrument to plan and coordinate mine action activities\r\nand to increase global awareness of the magnitude of\r\nthis terrible problem.\r\nAs the Secretary-General stresses in his report, it\r\nis never too early to start long-term planning in\r\ncountries at risk. Activities related to mine action\r\nshould be integrated into the national development\r\nreconstruction plans of affected nations. The United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies should continue to\r\nplay an active role in providing technical support,\r\nconsolidating their efforts with those of other political\r\nand non-political actors.\r\nDespite the small size and the obvious financial\r\nlimitations of the Government of San Marino, we have\r\nrecognized the importance of landmine assistance in\r\nterms of both political and financial endorsement. Our\r\nmodest support has taken the form of a financial\r\ncontribution for the dissemination of information\r\npackets in communities threatened by this problem.\r\nEducation serves as a means of giving people —\r\nespecially children — who are endangered by landmines a\r\nway to protect themselves from this invisible threat.\r\nAlthough that is a step towards a solution, it is far from a\r\ncomplete answer. We strongly believe that international\r\ncooperation is the only effective way to reduce the\r\ntragic effects of existing landmines and to eradicate\r\nthis terrible scourge in the future.\r\nThe President: Before calling on the next\r\nspeaker, I should like to request that representatives be\r\ngood enough to move quietly through the aisles at the\r\nend of each statement, or even during statements, as\r\nthey enter and leave the General Assembly Hall, so as\r\nnot to disturb the speaker who has the floor. I rely on\r\nthose present to cooperate in maintaining order and\r\nquiet in the Hall, in keeping with the dignity and\r\ndecorum expected of members of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMs. Ognjanovac (Croatia): The Republic of\r\nCroatia has direct experience of the disastrous effects\r\nof mines and, therefore, attaches special importance to\r\nmine action assistance. Croatia believes that the Ottawa\r\nConvention has gone a long way towards bringing the\r\ngoal of a mine-free world just a bit closer to reality. It\r\nhas opened a forum for discussion among States,\r\nforced us to take concrete and legally binding action to\r\ndestroy all anti-personnel mines, and has given us a\r\nplace to exchange information and expertise and, in\r\nsome cases, to provide much-needed assistance.\r\nCroatia actively participates in the work of the\r\nOttawa Convention on anti-personnel mines, including\r\nthrough various formal and informal groups that\r\noperate within the scope of the Convention. At the\r\nFourth Meeting of States Parties, held in September\r\n2002, Croatia, along with Australia, passed on the co-\r\nchairmanship of the Standing Committee on Stockpile\r\nDestruction to Romania and Switzerland and wished\r\nthem every success in the coming year, especially at\r\nthis crucial time when the first deadlines under article 4\r\nof the Convention are about to expire. Croatia also\r\nvoiced its appreciation to States parties for their\r\ndecision to once again appoint it to another two-year\r\nmandate of co-rapporteurship/co-chairmanship, this\r\ntime in the Standing Committee on Victim Assistance\r\nand Socio-Economic Reintegration.\r\nIn regard to Ottawa Convention obligations,\r\nCroatia fulfilled its article-4 obligation to destroy its\r\nstockpiles on 23 October 2002. The seminar on\r\n“Humanitarian mine action: progress under the mine\r\nban treaties”, which took place in Dubrovnik at the end\r\nof October, was partly an article-6 exercise on\r\ninternational cooperation. The seminar was focused not\r\nonly on international aspects such as Ottawa\r\nConvention implementation, including international\r\nand non-governmental organization (NGO) cooperation\r\nalong those lines, but also on issues such as the\r\ndevelopment of new methods and technologies for\r\ndemining, the financing of demining programmes, as\r\nwell as education and awareness-raising.\r\nCroatia is also working steadily on implementing\r\nits national mine action programme. Taking into\r\naccount the admirable work of its deminers in past\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nyears, and following the completion of recent surveys\r\nof suspected mined areas, we can with a fair amount of\r\ncertainty state that there are about 270 square\r\nkilometres of national territory that are known to be\r\nmined, mainly along the former lines of demarcation,\r\nwhile a further substantial number of square kilometres\r\nof national territory are still marked as suspected of\r\nbeing mined.\r\nWe understand the need to have these areas\r\ndemined as soon as possible, which is why substantial\r\nfinancial resources are allocated by the Croatian\r\nGovernment to the programme annually.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the majority — some 86\r\nper cent — of the national mine action programme is\r\nfinanced domestically, we once again take this\r\nopportunity to thank all donor countries for their\r\ngenerous contributions throughout the past year.\r\nIt should also be mentioned that the Croatian\r\nMine Action Centre has been active in helping to\r\ndevelop international mine action standards, mainly in\r\nthe field of general and humanitarian demining\r\nstandards and guidelines.\r\nAt the Second Review Conference of the States\r\nParties to the Convention on Certain Conventional\r\nWeapons (CCW Convention), Croatia fully supported\r\nproposals for extending the scope of the Convention to\r\ninternal conflicts by amending article 1 of the\r\nConvention, as well as supporting the establishment of\r\nan open-ended group of governmental experts, with\r\nseparate coordinators, to discuss ways and means of\r\naddressing the issue of explosive remnants of war and\r\nto further explore the issue of mines other than anti-\r\npersonnel mines.\r\nOn these specific issues, Croatia distributed a\r\nposition paper at the second session of the expert\r\ngroup, held in July 2002. In short, on the issue of\r\nexplosive remnants of war Croatia supports the\r\nprinciple of systematic resolution of this humanitarian\r\nproblem through the establishment of a legally binding\r\ninstrument. Even though more work is certainly needed\r\non issues such as definitions of explosive remnants of\r\nwar, the role of international humanitarian law related\r\nto explosive remnants of war and defining whose\r\nresponsibility it is to warn the civilian population and\r\nto clean up explosive remnants of war following a\r\nconflict, we believe that the time is ripe for us to\r\nproceed with a negotiating mandate on this issue.\r\nClearing explosive remnants of war should be an\r\nindisputable humanitarian obligation; therefore, we\r\nwill support moves towards the earliest possible\r\nconclusion of negotiations on this issue.\r\nWith regard to mines other than anti-personnel\r\nmines, Croatia still holds the position that these do not\r\npresent the same humanitarian problem that anti-\r\npersonnel mines do. They are not deployed in the same\r\nquantities as anti-personnel mines and, because of their\r\nsize and material content, are easier to detect. We\r\nsupport efforts in the framework of the group of\r\nexperts to make all mines other than anti-personnel\r\nmines detectable, as well as to raise the efficiency of\r\nself-deactivation/self-neutralization or self-destruction\r\nfacilities in all mines other than anti-personnel mines,\r\nbe it through a new or an existing legal instrument.\r\nCroatia also took a further step in regulation of\r\nthe use of all types of mines by acceding to amended\r\nProtocol II CCW Convention, on mines, booby traps\r\nand other devices, in early 2002 and will be ready to\r\nsubmit its first report on its national implementation\r\nmeasures in regard to that instrument by the end of\r\n2002. That being said, Croatia naturally considers that,\r\nin the case where the provisions of the Ottawa\r\nConvention and amended Protocol II of the CCW\r\nConvention collide, the more stringent provisions shall\r\napply, which in this case means that the Ottawa\r\nConvention on anti-personnel mines shall take\r\nprecedence.\r\nLastly, in the field of victim assistance, it should\r\nbe mentioned that the South-East European Regional\r\nCentre for Psycho-Social Rehabilitation of Landmine\r\nVictims, which is situated in the Croatian coastal town\r\nof Rovinj, will be operating on a full-time basis by\r\nJune 2003. The Centre, founded by the Government of\r\nCroatia and the Croatian Mine Victim Association, will\r\ncater to the needs of mine victims from the entire\r\nSouth-East European region, across national and\r\npolitical boundaries. While the Centre will be geared to\r\nchildren and young adult victims of mines, it will not\r\nexclude older mine victims, for whom a special\r\nprogramme will be offered at the Centre while schools\r\nare in session and children are unable to come.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in increasing\r\ninternational mine-related activities and cooperation\r\nremains indisputable, and we are looking forward to\r\nthe continuing contribution of the world Organization.\r\nI can assure the Assembly that Croatia will remain\r\nactively engaged in this process.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nMr. Stritt (Switzerland) (spoke in French): In\r\nrecent years, there has been significant progress in\r\ninternational mine action.  However, the world is far\r\nfrom being rid of this scourge, since millions of anti-\r\npersonnel mines remain buried in the ground or in\r\nstockpiles.  Much remains to be done; a world free of\r\nanti-personnel mines can be achieved only through the\r\ncombined efforts of international organizations,\r\nGovernments and civil society, non-governmental\r\norganizations (NGOs), experts and the population\r\ndirectly affected.\r\nSwitzerland recognizes the key role of the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service (UNMAS), especially in\r\nthe fields of policy-making, coordination and\r\nadvocacy. We also appreciate the valuable\r\ncontributions of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP), the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund (UNICEF) and other United Nations agencies in\r\nthe fight against anti-personnel mines.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the comprehensive and\r\ninformative report of the Secretary-General on\r\nassistance in mine action (A/57/430). In our view,\r\nparticular attention should be given to increasing local\r\ncapacity and national ownership in order to guarantee\r\nthe sustainability of mine action. Quality control and\r\ndonor coordination are also crucial. Furthermore, we\r\nwelcome the United Nations Mine Action Strategy for\r\n2001-2005. The six strategic goals are very important\r\nand require the necessary attention and resources.\r\nSwitzerland also welcomes the fact that the\r\nUnited Nations and non-governmental organizations\r\nare encouraging States to ratify and comply with\r\nexisting international instruments on anti-personnel\r\nmines. The Ottawa Convention clearly shows how\r\nmultilateral instruments can make valuable\r\ncontributions not only to reducing the threat of anti-\r\npersonnel mines, but also to strengthening peace\r\nprocesses and international security.\r\nNevertheless, we must not lose sight of the\r\ncomplex issue of non-State actors, which continue to\r\nproduce and use landmines. Progress towards a world\r\nfree of anti-personnel mines would be promoted if non-\r\nState actors renounced the use of those weapons, in\r\nkeeping with the Ottawa Convention. Therefore,\r\nSwitzerland urges all non-State actors to renounce the\r\nuse, stockpiling, production and transfer of all anti-\r\npersonnel mines, in accordance with the principles and\r\nnorms of international humanitarian law.\r\nMine action is one of the priorities of our peace\r\nand security policies, as well as of our human security\r\npolicy. Switzerland, as a member of the Human\r\nSecurity Network, recognizes the common interests\r\nand objectives shared by mine action and activities in\r\nthe broader field of human security. In particular, the\r\nefforts of the Human Security Network should be used\r\nas an additional instrument for strengthening mine\r\naction.\r\nThe Geneva International Centre for\r\nHumanitarian Demining (GICHD), which Switzerland\r\ninitiated and largely finances, provides significant\r\nsupport to the United Nations in the form of research\r\nand operational assistance. Under an UNMAS mandate,\r\nthe Geneva Centre has developed international mine\r\naction standards and operates the Information\r\nManagement System for Mine Action (IMSMA), which\r\nis now in place in nearly 30 countries. The Centre\r\nsupports implementation of the Ottawa Convention\r\nthrough its implementation support unit, which now\r\nplays an irreplaceable role, particularly by serving as\r\nan important communication and liaison focal point for\r\nall interested actors.\r\nIn the field of victim assistance, Switzerland, in\r\ncooperation with the International Committee of the\r\nRed Cross, the World Health Organization, UNICEF\r\nand Handicap International, has developed a strategic\r\nconcept that includes not only mine victims, but all\r\nvictims of violence. Only the integration of victims\r\ninto the wider context of post-conflict reconstruction\r\nand into long-term development cooperation strategies\r\nwill provide effective and sustainable solutions. That\r\ncomprehensive approach is widely recognized and is\r\nused also by UNMAS and UNDP. The next step is to\r\nimplement the strategy at the national and regional\r\nlevels.\r\nIn order to strengthen mine action activities\r\nworldwide, Switzerland provides financial, human and\r\nmaterial resources to United Nations programmes and\r\nto qualified non-governmental organizations. With\r\nregard to demining and the destruction of stockpiles, in\r\n2002, Switzerland has financed projects or engaged\r\nexperts in 15 countries, primarily in the Balkans and\r\nAfrica. In 2003, Switzerland will focus its demining\r\nactivities on Angola and Mozambique, and additional\r\ndeployments of personnel are planned in Sri Lanka and\r\nChad. In order to ensure adequate and sustainable\r\nhuman resources in the future, Switzerland has\r\nestablished a pool of demining specialists for\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\ninternational mission deployment. In addition,\r\nSwitzerland provides equipment, particularly devices\r\nfor the contact-free destruction of unexploded\r\nordnance.\r\nIn June 2002, Switzerland organized for the\r\nsecond time, in cooperation with the Geneva\r\nInternational Centre for Humanitarian Demining, a\r\none-week workshop on the management of national\r\nmine destruction programmes. As Co-Chairman of the\r\nStanding Committee on Stockpile Destruction within\r\nthe context of the Ottawa Convention, Switzerland will\r\ncontinue to play an active role in that field. The first\r\nofficial deadline for more than 10 States parties to\r\ndestroy their stockpiles will expire at the end of March\r\n2003. Switzerland will work closely with the other\r\nStates parties to ensure that that deadline is met and\r\nthat countries experiencing difficulties in meeting their\r\nresponsibilities receive assistance and cooperation.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the role that Geneva plays\r\nin mine action alongside the complementary role\r\nplayed by New York. Geneva was privileged to have\r\nhosted the Fourth Meeting of States Parties to the\r\nOttawa Convention, from 16 to 20 September 2002.\r\nSwitzerland will continue to provide the best possible\r\nworking conditions for the following intersessional and\r\nfuture meetings of States parties, as well as for the\r\nnumerous international and non-governmental\r\norganizations based in Geneva in order to facilitate the\r\ncampaign against anti-personnel mines and their severe\r\nhumanitarian consequences.\r\nMr. Sevilla Somoza (Nicaragua) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the\r\nCentral American countries: Belize, Costa Rica, the\r\nDominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala,\r\nHonduras, Nicaragua and Panama.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate the\r\nSecretary-General on his excellent report on this\r\nsubject, contained in document A/57/430. The progress\r\nmade in the United Nations Mine Action Strategy for\r\n2001-2005 is described in the report. We agree with the\r\nSecretary-General that this first year of implementation\r\nhas shown how useful it has been to have a concrete\r\nplan with clear goals. The plan has also made it\r\npossible to have a more systematic focus on United\r\nNations activities and on achieving greater coherence\r\nin all mine action activities.\r\nThe most disturbing thing about anti-personnel\r\nmines is their indiscriminate and unpredictable impact.\r\nOnce a mine is placed in a location, it remains active\r\nindefinitely, affecting the lives of populations living\r\nnear the minefields, who suffer the consequences of\r\nwars years after they end.\r\nCentral America has been the scene of several\r\nmilitary conflicts that lasted for many decades and that\r\nended at the beginning of the 1990s. During those\r\nwars, one of the preferred weapons often used by\r\nofficial armies and by irregular forces were anti-\r\npersonnel landmines. Those mines were usually\r\nacquired outside the region, although there were also\r\narmed insurgent groups that used homemade explosive\r\ndevices. There were cases in which the minefields were\r\nprecisely mapped, but there were other cases in which\r\nno record of any kind exists. The competent authorities\r\nbecome aware only when mines explode and take their\r\ntoll in victims, often children, women and the elderly.\r\nAnti-personnel mines are usually placed in economic\r\nand military installations, such as telecommunications\r\nsystems, farmland, electric power towers and bridges.\r\nThat legacy of armed conflict continues to\r\nthreaten much of the population of Guatemala, Costa\r\nRica, Honduras and Nicaragua. Many agricultural areas\r\nremain fallow, and the population lives with\r\nuncertainty with regard to restoring their normal lives.\r\nHowever, economic pressure has often forced people to\r\nremain in those areas and to work near the minefields.\r\nThus, the complete elimination of that evil is a task that\r\nwe Central Americans have undertaken as an urgent\r\nneed.\r\nIn an attempt to resolve the situation just\r\ndescribed, in 1991 the Organization of American States\r\ndecided to implement a project, which later became the\r\nMine-clearing Assistance Programme in Central\r\nAmerica (PADCA), with the cooperation of the States\r\nmembers and observers of that organization.\r\nIn an effort to deal with all aspects of the problem\r\nof anti-personnel mines, the OAS eventually expanded\r\nPADCA into the Programme of Integral Action against\r\nAnti-Personnel Mines in Central America, which\r\nincorporated previous mine clearance activities and\r\nserves as a focal point for the organization in all other\r\naspects of mine action. OAS also established a mine\r\nregistry for the hemisphere and decided to set up new\r\nmine clearance programmes in other countries of the\r\nAmericas where this scourge exists and that request\r\nsuch programmes. Moreover, inter-American bodies\r\nhave also cooperated in creating educational\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nprogrammes aimed at prevention, as well as\r\nprogrammes in the areas of physical and psychological\r\nrehabilitation of victims and the socio-economic\r\nrecovery of demined areas in Central America.\r\nThe progress made by PADCA is due largely to\r\nthe invaluable and generous support of OAS member\r\nStates such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada,\r\nColombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru,\r\nthe United States and Venezuela, as well as to the\r\ncontributions of major international donors such as\r\nAustralia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,\r\nNorway, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, the\r\nRussian Federation, Spain, Sweden and the United\r\nKingdom.\r\nAll of our countries are States parties to the\r\nOttawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,\r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel\r\nMines and on Their Destruction, which represents the\r\neffort of the international community to completely\r\nprohibit these treacherous weapons. All of our\r\ncountries have also submitted the related reports and\r\nupdates on the fulfilment of the Convention’s\r\nprovisions, in accordance with article 7. Similarly,\r\nnone of the countries on whose behalf I am speaking\r\nhave produced or imported anti-personnel mines in the\r\ncourse of this year.\r\nI would now like to provide a summary of the\r\ncurrent situation regarding mines in each of the Central\r\nAmerican countries suffering from this evil.\r\nDuring the long internal war in Guatemala,\r\nGovernment forces did not employ anti-personnel\r\nlandmines. That is not the case with the Guatemalan\r\nRevolutionary Union, which made limited us of home-\r\nmade mines and improvised explosive devices during\r\nthe war. As a result, there are still high-risk areas\r\ncontaining unexploded devices in 13 of the country’s\r\ndepartments. Volunteer fire brigades are participating\r\nin the fight to eradicate these weapons, which includes\r\nthe efforts of 38 officers gathering information,\r\nmarking mined areas and educating nearby populations\r\nof the dangers of landmines. In addition, the army has\r\nbeen involved in destroying these devices where they\r\nare found. In Guatemala we are also making provisions\r\nfor the complete removal by 2005 of remaining devices\r\nfrom the 13 high-risk departments. We have\r\nencountered some difficulties, including rough terrain\r\nand poor weather. With regard to providing emergency\r\nmedical assistance, some sites are only accessible by\r\nhelicopter during the rainy season. The lack of accurate\r\nmaps also makes planning difficult. It is estimated that\r\nthere are still 6,000 unexploded devices in Guatemala.\r\nGuatemala has no mines in its arsenal.\r\nWith respect to Honduras, combatants in the\r\nNicaraguan civil war laid anti-personnel mines on both\r\nsides of the Honduras-Nicaragua border during the\r\n1980s. The departments of Choluteca, El Paraíso,\r\nOlancho and Cortés have been found to contain\r\nlandmines, and all affected areas have been properly\r\nmarked. The date originally set for demining has been\r\npushed back due to problems related to the weather,\r\nharsh terrain and difficulties with emergency medical\r\nevacuations. It is hoped that mine removal activities\r\ncan be completed by December 2002, when the last\r\nremaining landmines will be removed along the border\r\nbetween Nicaragua and Choluteca. Honduras has also\r\ndestroyed its warehoused arsenals of mines.\r\nCosta Rica has never produced, imported,\r\nstockpiled or used anti-personnel mines. As in the case\r\nof Honduras, the problem of mines on its northern\r\nborder is due to the fact that mines were laid there by\r\narmed forces involved in the Nicaraguan conflict of the\r\n1980s. Due to financial problems, the demining\r\nprogramme has suffered serious setbacks, especially\r\nsince December 2001. At the moment it has been\r\nsuspended, pending international assistance. An\r\nestimated 1,800 mines remain in the border areas of\r\nPocosol, Upala and La Cruz. Affected areas include the\r\nsectors of Los Chiles, Tablitas, Isla Chica, La Trocha,\r\nPocosol, San Isidro and others. Both the Ministry for\r\nPublic Health and the Ministry for Education have\r\ncontinued their educational campaigns on how to avoid\r\nthe danger of mines in affected areas.\r\nA national demining programme was carried out\r\nby the Government of El Salvador from March 1993 to\r\nJanuary 1994, with the participation of the armed\r\nforces and the Frente Farabundo Martí para la\r\nLiberación Nacional. The United Nations office in El\r\nSalvador, the United Nations Observer Mission in El\r\nSalvador and the United Nations Children’s Fund\r\n(UNICEF) provided support for the programme. In the\r\nlast year, El Salvador’s armed forces have carried out\r\nseveral ordnance-removal programmes involving\r\npreviously undetected devices that had been discovered\r\nwhen persons were injured. El Salvador has no\r\nstockpiles of anti-personnel mines.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\nNicaragua, which is the most heavily mined\r\ncountry in Central America, is believed to have had\r\naround 135,000 landmines planted on its territory\r\nduring the internal conflict that took place from 1979\r\nto 1990. That figure includes both anti-tank and anti-\r\npersonnel mines. Some 55,000 mines remain to be\r\ndeactivated in various parts of the territory of\r\nNicaragua. Mine removal in Nicaragua has been the\r\nresponsibility of the army’s corps of engineers,\r\nspecifically its Small Demining Units, and is being\r\ncarried out in five areas of operations. Removal has\r\nbeen affected by delays in programming due to\r\nunforeseen circumstances, and is expected to be\r\ncompleted by 2005 instead of 2004 as originally\r\nplanned. On the occasion of the conference on Progress\r\nin demining in the Americas, which was held in\r\nManagua on 27 and 28 August 2002, the Government\r\nof Nicaragua carried out the destruction of the last\r\n18,345 anti-personnel landmines that remained in the\r\ncountry’s arsenals out of the original total of 133,425.\r\nThe Dominican Republic, Panama and Belize\r\nhave never used, produced, imported or stockpiled anti-\r\npersonnel landmines, not even for purposes of training,\r\nand are therefore not affected by mines. However, there\r\nis landmine contamination in Panama as a result of\r\nmilitary and weapons-testing exercises that took place\r\nin the Canal Zone in the three decades prior to 1997.\r\nUNICEF, the Ministries of Health, Education and\r\nForeign Affairs, and non-governmental organizations,\r\nhave begun an educational project to raise awareness of\r\nunexploded devices located near population centres.\r\nAt the conference I just mentioned, vice-ministers\r\nfrom Nicaragua, Costa Rica and El Salvador, along\r\nwith representatives from Colombia, Honduras and\r\nPeru, declared the following.\r\n“We urgently call on friendly countries that\r\ncomprise the donor community for humanitarian\r\ndemining, and especially on States parties to the\r\nOttawa Convention, not to abandon or suspend\r\nthe allocation of resources for countries of the\r\nAmericas that have not yet completed their\r\ndemining programmes and integrated mine action\r\nprogrammes” .\r\nIn addition, they called on international partners\r\nto continue and increase technical and financial\r\nassistance to countries that have met their\r\ncommitments to signing, ratifying and implementing\r\ntheir obligations under the Ottawa Convention.  They\r\nalso agreed to refocus efforts on attaining humanitarian\r\ngoals under the Convention and on international\r\ncooperation and assistance.\r\nWe hope that every country will cooperate in\r\norder to eradicate the problem of mines from the face\r\nof the Earth. We also hope that we will one day be able\r\nto declare our planet free of anti-personnel mines and\r\nother explosive devices with indiscriminate effects.\r\nMr. Redai (Ethiopia): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on mine action.\r\nThe report highlights the daunting challenges\r\nlandmines continue to pose in many parts of the world\r\nand the collective efforts under way to mitigate the\r\nchallenge. In this regard, we are grateful for the central\r\nrole which the United Nations is playing in assessing\r\nthe ways and means of minimizing and curbing the\r\nimpact of landmines around the world and also for its\r\ncoordination of the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity against this menace.\r\nCertainly, the increased international cooperation\r\nand coordination on mine action have registered\r\nencouraging progress in recent times. However, the\r\nchallenges ahead remain enormous. As is noted in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, landmines continue to be a\r\nsource of human suffering and hindrance to socio-\r\neconomic progress in many countries. The availability\r\nof over 30 million landmines makes Africa the most\r\nheavily mined and the primary victim of these deadly\r\nweapons. As a result, conflict-ravaged Africa is left\r\nwith millions of maimed people who need immediate\r\nsupport.\r\nThe impact of landmines in Ethiopia is no less\r\nsevere than in any other African country. Ethiopia’s\r\nexposure to the severe problem of landmines,\r\nunexploded ordinance and contamination goes back to\r\nthe Italian invasion in 1936. The level of the challenge\r\nwas exacerbated by the unprovoked Eritrean aggression\r\nagainst Ethiopia in the 1998-2000 so-called border\r\nconflict.\r\nWhile Ethiopia’s large land mass is mostly mined,\r\nthe northern and north-eastern regions of the country\r\nalong the border with Eritrea and the south-eastern\r\nregion are highly exposed. The intensity and wide\r\ncoverage of these deadly weapons continue to hamper\r\npost-war rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts,\r\nparticularly in the North. As a result of the Ethiopian-\r\nEritrean war, over 340,000 persons displaced from\r\nborder towns and villages are still unable to return to\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\ntheir homes and to resume normal lives. Landmines are\r\ntaking their toll. They continue killing, injuring and\r\nthreatening civilians in those highly infested regions.\r\nBetween September 2001 and May 2002, 330 civilian\r\ncasualties and injuries were recorded in that part of the\r\ncountry.\r\nHaving recognized the incalculable humanitarian\r\nand socio-economic consequences of landmines and\r\nunexploded ordinance, the Government of Ethiopia has\r\naccorded demining high priority since 1991. It\r\nestablished an Ethiopian demining project in 1995, but\r\nits effective demining operation was interrupted\r\nfollowing the Ethiopian-Eritrean war. The cessation of\r\nhostilities between the two countries with the signing\r\nof the Algiers Agreement created an enabling\r\nenvironment for the resumption of the Government’s\r\nmine-action programme.\r\nThe Ethiopian Mine Action Office has been\r\nreorganized and effectively operating since February\r\n2001 to address the all-round challenges of mine-\r\nrelated issues. The Ethiopian Mine Action Office is\r\ncoordinating and executing all national mine-action\r\nactivities meeting international standards of\r\nhumanitarian demining.\r\nSufficient data and information on landmines are\r\nprerequisites for a socio-economic Landmine Impact\r\nSurvey. In Ethiopia, Norwegian Peoples Aid is\r\nconducting a landmine survey with assistance from the\r\nSurvey Action Center — an organization of the\r\nVietnam Veterans of America Foundation — and the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP),\r\nwith a start-up fund from the Government of Germany.\r\nThe United Nations Mine Action Service, UNDP, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and other United\r\nNations agencies are also engaged in assisting mine-\r\naction activities in Ethiopia. The joint United Nations\r\nlandmine assessment mission to Ethiopia helped in the\r\ndevelopment of a national capacity for mine action and\r\ndonors’ support therefor.\r\nWhile my Government is fully committed to\r\nmaking the country a mine-free land, the level of mine\r\ncontamination and its socio-economic impact limit the\r\nGovernment’s capacity to respond to the challenges,\r\nand it is in this context that we encourage the\r\ninternational community to increase its present\r\nhumanitarian demining-capacity support to the desired\r\nlevel. In this spirit, it is critical that the support of the\r\ninternational community for mine-action programmes\r\nbe enhanced in the areas of training, socio-economic\r\nimpact surveys, rapid-response teams, mine detection,\r\nmine awareness, victim assistance programmes and\r\nenhancing the organizational capacity of the Ethiopian\r\nMine Action Office.\r\nIn closing, my delegation wishes to seize this\r\nopportunity to sincerely thank all donors, the United\r\nnation system and the Bretton Woods institutions,\r\nparticularly the World Bank, for their unstinting\r\nsupport in our effort to have a mine-free Ethiopia.\r\nMs. Espíndola (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\npresence of mines in the world has had grave economic\r\nand social consequences for people living in affected\r\nareas, due to their latent threat to local populations and\r\nthe consequent impossibility of using broad areas of\r\ncultivable land, irrigation canals and roadways. It is\r\nincreasingly evident that, in order to consolidate peace\r\nfollowing a conflict, it is necessary to deal with the\r\ntens of millions of mines that remain scattered around\r\nvarious regions.\r\nThe existence of mines aroused the concern of the\r\ninternational community, leading to the Ottawa process\r\nthat culminated in the adoption of the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and\r\nTransfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their\r\nDestruction, a critical instrument to which Ecuador is\r\nparty. At the Millennium Summit, the heads of State\r\nand Government urged States to accede to the\r\nConvention so as to eliminate the dangers involved in\r\nthe use of mines.\r\nThe United Nations, aware of the grave\r\nconsequences of the presence of landmines in various\r\nparts of the world, the number of innocent victims and\r\nthe need to confront and resolve this crisis, and as a\r\ncontribution to world peace, has adopted several\r\nmeasures that Ecuador supports. In this context, I wish\r\non behalf of my delegation to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the report he has submitted to the\r\nAssembly. That document describes the progress made\r\nby the Organization in the pursuit of the goals proposed\r\nunder the United Nations Mine Action Strategy.\r\nMy delegation concurs with the view that, if the\r\nwork of the United Nations institutions entrusted with\r\nmine action is to be fruitful, it must have clear goals\r\nand concrete plans that will allow us to determine the\r\nprogress made over a specific period of time. At the\r\nsame time, we consider unacceptable the delay of more\r\nthan three years in the delivery of funds that donor\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\ncountries earmarked for Ecuador through the United\r\nNations Mine Action Service for its demining\r\nprogrammes and to help us move forward towards\r\nfulfilling our obligations under the Convention.\r\nMoreover, an unjustifiable deduction was made from\r\nthat cooperation on the basis of so-called\r\nadministrative expenses, which not only limits our\r\nability to pursue demining activities, but also runs\r\ncounter to the principles of cooperation and\r\ndiscourages undertakings being arduously carried out\r\nby developing countries, such as Ecuador.\r\nMy delegation believes that the various mine-\r\nrelated activities should be carried out simultaneously.\r\nEliminating the use of this type of weapon, removing\r\nplanted mines, warning of dangers to the populations at\r\nrisk through the distribution of maps and the marking\r\nof mined fields, and rehabilitating the victims of\r\naccidents caused by mines are all essential activities in\r\ndealing with this serious problem affecting various\r\ncountries of the world.\r\nThe international standards for activities relative\r\nto mines, prepared for the United Nations International\r\nCentre for Humanitarian Demining, are a valuable\r\ncontribution to strengthening standards, guidelines and\r\nthe actions taken at the country level. In this context,\r\nEcuador considers that distributing translations of\r\nthose standards is a high priority.\r\nEcuador has not escaped the serious situation\r\ncaused by the presence of this type of weapon. There\r\nare still mines in areas along its border with Peru,\r\naffecting development in the region.\r\nEcuador, by virtue of its commitments relative to\r\nthe Ottawa Convention and through its commitment to\r\nits policy of defending international humanitarian law,\r\nhas completed the destruction of stockpiled mines on\r\n11 September 2001. It has thus complied with the\r\nManagua Challenge by carrying out that destruction\r\nwithin four years of the entry into force of the\r\nConvention.\r\nWith respect to the removal of planted mines,\r\nEcuador has been carrying out intensive work.\r\nConsiderable areas have been cleared and certified.\r\nHowever, mine removal and clearance efforts in areas\r\nof difficult terrain in the southern and eastern provinces\r\nare still pending. The nature of such terrain poses great\r\ndifficulties for access and results in elevated costs and\r\ngreater risks for mine-action workers.\r\nIn order to meet the goal of combating the\r\npresence of mines in the country, Ecuador signed an\r\nagreement with the Organization of American States.\r\nThrough their valuable contribution, Canada and the\r\nUnited States, as well as Japan, have contributed to our\r\nplans for the destruction and removal of mines carried\r\nout in my country.\r\nCooperation given to the developing countries in\r\nthis area is essential for continuing demining efforts,\r\ndestroying anti-personnel mines and assisting victims.\r\nEcuador makes a special appeal to those countries able\r\nto offer such assistance, since the urgent economic and\r\nsocial needs faced by developing countries prevent\r\nthem from allocating greater resources to mine-related\r\nactions.\r\nDespite those limitations, Ecuador is determined\r\nto firmly continue this process. My country has\r\nreiterated its commitment to continuing those efforts at\r\nthe regional and multilateral levels. In this context, we\r\nshould mention the Declaration of the South American\r\nzone of peace and cooperation, which was approved at\r\nthe Second Meeting of Presidents of South America,\r\nheld in Guayaquil last July, as well as the commitment\r\nto contribute to making the Western Hemisphere a zone\r\nfree of anti-personnel landmines.\r\nIn May and June of this year, the Demining\r\nCentre of Ecuador (CENDESMI), responsible for\r\ncoordinating these efforts in my country, carried out\r\neducational campaigns among the population in areas\r\naffected by the presence of mines, in particular, in\r\nareas used for agriculture and commerce. Nonetheless,\r\nfunding is needed to continue those efforts.\r\nCENDESMI hopes to convert the centre for mine\r\nclearance training, operated by the Army Corps of\r\nEngineers, into an international demining school. The\r\nvaried topography of Ecuador, combined with the\r\nexperience accumulated by Ecuadorian demining\r\npersonnel over several years of systematic work,\r\nenables us to train sappers to carry out these tasks in\r\nvaried terrain.\r\nAllow me to appeal to the international\r\ncommunity to make the Ottawa Convention a universal\r\ninstrument. Mine clearance is a humanitarian activity\r\nthat seeks to restore hope and dignity to the persons\r\nand populations affected. Its objective is to recover the\r\nmined lands and to develop them for the benefit of\r\nthose people. The conscious, responsible and\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.52\r\npermanent effort and cooperation of the international\r\ncommunity are required to achieve that goal.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 28. The General\r\nAssembly has thus concluded the present stage of its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 28.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.06 p.m.\r\n"
