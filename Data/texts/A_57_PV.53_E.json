(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAfrican Industrialization Day\r\nThe President: Before turning to the item on the\r\nagenda, I would like to remind the General Assembly\r\nthat today, 20 November, is Africa Industrialization\r\nDay. Today, the United Nations family observes Africa\r\nIndustrialization Day with the collective spirit of\r\nsupporting and promoting the development of the\r\nAfrican continent. It is also an occasion to remind\r\nourselves that more than 30 of the world’s 48 least\r\ndeveloped countries are located in Africa.\r\nWe are at the end of the Second Industrial\r\nDevelopment Decade for Africa. The Decade, covering\r\nthe period 1993 to 2002, was declared by the General\r\nAssembly in order to focus on promoting sustainable\r\nindustrial growth in the region. The United Nations\r\nIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the\r\nlead agency for this programme, has just released the\r\nIndustrial Development Report 2000/2003. The report\r\nprovides an analysis of industrial performance\r\nworldwide and relevant rankings. It is an\r\nacknowledged fact that basic industry, and\r\nmanufacturing industries in particular, are\r\nindispensable to economic growth. A skilled work\r\nforce including managerial cadres, access to capital and\r\ntechnology, good governance and peace and security\r\nare only some of the preconditions for industry to\r\nflourish. It is expected that by the year 2025 more than\r\n50 per cent of Africa’s population will be living in\r\ncities. In that context, the harnessing of new\r\ninformation and communication technologies will be\r\nkey to rapid sustainable development.\r\nThis year, the special theme for this Day is new\r\ninformation and communication technologies (NICTs).\r\nIt is not a coincidence that through NICT — one of the\r\nmost visible development tools — opportunities for the\r\nindustrialization of Africa have expanded. We find that\r\nNICTs are at the heart of mechanisms linked to\r\ndeveloping new markets and improving existing ones\r\nand that they have the capability of bringing villages\r\nand nations closer together by facilitating electronic\r\naccess to global knowledge and creating an\r\nenvironment for learning.\r\nThe programme of action envisaged in the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which\r\nwas conceived and finalized more than a year ago\r\nunder the auspices of Africa’s leaders, set itself the\r\ngoals of promoting accelerated growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment, eradicating widespread and severe\r\npoverty and halting the marginalization of the continent\r\nin the globalization process. NICTs are an important\r\ntool for achieving those objectives: NICTs would\r\nfacilitate human development, accelerate intra-Africa\r\ntrade and improve access to markets of developed\r\ncountries. Furthermore, NEPAD foresees the crucial\r\nrole of NICTs in the context of Africa’s recovery and\r\ncalls for concrete and practical steps to develop a\r\nproper information and technology infrastructure.\r\nThe United Nations family, including UNIDO,\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the Food\r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nand the International Labour Organization, should\r\ncontinue their support for removing the many\r\nconstraints that industry faces on using NICTs, through\r\nawareness creation and building capacity for national\r\ninformation networking activities and through\r\nfacilitating public-private partnerships in the context of\r\nlessons learned from the United Nations New Agenda\r\nfor the Development of Africa in the 1990s and the two\r\nIndustrial Development Decades.\r\nThis is a day to renew the commitment of all\r\nparties — including the African Union, the Economic\r\nCommission for Africa, the Conference of African\r\nMinisters of Industry and the country-specific bilateral\r\npublic and private partnerships — to the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of Africa.\r\nAgenda item 22\r\nCooperation

(A/57/L.16)\r\nThe President: This morning, the General\r\nAssembly will begin a joint debate on sub-items (a) to\r\n(s) of agenda item 22.\r\nI give the floor to the Executive Secretary of the\r\nPreparatory Commission for the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, Mr. Wolfgang\r\nHoffmann, to introduce the report of the Preparatory\r\nCommission.\r\nMr. Hoffmann (Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty Organization): I am pleased to be here\r\ntoday to report on the activities of the Preparatory\r\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty Organization. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty (CTBT) is one of the cornerstones of the\r\ninternational non-proliferation and disarmament\r\nregime. Its total ban on any nuclear test explosions in\r\nany environment will help in ending the development\r\nof ever more sophisticated nuclear weapons, as well as\r\nin arresting the proliferation of these weapons.\r\nTo date, the Treaty has been signed by a total of\r\n166 States and ratified by 97. Thirty-one of those\r\nratifications are by annex 2 States — the 44 States\r\nlisted in the Treaty whose ratification is required for\r\nentry into force. The level and pace of signatures and\r\nratifications indicates the firm support of the\r\ninternational community for the Treaty. The conference\r\non facilitating entry into force of the CTBT, which was\r\nheld in New York in 2001, led to a significant increase\r\nin signatures and ratifications.\r\nThe Preparatory Commission for the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\r\nwas established six years ago to carry out the necessary\r\npreparations for the effective implementation of the\r\nCTBT and to prepare for the first session of the\r\nConference of the States Parties to the Treaty. The\r\nmain activity of the Commission and its Provisional\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nTechnical Secretariat during recent years was the\r\nestablishment of the verification regime to monitor\r\nTreaty compliance.\r\nThe global verification regime needs to be\r\noperational at the Treaty’s entry into force. It will be\r\ncapable of detecting nuclear explosions underground,\r\nin water and in the atmosphere.\r\nThe International Monitoring System (IMS)\r\nconsists of 321 monitoring stations and 16 radionuclide\r\nlaboratories that monitor the Earth for evidence of a\r\nnuclear explosion. The IMS uses seismic,\r\nhydroacoustic and infrasound monitoring technologies\r\nto detect possible nuclear explosions. Radionuclide\r\nmonitoring technologies collect and analyse air\r\nsamples for evidence of the physical products created\r\nby nuclear explosions. Progress in establishing these\r\nfacilities has been good, considering the engineering\r\nchallenges that face the establishment of this first\r\nworldwide monitoring network. Currently, 43 per cent\r\nof the monitoring system is operational.\r\nGood progress in establishing the IMS was in\r\ngreat part made possible by those States hosting\r\nfacilities. I would like to take this opportunity to thank\r\nStates for their help and flexibility, and express my\r\nhope that the good cooperation will continue for the\r\nremainder of the build-up process and beyond.\r\nA Global Communications Infrastructure carries\r\nthe seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide\r\ndata from IMS facilities to the International Data\r\nCentre. This global satellite communications network\r\nis also used to distribute data and reports relevant to\r\nTreaty verification to the States signatories.\r\nThe International Data Centre supports the\r\nverification responsibilities of States signatories by\r\nproviding the products and services needed for\r\neffective Treaty monitoring. The Centre receives raw\r\ndata from monitoring stations around the world, which\r\nit processes, analyses and transmits to States for final\r\nanalysis. Improved software is enhancing precision in\r\nlocating the events which produce seismic,\r\nhydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide data, and\r\nthe verification system as a whole is being\r\ncontinuously developed and refined.\r\nOn-site inspections (OSIs) are provided for in the\r\nTreaty as a final verification measure, and the\r\ndevelopment of a draft OSI operational manual is a key\r\ntask for the Preparatory Commission. The Commission\r\nis also acquiring inspection equipment and building up\r\na pool of potential inspectors. A realistic field\r\nexperiment was conducted in Kazakhstan in October\r\n2002. The results of this experiment will facilitate\r\npreparations for real on-site inspections.\r\nWhile the primary purpose of the CTBT\r\nverification regime is to verify compliance with the\r\nTreaty effectively, the verification technologies, data\r\nand products have the potential to offer a range of\r\nuseful civil and scientific applications for sustainable\r\ndevelopment and the betterment of human welfare. In\r\nthis regard, the Commission organized, at London in\r\nMay this year, with the strong support of the\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom, a Senior Experts’\r\nDiscussion on Civil and Scientific Applications of\r\nCTBT Verification Technologies.\r\nSeismic, hydroacoustic and infrasound data can\r\nbe used in studies of the Earth’s structure and for\r\nresearch on earthquakes, volcanic eruption forecasting,\r\ntsunami warnings, underwater event location and sea\r\ntemperature and climate change monitoring. The data\r\ncan assist in minimizing the effect of volcanic\r\neruptions on civil aviation and can be used for oceanic\r\nswell research and atmospheric and meteorological\r\nstudies. Radionuclide technologies offer opportunities\r\nfor detecting radionuclide dispersion, monitoring\r\nradiation levels and studying natural radioactivity, as\r\nwell as for supporting atmospheric studies, biological\r\nresearch and environmental change tracking. Follow-up\r\nmeetings and seminars are already taking place among\r\npolicy-makers and scientists in support of the work of\r\nthe Commission.\r\nThe Commission organizes training programmes\r\nand workshops in support of States signatories in the\r\nenhancement of national technical capability for the\r\nimplementation of the Treaty. They include training\r\ncourses for IMS station operators in all four\r\nverification technologies, training courses for data\r\nanalysis, storage and management, on-site inspection\r\ntechnologies, workshops for global communications\r\ninfrastructure and workshops on international\r\ncooperation and national implementation of the Treaty.\r\nIn addition, the Commission promotes\r\ninternational cooperation among States signatories for\r\nthem to participate in the fullest possible exchange\r\nrelating to these verification technologies and the\r\nestablishment and operation of national data centres.\r\nSince my last report to the General Assembly,\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\ninternational cooperation workshops were hosted by\r\nSenegal and Kenya. Next week I will open a workshop\r\nfor the Caribbean region in Jamaica and for 2003\r\nworkshops are scheduled in Azerbaijan, Fiji and\r\nMalaysia.\r\nAlong the same lines, the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization’s Preparatory\r\nCommission and the Agency for the Prohibition of\r\nNuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean,\r\nwhich share the same objective of enhancing\r\ninternational peace and security, concluded a\r\nRelationship Agreement in Vienna on 18 September.\r\nThis is the first agreement concluded between the\r\nPreparatory Commission and a regional nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone organization.\r\nOn 15 June 2000, the General Assembly adopted\r\nthe Agreement to Regulate the Relationship between\r\nthe United Nations and the Preparatory Commission\r\nfor the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nOrganization, thereby accepting the Preparatory\r\nCommission as a new member of the United Nations\r\nfamily. The Commission remains an independent\r\ninternational organization, but has been given formal\r\nstatus by which it can contribute to the goals of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nUnder this Agreement, the Commission’s links\r\nand interactions with the United Nations and its\r\nprogrammes, funds and specialized agencies are\r\ndeveloping even further. In order to fully contribute to\r\nthe work of the United Nations family, the Preparatory\r\nCommission has requested full membership in the\r\nUnited Nations system’s Chief Executives Board for\r\nCoordination (CEB). The Preparatory Commission\r\nalready participates in the work of the High Level\r\nCommittees of the CEB. In light of the disarmament\r\nrelated issues in the Millennium Declaration, we feel it\r\nparticularly important that the Preparatory Commission\r\nshould be able to contribute fully to the work of the\r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nWe believe that it would be of great significance\r\nfor the General Assembly to be kept abreast of the\r\nrapid development of our new and growing\r\norganization on a closer basis. In times of increasing\r\nconcern about the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the reports of organizations specialized in\r\nthis field should be of particular relevance to the\r\ndeliberations of the General Assembly. However, we\r\nunderstand that the revitalization of the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is of utmost importance and that the\r\nclustering and biannualization of the agenda item on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations was an important part of the\r\nendeavours in this respect. We will therefore look for\r\nalternative ways to inform the General Assembly about\r\nthe outcome of the next conference on facilitating entry\r\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty, to be held in 2003.\r\nI am grateful to Ambassador Bota of Romania,\r\nthe current Chairman of the Preparatory Commission,\r\nfor the excellent work he has performed in Vienna. I\r\nalso want to thank Romania for introducing the draft\r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Preparatory Commission this year.\r\nIn closing, I would like to emphasize that six\r\nyears after its opening for signature, the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has the\r\nconfirmed support of the international community and\r\nis recognized as playing an important role in nuclear\r\ndisarmament and in preventing the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons. By signing and ratifying the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, States\r\nconfirm their commitment to these shared goals.\r\nMr. Pfirter (Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons): It is a great privilege for me to\r\naddress the United Nations General Assembly for the\r\nfirst time since my appointment as Director-General of\r\nthe Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).\r\nI would like also to extend to you, Mr President,\r\nmy most sincere congratulations for your election to\r\nthis position, to which you bring experience,\r\ndiplomatic skills and the respected voice of a country,\r\nthe Czech Republic, whose contribution to the\r\nobjectives and purposes of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention (CWC) are well known.\r\nThe presence of a Director-General of an\r\norganization such as the OPCW at the United Nations\r\nuniversal body, the General Assembly, is as natural as\r\nit is necessary. It is natural because our Convention,\r\nand the organization it brought to life, are legitimate\r\nexpressions of multilateralism in a field —\r\ndisarmament and international security — where the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations is widely recognized.\r\nIt is necessary because the CWC and the OPCW have a\r\nmessage to convey: this year and in fact every day, our\r\nwork, like yours, simply cannot stop.\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nThe United Nations has recognized the OPCW as\r\nthe organization responsible for activities to achieve\r\nthe comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons in\r\naccordance with the Convention. At the same time, the\r\nOPCW, as stated by the Relationship Agreement\r\nbetween the two organizations, recognizes the central\r\nrole of the United Nations in international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nClose cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the OPCW seems self-evident. We are determined\r\nto work jointly to achieve mutual objectives — by\r\nmaintaining a close working relationship at all relevant\r\nlevels and by making sure that effective coordination is\r\nachieved in the various areas where the United Nations\r\nCharter and our mandate can converge for the benefit\r\nof disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nThe organization I represent is the single\r\ninternational institution providing at the same time for\r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and international\r\ncooperation and assistance.\r\nWe verify the destruction of the huge existing\r\narsenals of chemical weapons. We monitor chemical\r\nindustry and trade related activities in listed chemicals\r\nto make sure they are consistent with the provisions of\r\nthe Convention. We assist and remain ready to provide\r\nhelp for member States in need of reinforcing or\r\ncreating their own protective capacities and, in cases of\r\nattacks or threats of attacks with chemical weapons, we\r\nwill stand beside those in need.\r\nThese three unique elements — disarmament,\r\nnon-proliferation and international cooperation and\r\nassistance — find in the CWC, through the OPCW, the\r\nindispensable articulation to become integral parts of a\r\nsingle effort. In this sense, the CWC stands as an\r\nexample of what can be achieved when the political\r\nwill exists to tackle questions of global concern\r\nthrough the formidable power of an internationally\r\nagreed instrument.\r\nAs I explained in my address to the First\r\nCommittee last month, member States of the CWC are\r\nmaking substantive progress in the achievement of the\r\ngoals set out by the Treaty.\r\nDestruction of chemical weapons continues. And\r\nthis is indeed crucial, as we are not talking here of a\r\nmere clean-up operation of the remnants of the cold\r\nwar. We are dealing with weapons of mass destruction,\r\ntens of thousands of munitions, seas of deadly chemical\r\nagents — all weapons of choice for terrorist groups,\r\nweapons that have been used in recent inter-State\r\nconflicts and that unfortunately remain within the\r\ninventories of some States.\r\nOPCW inspectors are active in checking\r\ndestruction activities in all the declared possessor\r\nState’s facilities. On this front, the task is Herculean,\r\nbut progress is being made on a continuing basis.\r\nIn the United States, the goal of the destruction of\r\n20 per cent of stockpiles of category 1 weapons has\r\nbeen completed. India has also met this crucial\r\nthreshold. Another State party is making progress\r\ntowards that goal, with approval given by the\r\nConference of States Parties for it to meet this target by\r\nApril 2003.\r\nIn Russia, where the largest stockpile of about\r\n40,000 metric tonnes of warfare agents remain to be\r\ndestroyed, agreements have been reached within the\r\nOPCW. A number of decisions have been taken that\r\nwill hopefully enable the Russian Federation to meet\r\nits obligations to destroy chemical weapons and to\r\nconvert some facilities to permitted purposes.\r\nIn that respect, we are greatly heartened, and\r\nwarmly welcome, the 10 plus 10 over 10 initiative for\r\nthese and related purposes over the next 10 years\r\napproved by the G-8 countries at the Kananaskis\r\nSummit.\r\nSlowly but surely, the OPCW, together with its\r\nmember States, is creating the conditions for a world\r\nactually free from these weapons of mass destruction.\r\nFrom a technological and scientific point of view, our\r\nwork is very demanding, as it deals with listed\r\nchemicals that, in most cases, do have legitimate\r\ncivilian applications. The same can be said about the\r\ntechnologies involved, which fall under the well-\r\nknown label of dual use. That is why we have to make\r\nsure that the Technical Secretariat is in a position to\r\nuphold the core provisions of the Convention in the\r\nlight of the breathtaking pace of progress in the\r\nchemical industry worldwide. This is an area where we\r\nare currently concentrating our efforts in order to\r\nensure the future relevance of the CWC to all States\r\nparties.\r\nWhile we continue our relentless efforts at\r\noversight and our activities to destroy chemical\r\nweapons, we must note that this undertaking will\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\ndemand ever-greater efforts from the organization in\r\nthe very near future. Possessor States are announcing\r\nthat new destruction facilities are coming on-line. This\r\nwill have a considerable impact on our verification\r\nplan, which will grow accordingly.\r\nThe anticipated steep rise in verification activities\r\nis a clear indication of the challenges ahead for the\r\norganization. But the quantitative increase in\r\nverification activities is not everything that is involved,\r\nbecause the Chemical Weapons Convention is not only\r\nan instrument of multilateral disarmament. In parallel\r\nwith the monitoring functions at chemical weapons\r\nrelated facilities, the CWC addresses the equally\r\ncomplex, and certainly more elusive, problem of the\r\nproliferation of instruments of chemical warfare. Given\r\nthe vast scope of the chemical industry worldwide,\r\nefficient control of chemical proliferation is an arduous\r\ntask that the Technical Secretariat has to face within\r\nthe margins of its limited resources, especially against\r\nthe backdrop of the growing number of facilities to be\r\nmonitored.\r\nThe number of inspections will rise, but the\r\nnature of the exercise will also be altered by the\r\ncombined influence of new technologies, evolving\r\nindustrial methods and the lessons learned in the past\r\nfew years by our inspectors. While facilities producing\r\nschedule 1 and 2 chemicals will permanently focus the\r\npriority attention of the OPCW, we shall also widen the\r\nscope of active industry monitoring activities in\r\ngeneral terms. This process will be gradual, and it will\r\nbe defined in consultation with member States and be\r\nfully in line with the Convention.\r\nInternational cooperation and assistance are much\r\nmore than good intentions under the CWC. Our\r\nactivities in the field of international cooperation allow\r\nour member States to become full partners in the\r\ndischarge of their Treaty obligations. As it is often\r\nsaid, the CWC is not a self-executing document. It\r\nrequires constant interaction and an ongoing\r\ninterrelationship between the Technical Secretariat and\r\nmember States through their national authorities. This\r\nis indispensable both for verification purposes and for\r\nthe enactment of implementing legislation and\r\nchemical exports controls at the national level.\r\nArticle X of the CWC mandates us to provide\r\nassistance in the case of the use or threat of use of\r\nchemical weapons. In the light of the importance of\r\nthat commitment of the OPCW, we have been actively\r\nworking to improve our preparedness and availability,\r\nnot only in actual emergencies, but also in the area of\r\ncapacity-building. Two months ago in Croatia, we\r\nconducted our first large-scale exercise, which allowed\r\nus to test our preparedness for chemical attacks and\r\nemergencies in real life conditions. We intend to\r\ncontinue with similar efforts in the near future,\r\nhopefully with the support and contribution of other\r\ninternational organizations, starting with the United\r\nNations, as there are many areas where synergetic\r\nefforts can and must be found in this area.\r\nThreat-perception and a new sense of urgency\r\nhave become apparent after the tragic attacks in the\r\nUnited States in September 2001. Assistance has been\r\nfinally understood as a necessity, especially for States\r\nlacking the resources to protect themselves against the\r\npossibility of an attack with chemical agents.\r\nFollowing the terrorist attacks on the United States on\r\n11 September 2001 and the global realization of the\r\npossibility that terrorists might use weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, an increasing number of States parties\r\nhave invoked the Treaty provisions that request the\r\nTechnical Secretariat to provide expert advice and to\r\nhelp strengthen their protective capacity. An increasing\r\nnumber of protection courses have therefore been\r\npresented by the OPCW in 2002, and some additional\r\ncourses have already been scheduled for 2003 for the\r\nbenefit of member States in Central Asia and Africa.\r\nThe OPCW is not a counter-terrorism agency, but\r\nit is clear that active implementation of the Treaty\r\nprovisions can help against this looming menace.\r\nDoing that through a multilateral instrument like the\r\nCWC has the additional advantage of rallying forces\r\nthat would otherwise remain unconnected at a time\r\nwhen the struggle for already-scarce resources is\r\nbecoming acute.\r\nIn December 2001, States parties and the OPCW\r\nTechnical Secretariat jointly identified a number of\r\nareas where useful contributions could be made to the\r\nstruggle against international terrorism. Those include\r\nthe promotion of universal adherence to the\r\nConvention, enactment of adequate national\r\nimplementing legislation — including penal\r\nlegislation — full and effective implementation of the\r\nprovisions related to the destruction of chemical\r\nweapons capabilities, full and effective implementation\r\nof the provisions related to inspections in the chemical\r\nindustry and transfers of scheduled chemicals to non-\r\nState parties, and the further development of the\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nOPCW’s capabilities to respond to requests for\r\nassistance in cases of use or threat of use of chemical\r\nweapons.\r\nIn addressing the General Assembly, I cannot fail\r\nto mention the high priority we attach to the principle\r\nof the universality of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention. With 147 States parties, the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention already embodies a significant\r\nnumber of Member States of the United Nations. But\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention is an international\r\nagreement open to all States without exception. It is for\r\nthat reason that we have consistently called upon States\r\nthat have not yet done so to ratify or accede to the\r\nTreaty. I repeat that invitation here today. To that end,\r\nwe have also designed several programmes and\r\noutreach initiatives to ensure that all States willing to\r\njoin the family of nations opposing chemical warfare\r\ncan do so easily.\r\nFor a global agreement like this, which entails\r\nsecurity implications for all Member States, ratification\r\nby all is our permanent objective, and we continue to\r\nwork towards that end. We must acknowledge that\r\nsome States outside the purview of the CWC are of\r\nclear proliferation concern. But for others the overall\r\nsecurity scenario prevailing in their respective regions\r\ncould be a determining, and perhaps a deterring, factor.\r\nAll those elements have to be borne in mind when\r\nwe tackle the issue of universality. The overriding\r\nnotion remains, however, that this is a Treaty where all\r\nStates, possessors and non-possessors alike, can benefit\r\nin terms of their own security, first and foremost, and\r\nalso in other important areas relating to the peaceful\r\nuses of chemistry.\r\nIn a few months, in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the CWC, we will conduct the first\r\nReview Conference since the Convention entered into\r\nforce. The principal purpose of the exercise will be to\r\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of the operation of\r\nthe Convention from the legal and technical\r\nstandpoints. The Review Conference will allow us to\r\nlook into the past, to see what has been done and\r\nachieved in the first five years of the Treaty’s operation\r\nand, perhaps more importantly, to identify the most\r\nurgent tasks we will have to face in the next five years.\r\nStates parties will also be able to assess the\r\nimplementation of the verification regime to date, and\r\nprovide direction to the organization to continue its\r\nmonitoring of the destruction process and of\r\ncompliance. During the Review Conference, Member\r\nStates will also have an opportunity to consider any\r\nscientific and technological developments affecting the\r\nCWC. Above all, this first retrospective and, at the\r\nsame time, forward-looking exercise will be an ideal\r\nopportunity to reaffirm the validity and importance of\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nIf any lesson can be learned from recent events, it\r\nwill confirm the continued urgency and validity of\r\nconcerns over weapons of mass destruction. That is\r\nwhy we expect the widest participation of Member\r\nStates at the highest possible level, as well as the active\r\npresence of international organizations and civil\r\nsociety, next April in The Hague. I do hope that the\r\nUnited Nations, as the principal Organization dealing\r\nwith matters related to the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity, will signal through its presence the high\r\npriority we all attach to efforts aimed at eliminating\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn conclusion, let us remember that chemical\r\nweapons happen to be those which the international\r\ncommunity has agreed to dispose of completely,\r\nwithout exception and in a verifiable manner. Let us\r\nnever forget that the Chemical Weapons Convention is\r\nour common contract to achieve this lofty goal. Last\r\nbut not least, let us always support the Organisation for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is no\r\nmore and no less than the guarantor of that process.\r\nMr. Abelian (Armenia): In my capacity as\r\nChairman-in-Office of the Black Sea Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (BSEC) for the six-month\r\nterm starting 1 November 2002, I have the honour on\r\nbehalf of the sponsors listed in document A/57/L.11, as\r\nwell as of Ukraine and The Former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia, to introduce the draft resolution entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization”.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to express our\r\ngratitude to the Albanian chairmanship of BSEC for the\r\nsuccessful conduct and conclusion of its term and the\r\npreparation of this comprehensive draft resolution. I\r\nshould also like to extend our thanks and appreciation\r\nto the Secretary-General of BSEC, Ambassador Valeri\r\nChechelashvili, who is joining us today in this Hall, for\r\nthe leadership that he provides in running the day-to-\r\nday business of the organization. We very much look\r\nforward to continuing to work with him in his efforts to\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nbuild the efficiency and effectiveness of the\r\norganization.\r\nThis year, we have been celebrating the 10-year\r\nanniversary of BSEC. When it was established in 1992,\r\nno one could assure that this intergovernmental forum\r\nwould survive. Yet, 10 years later, have we not only\r\nmanaged to stay together, but also to build on our\r\nexperience and achievements to evolve into a viable\r\nregional organization. This spirit has been marked by\r\nthe enhancement of BSEC’s effectiveness and the\r\nexpansion of the scope of its activities. BSEC has\r\nbrought together 11 member States with varied\r\nresources, histories and economic conditions, as well\r\nas with some major political problems among certain\r\nmember States. What we have in common is the shared\r\ngoal to promote economic development, stability and\r\nprosperity for our countries and around the Black Sea.\r\nWe realized that, by combining and maximizing\r\nour resources, we would be better able to compete in\r\nand benefit from the modern globalized economy. One\r\nof the major goals of BSEC has always been the\r\npromotion of intra-regional cooperation and the\r\ndevelopment of effective partnership with other\r\nregional and international organizations, particularly\r\nthe European Union and the United Nations system.\r\nThe adoption of BSEC’s charter in 1998 and its\r\ntransformation into a regional organization in 1999\r\nwere key qualitative steps forward in ensuring its role\r\nas an important tool for regional cooperation. Its\r\ngranting of observer status in the United Nations in\r\n1999 provided an international legal identity and thus a\r\nfurther positive spur to continue pursuing its goals and\r\nprinciples. In this spirit, BSEC has gained tremendous\r\ninstitutional growth and has successfully completed its\r\nformative stage. The creation of a system of related\r\nbodies and subsidiary organs has ensured its\r\ntransformation into a full-fledged international\r\norganization and enhanced its effectiveness.\r\nThe draft resolution before us today is a\r\ncomprehensive and result-oriented document. It\r\nincorporates and reflects the major goals, principles\r\nand objectives laid down in the BSEC charter and the\r\ndeclarations adopted at its summit meetings in 1999\r\nand 2002. The draft resolution emphasizes the\r\nstrengthening of regional cooperation in various fields,\r\nsuch as trade, finance, energy, transport,\r\ncommunications, agriculture, health care,\r\nenvironmental protection, science, combating\r\norganized crime, terrorism, illegal migration and illicit\r\ntrafficking of drugs and weapons.\r\nThe draft resolution also attaches great\r\nimportance to the enhancement of relations with the\r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations system. It\r\nwelcomes the signing of cooperation agreements\r\nbetween BSEC and the Economic Commission for\r\nEurope and between BSEC and the United Nations\r\nEnvironment Programme, while the cooperation of\r\nBSEC with the Food and Agriculture Organization of\r\nthe United Nations, the United Nations Conference on\r\nTrade and Development and the World Trade\r\nOrganization are considered to be priority issues. The\r\ndraft resolution highly encourages the cooperation\r\nbetween BSCE and other regional organizations and\r\ninitiatives.\r\nThe text we have before us was subject to\r\nextensive consultations both here in New York and in\r\nTirana, Albania, during the seventh meeting of the\r\nCouncil of Ministers of Foreign Affairs.\r\nI should like to draw the Assembly’s attention to\r\nthe following minor editorial changes that have been\r\nmade to the document since it was submitted.\r\nIn the second line of paragraph 5, the word\r\n“particularly” has been inserted after the word\r\n“initiatives”.\r\nIn paragraphs 11 and 12, the words “Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization” have been replaced by the words “the\r\nBlack Sea Economic Cooperation Organization”.\r\nThe objectives of BSEC remain clear and\r\nunderstandable: to develop equal partnership, to strive\r\nfor a better life for the peoples of the region and to\r\nachieve stability and prosperity around the Black Sea\r\nthrough regional cooperation in various fields. The\r\nadoption of the draft resolution will undoubtedly\r\nfurther enhance BSEC’s international image.\r\nI should like to conclude by expressing the hope\r\nthat the General Assembly will, as in previous years,\r\ngive its unanimous support to the draft resolution\r\nbefore us.\r\nMr. Ouch (Cambodia): I have the honour, on\r\nbehalf of the 10 States members of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) — Brunei\r\nDarussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines,\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nSingapore, Thailand and Vietnam — to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.16 on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and ASEAN. May I thank all the other\r\nco-sponsors for their support to this draft resolution.\r\nASEAN, which was established on 8 August 1967\r\nin Bangkok, is an expression of the collective will of\r\nthe nations in the region to bind themselves together in\r\nfriendship and cooperation to secure for their peoples\r\nthe blessings of peace, freedom and prosperity. ASEAN\r\nand the United Nations have been development\r\npartners almost from its establishment in 1967, when\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\r\nand ASEAN started their long-standing and productive\r\nrelationship.\r\nOn 29 July 2002, on the occasion of the 35th\r\nASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Brunei Darussalam, the\r\nASEAN Foreign Ministers agreed on the need to\r\nenhance cooperation with the United Nations as a pre-\r\neminent multilateral institution. It is as a follow-up to\r\nthis declaration that we are submitting the draft\r\nresolution calling for closer cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and ASEAN. Such cooperation is vital\r\nto the realization of the basic objectives of ASEAN,\r\nwhich include, among others, accelerating the region’s\r\neconomic growth, social progress and cultural\r\ndevelopment and promoting stability and peace.\r\nIn the light of the many facets of globalization,\r\ncooperation between the two organizations will\r\ncontribute to economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the region so that we could maximize\r\nthe benefits of globalization while reducing its negative\r\neffects, in particular among the region’s least\r\ndeveloped countries, which thus far have not been fully\r\nintegrated into the new realities of a globalized world.\r\nThere is no doubt that ASEAN has contributed to\r\nbuilding a culture of peace and cooperation in the\r\nregion through enhancing habitual cooperation and\r\nmaintaining regional peace, stability and security.\r\nWe have just successfully concluded the eighth\r\nASEAN Summit, held at Phnom Penh, Cambodia,\r\nwhich attracted worldwide attention, followed by the\r\nsixth ASEAN plus Three summit meeting with China,\r\nJapan and the Republic of Korea and a separate\r\nASEAN-India summit. China signed a framework\r\nagreement for a free-trade pact with ASEAN, as well as\r\na Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South\r\nChina Sea. Japan concluded an agreement focusing on\r\nhuman resources and investment, with the possibility\r\nfor a free-trade agreement in the future. And, in a very\r\npositive move, India, at its first summit-level meeting\r\nwith the group, offered to negotiate a free-trade area\r\nwith ASEAN. I am pleased to report that the Summit\r\nalso saw the strengthening of collaboration between\r\nASEAN and Africa, represented by the President of\r\nSouth Africa in his capacity as Chairman of the newly\r\nestablished African Union. He spoke about the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), which\r\nwe fully support. Finally, ASEAN will also strengthen\r\nits cooperation with the Greater Mekong Subregion. On\r\n3 November 2002, Cambodia hosted the first Greater\r\nMekong Subregion Summit, held at Phnom Penh.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, the Phnom Penh\r\nSummit focused on strengthening cooperation to\r\ncombat terrorism in the wake of the heinous terrorist\r\nattacks on 11 September last year and of the attack\r\ncarried out more recently in Bali, which struck at the\r\nheart of ASEAN. It adopted a Declaration on\r\nTerrorism, which expresses ASEAN’s determination to\r\nbuild on measures announced last year in the\r\nDeclaration on Joint Action to Counter Terrorism by\r\nASEAN leaders in Brunei Darussalam to intensify its\r\nefforts to prevent, counter and suppress terrorist\r\nactivities in the region, while urging the international\r\ncommunity to support its efforts. Also last year in\r\nBrunei Darussalam, ASEAN and the United States\r\nsigned a Joint Declaration for Cooperation to Combat\r\nInternational Terrorism.\r\nAt the same time, ASEAN believes that the\r\nUnited Nations is the proper forum for international\r\ncooperation and therefore cooperates, both individually\r\nand collectively, with the United Nations Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee. The ASEAN Regional Forum\r\nand the ASEAN plus Three process are viable and\r\nincreasingly significant forums for peace and stability\r\nin the region.\r\nIn the area of technical cooperation, productive\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) was underscored when the UNDP\r\nwas officially designated an ASEAN Dialogue Partner.\r\nTies between ASEAN and the UNDP were further\r\nstrengthened by the launching of the ASEAN-UNDP\r\nsubregional programmes, aimed at better assisting\r\nASEAN in its regional cooperation and integration\r\nefforts. ASEAN cooperation has evolved over the years\r\nwith such United Nations funds and programmes as the\r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific (ESCAP), the United Nations Conference on\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nTrade and Development and international agencies of\r\nthe United Nations family, in particular the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization; the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization; the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme; the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund; the Joint United Nations Programme on\r\nHIV/AIDS; the World Health Organization; the\r\nInternational Labour Organization; the International\r\nMaritime Organization; and the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency.\r\nFor the reasons that I have cited, we feel that the\r\nresolution under consideration will be beneficial for\r\nboth the United Nations and ASEAN.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Fiji, who, in the course of his\r\nstatement, will introduce draft resolution A/57/L.21.\r\nMr. Naidu (Fiji): Imagine, if you can, a region so\r\ndiverse in its culture, history and geography that its\r\npeople speak some 1,200 languages — a region of\r\nislands large and small, numbering in the thousands\r\nand isolated by vast distances, where pervasive socio-\r\neconomic change and environmental adversity have\r\nhad powerful influences on the way in which its widely\r\ndispersed communities have developed. Picture that\r\nscenario, and then ask yourselves how any of its\r\ninhabitants could possibly attain greater economic and\r\nsocial viability in today’s world. The simple answer is,\r\nof course, through regional cooperation.\r\nThe people of the Pacific have long been guided\r\nby a strong sense of community and are able to interact\r\nwith the world around them by working together and\r\nby sharing resources. Today, we boast an extensive and\r\nhighly effective regional institutional network that\r\nserves us particularly well. It is for that reason that I\r\nam proud and honoured to be addressing this session\r\non regional cooperation on behalf of the members of\r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum. Our diverse members\r\ninclude the metropolitan countries of Australia and\r\nNew Zealand; the Melanesian States of Papua New\r\nGuinea, Fiji, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands, in the\r\nWestern Pacific; the ancient Polynesian cultures of\r\nSamoa and Tonga, in the South Pacific; the remote\r\nmicro-States of Nauru, Tuvalu and Kiribati, in the\r\nCentral Pacific; and the Northern Pacific States of\r\nPalau, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.\r\nToday, our region is intrinsically linked through a\r\nnetwork of organizations. Member States work closely\r\ntogether through our regional organizations on a\r\ndiverse array of issues, ranging from peace and\r\nsecurity to environmental protection, from aviation law\r\nto education, and from information and communication\r\ntechnologies to health. The Pacific Islands Forum\r\nSecretariat, our main policy-making body, oversees a\r\ncentral council of regional organizations of the Pacific\r\nthat includes our regional universities, technical\r\norganizations, development and environmental\r\nagencies and think tanks.\r\nAs the Forum celebrates three decades as the\r\nprincipal multilateral body in the Pacific region, the\r\ndemands of our members and those of the international\r\ncommunity have also increased, thus shaping the\r\ninterventions required by our regional organizations.\r\nThe confidence we have in our organizations is\r\ndemonstrated through the many initiatives and policy\r\ndecisions in various declarations of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum, the most recent being the communiqué of the\r\nthirty-third meeting of Forum leaders, annexed to\r\ndocument A/57/331.\r\nAt present, the Forum enjoys a special\r\nrelationship with the United Nations through its\r\nobserver status in the General Assembly and through\r\nthe strong presence of a number of United Nations\r\nfunds and programmes operating in the region. That\r\nrelationship has matured over recent years and has\r\nbroadened cooperation in new areas such as fisheries,\r\nsmall business enterprise, trade, human rights,\r\ndemocracy, peace-building and oceans management.\r\nWhile we are proud of the fact that the Forum and its\r\nmembership have themselves provided the bulk of\r\nresources for most of the programmes in the region,\r\nwhat the United Nations and its agencies can bring —\r\nindeed, have brought — to the table in terms of\r\ndevelopment cooperation is something that we\r\nrecognize and very much welcome.\r\nAs summarized in the Secretary-General’s report\r\non cooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum,\r\ncontained in document A/57/475, the United Nations\r\nhas provided meaningful assistance in peace-building\r\nthrough consultations and field visits to countries in the\r\nregion and by participation in the Forum Regional\r\nSecurity Committee. Since establishing a United\r\nNations Political Office in Bougainville, it has also\r\ncontributed to peace monitoring efforts and has\r\nprovided electoral assistance in Fiji and the Solomon\r\nIslands.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nOther United Nations agencies have also\r\nestablished a strong presence in the region, with field\r\noffices for the United Nations Development Fund, the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization, the International\r\nLabour Organization, the World Health Organization,\r\nthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the\r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations\r\nEducational, Cultural and Scientific Organization\r\nproviding direct technical and training assistance to the\r\ncountries and the organizations of the Pacific. We urge\r\nthose specialized agencies, along with our bilateral\r\npartners, to continue to work closely with the\r\nSecretary-General to enhance the coordination of\r\nUnited Nations-related activities in the Pacific.\r\nOur members very much appreciate what the\r\nUnited Nations has done for our region. As we begin\r\nthe process of carrying out the Johannesburg Plan of\r\nImplementation, and particularly as we move towards\r\nthe 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction, it is important that those efforts be further\r\nstrengthened and expanded. We, therefore, welcome\r\nthe Secretary-General’s recommendation that\r\nconsultations be undertaken between our organizations\r\nto explore where further cooperation can be gainfully\r\nimplemented.\r\nTo that end, Fiji has the honour to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.21, entitled “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum”.\r\nThrough that draft resolution, we, the members of the\r\nPacific Islands Forum, reaffirm our commitment to a\r\npartnership of cooperation and friendship and offer\r\nsome guidance to the United Nations, as well as to our\r\ninternational partners, on where such cooperation may\r\nindeed be strengthened and expanded.\r\nFinally, in keeping with the theme of cooperation,\r\nI would like to express my group’s sincere gratitude to\r\nthe countries that have joined us in sponsoring the draft\r\nresolution. I am pleased to announce that the following\r\ncountries have also joined as sponsors: Chile, Cuba,\r\nGreece, Israel, Kiribati, Kuwait, Malaysia, the\r\nPhilippines, Sudan and Thailand.\r\nWith these short comments, draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.21 is hereby introduced for consideration by\r\nthe General Assembly, and we look forward to its\r\nadoption on a consensus basis.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of\r\nTurkey, who will introduce draft resolution A/57/L.22.\r\nMr. Cengizer (Turkey): On 12 October 2002, at\r\nthe Twelfth Meeting of the Council of Ministers of the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization (ECO), held in\r\nIstanbul, Turkey assumed the chairmanship of the\r\nECO. It is my country’s honour, in that capacity, to\r\nintroduce today draft resolution A/57/L.22, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization.”\r\nNext week is the tenth anniversary of the\r\nexpansion of ECO. It was on 28 November 1992 that\r\nECO welcomed Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan\r\nas its new members.\r\nThe seventh Summit of ECO, held in Istanbul on\r\n14 October 2002, provided an opportunity to take stock\r\nof the decade-long performance of the expanded\r\norganization. In a time-span of 10 years, the basic\r\ndocuments of ECO were concluded, major agreements\r\nand plans of action were adopted and an impressive\r\nrestructuring process was embarked upon. In 1996, a\r\ncomprehensive economic cooperation strategy was\r\nprepared, according to which transport and\r\ncommunications, trade and investment and energy were\r\noutlined as priority areas for ECO. Today, the\r\ndevelopment and successful implementation of joint\r\nprojects on energy, trade, transportation, agriculture,\r\ndrug control and capacity-building can be cited among\r\nthe leading achievements of ECO.\r\nThe founding document of ECO, the Treaty of\r\nIzmir, envisages the promotion of mutually beneficial\r\ninteraction and cooperation between ECO and other\r\nregional and international organizations, as well as\r\nfinancial institutions. We welcome the report of the\r\nSecretary-General (A/57/119) on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and ECO, wherein the status of that\r\ncooperation is elucidated. We also support the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation in the report that\r\nspecialized agencies, as well as organizations and\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations system and relevant\r\nfinancial institutions, should join in efforts towards the\r\nimplementation of economic programmes and projects\r\nof ECO.\r\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that the\r\nsuccess of the globalization process requires enhanced\r\ncooperation between international organizations and,\r\nespecially, a better division of labour aimed at more\r\nefficient and results-oriented collaboration. Only in\r\nthat manner can regional development be strengthened\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nand our shared commitment to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals achieved. It is with that\r\nunderstanding that we have been encouraging the\r\ndeepening of relations between the ECO and the United\r\nNations system, as well as relations with other relevant\r\ninternational and regional organizations.\r\nThe draft resolution before us today, which is\r\nsponsored by all ECO members, is designed to further\r\npromote the existing cooperation between the United\r\nNations and ECO in the spirit that I tried to describe a\r\nwhile ago.\r\nHaving assumed the chairmanship of ECO for the\r\nnext two years, Turkey is determined to contribute to\r\nthis common endeavour. No doubt, the technical\r\nexperience and financial assistance of international and\r\nregional organizations will bring substantial added value\r\nto the activities of ECO in previously mentioned areas, as\r\nwell as in the important fields of health, environment,\r\nfood security, management, transfer of technology,\r\nrural poverty alleviation and energy efficiency.\r\nAmong the new member States of the\r\norganization, Afghanistan deserves special attention.\r\nTurkey is keen to see that ECO makes a concrete\r\ncontribution to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.\r\nAs a matter of fact, ECO is preparing a plan of action,\r\ntaking due note of the proposals of the member States.\r\nThis plan will be forwarded to the relevant regional\r\nand international organizations so as to raise additional\r\nfunds for proposed reconstruction projects.\r\nECO has the potential to initiate reconstruction\r\nprojects for Afghanistan, modest as they may be,\r\nparticularly in areas where it has accumulated experience.\r\nContributions by Member States to the ECO Fund\r\nwould greatly facilitate efforts in this regard.\r\nTurkey will demonstrate every effort to make\r\nECO a dynamic organization, one that will live up the\r\nexpectations and aspirations of its members. The\r\nSeventh ECO Summit meeting has indeed given\r\nimpetus to efforts geared at increasing the efficiency\r\nand effectiveness of the organization. Further\r\ncooperation with the United Nations will undoubtedly\r\nhelp ECO to reach its goals.\r\nThe President: Before giving the floor to the\r\nnext speaker, the representative of Malta, let me give\r\nthe floor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Perfiliev (Director, General Assembly and\r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs Division of the\r\nDepartment of General Assembly Affairs and\r\nConference Management Services): I should like to\r\ninform Members, with regard to draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.23, that operative paragraph 16, as submitted\r\nby the sponsors, should read as follows:\r\n“Commends the role of the Council of Europe\r\nwith regard to the electoral process in Kosovo,\r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, in preparation for\r\nthe municipal elections on 26 October 2002”.\r\nI should like to inform delegations that draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.23 will be re-issued tomorrow\r\nmorning to reflect this correction.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Malta who, in the course of his\r\nstatement, will introduce draft resolution A/57/L.23.\r\nMr. Balzan (Malta): As Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Malta and the current Chair-in-Office\r\nof the Committee of Ministers of the Council of\r\nEurope, I am deeply honoured and proud to introduce\r\nthis agenda item which, for the third consecutive time,\r\nfeatures on the programme of work of the General\r\nAssembly. I would also like to avail myself of this\r\nopportunity to welcome high officials from the Council\r\nof Europe and delegations from the parliamentary\r\nassembly who have come to New York specifically to\r\nfollow the proceedings of this item in the Assembly.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express my\r\ncountry’s deepest gratitude to the Government of\r\nLuxembourg for having worked indefatigably, under\r\nthe wise and able leadership of Madam Lydie Polfer,\r\nVice-Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, throughout\r\nthe past six months, towards the attainment of the\r\nCouncil of Europe’s tenets and principles and for\r\nhaving striven hard to further the achievement of\r\nEuropean integration.\r\nIt is also my pleasure to announce that, since the\r\ntabling of draft resolution A/57/L.23, the following\r\ncountries have joined the list of sponsors: Belgium,\r\nColombia, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Germany,\r\nGreece, Norway, the Russian Federation, the former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. I would like to thank all\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution for their contributions\r\nand strong support.\r\nSince its inception in 1949, the Council of Europe\r\nhas fully recognized its noble mission to create an\r\norganization that would bring European States into\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\ncloser unity and association. Today, one can overtly\r\nconfirm that the “Pan-Europeanization” dream, as\r\nenshrined in The Hague Congress of 7 May 1948, is\r\nnot far from being accomplished.\r\nThe Council of Europe was founded on a given\r\nbelief, shared by the peoples of post-war Europe, to\r\nactively search for economic prosperity, social progress\r\nand harmony between and among European nations.\r\nThe objectives and ideals of this organization, which\r\nare built on democracy, human rights, fundamental\r\nfreedoms and the rule of law, have developed firmly\r\nthroughout these past five decades. This is the direct\r\nresult of the work of the Council, focusing initially on\r\nthe re-building of Europe, and in recent years, on\r\nbecoming a veritable “pan-European” organization by\r\nexpanding eastwards. In embracing the Central and\r\nEastern European countries within its fold, including\r\nthe Russian Federation, the Council of Europe has\r\nsucceeded in building a greater Europe, without\r\ndividing lines, benefiting people worldwide.\r\nThe Council, which is considered a beacon of\r\nhope and a benchmark for human rights, has grown\r\nfrom a mere 10 member States in 1949 to 23 in 1989.\r\nToday it boasts of 44 member States, representing 800\r\nmillion people. This emerging European architecture\r\nevolved pursuant to the political changes at the end of\r\nthe 1990s, following the fall of the Berlin wall, the\r\ndemise of Communism and the burial of the cold war.\r\nWhen Malta joined the Council of Europe in\r\n1965, Prime Minister Giorgio Borg Olivier declared,\r\n“Membership of the Council of Europe has been for my\r\ncountry like returning home after a long absence”. As\r\nMalta takes up the chairmanship of the Committee of\r\nMinisters for the third time, it notes with satisfaction\r\nthat most of the countries of Europe have today\r\nreturned home.\r\nHowever, in this vein — and here I quote from\r\nthe statement of our Foreign Minister, Dr. Joe Borg,\r\nmade during the Committee of Ministers session on 7\r\nNovember in Strasbourg: “We believe that, in view of\r\nthe political changes within Europe in recent years, it is\r\nessential that the Council of Europe reposition itself\r\nand, in so doing, reassert its value”.\r\nMy country is wholly committed to building\r\nfurther on the recent achievements made by previous\r\nChairmanships. Our ultimate objective is to concentrate\r\nour efforts on two primordial goals.\r\nFirst, aware of the Council’s future role in a fast\r\nemerging European structure, my Government intends\r\nto pursue the process of the political unification of\r\ngreater Europe, on the basis of the cooperation structures\r\nmade available by the Council of Europe, and interact\r\nwith the major partners on the European scene.\r\nSecondly, given that social cohesion is most\r\nimportant in the promotion and protection of\r\nfundamental political rights, we will intensify our\r\nefforts to strengthen further the social and cultural\r\ndimensions of European integration on a continent-\r\nwide scale. In this respect, I would like to underscore\r\nthat only a week ago the Maltese Chairmanship\r\nsuccessfully organized a conference on access to social\r\nrights. Experts on a pan-European level participated in\r\nthis important event to discuss the fundamental\r\nquestions concerning the process of access to social\r\nrights. The conference also gave participants the\r\nopportunity to propose tangible and concrete solutions\r\nto the multiple and often overlapping problems\r\ninhibiting such access.\r\nOne of the major scourges afflicting humankind\r\nin this day and age is international terrorism. The tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001 and other events that\r\nfollowed have clearly placed the brutal realities of\r\nterrorism before the entire world. It is our firm belief\r\nthat the most effective manner to view those heinous\r\nattacks is as part of an unfolding historical process. It\r\nis for this reason that the international community is\r\nduty-bound, compelled and committed to fight against\r\nthat undefined and faceless enemy.\r\nMy Government has openly condemned\r\ninternational terrorism, not only in the Assembly but\r\nalso in many international conferences and forums. We\r\nmaintain that closer and sounder cooperation at the\r\nglobal, regional and bilateral levels is indispensable for\r\nthe successful eradication of modern-day terrorism.\r\nCombating terrorism is our inviolable right.\r\nHenceforth, a strong Europe in a better-organized\r\ninternational community is becoming more and more\r\nvital. In the wake of such uncertainty and instability,\r\nwe must be highly vigilant with regard to this new,\r\nemerging plague, since terrorism destroys life,\r\nannihilates democracy, rejects all legal orders and\r\nnegates human rights. At this juncture, my delegation\r\ncommends the Council’s recent adoption of the\r\nguidelines to help its Member States to safeguard\r\nfundamental values in addressing terrorism. Those\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nguidelines reiterate the responsibility of States to\r\nprotect each human being from acts of terrorism, and,\r\ntherefore, to recognize that the struggle against terrorism\r\nmay require the adoption of specific measures, while at\r\nthe same time outlining the limits that States shall\r\nimpose upon themselves in this respect.\r\nMy Government remains firm in its unwavering\r\nand steadfast commitment to this fight, which\r\ncontinues to be ever more imperative, especially within\r\nthe context of the negative impact of terrorist activities\r\non the lives of ordinary and innocent people. We must\r\nform a common front to fight this scourge while\r\nsimultaneously finding ways and means of dealing with\r\nits root causes.\r\nIn this connection, allow me to praise the Council\r\nof Europe for having assumed its full responsibilities in\r\nthe fight against global terrorism by working in tandem\r\nwith the United Nations on various fronts, most notably\r\nin the sphere of legal cooperation, the protection of\r\nfundamental rights and in the promotion of\r\nintercultural and interreligious dialogue.\r\nSynonymous with humane values, the Council of\r\nEurope, in conformity with the provisions of Protocol\r\nNo. 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights,\r\nprohibits recourse to the death penalty in peacetime.\r\nOne notes with satisfaction that the Council has put the\r\nabolition of the death penalty high on its agenda, and in\r\nthis regard, one is pleased to report that no execution\r\nhas taken place in the Council’s member States since\r\n1997. With Protocol No. 13, which was opened for\r\nsignature on 3 May 2002 in Vilnius, the scope of Protocol\r\nNo. 6 was extended even further as it opened the way for\r\nabolishing capital punishment in all circumstances.\r\nWithin the context of globalization, it is\r\nbecoming more and more important for the United\r\nNations and the Council of Europe to promulgate\r\ncooperation by exchanging information and by seeking\r\nfurther coordination in their work, while at the same\r\ntime encouraging the streamlining of activities with the\r\naim of ensuring the proper utilization of resources.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe dates back to 1951. However, one\r\nmust not be oblivious to the accelerated and steady\r\npace with which these two organizations have, in\r\nrecent years, moved forward together. Testimony of\r\nthis cooperation is well documented in the\r\ncomprehensive report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/57/225). Suffice it to mention the involvement of\r\nboth the Council of Europe and the United Nations in\r\nthe process of conflict-prevention, post-conflict\r\nrehabilitation and peace-building in South Eastern\r\nEurope, most particularly, in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia — Serbia and\r\nMontenegro — and, further afield, in Georgia. At this\r\nstage, I would also like to add that the active\r\ncontribution of the Council of Europe concerning the\r\nelectoral process in Kosovo in preparation for the\r\nrecent municipal elections has also been remarkable.\r\nIn view of the above, I would like to mention the\r\nfruitful contribution of the Council of Europe to the\r\nInternational Conference on Human Rights and\r\nDemocratization in Europe, Central Asia and the\r\nCaucasus, which was held in Dubrovnik, Croatia,\r\ntowards the end of last year. The Conference was co-\r\norganized by the Office of the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In the\r\nConference, the Government of Croatia and the\r\nEuropean Commission offered Governments, regional\r\norganizations, national institutions and representatives\r\nof civil society the possibility of reviewing\r\ndevelopments in the field of human rights in Europe,\r\nCentral Asia and the Caucasus.\r\nLet me underscore that we are living today in an\r\nera which is indeed as interesting as it is difficult. The\r\nchallenges, old and new, that lie ahead are enormous,\r\nyet not totally insurmountable. Having said that, I\r\nwould consider it propitious for the General Assembly\r\nto call upon the Secretary-General to explore every\r\navenue to further consolidate the already sound ties\r\nthat exist between the United Nations and the Council\r\nof Europe in order to meet these challenges.\r\nIn conclusion, may I appeal to all Member States\r\nof the Assembly to support the level of cooperation\r\nexisting between the two bodies and contribute to its\r\nfurther enhancement.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative\r\nof Uruguay, who in the course of his statement will\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/57/L.24.\r\nMr. Paolillo (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe honour of speaking on behalf of the Group of Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean States to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.24 entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem”. This draft resolution, which updates\r\nresolution 56/98 adopted by consensus by the General\r\nAssembly on 14 December 2001, is based on the most\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nrecent report of the Secretary-General on this subject,\r\nwhich is contained in document A/57/128.\r\nWe are grateful to the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport, which clearly demonstrates that, since the\r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the Latin\r\nAmerican Economic System (SELA) on 27 December\r\n1991, cooperation between them has evolved and\r\nexpanded in a way that is very satisfactory and\r\nproductive for both entities. In this connection, we\r\nwould like to point out that the Summary section of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/57/128) states:\r\n“Such cooperation has evolved over the\r\nyears and has become more diversified in terms\r\nof both the areas of cooperation and the\r\norganizations concerned”.\r\nThe diversification referred to in the report\r\ndemonstrates that regional affairs, both economic and\r\nsocial, are closely interlinked, and that in providing an\r\nimpetus for greater cooperation and integration among\r\nthe countries of the region — one of the principal\r\nobjectives of SELA — coordination is required with\r\nregard to issues that are increasingly complex and\r\ndiverse. That is why it is essential to strengthen and\r\nexpand channels of cooperation between our universal\r\nOrganization and the regional system with a view to\r\nachieving a greater exchange of information and\r\nexperience with regard to public policy and the\r\nformulation and implementation of projects.\r\nThe idea of strengthening cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and SELA is referred to in the\r\npreambular part of the draft resolution and is stated\r\nagain in the operative part, where references are made\r\nto some of the specialized agencies, organizations,\r\nfunds and programmes of the United Nations that have\r\nsuccessfully carried out cooperative programmes with\r\nSELA. They are invited to continue and to deepen that\r\ncooperation. But such a process is not an end in itself;\r\nit must be directed at identifying the best way to\r\nimprove our ability to attract resources, bring about\r\ngreater coordination and make better use of technical\r\ncooperation, with the goal of contributing — in the\r\nwords of paragraph 4 of the draft resolution — “to joint\r\nactions to achieve the Millennium goals”.\r\nIn view of the positive developments in the\r\ncooperation that exists between the United Nations and\r\nSELA and given that we will continue to work along\r\nthese lines, the draft resolution reiterates its request to\r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations and the\r\nPermanent Secretary of the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem, to assess, at the appropriate time, the\r\nimplementation of the Agreement between the two\r\nentities, and to report thereon to the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-ninth session. Finally, the draft resolution\r\nrequests the Secretary-General to submit to the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-ninth session a report on the\r\nimplementation of the draft resolution.\r\nThe members of the Group of Latin American\r\nand Caribbean States hope that, as in the past when\r\nsimilar drafts were presented, draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.24 will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of the\r\nCongo, who in the course of his statement will\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/57/L.25.\r\nMr. Ikouebe (Congo) (spoke in French): I have\r\nthe honour of speaking on behalf of the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States — Angola,\r\nBurundi, Cameroon, the Congo, Gabon, Equatorial\r\nGuinea, the Central African Republic, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe and Chad — all of which have sponsored draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.25, which is currently the subject of\r\nbroad consultations. Any revisions that might be made\r\nto it will be communicated to you, Mr. President,\r\nbefore the end of the debate.\r\nAbout two years ago — on 10 November 2000\r\nand on 12 December 2000 — the General Assembly\r\nadopted resolutions 55/22 and 55/161, respectively, on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nEconomic Community of Central African States.\r\nThrough those resolutions, the United Nations sought\r\nto support the efforts and initiatives of the Central\r\nAfrican States in meeting the challenges facing them,\r\nin particular those relating to crises, armed conflict,\r\nreconstruction and development.\r\nThis year the draft resolution has been drawn up\r\nwithin a new context, and thus has a special character.\r\nFirst of all, on 22 October 2002, the Security Council,\r\nat the initiative of the then President, Mr. Martin\r\nBelinga-Eboutou, the Permanent Representative of\r\nCameroon, convened a public meeting on strengthening\r\ncooperation between the United Nations system and the\r\nCentral African region in the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity. During that meeting a very constructive\r\nexchange of views took place between the States of\r\nCentral Africa and their bilateral and multilateral\r\npartners on the situation in the region with regard to\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\npeace, security and economic integration. The\r\nrepresentatives of the Central African States and the\r\nmembers of the Security Council also discussed ways\r\nand means of strengthening existing partnerships\r\nbetween the United Nations system and the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States. Most speakers\r\nsaid that economic reconstruction, the strengthening of\r\nhuman and institutional capacities and the promotion of\r\nthe rule of law were crucial elements for peace-\r\nbuilding in Central Africa. Likewise, several members\r\nof the Council recommended that special attention be\r\ngiven to the development of the subregion, particularly\r\nwith regard to making the international community\r\naware of the need for immediate action to stabilize the\r\nsituation in that particularly sensitive area.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity thank our\r\nbilateral and multilateral partners for having reiterated,\r\nduring the course of that debate, their interest in and\r\ncommitment to helping Central Africa to strengthen its\r\ncapacities in maintaining peace, security and\r\nreconstruction.\r\nThe statement by the President of the Council of\r\n31 October 2002, following the public meeting of 22\r\nOctober, now serves as a reference text for relations\r\nbetween the United Nations and Central Africa. The\r\ndraft resolution before the Assembly stresses how\r\ncrucial that is.\r\nSecondly, I would like to refer to the regional\r\ndevelopment effort undertaken by Africa in elaborating\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), which places Central Africa in a key\r\nposition with regard to the development of the\r\ncontinent and provides the region with an opportunity\r\nto develop its enormous potential.\r\nThis new challenge is huge, just as our region is\r\nhuge — a point made so well by the Gabonese Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Jean Ping:\r\n“Central Africa is evolving at the pace of a two-\r\nfold destiny. First of all, the destiny of\r\nabundance, characterized by a sort of divine\r\nprovidence that has bestowed upon our immense\r\nsubregion vast natural resources — diamonds,\r\nleather, manganese, oil, and rich forests —\r\nnecessary not only for its own development but\r\nalso for that of the rest of the world.”\r\n(S/PV.4630, p.16)\r\nToday, with the gradual return of peace to most\r\ncountries of the subregion, Central Africa, now more\r\nthan ever before, has to try to live up to its enormous\r\npotential and to play a major role in the international\r\narena.\r\nAs everyone knows, Central Africa has for\r\nseveral years been facing a serious situation of armed\r\nconflicts, destabilization, insecurity and, consequently,\r\nimpoverishment. But, finally, there are some glimmers\r\nof hope on the horizon. Witness the political will of\r\nheads of State concerned, who are seriously concerned\r\nby the worsening situation and have given new impetus\r\nto the development of the region by taking initiatives to\r\nmeet these challenges and by becoming personally\r\ninvolved in the quest for negotiated solutions. Witness\r\nthe Libreville Summit on the crisis between the Central\r\nAfrican Republic and Chad. Witness also the goodwill\r\nof parties to the conflict and the growing awareness of\r\nmost actors, who finally want to give peace,\r\nreconstruction and development a chance. I refer also\r\nto the tireless support given by the international\r\ncommunity, which has constantly accompanied the\r\nefforts of the subregion, as shown by the presence in\r\nCentral Africa of 6 out of the total 16 Special\r\nRepresentatives and Special Envoys of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the African continent.\r\nAn assessment of the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and ECCAS, even if it has not lived up\r\nto all of our expectations, nevertheless gives us reason\r\nfor hope. The report submitted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Economic Community of Central\r\nAfrican States” (A/57/266), reinforces this impression.\r\nThis cooperation has been reflected in many initiatives\r\nto implement confidence-building measures, security\r\nand development in the region.\r\nSuffice it to recall the efforts made by the United\r\nNations in the framework of the work done by the\r\nUnited Nations Standing Advisory Committee on\r\nSecurity Questions in Central Africa, the creation of\r\nwhich is part of this political determination to establish\r\na subregional mechanism for preventive diplomacy and\r\ncollective security, and which is a special forum for\r\neffective cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Central African States in a very sensitive area.\r\nSeveral mechanisms for conflict prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution are being developed, and\r\nthe many recommendations and decisions adopted\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nreinforce the image of a geopolitical space that is in the\r\nprocess of normalization. The efforts of the countries\r\nof the region are also shown through many actions to\r\nreinforce human rights, democracy and good\r\ngovernance.\r\nIn addition to these initiatives, we have given\r\nnew momentum to subregional integration by reviving\r\nthe functioning of ECCAS itself, whose powers since\r\n1999 have been extended to peace and security and by\r\nre-launching, within the context of the Economic and\r\nMonetary Community of Central African States, joint\r\nprogrammes for economic and social development.\r\nA lot remains to be done; the situation remains\r\nfragile. That is why we stress the urgent need for\r\nconcrete measures to reinforce these various peace\r\nprocesses. This is also why we welcome the\r\nrecommendation contained in the Statement by the\r\nPresident of the Security Council, dated 31 October\r\n2002, for\r\n“the inclusion, where appropriate, of support for\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration in\r\nthe mandates of peacekeeping and peace-building\r\noperations”. (S/PRST/2002/31, p.3)\r\nThis is key, because, whether we are talking\r\nabout the Lusaka, Sun City or Pretoria Agreements on\r\nthe conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nin Angola or in Burundi, or the Libreville\r\nAgreements — just to refer to these instruments — the\r\ncontinuation and stepping up of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and ECCAS remain decisive for our\r\nefforts to bring about stability in the subregion and to\r\npromote its development.\r\nDraft resolution A/57/L.25 meets these concerns.\r\nIt reiterates the texts adopted in 2000 and 2001 and\r\nstresses the conclusions reached at the public meeting\r\nof the Security Council on 22 October 2002, which was\r\na milestone. We cannot over-emphasize the urgent\r\nimportance, in a context marked by the need for post-\r\nconflict peace-building, of supporting the process of\r\nconflict prevention and settlement, as well as the\r\nimplementation of disarmament, demobilization and\r\nreintegration programmes.\r\nAccordingly, the countries of the subregion\r\nreiterate their commitment to strengthen all existing\r\nmechanisms available for preventive diplomacy and\r\ncollective security in order to ensure that the whole\r\nsubregion enjoys social and economic development\r\ncommensurate with its enormous assets.\r\nIn order to attain these two goals, peace and\r\ndevelopment, the Central African States place real\r\nhopes on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe ECCAS.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Jamaica who, in the course of his\r\nstatement, will introduce draft resolution A/57/L.26.\r\nMr. Neil (Jamaica): I have the honour to\r\nintroduce, for the consideration of the General\r\nAssembly, the draft resolution entitled, “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Caribbean\r\nCommunity”, which is before the Assembly as\r\ndocument A/57/L.26. I do so on behalf of the following\r\nsponsors: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados,\r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, St. Kitts\r\nand Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,\r\nSuriname, Trinidad and Tobago and my own country,\r\nJamaica.\r\nActivities pertaining to cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) have been dealt with in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General in document A/57/254 prepared\r\npursuant to paragraph 8 of resolution 55/17 of 7\r\nNovember 2000. The report outlines various aspects of\r\ncooperation between the secretariats of the United\r\nNations and CARICOM, which involves an active\r\nprocess of consultation and exchange of information.\r\nThis cooperation has been growing in areas\r\ncritical to the economic and social development of the\r\nCaribbean subregion including disaster preparedness\r\nand risk reduction, follow-up action, in relation to\r\nmajor international conferences, drug control, health,\r\nthe environment and marine affairs.\r\nCooperation has been strengthened through the\r\ninvolvement of various United Nations bodies and\r\nagencies, including the Economic Commission for\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), the United\r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\r\n(UNCTAD), the United Nations International Drug\r\nControl Programme (UNDCP), the Joint United\r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United\r\nNations (FAO) and the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIn its preambular section, the draft resolution\r\nbefore the Assembly reaffirms the importance of\r\nregional organizations in furthering the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security, within the context of Chapter VIII\r\nof the Charter. It also notes the fruitful results of\r\nmeetings held between representatives of the United\r\nNations and the Caribbean Community. It draws\r\nattention to two initiatives of particular interest to\r\nCaribbean Community: first, the importance of the\r\nadoption of an integrated management approach to the\r\nCaribbean Sea in the context of sustainable\r\ndevelopment and, secondly, the necessity for the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\non Small Island Developing States. It notes relevant\r\nproposals emanating from recent international\r\nconferences, in particular the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, and\r\nthe United Nations special session on HIV/AIDS, in\r\nwhich special recognition was given to the situation in\r\nthe Caribbean region. It also reaffirms the need to\r\nstrengthen existing cooperation in the areas of\r\neconomic and social development, as well as in\r\npolitical and humanitarian affairs.\r\nIn its operative section, the draft resolution takes\r\nnote of the report of the Secretary-General on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCaribbean Community, as well as of efforts to\r\nstrengthen that cooperation. It calls upon the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in association with the Secretary-General of\r\nCARICOM, to continue to assist in furthering the\r\ndevelopment and maintenance of peace and security\r\nwithin the Caribbean. It urges specialized agencies and\r\nother organizations and programmes of the United\r\nNations system to cooperate in order to initiate,\r\nmaintain and increase consultations and programmes\r\nwith the Caribbean Community and its associated\r\ninstitutions in the attainment of their objectives, giving\r\nspecial attention to the areas and issues identified at the\r\nsecond general meeting, held in March 2000. The draft\r\nresolution also welcomes the initiatives of Member\r\nStates to assist the cooperation between the two\r\nsecretariats, and recommends that a third meeting\r\nbetween representatives of the two organizations be\r\nheld in New York in March 2003, in order to review\r\nand appraise progress in the implementation of the\r\nagreed areas and issues and to hold consultations on\r\nsuch additional measures and procedures as may be\r\nrequired to facilitate and strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations. Finally, it requests a\r\nreport by the Secretary-General to the General\r\nAssembly during the fifty-ninth session and the\r\ninclusion in the provisional agenda of that session of an\r\nitem on the subject for its consideration.\r\nI should like to announce that since the\r\npublication of the draft resolution, the following\r\ncountries have become sponsors: Canada, Chile, Cuba,\r\nEcuador and Japan.\r\nThe contents of the draft resolution basically seek\r\nto further develop the process of cooperation and\r\ncollaboration between the United Nations system and\r\nthe Caribbean Community. Its provisions, we believe,\r\nwill receive wide support within the Assembly. It is the\r\nhope of the sponsors that, as in previous years, this\r\ndraft resolution can be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Sudan to introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.28.\r\nMr. Erwa (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is a\r\npleasure and an honour to submit to the Assembly the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/57/L.28,\r\nwhich is sponsored by Algeria, Gambia, Mali,\r\nMalaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sudan,\r\nSyria and Turkey. I will read out additional sponsors\r\nlater on.\r\nThe draft resolution relates to agenda item 22,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations”, and specifically to\r\nsub-item (o), entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference”.\r\nAt the outset, we would like to commend the\r\nannual report submitted by the Secretary-General in\r\ndocument A/57/405, in which the Secretary-General\r\ngives a detailed accounting of the consultations that\r\nhave taken place in the course of the year between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference in the political, economic, social,\r\nhumanitarian and other spheres.\r\nIn its preambular part, the draft resolution recalls\r\nresolution 3369 (XXX), of 10 October 1975, by which\r\nthe General Assembly decided to invite the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference to participate\r\nas an observer in the work of the General Assembly\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nand its subsidiary bodies. The draft resolution also\r\nwelcomes the results of the meetings held at Vienna\r\nfrom 11 to 13 July 2002 between the agencies and\r\nbodies of the United Nations and those of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference.\r\nIn its operative part, the draft resolution deals\r\nwith the following salient issues. First, the draft\r\nresolution notes with satisfaction the active\r\nparticipation of the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference in the activities of the United Nations in\r\nrealizing the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nSecondly, the draft resolution welcomes the\r\nefforts made by the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference to promote\r\ncooperation between the two organizations in areas of\r\ncommon interest and to consider ways and means of\r\nenhancing the actual mechanisms of that cooperation.\r\nThirdly, the draft resolution welcomes the\r\nperiodic high-level meetings held between the\r\nSecretaries-General of the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, and\r\nencourages their joint participation in the important\r\nmeetings held by both organizations.\r\nFourthly, the draft resolution urges the entire\r\nUnited Nations system, and especially donor agencies,\r\nto increase their technical and other support to the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference and its\r\nsubsidiary bodies and specialized and associated\r\nagencies to enhance and strengthen cooperation.\r\nFifthly, the draft resolution expresses\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations for his continued efforts to strengthen\r\ncooperation and coordination between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference in the political, economic, social, cultural\r\nand scientific spheres.\r\nSixthly, the draft resolution calls on the\r\nSecretary-General to submit to the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-ninth session a report on the state of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference. It also calls\r\nfor the inclusion of an agenda item entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference” in the\r\nprovisional agenda of the Assembly’s fifty-ninth\r\nsession.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on the representative of Lebanon to introduce draft\r\nresolutions A/57/L.29 and A/57/L.32.\r\nMr. Diab (Lebanon) (spoke in French): At the\r\noutset, allow me to associate myself with previous\r\nspeakers in conveying profound gratitude to the\r\nSecretary-General for the high quality and precision of\r\nhis report entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie”.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the\r\nGovernment of Senegal on the election of Mr. Abdou\r\nDiouf to the post of Secretary-General of the\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie (OIF) at\r\nthe ninth summit, held at Beirut in October. We assure\r\nhim of our full support as he undertakes his important\r\nduties. I also thank his predecessor, Mr. Boutros\r\nBoutros-Ghali, for his work in office to promote the\r\nrole of OIF and to develop its relations with the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is a great honour for me to introduce, on behalf\r\nof the 68 sponsors, the draft resolution on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the International\r\nOrganization of la Francophonie, contained in\r\ndocument A/57/L.29. Turkey and San Marino have\r\njoined the list of sponsors of the draft resolution.\r\nThe current draft resolution is an update of\r\nresolution 56/45 and deals with the same subject. It\r\nincludes a preambular part consisting of 10 paragraphs,\r\nwhich is the draft resolution’s legal basis for the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and OIF in\r\npromoting the purposes and principles of the\r\nOrganization. The preambular part addresses in\r\nparticular the crucial commitments adopted in the\r\nBeirut plan of action by the heads of State and\r\nGovernment of countries that use French as a common\r\nlanguage. Those commitments are the guidelines for\r\naction in which Francophonie can and must play a\r\nmajor role in the fight against poverty and the\r\nestablishment of a more equitable globalization that is\r\nconducive to progress, peace, democracy and human\r\nrights and is respectful of cultural and linguistic\r\ndiversity to the benefit of the most vulnerable people\r\nand for the development of all countries.\r\nThe operative part of the draft resolution consists\r\nof 17 paragraphs that identify previous international\r\nand regional attempts and subsequent steps to\r\nconsolidate, develop and strengthen existing links\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nbetween the United Nations and OIF in the political,\r\neconomic, social and cultural areas.\r\nThe operative part stresses the increasingly close\r\nand fruitful cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand OIF. The Secretary-General’s report indicates\r\nprogress made in the number and quality of cooperative\r\nactivities cited in the operative part of the draft\r\nresolution and jointly conducted by both organizations.\r\nThis cooperation has several aspects, including\r\npolitical cooperation within the secretariats;\r\ncooperation in the economic, social and cultural fields;\r\nand cooperation with the United Nations funds,\r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies through\r\nparticipation in conferences organized under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations system and OIF. Such\r\ncooperation is designed to pool efforts in the areas of\r\npreventive diplomacy, the promotion of democracy,\r\npeacemaking, peace-building, the promotion of human\r\nrights and of economic, social and cultural\r\ndevelopment, and participation in strengthening the\r\ndialogue between cultures and civilizations.\r\nLebanon keenly hopes that cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and OIF will be strengthened and\r\nextended to a growing and more diversified number of\r\nfields. That is why my delegation calls on the General\r\nAssembly to give its full support to the draft resolution.\r\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to stress the\r\nimportance of the solidarity expressed in favour of the\r\nArabic language and culture at the most recent OIF\r\nsummit — held for the first time in an Arab country,\r\nLebanon — by the heads of State and Government of\r\ncountries that use French as a common language. The\r\nsummit offered the heads of State and Government an\r\nopportunity to support, through the Beirut Declaration,\r\nthe Arab peace initiative unanimously adopted at the\r\nArab summit held in Beirut in March.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nOn behalf of the delegations of Arab members of\r\nthe League of Arab States, and in Lebanon’s capacity\r\nas Chairman of the Group of Arab States at the United\r\nNations for this month, I have the honour to submit the\r\ndraft resolution contained in document A/57/L.32,\r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe League of Arab States”.\r\nThe current links between the United Nations and\r\nthe League of Arab States reflect the cooperation and\r\nintegration envisioned under Chapter VIII of the\r\nCharter of the United Nations. The relationship\r\nbetween the two organizations is built on firm\r\nfoundations, as enshrined in the purposes and\r\nprinciples of their two charters. This relationship has\r\nevolved over the years in many areas, including the\r\npromotion of international peace and security,\r\ndecolonization, disarmament and economic, social and\r\ncultural development.\r\nThe new international political realities of today’s\r\nworld are undergoing enormous changes that affect\r\nregional and international relations. These new realities\r\nhave led to increased responsibilities for the United\r\nNations in its efforts to find solutions to problems\r\naffecting world peace and security. The League of Arab\r\nStates has been eager to cooperate with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations in order to strengthen\r\nthe Organization’s role in establishing peace on the\r\nbasis of justice and United Nations resolutions,\r\nespecially in our Arab region. In this regard, the\r\npresence of the Secretary-General of the United\r\nNations at the League of Arab States Summit held in\r\nBeirut last March reflected that cooperation and helped\r\nto increase international support for the Arab peace\r\ninitiative adopted at the Beirut Summit and welcomed\r\nby the Security Council in its resolutions 1397 (2002)\r\nand 1435 (2002).\r\nWe consider that, in view of current events in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories, it is necessary to\r\nintensify that cooperation and to ensure a greater\r\nUnited Nations contribution to ending Israel’s\r\noccupation of Arab territories and the Israeli occupying\r\nforces’ continued aggression against the Palestinian\r\npeople.\r\nIn the same context, there is a pressing need to\r\nenhance cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe League of Arab States in economic, social and\r\ndevelopmental areas. This would accelerate the pace of\r\ndevelopment in the Arab world and fulfil the common\r\ngoals of the two organizations.\r\nThere are many examples of practical cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations, which is an international\r\norganization, and the League of Arab States, which is a\r\nregional organization, in the areas of conflict\r\nprevention and peace-building. In this regard, we\r\nwould like to refer to the appeal launched by the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the States\r\nmembers of the League of Arab States that resulted in\r\nthe letter addressed by the Iraqi Foreign Minister to the\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations on 16\r\nSeptember 2002 (S/2002/1034, annex). That letter\r\nstated Iraq’s response to the international will and its\r\nagreement to the return of the international weapons\r\ninspectors without restrictions or conditions. Iraq’s\r\nresponse represented a first step towards a\r\ncomprehensive solution that would ensure the\r\nimplementation of the remaining Security Council\r\nresolutions and would bring about, inter alia, the lifting\r\nof sanctions; respect for Iraq’s sovereignty,\r\nindependence and territorial integrity; and the\r\nconversion of the Middle East into a region free of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. In the report before the\r\nAssembly (A/57/386), the Secretary-General highlights\r\nthe role of the League of Arab States in facilitating\r\nIraq’s agreement to return documents belonging to the\r\nKuwaiti archives.\r\nThe preamble of draft resolution A/57/L.32\r\nunderscores the desire of the two organizations to\r\nfurther consolidate existing ties in all areas and to\r\ncontinue their cooperation in order to enhance their\r\ncommon goals and to promote the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. The\r\noperative part takes note with satisfaction of the\r\nSecretary-General’s report, and expresses its\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the follow-up\r\naction taken by him to implement the proposals\r\nadopted at the meetings between the secretariats of the\r\nUnited Nations and other organizations of the United\r\nNations system and the General Secretariat of the\r\nLeague of Arab States and its specialized\r\norganizations, including the sectoral meeting on the use\r\nof information technology in development held at the\r\nheadquarters of the League of Arab States in Cairo,\r\nfrom 18 to 20 June 2002.\r\nAlso, the operative part calls for intensified\r\ncooperation in the political, economic, social,\r\nhumanitarian, cultural and administrative fields. In line\r\nwith that approach, paragraph 10 recommends that\r\nrepresentatives from both organizations meet every two\r\nyears and that joint inter-agency sectoral meetings\r\nshould also be convened on a biennial basis to address\r\npriority areas of major importance to the development\r\nof the Arab States.\r\nFinally, on behalf of the Arab Group, I wish to\r\ninvite the General Assembly, which represents the\r\ninternational community, to support cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab\r\nStates. Our group hopes that the draft resolution before\r\nus will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the representative of Angola, who, in\r\nthe course of her statement, will introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.30.\r\nMs. Izata (Angola): I have the honour to\r\nintroduce draft resolution A/57/L.30, on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) on behalf of SADC\r\nmember countries, which include Botswana, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Malawi,\r\nMauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles,\r\nSwaziland, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nand my own country, Angola. The Secretary-General’s\r\nreport, document A/57/94, indicates that the United\r\nNations stands ready to increase its cooperation with\r\nthe Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC) in areas that can promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment and regional integration. The draft\r\nresolution strongly emphasizes the need for United\r\nNations bodies, the international community, the\r\nprivate sector and civil society to continue to assist and\r\nparticipate in the development of the Southern African\r\nregion.\r\nThe purpose of the draft resolution is to\r\nstrengthen and increase cooperation and support\r\nbetween the United Nations and countries in the region,\r\nparticularly in areas of major concern to the region,\r\nsuch as the consolidation and maintenance of\r\ndemocracy, peace and security, peace-building and\r\nsustainable development. The draft resolution has been\r\nupdated to incorporate recent developments,\r\nparticularly the adoption of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), the movement\r\ntowards peace in Angola and the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo and the humanitarian situation in\r\nSouthern Africa. The continued high prevalence in the\r\nregion of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases,\r\nsuch as malaria and tuberculosis, has also influenced\r\nthe content of the draft resolution.\r\nIn its preambular part, the draft resolution, having\r\nrecalled all General Assembly resolutions and\r\ndecisions on the promotion of cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and SADC, welcomes the adoption of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development by the\r\nAfrican Union and its endorsement by the Assembly.\r\nThe preambular part of the draft resolution also\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nexpresses concern about the difficult humanitarian\r\nsituation facing the countries in the region and\r\nexpresses its appreciation for valuable and effective\r\nsupport demonstrated by the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community. Furthermore, in its operative\r\npart, the draft resolution calls upon the United Nations\r\nand the international community to support with\r\nappropriate resources SADC’s efforts to implement the\r\noutcomes of the Millennium Assembly and other major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits. It appeals to\r\nthe international community to continue to support the\r\nmeasures taken by SADC in addressing HIV/AIDS and\r\nto extend much-needed assistance to SADC countries\r\nthat are engaged in the process of national\r\nreconstruction, sound economic policies, good\r\ngovernance and the rule of law to enhance the\r\nimplementation of their national economic\r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe draft resolution also expresses its support to\r\nthe economic reforms being implemented by SADC\r\nmember States in pursuance of their shared vision of\r\ncreating a regional economic community through\r\ndeeper integration, and calls upon the international\r\ncommunity to support their efforts in capacity-building\r\nand in addressing the new challenges presented to the\r\neconomies of the region arising from the process of\r\nglobalization and liberalization.\r\nFinally, in paragraph 21, the Secretary-General is\r\nrequested to submit a report on the implementation of\r\nthe draft resolution to the fifty-ninth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nBesides members of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community, countries that have joined\r\nthe list of sponsors include Gabon, Morocco, the Sudan\r\nand Uganda. I take this opportunity to thank all the\r\ndelegations that provided their support during the\r\nelaboration of this draft resolution — namely, those of\r\nBrazil, Mexico, Morocco, the Russian Federation,\r\nThailand and the United States, as well as the European\r\nUnion. It is my wish that the draft resolution be\r\nadopted by consensus. We would also welcome the\r\ninclusion of other countries that wish to join the list of\r\nsponsors.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the representative of the Netherlands,\r\nwho, in the course of his statement, will introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.31.\r\nMr. Hamburger (Netherlands): I will be brief.\r\nFirst of all, I should like to thank Mr. Rogelio Pfirter,\r\nDirector-General of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), for\r\npresenting the report of the OPCW.\r\nSecondly, my delegation has the pleasure to\r\nintroduce, on behalf of the sponsors, the draft\r\nresolution regarding cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization for the Prohibition of\r\nChemical Weapons, as contained in document\r\nA/57/L.31. I should like to inform the Assembly that\r\nthe following countries have joined the list of sponsors:\r\nBelgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, the Dominican\r\nRepublic, Germany, Monaco, the Philippines, the\r\nRepublic of Korea, Slovenia, Thailand, the United\r\nKingdom and Yugoslavia. This procedural draft\r\nresolution, once adopted, will enable the General\r\nAssembly to include in the agenda of its fifty-ninth\r\nsession an item entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons”.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank all\r\nthose countries that have sponsored this draft\r\nresolution, and I warmly recommend that the draft\r\nresolution be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the representative of Chile, who, in the\r\ncourse of his statement, will introduce draft resolution\r\nA/57/L.38.\r\nMr. Valdés (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I have the\r\nhonour to introduce to the General Assembly the draft\r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union, contained in\r\ndocument A/57/L.38. I should like to add the following\r\ncountries to the list of sponsors: Armenia, Australia,\r\nBangladesh, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nBulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, the\r\nCentral African Republic, Colombia, Costa Rica, the\r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia,\r\nEthiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Germany, Guinea, Iceland,\r\nIndonesia, Iraq, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,\r\nthe Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, the\r\nNetherlands, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Slovenia,\r\nSpain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, the former Yugoslav Republic\r\nof Macedonia, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Uzbekistan and\r\nViet Nam.\r\nThe draft resolution that I have the honour to\r\nintroduce is of great importance for the Organization. It\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nrepresents the culmination of several years of joint\r\nwork by the United Nations, its Member States and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union to add a parliamentary\r\ndimension to the structure of multilateral cooperation.\r\nThe scope and the quality of that cooperation are\r\ndetailed in the report of the Secretary-General on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, contained in document A/57/375.\r\nOur world is experiencing an era of great changes\r\nthat entail an important evolution in international\r\nrelations. That in turn requires our peoples and\r\nmultilateral organizations to work more closely\r\ntogether. It also gives rise to the need for national\r\nparliaments to contribute to international cooperation.\r\nIt is national parliaments that have the constitutional\r\nduty to represent their peoples. In addition, they have\r\nan important role in transforming United Nations\r\nagreements into national policies. That is why, in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, our heads of State or\r\nGovernment resolved to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and national parliaments\r\nthrough their world organization, the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union brings together\r\nmore than 140 parliaments of the world and can be a\r\nchannel for cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand national parliaments. For this new type of\r\ncooperation to be effective, we have recognized the\r\nneed to change the Statutes of the world organization\r\nof parliaments. At our request, the IPU Secretary\r\nGeneral prepared a report last year in which he made a\r\nseries of recommendations as to the contents of new\r\nStatutes.\r\nThe draft resolution that I have the honour to\r\nintroduce is the result of broad consultations among\r\nMember States on the basis of the Secretary-General’s\r\nrecommendations. Accordingly, the draft resolution\r\ntakes up, first of all, a very important development\r\nwith respect to the Inter-Parliamentary Union that has\r\nlong been an aspiration of many Member States: the\r\ngranting of United Nations observer status to the\r\nUnion. That recognition is bestowed by virtue of the\r\nUnion’s unique character as an inter-State organization\r\nwhose essential functions are focused on inter-\r\nparliamentary activity. In consideration of that aspect,\r\nthe draft resolution authorizes the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion to circulate its official documents at no cost to\r\nthe organization.\r\nIn turn, the draft resolution invites the specialized\r\nagencies of the United Nations system to consider\r\nadopting similar modalities with respect to the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. It calls upon the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to adopt the necessary measures to strengthen\r\nthe cooperation and the relationship between the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union and the General Assembly.\r\nFinally, the draft resolution places this item on the\r\nagenda of the fifty-ninth session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nThe sponsors of the draft resolution express the\r\nhope that it can be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the representative of South Africa,\r\nwho, in the course of his statement, will introduce draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.39.\r\nMr. Kumalo (South Africa): On behalf of the\r\nAfrican Group, it gives my delegation pleasure to stand\r\nbefore this body to introduce the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union, contained in document A/57/L.39. I am\r\npleased to announce that the following countries have\r\njoined as sponsors of the draft resolution: Algeria,\r\nAngola, Belgium, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso,\r\nBurundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cape Verde,\r\nthe Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, the\r\nComoros, the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Cyprus, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, the\r\nDominican Republic, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea,\r\nEritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,\r\nGuinea-Bissau, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Lesotho,\r\nLiberia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Madagascar,\r\nMalawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique,\r\nNamibia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal,\r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, the Sudan, Swaziland,\r\nTimor-Leste, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, the United\r\nRepublic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\r\nWhen the African Union held its summit in\r\nDurban, South Africa, the heads of State and\r\nGovernment took decisions that were aimed at\r\naccelerating sustainable development in the continent.\r\nIn adopting the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), Africa took steps which\r\ncoincided with the Millennium Development Goals\r\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration adopted by\r\nthis body two years ago.\r\nMy delegation wishes to take note of the\r\nelaborate and incisive report of Secretary-General on\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union. In particular, we welcome the creation\r\nof an Office that will coordinate issues related to\r\nAfrica within the United Nations system. This, we\r\nbelieve, will facilitate and consolidate the work of all\r\nUnited Nations agencies with a view to enhancing their\r\neffectiveness.\r\nThe draft resolution on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the African Union lays a very solid\r\nfoundation upon which the relationship between the\r\ntwo organizations will be built and determines the\r\nfuture of Africa and our commitment to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The relationship between the two\r\norganizations is rightly being reviewed to reflect the\r\nestablishment of the African Union. In this regard, the\r\ndraft resolution highlights new institutions of the\r\nAfrican Union aimed at establishing peace and security\r\nin the continent. These structures are the African Union\r\nPeace Fund, the Panel of the Wise, a military staff\r\ncommittee and an African standby force.\r\nAny assistance — technical, financial and/or\r\notherwise — aimed at facilitating the establishment of\r\nthese structures by the African Union will enhance the\r\ncapability of the continent and its member States in\r\nmatters related to conflict management, prevention and\r\nresolution. The African Union has adopted and is\r\ncurrently implementing a Memorandum of\r\nUnderstanding on Security, Stability, Development and\r\nCooperation to enhance and stabilize the continent.\r\nThe African Union and the international\r\ncommunity are focused in their commitment to fight\r\nterrorism. The continent believes that this fight against\r\nterrorism can be successful only if it is based on\r\ninternational cooperation. At the continental level,\r\nAfrican States have adopted the Algiers Convention on\r\nthe Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and the\r\nPlan of Action that was adopted in Algiers, Algeria, on\r\n14 September 2002. I am pleased that this Convention\r\nhas been ratified by sufficient African States and is due\r\nto enter into force on 6 December 2002. We believe\r\nthat these efforts complement the determination of the\r\nUnited Nations as a collective to fight against\r\nterrorism.\r\nIn Africa, the common and most vivid terror\r\ncommitted against civilian populations is through the\r\nuse of small arms. These small arms are on many\r\noccasions bartered in exchange for illicit drugs. We\r\ntherefore have an interest in enhancing cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union in\r\nthe fight against illicit trafficking in drugs, small arms\r\nand light weapons.\r\nGlobalization presents a special challenge to\r\nAfrica, especially in relation to matters of trade. We\r\nlook forward to the start of the Doha Development\r\nRound, especially as it shall address the improvement\r\nof market access for African products in order to\r\npromote sustainable growth in Africa.\r\nThe draft resolution urges the United Nations and\r\nits Member States to increase their support for Africa\r\nin its fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria\r\nand other, related infectious diseases. Critical to these\r\nefforts is the need to address the plight of children who\r\nmay be left orphans due to such communicable\r\ndiseases. To this end, Member States are further called\r\nupon to implement the Plan of Action on a world fit for\r\nchildren.\r\nAfrica has further committed itself to improving\r\nhuman rights by adopting the Protocol Establishing an\r\nAfrican Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights. It is\r\nanticipated that the process towards establishing such a\r\ncourt will be finalized soon. Human rights will not be\r\nfully enjoyed in the continent as long as a large number\r\nof its people are refugees and internally displaced. In\r\nan attempt to complement Africa’s efforts, the United\r\nNations is called upon to support the African countries\r\nin efforts to incorporate problems of refugees,\r\nreturnees and internally displaced persons into national\r\nand regional development plans.\r\nAfrica is establishing institutions that will\r\nenhance a culture of democracy, good governance,\r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law in an\r\nattempt to enhance popular participation in matters of\r\ngovernance. These structures — such as the Pan-\r\nAfrican Parliament, the African Court of Justice, the\r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Council and the\r\nFinancial Institutions — will strengthen and entrench\r\ndemocratic institutions and accountability in Africa.\r\nThe draft resolution rightfully calls upon the United\r\nNations system and invites the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions to assist as appropriate in the establishment\r\nof such institutions.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to propose a\r\nslight amendment to the fourth preambular paragraph\r\nof the draft resolution before us. We would like to\r\ncorrect the date on which the G8 summit at\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nKananaskis, Canada, was held. The date “28 June\r\n2002” should be replaced by “27 June 2002”.\r\nMy delegation hopes that the General Assembly\r\nwill adopt this draft resolution by acclamation.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on the\r\nrepresentative of Romania, who, in the course of his\r\nstatement, will introduce draft resolution A/57/L.40.\r\nMr. Niculescu (Romania): It is a privilege for me\r\nto address the General Assembly on agenda item 22,\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations”, and, more specifically, on its\r\nsub-item (q) on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.\r\nI should like to commend the presentation made\r\nthis morning by Mr. Wolfgang Hoffman, Executive\r\nSecretary of the Preparatory Commission, which to our\r\nmind illustrates the efficient work carried by the\r\nCommission in Vienna.\r\nAs a State party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT), Romania is fully committed\r\nto its early entry into force and implementation. In our\r\nview, a good relationship between the United Nations\r\nand the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nOrganization (CTBTO) is instrumental to building a\r\nmore peaceful and secure world through disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation. From that perspective, we\r\nbelieve that reports delivered to the General Assembly\r\non a regular basis by the Executive Secretary of the\r\nPreparatory Commission on the activities of the\r\nOrganization are useful and welcome.\r\nIn its capacity as Chairman of the Preparatory\r\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty Organization, the Romanian delegation has the\r\nhonour and the pleasure to introduce to the Assembly\r\nfor adoption the draft resolution contained in document\r\nA/57/L.40, entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\nOrganization”. The draft resolution is based on the\r\nconsultations held in Vienna and New York.\r\nLike similar texts in the past, the draft resolution\r\nis basically a procedural one and is meant to serve as a\r\nbasis for the CTBTO to inform the General Assembly\r\non its activities at its fifty-ninth session. In its\r\npreambular part, the draft resolution takes note of both\r\nthe note by the Secretary-General on the cooperation\r\nbetween the two organizations and the report of the\r\nExecutive Secretary. In its operative paragraph, it\r\ndecides to include in the provisional agenda of the\r\nfifty-ninth session the same sub-item.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express our hope\r\nthat this draft resolution will be adopted by the General\r\nAssembly with the broadest support possible.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Kanu Agabi, Attorney-General and\r\nMinister of Justice of Nigeria, who, in the course of his\r\nstatement, will introduce draft resolution A/57/L.18.\r\nMr. Agabi (Nigeria): I take this opportunity as\r\nthe current President of the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO) to introduce the\r\ndraft resolution entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization” (A/57/L.18). I will also\r\nspeak briefly on behalf of my Government, the Federal\r\nRepublic of Nigeria, on the activities of AALCO.\r\nThe role of AALCO in the field of international\r\nlaw as an intergovernmental organization comprising\r\n45 countries from Asia and Africa is well known.\r\nMembers will recall vividly the significant\r\ncontributions AALCO has made in shaping the\r\ninternational legal regime relating to the law of the sea,\r\nthe law of treaties and arbitration. There is virtually no\r\nfield of international law that AALCO has not taken up\r\nat one time or another during the 46 years of its\r\nexistence.\r\nThe organization’s current programme includes\r\nseveral issues of great importance for our member\r\nStates, which are discussed at our annual sessions, and\r\nat meetings and seminars. My Government, Nigeria,\r\nhosted the forty-first session of AALCO in Abuja in\r\nJuly this year. It was a session memorable not only for\r\nits high-level participation, but also for its in-depth\r\nconsideration of issues such as human rights, the\r\nprotection of migrant workers, trafficking in women\r\nand children, international terrorism, the environment,\r\nsustainable development, the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, ongoing negotiations on\r\nthe World Trade Organization and issues related to\r\nglobalization.\r\nThe success recorded during that session was due\r\nto the cooperation of all the delegations that\r\nparticipated and of the AALCO secretariat. I am,\r\ntherefore, pleased to extend the appreciation of the\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nGovernment of Nigeria to all the delegations that\r\nparticipated and that contributed to the success of that\r\nmeeting. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the\r\ntireless efforts of the Secretary-General, Ambassador\r\nWafik Kamil, and the secretariat.\r\nSince the last time this item was considered by\r\nthe General Assembly, our organization has\r\naccomplished a number of tasks. With a view to\r\nexpanding our knowledge base, AALCO has signed\r\ncooperation agreements with the World Intellectual\r\nProperty Organization, the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,\r\nthe United Nations University and the International\r\nOrganization for Migration.\r\nUnder the able leadership of our Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Ambassador Kamil, issues relating to\r\ntrafficking in women and children, migration,\r\ncorruption and intellectual property rights, matters\r\nhitherto considered peripheral, have been accorded a\r\nplace of priority and have received substantial focus\r\nwithin the work programme.\r\nGiven the transnational character of the\r\nglobalization process, we are conscious of the fact that\r\nit will be increasingly difficult to deal with\r\ninternational law in isolation and divorced from the\r\npolitical and social realities that dictate the response of\r\nStates to these issues. The historic, cultural and\r\ndevelopmental differences among States have\r\nobviously to be taken into account in creating norms\r\nfor a global society.\r\nGlobalization should not be confined to the\r\nopening of borders for the free passage of goods. In our\r\nthinking, borders must also be open for the passage of\r\nmen and women whose motives are legitimate.\r\nGlobalization must lead to the realization of the ideal\r\nof one humanity and one world without boundaries. It\r\nshould mean that no nation should be a safe haven for\r\nthe proceeds of corruption. It should mean that the\r\nproceeds of corruption should be surrendered to the\r\nnations that are the victims of corruption. It should\r\nmean that corrupt officials from Africa and Asia can be\r\ntried and punished wherever they take refuge. That will\r\ngo a long way towards reducing crimes associated with\r\nmoney laundering, terrorism and corruption.\r\nIt is against that backdrop that AALCO, as a body\r\nof mostly developing and least developed countries,\r\nstrives for a balanced, flexible and responsible\r\napproach to international law. The resolutions and\r\nstudies of AALCO on the elimination of terrorism and\r\nits root causes, the responsibility of States to halt the\r\nemission of greenhouse gases and the use of trade as a\r\ntool for promoting environmental goals attest to this\r\nunique approach.\r\nAs regards technical assistance and capacity-\r\nbuilding, AALCO plans to reinvigorate its training\r\nprogramme for officials of its member States under its\r\nCentre for Research and Training. It has also embarked\r\nupon a programme for dissemination of information on\r\ninternational law matters and proposes to publish an\r\nannual publication: the Asian-African Yearbook on\r\nInternational Law.\r\nTime does not permit me to elaborate on the\r\nspecific activities of AALCO. I would like to say that\r\nover the past 46 years, AALCO has provided a useful\r\nforum for exchanging views and for arriving at\r\ncommon positions on crucial issues of international\r\nlaw. It has great potential in meeting the new\r\nchallenges posed in the context of the development of\r\nnew rules and a new framework of international law in\r\nthe twenty-first century. The comprehensive work\r\nprogramme on its agenda demonstrates member States’\r\ninterest in further strengthening its activities. Its\r\nresolve to make concerted efforts together with the\r\nUnited Nations, its agencies and other\r\nintergovernmental organizations deserves full support.\r\nWith that objective in view, I would like to\r\ncommend to the Assembly for adoption of the draft\r\nresolution contained in document A/57/L.18, on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization.\r\nThe draft resolution very appropriately makes\r\nreference to the close cooperation between AALCO\r\nand United Nations agencies. The draft resolution also\r\nnotes with appreciation AALCO’s work aimed at\r\naiding and facilitating the efforts of the United Nations\r\non issues relating to combating corruption, eliminating\r\ninternational terrorism and human and drug trafficking,\r\nand the promotion of human rights.\r\nIn the light of the legal work undertaken by\r\nAALCO, it is necessary to promote close interaction\r\nbetween AALCO and the Sixth Committee of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. By the unanimous agreement of\r\nAALCO and in order to reduce the problems that might\r\narise, we have deleted paragraph 6 of the draft\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.53\r\nresolution. The operative part of the draft resolution\r\ntherefore reads as follows.\r\n“[The General Assembly] [t]akes note with\r\nappreciation of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral;\r\n“Notes with satisfaction the continuing\r\nefforts of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization towards strengthening the role of\r\nthe United Nations and its various organs in\r\nenhancing the rule of law and wider adherence to\r\nrelated international instruments;\r\n“Also notes with satisfaction the\r\ncommendable progress achieved towards\r\nenhancing cooperation between the United\r\nNations, its organizations, other international\r\norganizations and the Consultative Organization;\r\n“Notes with appreciation the work of the\r\nConsultative Organization aiming at\r\nstrengthening the efforts of the United Nations in\r\nrespect of issues such as combating corruption,\r\ninternational terrorism and trafficking as well as\r\ndrugs and human rights issues;\r\n“Also notes with appreciation the initiative\r\nand efforts the Consultative Organization has\r\nundertaken to promote the objectives and\r\nprinciples set out in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration, including wider\r\nacceptance of treaties deposited with the\r\nSecretary-General;\r\n“Requests the Secretary-General to submit\r\nto the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session\r\na report on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Consultative Organization;\r\n“Decides to include in the provisional\r\nagenda of its fifty-ninth session the item entitled\r\n‘Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Organization’.”\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
