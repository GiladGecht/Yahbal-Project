All\r\nthose reports certainly deserve great attention and merit\r\nextensive review by this body. In the meantime, I\r\nwould like to take this opportunity to focus on three\r\nreports of the Secretary-General, namely, those relating\r\nto cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nThe report entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference”, contained in document A/57/405,\r\ndemonstrates that the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) have\r\nbeen working in close cooperation on wide-ranging\r\nissues in their common search for solutions to global\r\nproblems, including questions relating to international\r\npeace and security, disarmament, self-determination,\r\ndecolonization, fundamental human rights and\r\neconomic and social development.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations encourages\r\nactivities through regional cooperation for the\r\npromotion of the purposes and principles of the United\r\nNations. My delegation therefore believes that\r\ndeepening relations between the two organizations\r\nthrough high-level contacts, regular consultations and\r\ntechnical meetings could contribute to the fulfilment of\r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations.\r\nFortunately, in recent years new avenues for\r\nbetter and strengthened cooperation between the OIC\r\nand the United Nations funds, programmes and\r\nspecialized agencies have been explored. Significant\r\nprogress in this field has been made in the widespread\r\ncooperation between the OIC and its subsidiary bodies\r\nand the United Nations Educational, Scientific and\r\nCultural Organization. The two organizations\r\ncontinued to refine their joint cooperation to better\r\nreflect and respond to the priorities of their member\r\nStates — which are also the priorities agreed upon in\r\nthe general meetings between the United Nations and\r\nthe OIC — such as education, the eradication of\r\nilliteracy, the development of science and technology,\r\nhuman resource development and the environment.\r\nMy delegation also hopes that the United Nations\r\nand other organizations of the United Nations system,\r\nparticularly the lead agencies, provide increased\r\ntechnical and other forms of assistance to the OIC and\r\nits subsidiary organs and specialized and affiliated\r\ninstitutions in order to enhance cooperation.\r\nIn view of the future cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OIC, I believe that combating\r\nIslamophobia is one area with regard to which both\r\norganizations could consider taking joint action. There\r\nshould be no doubt that the bigoted and defamatory\r\nremarks against Islam that are sometimes widely\r\nbroadcast by the far-reaching media of the United\r\nStates hurt 1.2 billion Muslims everywhere and have an\r\nadverse impact on them across the globe, thus harming\r\nthe quest for furthering understanding within the\r\ninternational community. At a time when the United\r\nNations is at the forefront of efforts aimed at enhancing\r\npeace and harmony among nations and followers of\r\ndifferent faiths in the world, we believe that we need to\r\nlook into such Islamophobia and see what the United\r\nNations, in association with the OIC, can do to thwart\r\nit.\r\nGiven the fact that there already exist areas of\r\nsuspicion and disagreement between the West and the\r\nIslamic world, we are concerned that the recent surge\r\nin bigotry against Islam amounts to adding fuel to the\r\nfire and exacerbates the situation. While those who\r\nindulge in damaging rhetoric are acting irresponsibly,\r\nwe can still be optimistic about Member States\r\nappreciating the importance of the issue and uniting to\r\ncheck the growth of this tendency.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOIC may provide for some activities, including\r\nawareness-raising, encouraging Member States to take\r\nactions and alerting the media to the adverse impact of\r\nIslamophobia on peace and harmony at the\r\ninternational level. Inasmuch as misinformation and\r\nmisperceptions reside at the origin of the problem,\r\naccess through United Nations channels, in which the\r\nOIC should actively participate, may have an important\r\neffect.\r\nCooperation and joint programmes and projects\r\nbetween the United Nations system and the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (ECO) should be promoted\r\nand encouraged, particularly between ECO and bodies\r\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP), the United Nations Conference on Trade and\r\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), the International\r\nTelecommunication Union, the Economic and Social\r\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the\r\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization,\r\nthe United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme (UNDCP), the United Nations Population\r\nFund (UNFPA) and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO). UNDP\r\nshould be more involved in the area of capacity-\r\nbuilding with the ECO secretariat and its relevant\r\nprogrammes. Cooperation with UNCTAD in the areas\r\nof transit transport, regional investment and trade\r\nefficiency is expected to progress further since there\r\nare ample opportunities to strengthen that type of\r\ncooperation.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nESCAP, as the main regional commission dealing\r\nwith our region, continued to be very active\r\nindividually and in cooperation and collaboration with\r\nother bodies within the United Nations system and\r\nother development and financial institutions in the\r\nECO region. There are still enormous opportunities for\r\nexpanding such cooperation between ESCAP and ECO,\r\nand it should be extended to new areas, including the\r\narea of social environment. The Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe (ECE), another United Nations regional\r\ncommission, can also play a similar role, particularly in\r\nassisting the Central Asian members of ECO.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the new phase of\r\ncooperation between UNDCP AND ECO for\r\ncoordinating the control of illicit drugs, cooperation of\r\nUNFPA with ECO in addressing HIV/AIDS and\r\nadolescent health, and FAO collaboration with ECO in\r\ndeveloping the agricultural sector and food security.\r\nWe are quite confident that new fields of cooperation\r\ncan be explored jointly and can be operationalized with\r\nother agencies, such as the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund and the United Nations Development Fund for\r\nWomen, by addressing the social aspects of combating\r\nnarcotic drugs, particularly their main victims —\r\nwomen and children. The United Nations Educational,\r\nCultural and Scientific Organization and the World\r\nTourism Organization should also become more active\r\nwith ECO in the area of cultural development and\r\ntourism.\r\nFurthermore, the region also continues to be\r\nafflicted by the problem of the illicit cultivation,\r\nproduction, trafficking and consumption of narcotic\r\ndrugs, whose serious adverse impact on the social,\r\neconomic and security infrastructure of the regional\r\ncountries is well known to the international\r\ncommunity. There should be a comprehensive strategy\r\nat various levels to address this major socio-economic\r\nchallenge to the region. Strengthening economic\r\nperformance, the expansion of trade and investment, as\r\nwell as poverty eradication in the region, are the major\r\ncomponents of such a strategy.\r\nUndoubtedly, the reconstruction of Afghanistan,\r\nespecially reviving its economy through international\r\nassistance and regional cooperation, can contribute\r\nenormously to the success of that strategy. While\r\naddressing that issue, let me add that the reconstruction\r\nof Afghanistan is one of the major priorities of the\r\nECO member States. ECO is establishing trilateral\r\ncooperation with third countries as the most viable and\r\ncost effective option for expanding economic and trade\r\ncooperation between Afghanistan and neighbouring\r\ncountries, which is vital to reviving its economy.\r\nFinally, I would like to make some comments on\r\nthe report entitled “Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization”, contained in document A/57/122. As\r\nthe report illustrates, the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO) continues to carry\r\nout systematic and consistent analyses of the agenda\r\nitems of the Sixth Committee and the International Law\r\nCommission from Asian and African perspectives.\r\nCommentaries and recommendations of this\r\norganization remain a source of inspiration for its\r\nmember States in their deliberations on issues before\r\nthe General Assembly and continue to be reflected\r\ndirectly or indirectly in the proceedings of the legal\r\norgans of the United Nations. The wide range of topics\r\non the AALCO agenda is indicative of that\r\norganization’s resolve to positively contribute to\r\ncollective efforts aimed at tackling the new challenges\r\nof the international community. AALCO closely\r\nmonitors legal developments relating to international\r\neconomic cooperation for development and continues\r\nto keep that issue on its agenda.\r\nThe question of refugees — a topic on which the\r\norganization has done a lot of work — trade law\r\nmatters, crime prevention and combating corruption\r\nhave also been the subject of study and deliberation by\r\nthe organization. Cooperation between the United\r\nNations and AALCO has proved to be fruitful and has\r\nserved the mutual interests of the two organizations.\r\nThat collaboration has been developed further in recent\r\nyears and is being carried out in several forums,\r\ncovering various subjects of great importance to the\r\ninternational community as a whole. We feel that\r\nprospects for future cooperation between the United\r\nNations and AALCO are promising.\r\nMs. Løj (Denmark): I have the honour to speak\r\non behalf of the European Union. The Central and\r\nEastern European countries associated with the\r\nEuropean Union — Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,\r\nEstonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,\r\nSlovakia and Slovenia — and the associated countries,\r\nCyprus, Malta and Turkey, as well as the European\r\nFree Trade Association country member of the\r\nEuropean Economic Area, Iceland, align themselves\r\nwith this statement.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations is in many ways an\r\nimportant issue. Let me begin by mentioning a few of\r\nthe reasons that underline the importance of the issue.\r\nFirst, regional and other international organizations are\r\noften being called upon to provide expert assistance\r\nand advice to complement the efforts of the United\r\nNations. Secondly, effective cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations\r\ncan lead to increased cost-efficiency, broader outreach\r\nand legitimacy, while simultaneously minimizing the\r\ndanger of duplication. Needless to say, the European\r\nUnion is therefore very supportive of efforts aimed at\r\nbroadening and deepening well-functioning\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations. The European Union\r\ncommends the Secretary-General for the reports that\r\nhave been presented on this subject. They provide a\r\nclear and informative overview, and form an excellent\r\nbasis for our debate today.\r\nThe European Union remains very supportive of\r\nthe chosen approach of conducting a single joint debate\r\non all the agenda items concerning cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations. Allow me to discuss a few aspects of\r\nthis debate that the European Union considers to be of\r\nparticular importance.\r\nThe European Union warmly welcomes the\r\nestablishment of the new African Union at its Summit\r\nin Durban in July. The European Union considers the\r\nAfrican Union as the central organization for the\r\nregional integration of the African continent. The\r\ncreation of the African Union is a landmark event that\r\ncould give Africa a new start. The European Union\r\nparticularly welcomes the strong emphasis on the links\r\namong peace, stability, good governance and\r\ndevelopment that is embedded in the African Union. In\r\nthat context, the European Union fully supports the\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD)\r\nas an Africa-owned and Africa-led initiative. The\r\nEuropean Union considers that NEPAD provides an\r\nexcellent basis for a new partnership between Africa\r\nand the international community. A central feature of\r\nNEPAD is that it recognizes an operational link\r\nbetween economic growth and development and the\r\nNEPAD principles of political and economic good\r\ngovernance, the rule of law, democratization and\r\nrespect for human rights. NEPAD has the potential to\r\npave the way for the new African Union and to give it\r\nreal content.\r\nThe implementation of NEPAD can be fostered\r\nby enhanced regional cooperation. In that respect, the\r\nEuropean Union attaches great importance to the\r\ndialogue between the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) and the European Union. The\r\nministerial conference between SADC and the\r\nEuropean Union held in Maputo from 7 to 8 November\r\n2002 welcomed the formulation of the Regional\r\nIndicative Programme and the process of regional\r\nintegration as the basis for future European Union\r\nsupport. Furthermore, the conference acknowledged\r\nthat regional organizations play a special role in\r\nconflict-prevention, conflict-resolution and\r\npeacekeeping, and that this role should be reinforced.\r\nAs an active participant in the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the\r\nEuropean Union attaches great significance to the\r\nimplementation of the Platform for Cooperative\r\nSecurity. It underlines the importance of cooperation\r\nbetween the OSCE and other international\r\norganizations on the basis of their comparative\r\nadvantages. The heart of the OSCE is its\r\ncomprehensive concept of security, covering the\r\npolitical-military dimension, the economic and\r\nenvironmental dimension, and the human rights\r\ndimension. The OSCE is promoting security,\r\ndemocracy and human rights in all three dimensions.\r\nThe fight against terrorism has been at the\r\nforefront of the cooperation between the OSCE and the\r\nUnited Nations. In adopting the Bucharest Plan of\r\nAction and the Bishkek Programme of Action last year,\r\nthe OSCE underscored its resolve to contribute to the\r\ninternational anti-terrorism strategy led by the United\r\nNations. A good example of such collaboration was the\r\nhigh-level meeting on terrorism held in Lisbon in June,\r\nwhere the United Nations and various international and\r\nregional organizations reaffirmed their commitment to\r\nthe development of mutually reinforcing efforts. Such\r\ncommitment is at the heart of the draft OSCE charter\r\non preventing and combating terrorism, which is to be\r\nadopted at the forthcoming OSCE Ministerial Council\r\nin Porto.\r\nWhen it comes to efforts at conflict prevention,\r\ncrisis management and rehabilitation, the cooperation\r\nestablished between the OSCE field missions and the\r\nUnited Nations in the Balkans, Georgia and Tajikistan\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nremains successful. The European Union will\r\ncontinuously seek to foster coordination, cooperation\r\nand synergy among the OSCE, the United Nations and\r\nother international organizations working to promote\r\nsecurity, stability, democracy and human rights in the\r\nOSCE region.\r\nThe European Union follows developments in\r\nLatin America very closely, and is concerned about the\r\nworsened economic situation in a number of countries,\r\nsuch as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil. The\r\nEuropean Union supports the efforts made by those\r\ncountries to overcome the economic crisis, and also\r\nstands firmly behind the regional integration processes\r\nin the Common Market of the South, the Andean\r\nCommunity and Central America, which, in spite of\r\npolitical and economic difficulties in the region, have\r\ndemonstrated the region’s commitment to the\r\ndevelopment of democratic societies.\r\nThe European Union also follows closely\r\ndevelopments in South-East Asia, and is concerned\r\nabout the various terrorist treats in the region and about\r\nthe many unsolved internal conflicts that contribute to\r\npolitical instability. In the light of the recent bomb\r\nattack in Bali and the incidents in the Philippines, the\r\nEuropean Union fully supports the efforts made in the\r\nregion and within the framework of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations to further develop regional\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe European Union is prepared to continue its\r\nactive support for, and cooperation with, the Caribbean\r\nCommunity on the creation of the Caribbean Single\r\nMarket and Economy and to implement the Programme\r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small\r\nIsland Developing States.\r\nThe European Union takes note of the positive\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum, and encourages the Secretary-General\r\nand the President of the Pacific Islands Forum to\r\ncontinue and strengthen cooperation in areas of mutual\r\ninterest. Coordination and cooperation with the\r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations and with\r\nregional and other organizations should also be\r\npromoted.\r\nThe United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nare complementary in their endeavours to protect and\r\nstrengthen democracy, human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms and the rule of law. In recent years, the\r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe have worked\r\ntogether closely on several missions and in the\r\norganization of United Nations special sessions and\r\ninternational conferences. In the wake of the attacks of\r\n11 September 2001, the two organizations have\r\nincreased their mutual cooperation in the international\r\nfight against terrorism. The States members of the\r\nEuropean Union confirm their full support for the\r\nEuropean Court of Human Rights and for the system of\r\nhuman rights protection in Europe, of which the Court\r\nis a central component.\r\nThe European Union attaches great importance to\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and national\r\nparliaments through the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\n(IPU), and it commends the two organizations for their\r\nefforts to develop appropriate cooperation procedures,\r\nincluding the invitation to the IPU to participate as an\r\nobserver in the work of the General Assembly. It\r\nwelcomes the initiatives taken by the two organizations\r\nto allow parliaments to contribute to major events\r\norganized by the United Nations. The European Union\r\nfirmly believes that national parliaments, working\r\nthrough the IPU, can play a positive role in terms of\r\ncomplementing and supporting the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe European Union notes with satisfaction that\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference has been\r\nfurther developed during the past year. The periodic\r\nhigh-level meetings between the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference are\r\nimportant to maintaining continuity in deepening the\r\ndialogue between the two organizations.\r\nEnhanced cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the League of Arab States is also of\r\nimportance to the European Union. The Union is\r\ntherefore pleased to note that the two organizations\r\nhave established close contacts on a number of issues\r\nin a diverse array of fields, including politics,\r\neconomics and culture.\r\nThe European Union is pleased to note that\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie has\r\ncontinued to expand over the past year. The\r\ncooperation covers many issues of common interest,\r\nnot least in the fields of democracy, good governance\r\nand human rights.\r\nThe European Union is pleased to note the\r\ncontinuing cooperation between the United Nations and\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nthe Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. That body has\r\ncontinued to give firm support to United Nations efforts,\r\nin particular in the field of international security, arms\r\ncontrol, non-proliferation and disarmament. The\r\nEuropean Union believes that the two organizations\r\nsupport and complement each other in their work for\r\nnuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.\r\nThe European Union has always attached great\r\nimportance to the activities of the Organization for the\r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, particularly given\r\nthe risk that such weapons might fall into the hands of\r\nterrorists. The European Union therefore strongly\r\nencourages the further development of cooperation and\r\ncollaboration with the United Nations Secretariat in\r\nthis field.\r\nLet me conclude by emphasizing that enhanced\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other international organizations in many ways has\r\nthe potential to increase the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the organizations involved and at the\r\nsame time to prevent the risk of duplication. The\r\nexisting inter-institutional dialogue should therefore be\r\ncontinued and intensified, so as to strengthen the spirit\r\nof cooperation and coordination. The European Union\r\nstrongly encourages the United Nations to continue its\r\nefforts to enhance cooperation with regional and other\r\ninternational organizations.\r\nMr. Cheah (Malaysia): My delegation is pleased\r\nto participate in the debate on agenda item 22, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations”. We attach particular\r\nimportance to this debate because we realize the\r\nimportance of consolidating the global efforts of the\r\nUnited Nations with those of regional and other\r\nintergovernmental organizations. We believe that there\r\nis an increasing need to enhance interaction and\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and these\r\norganizations in order for their respective efforts to be\r\neffective and mutually complementary.\r\nIn its statement on this item, my delegation will\r\nfocus on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), the Organization\r\nof the Islamic Conference (OIC), the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the African\r\nUnion (AU).\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union. That cooperation, which began in\r\n1947, was strengthened with the signing of the\r\ncooperation agreement between the United Nations and\r\nthe IPU in 1996. The Secretary-General’s report,\r\ncontained in document A/57/375, has comprehensively\r\ndetailed the various initiatives undertaken by both\r\norganizations in the areas of peace and security,\r\neconomic and social development, issues related to\r\nchildren and women, international law, human rights,\r\ndemocracy, drug trafficking, transnational organized\r\ncrime and terrorism.\r\nIt is indeed appropriate for the General Assembly\r\nto acknowledge the contribution of the IPU to the work\r\nof the Assembly and also important for the IPU to be\r\nallowed to participate in the work and activities of the\r\nGeneral Assembly and its subsidiary bodies. In that\r\nregard, my delegation welcomes the granting by the\r\nGeneral Assembly of observer status to the IPU\r\nyesterday. This will enable it to have a more\r\nmeaningful, productive and significant relationship\r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nWith regard to cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, my delegation would first of all like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report, contained in\r\ndocument A/57/405. We warmly welcome the\r\ncontinued strengthening of relations between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OIC through high-level\r\ncontacts, regular consultations and technical meetings.\r\nWe are particularly pleased with the general meeting on\r\ncooperation between representatives of the United\r\nNations system and of the OIC and its specialized\r\ninstitutions held in Vienna from 9 to 11 July 2002,\r\nproviding for extensive exchanges in areas of common\r\nconcern to both organizations. We welcome the\r\nidentification of 10 agreed priority areas of cooperation\r\nand concur with the view that as cooperation expands\r\nnew areas of interaction might be considered without\r\nprejudice to our priorities.\r\nMy delegation is delighted to note that the OIC\r\nhas already participated in United Nations meetings\r\nand that, likewise, the United Nations has participated\r\nin OIC meetings. We believe that this denotes the\r\npositive role of both organizations and their high\r\nregard for each other as partners in the common search\r\nfor solutions to global problems. In that regard,\r\nMalaysia looks forward to the participation of the\r\nUnited Nations at the tenth OIC Summit, to be held in\r\nKuala Lampur in October 2003.\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nWe recognize that since the OIC became an\r\nobserver to the United Nations in 1975 important\r\nprogress has been made in the cooperation between the\r\ntwo organizations in the political, economic and social\r\nareas. In fact, the OIC, including its subsidiary bodies, has\r\nentered into cooperation agreements with 13 United\r\nNations specialized agencies, programmes and funds.\r\nWe look forward to the conclusion of the\r\nmemorandum of understanding between the World\r\nFood Programme and the Islamic Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization, which will\r\nformalize and enhance relations between them and will\r\npave the way for joint action in the field of education.\r\nWe are pleased that numerous joint initiatives are\r\nbeing undertaken and that more OIC countries are\r\nbenefiting from them. Therefore, in its firm support for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OIC,\r\nMalaysia confirms its full endorsement of draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.28, which was introduced by the\r\nrepresentative of the Sudan.\r\nMy delegation associates itself fully with the\r\nstatement by the Permanent Representative of\r\nCambodia on behalf of ASEAN this morning. The\r\nUnited Nations and ASEAN have been and, I am\r\nconfident, will continue to be important development\r\npartners in the years to come. Several United Nations\r\nagencies have provided strong support to ASEAN\r\ncountries in diverse areas of, inter alia, poverty\r\neradication, good governance, disaster prevention, the\r\nenvironment and the role of women in society.\r\nIn this regard, the role of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and its long-standing\r\nrelationship with ASEAN stands out and needs no\r\nelaboration. In the communiqué issued after the thirty-\r\nfifth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, held in Brunei\r\nDarussalam in July 2002, ASEAN Foreign Ministers\r\naffirmed the need for enhancing the organization’s\r\ncooperation with the United Nations, as such\r\ncooperation will contribute to ASEAN’s objectives of\r\neconomic growth, sustainable development, social\r\nprogress, cultural development and the promotion of\r\npeace and stability. Enhanced cooperation between\r\nASEAN and the United Nations is indeed laudable and\r\nachievable, and will certainly be of immense benefit to\r\nboth organizations.\r\nMy delegation is also supportive of forging close\r\ncooperation between the African Union and the United\r\nNations as a further development of the close and\r\nproductive cooperation between the former\r\nOrganization of African Unity and the world body. The\r\ndraft resolution before the Assembly in document\r\nA/57/L.39 seeks to enhance and intensify that\r\nrelationship and to bring to it a higher level of\r\ncooperation encompassing many areas, including trade\r\nand economic development, human rights, good\r\ngovernance and the strengthening of democratic\r\ninstitutions, in addition to the promotion of peace and\r\nsecurity on the continent.\r\nGiven the special needs of Africa and the heavy\r\ninvolvement of the United Nations in African-related\r\nissues, it is only appropriate for the African Union to\r\nbuild on the solid relationship that has been established\r\nbetween the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and\r\nthe United Nations, particularly in the context of\r\nAfrica’s ambitious New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which will require a high level\r\nof international support.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation hopes that the draft\r\nresolutions on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and other organizations will receive the\r\nfull support of the Assembly. Malaysia is convinced\r\nthat the United Nations can only benefit from close\r\ncooperation with those organizations. Indeed, the\r\nforging of cooperation between so many regional and\r\nother organizations and the United Nations attests to\r\nthe importance and centrality of the United Nations as\r\nthe pre-eminent and most universal international\r\nOrganization. It is also a manifestation of the abiding\r\nfaith of the international community in multilateralism\r\nand in the United Nations at the centre of the process.\r\nMr. Baali (Algeria) (spoke in French): The item\r\nthat we are considering today, on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations, gives us an overview of the interaction\r\nthat can exist between the United Nations and those\r\norganizations and of the potential for synergy in such\r\ncooperation, which, engaged in wisely, can reconcile\r\nthe need to respect regional and local characteristics\r\nwith the action of the international community,\r\nsomething that is no less necessary in assisting various\r\nareas than in acquiring the support that it needs.\r\nIn that context, I should like to address agenda\r\nitem 22 (m), on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the African Union, which has assumed a\r\nspecial character this year because of the\r\ntransformation of the Organization of African Unity\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\n(OAU) into the African Union (AU) and the launching\r\nof NEPAD. The international community’s welcoming\r\nof those major initiatives — confirmed by the General\r\nAssembly on 16 September with regard to the support\r\nof the United Nations system for NEPAD — calls for\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union, taking into account the dynamic of\r\ninstitutional transformation. My delegation cannot fail\r\nto support the earlier position of the OAU with respect\r\nto considering a programme of cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OAU for 2002, which\r\nbelieved that it would be more prudent to wait for the\r\ndefinition of the structures and functions of the new\r\ncontinental organization before proceeding with that\r\nexercise. We also think that today’s debate can greatly\r\ncontribute to the definition of terms for future\r\ncooperation between the two organizations.\r\nThe United Nations has the principal role with\r\nregard to strengthening the institutional capacities of\r\nthe African Union and mobilizing international support\r\nfor NEPAD’s successful implementation. What is\r\nachieved on the African continent will depend greatly\r\non that. Africa’s economic and social development\r\ncannot be realized without stability, which promotes an\r\nenvironment of peace and security. That truth has been\r\nrecognized by the principal organs of the United\r\nNations — the General Assembly, the Security Council\r\nand the Economic and Social Council — by the\r\nSecretary-General and by African countries\r\nthemselves. We must work together with determination\r\nto put an end to all conflicts and tensions on the\r\ncontinent and to gather and mobilize energies for\r\nreconstruction and development.\r\nThe increasing and consistent participation of\r\nAfrican contingents in peacekeeping missions is well\r\ndemonstrated. That African commitment responds to\r\nthe wishes of the Organization — particularly those of\r\nthe Security Council — and points to the path towards\r\ntruly fruitful cooperation in the future, particularly in\r\nthe area of conflict prevention and settlement. In that\r\nregard, the recommendations of the Security Council\r\nad hoc Working Group on Conflict Prevention and\r\nResolution in Africa, under the able chairmanship of\r\nAmbassador Koonjul of Mauritius, aim to strengthen\r\nthat cooperation through dialogue. We welcome those\r\nrecommendations, and we call for their effective\r\nimplementation.\r\nInteraction between the Organization and the\r\nOAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management\r\nand settlement is a reality that will be enhanced and\r\nfurther structured by the forthcoming establishment of\r\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union.\r\nHowever, for that cooperation to attain all its\r\nobjectives, we must ensure that it does not simply\r\ntransfer to African countries the responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Under\r\nthe terms of the Charter, that lies primarily with the\r\nUnited Nations, which has irreplaceable experience,\r\nprecious human capacities and material resources that\r\nare difficult to acquire at the regional level.\r\nReading the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/57/351) — whom I should like to thank for his\r\ncommitment to Africa — allows one to measure the\r\nextent of cooperation that already exists between the\r\nUnited Nations and the African Union in such varied\r\nareas as economic and social development, humanitarian\r\naction, conflict prevention and settlement and\r\npeacekeeping. In that regard, my delegation welcomes\r\nthe United Nations Secretariat’s expressed willingness\r\nto help the African Union to establish new structures of\r\nits own. My delegation attaches the greatest importance\r\nto the success of the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme (UNDP) support project in planning the\r\ntransition phase from the OAU to the AU, with its\r\nstrategic objective of creating solid institutional\r\ncapacities and a base of resources needed for the new\r\norganization.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation would like to\r\nemphasize the exemplary quality of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the African\r\norganization in the area of decolonization, reflected in\r\nthe joint elaboration of the United Nations Settlement\r\nPlan for Western Sahara, which was confirmed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, endorsed by the Security Council\r\nand accepted by the parties to the conflict. It envisages\r\nthe organization of a referendum on self-determination\r\nfor the Saharawi people. That cooperation must\r\ncontinue, with a view to the future decolonization of\r\nthe African continent’s last non-self-governing Territory.\r\nIn addition, my delegation would like to stress the\r\ndifficulties that face cooperation in the humanitarian\r\nsector. As a result of conflicts and natural disasters, the\r\nnumber of refugees in Africa has reached a disturbing\r\nlevel. The absence of appropriate infrastructures to deal\r\nwith the flow of refugees makes it difficult — and in\r\nsome cases impossible — for the host country to cope\r\nwith such a situation by itself. The Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees must\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nscrupulously discharge the mandate entrusted to it,\r\ntreating all the refugees of the world — whatever their\r\nrace or origin — on a strictly equal basis, because there\r\nare no first-class or second-class refugees. It must no\r\nlonger concern itself with the political settlement of\r\nconflicts, which remains the exclusive domain of\r\nMember States and of competent agencies and organs\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn addition, we note that the problem of resources\r\ncontinues to be acute. In several cases, consolidated\r\nappeals have been launched in vain. Therefore, we\r\nshould like to reiterate those appeals to the\r\ninternational community to provide adequate assistance\r\nto the African Union and to the Governments of\r\nAfrican countries affected by the problems of refugees,\r\nrepatriated persons and displaced persons.\r\nLastly, I would like to speak on the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism. The scourge of transnational\r\nterrorism poses a global threat, from which nobody is\r\nfree.\r\nMy delegation would call for even greater\r\ncooperation between our two organizations, with a\r\nview to implementing the OAU Convention on the\r\nPrevention and the Combating of Terrorism. It now has\r\na sufficient number of accessions for it to enter into\r\nforce. Last September’s conference in Algiers offered a\r\nnew impetus in this respect.\r\nMr. Mobarak (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): Mr.\r\nPresident, I am pleased to convey to you and to\r\nMember States a tribute from the Egyptian\r\nparliamentarians, on whose behalf I speak. We fully\r\nbelieve in the importance of cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations through the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\n(IPU). Cooperation between these two bodies is a\r\nmajor objective of the Egyptian Parliament, and we are\r\ndoing our utmost to encourage this, as we had done\r\nduring Egypt’s presidency of the IPU, from 1995 to\r\n1999.\r\nWe are very pleased that the IPU was\r\nunanimously accorded observer status by the United\r\nNations. Given the shortening of distances between\r\nStates, peoples and cultures caused by the effects of\r\nglobalization, and the repercussions this has\r\nengendered on the internal and external policies of\r\nnations and their relations with one another, it is high\r\ntime for national parliaments to extend their activities\r\nbeyond their national borders, and not confine\r\nthemselves to national policies and legislation. They\r\nshould enter world politics to affect its course in a\r\npositive manner.\r\nWe are calling here for a strengthened role for\r\nworld parliaments in global politics. States must, at the\r\nnational level, live up to the commitments made by\r\ntheir Governments to international treaties and\r\nagreements. There is an increasing phenomenon at the\r\nnational level whereby Governments free themselves\r\nfrom their international treaty obligations in less time\r\nthan they took to negotiate them. That is due to the\r\nabsence of internal supervision to monitor faithful\r\ncompliance with such treaties.\r\nOne clear example of this relates to the 1992\r\nEarth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and its final document,\r\n“Agenda 21”. Developing countries attached great\r\nimportance to Agenda 21, but there was no follow-up\r\naction to implement it. In fact, some countries had\r\ndisengaged themselves to some extent from the\r\ninternational commitments they had entered into at that\r\ntime. Proper parliamentary monitoring at the national\r\nlevels should have compelled Governments to take\r\nsuch commitments more seriously.\r\nJust a few months ago, we all attended the\r\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. A Final Document and Plan of Action\r\nwas adopted there, reflecting international\r\ncommitments on the environment and on sustainable\r\ndevelopment. We hope that those commitments will not\r\nmeet the same fate as the commitments made at Rio de\r\nJaneiro We urge all parliaments in the world to closely\r\nmonitor action taken to implement the final document\r\nfrom Johannesburg, as well as the results from\r\nMonterrey’s International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment and other related action programmes on\r\nthe issue of development.\r\nThe Egyptian delegation would like to underscore\r\nthe suffering of Palestinian parliamentarians due to the\r\nclosure imposed by the Israeli occupation forces. They\r\nare unable to discharge their duties as representatives\r\nof their people. They are not able to move about to\r\nmeet with their constituents or attend the sessions of\r\ntheir parliament. Israel’s policy aims at destroying\r\nPalestinian civil and national institutions, contrary to\r\nclaims Israel makes that it is the only democracy in the\r\nregion. True democracies do not occupy other peoples’\r\nterritories by force or usurp their rights.\r\nIsrael has ignored the fact that Palestinians have\r\nlegislative and executive bodies that have been elected\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nunder international monitoring. Egypt calls on\r\nparliamentarians throughout the world to urge their\r\nGovernments to come to the support of Palestinian\r\nparliamentarians, who are suffering because of the\r\ndestruction of their civil and legislative institutions.\r\nSuch an elected Palestinian legislature would be able to\r\nguide its people towards peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Kolby (Norway): We place great value on\r\nthe subject currently under discussion, “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations”. Only through cooperation on matters of\r\ncommon interest can we realize the full potential and\r\neffectiveness of both the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations.\r\nLet me express my delegation’s continued\r\nsatisfaction that we treat the topic of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and other organizations as\r\none agenda item. This gives us an opportunity to be\r\nmore efficient and to have one debate. However, it also\r\nmakes it difficult to comment on all the equally\r\nimportant sub-items on the agenda. This year I will,\r\ntherefore, comment on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the African Union, the United Nations and\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) and the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU).\r\nWith the required number of ratifications of the\r\nnew Charter, the Organization of African Unity became\r\nthe African Union at the Durban Summit last summer.\r\nThe interim chairperson, Amara Essy, and the South\r\nAfrican chair now have the formidable challenge of\r\nmaking the African Union into a well-functioning\r\norganization.\r\nThe renewed vitality and the modernized focus\r\nand mandate of the African Union shows the\r\ncommitment Africa attaches to the challenges of the\r\ntwenty-first century. This is further underlined by the\r\naspirations embedded in the launching of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The\r\nimportance of strong and practical cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the African Union should be\r\nstressed. The role of the United Nations Economic\r\nCommission for Africa and other United Nations\r\nagencies in enhancing the capacity of the African\r\nUnion Commission to respond to the objectives and\r\ntargets set will be important. As the African Union has\r\nadopted a broad range of objectives and measures to\r\nattain political and economic integration, the capacity\r\nof the Commission will be crucial. Strengthened\r\ncooperation between United Nations and the African\r\nUnion should further enhance the high ambitions for\r\nconflict prevention and resolution, good governance\r\nand democracy of the African nations, as envisaged in\r\nNEPAD and the African Union Charter.\r\nIncreased participation of the African Union in\r\nthe United Nations, its organs and its specialized\r\nagencies should make a valuable contribution to the\r\nwork of the United Nations. Norway is encouraged by\r\nthe strong commitment of the Secretary-General to\r\nfurther enhance such cooperation. The combined\r\nefforts of the two organizations in conflict prevention\r\nand the peace processes on the African continent\r\nshould be further developed.\r\nThe effects of numerous ongoing conflicts on the\r\nAfrican continent only exacerbate poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, drought\r\nand hunger. The conflicts in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, Burundi, the Sudan and Somalia are still\r\nunresolved and require the continued attention of joint\r\nUnited Nations and African Union efforts. The new\r\nNEPAD initiative envisages African leaders taking on\r\nthe responsibility for peace and conflict prevention.\r\nThe strong commitment of African leaders to peace, as\r\nevidenced recently in the Ivory Coast, makes the role\r\nof the United Nations a supportive one. The Durban\r\nSummit’s strong emphasis on continued conflict\r\nprevention, management and resolution through the\r\nestablishment of an African Security Council is\r\nencouraging. However, much remains to be done in\r\norder to have a fully operational set-up for this.\r\nAssistance from the United Nations and bilateral\r\npartners is still required. Norway will continue to\r\nsupport the mechanism and calls for United Nations\r\ntechnical assistance and a coordinated approach by\r\nnon-African United Nations Member States to support\r\nthe capacity of the African Union to handle African\r\nconflicts.\r\nCooperation and coordination between the United\r\nNations and the African Union is especially important\r\nin preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and\r\npeacekeeping operations. Regional efforts by the\r\nAfrican Union to achieve stronger economic and\r\npolitical integration could help prevent further\r\nconflicts. The new African Union has set a very\r\nambitious agenda. The United Nations should play an\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nimportant role in assisting the African Union to realize\r\nthose ambitious objectives.\r\nCooperation between field missions is an\r\nimportant aspect of the relationship between the OSCE\r\nand the United Nations. A well-functioning division of\r\nlabour has been established in many areas of conflict\r\nand instability in the OSCE region, notably in Kosovo,\r\nwhere the OSCE has the responsibility for institution-\r\nbuilding and democratization within the framework of\r\nthe United Nations Interim Administration Mission in\r\nKosovo (UNMIK).\r\nFollowing the terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\n2001 and the war against terrorism in Afghanistan,\r\ncooperation in Central Asia is particularly important.\r\nThe OSCE has offices in all five republics. A number\r\nof United Nations agencies, as well, have well-\r\nestablished programmes in those countries. We should\r\ntherefore look for ways of enhancing coordination and\r\nidentify areas where synergy can be achieved. Division\r\nof labour, based on the comparative advantages of the\r\nrespective organizations, ensures that resources are\r\nused in a cost-effective way.\r\nThe OSCE will continue to be an essential partner\r\nfor the United Nations in the years to come, working\r\nhand in hand with the United Nations in laying the\r\nfoundation for economic and social development and\r\neasing the burden of the United Nations in conflict\r\nprevention and conflict management in the OSCE area.\r\nNorway would like to emphasize the importance\r\nof strengthening parliamentary involvement in the\r\nimportant issues and processes taking place within the\r\nUnited Nations. Parliaments are at the core of every\r\ndemocracy over the world. It is the parliaments that\r\ndecide whether international treaties or agreements\r\nshould be ratified or not, and it is the parliaments that\r\nadopt or amend national laws to follow up those\r\ninternational instruments. And not to forget: it is the\r\nparliaments that make funds available — for\r\ndevelopment cooperation, for international\r\norganizations and processes and for the following-up of\r\nevery new global initiative — through the budgets\r\nadopted in parliaments. Thus, it is only through\r\ncooperation involving the parliaments that the United\r\nNations can fully succeed in reaching its goals and\r\naspirations.\r\nTherefore, Norway welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/57/375), which clearly shows that\r\nthe cooperation between the IPU and the United\r\nNations has been developed even further since the last\r\nsession of the General Assembly. The parliamentarians\r\nwithin the IPU have actively contributed their views\r\nand support in connection with a number of major\r\nUnited Nations events, such as the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on Children and the World Food\r\nSummit.\r\nIn the United Nations Millennium Declaration,\r\nMember States resolved “to strengthen further\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and national\r\nparliaments through their world organization, the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union.” It is with great pleasure that\r\nNorway supports the adoption of the resolution of the\r\nGeneral Assembly which invites the IPU to participate\r\nin the sessions and work of the General Assembly in\r\nthe capacity of observer, and which also allows for the\r\ncirculation of official IPU documents in the Assembly.\r\nThis is a decision long overdue. Nevertheless, we are\r\nconvinced that this decision is an important milestone\r\nin providing the United Nations with a parliamentary\r\ndimension. On the basis of the new and strengthened\r\nstatus of IPU and the cooperation agreement of 1996,\r\nwe would like to urge both organizations to review the\r\ncooperation so far and to consider ways and means to\r\ndeepen and broaden the programme of cooperation in\r\nthe time to come.\r\nMr. Gupta (India): My delegation would like to\r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report (A/57/122)\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAsian-African Legal Consultative Organization\r\n(AALCO).\r\nInternational law is an indispensable instrument\r\nto shape a new world order. International law cannot\r\nacquire the sanctity and universality that are\r\nfundamental to its wider acceptance without adequately\r\naccommodating and reflecting the needs and\r\naspirations of the Asian and African States. Over the\r\nyears, we have witnessed the able participation and\r\nrepresentation of Asian and African States in the work\r\nof the United Nations and its legislative forums. Their\r\ncontribution to the development of the law of treaties\r\nand the law of the sea is memorable, thanks largely to\r\nthe work of the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization as a forum for coordinating and trying to\r\ndevelop common Asian and African negotiating\r\npositions.\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nMember countries continue to receive valuable\r\nassistance from AALCO to help them to prepare for\r\nand participate in a variety of international law\r\nmeetings on the environment, trade and human rights.\r\nA number of declarations and draft principles prepared\r\nby AALCO on subjects like refugees, humanitarian\r\nlaw, extradition, mutual judicial assistance, migration\r\nand investment are also worthy of note. Its continued\r\nemphasis on the work of the International Law\r\nCommission, the law of the sea, terrorism, human\r\nrights, international trade, the environment and the\r\nevolving body of international criminal law will be of\r\nimmense help to Member States. In addition to its\r\nannual meetings and the customary annual meetings of\r\nthe legal advisers of Member States in New York, it has\r\nalso been conducting specialized seminars and\r\nworkshops on contemporary themes of international\r\nlaw. These meetings bring together the best available\r\ntalent of Asia and Africa in international law. There is\r\na need to intensify these interactions.\r\nAALCO has an indispensable role to play in\r\nhelping the Asian and African States to develop\r\nenlightened legal policies and positions and to play\r\ntheir proper part in shaping a just and equitable world\r\norder. Towards that end, it must reorganize its\r\nmandates, gather the necessary funds and build its\r\ninfrastructure. Asian and African States must ensure\r\nthe development of international law expertise through\r\nthe establishment of specialized institutions of legal\r\nlearning. The wider dissemination of developments in\r\ninternational law in an easily accessible form to various\r\nsegments of the community is also essential. There\r\nshould be regular interaction between academic and\r\ngovernmental experts in international law within\r\ncountries and throughout the regions.\r\nAALCO can contribute immensely to that process\r\nwith training programmes, the organization of highly\r\nspecialized and high-quality lectures from leading\r\nexponents of international law, institutional fellowship\r\nprogrammes at the university level and exchanges of\r\nscholars and experts on international law within the\r\ntwo continents. We welcome the establishment of the\r\nAALCO Centre for Research and Training, which is an\r\nimportant step towards achieving those objectives. It is\r\nunderstood that some of these activities can be pursued\r\nonly if more funds are available. The clearance of\r\narrears in contributions, as well as fund-raising through\r\nvoluntary contributions, could help.\r\nIt is heartening to note that the new permanent\r\nhome of AALCO is beginning to take shape in New\r\nDelhi. We hope that by next year the headquarters\r\nbuilding, along with the residential complex for the\r\nSecretary General, should be ready to be occupied. The\r\nacquisition of a new home will give a new dimension\r\nto AALCO and greater depth to all its activities. We\r\nhope that AALCO will attract a much wider\r\nmembership and begin to better equip its member\r\nStates to deal with contemporary problems of\r\ninternational law. We have no doubt that a vigorous\r\ndrive to increase the membership of AALCO will be\r\nundertaken under the leadership of Nigeria.\r\nThe Organization has become a recognized body\r\nof international law in the international community, as\r\nit is the only intergovernmental body of its kind with\r\nobserver status in the United Nations. We hope that the\r\ncooperation between AALCO and the United Nations\r\nwill continue to grow stronger. We cherish our\r\nassociation as a member of AALCO, which has been\r\nserving us as a forum for cooperation in the field of\r\ninternational law. We are optimistic that in the coming\r\nyears, the organization will play a greater role in\r\nhelping to consolidate the common interests of Asian\r\nand African States and that it will achieve its objectives\r\nof training and of disseminating international law\r\nexpertise among Asian and African States, thereby\r\nstrengthening their role in evolving a fair, equitable\r\nand universal legal order.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Bangladesh): I should like to\r\nconvey my felicitations to the President of the General\r\nAssembly for the very smooth progress of the work of\r\nthe fifty-seventh session of the Assembly thus far. We\r\nare confident that, through the joint efforts of the\r\nPresident, his Bureau, the Secretariat and delegations,\r\nthe session will achieve the success that is desired.\r\nWe are here today to discuss the important issue\r\nof cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations. As a multilateral\r\ninternational body, the United Nations has the unique\r\ndistinction of being the largest and most representative\r\nof such bodies. Its vast scope of work, within the\r\nparameters set out by its Charter, is all-encompassing.\r\nIn this work, the United Nations depends for direction,\r\nguidance and support on Member States and relies on\r\nits various organs for the implementation of decisions.\r\nHowever, the very important role played in\r\ncomplementing those efforts by various international,\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nregional and other organizations which do not form\r\npart of the United Nations system may at times be\r\noverlooked. The draft resolutions under consideration\r\ntoday under the agenda item “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations”\r\nwill definitely contribute significantly to overcoming\r\nsuch lapses. The need to strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the various relevant international, regional and\r\nother organizations on the one hand and the United\r\nNations and its organs and agencies on the other does\r\nnot brook any debate. Such cooperation will help\r\nensure the better coordination of the individual and\r\ncooperative efforts made by all those organizations and\r\nthe United Nations in different fields.\r\nI shall briefly say a few words about cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU). Bangladesh welcomes the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union,\r\ncontained in document A/57/375. The report gives an\r\nexcellent account of actions and contributions of\r\nparliamentarians, through the IPU, with respect to\r\nongoing international efforts in promoting peace and\r\nsecurity, sustainable development and human rights.\r\nThe 107th IPU Conference, held in March 2002, made\r\nimportant contributions towards charting a course for\r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Declaration. The\r\nactivities of the IPU, in collaboration with various\r\nUnited Nations bodies, at the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on Children, the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, the World Food Summit, the\r\nsessions of the United Nations Commission on Human\r\nRights and the annual parliamentary hearings at the\r\nUnited Nations are only a few examples of the very\r\nuseful work being carried out by the IPU.\r\nParliamentarians play a crucial role in their\r\nrespective countries by formulating government\r\npolicies and by legislating, as well as by supervising\r\nthe implementation of policies and the enforcement of\r\nlaws. One cannot overemphasize the importance of the\r\nrole of legislators. Through their actions, they\r\ndetermine the policies of their respective nations on the\r\nissues of safeguarding peace and security, ensuring\r\nsustainable development and promoting human rights\r\nand the rule of law, both nationally and worldwide. The\r\naggregate effect of their national efforts contributes to\r\nthe direction that the world takes in fulfilling the goals\r\nand objectives of the United Nations.\r\nTherefore, it is highly important that\r\nparliamentarians and legislators from countries around\r\nthe world have an effective forum for exchange of\r\nviews on all the important issues of the day. The IPU\r\nhas been satisfactorily catering for this need over the\r\nyears. Cooperation between the United Nations system\r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union thus assumes special\r\nsignificance. It enables parliamentarians from different\r\ncountries to have a first-hand insight into the workings\r\nand activities of the United Nations and its various\r\norgans and agencies. It gives them an opportunity to\r\nunderstand issues from a global perspective, thus\r\naffording them the chance to compare the international\r\ndemands and the actual national responses to them\r\nthrough policies and legislation. On the other hand,\r\nsuch cooperation also enables the United Nations and\r\nits organs and agencies to understand and appreciate\r\nthe unique local and national situations, hopes and\r\naspirations that limit and shape the actions of\r\nparliamentarians and legislators.\r\nThe United Nations and other international\r\norganizations often work on the basis of global and\r\nuniversal norms and standards, arrived at through\r\nnegotiations synthesizing differing opinions into a\r\nbroad consensus. Application of these norms and\r\nstandards in the field in different national and local\r\nsituations often requires adjustment and fine tuning,\r\ntaking into account the peculiarities of individual\r\nsituations. The pragmatic and realistic adjustment of\r\npriorities and the variation in interpretation and\r\nassessment often prove to be the key to success. This\r\ndilemma — the gap between broad policies and their\r\nactual implementation in local conditions — can be\r\nseen over a broad spectrum of issues. Strengthening\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IPU\r\nwill go a long way in addressing this dilemma and\r\nreducing the gaps. We are happy that this cooperation\r\nhas been further strengthened by granting the IPU\r\nobserver status in the United Nations through\r\nyesterday’s adoption by the Assembly of a resolution to\r\nthat effect, resolution 57/32.\r\nBangladesh has a long tradition of pluralism and\r\nparliamentary democratic institutions. In spite of many\r\npitfalls and occasional setbacks, the people of\r\nBangladesh have always opted for a participatory form\r\nof democracy. We have a thriving Parliament, where\r\nlegislators impose close supervision through\r\nparliamentary standing committees chaired by\r\nparliamentarians, not by members of the Cabinet.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nBangladeshi parliamentarians actively and regularly\r\nparticipate in the activities of the IPU. Members of\r\nParliament from both the ruling and the opposition\r\nparties interact with their colleagues in other countries\r\nthrough regular exchange programmes. Bangladeshi\r\nparliamentarians have, on occasion, taken initiatives to\r\norganize their colleagues in the region for exchanges of\r\nviews and to formulate common positions and\r\nprogrammes on various issues.\r\nBangladesh and its parliamentarians place\r\nparticular importance on the ever-growing cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU. My\r\ndelegation, therefore, has joined many others in\r\nsponsoring draft resolution A/57/L.38, on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU.\r\nMr. Fall (Senegal) (spoke in French): The\r\ndelegation of Senegal is particularly pleased we in the\r\nAssembly are revisiting, without bias or complacency,\r\nthe already rich cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the African Union (AU) which should now\r\nbe furthered and expanded upon.\r\nIn fulfilling the noble mission entrusted to it in\r\nthe Charter, the Organization has, since the adoption of\r\nresolution 1514 (XV) in 1960, always had, happily,\r\nclose and fruitful ties with a continent which, now\r\nmore than ever before, is aware that the Organization is\r\ntruly close to it — that it feels its heartbeat, that it\r\nrecords its impulses and, in a word, that it heeds its\r\nmost legitimate concerns. In timely fashion, these\r\nconcerns revolve around the challenges and stakes of\r\nthe new age in which we live, hallmarked by\r\nglobalization, a strong and irrepressible reality which\r\nwas in the minds of our leaders when, on 9 July 2002\r\nin Durban, the AU was christened at the baptismal font,\r\nafter having been launched at the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Summit, in Lomé on 10 July\r\n2000, one year after the famous Summit held at Sirte.\r\nThese leaders thus identified the new paths for\r\nAfrica, which converge on three parameters: combating\r\nterrorism, strengthening peace and promoting\r\ndevelopment. To achieve those goals, the support of the\r\nUnited Nations is indispensable.\r\nI will first touch upon the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September 2001 were\r\nregrettable and terrible proof of the scope of the\r\ndamage that the cruel and vile beast we know as\r\nterrorism is capable of committing. Africa, which has\r\nalready paid the cost of this scourge, in particular with\r\nthe deadly attacks that took place a few months prior to\r\nthat in Kenya and in Tanzania, early on took the\r\nmeasure of this serious threat by initiating bold\r\ndecisions.\r\nAt the initiative of the head of State of Senegal,\r\nthe African anti-terrorism summit adopted the Dakar\r\nDeclaration Against Terrorism on 17 October 2001.\r\nThat important step was followed by the holding in\r\nAlgiers on 11 to 14 September 2002 of the All High-\r\nlevel Intergovernmental Meeting on the Prevention and\r\nCombating of Terrorism in Africa, which established\r\nan African agenda aimed at countering this scourge on\r\nAfrican soil, on the basis of the OAU Convention on\r\nthe Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, adopted at\r\nAlgiers on 14 July 1999. Even more recently, other\r\nmeasures have been adopted to root out and eradicate\r\nelements and practices that constitute the backbone of\r\nterrorism. I should like to refer here to a few of the\r\nmost significant examples.\r\nIn that connection, I would like to recall the 1994\r\nTunis Declaration on a Code of Conduct for Inter-\r\nAfrican Relations; the 1996 Yaoundé Declaration and\r\nPlan of Action on Drug Control, Abuse and Illicit Drug\r\nTrafficking in Africa; the 1998 Dakar Declaration on\r\nthe Prevention and Control of Transnational Crime and\r\nCorruption; and the 2000 Bamako Declaration on an\r\nAfrican Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation,\r\nCirculation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons. These initiatives certainly reflect Africa’s\r\nfirm determination to play a more active role in the\r\nfight to eradicate terrorism. However, the success of\r\nthose efforts depends on the active support and\r\nassistance of all partners and, in particular, of the\r\nUnited Nations, which has made peace its main\r\npriority.\r\nI should now like to turn to the subject of\r\nstrengthening peace. Senegal has always believed that\r\nrecovery on the continent, and particularly economic\r\nrecovery, will remain elusive so long as intra- and\r\ninter-State conflicts and tensions and their tragic\r\nhuman consequences persist. It is for that reason that\r\nmy country is committed to participating as fully as\r\npossible by providing troops in the field and well-\r\nknown Senegalese personalities to promote peace in\r\nsuch brotherly countries as the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, the Central African Republic, Sierra Leone\r\nand Madagascar. In the past we have made such\r\ncontributions in Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Burundi and\r\nRwanda. We may soon be doing the same in Côte\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nd’Ivoire and, again, in Liberia, as soon as conditions\r\nallow.\r\nIn order to strengthen the African Union’s Peace\r\nand Security Council’s capacity to intervene, the\r\nUnited Nations, along with the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) Peer Review\r\nMechanism, will be able to provide their assistance in\r\nfacilitating the implementation of the African Council’s\r\nearly-warning system and the establishment of training\r\nprogrammes for military personnel and civilian police.\r\nThey will also be able to extend consistent support to\r\nAfrican countries actively involved in peacekeeping\r\noperations. In that connection, I would like to welcome\r\nthe effective and positive presence of the United\r\nNations in a number of African theatres of operation,\r\nas well as its fruitful cooperation with the African\r\nUnion in the management of the conflicts tearing the\r\ncontinent apart.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to\r\nwelcome in particular the strong message sent by the\r\nSecurity Council to our development partners in order\r\nto mobilize the appropriate technical and financial aid\r\nto enable Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone to\r\nconsolidate the gains made in establishing political and\r\nsocial normalcy in those two countries undergoing\r\nrecovery.\r\nWith regard to nearby Liberia, we continue to\r\nawait decisive support from the United Nations beyond\r\nthe establishment of the International Contact Group on\r\nLiberia, which received its mandate on 17 September\r\n2002 at a ministerial meeting held in New York, at the\r\nrequest of Senegal, current chair of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), whose\r\nSecretary-General was also present at that meeting. It\r\nis high time for a definitive ceasefire in Liberia, and\r\nfor peace once and for all to be established in that\r\ndevastated brotherly country. That would make\r\npossible the speedy deployment of an interposition\r\nforce to that country, as well as the restoration of\r\npeace, security and development in Liberia.\r\nThe stability of the entire region depends upon\r\nthat; a region where divisive elements have arisen in\r\nthe sisterly Republic of Côte d’Ivoire. In that regard,\r\nmy delegation welcomes the firm presidential\r\nstatement of the Security Council — which reflects the\r\nparticular attention the United Nations is giving to this\r\nmatter — to send an African peacekeeping force to that\r\ncountry that has the trust of the parties and the valuable\r\nsupport of the United Nations and, in particular, of the\r\nSecurity Council. To that end, my delegation is hoping\r\nfor a positive outcome of the negotiations that began at\r\nLomé following the agreement on cessation of\r\nhostilities, concluded on 17 October under the auspices\r\nof Senegal.\r\nI would also like to say how much we continue to\r\nappreciate the assistance of the United Nations, which\r\nhas generously made considerable expertise available\r\nto Africa during the design phase preceding the\r\nestablishment of the African Union’s Peace and\r\nSecurity Council. My delegation hopes that this\r\ncooperation will be further strengthened once that new\r\nbody is operational and prepared to assume its\r\nresponsibilities in the areas of the prevention,\r\nmanagement and resolution of conflicts, in order to\r\npromote security on the continent, which is a sine qua\r\nnon condition for economic and social development.\r\nI would now like to turn to the subject of the\r\npromotion of African development. Drawing from the\r\nlessons learned during the repeated failures of the\r\nnumerous programmes, strategies and other initiatives\r\nat African development that have often come from\r\nabroad, our leaders have finally resolved to design and\r\nadopt NEPAD in order to break once and for all the\r\npersistent chains of underdevelopment that have bound\r\nour peoples. Given its generous and collective spirit,\r\nthis idea will make it possible for Africa to\r\nsuccessfully become involved in today’s globalized\r\nworld and to participate actively in world trade through\r\na considerable increase in direct foreign investment\r\nand a doubling of domestic investment.\r\nIn that connection, the delegation of Senegal\r\nwelcomes the positive response of the United Nations.\r\nIn his report entitled “Independent evaluation of the\r\nUnited Nations New Agenda for the Development of\r\nAfrica in the 1990s”, the Secretary-General identified\r\nNEPAD as the ideal framework for a partnership\r\nbetween Africa and the rest of the world. That\r\npartnership is one in which the Organization will play a\r\nleading coordinating role. Our search for synergy in\r\nthis regard will be entrusted to an adviser with special\r\nfunctions in Africa, who is yet to be named. Provided\r\nwith the necessary resources to carry out his mission\r\nappropriately, the adviser’s role should not be confined\r\nto bureaucratic tasks. Instead, the adviser should\r\nincreasingly have other responsibilities in order to be\r\nable to play a dynamic, practical and proactive role on\r\nbehalf of NEPAD. Senegal remains convinced that in\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nthat exercise, as well as in other matters, the United\r\nNations will support regional efforts to optimize results\r\nin the field through improved coordination of efforts\r\nand greater consistency in the programmes and\r\nactivities carried out locally through the various bodies\r\nof the Secretariat.\r\nIn closing, I would like to say that, as described\r\nby Secretary-General Kofi Annan — whom I\r\ncongratulate for the relevance of his report —\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union seems to be alive and well. We believe,\r\nhowever, that on closer observation, we can see that the\r\nimportant potential for cooperation and the enormous\r\nopportunities that cooperation provides have not been\r\nsufficiently explored. The structure of the Secretariat\r\nhas not yet fully integrated the new elements\r\nrepresented by NEPAD and the Constitutive Act of the\r\nAfrican Union.\r\nGiven the commendable work of the United\r\nNations Liaison Office with the Organization of\r\nAfrican Unity and the African Union at Addis Ababa,\r\nwhose dynamism we welcome, as well as the opening\r\nof subregional offices in Dakar, Nairobi and, soon,\r\nelsewhere in Africa, Senegal has no doubt whatever\r\nthat the pursuit of United Nations reform will fully\r\nmeet our expectations. On that hopeful note, I would\r\nlike to reiterate Senegal’s gratitude for the\r\nirreplaceable activities of the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) and the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion and express the fervent desire that the United\r\nNations and the African Union, together with those\r\norganizations, will work successfully to build a better\r\nworld, a world in which the digital gap will be fully\r\nclosed and the economy will be re-energized in a\r\nsustainable way, in which democracy and human rights\r\nwill be solidly established, in which pandemics will be\r\novercome and in which peace will be permanently\r\nestablished for the greater happiness of all people, even\r\nthe most marginalized and vulnerable.\r\nMay the United Nations, the African Union and\r\nother organizations, in their daily common efforts to\r\nbuild peace, together forge an exemplary partnership\r\nfor development. May they succeed in their efforts to\r\ncooperate.\r\nMr. Gross (Switzerland) (spoke in French): It is\r\nan honour and pleasure for me to speak here as a\r\nmember of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council\r\nof Europe and as a Swiss parliamentarian, one of the\r\ninitiators of the referendum on Switzerland’s joining\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI am grateful on two counts. I would like to thank\r\nthe Swiss Government for allowing me to speak\r\nwithout asking me to express its position. If you don’t\r\nagree with some of my comments, please speak to me\r\ndirectly. Also, I would like to tell you how grateful I\r\nam to the people and cantons of the Swiss\r\nConfederation. As you know, we were one of the last\r\nStates to become a Member of the United Nations. We\r\nwere also one of the first to join as an entire people.\r\nThe Swiss people took the decision to join at the urging\r\nof one of the minorities involved in offsetting the\r\nnegative result of the first vote of 1986. This was\r\nfurther proof of the old adage that the Swiss may be\r\nagainst a new idea, but that does not mean that they are\r\nagainst the idea, it just means they are not yet in favour\r\nof the new idea.\r\nYou must remember that even in your countries\r\nthings happen in the same way. If you take many\r\npeople on a train for a long and uncertain trip, it takes\r\ntime to fill up the train. But all the effort spent\r\npreparing the voyage is compensated by the greater\r\nlegitimacy, durability and knowledge gained by\r\neveryone who was involved.\r\nThis effort was worthwhile for the future of\r\nSwitzerland as well as the United Nations, because\r\nliving as a democracy means mobilizing the creativity,\r\nwealth and the intellectual potential of a people\r\ntogether in pursuit of a greater common cause.\r\nToday we are confronted with the challenge and\r\nobligation to design a structure that recognizes the\r\nvalue of democracy above and beyond the nation State,\r\nbecause the nation State alone can no longer address\r\nthe transnational existential challenges facing its\r\npeople, nor ensure respect for their human rights and\r\nsocial needs. We must remember that democracy is\r\nmuch more than simply organizing a parliamentary\r\nmajority and legitimizing power. It is a precondition\r\nfor all those who are not privileged to be able to\r\nexpress themselves, so that freedom is not limited to\r\nthe wealthy and the privileged.\r\nConsequently, today we must globalize\r\ndemocracy in order to humanize globalization. The\r\nUnited Nations will be at the forefront of this common\r\nundertaking and every region of the world may\r\ncontribute to this effort through its experiences. The\r\nCouncil of Europe, a pan-European organization of 44\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nEuropean countries, including the less privileged\r\ncountries in Europe, is an example of how\r\nparliamentarians, chosen by their national parliaments,\r\ncan become the engine for ensuring that such\r\ntransnational organization can work. This is, perhaps,\r\nan experience that the United Nations might build\r\nupon. Based upon this experience, I ask you to support\r\nthe resolution for the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which\r\nshares this perspective.\r\nSuch a parliamentary foundation that would\r\nreflect the hopes, experiences, ideas and needs of\r\npeoples, may seem a little disturbing or difficult for\r\nGovernments and diplomats. But it is certainly\r\nessential in order to enhance the legitimacy,\r\neffectiveness and the capacity of the United Nations to\r\nresolve the existential problems of peoples in the true\r\ninterests of the world.\r\nAnother experience of the Council of Europe that\r\nis worth consideration by other regional, transnational\r\nand United Nations organizations, is the authority it\r\nhas created to protect human rights effectively for the\r\nbenefit of each individual citizen, including those\r\ninjured by their State. There are also some problems\r\nfaced by both the Council of Europe and the United\r\nNations and which should be reformed collectively. In\r\nparticular, I am thinking of how these bodies are\r\nfinanced. The practices of the European Union might\r\nbe helpful in this respect. But I am also thinking of the\r\nweaknesses of these organizations with regard to the\r\npower of the world economy and the injustice it creates\r\nworldwide.\r\nI would like to remind you of what Jacques\r\nDelors suggested to the United Nations, namely that it\r\nshould establish an economic security council that\r\nwould respond to the world financial crisis and the\r\nimpoverishment of some peoples, much as our Security\r\nCouncil responds to threats to peace and security.\r\nI know these ideas might seem utopian to some of\r\nyou, but I would like to remind you that each of the\r\nsuccesses that we are proud of today, for example the\r\nUnited Nations, at one point also seemed rather\r\nutopian. If we want our children and grandchildren to\r\nbe happy and proud of their political achievements, we\r\nmust today be open and bold in looking at innovative\r\nideas.\r\nIf today you are not brave enough to imagine that\r\nwhich is supposedly impossible, we will not be able to\r\nachieve tomorrow the possible and the necessary. We\r\nmust avoid a clash of civilizations, if we seek to\r\npromote understanding.\r\nI thank you for being open and courageous, and I\r\nwould like to thank you also for having been patient\r\nenough to have listened to what may have been a rather\r\nunusual speech.\r\nMr. Koonjul (Mauritius): It gives me great\r\npleasure to participate in this meeting of the General\r\nAssembly on agenda item 22, relating to cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\norganizations. My delegation attaches great importance\r\nto this item, as it is one of the many ways through\r\nwhich the United Nations institutionalizes its\r\ncooperation with regional and other organizations.\r\nSuch cooperation leads to better understanding and\r\nhelps in strengthening the roles and effectiveness of the\r\nUnited Nations and these organizations.\r\nLet me express the great satisfaction of my\r\ndelegation with the decision taken yesterday by the\r\nGeneral Assembly to grant observer status to the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, an organization that has been\r\ncooperating with the United Nations since 1947.\r\nMy delegation would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the very comprehensive reports that he has\r\nsubmitted under this item. In our statement today, we\r\nwould like to focus on United Nations cooperation with\r\nthree organizations, namely the African Union, the\r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie (OIF)\r\nand the Southern African Development Community\r\n(SADC), of all of which Mauritius is a member. In this\r\nrespect, my delegation associates itself with the\r\nstatements made by the delegation of South Africa, on\r\nbehalf of the African Union, the delegation of\r\nLebanon, on behalf of the OIF and the delegation of\r\nAngola on behalf of SADC.\r\nWe note with satisfaction that during the year\r\nunder review, cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Organization of African Unity (OAU) — now\r\nthe African Union — has been further strengthened in\r\nseveral areas and has involved almost all the agencies\r\nof the United Nations system. We have noted in\r\nparticular the close collaboration between the two\r\norganizations in the areas of conflict prevention and\r\ndefusing tension in many parts of Africa, among others\r\nin Madagascar and the Comoros, two countries\r\nbelonging to the same region as Mauritius.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nWith the transformation of the OAU into the\r\nAfrican Union, the pan-African organization is\r\ncurrently in a transition phase and is in particular need\r\nof expertise and assistance to establish new structures\r\nand a foundation for the building of strong institutional\r\ncapacities. We are pleased that the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme is contributing strategically\r\nto the elaboration of a coherent framework for this\r\ntransition and we hope that such assistance will\r\ncontinue on a longer-term basis when the Preparatory\r\nAssistance Programme ends in January 2003.\r\nThe good relations between the United Nations\r\nand the OAU have always been characterized by\r\nfruitful cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\r\nManagement and Resolution. The prevention and\r\nresolution of conflict in Africa has always been a\r\npriority for the OAU and will remain so for the African\r\nUnion in the coming years. With the establishment of\r\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union,\r\nwe hope that the assistance which was being provided\r\nto the Central Organ of the OAU will be maintained\r\nand further strengthened. As many members are aware,\r\nAfrica has expressed its readiness to play a still greater\r\nrole in conflict prevention and resolution by\r\ncontributing African troops in the context of various\r\nconflict situations. These initiatives will require\r\nextensive support, and we invite the United Nations to\r\nhelp the African Union to build up its capacity in this\r\nregard.\r\nIn January this year, Mr. Amara Essy, Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the OAU, participated in the public Security\r\nCouncil meeting on the situation in Africa, which led\r\nto the establishment of the Ad Hoc Working Group on\r\nConflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa. That was\r\nthe first time that the Secretary-General of the OAU\r\nhad been invited to brief the Security Council on the\r\nissue of conflict relating to Africa. My delegation\r\nfirmly believes that there is merit in maintaining this\r\npractice in the future. The Ad Hoc Working Group has\r\nidentified several ways in which the African Union and\r\nthe United Nations system could cooperate in order to\r\naddress African issues.\r\nThe ownership of development policies through\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), the economic programme of the African\r\nUnion, bears testimony to the commitment and\r\ndetermination of Africa in addressing the political,\r\neconomic and social, as well as the ecological,\r\nchallenges of the continent. It is obvious, however, that\r\nthe objectives of NEPAD cannot be realized without\r\nthe assistance of international partners. The United\r\nNations system could facilitate the process of building\r\npartnerships for Africa’s development. We would like\r\nto reiterate that a United Nations system-wide\r\ncoordinating framework will have to be developed to\r\nimprove the effectiveness of United Nations support\r\nfor NEPAD.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWith regard to relations between the United\r\nNations and the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie, the report of the Secretary-General\r\nclearly indicates that, since the adoption of resolution\r\n56/45, cooperation between the two entities has been\r\nfurther strengthened.\r\nMy delegation welcomes such cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OIF, which is\r\nbased on complementarity and is mutually beneficial.\r\nIn the political domain, over and above OIF’s\r\ncontribution to conflict resolution in several African\r\nStates, in particular Burundi and the Comoros, we\r\nwelcome its decision to hold regular consultations and\r\nto exchange information and experiences in the field of\r\npreventive diplomacy and the restoration and\r\nconsolidation of peace.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the OIF’s contribution\r\nin the economic and social sphere, which has made it\r\npossible to include an Indian Ocean information\r\nmanagement component in the Small Island\r\nDeveloping States Network. With a branch in\r\nMauritius, that Network will now have a presence in\r\nthe Indian Ocean, thereby facilitating a strengthening\r\nof information capacities in the service of sustainable\r\ndevelopment in such States.\r\nWe hope that cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the OIF will be further pursued in other\r\nareas so as to promote sustained development in\r\nFrench-speaking countries.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me now turn to cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and SADC, a subregional organization\r\nto which Mauritius proudly belongs. Today, SADC is\r\nengaged not only in the consolidation and maintenance\r\nof democracy, peace and security, but also in efforts to\r\npromote sustainable development and regional\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nintegration in a broad spectrum of economic and social\r\nareas.\r\nA new wave of optimism is sweeping the SADC\r\nregion, with real prospects for peace in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and Angola. SADC as a region\r\nhas cooperated fully with the United Nations in the\r\narea of peacekeeping activities, particularly in peace\r\nprocesses in the Great Lakes region. The signing of the\r\nPretoria and Luanda Agreements demonstrate the\r\ncommitment and will of the parties to the conflict in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo to turn the page\r\nand begin a new era of peace and reconstruction. We\r\ncall on the United Nations to strengthen its presence\r\nand role in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\r\nhelp in a thorough disarmament, demobilization,\r\nreintegration and repatriation or resettlement\r\nprogramme so that peace can be durable and\r\nsustainable.\r\nIn Angola, the signing of the Ceasefire\r\nAgreement in April created unprecedented conditions\r\nfor the resolution of all pending questions relating to\r\nthe Lusaka Protocol and its full implementation after\r\nmore than three decades of war and conflict. With the\r\nend of the war, however, Angola has to face great\r\nhumanitarian challenges. It is therefore vital that the\r\ninternational community continue to assist Angola by\r\nproviding humanitarian financial and material\r\nassistance in alleviating the suffering of the Angolan\r\npeople and reintegrating UNITA in all spheres of\r\nactivities in the country. The United Nations, together\r\nwith SADC, should play an important coordinating\r\nrole.\r\nWith the progress achieved in the peace processes\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola,\r\nthe focus should now be on how to have an effective\r\ndemobilization and reintegration programme for lasting\r\npeace in those two countries and in the region as a\r\nwhole. My delegation favours a global approach to deal\r\nwith the problem of demobilization and reintegration,\r\nand we believe that subregional organizations such as\r\nSADC can play a significant role in coordinating such\r\nprogrammes.\r\nIt is also encouraging to note that in its quest for\r\npeace and stability in the SADC region, there is close\r\nongoing consultation between the United Nations\r\nDepartment for Disarmament Affairs and SADC to\r\nidentify opportunities for further cooperation in\r\naddressing the problems of small arms and light\r\nweapons and the elimination of landmines.\r\nThe SADC community is determined to continue\r\nwith its ultimate objective of building a region in\r\nwhich there will be a high degree of harmonization and\r\nrationalization. This will enable a pooling of resources\r\naimed at achieving collective self-reliance in order to\r\nimprove the living standards of the people of the\r\nregion. SADC is also encouraging its member States to\r\nincorporate a gender perspective at various decision-\r\nmaking levels. Unfortunately, these efforts are being\r\nhampered by the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and\r\nother communicable diseases, as well as by the recent\r\nadverse weather conditions, which have taken a heavy\r\ntoll on the food situation in a large number of SADC\r\ncountries. While the Secretary-General’s reports\r\nhighlight the close cooperation which exists between\r\nthe United Nations and SADC in addressing these\r\nissues, we appeal to the international community to\r\nincrease its assistance to SADC members, especially\r\nthose which are particularly affected by HIV/AIDS and\r\nthe current food shortages.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of Mauritius fully\r\nsupports the draft resolutions aimed at strengthening\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations.\r\nMr. Zhang Yishan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization (AALCO). We are pleased\r\nto see the two organizations strengthening their\r\nrelationship and expanding their areas of cooperation.\r\nAALCO is the only intergovernmental legal\r\nconsultative organization for the Asian and African\r\nregion. Since its establishment, it has dedicated itself to\r\nthe following areas: consultation and coordination on\r\nlegal matters among member States; the latest\r\ndevelopments in international law; and legal questions\r\nof common concern to Asian and African countries. It\r\nhas achieved positive results. Over the years, AALCO\r\nhas served as a forum of cooperation for countries of\r\nthe region to work on legal issues and other matters of\r\ncommon concern. Moreover, it has contributed to the\r\nprogressive development of international law and to its\r\ncodification.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nAALCO has become a regional body with unique\r\ninfluence in the legal field. We believe that that\r\ninfluence will continue to grow.\r\nSince its accreditation as an observer in the\r\nGeneral Assembly, AALCO has enjoyed ever-closer\r\ncooperation with the United Nations. Relevant United\r\nNations agencies such as the International Law\r\nCommission (ILC), the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme (UNEP), the United Nations Educational,\r\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR) are regularly represented at\r\nAALCO’s annual sessions, and their representatives\r\nregularly deliver important speeches.\r\nLikewise, AALCO also attends a variety of\r\nmeetings in the United Nations system and participates\r\nactively by making useful contributions. From the\r\noutset, it has given priority consideration to legal and\r\nother matters of concern to the United Nations. In this\r\nregard, its cooperation with the ILC stands out. Besides\r\ninviting ILC representatives to participate in its annual\r\nsessions and to speak of the work of the ILC, it has\r\nalso made the report on the work of the ILC a regular\r\nitem on its agenda, under which discussions are held\r\nand suggestions made. The Secretary General of\r\nAALCO also attends each session of the ILC and\r\nintroduces the work of the organization. The\r\ncooperation between the two organizations is fruitful\r\nand satisfactory.\r\nLast July, the forty-first annual session of\r\nAALCO was held in Abuja, Nigeria. During the\r\nsession, detailed discussions were held on many\r\nimportant issues, including the work of the ILC, the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court, the\r\ncampaign against corruption, the law of the sea,\r\nprotection of the environment, human rights, refugees,\r\nand counter-terrorism. This has enabled the members to\r\nachieve mutual understanding and engage in\r\ncooperation on those issues.\r\nChina, a member of both the United Nations and\r\nAALCO, attaches great importance to AALCO and has\r\nactively participated in and strongly supported its work\r\nsince becoming a fully fledged member in 1983. China is\r\npleased to see the ever-closer and extensive cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and AALCO. We hope that\r\nthe two organizations will further strengthen their\r\ncooperation in the promotion of the progressive\r\ndevelopment and codification of international law and\r\nother areas of common concern. This will set a good\r\nexample of a close relationship and effective cooperation\r\nbetween a global international organization and a regional\r\ninternational one in their common quest for world peace\r\nand development. The Chinese Government will\r\ncontinue to contribute to the strengthening of\r\nAALCO’s role and influence, as well as to the close\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and AALCO.\r\nMr. Aboul Gheit (Egypt), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nMr. Santa Clara Gomes (Portugal): I have the\r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the\r\nPortuguese Foreign Minister, Antonio Martins da Cruz,\r\nChairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who wished to\r\naddress this plenary on the item “Cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe”.\r\nWe view this debate, which is taking place shortly\r\nbefore the OSCE Ministerial Council, to be held in\r\nPorto on 6 and 7 December, as a very important\r\npolitical message that makes clear the importance that\r\nthe United Nations attaches to the role and the\r\ncontribution of the OSCE in the consolidation of peace\r\nand stability in its regional area of intervention.\r\nThe guiding objective of the tenure of the\r\nPortuguese chairmanship has been to ensure that the\r\nOSCE maintains its important role in the international\r\narena, both in its vocational area of preventive\r\ndiplomacy and in the new tasks resulting from the ever-\r\nchanging international security context.\r\nThe prevention of, and the fight against, terrorism\r\nhas been a central priority of our chairmanship, with\r\nthe objective of promoting the valuable contribution of\r\nthe OSCE, namely through the Bucharest Plan of\r\nAction and the Bishkek Programme of Action, in the\r\ncontext of the international strategy led by the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt is in this context that we organized in Lisbon,\r\non 12 June, the first Conference of Secretaries-General\r\nand High Representatives of the main international and\r\nregional organizations involved in the fight against\r\nterrorism. We hope to see a follow-up to this\r\nConference next year, and we have already offered to\r\nhost such a meeting in Portugal.\r\nWe have also been working towards the\r\nelaboration of an OSCE Charter for the Prevention and\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nthe Fight against Terrorism. This political document,\r\nwhich we hope to see adopted at the Porto Ministerial\r\nmeeting, will reaffirm the core, lasting and timeless\r\nvalues and norms guiding OSCE action.\r\nAnother concrete example of the OSCE’s vitality\r\nwill be the adoption in Porto of a decision containing\r\nclear guidelines for the elaboration of an OSCE\r\nstrategy to address threats to security and stability in\r\nthe twenty-first century. This strategy will not only\r\nallow the identification of a list of threats and\r\nchallenges but also make it possible to elaborate a new\r\noperational approach for the OSCE to address such\r\nrisks. We are all aware of the new difficulties and\r\nthreats facing our individual and collective security,\r\nbut no organization is capable of tackling them on its\r\nown. The reinforcement of the cooperation and\r\ncoordination between all international and regional\r\norganizations has particular relevance in our globalized\r\nworld where the concept of indivisible security is more\r\npalpable than ever to our citizens.\r\nIt is in this spirit that the Portuguese\r\nChairmanship of the OSCE has been promoting the\r\noperational concept of the Platform for Cooperative\r\nSecurity, adopted at the OSCE Istanbul Summit in\r\n1999, with a view to developing modalities of dialogue\r\nand collaboration between the OSCE and other\r\ninternational organizations, both at the headquarters\r\nlevel and on the ground.\r\nAs a regional arrangement under Chapter VIII of\r\nthe United Nations Charter, the OSCE has been able to\r\ndevelop, over the years, a very close and fruitful\r\npartnership with the United Nations in a number of key\r\nsecurity related areas.\r\nConflict prevention appears at the forefront of the\r\ncommon efforts undertaken by both organizations. The\r\nprevention of conflicts is a core component of the\r\nOSCE’s activities and a very important field within\r\nwhich to foster cooperation among international and\r\nregional organizations. We need indeed to promote a\r\ncommon culture of prevention, following up the\r\ndialogue on peace-building initiated by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan. In this context, we welcome the\r\ninitiative of the Regional European Union Conference\r\non Conflict Prevention, which took place last August in\r\nHelsingborg and where Minister Martins da Cruz\r\nparticipated as OSCE Chairman-in-Office.\r\nThe OSCE’s continued relevance is not only due\r\nto its broad membership, as the only political forum\r\nthat is simultaneously Pan-European, Euro-Atlantic and\r\nEuro-Asiatic, but also to its unique and comprehensive\r\nconcept of security, based on three dimensions: human,\r\npolitical-military and economic-environmental. It is in\r\nthe framework of these dimensions that the OSCE and\r\nthe United Nations have been working together in\r\nconcrete and pragmatic terms. Concerning the human\r\ndimension, the Portuguese Chairmanship would like to\r\npraise the active participation of a number of high-level\r\nrepresentatives from the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and the United\r\nNations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention\r\n(UNDCCP) in the Annual Implementation Assessment\r\nMeeting which took place in Warsaw last September.\r\nThis meeting paved the way for the preparation of\r\nrelevant documents for the Porto Ministerial Council\r\nMeeting on trafficking in human beings, tolerance and\r\nelectoral standards. We would also like to underline the\r\nclose cooperation and exchange of information\r\nbetween the OSCE and UNHCR regarding refugees\r\nand statelessness.\r\nIn the economic and environmental dimension,\r\nthe Portuguese Chairmanship would like to thank\r\nUNESCO, the United Nations Economic Commission\r\nfor Europe (ECE) and the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme for their valuable support during this year’s\r\nOSCE Economic Forum, which took place in Prague in\r\nMay, on the theme of cooperation for the sustainable\r\nuse and the protection of the quality of water. We hope\r\nthat the recommendations which were adopted will\r\ncontribute to the efforts of the United Nations in\r\nmaking the 21st century one of “water peace”.\r\nIn the political-military dimension, continued\r\nefforts have been undertaken by the OSCE in the field\r\nof small arms and light weapons. This is an important\r\narea of complementarity and synergy between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE. We would are also\r\nconsidering the possibility this year for the OSCE to\r\nparticipate in or carry out peacekeeping operations.\r\nThis needs to be pursued in close consultation with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTurning now to cooperation on the ground, we\r\nhave witnessed, in different regions throughout this\r\nyear, the continuous development of mutually\r\nreinforcing efforts between the United Nations and the\r\nOSCE. In South-Eastern Europe, this cooperation is\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nsolid and provides concrete results. Throughout the\r\nregion, the OSCE and the United Nations mutually\r\nsupport their daily activities in the field.\r\nIn Kosovo, where this cooperation is more\r\nevident at an a institutional level, both organizations\r\nwork together in the implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1244 (1999). The OSCE has proven\r\nto be an essential part of the United Nations Mission in\r\nKosovo, where it has played a substantial role in\r\npreparing and organizing elections. The recent municipal\r\npoll is a good example of how the OSCE continues to\r\nconsolidate stability in the province and to gradually\r\nhand over autonomy. The OSCE also remains committed\r\nin training a multi-ethnic police service, building\r\ndemocratic institutions and promoting human rights.\r\nIn Moldova, some important developments took\r\nplace this year in the political process. Negotiations\r\nbetween the two parties and the three mediators\r\nresumed after a long period of inaction. The parties\r\nagreed to discuss a proposal presented by the mediators\r\non the future political role of Trans-Dniester, in what\r\nrepresents a step ahead towards a solution to this\r\nconflict. On the fulfilment of the Istanbul commitments\r\nby the Russian Federation, some progress was achieved\r\nand we look forward to the completion of this process.\r\nRegarding Belarus, the relationship of the OSCE\r\nwith this country has been at the centre of discussions\r\nduring the current year, especially through the role of\r\nthe field mission in Minsk. The OSCE Chair has\r\nengaged in serious consultations with the Government\r\nof Belarus, with a view to solving the current deadlock\r\nas soon as possible, and discussions are currently under\r\nway in Vienna.\r\nIn Georgia, OSCE activities are particularly\r\nchallenging. With regard to the South Ossetian\r\nnegotiating process, the Portuguese Chairmanship\r\nhosted in Castelo Branco, last October, the eighth\r\nmeeting of the experts group on political issues. The\r\nprotocol that was signed represents a positive step in\r\nthe resolution of this conflict in the Caucasus, ensuring\r\nthe continuity of the momentum of the process.\r\nConcerning Abkhazia, the OSCE Chair followed\r\nwith the utmost attention the development of events\r\nand supported the efforts of the United Nations in the\r\npeace process.\r\nRegarding Central Asia, the Portuguese\r\nChairmanship praises the efforts undertaken by the\r\nOSCE and the United Nations to strengthen their\r\ncooperation. We would like in particular to emphasize\r\nthe good collaboration between the OSCE Missions in\r\nCentral Asia, particularly in Tajikistan, with certain\r\nUnited Nations agencies such as the UNDCCP in\r\ncombating drug trafficking and the UNHCR in dealing\r\nwith the increasing problem of refugees. I would also\r\nlike to stress the excellent cooperation between the\r\nOSCE and the ECE, which have worked together under\r\nmany projects of the United Nations Special\r\nProgramme for the Economies of Central Asia.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming the conviction of\r\nthe Portuguese Chairmanship of the OSCE that the\r\ncurrent General Assembly debate will lead to the\r\nadoption of the annual resolution on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OSCE, which will\r\nbe taking into account, where need be, the outcome of\r\nthe Porto Ministerial Council Meeting. The Portuguese\r\nPermanent Mission intends to begin consultations and\r\ndiscussions on the draft resolutions during the coming\r\nweek in New York. We count on the support of all\r\ndelegations in this endeavour.\r\nMr. Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia): At the outset, I\r\nwish to join previous speakers in expressing my\r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General for\r\nthe preparation of the reports on the agenda item under\r\nconsideration.\r\nMongolia attaches great importance to\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and other\r\ninternational organizations. The relevance of regional\r\norganizations in strengthening international peace and\r\nsecurity, in conflict prevention and in promoting\r\nmutual understanding and cooperation and so on is\r\nundeniable, as such organizations are uniquely placed\r\nto deal with region-specific issues and problems by\r\nproviding the necessary expertise to complement the\r\nexpertise of the United Nations. The reports of the\r\nSecretary-General demonstrate that the United Nations\r\ncontinues to make considerable progress in deepening\r\nand expanding its relations with regional and other\r\ninternational organizations on a mutually beneficial basis.\r\nBearing in mind the time factor, and the fact that\r\nmany delegations have already spoken at length on\r\nUnited Nations cooperation with other organizations, I\r\nshall focus on the Organization’s cooperation with two\r\norganizations, namely, the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\n(IPU) and the Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization (AALCO).\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on cooperation between\r\nUnited Nations and the IPU (A/57/375) is broad-\r\nranging and substantive. I share the view expressed by\r\nthe Secretary-General that the parliamentary voice,\r\nwhich is the voice of the people, must be an integral\r\ncomponent of the work of the United Nations.\r\nAlthough these two bodies have organizational and\r\nstructural differences, the relevant report demonstrates\r\nthat they are able to cooperate fruitfully. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report deals with the contribution of\r\nparliaments to major United Nations events, including\r\nto multilateral negotiations, the special session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly on children, the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development, the Commission on Human\r\nRights and so on. It covers almost every area of United\r\nNations activities.\r\nCooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nIPU began as far back as 1947. That cooperation was\r\nfurther developed with the signing of the cooperation\r\nagreement, in 1996. The inclusion of the issue of\r\ncooperation between the two organizations as an item\r\nfor consideration at General Assembly sessions since\r\n2001 is a demonstration of the collaborative spirit of\r\nboth the United Nations and the IPU.\r\nAs evidenced by the report, the two organizations\r\nshare common goals, agendas and concerns, namely,\r\nstrengthening international peace and security, ensuring\r\nsupport for human rights, encouraging and supporting\r\ndemocratic changes, promoting sustainable development,\r\nreducing poverty and ensuring social progress. We\r\nconcur with the view that parliaments and the IPU can\r\nserve as a bridge between the global and the local.\r\nWhile addressing the question of cooperation, we\r\nneed to focus on the comparative advantages of the two\r\norganizations and on a rational division of labour. The\r\nIPU could therefore serve to raise parliamentary\r\nawareness and to promote support for the work of the\r\nUnited Nations in national parliaments, thereby helping\r\nGovernments. One other area of fruitful cooperation\r\ncould be the conduct of genuinely democratic\r\nelections. Another important area lies in promoting\r\ndemocracy and strengthening human rights,\r\nrepresentative democratic institutions and the rule of\r\nlaw. For example, the IPU has agreed to make its\r\ncontribution to the Fifth International Conference of\r\nNew or Restored Democracies, which is scheduled to\r\nbe held Mongolia in June of next year. The main theme\r\nof the conference will be to promote good governance\r\nand strengthen the role of civil society.\r\nAs the legislative bodies of States, parliaments\r\ncan play an important role in strengthening\r\ninternational law, especially by promoting its\r\nprogressive codification and speedily ratifying and\r\nuniversalizing basic international treaties — including\r\nthose dealing with human rights, terrorism, arms\r\ncontrol and environmental protection — and, equally\r\nimportant, by ensuring their full implementation.\r\nWe welcome the input of the IPU with regard to\r\nthe successful holding of the Millennium Summit\r\nthrough the contribution of the first-ever Conference of\r\nPresiding Officers of National Parliaments. We also\r\nexpect the IPU and national parliaments to be\r\ninstrumental in achieving the Millennium Development\r\nGoals in the agreed time frame.\r\nMongolia is proud to serve on the executive body\r\nof the IPU. Bearing in mind the constructive role that\r\nthe IPU can play in promoting the goals of the United\r\nNations, my delegation has joined in sponsoring draft\r\nresolution A/57/L.38, which is before the Assembly.\r\nWe support the recommendation that the IPU be given\r\nboth a standing invitation to observe the work of the\r\nUnited Nations and the right to circulate documents in\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nTurning to AALCO, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress its satisfaction with the growing cooperation of\r\nthat body with the United Nations since 1980. Through\r\nits programmes, AALCO is very effectively\r\ncontributing to strengthening the role of the United\r\nNations and its various organs, including the\r\nInternational Court of Justice. The Asian-African Legal\r\nConsultative Organization continues to orient its work\r\nprogramme towards priority areas of the United\r\nNations, for which my delegation is grateful.\r\nAALCO has left its imprint on the largest\r\nprogressive codification process of the past century:\r\nthe codification of the law of the sea. That fact will\r\nnext month enable us to mark the twentieth anniversary\r\nof the signing of the Montego Bay Convention, which\r\nregulates almost two thirds of the Earth’s surface.\r\nSince the Convention’s entry into force, AALCO has\r\nbeen closely monitoring the work and functioning of\r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and\r\nthe International Seabed Authority.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nIn the 1990s, AALCO actively participated in the\r\nprogrammes of the United Nations Decade of\r\nInternational Law, in programmes on the environment\r\nand sustainable development and in helping delegations\r\nto prepare for negotiations on the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. Bearing in mind that\r\nmany States have still not yet ratified or acceded to the\r\nRome Statute, my delegation believes that AALCO\r\ncould play an important supporting role in the efforts to\r\nspeed up ratification processes, perhaps by focusing on\r\nareas of possible concern to States and producing its\r\nwell-known notes and comments. Likewise, it could be\r\ninstrumental in promoting the objectives and principles\r\nset out in the Millennium Declaration by promoting\r\nwider acceptance of multilateral treaties deposited with\r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nApart from the field of international law, my\r\ndelegation would like to commend the fact that the\r\nAALCO is also active, among other things, in the fields\r\nof international economic cooperation, the fight against\r\ncorruption, the environment, refugees, the protection of\r\nmigrant workers and the promotion of human rights.\r\nWe wish AALCO further success in promoting the goals\r\nof the United Nations. It is for that reason that Mongolia\r\nhas become a sponsor of draft resolution A/57/L.18.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to\r\nexpress the hope that the United Nations will further\r\ndeepen and expand its mutually beneficial cooperation\r\nwith other international organizations. We hope that its\r\ncooperation with regional organizations will soon be\r\nexpanded to include the Regional Forum of the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations, and that\r\ncooperation with international legal bodies will include\r\nthe International Criminal Court.\r\nMs. Pulido Santana (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): This intervention in the debate will focus on\r\nagenda item 22 (h), on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela would like to\r\nexpress its satisfaction that the item on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU was included\r\non the agendas of the Sixth Committee and the General\r\nAssembly, because of the great significance that our\r\ncountry attributes to the work of parliamentarians as\r\nrepresentatives of the popular will and to their positive\r\ninfluence on international relations.\r\nVenezuela’s support for the work of\r\nparliamentarians is reaffirmed by the inclusion of\r\nmembers of our legislative body as members in\r\nVenezuelan delegations. On this occasion, we are\r\npleased to highlight the presence of Venezuelan\r\nparliamentarians — including the President of the\r\nAndean Parliament, Deputy Jhannette Madriz Sotillo,\r\nand the Secretary-General of the Latin American\r\nParliament, Deputy Rafael Correa Flores — to consider\r\nthis item in plenary meeting. Our delegation believes\r\nthat Venezuelan parliamentarians impart a special\r\ndynamic to the consideration of many of the items on\r\nthe Assembly’s agenda, which in turn enables us to\r\nfocus on those multilateral issues in a more integral\r\nway.\r\nIn addition, I should like to highlight as relevant\r\nthe fact that, of the five Associate Members of the IPU,\r\nthree are parliamentary organizations belonging to the\r\nLatin American region: the Latin American Parliament,\r\nthe Andean Parliament and the Central American\r\nParliament. The participation of those organizations in\r\nthe IPU attests to its importance for our region and to\r\nthe contribution of regional and subregional\r\nparliamentarians to the fulfilment of its purposes,\r\nespecially the attainment of international peace and\r\nstability.\r\nIn this era of change, both in the international\r\nsystem and in the United Nations, new actors must be\r\ninvolved in order to make development and the results\r\nof peace and international cooperation more effective.\r\nThe valuable contributions that the IPU has made and\r\ncontinues to make in that area, particularly in fostering\r\npeace and democracy, are undeniable. In that regard,\r\nwe thank the Secretary-General for submitting his\r\nreport, contained in document A/57/375, in which he\r\ndescribes the broad cooperation between the IPU and\r\nthe United Nations over the past year. The report\r\nhighlights the contribution of the parliamentary\r\ndimension to United Nations activities, especially in\r\nconflict prevention.\r\nUndoubtedly, parliamentary diplomacy has\r\ncontributed and continues to contribute to the\r\nprevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes, by\r\nvirtue of the positive impact of the international\r\nmeasures, contacts and relations that, because of their\r\nflexible nature, can be carried out by Parliaments.\r\nSimilarly, the compliance of States with the norms of\r\ninternational law is strengthened through the IPU’s\r\nvaluable support for the United Nations by ensuring,\r\nthrough national Parliaments, the conformity of\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nnational legal decisions with the international legal\r\nframework.\r\nBy expressing the popular will, elected\r\nparliamentarians also echo the international will of\r\ntheir peoples. In addition, they promote the fulfilment\r\nof the rights and freedoms of peoples, contribute to the\r\nattainment of peace and stability, and provide\r\nmonitoring and follow-up with regard to\r\nintergovernmental actions of interest to countries’\r\nforeign policies.\r\nAs we pointed out during the fifty-sixth session\r\nof the General Assembly and less than two months ago\r\nduring the Sixth Committee debate on this item,\r\nVenezuela believes that the relations between the\r\nOrganization and the IPU must be duly strengthened\r\nand formalized. Therefore, we are pleased to join the\r\nconsensus on the adoption of the draft resolution in the\r\nCommittee and in the General Assembly. In addition,\r\nwe welcome the consensus reached on the distribution\r\nof official United Nations documents without financial\r\nimplications for the Organization. We also support the\r\ndraft resolution in the hope that it will be adopted by\r\nconsensus in the Assembly.\r\nMr. Fonseca (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\ndebate on cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations is always a special\r\nopportunity to explore synergies among international\r\norganizations, to share experiences and thus to\r\nstrengthen practices that encourage greater\r\nunderstanding among peoples. In that regard, I should\r\nlike to cite the example provided by cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU), which, since its\r\nestablishment more than 100 years ago, has promoted\r\ndialogue among parliaments of various nations.\r\nThe delegation of Brazil welcomes the decision\r\nby Member States to grant General Assembly observer\r\nstatus to the Union. That distinction recognizes not\r\nonly the institution’s unique nature, but also its historic\r\nactivities to bring national Parliaments and the United\r\nNations — which is the world Parliament — closer\r\ntogether. The entity’s new status is also an effective\r\nstimulus for closer cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the IPU, as expressed in resolution 54/12,\r\nwhich recognizes the potential of collaboration\r\nbetween the two bodies, and in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General on this item (A/57/375).\r\nCooperation of the United Nations and its\r\nsubsidiary organs with the IPU can be brought about in\r\ntwo ways: through the Union’s active participation in\r\nUnited Nations debates and through the dissemination\r\nof the international agenda at the domestic level. In\r\nthat way, the parliamentary component of States will\r\ntake an active part in debates on today’s great issues. In\r\naddition, the Union’s contribution will enhance\r\nunderstanding of the items on the United Nations\r\nagenda and will enable parliamentarians to assess the\r\nvarious aspects of the Organization’s work. In Brazil’s\r\ncase, for many years now, parliamentarians have been\r\ninvolved in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and we are\r\nhappy to see that, increasingly, debates in the General\r\nAssembly and those in our parliaments are in tune with\r\none another.\r\nThe second way in which the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion can cooperate with the United Nations is with\r\nrespect to the dissemination among our national\r\nparliaments of information on major issues on the\r\ninternational agenda. This promotes the communication\r\nof the outcome of deliberations in the General\r\nAssembly, and its implementation at the national level.\r\nOften, parliaments have the task of transforming\r\nUnited Nations decisions into national policies. In that\r\ncontext, I would like to welcome the decision of the\r\n107th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,\r\nheld in Marrakech, Morocco, in March this year, which\r\nIt stressed the importance of national parliaments in\r\nmonitoring and implementing decisions taken by\r\nmultilateral organizations.\r\nBrazil expresses its support for efforts to\r\nstrengthen cooperation between the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion and the United Nations, such as those proposed\r\nin the Secretary-General’s report. I am confident that\r\ngranting observer status to the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion will make the work of that organization even\r\nmore productive and effective and will contribute\r\noverall to invigorating its pursuit of its objectives and\r\nof the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Laotegguelnodji (Chad) (spoke in French):\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement made\r\non behalf of the members of the Economic Community\r\nof Central African States (ECCAS) by the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of the Republic of the Congo. We trust\r\nthat draft resolution A/57/L.25, on cooperation\r\nbetween ECCAS and the United Nations, will be\r\nadopted by consensus.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nHowever, allow me to mention some aspects of\r\ninternational cooperation and regional cooperation that,\r\nin the view of my delegation, are very important. Given\r\nits geographical location, my country, Chad, is at the\r\nheart of African cultures and civilizations and is thus\r\ncalled upon to participate in cooperation at the\r\ninternational, regional and subregional levels. My\r\ndelegation therefore truly appreciates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s initiative of holding a wide-ranging debate\r\non cooperation between the United Nations and various\r\nregional-cooperation organizations. And it could not be\r\notherwise, as the United Nations is the keystone of all\r\ncooperation among its Member States.\r\nCooperation is a major focus of my Government’s\r\npolicies. Stressing that political will, my country’s\r\nauthorities took the decision to make the Ministry for\r\nForeign Affairs the ministry responsible for African\r\ncooperation policy. The result is the newly-named\r\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs and African Integration.\r\nThis desire for cooperation has led our country to join\r\nmany regional organizations, some of whose\r\nheadquarters are located in Chad.\r\nI welcome the fact that my country is a member\r\nof many of the organizations for cooperation\r\nmentioned in the Secretary-General’s reports. My\r\ndelegation therefore hopes that United Nations\r\ncooperation with the African Union will have a\r\npositive impact on other multisectoral organizations for\r\neconomic integration, such as ECCAS, the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States, the Arab Maghreb\r\nUnion, the Community of Sahelo-Saharan States and\r\nthe Southern Africa Development Community. Those\r\norganizations are the pillars of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) and must establish\r\nlinks of cooperation among themselves, with the\r\nassistance of the United Nations.\r\nIn short, we have to create horizontal ties of intra-\r\nAfrican cooperation and vertical ties of cooperation\r\nbetween African regional organizations and those\r\nbringing together other developing countries,\r\nespecially those in the Americas and Asia. Is not Africa\r\npresent on those continents? Today, Africa is a like a\r\nbroken vessel, and it needs the help of all its children\r\npast and present to tend its many wounds.\r\nToday’s debate is therefore very useful. It must\r\nalso become more focused, targeting those areas of\r\ncooperation that are most promising and which can be\r\nmechanisms to help us combat poverty. Where exactly\r\nis poverty? It is very real in the countries of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. That is why, while commending\r\nNorth-South cooperation, which must continue to be\r\nstrengthened, my delegation believes that South-South\r\ncooperation must also be encouraged and further\r\nstrengthened. There is a folk saying that two poor\r\npeople do not make a rich person. But the two poor\r\npeople can certainly think together about the conditions\r\nof their poverty and seek ways to escape it.\r\nThe structures of the economies of the countries\r\nof the South are comparable in many respects. Those\r\ncountries possess experience and technology adapted to\r\ntheir development situation. In that context, my\r\ncountry notes with satisfaction that it is thanks to a\r\ncountry of the South, a member of Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations, that we have been able to\r\nfinalize our petroleum project, which is currently under\r\nconstruction.\r\nIt is a paradox that the countries of the South are\r\npoor, as they have an enormous reserve of raw\r\nmaterials and human resources to offer in their\r\nrelationships of cooperation with countries of the\r\nNorth. Can countries of the South not do the same in\r\ntheir relations with other countries of the South? That\r\nis the question I ask.\r\nMr. Sriwidjaja (Indonesia): It is with pleasure\r\nthat my delegation is participating in the current\r\ndeliberations of the General Assembly on agenda item\r\n22, “Cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations”. We have witnessed\r\nthe intensification of the cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations that began\r\nseveral years ago, and which has continued to develop.\r\nBetter prospects have emerged for substantive progress\r\ntowards solutions to many regional problems long\r\nconsidered to be intractable. In that context, fruitful\r\ncooperation has been established between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations which have acted as\r\npartners in facilitating the peaceful resolution of\r\nnumerous conflicts.\r\nRegional organizations can play an increasingly\r\nactive role in resolving disputes, as they have the\r\ngreatest stake in their peaceful settlement. For\r\ngeographical, historical and other reasons, they are\r\nuniquely placed to propose solutions to local conflicts.\r\nThey understand their complexities and can mediate\r\nimpartially. Their involvement can also lead to greater\r\nparticipation in the international system.\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\nThe partnership between the United Nations\r\nsystem and regional organizations should grow closer\r\nin the years to come, especially in the areas of working\r\nfor peace, the rule of law, human rights, education,\r\nsocio-economic development and the transfer of new\r\ninformation and communication technologies. We\r\nbelieve that further studies should be undertaken on the\r\nmodalities for cooperation in these and other areas,\r\nwithin the framework of Chapter VIII of the Charter\r\nand in the emerging context of inter-multilateralism.\r\nLet me now turn my attention to some specific\r\naspects of cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement\r\ndelivered by the representative of Cambodia on behalf\r\nof the Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN). In that regard, we express our support for\r\nthe draft resolution on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and ASEAN (A/57/L.16). It is our hope that it\r\nwill be adopted by consensus.\r\nLikewise, Indonesia attaches special importance\r\nto cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nPacific Islands Forum. That importance is derived in\r\npart from our active participation in the Forum as a\r\npost-Forum dialogue partner. We fully support that\r\ncooperation, and we are pleased to be among the\r\nsponsors of the draft resolution on this matter\r\n(A/57/L.21).\r\nAs regards cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), we\r\nendorse the decision (resolution 57/32) taken on the\r\nrecommendation of the Sixth Committee to accord\r\nobserver status to the IPU. We are a sponsor of the\r\ndraft resolution on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the IPU (A/57/L.38). In our view, that\r\ndecision marks an important landmark in the growing\r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the IPU. It\r\nwill facilitate the task of the two organizations to seek\r\ncollective solutions to emerging problems facing the\r\ninternational community and to creating a better world\r\nfor all of humankind on the basis of the principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nAs far as cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\r\n(CTBTO) is concerned, our delegation is particularly\r\nencouraged by the momentum that has developed in\r\nbuilding the global infrastructure for verification,\r\nwhich is an important component of the Treaty in\r\nensuring compliance with its provisions prohibiting\r\nnuclear tests in the atmosphere, underground and under\r\nwater. That regime is also expected to bring scientific\r\nand technical benefits to developing countries.\r\nThe level and pace of signatures and ratifications\r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\r\n(CTBT) epitomize the international community’s\r\nstrong support for the Treaty. Although the Treaty has\r\nnot come into force since it was opened for signature\r\nsix years ago, it is nonetheless heartening to witness\r\nthe increasing number of ratifying countries, which\r\nnow stands at 97. We realize the importance of\r\ncontinuing efforts towards the early ratification of the\r\nCTBT and of reaffirming the confidence of States in\r\nthe Treaty, which is a major instrument for non-\r\nproliferation and nuclear disarmament. The 2001\r\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the\r\nTreaty encouraged the Preparatory Commission and the\r\nSecretary-General to support mutual efforts to seek\r\nfurther adherence by the States concerned.\r\nAware both of our responsibility as a country\r\nlisted in annex 2 of the Treaty and of the importance of\r\nsustained progress towards ratification, Indonesia will\r\ncontinue to make concerted efforts to expedite the\r\nprocess of ratification, which is still under way.\r\nIndonesia is among the countries that lack the\r\ntechnological wherewithal to monitor nuclear tests or\r\nto verify the Treaty’s implementation. We have\r\ntherefore placed our confidence in the integrity and\r\nreliability of the future CTBTO as a multilateral\r\nmechanism to ensure compliance with the Treaty’s\r\nprovisions. Indonesia also supports the initiative being\r\ncoordinated by Mexico to convene the Third\r\nConference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the\r\nCTBT in 2003, so as to maintain the momentum in\r\nbuilding the verification regime and to safeguard the\r\nobjectives of the Treaty. We are hopeful that the\r\nConference will include high-level attendance by\r\nStates that have signed or ratified the Treaty.\r\nWe wish to encourage further outreach activities\r\nby the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory\r\nCommission through diplomacy, as well as other\r\nendeavours to maintain and secure additional support\r\nin establishing a global verification regime.\r\nWe would also like to welcome the Joint\r\nMinisterial Statement in support of the CTBT that was\r\nadopted during this session of the General Assembly,\r\non 14 September 2002, and that has been endorsed by\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.54\r\n50 Foreign Ministers (see A/57/586). In our view, the\r\ncontent and spirit of that statement will add impetus to\r\nthe international norm against nuclear testing, and\r\nthereby to the cause of non-proliferation and nuclear\r\ndisarmament.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement, let me express\r\nthe hope that, pending the coming into force of the\r\nTreaty, the interaction between the United Nations and\r\nthe Preparatory Commission, as embodied in the\r\nagreement signed in 2000, will continue to grow. Such\r\ninteraction and coordination can be sustained in areas\r\nof common interest and should develop fruitfully to the\r\nmutual benefit of both the United Nations and the\r\nPreparatory Commission. In that way, the Commission\r\ncan profit from experience and insights derived from\r\nthe United Nations. That, in turn, will contribute to the\r\nwork of the Commission. Indonesia looks forward to\r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the two\r\norganizations, and to working jointly towards the\r\ncommon objective of achieving a comprehensive and\r\nverifiable ban on nuclear testing for all time and in all\r\nenvironments.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I shall\r\nnow call on those representatives who wish to speak in\r\nexercise of the right to reply.\r\nMr. Shacham (Israel): I must, regrettably, ask the\r\nindulgence of the General Assembly in order to\r\nrespond to comments made earlier this afternoon by the\r\nrepresentative of Egypt.\r\nIt is unfortunate that in the discussion of an issue\r\ndear to us all — cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations — the\r\ndelegation of Egypt found it necessary to voice an\r\nextraneous and irrelevant attack against my country.\r\nThat behaviour is even more puzzling in the light of the\r\nfact that today, throughout Israel, ceremonies and\r\nevents are being held to mark the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the late Egyptian President Sadat’s\r\ncourageous visit to our country and the launching of\r\nnegotiations that led to the first peace treaty between\r\nIsrael and an Arab State.\r\nIt is hard to think of an agenda item more\r\ndedicated to multilateralism than the item under\r\nconsideration, which praises cooperation over\r\ndivisiveness. Why, then, did it become imperative for\r\nthe Egyptian speaker to single out Israel for a scathing,\r\nand even inaccurate, politically motivated sideswipe?\r\nThat, unfortunately, is far from an uncommon\r\noccurrence. Time and again, in the plenary General\r\nAssembly and in the Assembly’s various committees,\r\nEgyptian speakers have singled out Israel for attack\r\nand denigration in statements on universal agenda\r\nitems that have nothing to do with the Middle East.\r\nMy delegation could have also taken the floor in\r\norder, perhaps, to call upon the world’s\r\nparliamentarians to join together in protest over the\r\nlack of legislative power of the rubber-stamp Egyptian\r\nParliament, or perhaps to protest the authoritarian\r\nregime in Egypt, which consistently violates the human\r\nrights of religious and ethnic minorities, homosexuals\r\nand women. But we chose not to do so.\r\nSeeing the attitude of Egypt’s representatives at\r\nthe United Nations and that of its Government at home,\r\nthe people of Israel ask themselves, “Where is the\r\npeace?” We were promised land for peace, so we\r\nwithdrew from the entire Sinai peninsula. And yet, we\r\nreceived only hatred and animosity. We were promised\r\nland for peace, so we offered far-reaching withdrawal\r\nfrom the West Bank and Gaza. Yet, we received in\r\nreturn a ruthless campaign of terrorism that has left\r\nnearly 700 Israelis dead and thousands wounded.\r\nWhile Israel appreciates the fact that peace\r\nofficially exists between us, I ask my Egyptian\r\ncolleagues to consider how this kind of behaviour\r\ninfluences the Israeli people, who nurture the hopes\r\nand promises of peace, yet see that in return for\r\ncomprehensive concessions they get only rejection,\r\nhatred and violence.\r\n Mr. Atta (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): We are\r\nsurprised at the comments of the representative of\r\nIsrael. We merely cited irrefutable facts about the daily\r\nexperiences of those living in the occupied territories.\r\nA policy of closures, imposed by the Israeli occupying\r\nforces, has been in force for the past two years.\r\nFurthermore, a travel ban is in operation every day that\r\nprevents Palestinian parliamentarians from moving\r\nabout within the Palestinian territory. Israel’s policy of\r\ndestroying Palestinian civil institutions is another fact.\r\nFinally, the representative of Israel referred to\r\ntrue democracy. A true democracy does not occupy the\r\nterritory or usurp the rights of others, as Israel has been\r\ndoing for half a century. The Israeli representative\r\nshould be ashamed that the Israeli State is the only\r\nState in the twenty-first century that is engaged in\r\nmilitary occupation of another people’s territory.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
