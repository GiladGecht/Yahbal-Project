The information provided by the\r\nSecretary-General in his report (document A/57/267)\r\nindicates that in Haiti the United Nations has continued\r\nto provide support for the OAS Special Mission for\r\nStrengthening Democracy in Haiti, and to participate in\r\nmeetings of the Group of Friends. Similarly, in\r\nGuatemala, cooperation has continued between the\r\nUnited Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala\r\n(MINUGUA) and various representatives of the OAS.\r\nThe exchange of information between the two\r\norganizations concerning the general trend on the\r\ncontinent has also been substantial and has covered the\r\nrecent crises in various countries of the region,\r\nincluding my own. We understand that existing\r\ndialogue and cooperation need to be strengthened and\r\nbroadened. The OAS plays a vital role in the\r\nhemisphere in defending democracy and protecting\r\nhuman rights. Its knowledge of regional problems puts\r\nit in the best position to enable the United Nations to\r\nbenefit by its experience and capacity on issues of\r\ncommon interest.\r\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human\r\nRights, which has a very good reputation in the region,\r\nneeds to achieve better coordination with the universal\r\nhuman rights treaty bodies. It is also desirable for that\r\ncooperation to be extended to the special rapporteurs of\r\nthe United Nations Commission of Human Rights.\r\nSuch coordination and harmonization of their\r\nrespective activities, which is beginning to happen\r\nthrough the channel of the Office of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, will always\r\nredound to the benefit of strengthening the protection\r\nof human rights in the region.\r\nAnother propitious area for cooperation, in our\r\nview, is the economic and social sphere. The report\r\nnotes the existence of various levels of exchange\r\nbetween the OAS and the United Nations Conference\r\non Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the OAS\r\nand the Economic Commission for Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean (ECLAC). Such cooperation could be\r\nexpanded to other areas in order to unify the efforts of\r\nthe various organizations to promote the attainment of\r\nthe Millennium Goals on the continent, in particular in\r\nthe areas of development and poverty eradication.\r\nMy country also values the diversification of the\r\ncooperation between the Latin American Economic\r\nSystem and the United Nations. We hope that these\r\nactivities, and particularly those involving the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), the United\r\nNations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), UNCTAD, the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO) and the World Health\r\nOrganization (WHO) will be deepened and\r\nstrengthened, which would also benefit the region’s\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Argentine delegation welcomes the adoption\r\nby this General Assembly of resolution 57/32, which\r\ninvites the Inter-Parliamentary Union to participate in\r\nthe work of the General Assembly as an observer. We\r\ntake the view that this historic event is a rightful\r\nrecognition of the work done by the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union, which aims at ensuring that\r\nparliamentarians the world over commit themselves to\r\nthe activities of the international community in areas\r\nsuch as peace and security, human rights, economic and\r\nsocial development, democracy and gender issues.\r\nWe wish to express our profound satisfaction at\r\nthe election of Senator Sergio Páez Verdugo of Chile as\r\nPresident of the Inter-Parliamentary Council. Argentina\r\ntakes genuine pride in seeing Senator Páez conducting\r\nthe work of the Union, and we wish him every success.\r\nIn the course of the past year, we have noted the\r\ngrowing cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union. Parliamentarians from\r\nall around the world have participated in parallel events\r\nduring important United Nations meetings. Also,\r\nthrough the IPU, parliamentarians have shown greater\r\ninterest in attending the general debate of the General\r\nAssembly and the deliberations of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights in Geneva. Here, the annual meetings\r\nbetween parliamentarians attending the general debate\r\nand senior United Nations officials have the dual\r\npurpose of heightening the awareness of\r\nparliamentarians on the questions under debate in the\r\nUnited Nations and establishing open and constructive\r\ndialogue with the Organization.\r\nWe also deem noteworthy the discussions that\r\ntake place during IPU conferences on issues relating to\r\npeace and security, as well as to economic and social\r\ndevelopment. These debates have engendered a greater\r\ncommitment by parliamentarians to forge legislation in\r\nkeeping with the commitments undertaken by\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nGovernments in the international arena. In order to\r\nsupport these efforts, a collection of handbooks for\r\nparliamentarians is being published jointly by the IPU\r\nand several United Nations agencies. We hope that the\r\nUnited Nations Secretariat will ensure more efficient\r\ncooperation in the preparation and publishing of these\r\nvery useful tools for legislative action. At this point, I\r\nwould be remiss if I did not pay tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,\r\nMr. Anders B. Johnsson, for his tireless efforts to\r\nrelaunch cooperation between the IPU and the United\r\nNations. As a sponsor of draft resolution A/57/L.38,\r\nthe Argentine Republic hopes that the General\r\nAssembly will adopt it by consensus.\r\nArgentina wishes, above all, to reaffirm its firm\r\ncommitment to disarmament and international security,\r\nwhich form an essential basis for building a peaceful\r\nand constructive relationship among nations and for\r\npromoting their development.\r\nIn this context, the role of the Chemical Weapons\r\nConvention, which it is the duty of the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to\r\nimplement, is of particular importance. However, it is a\r\ndifficult task involving the destruction of immense\r\narsenals, which will require substantial financial\r\ncontributions. Moreover, the political will of the\r\ninternational community is required to achieve the vital\r\nobjective of making the Convention universal.\r\nThe OPCW also has to ensure the fulfilment of\r\nanother of the Convention’s goals, namely, non-\r\nproliferation. In many instances, the task is to prevent\r\nwidely available chemical substances that might be\r\nneeded for the agricultural and industrial development\r\nof our countries from being manufactured and used for\r\nnon-peaceful purposes. This task is especially\r\nimportant at a time when the international community\r\nis threatened by the phenomenon of terrorism, which\r\nhas demonstrated its willingness to use any weapon of\r\nmass destruction to spread hatred and destruction.\r\nLikewise, the Convention’s preamble makes clear\r\nthat advances in the field of chemistry should be used\r\nexclusively for the benefit of humankind. We therefore\r\nemphasize the importance of the organization’s task\r\nand underline once more the importance of\r\ninternational cooperation in order to make available for\r\ndeveloping countries the human and technological\r\nresources for activities in the field of chemistry whose\r\npurposes are not prohibited by the Convention.\r\nOne of the numerous important tasks imposed by\r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention is the need for the\r\nimplementation of the Convention at the national level\r\nthrough the adoption of domestic legislation\r\nfacilitating the monitoring and prosecution of\r\nviolations of the Convention.\r\nDuring the current year, the organization has\r\nsuffered a crisis affecting its activities and threatening\r\nits future. Fortunately, with the cooperation of all\r\nStates Parties to the Convention, we have managed to\r\novercome that difficult situation and to restore the\r\nclimate of harmony and cooperation that must reign\r\namong all members of the organization, as well as\r\nbetween members and the Technical Secretariat, in\r\norder to achieve the goals of the organization.\r\nWe are pleased that the States Parties to the\r\nConvention have entrusted a distinguished Argentine\r\ndiplomat, Ambassador Rogelio Pfirter, with leading the\r\nTechnical Secretariat in the new stage that we are\r\nbeginning. We are confident that the new Director-\r\nGeneral, who has demonstrated his personal and\r\nprofessional talents throughout his long career in the\r\narea of peace and security, will bring a renewed\r\ndynamism to the organization and will work to ensure\r\nthat the Technical Secretariat carries out its activities in\r\nongoing consultation and understanding with all\r\nmember States. We wish the Director-General and all\r\nthe personnel of the Technical Secretariat every success\r\nin their important task.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing our hope that\r\nprogress will continue in all areas of the Convention on\r\nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production,\r\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their\r\nDestruction until the time when we can be certain that\r\nthe threat to the maintenance of international peace and\r\nsecurity caused by those terrible weapons of mass\r\ndestruction has forever been overcome.\r\nMr. Sun Joun-yung (Republic of Korea): My\r\ndelegation is pleased to take the floor on agenda item\r\n22 in the light of the increased necessity of intensifying\r\ncooperation and interaction between the United Nations\r\nand regional and other organizations in order to address\r\nthe challenges facing the international community\r\ntoday.\r\nWe will limit our comments to a few areas of\r\ncooperation that are of interest to us. The Republic of\r\nKorea accords special attention to cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\n(IPU). We believe that enhancing such a close,\r\ncooperative relationship will have a salutary impact on\r\nthe future of the Organization. That is because the\r\nmembers of the IPU bring with them vast experience\r\nand expertise in promoting the globalization of\r\ndemocracy, human rights and economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe are therefore pleased to note, as outlined in\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report (A/57/375), that this has\r\nbeen a productive year for cooperation between the\r\nIPU and the United Nations. Areas of fruitful\r\ncooperation have included the IPU’s participation in\r\nthe special session of the General Assembly on\r\nChildren, the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the follow-up to the World Food\r\nSummit.\r\nWhile acknowledging the endeavours of the IPU\r\nin carrying out the work of the United Nations at the\r\nnational level, through its legislative activities, there\r\nare still ample opportunities for the IPU and the United\r\nNations to cultivate substantive relations by going\r\nbeyond mere declarations. Hence, my delegation is\r\npleased once again to be a sponsor the draft resolution\r\non this item.\r\nAs a full dialogue partner of the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Republic of\r\nKorea welcomes the inclusion of the sub-item on the\r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda entitled “Cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations”, In our view, enhanced\r\ncooperation between the two bodies will contribute to\r\npromoting peace and stability and socio-economic\r\ndevelopment in the region. We hope that the\r\nformalization of the relationship between the two\r\nbodies, which already has a long history of\r\ndevelopment partnership, will be expanded in the years\r\nto come.\r\nWith respect to cooperation between the United\r\nNations and Asian-African Legal Consultative\r\nOrganization (AALCO), the two bodies have enjoyed a\r\nlong, constructive relationship in promoting and\r\ndeveloping international law. We take note with\r\nsatisfaction of the contributions of AALCO, especially\r\nin serving as a major forum of cooperation on legal\r\nissues and as an essential organization for Asian and\r\nAfrican countries in the development of international\r\nlaw. The Republic of Korea is thus honoured to host\r\nthe forty-second session of AALCO in June 2003 and\r\nremains confident that this meeting will become a\r\ncornerstone in ensuring the vital role of this body in the\r\ncoming years.\r\nLet me now address the issue of cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). My\r\ndelegation has always attached particular importance to\r\nthe activities of the OPCW, and that body has become\r\neven more relevant considering the current climate of\r\nthreats to international security, including potential acts\r\nof chemical terrorism.\r\nSince the adoption of the agreement on relations\r\nbetween the United Nations and the OPCW in May\r\n2001, progress has been accomplished in the area of\r\nmutually beneficial cooperation between the two\r\nbodies.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the OPCW has\r\nexpressed its readiness to cooperate with the Security\r\nCouncil’s Counter-Terrorism Committee by providing\r\ninformation and assistance in line with Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). As the threats of\r\nweapons of mass destruction grow, the OPCW deserves\r\nthe unreserved support of its member States and the\r\ninternational community at large, to strengthen its\r\nverification regime.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to say a\r\nfew words on the cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE).\r\nDuring the past year, the shared interests and\r\nconcerns of the United Nations and the OSCE have led\r\nto expanded cooperation in a number of important\r\nareas, including counter-terrorism, peacekeeping and\r\npeace-building initiatives, early warning and\r\npreventive diplomacy, refugees and promoting the\r\nrights of children. Having already acquired a solid\r\nrecord in those and other areas, the OSCE is uniquely\r\nplaced to collaborate in close partnership with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs a partner for cooperation with the OSCE, the\r\nRepublic of Korea is supportive of its activities and\r\nwelcomes the specific efforts directed to improve\r\nconsultation and cooperation between the respective\r\nheadquarters of the two organizations.\r\nMr. Iwiński (Poland): I would like to express my\r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for presenting his\r\ncomprehensive report on cooperation between the\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe. The report\r\nhighlights the progress made during the past year in the\r\narea of cooperation between two meaningful\r\ninternational organizations. This cooperation, although\r\nsometimes underestimated, constitutes an invaluable\r\ncontribution to the promotion of peace, democracy and\r\nhuman rights on the European continent.\r\nThe Council of Europe is the oldest European\r\nintegration organization. It emerged 53 years ago from\r\nthe pre-war ideas and concepts of a unified Europe. It\r\nwas also the first organization made up of democratic\r\nStates which included during the 1990s almost all\r\nCentral and Eastern European countries — among them\r\nPoland — giving them a sense of return to their own\r\nprinciples and values, as well as providing them with\r\nthe means to implement and consolidate their political,\r\nlegal and administrative reforms. After almost half a\r\ncentury, the Former Council of Western Europe has\r\ntaken steps over the past decade towards changing its\r\nshape, its name and its mission. Thus, the Council of\r\nEurope plays a key role in ensuring respect for, and\r\ncompliance with, human rights, on behalf of hundreds\r\nof millions of European citizens.\r\nIn an increasingly globalized world, cooperation\r\nbetween various international organizations,\r\ncomplementing cooperation among independent States,\r\nis urgent. In order to promote and implement the\r\nprinciples and values shared by their members, as well\r\nas to tackle the most important global issues —\r\ndiscussed recently at United Nations conferences held\r\nat such venues as Monterrey and Johannesburg — like-\r\nminded international institutions need to cooperate\r\nfurther within, and sometimes even beyond, their\r\nrespective mandates. The dialogue and cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations system and the Council of\r\nEurope can serve as an example of such an endeavour.\r\nThe Council of Europe shares with the United\r\nNations long and outstanding experience in promoting\r\npeace, democracy, the rule of law and human rights,\r\ncontributing to conflict prevention, confidence-\r\nbuilding and long-term post-conflict peace-building in\r\nmany countries. Both organizations are particularly\r\ninvolved in the Balkans, where United Nations\r\nMissions in Kosovo and in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\ntogether with the Council of Europe, collaborate to\r\nlend invaluable support in preparing legislation,\r\nproviding judicial and legal training and developing the\r\ninstitutions of civil society and local governments.\r\nThe engagement of the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe has already contributed to the\r\nconsolidation of stable local institutions, the\r\nintroduction of democratic legislation and a\r\nreinforcement of the private sector, in order to prevent\r\nanother terrible war from engulfing that part of Europe.\r\nFurther development of close cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe is required\r\nin peace-building and the establishment of political\r\nstability in South-Eastern Europe. Such cooperation\r\nshould include the training of human rights observers,\r\nhuman rights educational programmes and the\r\npromotion of dialogue among civilizations. Of course\r\ndialogue among civilizations refers to other continents,\r\nas well as Europe.\r\nThe wide range of activities of the Council of\r\nEurope gives it an opportunity to work in the field with\r\nvarious United Nations specialized organizations and\r\nprogrammes, such as the Offices of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioners for Human Rights and for\r\nRefugees, the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific\r\nand Cultural Organization, the United Nations\r\nEnvironmental Program and the International Labour\r\nOrganization, to name a few. While working together\r\nthey can learn from one another and undertake new\r\nchallenges, which concern almost all aspects of\r\npolitical and social life, including such important\r\nissues as the prevention of terrorism, transnational\r\norganized crime, corruption, money-laundering,\r\ntrafficking in human beings, the return of refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons to their countries of origin\r\nand racial discrimination.\r\nThe tragic events of 11 September taught us that\r\nin order to prevent threats to peace, security and\r\nprosperity, all global issues have to be resolved in a\r\ncomprehensive and sustainable manner by joint action.\r\nThe United Nations and the Council of Europe can play\r\na role in these endeavours. As Chair of the Committee\r\non Migration, Refugees and Demography of the\r\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I\r\nmust stress the need for joint action in this context to\r\nresolve the worsening problem of refugees and illegal\r\nmigrants.\r\nPoland highly appreciates the role of the Council\r\nof Europe in promoting and implementing values and\r\nprinciples such as democracy and the rule of law. We\r\nare also in favour of further enhancing the close\r\ncooperation and coordination of work between the\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nCouncil for Europe and the United Nations family,\r\nencouraging further exchanges of views, experiences\r\nand expertise on many other subjects of common\r\ninterest. Despite concentrating our current efforts on\r\nthe final phase of accession negotiations with the\r\nEuropean Union, we attach special importance to the\r\nactivities of the Council of Europe, especially those\r\nwhich contribute to promoting peace, stability and\r\ndemocracy across the continent. We are of the opinion\r\nthat the Council of Europe has contributed over all the\r\ndecades of its existence to the practical implementation\r\nof the values embodied in the Charter of the United\r\nNations in many parts of Europe. The Council of\r\nEurope is perhaps the only international institution\r\nwhich conceived and implemented a system of human\r\nrights protection, including the European Court of\r\nHuman Rights, which is available to every person\r\noriginating from a State party to the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights and Fundamental\r\nFreedoms. This is just one example of how the values\r\nshared by the United Nations and the Council of\r\nEurope can be mutually defended and promoted.\r\nLet me say in conclusion that I am convinced that\r\nthe forthcoming meetings of the Council of Europe will\r\nprovide an opportunity to further discuss the issue of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe. We should particularly focus on the\r\nnew challenges of the 21st century. To face them in an\r\neffective way, we undoubtedly need new thoughts,\r\nprojects and activities, together with new mechanisms\r\nfor cooperation.\r\nI would like to confirm my country’s readiness,\r\nexpressed a few months ago during the last visit by the\r\nSecretary General of the Council of Europe to Warsaw,\r\nto organize the third Council of Europe Summit in\r\nPoland. The final modalities of this event would be\r\ndiscussed in May 2003 during the next session of the\r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council.\r\nFinally, I would like to give my full support to the\r\nsuggestion by the United Nations Secretary-General\r\nthat he report more comprehensively on the\r\ncooperation between the two organizations on an\r\nevery-other-year basis.\r\nMr. Malofeev (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The\r\ntwenty-first century, the state of world affairs and the\r\nneeds of United Nations Member States have\r\nchallenged the Organization with more complex and\r\nmassive tasks. The most important components of\r\ninternational development, including overcoming\r\neconomic backwardness, poverty eradication,\r\nelimination of crime, measures to maintain peace and\r\nsecurity, the protection of the environment and\r\ncombating terrorism are constantly at the centre of\r\nattention at the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations is increasing its influence in\r\nthese and other areas through strengthening the\r\nOrganization’s potential by means of comprehensive\r\nreform. The Republic of Belarus is interested in\r\nenhancing and increasing the authority and influence of\r\nthe United Nations, not only because our country is one\r\nof the founding Member States of the United Nations.\r\nIn the United Nations, we see support for all countries,\r\nregardless of their size, economic and political power\r\nand geographical area. Within the United Nations, all\r\ncountries can hold an equal dialogue and are not\r\ndependent on the passing moods of the major world\r\nPowers.\r\nThe United Nations is involved in the solution of\r\nthe most current and acute international problems, as\r\nare international parliamentarians. National\r\nparliaments are in a good position to do a great deal of\r\nwise and productive work, to improve the lives of\r\npeople throughout the world. It is no accident that the\r\nagenda of the current session of the General Assembly\r\nincludes the subject of cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional and other organizations. The\r\nUnited Nations is, therefore, one of the most important\r\nplaces for this discussion concerning the\r\ninterrelationship between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).\r\nIn expressing the position of the Belarus\r\nParliament, I would like to say that the IPU is an\r\nauthoritative and influential body bringing together 144\r\nparliaments of the world. The leadership of the IPU is\r\ninterested in developing fruitful relations with the\r\nUnited Nations and is doing everything possible to\r\nstrengthen these contacts. Mr. Anders Johnsson, the\r\nSecretary General of the IPU, is making every effort to\r\ndevelop such cooperation.\r\nOver the past few years, the IPU has adopted and\r\nimplemented several resolutions, as well as other\r\nmeasures, to support the United Nations, a topic that\r\narises frequently at major United Nations conferences\r\nand meetings of the Security Council. The Belarus\r\ndelegation greatly appreciates the activities of the\r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nAnnan, who greatly supports developing relations with\r\nthe IPU.\r\nThe Millennium General Assembly, held at the\r\nUnited Nations in September 2000 with the\r\nparticipation of heads of State or Government, was an\r\nimportant milestone. The IPU conference of presidents\r\nof national parliaments was also important. The\r\nDeclaration adopted at the Millennium Assembly\r\nstressed the need to establish closer relations between\r\nthe United Nations and the IPU, and I well recall that\r\ntime, since I was a participant in those forums and\r\nspoke from this very rostrum.\r\nSince the Millennium Summit, a great deal has\r\nbeen accomplished. Today we can justifiably say that\r\ncooperation between two powerful organizations is\r\nprogressing. This is clearly seen in the report of the\r\nSecretary-General submitted to the 57th session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, which provides a full picture of the\r\ninteraction of the two organizations. Of great\r\nsignificance to the IPU are the annual meetings of\r\nparliamentarians at United Nations Headquarters in\r\nNew York, as well as their participation in the meetings\r\nof the United Nations General Assembly as members\r\nof national delegations.\r\nThe day before yesterday we held our regular\r\nannual meeting. Such meetings give parliamentarians\r\ngreater opportunities to communicate problems of\r\ncommon interest. IPU is pleased that it has been\r\nproposed for observer status in the meetings and work\r\nof the General Assembly. We also support the proposed\r\nresolution for the General Assembly on cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU.\r\nToday we cannot but touch upon the topic of\r\nterrorism. The brutality and the scale of the inhuman\r\ntragedy on 11 September 2001 shook the whole planet.\r\nThe world has never before witnessed such a\r\nmonstrous event. The taking, of nearly 1,000 hostages\r\nfrom two dozen countries in Moscow last month by\r\nChechnyan fighters, again confirmed that international\r\nterrorism not only possesses a powerful financial basis,\r\nbut is also very well equipped technically, well\r\norganized and also, unfortunately, finds support and\r\nfinancing for its inhuman actions in several States.\r\nThese two events are, unfortunately, links in the\r\nsame chain. They have changed the world and have\r\nshown that no country is immune to possible attacks\r\nand terrorist acts. Today the world is one in its\r\nunderstanding of the need to combat the evil of\r\ninternational terrorism. In these circumstances, the role\r\nof the United Nations and the IPU significantly\r\nincreases in combining the efforts of States to combat\r\nterrorism and we feel it is the United Nations which\r\nshould be the centre for developing strategies and\r\ntactics for action by the international community to\r\ncounter this evil.\r\nIn turn, the IPU can and must assume the function\r\nof coordinator of the activities of national parliaments\r\nto quickly bring all countries of the world to adhere to\r\nUnited Nations anti-terrorism conventions. We need to\r\naccelerate the finalization and adoption of a\r\ncomprehensive convention on combating terrorism. My\r\ncountry considers itself an inseparable part of the\r\ninternational anti-terrorism coalition and, within\r\ninternational law, is making its contribution to this\r\ncommon cause.\r\nThis year we adopted a national law on\r\ncombating terrorism and have included several other\r\nmeasures. However, we must all understand that the\r\nbreeding ground for terrorism is backwardness,\r\nunderdevelopment and a lack of basic living conditions\r\nfor normal life for many people. These problems create\r\nsocial and political instability in many regions of the\r\nworld.\r\nI shall touch upon one other global problem\r\nwhich is of great concern. We need to recognize that\r\nthe world environmental situation is seriously\r\ndeteriorating. The main cause of this is a not always\r\njudicious, sometimes even dangerous production\r\nactivities of man which can cause serious manmade\r\ndisasters. Just such a disaster — the Chernobyl nuclear\r\npower station accident — had a profound impact upon\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI would like to once again recall the tragic\r\nconsequences of this accident. More than 70 per cent of\r\nthe radioactive fallout fell on our territory. One in five\r\ninhabitants of Belarus, including more than half a\r\nmillion children, have been affected. Annually the\r\nState spends 15 per cent of its budget on eliminating\r\nthe consequences of the accident. The Republic of\r\nBelarus is sincerely grateful to the many States of the\r\nworld for their assistance which has been given in\r\novercoming the consequences of the Chernobyl\r\ndisaster. International assistance, however, is not\r\ncommensurate with the scale of the disaster at\r\nChernobyl and the resultant losses being borne by\r\nBelarus. We welcome, therefore, the new strategy of\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nthe Organization endorsed by the General Assembly on\r\nthe socio-economic rehabilitation of the regions\r\naffected as a result of the Chernobyl accident.\r\nI hope that through joint efforts at the State and\r\nparliamentary levels we will be able to find an\r\neffective solution to the pressing problems facing all of\r\nhumankind.\r\nMr. Bergqvist (Sweden): Speaking on behalf of\r\nthe Government of Sweden, let me first of all stress\r\nthat I associate myself entirely with the message\r\ndelivered by the presidency of the European Union.\r\nAs a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of\r\nthe Council of Europe, I will naturally focus on the\r\nrelations between the Council of Europe and the United\r\nNations.\r\nThe highest common denominator between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe is the central\r\nrole that human rights play in their activities. The\r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the\r\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights are both\r\nutterly central instruments for achieving humanism in\r\nthe world.\r\nThe United Nations and the Council of Europe\r\nhave always complemented each other. Following the\r\nend of the cold war, this complementarity has grown\r\neven more important. Today, one of the main\r\nundertakings of the Council of Europe is active support\r\nfor the rule of law and the development of sound\r\npractices in new and re-established democracies. This\r\nalso has global implications and is of great importance\r\nfrom a United Nations perspective.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\r\noften talked about the need to take intergovernmental\r\npolicy decisions back to the citizens, who are the ones\r\nwho will abide by these decisions and benefit from\r\nthem. The Secretary-General has underlined the need\r\nfor a two-way political discussion to make citizens\r\nunderstand and accept decisions which, to them, might\r\nseem to have been made far away and as a result of\r\ncomplicated international processes.\r\nHere, the Council of Europe and other regional\r\norganizations can be of great use.\r\nWhen the Council of Europe was created in 1949,\r\nit was a unique international organization insofar as it\r\nincluded a body with direct democratic links to the\r\npeople: the Parliamentary Assembly. That institution\r\nwas made up of elected members of national\r\nparliaments, that is, politicians who had a mandate\r\nfrom their voters and were responsible to them. True,\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union had had a similar set-up\r\nin the nineteenth century, but the Council of Europe\r\ncombined this with the Committee of Ministers, which\r\nnot only represents the member Governments, but is\r\nobliged to react, in the name of those Governments, to\r\npolitical impulses from the Parliamentary Assembly.\r\nFor many years, the Parliamentary Assembly of\r\nthe Council of Europe has also served as a democratic\r\nanchor for the Organization for Economic Cooperation\r\nand Development (OECD). Once a year, parliamentary\r\ndelegations from Korea, Japan, Canada and Mexico\r\njoin the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the\r\nCouncil of Europe to discuss the development of the\r\nworld economy and other OECD matters.\r\nIn the 1990s, the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) formed its own\r\nParliamentary Assembly. The OSCE complements the\r\nCouncil of Europe in an interesting way: both\r\norganizations deal with, inter alia, human rights and\r\nsocial, cultural and economic issues. The difference is\r\nthat the OSCE does it from a broad perspective of\r\nsecurity and the Council of Europe from a perspective\r\nof individual rights.\r\nConsequently, within the framework of the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, there are lots of opportunities to\r\nutilize the direct links between the members of the\r\nParliamentary Assembly and their constituents for a\r\ndirect political discussion on urgent international\r\nissues. Furthermore, with the creation of the Congress\r\nof Local and Regional Authorities within the Council\r\nof Europe, an even more basic channel to the\r\npopulations of Europe has been established.\r\nThis opens up interesting perspectives for\r\npolitical dialogue, especially since the core activities\r\nare so much in parallel. I am thinking of the meticulous\r\neveryday work that is done, which is not always\r\nspectacular, but has immense long-term importance in\r\nterms of conflict prevention. For instance, there is\r\ninter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue, and history\r\nschoolbooks are scrutinized to identify and change\r\ntraditional but negative or xenophobic descriptions of\r\nthe neighbouring world.\r\nLet us make optimal use of our common\r\nresources to develop conflict-prevention strategies and\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nbuild up a more systematic conflict-prevention\r\nmachinery. At the recent European Union regional\r\nmeeting on conflict prevention, held in Sweden in\r\nAugust, both the Council of Europe and the United\r\nNations were able to share valuable experiences of\r\npractical cooperation in this field.\r\nThere is an interesting offspring of the Council of\r\nEurope called the European Centre for Global\r\nInterdependence and Solidarity, or simply the North-\r\nSouth Centre. As can be deduced from its name, the\r\nCentre’s goal is to serve as a bridge to other cultures.\r\nIn addition, it is currently working hard to follow up\r\nthe Johannesburg meeting in the field of education for\r\nsustainable development, where it has made great\r\nefforts in supporting the work of the United Nations\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe.\r\nThe Council of Europe is proud of the fact that it\r\nhas managed to create an area free of capital\r\npunishment under all circumstances. This is manifested\r\nin the 13th Additional Protocol to the European\r\nConvention on Human Rights, which a majority of\r\nmember States have now also signed.\r\nFollowing the tragic events of 11 September last\r\nyear, it was only natural for the Council of Europe to\r\nmake every possible contribution to the fight against\r\nterrorism. That political preparedness resulted, among\r\nother things, in a set of guidelines for the important\r\nwork of combating terrorism while preserving\r\ndemocracy and human rights.\r\nIt is of crucial importance that States do not\r\ndeviate from their democratic standards of openness,\r\nresponsibility and legal predictability just because they\r\nare dealing with evil terrorists. If we are not steadfast\r\nin that respect we may soon find ourselves on a very\r\nslippery slope towards lower standards in the field of\r\ndemocracy and human rights. In that context, it is also\r\nto be hoped that the International Criminal Court will\r\neventually be universally recognized and that its\r\nStatute will not be diluted or set aside by bilateral\r\nagreements.\r\nWe must all do our best to ensure that the high\r\nstandards of the United Nations — which are also the\r\nstandards of the Council of Europe — will prevail in\r\nthe future. Together and in increasingly close\r\npartnership, we must build further on that platform.\r\nMr. Musambachime (Zambia): My delegation\r\nwould like to express its appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report contained in documents A/57/94\r\nand A/57/94/Add.1, in which he provides an update to\r\nhis previous reports contained in documents A/56/134\r\nand A/56/134/Add.1, on programmes and activities\r\nundertaken by Member States and bodies of the United\r\nNations in cooperation with the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC).\r\nMy delegation also wishes to associate itself with\r\nthe statements made by the representative of Angola on\r\nbehalf of SADC and by the representative of the\r\nRepublic of South Africa on behalf of the African\r\nUnion, in which they urged support for the draft\r\nresolutions they introduced, draft resolutions\r\nA/57/L.30 — on cooperation with SADC — and\r\nA/57/39 — on cooperation with the African Union —\r\nrespectively.\r\nMy Government recognizes the importance of\r\nregional integration as a fundamental tool to foster\r\nsocial and economic development. Given the small size\r\nof our individual economies, which are unable to\r\nachieve economies of scale in the production and\r\nmarketing of products, there is a need to work together\r\nas a region in order to achieve significant levels of\r\neconomic growth and to compete in a world that is\r\nbecoming increasingly dominated by large trading\r\nblocs. Trade liberalization and regional integration will\r\ntherefore promote greater growth through improved\r\nresource allocation, greater competition, technology\r\ntransfers and improved access to foreign capital.\r\nIt is in that regard that my delegation firmly\r\nsupports the New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD), which provides a comprehensive and\r\nintegrated development plan that addresses key social,\r\neconomic and political issues on the continent. The\r\ninternational community should support the\r\ncommitment of our leaders in Africa to the people by\r\nassisting Africa to embark on a path of sustainable\r\ngrowth. That can be achieved through the continent’s\r\naccelerated integration into the global economy.\r\nWe welcome the support the NEPAD initiative\r\nhas received at major conferences, in particular at the\r\nGroup of Eight Summit held in Kananaskis, Canada.\r\nWe also applaud the high-level plenary meeting of the\r\nGeneral Assembly that was held on 16 September 2002\r\nand devoted to a discussion of the NEPAD issue. We\r\nwelcome resolution 57/2, which was adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at that meeting, and hope that it will\r\nbe fully implemented. That support is a clear\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nmanifestation of the commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to address the problems of the region, and\r\nthose of the continent as a whole.\r\nWith regard to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, we note with appreciation the role of the\r\nUnited Nations and the international community in\r\nsupport of efforts by SADC to promote sustainable\r\ndevelopment and regional integration in a broad\r\nspectrum of economic and social areas. We also note\r\nwith great satisfaction the efforts of the United Nations\r\nand Member States to initiate and strengthen\r\ncooperation with SADC and its member States in the\r\nareas of conflict prevention, conflict resolution,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building. Those efforts have\r\nheightened the prospects for peace in Angola and the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nHowever, I wish to highlight two areas of grave\r\nconcern to our region, namely, the humanitarian crisis\r\naffecting the SADC region and the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic.\r\nFor the third consecutive year, Southern Africa\r\nhas been affected by natural disasters. This year,\r\ndrought has affected Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland,\r\nZambia and Zimbabwe, causing severe food shortages.\r\nAccording to available information, 14.5 million\r\npeople are affected. That combination of calamities\r\ncomes at a time when the extent of the humanitarian\r\ncrisis in the region is becoming clear. It is estimated\r\nthat there will be a total regional shortfall of 4 million\r\ntons of food over the next year, of which 1.2 million\r\ntons will be met by emergency food aid.\r\nWith respect to my country, Zambia, this is the\r\nsecond year that we are experiencing severe drought. It\r\nis estimated that 2.3 million people need emergency\r\nfood assistance. That unfortunate situation has further\r\nbeen exacerbated by the high prevalence of AIDS,\r\nwhich affects the most productive age group — that in\r\nthe range of 15 to 49 years of age.\r\nFurthermore, poor communities have become\r\nmore vulnerable to natural disasters and erratic\r\nweather. In addition, other factors faced by the\r\nregion — such as economic decline, dwindling\r\ncommodity prices and limited access to Western\r\nmarkets — are constraining development.\r\nAgainst that background, my delegation wishes to\r\nappeal to the international community for food aid to\r\nsolve the immediate food shortages and to prevent a\r\nsevere catastrophe. We further appeal to the donor\r\ncommunity to take an integrated approach to the\r\nproblem, as this is not just a question of famine but\r\nalso one that involves a wider public health issue as\r\nregards water and sanitation. In the long run it would\r\nalso be advisable for the donor community to engage\r\nand strengthen regional mechanisms within SADC to\r\naddress this crisis.\r\nFinally, we wish to express our support for the\r\nviews of other delegations that have called on the\r\nSecretary-General to continue to intensify contacts\r\naimed at promoting and harmonizing cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community. The challenges facing our\r\nCommunity are grave, but they are not insurmountable.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations is best placed to\r\nmobilize the necessary resources from the international\r\ncommunity that will effectively address the problems\r\nwe are confronting in the region. My delegation\r\nappeals for support for the draft resolutions before us.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I would\r\nlike to align myself with previous speakers in\r\nexpressing my delegation’s appreciation to the\r\nSecretary-General for the preparation of the reports on\r\nthe agenda item entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations”.\r\nGiven the time factor, I would like to focus on sub-\r\nitems 22 (b), (d), (l), (n) and (o).\r\nThe Republic of Azerbaijan attaches great\r\nimportance to cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand regional and other organizations. These\r\norganizations are an integral part of a globalizing world\r\nthat needs consolidated and coordinated efforts at the\r\nregional level aimed at combating such threats and\r\nchallenges as military conflicts, terrorism, drug\r\ntrafficking, organized crime, arms smuggling, illegal\r\nmigration, proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, natural disasters, poverty and social and\r\neconomic degradation.\r\nDuring the last decade the significance of the\r\nCouncil of Europe has grown. This organization plays\r\nan outstanding role in instituting European integration\r\nand leading the process towards the formation of a\r\ncommon legal framework through the unification of\r\nnational legislation on the basis of European\r\nconventional norms, strengthening democratic\r\ninstitutions and developing cultural identity in Europe.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nThe enlargement of the Council of Europe created\r\nan opportunity for the new Eastern European\r\ndemocracies to participate closely in European life and\r\nto quickly develop the conditions needed to meet the\r\nsocio-political and juridical requirements for admission\r\nto the European Union. We underline the valuable\r\ncontribution of the Council to democratic stability in\r\nEurope and welcome the fact that the activities of that\r\norganization are increasingly being referred to by\r\nothers beyond the region of its responsibility. The\r\nCouncil’s experience deserves close attention by the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn today’s world the importance of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) as a\r\nstructure that brings together States on the basis of\r\ncommon cultural, historical and religious traditions and\r\nvalues is growing. In the context of new challenges,\r\nthat organization plays a significant role as an\r\ninfluential participant in the dialogue aimed at\r\nstrengthening confidence between civilizations. Having\r\ngained since its very inception a solid international\r\nreputation and influence, particularly in the vast area\r\nfrom North Africa to South-Eastern Asia, where\r\nnumerous “hot spots” exist, the OIC has demonstrated\r\nits true interest in ensuring international peace and\r\nsecurity and has consolidated the efforts of Islamic\r\nStates to combat current challenges and risks.\r\nWith a profound perception from within of the\r\nproblems of the Orient and their complex character, the\r\nOIC would expect that the international community\r\nwould be more attentive to its opinion with regard to\r\nthe achievement of stability and accord in regions with\r\npredominant Muslim populations. Constructive\r\ndialogue and cooperation with the OIC could\r\ncontribute to the solution of many complex issues,\r\nincluding the settlement of armed conflicts and\r\nsuppression of sources of international terrorism.\r\nIt is noteworthy that a large number of OIC\r\ncountries have vast natural resources and great\r\npotential for development. Effective utilization of these\r\nresources would benefit those countries and would\r\nsecure interests throughout the world, as a result of a\r\ncomprehensively balanced relationship with the Orient.\r\nThe Black Sea Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (BSEC) has developed from a\r\ncooperation initiative in the Black Sea region into a\r\nEuropean organization, with a broad range of sub-\r\nentities. This process has gained pace during the last\r\nthree years.\r\nCooperation among States with different values,\r\nlevels of economic development, natural resources and\r\nproductive forces sets the ground for a deepening of\r\nmutual dialogue and for exploration of common ways\r\nto develop economic cooperation in the region. Priority\r\ndirections of the organization have already been\r\ndetermined and include mainly the energy and\r\ntransport sectors. Azerbaijan contributes actively to the\r\nBSEC, and in a wider context, to Europe in the\r\ndevelopment of these important sectors.\r\nBeing actively engaged in the expansion of its\r\nrelations with the outside world, Azerbaijan places\r\ngreat significance on the further development of mutual\r\nadvantageous cooperation with members of the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS). In 2001,\r\nAzerbaijan was granted the status of a permanent\r\nobserver at that organization. Our country will do its\r\nutmost to contribute positively to cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the OAS.\r\nContinuing our discussion of the significance of\r\nregional organizations in global development, we see\r\nthe OSCE as the only European structure that brings\r\ntogether all countries of the region. The historical merit\r\nof that organization, which took upon itself the\r\nresponsibility for building a pan-European home on the\r\nbasis of common principles of security and\r\ncooperation, is in its important role in sustaining peace\r\nin the era of the bloc confrontation, in the democratic\r\ntransformation of Eastern European societies at the end\r\nof last century, as well as in establishing prerequisites\r\nfor the integration process throughout the European\r\ncontinent. Owing to the activities of OSCE, there has\r\nbeen rapprochement among European States, and\r\nstandards of conduct and the main spheres of\r\ncooperation were established.\r\nMeanwhile, during the last decade, the\r\neffectiveness of the OSCE to countering dangerous\r\nnew challenges was seriously tested. We believe that\r\nthe OSCE has to enhance its contribution to the\r\nsettlement of conflicts primarily in the area of its\r\nresponsibility.\r\nIn this context, allow me to touch upon the\r\npeaceful settlement of Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict\r\nwithin the framework of the OSCE Minsk Group.\r\nMediation by the Minsk Group should be impartial,\r\njust and aimed at the unconditional implementation of\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\ndecisions of the OSCE and the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil with regard to the withdrawal of Armenian\r\noccupying forces from the occupied territories of\r\nAzerbaijan and the complete elimination of the\r\nconsequences of the armed conflict, with a settlement\r\nbased on strict compliance with the principles set forth\r\nin the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.\r\nDeparture from these principles and decisions or\r\nconsideration of proposals by mediators based on the\r\nacceptance of fait accompli put the rule of law and the\r\neffectiveness of international mediation under serious\r\ndoubt, undermine confidence in the OSCE Minsk\r\nGroup and negatively impact the prestige of the OSCE,\r\nwhich plays a lead role in the resolution of the conflict\r\nin and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region of\r\nAzerbaijan, as rightly mentioned in the Secretary\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “Cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE”, document A/57/217.\r\nWe maintain, however, that given the protracted lack of\r\nprogress in the negotiations and the “conciliation”\r\nefforts by the mediators with regard to the results of\r\nthe Armenian aggression, there is a need for decisive\r\nintervention by the Security Council, which has not\r\nexhausted all its opportunities for exerting influence to\r\nachieve a breakthrough in the negotiations.\r\nFor our part, my country has very recently put\r\nforward a package of proposals on the partial\r\nelimination of the consequences of the Armenian-\r\nAzerbaijani conflict and the establishment of\r\ncooperation. Backed by the international organizations\r\nconcerned, the package implies the withdrawal of\r\nArmenian armed forces from four occupied districts of\r\nAzerbaijan and the restoration of the main railroad line\r\npassing through those territories and linking\r\nAzerbaijan, Armenia and other countries of the region.\r\nHowever, our proposals, the realization of which could\r\nhave been an important confidence-building step\r\ntowards a peaceful resolution of the conflict and\r\nregional cooperation, were rejected by Armenia.\r\nLet me conclude by emphasizing that enhanced\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations will lead to the increased\r\npractical and operational effectiveness and efficiency\r\nof the organizations involved. Our delegation is also\r\nconvinced that the United Nations can only benefit\r\nfrom close cooperation with those organizations.\r\nMr. Salman (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I should like to express our appreciation for the\r\nfact that cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and other organizations has become a separate\r\nitem on our agenda, which will undoubtedly give added\r\nimpetus to the working methods of the General\r\nAssembly and improve its efficiency. In addition, my\r\ndelegation commends the Secretary-General for his\r\nreport contained in document A/57/375, which details\r\nthe levels of cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and their\r\nactivities in the fields of peace, security, economic and\r\nsocial development, international law, human rights\r\nand democracy. We believe that the IPU has an\r\nimmense wealth of knowledge and experience from\r\nwhich the Organization can greatly benefit.\r\nThe Inter-Parliamentary Union represents the\r\nvoices of the people. Accordingly, it must be a\r\nsignificant component of the work of the United\r\nNations and should play an important role in the\r\nstrengthening of multilateral diplomacy. That will be\r\npossible only if our legislative bodies have a greater\r\npart in decision-making processes to enhance\r\ninternational cooperation within the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations. Parliaments are an expression of the\r\nvoices of the people, and thus, their participation\r\nguarantees the democratic nature of such decision-\r\nmaking processes.\r\nAn important aspect to note in that regard is the\r\nIPU’s ability to make a positive contribution to the\r\ncurrent debate on reform of the United Nations,\r\nespecially that of the Security Council and of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Council resolutions should be just\r\nand democratic and should allow those affected by\r\nsuch resolutions to take them before the International\r\nCourt of Justice so that the Court can decide whether or\r\nnot they conform to the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThat would prevent one or more countries from\r\npressuring the Security Council to adopt resolutions of\r\nill political intent without giving those affected the\r\nright to any legal recourse to ascertain the legality of\r\nsuch resolutions, just as citizens have the right to\r\nquestion the constitutionality of laws adopted by\r\nlegislative bodies and high tribunals.\r\nRelations and cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the IPU conform to the provisions of the\r\nCharter, which encourages and determines partnerships\r\namong regional organizations, especially with regard to\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. As\r\nmy delegation has noted, the IPU should actively\r\nparticipate in any important agenda items that have\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\ninternational implications. Such a partnership is\r\nessential under the current circumstances and\r\nchallenges now faced by the international community,\r\nbecause it can improve the transparency of the\r\nOrganization’s work and its accountability to\r\ninternational public opinion.\r\nIn order to halt the anarchy that is spreading\r\nthrough international relations as a result of the\r\nincreasing tendency to infringe upon the sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of States and to interfere in\r\ntheir internal affairs — contrary to the principles of the\r\nCharter — and to stop the United Nations from losing\r\nthe respect of the world’s peoples and from being\r\nconsumed by selfish interests, we call on the IPU to\r\njoin other organizations of goodwill in their efforts to\r\nsave the Organization and to confront the policies of\r\nhegemony, tyranny and destabilization of States and\r\nthe inflaming of ethnic divisions.\r\nWhat is happening in Iraq as a result of the\r\nembargo that the United States insists on maintaining\r\nwithout any moral or legal support is clearly a case of\r\ntyranny and injustice. Indeed, it constitutes genocide\r\nthat not even United Nations personnel could tolerate.\r\nGenocide is a crime under the Charter and international\r\nlaw, yet it is occurring there. Every day, the children,\r\nwomen and elderly people of Iraq are dying. What is\r\nhappening in the Security Council with regard to the\r\nIraqi question is yet another example of flagrant\r\nviolation of the Charter and of international law.\r\nThe people of Iraq, the Arab people, the Muslims\r\nand all the free peoples of the world call for\r\ndemocracy, respect for justice, the application of\r\ninternational legitimacy and respect for the Charter and\r\nfor international law in word and in deed. To that end,\r\nthe IPU can make a positive contribution. It is our hope\r\nthat the debate on this item will strengthen cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the IPU. Will our\r\nmeeting succeed in bringing that about? We sincerely\r\nhope that it will.\r\nMr. Davis (United Kingdom): Thank you, Mr.\r\nPresident, for giving me the floor to address this\r\nimportant agenda item. I should like to begin by\r\nthanking the distinguished representative of Denmark,\r\nwho spoke earlier in the debate on behalf of the\r\nmember States of the European Union, and to take this\r\nopportunity to put on record that the delegation of the\r\nUnited Kingdom fully endorses their statement.\r\nAs we did last year, we have gladly supported the\r\nSecretary-General’s recommendation that the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU) be granted observer status\r\nhere at the United Nations. And the British Group of\r\nthe IPU has also asked me to pass on its full support. I\r\nwelcome this recognition of the valuable role that the\r\nIPU plays worldwide in fostering peace and security\r\nthrough dialogue, in promoting democracy and respect\r\nfor human rights, and in contributing to the\r\ndevelopment of representative and effective legislative\r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe IPU already does a great deal of excellent\r\nwork in support of the objectives of the United\r\nNations. In recent months, it has also provided\r\nparliamentary forums on the occasions of the fifty-\r\neighth session of the United Nations Commission on\r\nHuman Rights, the General Assembly special session\r\non children, the World Food Summit: five years later\r\nand the World Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nAnd, of course, the Parliamentary Assembly of the\r\nCouncil of Europe is also much involved in the follow-\r\nup to the World Summit on Sustainable Development.\r\nThat is one reason why, as a member of the\r\nUnited Kingdom delegation to the Parliamentary\r\nAssembly and leader of the Socialist Group — the\r\nlargest political group in the Assembly — I also\r\nwelcome and support the draft resolution on\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, with its total membership of 44\r\ncountries, following the accession of Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina during the past year, and our close\r\nrelationship with Canada, Mexico and several other\r\nmembers of the United Nations from other continents.\r\nThe Council of Europe and the United Nations\r\nemerged at a similar point in history. Both shared a\r\ncommon goal: to put an end to the scourge of war. The\r\nstatesmen who struggled to make the Council of\r\nEurope a reality took heart from the foundation of the\r\nUnited Nations. More than 50 years have passed, and\r\ntoday the Council of Europe continues to regard the\r\nUnited Nations as a source of inspiration and practical\r\nexpertise in achieving our common goals. The two\r\norganizations are mutually reinforcing. The Council of\r\nEurope looks to the United Nations to take a lead on\r\nglobal conflict prevention and human rights issues. In\r\nreturn, it serves to underpin and advance the universal\r\ngoals and values of the United Nations throughout the\r\nEuropean continent.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nTragically, despite the efforts of the United\r\nNations, the Council of Europe and others, war and\r\nconflict remain a global scourge that destroys the lives\r\nand hopes of millions. Europe has not been immune.\r\nThe end of the cold war brought most of Central and\r\nEastern Europe into the Council of Europe, but this\r\ndevelopment was preceded by violent conflicts that\r\nsaw human rights abuses on a massive scale in the\r\nSouth Caucasus and South-East Europe. No one would\r\nclaim that the United Nations has got everything right\r\nin South-East Europe. But it has played a vital role in\r\nstabilizing the region and in bringing to justice those\r\nresponsible for serious war crimes and some of the\r\nworst abuses of human rights.\r\nThe Council of Europe has worked alongside the\r\nUnited Nations to assist its post-conflict peace-building\r\nefforts. At the request of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE), the Council of Europe once again mounted an\r\nelection observation mission in Kosovo for this year’s\r\nlocal government elections. In Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, the Council of Europe is supporting the\r\nwork of the Office of the High Representative by\r\nextensive training of the judiciary. And the Council of\r\nEurope is involved in the promotion of human rights\r\nand democratic institutions, economic development and\r\nthe fight against corruption across the whole of South-\r\nEast Europe, especially through our contribution to the\r\nStability Pact for South Eastern Europe.\r\nBut cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nthe Council of Europe goes far beyond the borders of\r\nSouth-East Europe. It is about the mutual\r\nreinforcement of a common set of values and goals. It\r\nis about respect for human rights; the prevention of\r\ntorture; the fight against discrimination, racism and\r\nxenophobia; and the campaign for equal treatment and\r\nequal opportunities for men and women. It is about\r\nsecuring a better future, based on universally held\r\nrights and values. The points of interaction are too\r\nnumerous to catalogue in full, so I shall mention just a\r\nfew.\r\nAs the report of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral shows, the last year has been notable for\r\nincreased cooperation between the Council of Europe,\r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human\r\nRights and the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nRefugees. Of course, the Council of Europe’s greatest\r\ncontribution to human rights and peace is its legal\r\ninstruments. And when we are engaged in the\r\npromotion of the European Convention on Human\r\nRights, we are, at the same time, promoting respect for\r\nthe rights set out in the Universal Declaration. Our\r\nFramework Convention for the Protection of National\r\nMinorities is a legally binding instrument based on\r\nprinciples established in a United Nations text.\r\nSimilarly, the Council of Europe has been a\r\ntireless advocate of the International Criminal Court.\r\nMore than 30 of our member States have ratified the\r\nRome Statute, which is now in force. The Council of\r\nEurope pledges to continue working with its member\r\nStates in helping the implementation of the Statute.\r\nWe also applaud the plan to adopt a draft optional\r\nprotocol to the United Nations Convention against\r\nTorture. The European Committee for the Prevention of\r\nTorture, which is one of the most important activities\r\nof the Council of Europe, looks forward to working\r\nwith the United Nations subcommittee that we set up as\r\na result of the adoption of the protocol. The Council of\r\nEurope, through another of its important activities, the\r\nEuropean Commission against Racism and Intolerance,\r\nhas also been active in the implementation of the\r\nconclusions of the World Conference against Racism,\r\nRacial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related\r\nIntolerance.\r\nWe have a joint mission with the United Nations\r\nand the rest of the international community. This\r\nmission is to defeat the forces of hatred and fanaticism,\r\nwhich are the antithesis of human rights, and which can\r\nlead, as we have seen, to indiscriminate terrorism. The\r\nUnited Nations has taken a leading role in the\r\ninternational response to the events of 11 September.\r\nThe Council of Europe’s main contribution has been to\r\nstrengthen legal cooperation in the fight against\r\nterrorism. At the same time, we stand firm in our\r\nopposition to the death penalty in these and all other\r\ncircumstances.\r\nNor has the Council of Europe confined its\r\nconcerns to Europe. We take an active interest in\r\ndevelopments in and among our neighbours to the East,\r\nin the Middle East and in North Africa, and, through\r\nthe work of our North-South Centre in Lisbon, in the\r\nrest of the world as well.\r\nI am confident that in the coming months and\r\nyears, the Council of Europe will continue to work\r\nalongside the United Nations on the challenges before\r\nus. The Council of Europe’s work is the work of the\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nUnited Nations. Our values are the values of the United\r\nNations. Our goals are the goals of the United Nations.\r\nIn the Council of Europe, we will continue to look to\r\nthe United Nations for support and inspiration. And we\r\nhope that we can give the same in return.\r\nMr. Toscano-Amores (Ecuador) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The creation of the Latin American\r\nEconomic System on 17 October 1975 took place in an\r\ninternational environment dominated by bipolar\r\nconfrontation, in the midst of which Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean sought to equip themselves with a truly\r\nregional organization under the exclusive control and\r\nmanagement of the countries of the region.\r\nIn order to ensure for themselves active\r\nparticipation and an international presence, Latin\r\nAmerica and the Caribbean vitally needed to assert\r\ntheir own identity and personality and to undertake an\r\nindependent critical analysis. It also needed to set up a\r\npermanent system of economic cooperation, interacting\r\nwith international agencies, third countries or regional\r\ngroups of countries, and to establish a guiding body in\r\nthe joint negotiations that might potentially involve\r\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\r\nAs it came into being, the Latin American\r\nEconomic System set up to create such a space in the\r\nregion, because the international economic landscape\r\nhad proved to be adverse to the needs of our countries.\r\nThe international economic relations that developed\r\nfollowing the Second World War, marked by the\r\nimbalances and inequities repeatedly alluded to by\r\ndeveloping countries in this and other forums,\r\nunderwent changes during the 1980s and 1990s.\r\nRegrettably, those changes did not mean correcting\r\nthose imbalances; rather, they consolidated them in a\r\npattern of economic and political blocs in which the\r\ndecision-making capacity was concentrated in a few\r\ncountries.\r\nAll of this indicates the grave obstacles that the\r\ncountries of the Latin American region face in\r\novercoming poverty and underdevelopment. The\r\nconditionality implicit in stabilization policies and\r\nstructural adjustment programmes tends to weaken the\r\nstructures of the States concerned, while economic and\r\ntrading openness is pursued in an international market\r\nriddled with protectionist barriers imposed by the\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nThese conditionalities and structural adjustments\r\nimposed by the international financial agencies have\r\nbegun to have a harmful impact on our socio-political\r\nstructures. Regional democratic systems have had and\r\ncontinue to face profound and intractable economic\r\ncrises while social discontent has grown. As these\r\nattempts fail, the very democratic governance of the\r\nregion totters dangerously; such deterioration cannot\r\ncontinue indefinitely, because there is a genuine danger\r\nof collapse.\r\nWe must therefore ask ourselves what course to\r\ntake in addressing these challenges. There is no easy\r\nanswer because, unfortunately, it depends not only on\r\ncountries’ striving to find the path to development, but\r\nalso on the support offered by the developed countries\r\npossessing financial and technological resources.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, SELA’s validity is all the\r\nmore necessary, as is its interaction with other\r\nmultilateral forums for debate and concertation,\r\nespecially the United Nations. As has been said, one of\r\nSELA’s objectives is to promote a system of\r\nconsultation and coordination in order to develop\r\ncommon regional positions and strategies vis-à-vis\r\nother countries, forums and international agencies, as\r\nwell as to promote Latin American integration. In this\r\nregard, cooperation with the United Nations system is\r\nalso essential, since it encompasses multilateral\r\nagencies with convergent and complementary\r\nobjectives at the regional and global levels.\r\nOne feature of the current world order is the lack\r\nof alternative academic and political debate. In this\r\nrespect, there is a need for an increase in the quality\r\nand quantity of the cooperation of the Economic\r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean\r\n(ECLAC) in order to develop better mechanisms of\r\ninformation exchange, reciprocal attendance at\r\nmeetings and financial contributions to SELA\r\nactivities. Above all, however, Ecuador should like to\r\nsee SELA and ECLAC pool their capacities in order to\r\nreinvigorate the academic and political debate on the\r\nurgent need for a fairer and more equitable new world\r\norder, because the social turmoil in our continent\r\nreflects a disenchantment with and intolerance of the\r\ncurrent world situation and urgently calls for effective\r\nalternatives to overcome the structural crises that, since\r\nthe 1980s, have undermined the capacities and well-\r\nbeing of our peoples.\r\nSimilarly, complementary action between SELA\r\nand the agencies of the United Nations system will be\r\nimportant in securing firm support for technical and\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\neconomic cooperation among developing countries that\r\nis complementary with but not a substitute for North-\r\nSouth cooperation. This will optimize the rational use\r\nof resources stemming from cooperation and their\r\nimpact on national development efforts.\r\nThe Millennium Summit set 2015 as the deadline\r\nfor overcoming poverty. Since its endorsement by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, very few tangible steps have been\r\ntaken in that direction. Accordingly, it is a priority for\r\nthe entire United Nations system to work more closely\r\nwith regional organizations, including SELA, in order\r\nto achieve the targets set at Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg and to realize the aspirations of all\r\npeople to economic and social well-being, a basic\r\nelement in the construction of productive societies that\r\nare ready to co-exist peacefully in a fair and dignified\r\nlife now and in the future.\r\nMr. Kikaya (Kenya): Let me begin by extending\r\nto you, Sir, my deep appreciation for the excellent\r\nmanner in which you have conducted this session.\r\nMy delegation wishes to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report in document A/57/351 on agenda\r\nitem 22 (m) on cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the African Union, in line with General Assembly\r\nresolution 56/48 of 7 December 2001. Indeed, the\r\nadoption of that particular resolution was in keeping\r\nwith our collective resolve to enhance the role of the\r\nAfrican Union in all activities of the United Nations\r\nconcerning Africa, a position that Kenya is proud to\r\nassociate itself with.\r\nWe acknowledge the fact that the development of\r\nthe African continent will ultimately depend on the\r\nownership of development policies and commitment of\r\nthe African leaders and peoples. The cooperation\r\nbetween the African Union and the United Nations is\r\nexpected to assume fresh dynamism following the\r\nlaunch of the African Union by African heads of State\r\nand Government on 10 July 2002 in Durban, South\r\nAfrica. This important development launched the\r\nrevitalization of the organization both in orientation\r\nand institutional structure. In addition, the adoption of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development\r\n(NEPAD) as a programme of the African Union bears\r\neloquent testimony to the commitment and\r\ndetermination of our peoples in the pursuit of\r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe welcome the positive support given by the\r\ninternational community to NEPAD and especially the\r\nadoption by the General Assembly of the declaration\r\non NEPAD of 16 September 2002 and General\r\nAssembly resolution 57/7 of 4 November 2002 on the\r\nfinal review and appraisal of the United Nations New\r\nAgenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s\r\nand support for NEPAD.\r\nDevelopment can only be achieved in an\r\natmosphere of peace, stability and security. The\r\nescalation of conflicts in Africa has eroded\r\ndevelopment gains attained over the years. In recent\r\ntimes, it has been established that conflict situations\r\nare havens for the illegal exploitation of natural\r\nresources. To stem the tide of chaos, Kenya supports\r\nthe role of the United Nations in the area of peace and\r\nsecurity. We fully welcome any form of collaborative\r\nmechanism between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union in preventive diplomacy, particularly in\r\nthe operation of peace missions in Africa. My\r\ndelegation wishes to reiterate that Kenya will continue\r\nto participate in various peacekeeping operations\r\nwhenever called upon.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the efforts of the United\r\nNations in promoting peace in the Great Lakes region.\r\nWe support the deployment of United Nations\r\npeacekeeping forces in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and we remain confident that the United\r\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo will work closely with the\r\nAfrican Union under the framework of Lusaka\r\nCeasefire Agreement in realizing tangible peace.\r\nKenya has been in the forefront of the search for\r\npeace in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa regions,\r\nespecially in southern Sudan and in Somalia, as it is\r\nour conviction that no sustainable development can be\r\nachieved in an atmosphere of war and conflict. I\r\ntherefore call upon the United Nations to lend support\r\nto regional and subregional initiatives of conflict early\r\nwarning and response mechanisms with a view to\r\nenhancing our capacity in conflict prevention and\r\nmanagement.\r\nKenya reiterates the important role of regional\r\norganizations in conflict resolution, preventive\r\ndiplomacy and peacemaking. However, cooperation\r\nbetween regional organizations, including the African\r\nUnion, and the United Nations should be reinforced.\r\nHumanitarian and emergency situations in Africa\r\nseem to elicit a slow response from the international\r\ncommunity. Kenya continues to shoulder an enormous\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nburden resulting from the influx of refugees from\r\nneighbouring countries; we call for international\r\nsupport in alleviating that burden. The United Nations\r\nand the African Union need to collaborate in building\r\nAfrica’s capacity to mitigate both natural and man-\r\nmade disasters. Kenya would like to draw the attention\r\nof the international community, particularly the United\r\nNations system, to the need for Africa to be equipped\r\nwith a rapid response mechanism to disasters on the\r\ncontinent, especially in terms of disaster preparedness,\r\nprevention and management. We hold the view that\r\ninternational solidarity is necessary in the prevention of\r\nthe root causes of the problem of refugees and\r\ndisplaced persons, and we urge closer coordination and\r\nmonitoring of global efforts in addressing the entire\r\nrange of humanitarian crises.\r\nKenya is deeply concerned with the question of\r\nthe excessive availability, accumulation and illicit\r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons. These\r\nweapons threaten human security and hinder socio-\r\neconomic development and political stability. It is\r\ntherefore imperative that the global community take\r\ndecisive steps to alleviate this problem. Kenya\r\nreaffirms its commitment to work hand in hand with\r\nthe United Nations, the African Union and other\r\nregional organizations to stem this problem.\r\nMost African countries are still amongst the\r\npoorest in the world; out of 34 least developed\r\ncountries in the world 29 are from Africa. This calls for\r\nconcerted efforts to correct the imbalance. The\r\nimplementation of the commitments of the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries, the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development, the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and other United Nations conferences\r\nand summits holds the key to sustainable development.\r\nThere is no doubt that the process of globalization\r\nand the rapid transformation of the international\r\neconomic environment have contributed to the\r\nmarginalization of sub-Saharan Africa. We call upon\r\nthe United Nations agencies, in collaboration with the\r\nAfrican Union, to play a more effective role in\r\nreducing the negative impact of globalization. In this\r\nregard, regional integration in the promotion of\r\neconomic growth must be encouraged and supported.\r\nMy delegation is optimistic that the collaboration\r\nof the African Union and the United Nations in the\r\nimplementation of the development agenda for Africa\r\nand in meeting the targets of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration with respect to poverty eradication and the\r\nprovision of shelter will eventually realize sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Africa.\r\nMs. Pià Comella (Andorra) (spoke in French): I\r\nhave the pleasure of speaking on agenda item 22 (h),\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union”. Since the General\r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 56/46, and as\r\nindicated in the report of the Secretary-General\r\n(A/57/375), cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) has steadily\r\nstrengthened and grown. In that regard, we hail the\r\nleading role that the IPU has played in major\r\ninternational United Nations conferences. National\r\nparliaments, either through the IPU or because they\r\nwere represented on national delegations, were able to\r\nparticipate in making decisions about conferences texts\r\non sustainable development and security.\r\nOn sustainable economic and social development,\r\nthe IPU made an active contribution which enriched,\r\nfor example, the declarations adopted at the special\r\nsession of the General Assembly on children and at the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, held in\r\nJohannesburg. First, the IPU and the United Nations\r\nChildren’s Fund organized a parliamentary forum on\r\nchildren at which 250 of parliamentarians from 75\r\ncountries adopted a set of recommendations and\r\nmeasures designed to protect and promote the rights\r\nand well-being of children. Then, in accordance with\r\nan initiative of the South African Parliament, the IPU\r\nbrought together 300 parliamentarians from more than\r\n50 countries in order to adopt a parliamentary\r\ndeclaration which was subsequently presented to the\r\nJohannesburg Summit.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, the IPU has\r\nplayed a pioneering role in combating terrorism. At its\r\n106th Conference, on 11 September 2001, the IPU\r\ncondemned with the utmost energy the terrorist attacks\r\nperpetrated against the United States and subsequently\r\nadopted a resolution in which it invited States to\r\ncooperate in combating and preventing terrorism. That\r\nresolution also invited national parliaments to promote\r\nor endorse the United Nations anti-terrorism\r\nconventions.\r\nThe Principality of Andorra, with a parliamentary\r\ntradition going back to 1419, can only welcome the\r\nfact that the General Assembly, by resolution 57/32,\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\ninvited the IPU to participate in its work as an\r\nobserver. This will undoubtedly help to bolster\r\ncooperation between the two institutions.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to thank the Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Chile and his delegation for their\r\nwork in drafting and conducting the negotiations on\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.38. The Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Andorra told me personally that we would be\r\nsponsoring the resolution and that we would speak at\r\nthis meeting, stressing the importance of strengthening\r\ncooperation between Governments and parliaments in\r\nthe international arena of the United Nations. In\r\nAndorra we shall continue to actively support such\r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. erknys (Lithuania): Lithuania fully\r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the\r\nrepresentative of Denmark on behalf of the European\r\nUnion and associated countries.\r\nI would like first to thank warmly the delegation\r\nof Malta, the country which recently assumed the\r\nduties of the chairmanship of the Committee of\r\nMinisters of the Council of Europe, for the presentation\r\nof draft resolution A/57/L.23, on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe. At the\r\nsame time, allow me to express our appreciation to the\r\ndelegation of Luxembourg, which did a remarkable job\r\npreparing the draft resolution.\r\nSince 1989, the Council of Europe has enlarged\r\nits membership significantly and has integrated most of\r\nthe countries of Central and Eastern Europe; it has\r\nsupported them in their efforts to implement standards\r\nof democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\r\nWith the accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nearlier this year, the organization now counts 44\r\nmember States. In this regard, another important fact is\r\nthat in September 2002 the Parliamentary Assembly of\r\nthe Council of Europe adopted its opinion no. 239\r\n(2002), on inviting the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nto become a full member of the organization.\r\nThe Council of Europe remains the main standard\r\nsetter in the field of the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms in the\r\nEuropean continent. Therefore, continuous and\r\nincreasing cooperation between this regional\r\norganization and the United Nations, in particular the\r\nOffices of the United Nations High Commissioners for\r\nHuman Rights and for Refugees, UNICEF and the\r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Europe\r\nshould be supported by States members of both forums.\r\nThe Council of Europe has tremendous experience in\r\nhuman rights education and training and legislative\r\nexpertise, as well as experience in the elaboration of\r\nlegally binding international instruments in the fields\r\nof human rights, criminal law, environment and culture\r\nand in the social sphere. It is important that the Council\r\nof Europe legal space be open to participation broader\r\nthan only the membership of the organization.\r\nLithuania highly values the contribution of the\r\nCouncil of Europe to international action against\r\nterrorism, namely, successful elaboration of a draft\r\nprotocol amending the European Convention on the\r\nSuppression of Terrorism, carried by the Multi-\r\ndisciplinary Group on International Action against\r\nTerrorism. At the same time, it is important to stress\r\nthat the Council of Europe has elaborated and adopted\r\na set of guidelines on human rights and the fight\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nDuring the last decade the death penalty has\r\ndisappeared from many of the European criminal\r\ncodes. For this, tremendous credit undoubtedly goes to\r\nthe Council of Europe. Here, I wish to hail the adoption\r\nof Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on\r\nHuman Rights, which was opened for signature on 3\r\nMay 2002 in Vilnius. That document provides for\r\nabolition of the death penalty in all circumstances.\r\nRegional cooperation can make an essential\r\ncontribution to consolidating stability and security, and\r\nthe Council of Europe plays a significant role in\r\npromoting regional cooperation, inter alia cooperation\r\nbetween regional organizations, various initiatives and\r\nprocesses in Europe, and the United Nations. In this\r\nregard my delegation considers the Vilnius Declaration\r\non Regional Cooperation, adopted on 3 May 2002, to\r\nbe a very important document, guiding regional\r\ncooperation which could be used in other parts of the\r\nworld as well.\r\nThis year we witnessed the important event of the\r\nentry into force of the Rome Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court. Also the first session of\r\nthe Assembly of States Parties took place last\r\nSeptember. The role of the Council of Europe in\r\nfacilitating the entry into force of the Rome Statute and\r\nits readiness to provide States with the relevant\r\nassistance to become States parties are commendable.\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my\r\nconviction that cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Council of Europe offers promising\r\nopportunities. The contribution of the Council of\r\nEurope to United Nations initiatives on the peace-\r\nbuilding dialogue could be among prospective\r\ncooperation topics. Exchanges of information, views\r\nand good practices in fields of interest to both\r\norganizations at any level should be encouraged. In that\r\nregard, I would like to welcome the exchanges of views\r\non United Nations matters relating to human rights,\r\nwith the participation of experts from various States,\r\nheld annually in Strasbourg.\r\nAlso in this connection, the importance of high-\r\nlevel tripartite meetings of the United Nations, the\r\nCouncil of Europe and the Organization for Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe has to be emphasized. We\r\nthus strongly encourage a proactive approach and\r\ncloser cooperation among all delegations and\r\nsecretariats in New York, Geneva and Strasbourg.\r\nMr. Haneda (Japan): The importance of\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\norganizations, particularly in addressing issues of\r\nconflict prevention and economic development, cannot\r\nbe overstated.\r\nThis year we witnessed a truly historic event,\r\nnamely the establishment of the African Union (AU). I\r\nwould like first of all to comment upon cooperation\r\nbetween that regional organization and the United\r\nNations. The problems Africa is facing pose\r\ntremendous challenges not only to the region itself but\r\nto the international community as a whole. In order to\r\naddress these problems, Japan has consistently\r\nadvocated the importance of Africa’s ownership, that is\r\nits own initiatives and self-help efforts, as well as\r\nAfrica’s partnership with the international community,\r\nwhich supports such efforts.\r\nProgress in development cannot be sustained for\r\nlong unless the beneficiaries of development assume\r\nresponsibility for tackling the challenges. Thus,\r\nAfrican development must be initiated and led by the\r\nAfrican peoples themselves. But at the same time, in\r\norder to help ensure the fruitfulness of those efforts,\r\nthe international community, as an equal partner,\r\nshould respect and support those efforts.\r\nThe countries of Africa have clearly\r\ndemonstrated their ownership of the development\r\nprocess through the elaboration of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the\r\nestablishment of the African Union. Japan and indeed\r\nthe entire international community pay high tribute to\r\nthem for these efforts and achievements.\r\nI wish to emphasize that, hereafter, all\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union, as well as other regional and\r\nsubregional organizations in Africa, should be\r\nconducted in a manner conducive to encouraging and\r\nstrengthening Africa’s ownership. Japan’s\r\ndetermination to make every effort in that regard is\r\ndemonstrated in its plans to convene, in collaboration\r\nwith the United Nations and other international\r\norganizations, the third Tokyo International Conference\r\non African Development (TICAD III) in October 2003.\r\nLike development issues, the prevention and\r\nresolution of conflicts in Africa also require self-help\r\nefforts at the regional and subregional levels. Japan\r\nintends to continue to support the activities of the\r\nAfrican Union in that area as well by encouraging the\r\nappropriate use of the AU Peace Fund, to which we\r\nrecently made a contribution of $200,000.\r\nNext, I would like to comment on the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Asian-African\r\nLegal Consultative Organization (AALCO). My\r\ndelegation would like to commend the President of the\r\norganization’s forty-first session, the Honourable\r\nSenator Kanu G. Agabi, and the Government of\r\nNigeria for successfully hosting the very fruitful annual\r\nmeeting of the AALCO in Abuja last July in their role\r\nas Chair. AALCO is a truly unique regional\r\norganization which promotes international legal\r\ncooperation; develops and disseminates expertise in\r\ninternational law by organizing annual meetings,\r\nseminars and workshops which focus on current issues\r\nin international law under consideration in various\r\nforums of the United Nations and other bodies; and\r\ncontributes to the process of codification and\r\ndevelopment of international law. Japan is confident\r\nthat the work of the codification of international law\r\nwill be greatly advanced by strengthening the\r\ninteraction between AALCO and the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to briefly comment on the\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU). With the adoption of\r\nresolution 57/32, we believe that the IPU, with its\r\nunique character as a world organization representing\r\nnational parliaments, will significantly strengthen the\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nparliamentary dimension of the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nMr. Kafando (Burkina Faso) (spoke in French):\r\nThe consideration of agenda item 22, entitled\r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and regional\r\nand other organizations”, is of great importance at a\r\ntime when the demands of globalization call for\r\nrational integration of the world’s activities.\r\nThe fact that so many institutions have expressed\r\nthe desire to establish organizational links with the\r\nUnited Nations provides indisputable proof of the\r\nvitality of our Organization, as well as real\r\nreassurances for us who are its privileged members.\r\nOur hope is that through that cooperation, the efforts of\r\nall those organizations will serve to strengthen the\r\nUnited Nations in its leading and central role of\r\npromoting peace and justice throughout the world.\r\nGiven the equal importance of all the\r\norganizations concerned under agenda item 22, and\r\nwithout intending to be arbitrary, we would like to\r\nfocus our attention on just a few of those organizations.\r\nI should first like to refer to the African Union.\r\nTo say the least, the challenges confronting\r\nAfrica are enormous. First of all, there are the political\r\nchallenges. In dealing with the demands of\r\ndemocratization and with social challenges —\r\nchallenges that are sometimes tribal in nature — the\r\ncontinent is also being constantly challenged by\r\ninternal conflicts and crises, most of which are\r\nassociated with the problems inherent in devolution\r\nand a State’s exercise of its powers. The resolution of\r\nthose conflicts, either through preventive means or\r\nthrough peacekeeping operations, requires the\r\nassistance of the United Nations. In that regard, it is\r\nonly right that we commend the role of the United\r\nNations in calming a good number of regional crises in\r\nAfrica. It is also important that we note the support of\r\nthe United Nations for the democratization process, in\r\nparticular in the area of providing electoral assistance\r\nto African countries.\r\nWith regard to economic challenges, the African\r\nUnion expects a great deal from the United Nations in\r\nhelping it to combat poverty, in accordance with the\r\ncommitments set out in the Millennium Declaration.\r\nCooperation with the United Nations will always be\r\nessential, whether with regard to the implementation of\r\nthe New Partnership for Africa’s Development,\r\nstemming the negative effects of globalization or\r\nmaking efforts to achieve sustainable development.\r\nWith regard to social and humanitarian concerns,\r\nthe African Union is aware of the fact that a solution to\r\nthe negative impact of the major epidemics ravaging\r\nAfrica — in particular HIV/AIDS and malaria — as\r\nwell as to many social constraints and problems —\r\nsuch as those associated with refugees, respect for\r\nhuman rights and improving the status of women and\r\nchildren — necessarily require partnership with the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTo end my comments on the subject of the\r\nAfrican Union, I would like to take advantage of this\r\nopportunity to congratulate the members of the\r\nPermanent Observer Mission of the African Union to\r\nthe United Nations, who are primarily responsible for\r\nthe cooperation between the Union and the\r\nOrganization. I would like in particular to encourage\r\nthem, for we know that, as they do not enjoy\r\ndiplomatic status, they work under unenviable\r\nconditions.\r\nMy delegation stands in solidarity with the\r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of\r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the African Union. My\r\ndelegation has no doubt that the Assembly will give\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.39 its genuine and\r\noverwhelming support.\r\nI should now like to turn to the subject of\r\ncooperation with the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie (IOF). The IOF has proven its credibility\r\nas a cultural and linguistic instrument in the service of\r\ninternational cooperation. Founded under its current\r\nacronym just a few years ago, the IOF has since\r\ndemonstrated remarkable dynamism and vitality given\r\nthat its sphere is constantly expanding and its activities\r\ncontinue to become diversified.\r\nAbove all, the IOF is now an essential participant\r\nin the search for peace, the solving of crises and the\r\nstrengthening of democratic institutions, not to mention\r\nits training assistance and its efforts at promoting\r\nhuman rights, among other things. Strengthening\r\nrelations between the United Nations and the IOF, both\r\nof which pursue the same goals and objectives, is\r\ntherefore a logical step.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to\r\ncongratulate the leaders of the Permanent Observer\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nMission of the IOF to the United Nations, who are the\r\nforce behind this dynamic policy of cooperation.\r\nGiven the merits of the IOF, we are certain that\r\ndraft resolution A/57/L.29 will be adopted by\r\nconsensus. I would also like to conclude my comments\r\nin this regard by recalling that the next IOF summit of\r\nheads of State or Government will be held in Burkina\r\nFaso in 2004.\r\nI would now like to say a few words about the\r\nInter-Parliamentary Union (IPU). The Assembly will\r\nrecall that, for the last two years, my country has been\r\namong those vigorously calling for the IPU to be\r\ngranted observer status at the United Nations. That has\r\nnow become a reality. We are convinced that the very\r\nimportant step we have just taken will serve to further\r\nstrengthen cooperation between the two organizations.\r\nAs we all know, the Inter-Parliamentary Union is\r\nthe worldwide organization of parliaments of sovereign\r\nStates. Its statute very clearly indicates that it shares\r\nthe objectives of the United Nations. In fact, through\r\nits activities, the IPU is working towards peace and\r\ncooperation among peoples and the strengthening of\r\nrepresentative democracy. To those ends, the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union promotes contacts, coordination\r\nand exchanges of experience between parliaments and\r\nparliamentarians of all countries. It also considers\r\nissues of national interest and expresses its views on\r\nthose issues in order to stimulate subsequent actions by\r\nnational parliaments. In that way it is contributing to\r\nintensifying international efforts in favour of peace.\r\nThe United Nations is indeed aware of the advocacy\r\nrole played by the IPU in the search for international\r\nsecurity.\r\nStrengthened by its new status, the IPU will be\r\nable to take advantage of its special rapport with the\r\nUnited Nations to further shape and strengthen its\r\ncooperation with the Organization. The basis for that\r\ncooperation has been established by virtue of the\r\ncooperation agreement signed with the United Nations\r\nin 1996, in which the IPU noted the responsibilities of\r\nthe United Nations under the Charter and committed\r\nitself to continue to support the Organization’s\r\nactivities. The foundation for IPU-United Nations\r\ncooperation was also established through the\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between the Organization\r\nand national parliaments called for by heads of State\r\nand Government in the Millennium Declaration, as\r\nwell as through the Secretary-General’s report to the\r\nGeneral Assembly of 26 June 2001, which endorsed the\r\nIPU’s proposals on the role it could play to strengthen\r\ncooperation with the Organization.\r\nIt is for all those pertinent reasons that Burkina\r\nFaso fully supports draft resolution A/57/L.38. We are\r\na sponsor of that draft resolution, and have no doubt\r\nthat the Assembly will adopt it by consensus.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without\r\ncongratulating the leaders of the Inter-Parliamentary\r\nUnion, and its representatives in New York in\r\nparticular, for the results they have obtained.\r\nMr. Scott (Australia): I am pleased to be able to\r\nspeak briefly to this agenda item on behalf of the\r\nAustralian delegation. The range of sub-items grouped\r\nunder agenda item 22 provides clear evidence of the\r\nvery extensive network of cooperation and dialogue\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional and other\r\nentities. Australia is gratified by the constructive\r\napproach evident in these reports and in interventions\r\nthat others have made before me. We are also\r\nencouraged to see this item serve as a practical\r\nexample of the efforts of streamlining the work of this\r\nAssembly without compromising on the content of the\r\nmatters under discussion. We think it entirely\r\nappropriate that the issues under this item will be\r\naddressed in future on a biennial basis.\r\nAustralia has been pleased to be a sponsor of a\r\nnumber of the draft resolutions presented under this\r\nagenda item, including that of cooperation with the\r\nPacific Islands Forum, on which the Ambassador of\r\nFiji has spoken so eloquently on our behalf. As one of\r\ntwo full-time Australian parliamentary delegates to this\r\nGeneral Assembly, I would like to make a few remarks\r\nabout another draft resolution, namely on cooperation\r\nwith the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), introduced\r\nunder agenda item 22 (h).\r\nNotwithstanding Australia’s long history of\r\nengagement with, and support for, the IPU, Australian\r\nparliamentary delegates to the General Assembly in the\r\npast have expressed caution about the need for the IPU\r\nto be represented formally at the United Nations. This\r\nstems from our belief that the parliaments of IPU\r\nmember countries are in fact able to give voice to their\r\nviews through their elected Governments and their\r\nrepresentatives here in New York. That said, we note\r\nthat arguments made in favour of the draft resolution\r\nhave drawn attention to the particular nature of the\r\nIPU, noting its unique status as an inter-State body, and\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nhave stressed that granting it the right to circulate\r\nofficial documents at no expense to the United Nations\r\ndoes not set a precedent for others. We believe these\r\ntwo points are very important. At a time when the\r\nSecretary-General is trying to rationalize the agenda\r\nand the workload of the United Nations, we are not\r\nsure that adding to the list of potential documents\r\nwhich must be processed and digested, in particular by\r\nsmaller delegations, is necessarily going to help the\r\nstreamlining and reform of United Nations\r\nadministrative processes that we and many others\r\nstrongly support.\r\nNonetheless, we are encouraged by advice that\r\nthe volume of documents in question is unlikely to be\r\ngreat, and by the very strong support expressed by\r\nnumerous sponsors of this draft resolution. We\r\ninterpret this as a collective desire to make this new\r\narrangement operate efficiently to further the\r\ncooperation between the two organizations. It is on this\r\nbasis that Australia has joined the list of sponsors of\r\nthis draft resolution.\r\nMr. Huston (Liechtenstein): When we met a year\r\nago to discuss cooperation between the United Nations\r\nand the Council of Europe, the common fight against\r\nterrorism was the main topic on our agenda. Today,\r\ninternational action against terrorism is still a top\r\npolitical priority of the United Nations, the Council of\r\nEurope, and also of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), and therefore an\r\nimportant area where coordination and complementary\r\nefforts are essential.\r\nWe commend the important contribution made by\r\nthe Council of Europe through its adoption of\r\n“Guidelines on Human Rights and the Fight against\r\nTerrorism”. These Guidelines are designed to help\r\nStates find the right balance between the requirements\r\nof effectively protecting society and preserving human\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, an undertaking that\r\nis also at the core of the activities of the United\r\nNations. We are glad to point out that just this morning\r\nthe Third Committee of the General Assembly adopted\r\nwithout a vote and recommended to the plenary a draft\r\nresolution on the “Protection of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms while countering terrorism”\r\n(A/C.3/57/L.61), thus complementing the existing\r\nefforts of the United Nations system.\r\nFurther priority areas of Council of Europe action\r\nin the fight against terrorism complement and advance\r\nthe efforts of the United Nations. Preventing the\r\nfinancing of terrorism is one important example. The\r\nCouncil of Europe Select Committee of Experts on the\r\nEvaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures has\r\nbeen mandated to give high priority to the assessment\r\nof the implementation by member States of the Special\r\nRecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force\r\non the financing of terrorism. The work of this\r\ncommittee includes on-site visits and typologies\r\nmeetings, where financial and legal experts discuss\r\nprevalent money laundering methods, emerging threats\r\nand the development of effective counter-measures. At\r\nthe last typologies meeting, which was held in\r\nLiechtenstein at the invitation of the Liechtenstein\r\nGovernment, counter-measures against the financing of\r\nterrorism were the main topic. The acting head of the\r\nUnited Nations Global Programme against Money-\r\nLaundering (GPML) participated as a keynote speaker.\r\nHis contribution indicated the great potential for\r\ncomplementary action of both organizations in this\r\narea.\r\nThe OSCE, as a regional arrangement under\r\nChapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, has been\r\nclosely working together with the United Nations and\r\nits specialized organizations, in particular with regard\r\nto the global fight against terrorism. At the upcoming\r\nMinisterial Council meeting in Porto, Portugal, the\r\nMinisters will adopt a charter on preventing and\r\ncombating terrorism that recognizes the importance of\r\nthe work developed by the United Nations Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee and that reaffirms the obligation\r\nand willingness of participating States and the OSCE to\r\ncooperate with this Committee. The Charter recognizes\r\nthat the relevant United Nations conventions,\r\nprotocols, and Security Council resolutions, in\r\nparticular Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\r\nconstitute the primary international legal framework\r\nfor the fight against terrorism, and it reaffirms the\r\ncommitment of all OSCE States to become parties as\r\nsoon as possible to all 12 United Nations Conventions\r\nand protocols relating to terrorism. In turn, the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee and its Chairman have\r\nemphasized the importance of the role of regional\r\norganizations, such as the Council of Europe and the\r\nOSCE, and the relevant legal instruments under their\r\nauspices.\r\nAs stated in the report prepared by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/57/225), the Council of Europe and the\r\nCenter for International Crime Prevention continue to\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nshare common interests in combating transnational\r\norganized crime, trafficking, corruption, and terrorism\r\nin Europe. In addition to the promising steps already\r\ntaken, we welcome the suggestion made by the\r\nSecretary-General to further strengthen cooperation\r\nthrough information-sharing and better coordination in\r\nthe delivery of assistance. The establishment of a\r\nmechanism for information-sharing on request for\r\ntechnical assistance is an idea that should be further\r\ndeveloped. Such a mechanism would reduce the risk of\r\nduplication and help ensure the efficient and focused\r\nuse of the resources of both organizations.\r\nIn the area of trafficking, the OSCE closely\r\ncooperates with the Center for International Crime\r\nPrevention. The Ministerial Council meeting in Porto\r\nwill produce a roadmap for future coordination of these\r\nactivities.\r\nThe report by the Secretary-General provides a\r\nwealth of indications on the continued close\r\ncooperation between the organizations on the working\r\nand political levels. Since a unique feature of the\r\nCouncil of Europe is its parliamentary dimension, we\r\nwould like to express our satisfaction that during this\r\nreporting period there have been also exchanges\r\nbetween members of the Parliamentary Assembly of\r\nthe Council of Europe and high-level representatives of\r\nthe United Nations. We believe that such contact is\r\nespecially useful with regard to the assessment of the\r\npolitical and legal situation in certain countries.\r\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of\r\nEurope plays an important role in this respect, due to\r\nits mandate to monitor compliance of member States\r\nwith the commitments they entered into when joining\r\nthe organization. These commitments relate to the\r\nprotection of human rights, the rule of law, democracy,\r\nand protection of the rights of minorities. This\r\nmechanism of the Council of Europe considerably\r\nhelps to advance the ideals and values that are also\r\ndefended by the United Nations.\r\nIt was also the Parliamentary Assembly of the\r\nCouncil of Europe which strongly advocated the\r\nelaboration of an international instrument to prohibit\r\nthe abuse of the Internet for racist propaganda. The\r\nquintessential role of the Parliamentary Assembly, as a\r\ndriving force for new initiatives, has thus again\r\nproduced a tangible result. At its last session, the\r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe\r\nadopted an Additional Protocol to the Convention on\r\nCybercrime concerning the Criminalization of Acts of\r\na Racist or Xenophobic Nature Committed Through\r\nComputer Systems. This Protocol, the first of its kind,\r\nconstitutes an important element of the follow-up to the\r\nWorld Conference against Racism, Racial\r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,\r\nand gives a further example of the concrete\r\ncontribution of the Council of Europe to international\r\nefforts under the leadership of the United Nations.\r\nMrs. Ninčić (Yugoslavia): It is with pleasure that\r\nI take this opportunity to speak of the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe.\r\nBasic values shared by the United Nations, the\r\nOSCE and the Council of Europe include stability,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law and the promotion and\r\nstrengthening of human rights and fundamental\r\nfreedoms. All three multilateral organizations have for\r\nyears been involved in South-East Europe, both in\r\nstandard setting and the implementation of those\r\ncommon values. We would like to focus on the role of\r\nthese organizations from the perspective of the\r\nexperience of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\r\nMy Government would like to emphasize the\r\nfruitful cooperation between the OSCE and its Mission\r\nto the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, confirmed by a\r\nnumber of successfully completed projects and\r\nactivities. As a result of this cooperation, the Federal\r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia has been actively participating\r\nin the work of all OSCE bodies and organs and\r\nmaintains cooperation with the Office for Democratic\r\nInstitutions and Human Rights, the High Commissioner\r\non National Minorities and the OSCE Representative\r\non Freedom of Media.\r\nMy country is currently chairing the OSCE\r\nForum for Security Cooperation and has been actively\r\nengaged in the preparation of documents for the\r\nforthcoming OSCE Ministerial Council meeting, such\r\nas the OSCE Charter on the Prevention and\r\nSuppression of Terrorism.\r\nThe OSCE Mission in Yugoslavia was established\r\nnearly two years ago. The Mission’s mandate is to\r\nextend assistance and expertise to the Yugoslav\r\nauthorities at all levels, as well as to interested\r\nindividuals and organizations in the fields of\r\ndemocracy, protection of human rights, including rights\r\nof minorities, the rule of law and economic transition.\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nThe scope of the Mission’s activities encompasses the\r\nreform of the judiciary, public administration, the\r\npolice and the media. In all these fields, the role of the\r\nOSCE in helping our country overcome a difficult\r\nlegacy has been remarkable.\r\nThe prevailing, publicly stated opinion in OSCE\r\ncircles is that the OSCE Mission in Yugoslavia\r\nrepresents a new model of a mission for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. It was established by the invitation of the\r\nhost country, confirming Yugoslavia’s willingness to\r\nwork with and accept assistance from the international\r\ncommunity in efficiently implementing reforms.\r\nCooperation being a two way process, we have\r\nfound particularly valuable the relationship between\r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Mission,\r\nbased on dialogue and the full exchange of\r\ninformation. The Mission actively consults with the\r\ncompetent ministries, local experts and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, to the benefit of all\r\nconcerned.\r\nConfidence-building measures in South Serbia,\r\nimplemented in close cooperation with the\r\nCoordinating Center of the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia and the Government of the Republic of\r\nSerbia, are a distinctive segment of the Mission’s\r\nactivities, ranging from police training to engagement\r\nin local elections. Exemplary cooperation has been\r\nachieved between the United Nations and the OSCE in\r\nthis part of our country. The results are a model of\r\nsupport in stabilizing a fragile situation.\r\nWe would like to use this opportunity to express\r\nonce again our appreciation for the flexibility and\r\nexpertise of the OSCE in the complex tasks it has\r\nundertaken in our country and South-East Europe as a\r\nwhole. We look forward to our continued overall\r\ncooperation.\r\nMuch has been said in previous debates on the\r\nneed for better coordination between various\r\ninternational organizations and their missions.\r\nThe United Nations and the OSCE have\r\naccomplished admirable cooperation in Kosovo and\r\nMetohija, where the OSCE constitutes an essential part\r\nof the United Nations Mission in Kosovo.\r\nHowever, as on many previous occasions, we\r\nwould like to emphasize the necessity of cooperation\r\nbetween the two OSCE Missions in our country — the\r\nOSCE Mission in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\r\nand the OSCE Mission in Kosovo and Metohija. This\r\nwould doubtlessly make possible better results in\r\nprotecting minorities, returning refugees and internally\r\ndisplaced persons, resolving the issue of missing\r\npersons, as well as fighting terrorism and organized\r\ncrime. For the same reasons, strong cooperation is also\r\nneeded among OSCE missions deployed throughout\r\nSouth-East Europe.\r\nTurning briefly to the Council of Europe, my\r\nGovernment wishes to express its appreciation of this\r\norganization’s valuable contribution to the promotion\r\nof United Nations principles within South-East Europe.\r\nThis is done not only for these countries’ sake, but for\r\nthe security of the region and thereby Europe as a\r\nwhole.\r\nIn this context, we appreciate the role of the\r\nCouncil of Europe Mission in the Federal Republic of\r\nYugoslavia. We also welcome the engagement of the\r\nCouncil of Europe in developing a proposal for\r\ndecentralization in Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of\r\nEurope recently recommended the accession of\r\nYugoslavia to this organization. Our country has agreed\r\nto a series of commitments, declaring its readiness to\r\ncontinue its democratic reforms within the Council of\r\nEurope. Having neared the end of this process, we fully\r\nexpect to become a member well before the next debate\r\non this agenda item in the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to say that we welcome\r\nthe overall efforts of the United Nations, the OSCE and\r\nthe Council of Europe in assisting the Western Balkans\r\nto become just another region of a united Europe.\r\nMr. Khalid (Pakistan): This statement on behalf\r\nof the Pakistani delegation concerns cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization of the\r\nIslamic Conference (OIC) and cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and the Economic Cooperation\r\nOrganization (ECO). Pakistan has the privilege of\r\nbeing a founding member of both these organizations.\r\nThe Organization of Islamic Conference is one of\r\nthe largest intergovernmental organizations; its 56\r\nmembers and four observer States come from Asia,\r\nAfrica and Europe. As the collective voice of the\r\nMuslim world, the OIC has been engaged over the\r\nyears in a constructive and cooperative relationship\r\nwith the United Nations, reinforcing common efforts in\r\npursuit of peace and development.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nThe OIC has endeavoured to promote better\r\nunderstanding and dialogue between and among\r\ndifferent civilizations and cultures.\r\nIt has taken significant measures in fostering\r\npeace, in promoting social and economic development,\r\nin combating ethnic or racial intolerance and in seeking\r\nan end to the causes of injustice and instability, which\r\nare a constant threat to world peace and security.\r\nIn the aftermath of the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember, the Islamic world, under the auspices of the\r\nOIC, joined the international community in our\r\ncommon endeavour and fight against international\r\nterrorism. The OIC has been unequivocal in its\r\ncondemnation of terrorism. It has adopted its own\r\nconvention to deal with this scourge and that\r\nconvention represents a comprehensive framework\r\nwith a clear definition of terrorism, while upholding\r\nthe United Nations Charter’s cardinal principle of self-\r\ndetermination and acknowledging the legitimacy of\r\nfreedom struggles against foreign occupation and alien\r\ndomination. The OIC Convention on Combating\r\nInternational Terrorism offers a useful model.\r\nWe welcome the report of the Secretary-General\r\non Cooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, which\r\nrecapitulates the progress achieved during the past year\r\nby the United Nations system and the OIC in\r\npromoting their shared goals of international peace and\r\nsecurity and development. We also welcome the\r\neffective contacts and consultations that the two\r\norganizations have maintained over the past several\r\nyears.\r\nThe two organizations have regularly interacted\r\non a number of political issues, including Kashmir,\r\nAfghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the\r\nMiddle East and Palestine. Their mutually supportive\r\nrole and their determination to promote negotiations to\r\nresolve these conflicts continue to receive wide\r\ninternational support.\r\nCooperation between the two organizations has\r\nalso been increasing in a wide range of socio-economic\r\nareas of mutual interest. It is gratifying to note that a\r\ngeneral meeting of representatives of the Secretariat of\r\nthe United Nations system and the OIC was held earlier\r\nthis year in Vienna. Another meeting of focal points of\r\nthe organizations and agencies of the United Nations\r\nsystem and the OIC and its subsidiary organs and\r\nspecialized and affiliated units was held concurrently.\r\nThis formal interaction will further enhance\r\ncooperation between the two organizations. We are of\r\nthe view that the two sides should continue to examine\r\nways and means of further expanding and diversifying\r\ntheir cooperation by identifying new areas.\r\nPakistan has the great privilege of chairing one of\r\nthe two main committees of the OIC, namely the\r\nStanding Committee on Scientific and Technological\r\nCooperation, which is known as COMSTECH. The\r\nPakistan-based Committee is responsible for promoting\r\ncooperation in the fields of science and technology\r\namong Muslim countries. Pakistan is also host to the\r\nIslamic Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\r\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)\r\nis another major regional organization seeking to\r\npromote socio-economic development of its member\r\nStates on the basis of their common needs and in\r\nkeeping with the challenges on the global economic\r\nscene. The organization was founded by Pakistan, Iran\r\nand Turkey as the successor organization to the\r\nRegional Cooperation for Development. In 1992, it was\r\nexpanded to include Afghanistan and the newly\r\nestablished Central Asian States of Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan,\r\nas well as Azerbaijan.\r\nECO has played an important role in\r\nstrengthening and promoting multidimensional regional\r\neconomic cooperation among its member countries. It\r\nhas identified four priority areas for intense regional\r\ncooperation — namely, trade, transport,\r\ncommunications and energy. The project-oriented\r\nAlmaty Outline Plan underscores the importance that\r\nECO member States attach to the development of\r\ntransport and communications infrastructure linking the\r\nECO member States with each other and with the\r\noutside world.\r\nThe conclusion of two important agreements —\r\nnamely, the ECO Transit Trade Agreement and the\r\nECO Transit Transport Framework Agreement — has\r\ngiven further impetus to the expansion of regional trade\r\nand economic cooperation.\r\nThe ECO region covers a territory of more than\r\nseven million square kilometres and includes a\r\npopulation of nearly 350 million people. The region\r\nhas immense natural resources, and its members have\r\nthe political will to tap these resources for the mutual\r\nadvantage of all. With peace having returned to\r\nAfghanistan, ECO can serve not only as a vehicle for\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nthe post-war reconstruction of Afghanistan, but also for\r\ndeveloping and integrating the economies of the\r\nregion, which have borne the brunt of the conflict in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nECO already has in place the blueprints for the\r\nregion-wide development of transport and\r\ncommunications infrastructure, facilities for trade and\r\ninvestment, banking and insurance, culture and\r\neducation and effective use of the region’s vast energy\r\nresources. We expect the United Nations system and\r\nthe international community to support the efforts of\r\nthe ECO and its member States in order to realize these\r\nblueprints, not only for the benefit of the region, but\r\nalso for the world at large.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to express our hope and\r\nconfidence that the cooperation of the United Nations\r\nwith both the OIC and the ECO will continue to\r\nflourish to the mutual benefit of the organizations\r\nconcerned. Pakistan, as a proud member of the United\r\nNations, the OIC and the ECO, would remain actively\r\ninvolved in the work of all three.\r\nMr. Kulyk (Ukraine): It is my pleasure to\r\nparticipate in this joint debate on cooperation between\r\nthe United Nations and regional and other international\r\norganizations.\r\nFrom the point of view of the substance of\r\ntoday’s topic, we firmly believe that close cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations\r\nis a decisive factor in meeting the challenges faced by\r\nthe world community. Therefore, the importance of the\r\nright relationship between them, as well as an adequate\r\nlevel of understanding and mutual support, cannot be\r\noverestimated.\r\nUkraine notes with satisfaction the increasing\r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE). Among the major achievements, I would like\r\nfirst of all to mention the coordinated actions in the\r\nfight against international terrorism. We believe that\r\nthe OSCE Charter on Preventing and Combating\r\nTerrorism to be adopted at the forthcoming OSCE\r\nMinisterial meeting in Porto will become another\r\nsignificant contribution made by the OSCE to United\r\nNations-led international efforts in this sphere.\r\nWe also believe that the United Nations-OSCE\r\ndialogue should be further strengthened through joint\r\nendeavours to elaborate a comprehensive strategy for\r\nconflict prevention on the basis of the wide use of\r\npreventive diplomacy and peace-building efforts.\r\nMy country supports all the constructive steps\r\ntaken to foster coordination and synergy between the\r\nUnited Nations and the OSCE, aimed at bringing peace\r\nand stability to the areas in the OSCE region\r\nchallenged by security threats.\r\nIn this regard, let me also welcome the positive\r\ndevelopments in cooperation between the United\r\nNations and the Council of Europe. In particular, we\r\nare pleased with their steady involvement in the\r\nprocess of post-conflict rehabilitation and\r\nstrengthening of the rule of law in South-Eastern\r\nEurope. For its part, Ukraine remains ready to further\r\ncontribute to this vital process.\r\nMy country attaches special importance to the\r\nactivities of one of the oldest organizations, the Inter-\r\nParliamentary Union (IPU). Having reviewed\r\ncooperation between the IPU and the United Nations in\r\nthe past 12 months, we highly appreciate the\r\nachievements made to date. We hope that the invitation\r\nto participate in the capacity of observer, recently\r\nextended by the General Assembly to the IPU, will\r\nstrengthen cooperation with this important inter-\r\nparliamentary organization.\r\nThis year witnessed the historic birth of a new\r\nregional organization, the African Union (AU), which\r\nassumed the rights and responsibilities of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity. I would like to reiterate\r\nUkraine’s support for the African Union’s objectives of\r\nsecuring sustainable peace, stability and development\r\nin the continent.\r\nWe attach great importance to the strengthening\r\nof cooperation between the United Nations and\r\nregional and subregional African organizations in the\r\nareas of peace and security and political, economic and\r\nsocial development. Ukraine highly commends the\r\ncontinued efforts of the Secretary-General and the\r\nUnited Nations system in promoting such cooperation.\r\nAs the African Union is moving forward with the\r\ndevelopment of its institutional structures, it is\r\nimportant that effective coordination be established\r\nbetween the United Nations system and new\r\nmechanisms of the African Union. Particular attention\r\nin this regard should be also given to the effective\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nLet me conclude by commending the important\r\nrole of the International Organization of la\r\nFrancophonie in promoting and expanding multilateral\r\ncooperation in the areas of peace, democracy and\r\nhuman rights, as well as in the social and economic\r\nspheres.\r\nThe outcome of the Ninth Summit of la\r\nFrancophonie in Beirut in October this year clearly\r\nunderlined the importance of promoting the dialogue of\r\ncultures and civilizations and bringing peoples closer\r\ntogether through mutual understanding in the interests\r\nof consolidating peace, democracy and respect for\r\nhuman rights. I would also like to reiterate the\r\nwillingness of Ukraine, whose people fully share the\r\nvalues, goals and priorities of la Francophonie, to join\r\nthe activities of this organization as an observer.\r\nMr. Pfanzelter (Austria): Austria welcomes this\r\nsecond joint debate on cooperation between the United\r\nNations and several regional and other organizations\r\nunder a single agenda item. Austria would like to refer\r\nto the statement by the Presidency of the European\r\nUnion and add a few brief observations due to the\r\ninterest and special responsibilities that Austria has in\r\nregard to certain organizations.\r\nAustria has been actively engaged in the work of\r\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE) since the beginning of the process of\r\nthe Commission on Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope. We are honoured and proud to host this\r\norganization, which has proved itself an important\r\nactor in the field of conflict prevention, civil crisis\r\nmanagement and post-conflict rehabilitation. My\r\ndelegation would like to thank the Portuguese\r\nchairmanship for its untiring engagement this year on\r\nbehalf of the Organization.\r\nThe OSCE and the United Nations are close\r\npartners in the efforts for peace, democracy and\r\nprosperity. We must continue to strengthen this\r\nrelationship. Today’s threats to security and stability\r\nare of such a complex and diverse nature that no single\r\ninstitution or country on its own is able to combat them\r\neffectively. One example of the excellent cooperation\r\nbetween the OSCE and the United Nations is the effort\r\nin countering terrorism. After 11 September 2001, the\r\nOSCE adopted two far-reaching documents to prevent\r\nand combat terrorism: the Bucharest Plan of Action and\r\nthe Bishkek Programme of Action. Both require close\r\ninteraction between the organs of the OSCE and those\r\nof the United Nations, in particular the United Nations\r\nOffice for Drug Control and Crime Prevention in\r\nVienna.\r\nAs host of the Preparatory Commission for the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\r\n(CTBTO), Austria assumes a special responsibility for\r\nthe successful preparation of the entry into force of the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT).\r\nSince the Provisional Technical Secretariat of the\r\nCTBTO Preparatory Committee took up its work at the\r\nVienna International Centre in 1997, under its\r\nExecutive Secretary Wolfgang Hoffmann, much\r\nprogress has been achieved. The impressive number of\r\nsignatures and ratifications demonstrates the growing\r\nsupport for this Treaty: 166 States have signed, and 97\r\nStates have deposited their instrument of ratification.\r\nUnfortunately, the number of States whose\r\nratification is required for the CTBT’s entry into force\r\nis stagnating at 31. We must intensify our efforts to\r\nconvince the necessary countries to ratify the Treaty. In\r\nthis respect, my delegation underlines the importance\r\nof the third conference on facilitating the entry into\r\nforce of the CTBT, to be convened in 2003. This will\r\nbe the opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to\r\nthe CTBT and underline its importance in the context\r\nof nuclear non-proliferation.\r\nAustria appreciates the high quality of the\r\ncooperation of the United Nations with the Council of\r\nEurope. This is particularly true for the work of both\r\norganizations on the ground, inter alia: cooperation\r\nwith the United Nations Interim Administration\r\nMission in Kosovo in areas such as judicial and legal\r\ntraining, elections and the preparation of legislation;\r\ncooperation with United Nations Mission in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina regarding post-accession requirements\r\nand the legislative work with the Council’s Venice\r\nCommission; and the joint efforts in Georgia with the\r\nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Georgia, inter alia,\r\nto normalize the situation in the Gali sector and thus\r\nfacilitate the return of internally displaced persons.\r\nAustria supports the ongoing work involving both\r\nthe Council of Europe and the Office of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, both\r\nof which cover areas which are dealt with at the\r\nregional level by the Council of Europe. We are also\r\npleased to note that the Council of Europe played a\r\nconstructive role this year, both before and during the\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.55\r\nGeneral Assembly’s special session on Children and\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development in\r\nJohannesburg. I am confident that the Member States\r\nof the United Nations and States members of the\r\nCouncil of Europe will continue to support Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan and Secretary General Walter\r\nSchwimmer in their efforts to intensify the dialogue\r\nbetween the two organizations.\r\nBefore closing, I would also like to congratulate\r\nthe Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) for having\r\nformally received observer status in the General\r\nAssembly earlier this week. As a sponsor of both the\r\nresolution in the Sixth Committee on the observer\r\nstatus and the resolution under our current agenda item,\r\nAustria supports the special cooperation between the\r\nIPU and the United Nations. By including the IPU in\r\nits debates, the General Assembly will acknowledge\r\nthe voices of the elected representatives of our peoples\r\nand will benefit not only from their valuable\r\ncontributions on the issues but from additional\r\ndemocratic legitimacy.\r\nAs a host country to the United Nations and to\r\nvarious other international and regional organizations,\r\nAustria has stressed the urgent need for closer inter-\r\norganizational dialogue at the policy-making stage.\r\nConsequently, Austria initiated, together with the\r\nInternational Peace Academy (IPA), a process to\r\nanalyse, inter alia, cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations at annual seminars\r\nin Vienna. In July 2000, IPA and Austria celebrated the\r\n30th anniversary of the Vienna Seminar with a\r\ncommemorative session entitled “Sharing political\r\nspace in peacekeeping: The United Nations and\r\nregional organizations, the case of Europe”. The last\r\ntwo seminars focused on practical lessons learned in\r\nthe Caucasus and in Central Asia and on the\r\nimprovement of institutional cooperation in the future.\r\nAt the 2003 Vienna seminar we plan to take a closer\r\nlook at the prospects for cooperation between the\r\nUnited Nations and European organizations in peace\r\noperations. We hope that these annual seminars will\r\ncontinue to make a useful contribution to improving\r\ninter-organizational cooperation to the benefit of the\r\norganizations and their member States.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
