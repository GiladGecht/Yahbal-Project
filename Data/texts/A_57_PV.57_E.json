(Czech Republic)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mamba\r\n(Swaziland), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nReports of the First Committee\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nwill consider the reports of the First Committee on\r\nagenda items 57 to 73.\r\nI request the Rapporteur of the First Committee,\r\nMr. Mehmet Samsar of Turkey, to introduce the reports\r\nof the First Committee in one intervention.\r\nMr. Samsar (Turkey), Rapporteur of the First\r\nCommittee: I have the great pleasure and honour to\r\npresent the reports of the Disarmament and\r\nInternational Security Committee — the First\r\nCommittee — under agenda items 57 to 73 to the\r\nGeneral Assembly for its consideration and approval.\r\nThe Committee, under the chairmanship of\r\nAmbassador Semakula Kiwanuka, Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Uganda, considered 17 agenda items,\r\nwhich encompass a total of 36 items related to\r\ndisarmament and international security issues, in a very\r\nconstructive and efficient manner.\r\nOne can characterize the fifty-seventh session of\r\nthe First Committee as procedurally complicated, but\r\nsubstantively constructive, more focused and action-\r\noriented. I can say that the disarmament calendar for\r\n2002 has been eventful. During the session, member\r\nStates addressed issues ranging across the full\r\nspectrum of disarmament and related international\r\nsecurity agenda items. Most of the delegations that\r\nparticipated in the deliberations of the Committee paid\r\ntribute to the achievements of recent years, as well as\r\nexpressing their legitimate concern and their readiness\r\nto cooperate in tackling issues that should be addressed\r\nin the near future.\r\nAs in the past, the complexity of nuclear issues in\r\ngeneral, encompassing both nuclear disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation, continued to constitute the core of\r\nthe debate on international security. Among these\r\nissues, in general, those related to weapons of mass\r\ndestruction — in particular, nuclear disarmament and\r\nnon-proliferation; positive developments in the nuclear\r\narena, notably the Strategic Offensive Reductions\r\nTreaty between the Russian Federation and the United\r\nStates; and questions related to other types of weapons\r\nof mass destruction, such as biological and chemical\r\nweapons — continued to dominate the attention of\r\nmany delegations. Despite the persistence of\r\nconsiderable differences on certain specific substantive\r\nissues, there seemed to be consensus on many of the\r\nbroader and fundamental objectives of multilateral\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation issues.\r\nThe Committee had before it for consideration a\r\ntotal of 52 draft resolutions and 2 draft decisions that\r\nwere submitted under various disarmament and\r\ninternational security issues. It adopted a total of 50\r\ndraft resolutions and 2 draft decisions, of which 29\r\ndraft resolutions and 1 draft decision were adopted\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.57\r\nwithout a vote. One draft resolution, entitled “Effects\r\nof the use of depleted uranium in armaments”, was not\r\nadopted, and another resolution, entitled\r\n“Disarmament, non-proliferation and international\r\npeace and security”, was withdrawn due to lack of\r\nconsensus.\r\nIn this connection, I wish to state that the\r\nCommittee adopted five new draft resolutions on:\r\nbilateral strategic nuclear arms reductions and the new\r\nstrategic framework; reduction of non-strategic nuclear\r\nweapons; national legislation on transfer of arms,\r\nmilitary equipment and dual use goods and technology;\r\nmeasures to prevent terrorists from acquiring weapons\r\nof mass destruction; and promotion of multilateralism\r\nin the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. Of\r\nthese, three were adopted by a recorded vote and two\r\nby consensus.\r\nI would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to all\r\ndelegations for their spirit of cooperation in the\r\ncommon search for a better, safer and more stable\r\nworld. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude\r\nto the Chairman of the First Committee, Ambassador\r\nMatia Mulumba Semakula Kiwanuka, who, with his\r\nhigh diplomatic skills and vast knowledge of\r\ndisarmament and international security affairs, skilfully\r\nsteered the deliberations of the First Committee and\r\nenriched its debate with his vision and able guidance.\r\nI would also like to extend my cordial\r\nappreciation and thanks to the Vice-Chairmen of the\r\nCommittee, Ambassador José Nicolás Rivas of\r\nColombia, Mr. Jamal Nassir Al-Bader of Qatar and\r\nMr. Razvan Rusu of Romania, all of whom played a\r\nconstructive role in the discharge of our common\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nI wish further to thank the Secretary of the First\r\nCommittee, Mr. Mohammad Kasem Sattar, whose vast\r\nexperience and high degree of competence made a\r\nsignificant contribution to the successful outcome of\r\nthe work of the Committee. I would also like to express\r\nmy gratitude to Mr. Timur Alasaniya, Mr. Saijin Zhang.\r\nMr. Tam Chung, Ms. Ruby Kulanusorstit, Ms. Janett\r\nSerrano, Mr. Eduard Fesko and other Secretariat staff\r\nfor their valuable assistance in the preparation of the\r\nreports, as well as in the work of the Committee. Allow\r\nme to state that, as Rapporteur of the Committee, I had\r\nthe good fortune to become acquainted with the many\r\nunknown soldiers working diligently in the Secretariat,\r\nwho deserve our highest admiration and gratitude for a\r\njob well done.\r\nIn conclusion, I submit the reports of the First\r\nCommittee, as contained in documents A/57/501 to\r\nA/57/517, to the General Assembly for consideration\r\nand approval.\r\nThe Acting President: If there is no proposal\r\nunder rule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it\r\nthat the General Assembly decides not to discuss the\r\nreports of the First Committee which are before the\r\nAssembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Statements will therefore\r\nbe limited to explanations of vote or position. The\r\npositions of delegations regarding the\r\nrecommendations of the First Committee have been\r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the\r\nrelevant official documents and records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 of\r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is\r\nconsidered in a Main Committee and in plenary\r\nmeeting, a delegation should, as far as possible,\r\nexplain its vote only once, i.e., either in the\r\nCommittee or in plenary meeting, unless that\r\ndelegation’s vote in plenary meeting is different\r\nfrom its vote in the Committee”.\r\nMay I remind delegations that, also in accordance\r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, explanations\r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made\r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the\r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of First\r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that\r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same\r\nmanner as was done in the First Committee, unless\r\nnotified otherwise in advance. That means that where\r\nrecorded or separate votes were taken, we will do the\r\nsame. I should also hope that we may proceed to adopt\r\nwithout a vote those recommendations that were\r\nadopted without a vote in the First Committee.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.57\r\nAgenda item 57\r\nReduction of military budgets\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/57/501)\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly\r\nwishes to take note of the report of the First Committee\r\ncontained in document A/57/501?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 57?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 58\r\nProhibition of the development and manufacture of\r\nnew types of weapons of mass destruction and new\r\nsystems of such weapons: report of the Conference\r\non Disarmament\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/57/502)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on the draft resolution recommended by\r\nthe First Committee in paragraph 7 of its report.\r\nThe First Committee adopted the draft resolution\r\nwithout a vote.

the Secretariat that it intended to vote in\r\nfavour.]\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of\r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of\r\nagenda item 65?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 66\r\nGeneral and complete disarmament\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/57/510)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it\r\ntwenty-nine draft resolutions recommended by the First\r\nCommittee in paragraph 90 of its report. One draft\r\ndecision recommended is in paragraph 91 of the same\r\nreport.\r\nI now give the floor to the representative of\r\nIreland.\r\nMs. Murnaghan (Ireland): I asked for the floor\r\non behalf of the sponsors of draft resolution\r\nA/C.1/57/L.3/Rev.1, included as draft resolution B in\r\ndocument A/57/510. The sponsors of the draft\r\nresolution warmly welcome the accession by Cuba to\r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons (NPT) and its ratification of the Treaty of\r\nTlatelolco.\r\nWhen the draft resolution was adopted in the First\r\nCommittee on 25 October 2002, Cuba had signalled its\r\nintention to assume these obligations. However, all\r\nnecessary procedures could not be completed before\r\nthe First Committee concluded its work. The sponsors\r\nof the draft resolution are agreed that it would be\r\nappropriate to reflect these developments in the text to\r\nbe considered by the General Assembly. On their\r\nbehalf, therefore, I wish to propose a technical\r\namendment to the twenty-fourth preambular paragraph\r\nof draft resolution B. We propose that it be amended to\r\nread “Welcoming Cuba’s accession to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its\r\nratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco”. We ask that the\r\ndraft resolution, as now orally amended, be put to the\r\nAssembly for consideration.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Brazil.\r\nMr. Mourao (Brazil): Since the First Committee,\r\nby an overwhelming majority adopted draft resolution\r\nA/C.1/57/L.34, entitled “Nuclear-weapon-free southern\r\nhemisphere and adjacent areas”, Cuba has deposited in\r\nMexico City the instruments of ratification of the\r\nTreaty of Tlatelolco. With this decision, the ratification\r\nprocess of Tlatelolco is completed. We were also\r\ninformed in the last few days of important\r\ndevelopments regarding the South-East Asia nuclear-\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.57\r\nfree zone. All 10 South-East Asian countries, as\r\nenvisaged by the Treaty of Bangkok, have already\r\nratified this important Treaty. After consultations with\r\nsponsors and interested delegations on the possibility\r\nof amending draft resolution L.34 to reflect these new\r\ndevelopments, the Brazilian delegation proposes the\r\nfollowing amendments to draft resolution L.34,\r\n“Nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere and\r\nadjacent areas”.\r\nThe third preambular paragraph would read as\r\nfollows: “Welcoming the ratification by Cuba of the\r\nTreaty of Tlatelolco, which fulfilled the establishment\r\nof the first inhabited nuclear-weapon-free zone,\r\nencompassing all States of Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean”.\r\nIn operative paragraph 2, delete the words\r\n“Tlatelolco” and “Bangkok”, so that this paragraph\r\nwould read as follows: “Calls for the ratification of the\r\nTreaties of Rarotonga and Pelindaba by all States of the\r\nregion, and calls upon all concerned States to continue\r\nto work together in order to facilitate adherence to the\r\nprotocols to nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties by all\r\nrelevant States that have not yet done so”.\r\nOn behalf of the sponsors, we recommend to the\r\nGeneral Assembly the approval of this draft resolution,\r\nas amended.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of Japan.\r\nMr. Ishikawa (Japan): Subsequent to adoption of\r\nthe draft resolution entitled “A path to the total\r\nelimination of nuclear weapons” (A/C.1/57/L.42) by\r\nthe First Committee on 23 October 2002, the Republic\r\nof Cuba acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Japan,\r\non behalf of the sponsors of that draft resolution,\r\nwould like to orally propose that the draft resolution be\r\namended to reflect this new development. Therefore we\r\nrecommend that in the third preambular paragraph\r\namend “and welcoming the decision” to read as\r\nfollows: “and welcoming the Republic of Cuba’s\r\naccession to the Treaty”. Therefore, the third\r\npreambular paragraph now reads as follows:\r\n“Reaffirming the crucial importance of the\r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons as the cornerstone of the international\r\nregime for nuclear non-proliferation and as an\r\nessential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear\r\ndisarmament, and welcoming the Republic of\r\nCuba’s accession to the Treaty”.\r\nThe President: I now call upon the representative\r\nof Poland.\r\nMr. Lemanski: I would like to present an oral\r\ntechnical revision to draft resolution A/C.1/57/L.48,\r\nentitled “Implementation of the Convention on the\r\nProhibition of the Development, Production,\r\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on\r\nTheir Destruction”.\r\nWhen Poland and Canada introduced this draft\r\nresolution to the First Committee in October 2002, the\r\nnumber of States parties to the Convention was 145.\r\nBut, as all members certainly know, since then and\r\nbefore the General Assembly has taken action on this\r\ndraft resolution, two States — Saint Vincent and the\r\nGrenadines and Samoa — have acceded to the\r\nConvention, bringing the total number of States parties\r\nto 147. Poland and Canada would very much like these\r\nfacts to be reflected in the final text of the draft\r\nresolution. An updated third preambular paragraph\r\nwould then read as follows:\r\n“Noting with satisfaction that since the\r\nadoption of resolution 56/24 K, four additional\r\nStates have ratified or acceded to the Convention,\r\nbringing the total number of States parties to the\r\nConvention to one hundred and forty-seven,”.\r\nThe Acting President I shall now put the 29\r\ndraft resolutions A to CC and the draft decision to the\r\nAssembly one by one. We will take up the oral\r\namendments to draft resolutions B, P, U and Y when\r\nwe come to each of the draft resolutions. After all the\r\ndecisions have been taken, representatives will again\r\nhave the opportunity to explain their vote.\r\nDraft resolutions A to CC are to be found in\r\nparagraph 90 of section III of the report of the First\r\nCommittee.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A, entitled\r\n“Reduction of non-strategic nuclear weapons”.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Angola, Austria, Azerbaijan,\r\nBahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados,\r\nBelarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana,\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.57\r\nBrazil, Brunei

In the two years since the Assembly first\r\nadopted a resolution under this topic, a number of\r\nnational and international measures have been taken to\r\nfurther consolidate Mongolia’s external security and its\r\nnuclear-weapon-free status, which is reflected in the\r\nSecretary-General’s report on this item (A/57/159).\r\nThat is why, in the resolution just adopted, the\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\n“Welcomes the efforts made by Member\r\nStates to cooperate with Mongolia in\r\nimplementing resolution 55/33S, as well as the\r\nprogress made in consolidating Mongolia’s\r\ninternational security” (resolution 57/67, para. 4)\r\nand\r\n“Invites Member States to continue to\r\ncooperate with Mongolia in taking the necessary\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.57\r\nmeasures to consolidate and strengthen\r\nMongolia’s independence, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity, the inviolability of its\r\nborders, its economic security, its ecological\r\nbalance and its nuclear-weapon-free status” (ibid,\r\npara. 5).\r\nWe believe that the two studies to be undertaken\r\non Mongolia’s economic and ecological vulnerabilities,\r\nwhich are mentioned in the Secretary-General’s report,\r\ncould contribute to addressing the country’s economic\r\nand ecological challenges, and thus to strengthening\r\nthe basis of Mongolia’s unique nuclear-weapon-free\r\nstatus.\r\nAs resolution 57/67 outlines, Mongolia’s\r\nstrengthened external security and its nuclear-weapon-\r\nfree status serves to promote the aims of nuclear non-\r\nproliferation and to contribute to enhancing stability\r\nand confidence-building in the region.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to take\r\nthis opportunity to thank Member States, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the relevant United Nations bodies for\r\ntheir support and cooperation. Bearing in mind the\r\nimportance of the credibility of its nuclear-weapon-free\r\nstatus, Mongolia will do its utmost to institutionalize it\r\nat the international level. We will do so in the hope that\r\nthis innovative approach could prove to be useful to\r\nothers, including those in North-East Asia, so that they\r\nmay creatively address their broader national security\r\nconcerns in tandem with the creation of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly\r\nhas thus concluded this stage of its consideration of\r\nagenda item 66.\r\nAgenda item 67\r\nReview and implementation of the Concluding\r\nDocument of the Twelfth Special Session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/57/511)\r\nThe Acting President: In connection with this\r\nitem, the General Assembly has before it eight draft\r\nresolutions recommended by the First Committee in\r\nparagraph 25 of its report.\r\nMr. Loedel (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States would\r\nlike Cuba’s ratification of the Treaty of Tlatelolco\r\nreflected in draft resolution C, which is contained in\r\ndocument A/57/511. We would therefore like to\r\npropose an amendment to the sixth preambular\r\nparagraph. The paragraph should then read as follows:\r\n“Welcoming the ratification by the\r\nGovernment of Cuba of the Treaty for the\r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America\r\nand the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)”.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now put the eight\r\ndraft resolutions to the Assembly one by one. We will\r\ntake up the oral amendment to draft resolution C when\r\nwe come to that draft resolution.\r\nAfter all the decisions have been taken,\r\nrepresentatives will again have an opportunity to\r\nexplain their votes.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A, entitled\r\n“United Nations regional centres for peace and\r\ndisarmament”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution A\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nDraft resolution A was adopted (resolution\r\n57/87).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution B is\r\nentitled “Regional confidence-building measures:\r\nactivities of the United Nations Standing Advisory\r\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution B\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nDraft resolution B was adopted (resolution\r\n57/88).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution C is\r\nentitled “United Nations Regional Centre for Peace,\r\nDisarmament and Development in Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean”.\r\nMembers will recall that the representative of\r\nUruguay has submitted an oral amendment to the sixth\r\npreambular paragraph of draft resolution C. In\r\naccordance with rule 90 of the rules of procedure, the\r\nAssembly shall first take a decision on the oral\r\namendment to the sixth preambular paragraph of draft\r\nresolution C.\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.57\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt\r\nthe oral amendment to the sixth preambular paragraph\r\nof draft resolution C?\r\nThe oral amendment was adopted.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on draft resolution C, as orally\r\namended.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution C\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto adopt draft resolution C, as orally amended?\r\nDraft resolution C, as orally amended, was\r\nadopted (resolution 57/89).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution D is\r\nentitled “United Nations Disarmament Information\r\nProgramme”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution D\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nDraft resolution D was adopted (resolution\r\n57/90).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution E is\r\nentitled “United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and\r\nDisarmament in Africa”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution E\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do likewise?\r\nDraft resolution E was adopted (resolution\r\n57/91).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution F is\r\nentitled “United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and\r\nDisarmament in Asia and the Pacific”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution F\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nDraft resolution F was adopted (resolution\r\n57/92).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution G is\r\nentitled “United Nations disarmament fellowship,\r\ntraining and advisory services”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution G\r\nwithout a vote.

We would like, however, to\r\ntake this opportunity to once again draw attention to\r\nthe financial difficulties that the United Nations\r\nregional centres for peace and disarmament in Africa,\r\nAsia and the Pacific and Latin America and the\r\nCaribbean continue to face in carrying out their\r\noperational and administrative activities.\r\nGiven that they are funded by available resources\r\nand the voluntary contributions of Member States and\r\ninternational governmental and non-governmental\r\norganizations and foundations, the regional centres are\r\nnot always able to mobilize the financial resources\r\nneeded for their activities. In this rather gloomy\r\ncontext, we should like to commend the report on the\r\ninspection of the programme management and\r\nadministrative practices in the Department for\r\nDisarmament Affairs of the Office for Internal\r\nOversight Services, contained in document A/56/817.\r\nParagraph 77, under “Conclusions”, states:\r\n“One of the important and promising\r\naspects of the Department’s work is its regional\r\ndimension. While the revitalization of the\r\nregional centres is on track, their continuity and\r\nlonger-term viability are far from being ensured.\r\nAchieving a longer-term sustainability of the\r\ncentres would require resourcefulness, the\r\nteamwork of the entire Department and\r\npersistence in building up their financial\r\nresources and ensuring their continuity. That, in\r\nturn, would allow the establishment of core staff\r\nand secure the centres’ institutional memory. The\r\nOffice is of the view that such extra efforts are\r\nessential as the strong regional centres would\r\nprovide the dynamic hubs for the Department’s\r\nregional presence.”\r\nUnder the “Recommendations” of the Office of\r\nInternal Oversight Services, which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral seems to support, paragraph 94 states:\r\n“Given that the viability of the regional\r\ncentres is constantly threatened by a shortage of\r\nvoluntary contributions, and that their good work\r\nand usefulness are consistently recognized by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Under-Secretary-General\r\nfor Disarmament Affairs should request that\r\noperational support activities of the centres be\r\nfinanced, as required in each individual case,\r\nfrom the regular budget”.\r\nIn other words, instead of annually updating\r\nearlier resolutions regarding regional centres, we\r\nshould make greater efforts to fully fund all spending\r\non regional centres from the regular United Nations\r\nbudget. In so doing, we will truly demonstrate our\r\ngenuine support for the objectives of the United\r\nNations in the area of arms control and disarmament,\r\nas well as our appreciation of the active role played to\r\ndate by the regional centres.\r\nThat is the task that the delegation of Togo will\r\nundertake in the coming months, working closely with\r\nall those that support the activities of the United\r\nNations regional centres for peace and disarmament.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 67?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 68\r\nReview of the implementation of the\r\nrecommendations and decisions adopted by the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its tenth special session\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/57/512)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on the two draft resolutions\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.57\r\nrecommended by the First Committee in paragraph 9 of\r\nits report.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A, entitled\r\n“Report of the Disarmament Commission”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution A\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do the same?\r\nDraft resolution A was adopted (resolution\r\n57/95).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution B is\r\nentitled “Report of the Conference on Disarmament”.\r\nThe First Committee adopted draft resolution B\r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes\r\nto do likewise?\r\nDraft resolution B was adopted (resolution\r\n57/96).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the\r\nwish of the General Assembly to conclude its\r\nconsideration of agenda item 68?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 69\r\nThe risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/57/513)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\ntake a decision on the draft resolution recommended by\r\nthe First Committee in paragraph 7 of its report.\r\nA separate vote has been requested on the
