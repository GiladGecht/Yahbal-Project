(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of\r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hugo Chávez Frías, the\r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and\r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Chávez Frías (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nheroic people of Venezuela and its revolutionary\r\nGovernment greet all peoples and all Governments of\r\nthe world represented in the General Assembly of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI must begin by underlining the intense activity\r\nthat Venezuela has undertaken within the framework of\r\nthe agenda of the United Nations this year of 2002. For\r\nthat reason, we made the effort to come here to this\r\nmost timely session of the General Assembly.\r\nVenezuela began the year by assuming in January\r\nthe presidency of the Group of 77 and China. We\r\ncoordinated and managed that very important group of\r\ncountries of the world, primarily the countries of the\r\nthird world. First, we coordinated the preparations,\r\ndocuments, agreements and dialogues leading up to the\r\nMonterrey Summit, where we attended, speaking on\r\nbehalf of the countries of the South and especially on\r\nbehalf of the countries of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nVenezuela then continued that effort by coordinating\r\nour Group in preparation for the important\r\nJohannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development,\r\nheld a few days ago. The discussions at the\r\nJohannesburg Summit are still fresh in our minds.\r\nThis year, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nalso held the presidency of the Group of 15, another\r\nimportant group of developing countries fighting for\r\ngreater scope in the political, economic and social\r\ndomains.\r\nFinally, Venezuela has had a very intense agenda\r\nat the United Nations during this year of 2002, and in\r\nthe remaining months we wish to finish the year with\r\nan even greater intensity, making proposals,\r\ncoordinating actions and seeking decisions to complete\r\nand contribute our modest effort in the search for the\r\nsolutions, goals and objectives set out in this Hall\r\nduring the historic Millennium Summit of 2000.\r\nThus we come once again to this Hall to ensure\r\nthat the world hears the voice of millions of men,\r\nwomen and children who fight daily for their life and\r\ndignity by striving towards justice in the homeland of\r\nSimón Bolívar.\r\nTo begin, I would say that this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly is meeting amidst the suffering and\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nmourning afflicting the people of the United States, the\r\npeople and city of New York and all peoples of the\r\nworld, on this first anniversary of the heinous acts of\r\n11 September. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\r\nfrom the soul of its heroic people and from the heart of\r\nits revolutionary and democratic Government, prays to\r\nGod our Lord for the eternal peace of the victims of\r\nthose horrible events. It also reiterates its sentiments of\r\nsolidarity and condolences to their families. It affirms\r\nits condemnation of those who planned and carried out\r\nthose terrorist actions. We also offer our efforts in the\r\nfight against the scourge of terrorism in the world in its\r\nmost diverse facets and manifestations. However, at the\r\nsame time, Venezuela stresses the necessity of\r\nrecognizing the complexity of the alarming situation in\r\nthe world today. The direct condemnation of terrorism\r\nmust necessarily be accompanied  for ethical and\r\nmoral reasons  by an equally forceful condemnation\r\nof the causes and processes that have transformed the\r\nworld into an infinite sum of marginalized individuals\r\nand a reign of injustice, inequality and poverty. It is\r\nwritten in the Bible, which contains Gods words, that\r\nthe only path to peace is justice.\r\nThe resolute repudiation of terrorism must also be\r\naccompanied by an unreserved political resolve on the\r\npart of the leaders of the world to acknowledge, for\r\nexample, that todays international economic system\r\nfuels a process in which the perverse doctrine of\r\nunbridled neoliberalism leads to greater poverty,\r\ninequality and despair among the poor peoples of our\r\nearth.\r\nFor example, 17 people die of hunger every\r\nminute in the world. If we were to fulfil all the\r\ncommitments undertaken to combat poverty, it would\r\ntake us 130 years to eradicate it from the planet,\r\naccording to figures cited in the most recent report of\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme.\r\nThe condemnation of terrorism must go hand in\r\nhand with a decision-making process that will make it\r\npossible to make greater headway in the war  the\r\nwar, I stress  against poverty. For that reason,\r\nVenezuela has consistently advocated  first at\r\nMonterrey and then, more recently, at Johannesburg \r\nthat an international humanitarian fund should be\r\ncreated whose resources might come, for example,\r\nfrom a percentage of global military expenditure. It\r\ncould be funded by a percentage of the immense\r\nresources, those billions and billions of dollars, that\r\nwe, the developing countries, the poor countries,\r\nannually transfer to the developed world through the\r\nperverse mechanism of external debt  or eternal debt,\r\nI should say.\r\nI am sure that the countries of Africa and Asia\r\ncan tell the same story as we in Latin America do. In\r\nthe last 20 years of the twentieth century, Latin\r\nAmerica paid off more than twice the amount of its\r\nexternal debt. But now it turns out that we owe more\r\nthan when we began this whole perverse process.\r\nIt seems only fair to me that, given the situation\r\nthat faces the world and the bleak path that we are\r\nfollowing, this issue must be debated. Why not transfer\r\na portion of this eternal debt to an international\r\nhumanitarian fund  a fund that could also be\r\nfinanced by monies confiscated from drug traffickers,\r\nwho do so much harm in the world, and from corrupt\r\nindividuals who have walked off with billions of\r\ndollars from poor countries.\r\nVenezuela has a list that it will provide to the\r\npolice forces of the world. It will assist them in getting\r\nback billions of dollars and in transferring them to an\r\ninternational fund. Such a fund could also be financed\r\nthrough a tax that could be levied, quite justly, on\r\nmajor speculative capital transactions. There could be\r\nother possible sources as well; of course, this would\r\nrequire a very high-level political decision at the global\r\nlevel.\r\nToday, faced with the worlds tragedy, Venezuela\r\ninsists on this idea, and we ask the United Nations to\r\nengage in a debate on this issue. In Johannesburg, for\r\nexample, I recall that we began very interesting\r\ndiscussions in a number of round table meetings in\r\nwhich Venezuela participated. We discussed this topic,\r\nand I was very gratified to see a consensus emerge\r\namong the heads of State and Government present\r\nthere. I was very pleased with the support expressed for\r\nthat idea by the President of brotherly Brazil, Fernando\r\nHenrique Cardoso, who, during the Johannesburg\r\nround tables, commented on the need to create\r\ninstruments such as this, given that todays\r\ninternational financial agencies are not adequately\r\nequipped to combat poverty  a scourge that besets all\r\nof humankind.\r\nPresident Cardoso referred to the Marshall Plan,\r\nwhich was put into effect to assist Europe in the post-\r\nwar period. I think that today we would need hundreds\r\nof Marshall Plans around the world to save the\r\ncountries of the third word from hell and from death.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nBut just as we condemn global terrorism and its\r\ncauses, I have come to the Assembly also on behalf of\r\nthe valiant people of the Bolivarian Republic to\r\ndenounce out loud other kinds of terrorism and other\r\nkinds of causes. In Venezuela, we have seen the\r\nbeginning of a process of planned, systematic\r\nterrorism, which erupted in violence and blood also on\r\nthe eleventh  11 April, not 11 September  this year,\r\nthat is, five months ago. On that day, a fascist putsch\r\noverthrew the legitimate Government that I am\r\nprivileged to head, and installed, for an extremely brief\r\nperiod, a dictatorship that filled with fear the streets,\r\ncities and villages of our beloved Venezuela.\r\nWhat were the causes of that bloody terrorist\r\ncoup d’état, which resulted in the loss of dozens of\r\nhuman lives and wounded hundreds of people, who are\r\nstill recovering from their very serious injuries? Quite\r\nsimply, what we had was a democratic Government \r\na legitimate Government elected by the people; a\r\nGovernment that has committed itself to revolutionary\r\ndemocracy and to political, economic and social\r\nchange; a Government that has very resolutely and very\r\nseriously undertaken to put into effect the principles of\r\nthe United Nations; a Government that has undertaken\r\nthe task of carrying out social actions that will\r\ntransform society in order to bring justice and equality\r\nto our people; a Government that has doubled the\r\nbudget for education in less than three years; a\r\nGovernment that has doubled the health-care budget; a\r\nGovernment that has reduced by 10 per cent infant\r\nmalnutrition; a Government that has increased by 10\r\nper cent its peoples access to drinking water; a\r\nGovernment that has reduced infant mortality from 21\r\nper 1,000 to 17 per 1,000; a Government that has\r\nincreased by 30 per cent children and adolescents\r\naccess to free and compulsory public education. This is\r\na Government that has had to deal with the wild\r\nneoliberal privatization of health and education, a\r\nGovernment that began by reducing poverty and\r\nmarginalization in a country that is full of wealth but\r\nhas been governed by senseless elitists who were\r\ncompletely insensitive to peoples needs. A\r\nGovernment such as this was overthrown by a fascist\r\nalliance among privileged sectors, factions instigating a\r\ncoup d’état using media terror.\r\nThere is an issue in todays world that needs to be\r\ndiscussed in the world but few dare to do so; I would\r\nlike to be bold enough to discuss it. This issue is the\r\nuse of mass media in the world. Venezuela is a good\r\ncase to be studied. Mass media, exploiting the freedom\r\nof expression and the freedom of the press, supported\r\nthe putsch and manipulated society. The most appalling\r\nthing was that, when the people reacted against the\r\ndictatorship, the popular reaction was silenced and\r\nbroadcasting was stopped and nobody knew what was\r\nhappening in Venezuela. I think this is a special case of\r\nethics in media communications that deserves to be\r\nstudied.\r\nA little while ago, a great intellectual and Latin\r\nAmerican writer, the Uruguayan Eduardo Galeano,\r\nauthor of Open Veins of Latin America spoke of the\r\nquestion of mass media around the world and said this\r\ngreat truth: Never have so few deceived so many. We\r\nneed to tackle this with courage as we face the\r\nbeginning of this century. The elitist perpetrators of the\r\nputsch used the mass media and think they can\r\ncontinue to use them. They used police terrorism and\r\nmilitary terrorism and achieved a very powerful\r\nalliance that was successful in overthrowing the\r\nGovernment and succeeded in taking me prisoner and\r\nkeeping me incommunicado for many hours on a\r\nCaribbean island. This fascist coup eliminated the\r\nCongress, overthrew all laws and all public branches of\r\nauthority and did away with the judicial branch. It\r\nseized mayors and members of Parliament elected by\r\nthe population. However, in spite of all of this, they\r\ncould not oppress us. Within a few hours, something\r\nhappened in Venezuela that has scarcely ever happened\r\nin any country or nation. People began to rush out into\r\nthe streets, without weapons, with only the weapons of\r\ntheir courage and their hearts and with the Bolivarian\r\nConstitution in their hands. Millions of men and\r\nwomen and young people went out into the streets,\r\nclamouring for respect for their dignity and  miracle\r\nof miracles  in less than forty-eight hours, the\r\nGovernment along with patriotic soldiers overthrew the\r\ndictatorship, restored the Constitution, rescued the\r\nPresident who had been abducted and restored\r\ndemocracy to Venezuela. This was a miracle. Only a\r\npeople that is united can achieve this. Only a people\r\nthat is conscious and active can sweep away such\r\nfascist and terrorist assaults. This was the first time\r\nthat this was ever seen in any nation for a very long\r\ntime.\r\nMine is a people that has regained its libertarian\r\nessence and its liberating essence. A people that, since\r\nthe time of Simón Bolívar hardly two hundred years\r\nago, has worked together with Colombia, Ecuador,\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nPeru, Bolivia, Panama to achieve the independence of\r\nhalf of the continent of the Americas. This is the\r\nVenezuelan people for whom I, once again, reaffirm\r\nmy undying love and devotion for their courage and\r\ndignity.\r\nAnd here, from this rostrum, on behalf of this\r\npeople, I offer my sincere and warm thanks for all the\r\ngestures of solidarity that we received from here, from\r\nthe United Nations, from the Organization of American\r\nStates, from Governments and above all, from many\r\ncountries of the Americas. Messages came also from\r\nAsia, Europe, Africa and Oceania, because this was a\r\nunique situation at the beginning of this century. This\r\nconstitution is a revolutionary peaceloving and\r\ndemocratic document. It was drafted by the people\r\nitself and is now being defended and promoted by the\r\npeople.\r\nIn conclusion, following these events we in\r\nVenezuela are aware, we know  I realize that many\r\npeople do not yet know  we have experienced\r\nterrorism first hand.\r\nA few days ago a video came out, more proof of\r\nwhat was being planned in Venezuela. In that video an\r\ninternational journalist made some revelations, stating\r\nthat he was called in the morning on the day of the\r\ncoup and that, long before the first person fell dead as a\r\nresult of shooting by a number of snipers  there were\r\nsome foreigners among them  the coup perpetrators\r\nwere already recording a message in which they said\r\nthat President Chávez had ordered people to be killed\r\nand that there had been six deaths. Well before the\r\nfiring and the massacre of defenceless people began,\r\nthey had already recorded this message.\r\nUltimately, fortunately, the military and civilian\r\nreaction was very rapid, because the terror that had\r\nbeen planned against the Venezuelan people on a\r\nmassive scale would have meant that terrorist practices\r\nwould be applied against anything that was popular or\r\ndemocratic in Venezuela. They expected to repeal the\r\nConstitution. But, of course, it was restored within\r\nforty-eight hours because of the peaceful democratic\r\nrevolution brought about by the people.\r\nWe are grateful for the international communitys\r\nunequivocal condemnation of the coup d’état  the\r\nnightmare  that we experienced for some days in\r\nVenezuela. And we reaffirm that our Government, in\r\nwhich Venezuelans have placed their confidence in a\r\nnumber of successive democratic processes, will not\r\nengage in a witch hunt, or carrying out summary trials\r\nor executions. As the people say  there is a song they\r\nsing in the streets: Hes back, hes back, hes back.\r\nWith strict adherence to our humanitarian and\r\nBolivarian tradition and upholding our national\r\nConstitution, we came back with our Constitution in\r\nour hands on the popular tide that swept the legitimate\r\nGovernment back, along with the Constitution, and put\r\nan end to the terrorists, the coup d’état and its\r\nperpetrators. For the first time in Venezuelas history,\r\nvictory in a political conflict  and bear in mind that\r\nthis was the overthrow of a dictatorship  meant that\r\nthe Government that returned respected those who had\r\nbeen defeated.\r\nWe have now engaged in a major national\r\ndialogue, a national debate. In this we have also\r\nrequested the help of the United Nations through the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\r\nasked for support from representatives of the\r\nOrganization of American States. We have also\r\nrequested support from the Carter Center headed by\r\nformer President Jimmy Carter.\r\nWe are grateful for their support and we reaffirm\r\nthat Venezuela will continue to be guided by God and\r\nby the hand of its people, with the Bolivarian\r\nConstitution in its grasp. In doing so we will be joining\r\nthe world to contribute to seek out alternatives to the\r\neconomic models that have unleashed hunger and\r\nmisery upon the world. We will continue to make our\r\nmodest contribution, backed by the efforts of millions.\r\nWe will continue to make a supreme effort to change\r\nthe world and to make it viable so that, as soon as\r\npossible in the twenty-first century, justice will be\r\nachieved. For, as the word of God has asserted for\r\nthousands of years, justice is absolutely the only path\r\nto genuine peace.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Hugo Chávez Frías, President of the\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Ahmed Maher El Sayed, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\r\nMr. Maher El Sayed (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nwould like to begin by extending our sincere\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, both personally and as a\r\nrepresentative of the Czech Republic, on your election\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nseventh session. I am confident that, at this important\r\njuncture of developing collective global action, you\r\nwill steer the work of this session with your recognized\r\nability and wisdom, stemming from your countrys\r\nlong experience in confronting aggression and the\r\nhorrors it brings.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\r\ntribute to your predecessor, our friend Han Seung-soo,\r\nand to his country, the Republic of Korea, whose\r\npositive and effective role led to results that we aspire\r\nto consolidate.\r\nI cannot fail to express our deep appreciation to\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who for the past six\r\nyears has contributed his experience, wisdom and\r\nperseverance to reasserting the standing of the\r\nOrganization and the effectiveness of its role, and to\r\nstrengthening the principles upon which the Charter\r\nwas founded. He did all of that despite the inherent\r\nobstacles that were placed before him, either\r\ndeliberately or unwittingly, by those ignorant of the\r\nkey role of the United Nations in providing victors and\r\nvanquished alike an opportunity to benefit from the\r\ndevelopments of the age and to achieve the hopes and\r\naspiration of their peoples to a world that is safer and\r\nmore just for all. I wish to pay further tribute to the\r\nSecretary-General for the very courageous statement he\r\nmade yesterday before the Assembly, a statement in\r\nwhich he set out his very clear vision in addressing and\r\nresolving the worlds problems.\r\nOn behalf of Egypt, I would also like to welcome\r\nSwitzerland as the most recent member of the United\r\nNations family. We look forward to its active\r\nparticipation in the work of the Organization, along\r\nwith that of Timor-Leste, which will soon accede to\r\nmembership.\r\nThe current session has been convened one year\r\nafter the horrific tragedy that befell the United Sates on\r\n11 September 2001. We reiterate our condolences to\r\nthe United States. We also emphasize the sense of loss\r\nwe share with the families of the victims, and we wish\r\nthe injured a speedy recovery. We hope that this strong\r\nnation will overcome its ordeal and look towards a\r\nfuture of cooperation with the rest of the world, a\r\nfuture forged by all of us for the benefit of all the\r\ninhabitants of the planet, regardless of their race or\r\nreligion, without discrimination, intolerance or bias.\r\nEgypt has stood by the United States throughout this\r\ndifficult ordeal, whose target was not only a friendly\r\ncountry but also the values and principles to which we\r\nall adhere and which relate to respect for humankind\r\nand its right to life and to choosing to build rather than\r\nto destroy as the basis for joint action. In that regard, I\r\nwould like to briefly make the following points.\r\nFirst, notwithstanding the gravity of the tragic\r\nevents that took place on that sad day, the world neither\r\nbegan nor ended on 11 September. Many peoples have\r\nknown terrorism before. They have suffered from it\r\nand have resisted it  sometimes alone  in the face\r\nof hardship and even unjustified criticism. What is new\r\nis that the heinous crime of 11 September has\r\ngenerated an unprecedented wave of constructive\r\ninternational solidarity. It has confirmed what we have\r\nbeen stating all along: that terrorism is a global\r\nphenomenon and that it is not associated with any\r\nparticular country, continent, race or religion. It is an\r\nexpression of a propensity for evil that remains\r\ndormant until the opportunity presents itself, either\r\nfrom within or due to prevailing circumstances, for it\r\nto awaken and wreak havoc. Thus, it is important to\r\nrepeat the call that President Mubarak has been making\r\nfor a number of years; for the convening of an\r\ninternational conference in which participating nations\r\nwould shoulder their responsibility to confront\r\nterrorism. That would lend authority to the\r\noverwhelming wave of solidarity extended to the\r\nUnited States in its hour of grief and agony.\r\nSecondly, the fight against terrorism should not\r\nbe the lens through which the world views every issue\r\nand every problem. Terrorism is one of the evil\r\nphenomena of the world, but it should not cause us to\r\nforget the evils of poverty, disease, occupation, the\r\ndenial of individual and national rights or the\r\nhumiliation of human beings and the destruction of\r\ntheir livelihood by means of bombs or any other\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nsimilarly harmful means. Terrorism has roots and\r\ncauses, but not justifications. I believe that, in most\r\ncases, a viable remedy for terrorism can be found only\r\nif we drain the tributaries of hopelessness, anger and\r\nfrustration that feed the river of evil; otherwise their\r\nconfluence can become explosive.\r\nThirdly, it is both necessary and fair that we not\r\nconfuse those who are unjust with those who are\r\nunjustly treated. The international community should\r\nnot confuse terrorism  which we reject, condemn and\r\nfight  with the legitimate right of self-defence in\r\nconformity with norms compatible with our values: the\r\nright to defend oneself against aggression, occupation,\r\nthe usurpation of rights or attempts to erase cultural\r\nidentity. That right was exercised by the resistance that\r\nliberated the United States more than two centuries ago\r\nand by that which liberated Europe from the Nazi\r\ntyranny that initiated the Holocaust but ended by\r\nperishing in its fire. Humanity and right were thus\r\nvictorious.\r\nI would like here to reiterate what everybody\r\nknows: no religion  Islam, Christianity, Judaism or\r\nBuddhism  preaches terrorism. Those are all\r\nreligions that proclaim lofty values and ideals. It is\r\ninappropriate to blame them for the sins of a few of\r\ntheir followers who have gone astray. Our fight against\r\nterrorism should proceed from our collective solidarity\r\nin cherishing life, and not from hatred, which is neither\r\na solution nor a refuge.\r\nThe world is at an extremely delicate juncture in\r\nits history. We are at a crossroads in international\r\nrelations. The enhancement of the Organizations\r\ncapacity to respond to the hopes and aspirations that\r\narose after the end of the cold war and its divisions\r\ncoincided with a trend towards neglecting that very\r\ncapacity, a deepening of new divisions and a resort to\r\nunilateral decisions. Such a trend can lead only to\r\ndeadlock and prevent us from addressing issues that\r\nmay determine the fate of humanity and its ability to\r\nreconcile itself with nature and with advanced\r\ntechnology and to take the opportunities that they\r\nprovide for the achievement of a better life free from\r\npoverty, want, disease, oppression and fear  a life in\r\nwhich justice and solidarity prevail.\r\nWe must therefore break this deadlock, which is\r\nof benefit to no party or cause, by renewing our\r\ncommitment to the Charter and reaffirming our\r\ndetermination to work together to strengthen the United\r\nNations, enhance its effectiveness, promote its\r\nprinciples and champion its purposes in confronting\r\nboth the old and the new dangers that face our world.\r\nOne of these dangers is the persistence of hotbeds of\r\nconflict and violence in the world, including the\r\nconflict from which we in the Middle East are\r\nsuffering.\r\nI would like to read out the statement made\r\nyesterday by the President of Egypt, Mr. Hosni\r\nMubarak. He said:\r\nI listened attentively to the statement made\r\nby President Bush to the General Assembly, and I\r\nwould like to welcome the positive elements in\r\nthat statement. First, I welcome the affirmation\r\nby the President of the United States that the\r\nUnited States is committed to the establishment\r\nof an independent Palestinian State, side by side\r\nwith Israel, and that all the parties must assume\r\ntheir responsibilities in order to achieve that goal.\r\nWe hope that the peace process will receive a\r\nstrong impetus through effective participation by\r\nthe United States, leading to a return of stability\r\nto the area and to a just and comprehensive peace\r\nas early as possible.\r\nSecondly, with regard to Iraq, I welcome\r\nthe fact that the United States has opened the\r\ndoor to the pivotal role that must be played by the\r\nUnited Nations, in particular the Security\r\nCouncil, on the question of Iraq. Such a course of\r\naction will break the deadlock and prevent any\r\nnegative effects resulting from the escalation of\r\nthe situation, thus maintaining the sovereignty\r\nand territorial integrity of Iraq.\r\nIn view of this, I am calling on the Iraqi\r\nleadership to make use of this opportunity to\r\nimplement all the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions and accept the return of the inspectors\r\nimmediately so that we can prevent an escalation\r\nof the situation and the dangerous consequences\r\nthat would have a very negative impact on the\r\nsecurity and safety of the brotherly Iraqi people\r\nand of the Middle East as a whole.\r\nThe Palestinian people continue to suffer under\r\nan oppressive occupation that rejects the judgement of\r\nhistory, embodied by the Charter, that the age of\r\ncolonialism has long gone. It is an occupation that\r\nclings to policies reminiscent of those of the era of\r\ndarkness and chaos and may even bring us back to that\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nera. The Arabs have extended their hand to Israel with\r\na unanimously adopted initiative that reflects their\r\ngenuine belief in a peace that guarantees  without\r\nexceptions or double standards  the rights of all. If\r\nIsrael genuinely desires peace, it must abandon its\r\ngreed and illusions, put a stop to its practices and\r\naggressive acts against the Palestinian people and their\r\nlegitimate leadership and agree to withdraw from all\r\nArab territories occupied in 1967 in Palestine, Syria\r\nand Lebanon. An independent Palestinian State, with\r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, can then be established\r\nand can join all the Arab States that have demonstrated\r\ntheir readiness to establish normal relations with Israel\r\nand live with it in peace and security.\r\nJustice, right, mutual respect and the restoration\r\nto people of their rights were the building blocks on\r\nwhich peace between Egypt and Israel was established,\r\nsecuring safe borders and normal relations during the\r\npast 25 years. The other model, however, which Israel\r\nhas espoused with respect to our brethren in Palestine,\r\nhas achieved neither peace nor security; rather, it has\r\nresulted in victims on both sides, who fall each day,\r\npaying the price for an attempt to obstruct the natural\r\ncourse of events.\r\nThe international community must assume its\r\nresponsibility in this regard  without prejudice,\r\nstriving only for what is right; unswerving, moving\r\nonly towards justice; and without ambition, except for\r\na peace that will allow the peoples of the region to\r\nforge a better future. It must reaffirm the necessity of\r\nabiding by the Charter, United Nations resolutions and\r\nthe agreements that have been signed, and must reject\r\nany attempt to abandon them.\r\nThe debate on security and stability in the Middle\r\nEast relates also to the situation in Iraq  a situation\r\nthat must be dealt with in accordance with the\r\nprovisions of the Charter and relevant resolutions,\r\nwhich all parties must respect, steering away from a\r\ncourse of military action. Egypt reaffirms its rejection\r\nof military strikes against Iraq, whose unity and\r\nterritorial integrity must be respected and which, for its\r\npart, must respect the legitimate international will.\r\nWe must do everything in our power to put an end\r\nto the extreme suffering of the people of Iraq. We must\r\nend the embargo, which has inflicted great harm upon\r\nIraq, negatively affecting and the livelihood of its\r\ncitizens and damaging future generations.\r\nAny discussion of the United Nations, its\r\nachievements and its future would be incomplete\r\nwithout recalling the tangible contributions of the\r\nOrganization to focusing attention on the major issues\r\nof our times and forging an international consensus on\r\nsome of them. This contribution has been realized\r\nthrough a series of conferences convened during the\r\nlast decade of the twentieth century and the first years\r\nof this century on the environment, human rights,\r\npopulation, social development, women, financing for\r\ndevelopment and sustainable development. It has been\r\nachieved also through the recommendations of the\r\nMillennium Summit of the General Assembly, which\r\nattempted to shape a conceptual framework for the\r\nOrganizations work, based on peace and security for\r\nnations and individuals, economic and social\r\ndevelopment in its comprehensive sense, equality\r\namong States and respect for the cultural diversity of\r\nnations and societies.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to reaffirm the\r\nimportance of the faithful implementation, in both\r\nletter and spirit, of the outcomes of those conferences.\r\nIt is also important that no attempt is made to evade or\r\ncircumvent those mutual obligations. Ultimately, the\r\njudgement of history will be based not on the\r\nintentions or objectives contained in political\r\ndeclarations and final documents, but rather on the\r\nextent of our success in implementing them. their\r\nimplementation.\r\nAny just consideration of the international\r\neconomic situation must conclude that it is\r\nunacceptable to continue the present disparities in the\r\ndistribution of wealth among the peoples of the Earth,\r\nthe lack of democracy in international economic\r\ndecision-making and the persistence of arbitrary trade\r\npractices and monetary policies against the interests of\r\ndeveloping countries, which have often led to\r\nsuccessive financial crises and resulted in the economic\r\ncollapse of many developing countries and the\r\ndestruction, in a matter of days, of the development\r\ngains made over decades of arduous national effort.\r\nOur African continent and its issues occupy a\r\nspecial place in the international communitys efforts\r\naimed at achieving economic and social development\r\nand maintaining international peace and security in\r\naccordance with the collective responsibilities we all\r\nassume under the Charter. These efforts proceed from a\r\nfirm conviction that the United Nations, the Security\r\nCouncil in particular, has primary responsibility for the\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nmaintenance of peace and security in that continent.\r\nThey also proceed from our conviction that we, as\r\nAfrican States, are indispensable partners that bear a\r\nspecial responsibility to resolve the conflicts that\r\nfragment our continent and to formulate the\r\nprogrammes that would extricate our peoples from the\r\nanguish of poverty to join the course of progress and\r\nprosperity.\r\nOur continent has demonstrated its seriousness by\r\nlaunching the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which was endorsed by\r\nAfrican heads of State at the Lusaka Summit of the\r\nOrganization of African Unity in 2001, and the African\r\nUnion, which was inaugurated at the Summit held in\r\nDurban in July 2002. If by embracing these two\r\ninitiatives African States have adopted an approach to\r\nbuilding their future on the basis of the highest ideals\r\nreflecting the noblest human thinking, then the\r\ninternational community for its part should support that\r\napproach in order to provide a better life for Africas\r\npeoples, open markets for its products, inject foreign\r\ninvestment into its economies and assist it to solve its\r\nproblems.\r\nThe persistence of volatile conflicts and the\r\ndanger of the possession by States, organizations or\r\nindividuals of weapons of mass destruction make it\r\nincumbent upon us to be more diligent on disarmament\r\nissues. At the regional level, Egypt has repeatedly\r\ncalled for serious engagement to rid the Middle East of\r\nall weapons of mass destruction, first and foremost\r\nnuclear weapons, and to place all nuclear facilities in\r\nthe region, without exception, under international\r\nsupervision.\r\nPeace and security cannot be established in the\r\nMiddle East while a grave disparity persists in the\r\nrights and obligations of the States of the region, which\r\nupsets its balance of power. Regional stability will be\r\nachieved only when Israel accedes to the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), because\r\nit is the only State in the region that has not yet done\r\nso. Such stability will also be attained through progress\r\ntowards the implementation of President Mubaraks\r\ninitiative to rid the Middle East of all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and their delivery systems.\r\nIn addition, the world confronts other ills that\r\nrepresent both a challenge and an opportunity for us to\r\ndemonstrate our ability to work together for the good\r\nof all. Efforts to combat endemic diseases have fallen\r\nshort. Countries around the world suffer from the\r\nspread of HIV/AIDS, which threatens their stability;\r\nowing to their lack of capacity and resources they are\r\nunable to contain the pandemic, thus necessitating\r\nassistance for those countries in dealing with the crisis.\r\nThe world also confronts numerous\r\nenvironmental challenges such as those related to\r\nbiodiversity, climate change, drought and\r\ndesertification, all of which require the redoubling of\r\ninternational efforts to address them in order to\r\nsafeguard the right of future generations to a secure\r\nlife. Scarcity of water threatens the eruption of\r\nconflicts in several regions of the world. The\r\ninternational community must therefore maximize the\r\nbenefit from, and the proper management of, available\r\nwater resources while respecting and protecting the\r\nacquired rights of States and the international\r\nagreements that govern the rights to utilize those\r\nresources.\r\nThe sheer size, complexity and scope of all these\r\nproblems may lead some to yield to pessimism and\r\nfrustration, but we are confident that the forces of good\r\nin the world, armed with the noble principles of the\r\nCharter  to which we come here every year to\r\nreiterate our commitment  will remain resolute in\r\ntheir determination to fashion a better tomorrow. We\r\nare confident that humankind will overcome the\r\npropensity for evil so that together we can forge ahead\r\ntowards frontiers made possible by unprecedented\r\ntechnological progress at the outset of the twenty-first\r\ncentury, progress which God has commanded us to\r\ndedicate to our collective well-being so that the world\r\ncan live in peace, security, prosperity and harmony.\r\nThis will allow the young to flourish, potential to\r\nemerge, hope to overcome fear and pain, light to\r\nprevail over darkness and humankind to triumph over\r\nall that hinders its happiness, freedom and\r\nadvancement.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. S. Jayakumar, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Singapore.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): My warmest\r\ncongratulations go to you, Sir, on your early election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly, which was the first\r\nfruit of the revitalization efforts of your predecessor,\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo. We congratulate both of you on\r\nsuccessfully implementing these new procedures.\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nAfter the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001,\r\nthe world joined the United States in expressing grief\r\nand outrage. Citizens from nearly one half of the\r\nUnited Nations Member States perished. A swift,\r\ndetermined United Nations response set the stage for a\r\nunited global effort to weed out terrorism. Never in\r\nrecent history have so many States acted in such unison\r\nas members of one international community as they did\r\nin the months following 11 September.\r\nThat was not inevitable. The international\r\ncommunity could easily have fractured after 11\r\nSeptember . Hence, it is useful to reflect on the forces\r\nthat brought us together and on what key lessons we\r\nhave learned.\r\nAfter 11 September 2001, the international\r\ncommunity rallied together because we all realized that\r\nthe challenges posed by those events affected the\r\ncommon interests of all States. The common menace of\r\nterrorism elicited a cohesive psychological response.\r\nEveryone is vulnerable. In Singapore, we discovered\r\nterrorists belonging to a regional network with links to\r\nAl Qaeda, whose tentacles spread to Indonesia,\r\nMalaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and even Australia.\r\nIts targets were United States, Israeli, British and other\r\nforeign interests.\r\nBut a cohesive response also requires a\r\ngalvanizing force. The United Nations provided that.\r\nThe United Nations also legitimizes international\r\naction. On 12 September 2001, the Security Council\r\nadopted, by consensus, its resolution 1368 (2001),\r\ncondemning the terrorist attacks and expressing its\r\nreadiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the\r\nattacks. It was followed shortly by a consensus\r\nresolution of the General Assembly, resolution 56/1.\r\nWithin three weeks of the attack, the Security Council\r\nnegotiated and adopted, again by consensus, its\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), a landmark resolution which\r\ndealt comprehensively with counter-terrorism and\r\nprovided a common legal basis for all States to take\r\naction against terrorists and their supporters.\r\nThe Security Councils response to 11 September\r\nwas impressive and was possible only because all the\r\nmajor Powers agreed on the need to respond decisively\r\nto the terrorist threat. Indeed, the war on terrorism has\r\nreordered international priorities and has created new\r\nopportunities for partnership, casting a new strategic\r\noverlay over great-Power relationships.\r\nTerrorism is not a new phenomenon. Many of us\r\nhave long had unhappy experiences with it. But 11\r\nSeptember focused us on its globalized nature and\r\nstressed the need for coherence and coordination in\r\ninternational cooperation. After 11 September, a\r\nnumber of international, regional, subregional and\r\nnational plans of action and strategies to combat\r\nterrorism emerged. Some of these proposals took the\r\nform of specific and practical counter-terrorism\r\nmeasures. Others assumed a more normative character.\r\nThese efforts are the building blocks for coordinated\r\ninternational action against terrorism.\r\nThis commitment to collaborative international\r\naction, however, has only recently begun to take shape.\r\nSince 11 September, various organs of the United\r\nNations system have examined their respective\r\nresponsibilities and available tools so as to undertake\r\nthis collaborative mission in the most effective manner.\r\nThe report prepared by the Policy Working Group on\r\nthe United Nations and Terrorism is a clear example.\r\nCoordination and coherence within the United Nations\r\nsystem should certainly be enhanced. The common\r\nenemy we face has built up a sophisticated and\r\ncomplex global network that requires an appropriate\r\nresponse.\r\nBut as we consider new international mechanisms\r\nto fight terrorism, we should pause to reflect on a key\r\nquestion: how can we ensure effective coordination\r\nbetween the United Nations, other regional and\r\ninternational organizations and Member States? How\r\ncan we synergize respective international, regional and\r\nnational competencies to maximize operational\r\neffectiveness against terrorism? The United Nations\r\ncomparative advantage and aptitude reside in its\r\nconsultative, coordinating and facilitative functions.\r\nUltimately, however, the contributions made by\r\nthe United Nations must depend on the political will\r\nand resolve of its Member States to make its laws and\r\nnorms work. Achieving the right equilibrium of\r\nresponsibilities and obligations is crucial if we are to\r\nsucceed in our common mission to defeat international\r\nterrorism.\r\nThe battle against terrorism has also to be fought\r\nat the philosophical level. Some terrorists have tried to\r\ndepict the current global anti-terrorism campaign as a\r\nwar against Islam. This is obviously not true. No\r\nreligion tolerates terrorism, and Islam certainly does\r\nnot, but we should not ignore the extent to which the\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nappeal of extremists such as Osama bin Laden\r\nresonates with the marginalized and disenfranchised,\r\nfeeding upon stereotypes and prejudices. At a time of\r\nconfusion and uncertainty, the value of cross-cultural\r\nunderstanding and communication cannot be\r\nunderestimated.\r\nAs an international Organization with near\r\nuniversal membership, the United Nations can play a\r\nkey role in promoting tolerance and understanding\r\nbetween nations, cultures and religions. The United\r\nNations dialogue among civilizations is a key initiative\r\nthat we should build upon. The dialogue among\r\ncivilizations celebrates diversity and introduces a new\r\nparadigm of international relations, promoting a\r\ndialogue among the major world religions and cultures.\r\nDialogue between the different cultures and religions\r\nwould help to reduce the sources of prejudice and\r\nintolerance that currently colour individual and societal\r\nperceptions.\r\nAnother longer-term challenge is to address the\r\neconomic and social conditions that encourage\r\nterrorists. International economic integration is\r\nultimately the only guarantor of prosperity, but the fact\r\nis that globalization is both incomplete in scope and\r\nuneven in its distribution of costs and benefits. Many\r\ndeveloping countries remain imperfectly integrated into\r\nthe world economy. These problems must be addressed\r\nby capacity-building and infrastructure development\r\nwithin developing countries, with whatever\r\ninternational assistance is necessary, and by the\r\nelimination of trade barriers and protectionism in the\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nThe events of 11 September underscored that, in\r\nan interdependent world, no one is invulnerable. Local\r\nproblems can easily be transformed into global\r\nproblems. Each day that we do not act to address and\r\ncontain these problems increases their potential to do\r\nmore harm. Our collective security is dependent on our\r\nability and willingness to confront new challenges. We\r\nshould not await another catastrophe on the scale of 11\r\nSeptember before we are forced to act on other equally\r\nchallenging global problems that confront us. The war\r\nagainst terrorism has to be waged with both guns and\r\nbutter.\r\nI would like to conclude by sharing our\r\nexperiences on the Security Council. Almost two years\r\nago, members of the General Assembly gave Singapore\r\nthe honour and privilege of serving as one of the\r\nelected members of the Security Council. Our term\r\nends this December. I want to thank all those who\r\nshowed their trust in us by giving us this unique\r\nopportunity.\r\nOur experience has been a fulfilling and\r\nenriching one from which we have drawn important\r\nlessons and insights. The Security Council has gone\r\nthrough many phases. Designed first of all to deal with\r\ninter-State conflicts, the Security Council has\r\nincreasingly moved towards handling intra-State\r\nconflicts in the post-cold-war era. But the terrorist\r\nattacks of 11 September were an unprecedented\r\ndevelopment. They produced a new era, confronting\r\nthe Security Council with a new and distinct threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Singapore has\r\ntherefore served in two very different Security\r\nCouncils  one before 11 September and another after\r\nthose tragic events.\r\nFor the Security Council to remain effective, it\r\nhas to demonstrate that it can respond effectively to\r\nnew challenges. Otherwise, its relevance and\r\ncredibility will be compromised. As a small State, we\r\nare vulnerable to such terror attacks. As a member of\r\nthe Security Council, we have supported initiatives\r\nwhich address this new threat.\r\nA key lesson that we have learnt is that, for all its\r\nimperfections and occasional failings, the Security\r\nCouncil often does work. It is nevertheless too early to\r\ngauge the success and effectiveness of the Security\r\nCouncil in responding to the scourge of terrorism.\r\nWhether the Security Council can continue to develop\r\nappropriate responses over the long run at this plastic\r\nphase of the creation of a new strategic era will be a\r\ncritical test of its relevance in the new century.\r\nIt is naive to expect that the swift unity of global\r\naction post 11 September will henceforth be\r\ndemonstrated on all global issues. Our experiences in\r\nthe Security Council attest to protracted processes\r\nbeing the norm rather than the exception for coalescing\r\ninternational action. But where international consensus\r\nhas not yet consolidated over situations posing serious\r\nand immediate threats, the lack of international\r\nconsensus in itself cannot be an excuse for inaction.\r\nThat would be an abdication of individual and\r\ncollective responsibility.\r\nFinally, as one of two Asian elected members of\r\nthe Council, we were pleased to make a small\r\ncontribution to the East Timor success story. This\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nsuccess was made possible only by the hard work and\r\nsacrifices of its people, with the support of the\r\ninternational community. Today, the United Nations\r\ncontinues to play a critical role in preserving the peace\r\nin East Timor and in ensuring that the Government and\r\npeople of East Timor have the opportunity to succeed\r\nin their quest to build a democratic, stable and viable\r\nState. We look forward to welcoming East Timor as the\r\n191st Member of the United Nations.\r\nLet me conclude by warmly congratulating\r\nSwitzerland for becoming the 190th Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. Switzerland may be a new member;\r\nhowever, it has also provided the second most\r\nimportant venue for United Nations activities. It has\r\ntherefore long been a partner of the United Nations\r\nand, I believe, this partnership will be deepened with\r\nits membership.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-\r\nSabah, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Al-Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I\r\nam pleased to open my statement by extending warm\r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, and to your friendly\r\ncountry, the Czech Republic, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh\r\nsession. We wish you success at the helm of this\r\nAssembly, which is convened against a backdrop of\r\ncomplex circumstances and daunting global challenges.\r\nLet me assure you of my delegations full commitment\r\nto cooperating with you in order to facilitate the\r\nfulfilment of your mandate.\r\nI wish to extend a word of thanks and tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his prudent\r\nand efficient stewardship of the previous session. In the\r\nsame vein, I wish to reiterate our appreciation for the\r\noutstanding performance of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan and for his tireless and concrete efforts to\r\nenhance the effectiveness of the world Organization in\r\nserving global peace, security and development.\r\nKuwait welcomes the admission of the Swiss\r\nConfederation to the membership of our Organization.\r\nWe are confident that Switzerlands membership will\r\nenhance the benefits of its already active role in\r\nsupporting various United Nations programmes and\r\nactivities and will further consolidate the principles and\r\npurposes of the Charter, particularly as that country is\r\nhost to many United Nations bodies and specialized\r\nagencies.\r\nThe events of 11 September 2001 in the United\r\nStates, together with their consequences and\r\nimplications, have changed the global landscape and\r\nhave created a multitude of new challenges for the\r\nentire world, as we are now collectively entrenched in\r\nour fight against terrorism, violence and extremism.\r\nExperience has shown that combating this pernicious\r\nphenomenon is a universal responsibility and that no\r\nindividual country alone, irrespective of its resources\r\nor determination, can eliminate it.\r\nMoral and practical reasons make it unacceptable\r\nto link that curse to any particular nation, religion or\r\nculture. Such an attempt does not serve any of our\r\ncommon goals. To the contrary, it will deepen political\r\nand cultural divides, exacerbate the crisis and\r\ntransform it into a conflict among civilizations that\r\nharms us all and from which we have nothing to gain.\r\nTherefore, the United Nations remains the most\r\nappropriate and effective mechanism for studying and\r\nanalysing that phenomenon, so as to identify its causes\r\nand parameters and to coordinate efforts with a view to\r\ndeveloping guidelines for effective measures to\r\neradicate that plague.\r\nThe United Nations is also the appropriate body\r\nto define our responsibilities and obligations in that\r\nregard. The signing, ratification and scrupulous\r\nenforcement by all Member States of the 12 United\r\nNations instruments aimed at combating terrorism are\r\nperhaps the most viable means for establishing a solid\r\ncommon ground to combat and conquer terrorism.\r\nIn that context, I wish to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress once again our condolences and sympathy to\r\nthe friendly people and Government of the United\r\nStates and to the families of all the victims of that\r\nheinous act of terrorism. We share with them their\r\nanguish and the hope that their fortitude will help them\r\novercome their pain and loss.\r\nIn the meantime, Kuwait reaffirms its\r\nlongstanding core position condemning all acts of\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We also\r\ncategorically renounce all acts of violence and\r\nextremism, as they contravene not only international\r\nnorms and treaties but also the tolerant teachings of\r\nIslam and its compassionate value system, as well as\r\nother religions, humanitarian concepts and civilized\r\nvalues.\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nKuwait welcomes Security Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001) within the context of Kuwaits cooperation\r\nwith the ongoing international efforts to fight terrorism\r\nand, pursuant to its provisions, has put a number of\r\nimportant new steps and measures into effect. They\r\ninclude the enactment of a bill to combat money\r\nlaundering and the adoption of practical measures to\r\nregulate fund-raising activities in order to ensure that\r\nthose activities are not exploited or illegally used for\r\nany objective other than their legitimate and declared\r\nintent. Furthermore, for its part, Kuwait has answered\r\nall the queries of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee. We have provided to the Committee all the\r\ninformation and notations that clarify our national laws\r\nand legislation enacted by the Government to combat\r\nterrorist acts and to prosecute their perpetrators.\r\nWithin the same context and in order to\r\nconsolidate world efforts in combating terrorism, I\r\nwish to reiterate Kuwaits support for the idea of\r\nconvening an international conference under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations aimed at reaching an\r\nagreement on a clear and specific definition of\r\nterrorism. The primary purpose of that aim is to\r\ndistinguish between terrorism as a phenomenon that\r\nendangers international peace and security and the\r\nright of peoples to legitimate struggle in resisting\r\nforeign occupation in order to attain their rights to self-\r\ndetermination, as set forth in the Charter and in\r\ninternational law.\r\nIn this regard, Kuwait condemns the insidious\r\ncampaign orchestrated against our sister State, the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, by certain American and\r\nWestern media sectors. For our part, however, we pay\r\ntribute to the Kingdom for its valuable role and\r\nsignificant contributions to the fight against terrorism\r\nand to efforts to achieve peace and security in the\r\nregion.\r\nThe success of our global efforts to eradicate\r\nterrorism depends in large measure on the ability of the\r\ninternational community to effectively address major\r\nissues and challenges that have become a source of\r\ndespair, misery, frustration, isolation and perceived\r\ninjustice felt by a number of people in all parts of the\r\nworld.\r\nAn elusive challenge that continues to stand out is\r\nthe constant deterioration of the situation in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories. The escalating\r\nconfrontations have reached a level that threatens\r\npeace and security in the Middle East region as a\r\nwhole. The brutal practices of the Israeli occupation\r\nforces, including the unwarranted excessive use of\r\nforce against the Palestinian people, the deliberate\r\ndestruction of the institutions and infrastructure of the\r\nPalestinian Authority, in clear violation of United\r\nNations resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention\r\nof 1949, have resulted in exacerbating the economic\r\nand social crises sustained by the Palestinians for more\r\nthan five decades. Large-scale round-ups, house\r\ndemolitions, curfews, bombardment of civilian\r\nneighbourhoods, incursions into villages, town and\r\ncities and helicopter gunship assaults on civilians have\r\nbecome daily events for the individual Palestinian\r\ncitizen on the street. Indeed, those acts have become\r\nroutine stories in radio and television news.\r\nWe have silently resigned ourselves to that. It\r\nseems that the international community has been\r\nnumbed into accepting that way of life for defenceless\r\nPalestinians. But unfortunately all Israeli practices\r\nseem to be emanating from an entrenched precept that\r\nIsrael is immune to all accountability, exempted from\r\nall jurisdictions and shielded from all criticism and\r\ncondemnation by the United Nations or the worlds\r\nmajor Powers.\r\nAgainst that background, Kuwait reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the pan-Arab position adopted at the\r\nrecent Beirut Arab Summit, which endorsed the\r\ninitiative put forward by His Royal Highness Prince\r\nAbdullah Bin Abdel Aziz, Crown Prince of Saudi\r\nArabia and Chief of the Saudi National Guard. Kuwait\r\nremains committed to supporting the right of the\r\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to the\r\nestablishment of their independent State on their\r\nnational territory with Jerusalem as their capital.\r\nKuwait will continue to demand full Israeli withdrawal\r\nfrom all occupied Arab territories, including the Syrian\r\nGolan and Lebanese territory.\r\nWorld history and experience have amply\r\ndemonstrated that force alone, regardless of the degree\r\nof brutality, will not bring about peace and security.\r\nThe only viable option is restoring legitimate rights to\r\ntheir rightful owners and implementing peace. Perhaps\r\nthe best assurance for a secure future requires long-\r\nterm good-will investments in the present.\r\nKuwait welcomed with satisfaction the decision\r\nadopted by the most recent Arab summit, held in\r\nLebanon in March 2002, on the situation between Iraq\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nand Kuwait. In that decision, the Arab leaders\r\nwelcomed Iraqs pledges to respect the independence,\r\nsovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the\r\nState of Kuwait and to avert any action that might lead\r\nto the recurrence of the events of 1990. Arab leaders\r\nalso demanded that Iraq cooperate in finding an\r\nexpeditious and final solution to the question of\r\nKuwaiti prisoners and hostages and the return of stolen\r\nKuwaiti property as set forth in relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. But, to our deep regret, that\r\ndecision has not been implemented. The Government\r\nof Iraq has not as yet carried out its pledges, especially\r\nin regard to Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and\r\ndetainees.\r\nThat long-running humanitarian question can bear\r\nno further delay in view of its traumatic implications\r\nfor the families of the victims, who do not know the\r\nfate of their loved ones. The Iraqi Government\r\ncontinues to refuse to cooperate with the United\r\nNations mechanisms established to deal with the\r\nmatter. Assessing the approach followed by the Iraqi\r\nGovernment, the Secretary-General concluded in the\r\nfinal paragraph of his most recent report to the Security\r\nCouncil pursuant to paragraph 14 of Council resolution\r\n1284 (1999), contained in document S/2002/931 of 15\r\nAugust 2002, that\r\nDespite the encouraging agreements at the\r\nArab Summit in Beirut, Iraqs words on the fate\r\nof the missing persons are yet to be matched by\r\ntangible deeds. There still is a window of\r\nopportunity to address humanitarian issues, such\r\nas that of missing persons, in good faith. Iraq\r\nshould use this opportunity to restore its\r\ncredibility on the outstanding humanitarian\r\nissues. (para. 40)\r\nIn that context, Kuwait welcomes the efforts and\r\nsteps undertaken by the United Nations in preparation\r\nfor the return of Kuwaits State archives from Iraq\r\npursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nDespite the fact that Iraq has denied over the past 11\r\nyears that it had seized the archives, we consider its\r\nacknowledgement that it holds the archives and its\r\nintention to return them to be an important step\r\ntowards carrying out Security Council resolutions,\r\nparticularly resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991) and\r\n1284 (1999). Irrespective of Iraqs motives for\r\nreturning the archives and other Kuwaiti State\r\ndocuments, it is our hope that this step will be followed\r\nby other positive actions leading to the release of our\r\nprisoners and those of third countries. Only then can\r\nthis dossier be closed. I wish to stress here that the\r\nhumanitarian issue of our prisoners has dominated the\r\nnational agenda of the Government and the people of\r\nKuwait since liberation.\r\nRegarding other relevant issues, Kuwait has\r\nwelcomed the dialogue between the United Nations and\r\nIraq, and we hope that this exercise will lead to the\r\nimplementation of the rest of the key obligations,\r\nincluding the elimination of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and other outstanding matters.\r\nKuwait thinks that Iraqs strict and scrupulous\r\nimplementation of all relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions and the admission of United Nations\r\nweapons inspectors back into Iraq would spare our\r\nregion the horrors of a war which we do not want. Such\r\na war would only lead to the exacerbation of the\r\nsuffering of the brotherly people of Iraq and to the\r\nescalation of tension and instability in the region.\r\nKuwait also welcomes the prudent approach\r\noutlined by President George Bush of the United States\r\nin his statement before the General Assembly\r\nyesterday, in which he requested the Security Council\r\nto fulfil its legal and political responsibilities within\r\nthe context of relevant Council resolutions regarding\r\nIraq. The Security Council undoubtedly has the power\r\nto do so. We call upon the Security Council to perform\r\nthat legitimate role. Meanwhile, we demand that Iraq\r\nfully and strictly implement all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions in the interest of security and\r\nstability in the region and in order to avert the dangers\r\nit faces.\r\nBecause of its keen interest in maintaining and\r\nbolstering security and stability in our region, the State\r\nof Kuwait emphasizes again its support for all efforts\r\nto resolve by peaceful means the disagreement between\r\nthe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran over the disputed islands. In that context, we\r\nwelcome the mutual visits by ranking officials of both\r\ncountries. We hope that such visits and direct contacts\r\nwill help the parties to create a favourable climate for\r\nconfidence-building between the two countries.\r\nThe world economic landscape has been quite\r\nturbulent over the past year. Reports issued by\r\nnumerous specialized international institutions show\r\nthat many countries, including some developed\r\ncountries, have begun to suffer from a global economic\r\nslowdown. That in turn has led to mounting economic\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nand social burdens on many States due to growing\r\nimbalances and disparities between the economies of\r\ncountries of the North and those of the South. While\r\nthe countries of the North continue to enjoy economic\r\nprosperity and better standards of living for their\r\npeoples, countries of the South continue to suffer from\r\npoverty, famine, unemployment, environmental\r\ndegradation, severe shortages of drinking water and\r\nwidespread pandemics such as those of HIV/AIDS and\r\nmalaria, in addition to a whole range of other problems\r\nthat impede their efforts towards sustainable\r\ndevelopment. It is our hope that the decisions and plans\r\nof action recently adopted at the Johannesburg World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held at\r\nJohannesburg in August and September, and at the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, held in Mexico in February, will help\r\nbolster efforts and strengthen bonds of cooperation\r\nbetween the North and the South with a view to laying\r\nthe underpinnings of a new partnership that contributes\r\nto the stabilization and growth of economic relations\r\nand to establishing the basis for an equitable world\r\ntrade system that sets out the responsibilities and\r\nobligations of all sides.\r\nPerhaps one of the most pressing demands at\r\npresent to shore up the economic structures of the\r\ndeveloping countries is that the developed nations fulfil\r\ntheir obligation to provide meaningful financial and\r\ntechnical aid to the developing world. That includes\r\nbilateral arrangements and understandings with\r\ninternational financial institutions and organizations to\r\nalleviate the debt burden of developing countries and\r\nthe cancellation of the debts of the poorest nations.\r\nAlso, any tariffs or other obstacles to access for the\r\nproducts of those countries to developed countries\r\nmarkets should be removed. Furthermore, developing\r\ncountries should have easier access to information and\r\ntechnologies that would help them solve their problems\r\nand became integrated into the world economy. Such\r\nsteps would prevent the marginalization of the\r\ndeveloping countries and least developed countries and\r\nwould help put them back on the road to development.\r\nIn this regard, Kuwait draws satisfaction from the\r\nfact that it tops the list of Arab States on the United\r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) Arab\r\nhuman development index for the current year. The\r\nArab Human Development Report was published by\r\nthe UNDP in cooperation with the Arab Fund for\r\nEconomic and Social Development. The report drew on\r\na whole range of indices including health, education,\r\nacquisition of technical knowledge and per capita\r\nincome. The Government of Kuwait will be guided by\r\nthe reports indicators and, in cooperation with our\r\nNational Assembly, which is the legislative authority in\r\nour country, will maintain its efforts to improve\r\neconomic and social conditions to the benefit of\r\nKuwaiti citizens and their well-being.\r\nI wish to place on record our sense of pride in\r\ncarrying out all our international obligations. In\r\nparticular, Kuwait is a robust contributor to the\r\ndevelopment programmes of many developing nations.\r\nFurthermore, we are a vibrant player in ensuring a\r\nstable and balanced global oil market with a view to\r\nensuring equitable and universal economic\r\ndevelopment. Also, in line with its Arab and Islamic\r\nheritage and given the imperatives of kinship, Kuwait\r\nhas never hesitated to reach out to meet its full official\r\nand unofficial obligations towards the Palestinian\r\npeople in the Palestinian territories and towards the\r\npeople of Afghanistan. It is now our hope that the\r\nAfghan people, following the recent developments in\r\ntheir country, will be able to live in security and\r\nstability after their long and deep suffering due to war\r\nand internal conflict. Let us hope that the country will\r\nnow channel all its resources into national\r\nreconstruction in order to make up for those long years\r\nof conflict and hostilities.\r\nInasmuch as the peoples of the world differ in\r\ntheir religion, culture and ethnicity, they are similar in\r\ntheir aspirations, ambitions and hopes. We all seek to\r\nlive in freedom, dignity and safety. We all yearn for a\r\nworld in which peace, security and justice prevail.\r\nTranslating that vision and hope into reality requires\r\naccelerating the pace of concerted global action to meet\r\nthe lofty purposes and principles defined in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIn addition, the United Nations Millennium\r\nSummit Declaration must be translated into a concrete\r\nreality that satisfies the hopes and aspirations of the\r\npeoples of the world. We as countries believe that\r\nultimately we all are accountable to Allah, His name be\r\npraised and glorified, the Creator of the universe. We\r\nare also accountable to our peoples in terms of\r\nfulfilling their legitimate aspirations in a world of\r\nprevailing security and peace.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to Mr. Tang\r\nJianxuan, Minister for Foreign Affairs of China.\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nMr. Tang Jianxuan (China) (spoke in Chinese):\r\nFirst of all, Sir, please allow me to offer my warmest\r\ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency\r\nof the current session of the General Assembly. I wish\r\nalso to express my gratitude to Mr. Han Seung-soo,\r\nPresident of the previous session of the Assembly.\r\nI wish to congratulate the Swiss Confederation on\r\nhaving joined the United Nations and also to welcome\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, which will\r\nsoon become a Member of the Organization.\r\nThe opening of this session coincides with the\r\nfirst anniversary of the events of 11 September. Over\r\nthe past year, the international campaign against\r\nterrorism has made headway, and now we should not\r\nonly ponder ways to eradicate the global scourge of\r\nterrorism, but also take a broader view of the security\r\nissues facing humankind and seek to achieve lasting\r\npeace and universal security.\r\nAt present, the international security situation is\r\nundergoing profound changes. Security has begun to\r\ntake on wider connotations. While traditional military\r\nantagonism and conflicts have yet to be eliminated, a\r\nvariety of non-traditional security concerns have\r\nbecome increasingly prominent. Security is no longer a\r\npurely military concern. It has permeated politics,\r\neconomics, finance, science, technology, culture and\r\nmany other areas.\r\nSecurity is no longer a zero-sum game. Its\r\nmutuality is obviously on the increase, as countries\r\nhave come to realize that they have common security\r\ninterests and feel a greater sense of interdependence.\r\nWe must overhaul the tools at our disposal to\r\nachieve security. Military means alone have proved\r\ninadequate in meeting the massive and complex\r\nsecurity challenges facing us. The indiscriminate use of\r\nforce can only lead to greater trouble in our world.\r\nThis new situation calls for new ideas in the area\r\nof safeguarding security. We in China believe in a new\r\nsecurity concept that features mutual trust, mutual\r\nbenefit, equality and cooperation.\r\nBy mutual trust, we mean that countries should\r\nrise above their differing ideologies and social systems,\r\nabandon the cold-war mentality and the power politics\r\nmindset, and refrain from harbouring suspicion and\r\nhostility towards each other. They should hold frequent\r\ndialogues and mutual briefings on their security and\r\ndefence policies or on the major actions they are about\r\nto take.\r\nBy mutual benefit, we mean that a country should\r\nrespect the security interests of others while pursuing\r\nits own, and also help to create conditions for\r\nenhancing the security of others while making itself\r\nmore secure  thus achieving universal security.\r\nBy equality, we mean that all countries  large\r\nor small, strong or weak  should respect each other,\r\ntreat each other as equals and refrain from interfering\r\nin each others internal affairs, so that international\r\nrelations can become more democratized.\r\nBy cooperation, we mean that countries should\r\nresolve their disputes through peaceful negotiations,\r\nengage in extensive and close cooperation on their\r\nshared security concerns and work to prevent wars and\r\nconflicts.\r\nAll in all, our new security concept is aimed at\r\nincreasing mutual trust through dialogue and at\r\npromoting common security through cooperation.\r\nIt is in the spirit of this new security concept that\r\nwe in China have been working hard to promote\r\nmechanisms for a regional security dialogue and\r\ncooperation, actively participating in the Shanghai\r\nCooperation Organization and in the Association of\r\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum,\r\nand endeavouring to establish an Asia-Pacific security\r\nframework that is for dialogue and against\r\nconfrontation.\r\nChina is actively committed to international arms\r\ncontrol, disarmament and the non-proliferation process.\r\nNot long ago, the Chinese Government promulgated\r\nthe Regulations on Export Controls of Missiles and\r\nRelated Items and Technologies and its Control List.\r\nThe Chinese Government will make further\r\nimprovements on its export-management mechanisms\r\nfor biological and chemical dual-use items. We call on\r\nthe international community actively to undertake\r\ndialogue and cooperation in the spirit of this new\r\nsecurity concept, in a joint effort to tackle the major\r\nsecurity concerns of the day.\r\nWe should press ahead with international\r\ncooperation against terrorism and curb the threat of\r\ninternational terrorism once and for all.\r\nCounter-terrorism should be pursued on the basis\r\nof international law and of the norms governing\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\ninternational relations, allowing the United Nations and\r\nits Security Council to play a leading role. It should\r\ntake a comprehensive approach, with a focus on\r\neliminating the root causes of terrorism. Efforts should\r\nbe made to prevent the arbitrary enlargement of the\r\nscope of the counter-terrorism campaign, but proven\r\nterrorists, including the East Turkestan terrorist\r\nforces  trained, armed and bankrolled by the Taliban\r\nand Al Qaeda  must be resolutely stamped out.\r\nWe should step up dialogue and reconciliation\r\nprocesses and facilitate the settlement of regional hot-\r\nspot issues.\r\nChina supports the Palestinian people and their\r\njust cause to regain their legitimate national rights and\r\nto establish their own State. We support the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions and the principle of land\r\nfor peace. We are opposed to violence targeting\r\ninnocent civilians, and we reject responding to violence\r\nwith violence.\r\nWe stand for a political settlement of the question\r\nof Iraq. The United Nations should play an important\r\nrole in this regard. Iraq should implement the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions in a faithful and strict\r\nmanner.\r\nWe hope that India and Pakistan will soon resume\r\ndialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect\r\nand resolve all their differences, including that over\r\nKashmir, through peaceful means.\r\nWe will continue to work constructively for a\r\nlasting peace in Afghanistan and its post-war\r\nrehabilitation. We support the important role of the\r\nUnited Nations in this regard.\r\nWe should strengthen exchanges and dialogues\r\namong different civilizations and thereby avert conflict\r\nor confrontation. Differences among diverse\r\ncivilizations are a basic characteristic of humanity.\r\nWe have every reason to treat the achievements of\r\nvarious civilizations kindly and to promote exchanges\r\namong them on the basis of respect for diversity.\r\nEveryone is encouraged to draw upon the strength of\r\nothers with a view to realizing common development.\r\nPeace and development go hand in hand. Many of\r\nthe problems we face today may be development-\r\nrelated. In coping with these challenges, it is all the\r\nmore important to look to development for answers. In\r\nthe past year, the United Nations has held a series of\r\nimportant meetings on development such as the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development. What is needed,\r\nright now, is to translate the programmes and\r\ncommitments into reality.\r\nIn the past year, regional economic cooperation\r\nhas continued to move forward. We feel especially\r\nhappy about the launching of the African Union,\r\nconvinced that Africa will now take fresh strides on the\r\nroad to development. At present, our development\r\ntasks have become more pressing. The widening wealth\r\ngap in the world must be reversed. Frequent economic\r\nand social shocks must be dealt with. The sharpening\r\nclashes between economic development, on the one\r\nhand, and resources and the environment, on the other,\r\nmust be allayed. The international order and the rules\r\nof the game, which do not fairly reflect the needs of\r\ndeveloping countries, must be changed.\r\nWe would like to make the following\r\npropositions. First, to establish a global partnership\r\ngeared to development. Governments, international\r\norganizations, transnational corporations and non-\r\ngovernmental groups are all parties to the cause of\r\ndevelopment. The North and the South, the aid-\r\nrecipient countries and international aid institutions,\r\nshould be equal and cooperative partners in dealing\r\nwith the global economic slowdown. The developed\r\ncountries ought to lend developing countries a helping\r\nhand. The new round of multilateral trade talks should\r\nbe seized as an important opportunity for forging such\r\na new partnership.\r\nSecondly, to promote a balanced and steady\r\ndevelopment in the context of economic globalization.\r\nThe international community needs to reform current\r\nroles in the world economy, strengthen guidance and\r\nmanagement of the globalization process and promote\r\na win-win situation and coexistence among countries.\r\nThirdly, to strengthen the developing countries\r\ncapacity for self-development. Developing countries\r\nshould opt for a development path suited to them and\r\nstrive to catch up with the tide of global economic\r\ndevelopment. The international community should\r\nrespect the right of developing countries to\r\nindependently choose a development path, and help\r\nthem with capacity-building.\r\nFourthly, in order to continue on the path of\r\nsustainable development, we should promote a\r\nbalanced development of the economy, population,\r\nresources and the environment. Efforts to address the\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nenvironmental problems of individual countries should\r\nbe combined with those aimed at global concerns.\r\nFifthly, to enhance comprehensive development of the\r\npeople. Human resources are the primary resources for\r\nadvancing science and technology and for realizing\r\neconomic and social development. In formulating\r\ndevelopment strategies, countries should make the\r\npeople their top priority and main beneficiary.\r\nThe Communist Party of China will soon hold its\r\nsixteenth national Congress, the very first in the new\r\ncentury. Standing in the forefront of the historical tide\r\nand displaying a spirit of progressing with the times,\r\nthis party Congress will draw up a new blueprint for\r\naccelerating socialist modernization in China. Our\r\nguiding thought is to consistently represent the\r\ndevelopment requirements of Chinas advanced\r\nproductive forces, represent the orientation of Chinas\r\nadvanced culture and represent the fundamental\r\ninterests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese\r\npeople. Our historic mission is to accelerate the drive\r\nfor modernization, complete the reunification of the\r\nmotherland, maintain world peace and promote\r\ncommon development.\r\nThe first 10 to 20 years of this century present\r\nChina with an important strategic window of\r\nopportunity for its development. While taking\r\ndevelopment as our number one priority, we must grasp\r\nthe opportunities, deepen reform, open the country still\r\nwider to the outside world, promote development and\r\nmaintain stability.\r\nWe will continue to pursue an independent\r\nforeign policy of peace, actively develop friendly\r\nrelations in cooperation with all countries in the world\r\non the basis of the five principles of peaceful\r\ncoexistence, and facilitate international dialogue and\r\ncooperation, thus contributing constructively to a fairer\r\nand more equitable international order.\r\nThere is but one China in the world. Both the\r\nmainland and Taiwan belong to that one China, and\r\nChinas sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no\r\ndivision. The Chinese Government adheres to the basic\r\npolicy of peaceful reunification and one country, two\r\nsystems; and President Jiang Zemins eight point\r\nproposal on how to develop cross-strait relations and\r\npromote a peaceful reunification of the motherland for\r\nthe current stage. We are firm in our opposition to all\r\nforms of Taiwanese independence activities and will\r\ntolerate no attempt to separate Taiwan from the rest of\r\nChina in any fashion. All acts of Taiwan independence\r\nare doomed to failure and our grand cause of national\r\nreunification will triumph.\r\nThe President: I now call on the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Choi Sung-hong.\r\nMr. Choi Sung-hong (Republic of Korea): The\r\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 awakened the\r\ninternational community to the gravity of a new\r\nmenace to world peace and security. The lighting of the\r\neternal flame during the commemorative service in\r\nBattery Park was mirrored by the outpouring of\r\nsympathy from around the globe and the world became\r\none again, reaching out to those who lost their loved\r\nones on that fateful day.\r\nThe global community responded promptly and\r\ndecisively to the scourge of terrorism. Over the past\r\nyear, international cooperation has been strengthened\r\nin our relentless campaign against terrorism. The\r\nSecurity Council, in particular, has played a\r\ncommendable role in this process through its Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee. The Republic of Korea has been\r\nan active member of the international coalition against\r\nterrorism. We are now working with other countries to\r\ncontribute to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan.\r\nAs we conduct our resolute fight against\r\nterrorism, we should also consider that deprivation,\r\nlack of good governance and marginalization from the\r\nprocess of globalization can serve as a breeding ground\r\nfor fanatics who can go so far as to take their own lives\r\njust to harm others. The international community\r\nshould, therefore, take a holistic approach, while\r\nbearing in mind at all times that terrorism cannot be\r\njustified by any cause or under any circumstances\r\nwhatsoever.\r\nThe events of 11 September have also brought\r\nhome to the world the appalling dangers of weapons of\r\nmass destruction falling into the wrong hands.\r\nMoreover, the prevailing international reality\r\nunderscores the urgent need to make progress in\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nIt is essential that we achieve universality of non-\r\nproliferation regimes  including the Treaty on the\r\nNon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical\r\nWeapons Convention and the Biological Weapons\r\nConvention  while ensuring full compliance by all\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nStates parties to such regimes. We also hope that a total\r\nban on nuclear testing and fissile material production\r\nwill be achieved through the early entry into force of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and an\r\nexpeditious conclusion of a fissile material cut-off\r\ntreaty. In that regard, I would like to underline the\r\nRepublic of Koreas full commitment to strengthening\r\nmultilateral collaboration to promote the cause of\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nSince its inception, the United Nations has played\r\na key role in securing peace and stability in the\r\ntroubled corners of the world. Indeed, the work of the\r\nUnited Nations in conflict prevention, peacemaking,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building has expanded in\r\nrecent years.\r\nEast Timor is the latest success for which the\r\nUnited Nations deserves praise. As a Member State\r\ncommitted to the coalition of the willing, the Republic\r\nof Korea has actively taken part in the United Nations\r\nefforts in East Timor and other parts of the world.\r\nMoreover, our overall financial contribution to United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations has grown\r\napproximately tenfold over the past three years. The\r\nRepublic of Korea intends to strengthen its\r\ninvolvement in these crucial United Nations activities.\r\nThe Korean peninsula is still one of the worlds\r\nmost volatile areas. Nevertheless, President Kim Dae-\r\njungs unwavering pursuit of his engagement policy is\r\nfundamentally reshaping inter-Korean relations. That\r\nengagement policy is, in essence, a strategy for peace\r\nthrough engagement, designed to cope with the\r\nmultiple challenges inherent in inter-Korean relations\r\non the road to eventual unification. As such, it aims at\r\nfostering inter-Korean reconciliation, promoting\r\ncooperation and exchanges, reducing tension and\r\nbuilding durable peace on the peninsula.\r\nThe highlight of the engagement policy was the\r\nholding of the historic summit between South Korea\r\nand North Korea in June 2000. The summit set in\r\nmotion an inter-Korean peace process. After ups and\r\ndowns along the way, the peace process is finally back\r\non track and moving forward again. Inter-Korean\r\nmeetings at various levels have resumed, as have\r\nexchanges in all areas. In fact, on this very day, at\r\nMount Kumgang, the fifth round of reunions between\r\nseparated family members is taking place. Next week,\r\nSouth Korea and North Korea will hold the long-\r\nanticipated ground-breaking ceremonies marking the\r\nstart of construction work for the reconnecting of\r\nrailways and roads that have remained severed for five\r\ndecades. Since those projects literally involve a\r\nbreakthrough in the heavily fortified border and require\r\na certain level of military-to-military cooperation, they\r\nwill hold not only great practical benefit but also\r\ntremendous symbolic significance. As we look ahead to\r\nthe completion of the trans-Korean railway, this clearly\r\npromises to have far-reaching interregional\r\nimplications for accomplishing the vision of an iron\r\nsilk road, a rail link joining Asia and Europe.\r\nThe overall progress report to date amply\r\ndemonstrates that the engagement policy works. The\r\nKorean people on both sides of the peninsula today\r\nenjoy a stronger peace than ever, and the risk of war is\r\nat an all-time low since the end of the Korean War, in\r\n1950. However, it is not yet time to be complacent, as\r\nwe have still a long way to go if the peace process is to\r\nprove irreversible and fully sustainable.\r\nOne important challenge to the peace process\r\nrelates to the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We continue to believe that the 1994\r\nGeneva Agreed Framework holds the best hope for\r\nremoving concerns over nuclear proliferation from the\r\nKorean peninsula. However, at the moment, the Agreed\r\nFramework has reached a critical juncture. As the light\r\nwater reactor project progresses, it is now essential that\r\nfull cooperation with the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency begin without further delay for the\r\nimplementation of the safeguards requirements of the\r\nAgreed Framework.\r\nThe path to world peace runs through more\r\nequitable economic and social development. In that\r\nregard, we attach great importance to the United\r\nNations Agenda for Development and, in particular, to\r\nthe implementation of the United Nations Millennium\r\nDeclaration. The International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, held in Monterrey in\r\nMarch of this year, was a success in the area of\r\nenhancing shared awareness of the primary\r\nresponsibility of developing countries themselves, as\r\nwell as in emphasizing the need for more substantial\r\ninput from developed countries. The Political\r\nDeclaration and Plan of Implementation adopted at the\r\nrecent World Summit on Sustainable Development are\r\nalso of great significance, as they have set out a time-\r\nbound plan of action for humanitys quest to preserve\r\nthe planet for posterity. The unprecedented advances in\r\ninformation and communication technologies are also\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nwidening the gap between the front runners and those\r\nwho lag behind. We hope that the United Nations and\r\nother relevant international organizations will become\r\nmore proactive in bridging the digital divide between\r\ndeveloped and developing nations.\r\nThe last century witnessed the steady advance\r\nand triumph of democracy and human rights as\r\nuniversal values around the globe. As it has been so\r\neloquently put, liberty, when it begins to take root, is a\r\nplant of rapid growth indeed. The human rights\r\nsituation in any given country is no longer an\r\nexclusively domestic affair. The issue of human rights\r\nhas become a priority agenda item for the international\r\ncommunity. During the last session of the General\r\nAssembly, special attention was paid to the human\r\nrights of such vulnerable groups as children and the\r\nelderly. We sincerely hope that the pledges made at the\r\nSecond World Assembly on Ageing, as well as at the\r\nspecial session on children, will be translated into\r\nconcrete action.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has a firm commitment to\r\ninternational cooperation for the promotion of\r\ndemocracy and human rights. We plan to host the\r\nsecond Ministerial Conference of the Community of\r\nDemocracies in Seoul in November of this year. We are\r\nworking with other Convening Group countries to\r\nensure that this proves a momentous occasion in the\r\nprotection, consolidation and advancement of\r\ndemocracy the world over. We also welcome the\r\nrenewed commitment of the international community\r\nto combat such growing problems of horrific\r\ntransnational crime as the trafficking in persons.\r\nOver the past half century, the United Nations has\r\nmade outstanding contributions to causes of great\r\nimportance to humankind. However, the world body\r\ncannot possibly meet all expectations. Given the\r\nlimited means and resources available to it, the United\r\nNations should focus on areas in which it can excel,\r\nmaking the best use of its comprehensive mandate and\r\nthe universality of its membership. In that regard, the\r\nRepublic of Korea strongly supports the ongoing\r\nreforms that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been\r\npursuing with a view to achieving a more effective and\r\nefficient United Nations.\r\nIn closing, I would like to say that the United\r\nNations is the embodiment of globalism and the\r\nepitome of multilateral cooperation. As such, the\r\ninternational community looks to the United Nations\r\nfor guidance and effective action in the whole spectrum\r\nof areas under its mandate.\r\nThe Republic of Korea reaffirms its firm\r\ncommitment to working in concert with other Member\r\nStates to make the United Nations more relevant and\r\nefficient, and thus better able to meet the challenges\r\nahead  global challenges indeed.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Igor S. Ivanov, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Ivanov (Russian Federation) (spoke in\r\nRussian): One year has passed since the tragic events\r\nthat took place on 11 September 2001 in the United\r\nStates of America shook the world and demonstrated\r\nthe magnitude and brutality of the global threat of\r\ninternational terrorism. During the past year the world\r\nbecame fully aware of the challenges that humankind\r\nwas facing as we entered the twenty-first century. It\r\nwas a year during which the international community\r\ncame together and began to take decisive action against\r\nterrorism.\r\nWhile paying tribute to the memory of all of the\r\nvictims of the terrorism that has left a bloody trail\r\nthroughout the world, we must now take stock of the\r\ninitial results of the joint anti-terrorist campaign and,\r\nmost important, outline our objectives in strengthening\r\nthe foundations of international security and stability.\r\nThe most important outcome of the coming\r\ntogether of States to achieve common goals \r\nunprecedented since the Second World War  is clear\r\ntoday. A broad international anti-terrorist coalition has\r\nbeen established and is actively functioning; it has\r\nalready demonstrated its effectiveness in Afghanistan,\r\na country that international terrorists of various\r\naffiliations had transformed into their own personal\r\nlair. Our common objective is not only to preserve the\r\nexperience of interaction acquired within the\r\nframework of the coalition  avoiding such unilateral\r\nactions as might undermine it  but also to transform\r\nthe anti-terrorist alliance into a supportive mechanism\r\nof effective security and cooperation for the new\r\nmillennium.\r\nThe United Nations must certainly be a pivotal\r\nelement of such a mechanism. Indeed, the United\r\nNations is called upon to continue to guarantee that, in\r\ncombating new threats and challenges, the efforts of\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nthe international community rest on a solid basis of\r\ninternational law.\r\nWe must acknowledge  and the past year has\r\nbeen very instructive in this regard  that a great deal\r\nof hard work awaits us. It will be possible to put\r\ninsurmountable obstacles in the way of fanatics and\r\nextremists who spread death and destruction only if we\r\ncan reach general agreement on core issues relating to\r\nthe world order. In this context, the role of the United\r\nNations is, indeed, irreplaceable.\r\nThe fact that the process of implementing the\r\nfundamental anti-terrorist resolution  Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  is under way is of\r\ncritical importance. That resolution is binding on all\r\nStates, and we must now seek to achieve its\r\nunconditional implementation by all States.\r\nA priority task in the war on terrorism is the\r\nstrengthening of its international legal framework. First\r\nand foremost, there is a need to ensure the genuinely\r\nuniversal character of existing anti-terrorist\r\nconventions.\r\nHaving ratified the 1999 Convention for the\r\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, Russia is\r\nnow completing the process of accession to those\r\ninternational instruments. At the same time, we are\r\nseriously concerned about the lack of real progress in\r\nnegotiating a comprehensive convention on combating\r\nterrorism and a convention on the suppression of acts\r\nof nuclear terrorism.\r\nThe well-known differences in the approaches of\r\nStates to the provisions of such instruments could\r\ncertainly be fully reconciled. They should not\r\novershadow the objective, which is pressing for all of\r\nus, of establishing a legal basis to counter terrorism in\r\nall its manifestations  a basis that would be in\r\nkeeping with the realities of todays world. Russia is\r\ncontinuing to make resolute efforts to achieve that\r\nobjective.\r\nIt is the obligation of all States to protect the\r\nrights and freedoms of their citizens, the most\r\nimportant of these being the right to life. But it is\r\nprecisely the lives of ordinary people that are\r\nthreatened by terrorists, and each year new names are\r\nadded to the list of victims. The international\r\ncommunity can no longer tolerate this. It is our\r\nobligation to provide our citizens with the right to\r\nreliable protection against terrorism.\r\nSuch an objective can be achieved only if all\r\nStates agree on a range of specific measures under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. There is now a need to draw\r\nup an effective code to protect human rights against\r\nterrorism. Some of these measures have already been\r\ndiscussed by the international community, including in\r\nthis forum. Others will require consideration in a\r\nbroader context. The most important consideration,\r\nhowever, is that we should agree on a unified system of\r\nvalues and measures shared by all States.\r\nThe results of the war against terrorism will be\r\ntangible only if we act in concert at all levels  global,\r\nregional and national. The anti-terrorist cooperation\r\nmechanisms aimed at preventing the spread of\r\nterrorism in Central Asia, including those within the\r\nframework of the Commonwealth of Independent\r\nStates and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, are\r\ngaining momentum and thus provide clear evidence of\r\nthat fact. There is a great deal of potential in the new\r\npartnership between Russia and the countries of the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.\r\nThe field of anti-terrorism is an integral part of\r\nour continuous dialogue and cooperation with the\r\nleading countries of the world, including the United\r\nStates, China, India and the States members of the\r\nEuropean Union. We are confident that the\r\ndevelopment of such interaction at many levels will\r\npromote a climate of confidence, security and\r\ncooperation in all parts of the world.\r\nThe stability and credibility of the emerging\r\ninternational system of the twenty-first century will\r\ndepend directly on the maintenance and strengthening\r\nof strategic stability. This fundamental objective was\r\nadvanced by the signing, by the Presidents of Russia\r\nand of the United States, at their May meeting in\r\nMoscow, of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty,\r\nwhich was a specific, major contribution by the leading\r\nnuclear Powers to nuclear disarmament.\r\nIt is also very important to ensure the non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The\r\ndanger of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons or\r\ntheir components falling into the irresponsible hands of\r\nterrorists increases international terrorisms potential to\r\ncause devastation. This means that there is a need to\r\nstep up efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation\r\nregime for weapons of mass destruction and their\r\ndelivery vehicles.\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nBy acting jointly and responsibly, we have\r\nalready achieved a great deal. When we speak about\r\nthe establishment of new regimes for the non-\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for\r\narms control, we by no means wish to imply a\r\nrenunciation of regimes and agreements already in\r\neffect. They are our shared protective mechanism  a\r\nmechanism that is very reliable and has stood the test\r\nof time. Unjustified removal of the key elements of the\r\ninternational legal framework of non-proliferation can\r\naggravate the international military and strategic\r\nsituation and undermine global security.\r\nFurthermore, we should universalize the most\r\nimportant agreements on non-proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons and on comprehensive nuclear test ban. The\r\nmissile sphere needs a sustainable negotiating process\r\naimed at concluding an international arrangement on a\r\nglobal regime of missile and missile technology non-\r\nproliferation.\r\nThe prevention of the deployment of weapons in\r\nouter space forms an integral part of the non-\r\nproliferation process. Together with a number of our\r\npartners we suggest that a comprehensive agreement be\r\nworked out aimed at preserving outer space as a zone\r\nfree from any kind of weapons. We are confident that\r\nthis proposal serves the interests of all States, and\r\nexpect that it will enjoy wide support.\r\nSince its establishment, the United Nations has\r\nbeen engaged in the settlement of regional conflicts.\r\nThose so-called local problems have long turned into\r\none of the main threats to international stability.\r\nTerrorism, political extremism, and economic and\r\nsocial degradation are their customary companions.\r\nCertainly, the primary responsibility in any settlement\r\nrests with the relevant parties, but multilateral\r\nmechanisms have also repeatedly demonstrated their\r\neffectiveness in the restoration of peace and concord. A\r\ntangible progress made with the United Nations visible\r\ninvolvement in the post-Taliban reconstruction of\r\nAfghanistan is one of our common accomplishments.\r\nWe can add to this the adoption by the United Nations\r\nSecurity Council of major practical decisions in\r\nsupport of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle\r\nEast and the resolution of crises in a number of African\r\ncountries.\r\nAnd yet, we are still far from a radical decrease in\r\nthe number and intensity of armed conflicts. Hard\r\nwork, requiring great human as well as material and\r\nfinancial resources, is awaiting us. But the most\r\nimportant here is the presence of a strong political will\r\nto implement the provisions of the United Nations\r\nCharter pertaining to the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\nExperience shows that no matter how complex\r\ninternational crises and conflicts may be, whatever\r\nchallenges and threats they may be fraught with, they\r\ncan be settled with the aid of United Nations\r\ninstruments and on the basis of international law. This\r\nfully applies to the situation around Iraq, which has\r\nlong required political settlement in strict compliance\r\nwith the Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe entire international community benefits from\r\na steady enhancement of the leading role of our\r\nOrganization in peacemaking. We cannot relax our\r\nattention to this task.\r\nAt all times and throughout the world, terrorism\r\nand extremism have tried to justify themselves with\r\ncontinuous social and economic instability and poverty.\r\nWhile recognizing the existence of these serious\r\nproblems we should state most resolutely that terrorism\r\ndoes not and will not have any justification. At the\r\nsame time, the creation of a sustainable and fair global\r\nfinancial and economic structure would, certainly, help\r\ncombat many dangerous challenges to mankind. The\r\nlatest major international forums  the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development\r\nin Monterey, World Food Summit in Rome,\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in\r\nJohannesburg  adopted decisions designed to uproot\r\nthe causes of the most threatening disparities in the\r\nworld. The next step is to implement the agreements\r\nwe have reached.\r\nEqually sweeping are the tasks that face us in the\r\nfield of environmental protection. Natural disasters that\r\nafflicted many regions of our planet this summer have\r\ndemonstrated again that the solution of environmental\r\nissues cannot be put off unless we want to endanger the\r\nvery survival of future generations. This sphere also\r\ndepends on multilateral efforts that exclude the egoism\r\nof individual States.\r\nThe initiative of Russian President Vladimir V.\r\nPutin on holding in autumn 2003 a World Conference\r\non Climate Change in Moscow is designed to\r\ncoordinate our efforts in this field.\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nA year ago, the Russian Federation called on the\r\ninternational community from the podium of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly to create a global\r\nsystem of counteraction to present-day threats and\r\nchallenges that would be aimed at tackling real issues\r\nin the sphere of security and at meeting the vital\r\ninterests of each and every State. This system would\r\nprovide for long-term international stability and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nTo be efficient, such a system needs a generally\r\nrecognized coordinating centre capable of rallying the\r\ninternational community. And we do have such a\r\ncentre  the United Nations with its unique\r\nlegitimacy, universality and experience. Our common\r\ntask is to unite around the United Nations to provide it\r\nwith the necessary potential and resources and to\r\ndevelop as much as possible its internal reserves.\r\nToday, we can state with satisfaction that the\r\nglobal system is already evolving and the beginning of\r\nthis process is largely successful. We suggest that an\r\nadditional impetus should be given to this process and\r\na resolution to encourage a most prompt creation of a\r\nglobal system of counteraction to present-day threats\r\nand challenges should be adopted at this session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. By doing so, we will direct all\r\nStates towards the joint elaboration of its general shape\r\nand parameters. This is even more relevant because\r\nsome of its parameters are already visible.\r\nIt is apparent that the system to be created must\r\nbe:\r\n Global, as modern challenges in the context of\r\nglobalization pose a universal threat, and should\r\nbe addressed at the global level.\r\n Comprehensive in scope, as each of the modern\r\nthreats bears a huge destructive potential and all\r\nsuch problems without exceptions should be\r\nembraced by the system.\r\n Holistic in approach, as quite often the new\r\nthreats and challenges are directly interrelated.\r\n Universal in participation.\r\nFinally, the system should become a reflection of\r\nthe international rule of law, as its power will be built\r\non principles and regulations of international law, the\r\nUnited Nations Charter above all.\r\nWe bear grave responsibility to future\r\ngenerations, and the model of world order we will\r\nestablish is destined to influence the life on our planet\r\nfor decades. As for Russia, we have made our choice.\r\nThis is the choice in favour of a democratic, multi-\r\npolar world order, which would guarantee sustainable\r\ndevelopment and equal security for all States; a world\r\norder formed on the basis of the extensive structure of\r\nmultilateral institutions integrated within the\r\nframework of the United Nations.\r\nWe hope that the decisions of this General\r\nAssembly session will mark an important stage of this\r\nprocess.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Jorge Castañeda Gutman, the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Mexico.\r\nMr. Castañeda (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nMexico wishes to welcome two new Member States.\r\nTheir presence buttresses the universal mission of the\r\nUnited Nations. Our congratulations to the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste. This represents a further\r\nexpression of the right to self-determination and a\r\nreflection of its peoples resolve for independence.\r\nAlso, we welcome the decision of the people of the\r\nSwiss Confederation to become a full Member of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe international community is facing a defining\r\nmoment. A year after the attack on the United States, in\r\nwhich men and women from more than 80 different\r\ncountries perished, we have the responsibility to decide\r\ntogether the direction the international system should\r\ntake in the coming years.\r\nMexico is aware of the magnitude of the\r\nchallenges that the Organization faces today: the\r\nurgency of returning a human focus to globalization, of\r\nfighting the poverty that divides the world, of making\r\npossible development that respects the environment, of\r\nfinding formulas for resolving the many conflicts and\r\nwars that now affect millions of people, of effectively\r\nfighting international terrorism and of guaranteeing\r\nrespect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of\r\nevery human being.\r\nResponding to those challenges in a responsible\r\nand visionary way is more important today than ever\r\nbefore. At the present time, anger or the inevitable\r\ndifficulties of consensus-building may cloud judgement\r\nor give rise to pressure to act precipitously or\r\nunilaterally. Mexico is convinced that, at this time, the\r\nonly legitimate path of action is that based on a\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nmultilateral approach that favours agreement and\r\ncollective action, for the benefit of the international\r\ncommunity as a whole as well as of each our nations\r\nindividually. Therefore, Mexico reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the system of international security that\r\ngives the Security Council the responsibility of\r\nmaintaining world peace. In fulfilling that mandate, the\r\nCouncil must base its actions on the principles\r\narticulated in the Charter of the United Nations, such as\r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, which has been a\r\nfundamental aspiration of the community of nations\r\nsince the middle of the last century and is one of my\r\ncountrys most cherished ideals.\r\nMexico maintains that the Security Council is the\r\nproper body to adopt the measures necessary to achieve\r\na lasting solution to the question of Iraq. Therefore, we\r\nvalue the statement made yesterday by President\r\nGeorge Bush, which included a recognition of the\r\nimportance that debate and collective decision-making\r\nwill have in the coming days and weeks in determining\r\nthe path to be taken concerning Iraq. However, we\r\ncannot fail to recognize that the scope of action open to\r\nus will also involve complex challenges for Council\r\nmembers and for the entire international community.\r\nWe unequivocally condemn  as have most other\r\nnations  Iraqs continued non-compliance with\r\nCouncil resolutions concerning disarmament and the\r\nrenunciation of weapons of mass destruction, and we\r\nreaffirm the importance of that nations immediate\r\ncompliance  without preconditions  with Council\r\nresolutions concerning the return of United Nations\r\ninspectors. Nevertheless, we must recognize that non-\r\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions has\r\noccurred at other junctures, at other times and in other\r\nplaces.\r\nToday, we believe it is indispensable that the\r\nSecurity Council have the necessary time and support\r\nto seek the return of the inspectors, and we therefore\r\nsupport President Jacques Chiracs recent proposal to\r\nset a specific time frame for meeting that objective.\r\nMoreover, as a responsible and committed Council\r\nmember, Mexico believes that any decision arising\r\nfrom possible Iraqi non-compliance with the relevant\r\nresolutions should be taken based on two indispensable\r\nconditions. First, there must be a clearer evaluation of\r\nIraqs true weapons capacity  including both\r\ntechnology and delivery systems  and of its intention\r\nto use them or the capacity of terrorist groups to gain\r\naccess to them. It could be based on reports issued by\r\nUnited Nations inspection mechanisms, with additional\r\ninformation from individual countries. Secondly, there\r\nmust be agreement among Council member, as well as\r\nother countries directly involved, on the steps that must\r\nbe taken in the light of the corroboration of those facts\r\nor in the event of Iraqs refusal to permit the return of\r\ninspectors to its territory.\r\nMexico believes that unilateral military action,\r\ntaken without prior consultation with the Security\r\nCouncil, would undermine the foundations of the new\r\narchitecture of international security and could affect\r\nthe consensus in favour of the battle against\r\ninternational terrorism that followed the attacks\r\nperpetrated a year ago against the United States.\r\nMexico comes before the Assembly with the\r\ndetermination to assume an active role in building a\r\nnew world order. Its willingness for dialogue with\r\nother nations is a reflection of the democratic change\r\nthat has occurred in my country, which has also given\r\nMexico new confidence in its ability to contribute to\r\nattaining the objectives of the international community.\r\nThe determination to play a more active role in the\r\nworld has led us to incorporate issues and perspectives\r\nwith global dimensions and impact as key elements of\r\nour national interests. Fostering world economic\r\ndevelopment, promoting and defending human rights\r\nand strengthening democracy and sustainable\r\ndevelopment are examples of our commitment, which\r\ntranscends borders and sovereignties. The efforts that\r\nwe undertake to make global ideals reality will also\r\nenable us to promote more vigorously our national\r\nvalues.\r\nMexicos redoubled international activity has\r\nbeen reflected over the past months in a series of\r\nactions that mark a milestone in the history of our\r\nforeign relations. One of our projects with greatest\r\nstrategic vision is the Puebla-Panama Plan, whose\r\nobjective is to coordinate the efforts of the public,\r\nsocial and private sectors of Mexico and of the Central\r\nAmerican countries in implementing joint development\r\nand investment projects.\r\nWith the same determination, we are promoting a\r\nsense of community in North America in order to\r\narticulate shared values towards a common vision of\r\nregional development that is coherent, wide-ranging\r\nand long-term. In that context, we believe that the\r\ngradual negotiation of an immigration agreement to\r\nbring order and legality to the movement of labour in\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nthe region is an urgent priority. From Mexicos\r\nstandpoint, labour flows between countries must be\r\nviewed as an opportunity to redirect the globalization\r\nprocess and to reduce the gap that separates developed\r\nnations from less-developed societies.\r\nMy country has also launched an extensive\r\ncampaign of cultural promotion abroad. In that way,\r\nMexico is seeking to present to the world the wealth,\r\ndiversity and vitality of its culture in order to build\r\nbridges with other nations and regions. The\r\nstrengthening of cooperation and cultural ties among\r\nour countries must be a priority for us all. That is why\r\nwe welcome the return of the United States to the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe international activism displayed by Mexico\r\nfor almost two years now has been particularly evident\r\nin more intense work within multilateral forums. In\r\ncarrying out that work, we have often been able to\r\nbuild on the foundations established by previous\r\nAdministrations. But there is undoubtedly a new spirit\r\nand a new purpose in the role that multilateral activism\r\nplays in Mexicos international strategy.\r\nOur most important task in the multilateral sphere\r\nlies here within the United Nations. The Government\r\nof Mexico is proud to have received the support of the\r\ncommunity of nations for our countrys election as a\r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council. In that\r\nand other forums, we are actively participating in the\r\nbuilding of a new international architecture that will\r\ngovern relations among nations in the coming decades.\r\nMexicos participation in the Asia-Pacific\r\nEconomic Cooperation forum  in which we have\r\nparticipated since 1993  is another eloquent example\r\nof our international activism. In October, our country\r\nwill host the tenth meeting of the leaders of that\r\nmechanism, where we shall continue to promote\r\nactions that foster greater prosperity for the peoples of\r\nthe Asia-Pacific region.\r\nMexico has also vigorously promoted the\r\nrelaunching of international economic negotiations.\r\nThe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment, held in March at Monterrey, promoted a\r\nbroad and inclusive alliance among States and\r\ninternational organizations that should make possible a\r\nhigher level of financing for development, with a clear\r\nbalance between national responsibilities and\r\ninternational cooperation. Today, the Monterrey\r\nConsensus is the basis for redirecting globalization\r\ntowards growth and anti-poverty objectives, and it is\r\nthe ideal tool for placing development priorities at the\r\ncentre of the international agenda.\r\nFrom Mexicos standpoint, the Monterrey\r\nConference forms part of a coherent series of\r\ninternational summits devoted to promoting the agenda\r\nof world development. That process began last year in\r\nDoha with the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO); it grew in strength by\r\nincorporating the environmental dimension of\r\nsustainable development in Johannesburg, and it will\r\ncontinue with the holding of the Fifth Ministerial\r\nMeeting of the WTO in Cancún, Mexico, next year.\r\nThe close interrelationship among all the issues related\r\nto development was also apparent at the recent\r\nJohannesburg Summit, where the positions that\r\nPresident Vicente Fox put forward on behalf of Mexico\r\nwere widely supported and recognized.\r\nMindful of the new threats to international\r\nsecurity, the Mexican Government has also called for\r\nthe security arrangements of the Americas to be\r\nupdated. We have offered to host a special conference\r\non security to be convened at the third Summit of the\r\nAmericas, to take place in Mexico in May 2003.\r\nNotwithstanding the importance of all these\r\nactions, Mexicos new role at the international level is\r\nparticularly evident in our promotion of human rights\r\nand democracy. My country has stated its conviction\r\nthat human rights represent absolute and universal\r\nvalues and that, as such, the obligation to uphold them\r\nis a duty shared by all Governments and peoples,\r\nirrespective of borders and sovereignties. Moreover, we\r\nhave been consistent in these convictions. That is why,\r\ndespite the mixed reaction that it has generated in\r\nMexico, given the strong bonds of friendship that\r\nMexican society has always enjoyed with several\r\nnations close to us, we have been compelled to express\r\nour concern about the human rights situation in those\r\ncountries. One of the most far-reaching steps we have\r\ntaken to demonstrate our commitment to the cause of\r\nhuman rights is the harmonization of Mexican\r\nlegislation with international instruments that protect\r\nsuch rights. We have placed particular emphasis on the\r\nprotection of such vulnerable groups as women,\r\nchildren, indigenous peoples and the disabled.\r\nAt the same time, we have abandoned the\r\ndefensive attitude that prevented us from entering into\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\ndialogue with other nations and multilateral\r\norganizations dedicated to the protection of human\r\nrights. Upon the invitation of the Mexican\r\nGovernment, many representatives of international\r\nhuman rights organizations have visited our country. In\r\nthe same spirit of openness, the Mexican Government\r\nsigned a framework agreement with the Office of the\r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nIn the context of efforts of the Mexican\r\nGovernment to strengthen the rule of law, the Mexican\r\nSenate is currently considering a draft constitutional\r\namendment that would allow our country to ratify the\r\nRome Statute creating the International Criminal Court.\r\nThis amendment would involve recognition of the\r\njurisdiction of international courts created by treaties to\r\nwhich Mexico is party and ensure compliance with\r\ntheir resolutions and rulings. The amendment\r\nrepresents a decisive step towards incorporating and\r\nensuring the effectiveness of the standards of\r\ninternational law at the domestic level. Mexico\r\nwelcomes the recent entry into force of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, which reflects the resolve\r\nof the community of nations to create an international\r\nsystem based on universal standards.\r\nWe believe, however, that the signing of\r\nagreements by those seeking to prevent a given\r\ncategory of persons from being subject to the\r\njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court\r\nrepresents a grave step backwards for international law.\r\nIt threatens the universal scope of the provisions of the\r\nRome Statute, distorts the spirit that led to its creation\r\nand undermines the efforts of the community of States\r\nto eliminate impunity in the cases of extremely serious\r\ncrimes. We appeal to the members of the international\r\ncommunity to assist in strengthening the authority of\r\nthe International Criminal Court, which it has spent so\r\nmuch time and effort to build.\r\nThe defence of human rights necessarily involves\r\nthe promotion of democratic freedoms. Today, we are\r\nseeing increasingly widespread recognition of the fact\r\nthat representative democracy, with its institutional\r\nframework of parties, groups and civil society\r\norganizations, as well as the legal framework\r\nsafeguarding the civil freedoms of association and\r\nspeech, constitutes the best way of reconciling the\r\nlegitimate exercise of authority with respect to those\r\nfreedoms that are essential to human beings. Mexicos\r\nactive part in drafting the Inter-American Democratic\r\nCharter, which was signed by the nations of the\r\nAmerican continent in September 2001, is another\r\nexample of my countrys commitment to democratic\r\nprinciples. At the same, we are successfully promoting\r\ndemocratic values in other regions, as demonstrated by\r\nour work within the Community of Democracies,\r\nwhose second conference is scheduled to be held in\r\nNovember.\r\nThe adherence of the Mexican Government and\r\nMexican society to human rights and democracy has\r\ntwo mutually complementary aspects. On the one hand,\r\nit means strengthening democratic practices and\r\ninstitutions and human rights throughout the country, to\r\nwhich end we are restoring the effectiveness of the rule\r\nof law; on the other, it compels us to engage in more\r\nvigorous activism in international forums so that we\r\nmay encourage full respect for human rights and\r\ndemocracy throughout the world. This will enable us\r\nmore firmly to consolidate human rights and\r\ndemocracy in Mexico, so that the democratic change\r\nthat we have experienced can become irreversible.\r\nI am here today to state that my country has\r\nreturned with renewed energy to the international\r\nscene. The Mexican Government has moved from\r\ndefensive aloofness to constructive dialogue, and from\r\nlimited international legitimacy to the exercise of\r\ndiplomacy based on democratic principles and\r\nunqualified respect for human rights. The kind of world\r\nwe wish to create and the steps we are willing to\r\ntake  or to refrain from taking  in order to achieve\r\nit are questions that we cannot evade at this critical\r\nmoment of international redefinition. Mexico reaffirms\r\nits conviction that action based on principles and\r\nagreements must take precedence over the temptations\r\nof unilateralism and that universal standards must\r\nprevail over short-term interests. Mexicos\r\ninternational activism, in particular its commitment to\r\nhuman rights and democracy, reflects the belief of the\r\nMexican nation in the essential equality of all human\r\nbeings and in the duties that it entails for all our\r\npeoples and Governments.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Şükrü Sina Gürel, Deputy Prime\r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey.\r\nMr. Gürel (Turkey): At the outset, I wish to join\r\nother speakers in warmly congratulating you, Sir, on\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-seventh session. My delegation offers you its\r\nfull support to the presidencys work. I also wish to pay\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\ntribute to your predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his\r\nable guidance of the last session.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to salute here\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and the two new\r\nMembers of the United Nations, the Swiss\r\nConfederation and the Democratic Republic of East\r\nTimor.\r\nTurkey is firmly convinced that, throughout this\r\nnew century, the need for the United Nations will\r\nincreasingly grow. It is the only multilateral\r\nOrganization with universal membership dedicated to\r\nthe noble aims of maintaining peace and international\r\nsecurity, addressing global issues and establishing\r\nstandards that should apply to all.\r\nExactly a year ago, evil in its worst form struck\r\nNew York and Washington, D.C. Since the tragedy of\r\n11 September, it has become amply clear that terrorist\r\norganizations have much broader international\r\nnetworks than anticipated. Terrorism has many names\r\nand faces and recognizes no boundaries. This is a\r\nphenomenon that is not confined to and cannot be\r\nidentified with any particular geography, religion, race\r\nor culture. Terrorism is the most blatant violation of\r\nhuman rights. Nothing can ever justify terrorism and\r\nthere can be no leniency towards it.\r\nTurkey has been calling for years for intensified\r\ninternational cooperation against terrorism. We have\r\nbeen actively engaged in the work of the United\r\nNations to fight this scourge and we commend the\r\nongoing efforts. Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001), in particular, provides a clear road map with\r\nregard to the steps that need to be taken to combat\r\nterrorism more effectively.\r\nIt is incumbent upon all Member States to adopt\r\nexisting international legislation and to review their\r\nrelevant national laws accordingly. We urge those\r\nStates that have not yet done so to become parties to\r\nthe 12 international conventions on specific terrorist\r\noffences. We also look forward to the completion of the\r\nwork on a comprehensive convention against\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nPreventive diplomacy and peacekeeping have\r\ngained even more priority in this era of new conflicts.\r\nTurkey has been actively participating in the efforts of\r\nthe United Nations in conflict prevention and plays a\r\nsignificant role within peace missions mandated by the\r\nUnited Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\r\nEurope (OSCE). Hence, we commend the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to ensure prompt reaction to\r\nemerging crises and welcome the manifold\r\nconsiderations contained in his report (A/55/985) on\r\nthe prevention of armed conflicts.\r\nMy country took over the command of the\r\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in\r\nKabul at an extremely critical juncture. We take pride\r\nin fulfilling that task and thank the other contributing\r\nnations. Indeed, all ISAF personnel are serving with a\r\nstrong sense of purpose and mission. Traditionally a\r\nclose friend of the Afghans, Turkey has contributed for\r\nmany years to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. We\r\nsalute the performance of the Transitional Authority\r\nunder the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Hamid\r\nKarzai, the Afghan President.\r\nToday we must rapidly embark upon real and\r\ntangible development efforts in Afghanistan. It is with\r\nthis understanding that Turkey provides the Afghan\r\npeople with assistance that is directed at developing\r\ntheir national potential. Likewise, efforts to build the\r\nAfghan national army and the police force as well as\r\nsolidarity and unity among the ethnic groups are of\r\ncrucial importance.\r\nWe feel strongly that the international community\r\nshould fulfil its commitments adopted at the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on Reconstruction Assistance\r\nto Afghanistan. support His Excellency Mr. Lakhdar\r\nBrahimi, the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Afghanistan, in his efforts to secure greater\r\nfinancial assistance. The United Nations is to be\r\ncommended for successfully spearheading\r\nreconstruction activity.\r\nTurkey is located in close proximity to many of\r\nthe existing conflict spots and potential new threats\r\nthat are high on the United Nations agenda.\r\nAccordingly, we are closely interested in promoting\r\npeace, stability and prosperity in our part of the world,\r\nparticularly in the Balkans, the Middle East and the\r\nCaucasus.\r\nWe have been witnessing positive changes in the\r\npolitical and security environment of the Balkans. The\r\nmulti-ethnic, multi-religious and multicultural fabric of\r\nthe Balkan countries must be preserved. We believe\r\nnow is the right time for the word Balkans to be\r\nfreed from its negative connotation and be made to\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nstand for such positive concepts as ethnic harmony,\r\nmutual respect and peaceful cohabitation.\r\nWe hope that the elections in the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\r\nthose to be held in a few weeks time in Kosovo, will\r\nbe instrumental in shaping a better future for the\r\nBalkans.\r\nOur resolve to further improve our relations with\r\nGreece through the current process of constructive\r\ndialogue remains intact. We seek to encourage and\r\nfoster the spirit of friendship and cooperation so that\r\nwe can make further progress. In that respect, the two\r\ncountries signed a number of bilateral documents. As\r\nfor the Aegean Sea, we believe that Turkish-Greek\r\nrelations have indeed reached a level of maturity that\r\ncould enable us to address the issues at hand on a\r\nbilateral basis. To that end, we have been discussing\r\ncertain confidence-building measures and have agreed\r\non some. We are also encouraged by the ongoing\r\nexploratory contacts.\r\nRegarding Cyprus, we continue to support the\r\nefforts aimed at finding a just, viable, lasting and\r\ncomplete settlement. Cyprus is an issue between the\r\ntwo equal, distinct peoples on the island, namely the\r\nTurkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, each of\r\nwhich lives under its own political and democratic\r\nstructures. The two peoples of Cyprus should be able to\r\ncoexist and share power under a new partnership State\r\nstructure on the basis of the equal status and sovereign\r\nequality of the two partner States. We will continue to\r\nsupport the current direct talks between the two leaders\r\nin Cyprus, which enable the two parties to search for\r\ncomprehensive reconciliation without any third-party\r\ninvolvement. We believe that equal treatment of both\r\nsides will foster an environment that will encourage\r\nthem to move towards a new partnership of equals,\r\nexcluding the possibility of reverting to the situation\r\nthat existed before 1974. We support the recent Turkish\r\nCypriot proposals, which provide a sound and realistic\r\nbasis for a settlement. We believe that the international\r\ncommunity should give due consideration to these\r\nproposals, which open a new window of opportunity\r\nfor the resolution of this longstanding issue.\r\nThe decision of the European Union Council to\r\nstart accession negotiations with the Greek Cypriot\r\nadministration, despite the illegitimacy of its claim to\r\nrepresent the whole island, has made an agreed\r\nsettlement even more elusive. Unfortunately, the Greek\r\nCypriot focus so far has been totally diverted to\r\nEuropean Union membership. Membership prior to\r\nsettlement would create many problems and would lead\r\nto tensions on the island and in the eastern\r\nMediterranean in general. We have reiterated that a\r\nunilateral Greek Cypriot entry into the European Union\r\nwould harm the chances for a mutually agreed\r\nsettlement establishing a new partnership between the\r\ntwo parties. The European Union must tell the Greek\r\nCypriots that they will not be admitted before a final\r\nsettlement. That is essential if we are to make\r\nmeaningful progress towards resolving the Cyprus\r\nissue.\r\nIn the aftermath of 11 September, peace and\r\nstability in the Middle East have gained even more\r\nimportance and urgency. Yet the present outlook of the\r\nongoing conflict does not leave much room for\r\noptimism. Violence persists, taking a huge toll on both\r\nsides. This year has been marked by successive\r\nterrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and the\r\ndisproportionate use of force by Israel against the\r\nPalestinians. The occupation of Palestinian towns and\r\nthe destruction of Palestinian infrastructure have only\r\nexacerbated the already difficult living conditions of\r\nthe Palestinian people.\r\nThe parameters of peace in the Middle East are\r\nembedded in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\r\nand 338 (1973). Those resolutions have now been\r\ngiven fuller meaning with the adoption of Council\r\nresolution 1397 (2001), laying out the vision of two\r\nStates living side by side within secure boundaries.\r\nThe international community is also encouraged\r\nby the Arab League plan adopted at its Beirut Summit,\r\nbased on a vision of the coexistence of all States in the\r\nregion through the full implementation of the relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions. Likewise, the 24 June\r\nstatement of the United States President charts the\r\ncontours of a process that will lead to the two-State\r\nobjective.\r\nMr. Aguilar Zinser (Mexico), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe international community should engage itself\r\nin encouraging and persuading all parties to the Middle\r\nEast conflict on the road to lasting peace. The\r\ninitiatives of the quartet are welcome, and Turkey, as\r\na regional facilitator, is ready to offer its assistance in\r\nwhatever way may be necessary. We need a\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nrelaunching of the peace process, and Turkey stands\r\nready to host a meeting to that end.\r\nMore than a decade after the liberation of Kuwait,\r\nthe Iraqi problem remains unresolved. The\r\nrepercussions of the Gulf war still prevail. The adverse\r\neffects of that situation on the people of Iraq, on\r\nTurkey and on the region as a whole are increasing.\r\nThe only way out for Iraq is to cooperate fully with the\r\nUnited Nations by implementing the relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. Turkey has been encouraging Iraq\r\nin that direction. We would like to see an Iraq whose\r\nterritorial integrity and political unity are preserved\r\nand which is peacefully reintegrated into the\r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Caucasus is another area of close interest for\r\nTurkey. We aim to help in establishing comprehensive\r\ncooperation in the region. However, the unresolved\r\nconflicts in Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia still stand\r\nas principal obstacles to political stability and\r\neconomic development. The Security Council has\r\nadopted four resolutions urging the immediate\r\nwithdrawal of all troops from the Azerbaijani\r\nterritories, with which Armenia has not complied.\r\nBeing an active member of the Minsk Group,\r\nTurkey is working for a peaceful resolution of the\r\nNagorny-Karabakh conflict within the framework of\r\nthe OSCE. We initiated a tripartite meeting among the\r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Azerbaijan\r\nand Turkey in May.\r\nThe Abkhazian conflict still endangers peace and\r\nstability in Georgia and in the entire region. From the\r\noutset, Turkey has supported the peaceful resolution of\r\nthe conflict within the framework of the sovereignty,\r\nindependence and territorial integrity of Georgia.\r\nIn addition to the challenges of building national\r\nstructures and of achieving economic growth, the\r\nyoung States of Central Asia have faced a set of new\r\nthreats: radical religious movements, terrorist\r\nactivities, drugs and weapons trafficking. After the\r\ntragedy of 11 September, the international community\r\nfinally acknowledged the importance of stability in the\r\nregion and of the need to support reform efforts.\r\nTransition to full democracy in Central Asia should be\r\nseen as a process to be completed gradually as nation-\r\nbuilding, political stability and economic conditions\r\nare enhanced.\r\nThe United Nations is the vehicle for the\r\nrealization of global expectations. We know that its\r\nfuture rests to a great extent on its responsiveness to\r\nthe crisis of development in societies which have fallen\r\nbehind.\r\nAs things stand, the process of globalization, the\r\ndominant force of our time, has amply shown its\r\ninherent weaknesses, which are apt to create profound\r\nissues of imbalance and inequality. A case can be made\r\nin favour of globalizations ability to raise the level of\r\nprosperity, to reduce poverty and to enhance liberties.\r\nHowever, the fears of the masses cannot be completely\r\nallayed without evidence of more responsive\r\nmanagement of that process. Conflict, poverty,\r\ndiscrimination and injustice still blight the lives of\r\nmillions in every part of the globe. More than 80\r\ncountries now have per capita incomes lower than\r\nthose of a decade or more ago. Poverty is an offence to\r\nthe conscience of the modern world.\r\nIn view of all those considerations, Africa has a\r\nspecial and urgent claim to global engagement and\r\nconcern. My country supports efforts aimed at\r\nalleviating problems that afflict that continent. At this\r\ngathering, I wish to salute the birth of the African\r\nUnion. We hope that Africans will thus be able to work\r\nmore effectively to attain their goals.\r\nIn the same vein, Turkey has attributed great\r\nimportance to the achievement of the goals and\r\nprinciples adopted initially at the 1992 Rio Conference\r\non Environment and Development and compiled under\r\nAgenda 21. They have been our guidelines in\r\ncombating poverty and in protecting the global\r\nenvironment throughout the last decade, which has\r\nbrought us to the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, recently held in Johannesburg.\r\nBefore I conclude, I wish to underline one very\r\nimportant aspect of our foreign policy. Fifty years after\r\nthe cornerstone was laid, the integration of Europe is\r\ngaining further momentum. The dynamic of European\r\nUnion enlargement is opening up new horizons. The\r\nrecognition of Turkey as a candidate for accession to\r\nthe European Union has ushered in a new era in\r\nrelations between Turkey and the European Union.\r\nTurkey is determined to be part of the historic process\r\nof unifying Europe.\r\nThe past decade has presented us with many\r\nthreats to security. Each has created its own challenge.\r\nBut one fundamental lesson can be drawn from them\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nall: no single State or organization is able to meet those\r\nmodern challenges on its own. We need to work\r\ntogether closely. The United Nations is the very forum\r\nin which we can achieve international cooperation and\r\nharmonization to meet those challenges. As always,\r\nTurkey stands ready to do its utmost to contribute to\r\nthe realization of its noble goals.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Brian Cowen,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland.\r\nMr. Cowen (Ireland): I congratulate the Mr. Jan\r\nKavan on his election as President of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I look forward to\r\nworking closely with him as the Czech Republic, a\r\ngood friend of my country, moves ever closer to\r\nmembership in the European Union. Our thanks are due\r\nto Mr. Han Seung-soo for his work as President of the\r\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am\r\ndelighted to welcome Switzerland as a new Member of\r\nthe Organization and look forward to the imminent\r\nmembership of East Timor, a nation whose birth was\r\nfostered by this Organization.\r\nPrime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark has\r\nalready addressed the General Assembly on behalf of\r\nthe European Union. Ireland associates itself fully with\r\nhis remarks.\r\nWe are all still haunted, a year later, by the\r\nshadow of the terrible deaths and events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001. Last year in the delayed general\r\ndebate, I spoke about the implications of those\r\natrocities. I set out my thoughts on how we as the\r\ninternational community should respond. My\r\nconclusions last year and my message today are the\r\nsame.\r\nThe United Nations is at the centre of our system\r\nof collective security. It is a mirror of our\r\ndetermination and our political will. This is the world\r\nbody invested by the peoples of the world with unique\r\nlegitimacy and unique authority. Around the world\r\npeople look in hope and idealism to the United\r\nNations. We must be worthy of that trust.\r\nI want to fully endorse the Secretary-Generals\r\naddress to the Assembly yesterday. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral said, All States have a clear interest, as well\r\nas a clear responsibility, to uphold international law\r\nand maintain international order (see A/57/PV.2).\r\nStates must honour their international obligations.\r\nUnless we consistently call to account those who defy\r\nor flagrantly violate their obligations, our system will\r\nbe discredited.\r\nThe choice we face is stark. Either we stand by\r\nand strengthen the international system and the rule of\r\nlaw, or we invite anarchy. The great Irish poet W. B.\r\nYeats put it graphically in The Second Coming:\r\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\r\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world.\r\nThat was what the perpetrators of 11 September\r\nwanted. Their vicious attack was not just on the\r\ninnocent people  of many nationalities, including my\r\nown  in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania;\r\nnot just on the United States; but on the very values we\r\ncherish and that are the foundation on which this\r\nOrganization is built. They will have succeeded if we\r\nare provoked into abandoning those values and laws.\r\nUltimately they can be defeated, and the scourge of\r\ninternational terror ended, only if we stand united in\r\ndefence of our international obligations and the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\nWithin our system, the Security Council is\r\ncharged with responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. When there are threats\r\nto international peace and security, the Member States\r\nconcerned are obliged to bring these matters to the\r\nattention of the Security Council. When the Security\r\nCouncil acts in such cases, all Member States are\r\nobliged to implement its resolutions. Regrettably, they\r\nsometimes fail to do so.\r\nAny law that is flagrantly violated becomes\r\nweakened over time. That is why flagrant violation and\r\ndefiance of Security Council resolutions should be a\r\nmatter of the utmost concern to all Member States.\r\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September required an\r\nurgent response from the international community. It\r\nwas vital that the Security Council was at the centre of\r\nthe international communitys response. The Council,\r\nto quote the Secretary-General, responded with\r\npatience, creativity and determination.\r\nThe Security Council adopted resolution 1368\r\n(2001), demanding the fullest possible cooperation of\r\nthe international community in bringing the\r\nperpetrators to justice. It subsequently authorized the\r\ndeployment of an international security force to\r\nAfghanistan. It put in place measures to counter\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nThe establishment by the Security Council of the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to oversee the\r\nimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001) was a\r\nlandmark development. Its work has been instrumental\r\nin making it more difficult for international terrorist\r\nnetworks to organize and finance their activities.\r\nContinued persistence and vigilance are required.\r\nWe still have much more to do. We must make it\r\nimpossible for the agents of international terror to\r\noperate. We must persevere with initiatives such as the\r\nfreezing of assets and the denial of safe haven. At the\r\nsame time, we must ensure that everything we do\r\nrespects the United Nations Charter and the body of\r\ninternational human rights law we have so\r\npainstakingly constructed. That is our best guarantee\r\nagainst evil and its perpetrators.\r\nIn his address to the General Assembly yesterday,\r\nthe Secretary-General also correctly identified four\r\nserious current threats to world peace.\r\nFirst, on the Middle East, there can be no doubt\r\nthat there is a need for greater urgency in the efforts to\r\nbring an end to the conflict. The vision of Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\r\n(2002) must be implemented.\r\nFor far too long the Palestinian people have been\r\ndenied their legitimate rights. Today they exist in a\r\nstate of deep impoverishment. Ireland strongly believes\r\nthat in order to reach a settlement that will give the\r\nIsraeli people the security they deserve and that will\r\ngive the Palestinian people their legitimate rights and\r\nsovereignty, the parties must move forward. They must\r\nin particular address not just the security issues but\r\nalso the economic and humanitarian needs of\r\nPalestinians, and they must establish a concrete target\r\nfor a political settlement.\r\nFor its part, the European Union, working closely\r\nwith the United Nations, the United States and Russia\r\nthrough the quartet, will continue to encourage and\r\nassist the parties to end the conflict and move towards\r\na permanent peace.\r\nThis conflict has been an ongoing source of\r\nsuffering for the peoples of the region and also a focal\r\npoint of instability for the rest of the world. It remains\r\na threat of the utmost gravity to international peace and\r\nsecurity. We can and must give it the highest priority.\r\nSecondly, the Secretary-General mentioned Iraq.\r\nIraq has been in violation of Security Council\r\nresolutions, in particular on arms inspection, for some\r\nconsiderable time. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has\r\nbeen engaged in serious efforts to encourage Iraq to\r\ncomply with its obligations under those Security\r\nCouncil resolutions. We will continue to strongly\r\nsupport his good offices.\r\nLet us express wholehearted agreement with the\r\ncall by the Secretary-General for Iraq to comply with\r\nits obligations for the sake of its own people and for\r\nthe sake of world order. If Iraqs defiance continues,\r\nthe Security Council must face its responsibilities.\r\nWe call on Iraq to respect its obligations and to\r\nimplement in full and without preconditions all the\r\nSecurity Council resolutions addressed to it. The\r\nweapons inspectors must be allowed in to do the work\r\nauthorized by the Council. Iraqs leadership has it\r\nwithin its own power to end the current predicament\r\nand to alleviate the great hardship on its people. It\r\nshould do so without delay.\r\nThirdly, it is essential for the international\r\ncommunity to maintain its strong and active support for\r\nthe people and the Government of Afghanistan.\r\nAfghanistan has come through great trials over the past\r\nyear. We should not overlook the fact that, despite the\r\nbest efforts of the international coalition to ensure that\r\nthe use of force was targeted and proportionate, many\r\ninnocent Afghans have died. We should remember\r\nthem, too, in our thoughts and prayers. Ultimately, they\r\nare just as much victims of the terrorist groups who\r\ncarried out the attacks of 11 September as those who\r\nwere murdered in New York, Washington and\r\nPennsylvania.\r\nConsiderable progress has been achieved in\r\nAfghanistan with the help of the international\r\ncommunity. There are clear signs that, overall, the\r\nquality of life is improving. Nonetheless, there is still a\r\nlong way to go if Afghanistan is completely to escape\r\nthe violence and instability of the past.\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Afghanistan\r\nremains acute. The sustained and wholehearted support\r\nof the international community remains essential,\r\ntherefore, if progress is to be maintained.\r\nFor its part, Ireland has been active in the\r\nSecurity Council, particularly in highlighting the\r\nhumanitarian situation. We have pledged $12 million\r\nover the next three years, the majority of which has\r\n31\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nalready been dispensed. We are also contributing\r\npersonnel to the international stabilization force.\r\nFourthly, as regards India and Pakistan, we\r\nwelcome the decrease in tension between these two\r\ncountries. The risk of open conflict between two\r\nnuclear-capable countries is a matter of the utmost\r\nconcern to all of us. We encourage the leaders of India\r\nand Pakistan to address the underlying causes that give\r\nrise to the potential for conflict.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction  chemical, biological and nuclear  is,\r\nof course, an issue that goes far beyond Iraq. They\r\nrepresent a major threat to international peace and\r\nsecurity. The international instruments and regimes to\r\ncontrol the spread, and bring about the elimination, of\r\nsuch weapons must be strengthened and fully\r\nimplemented. Ultimately, the long-term control and\r\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction can be\r\nachieved only through a comprehensive and rigorous\r\nsystem of international treaties and obligations that are\r\nverifiable and universal.\r\nIreland, together with our New Agenda partners,\r\nwill continue its efforts in this regard during this years\r\nsession of the General Assembly. We call on all States\r\nthat are concerned about these issues to become more\r\nconstructively engaged in the period ahead.\r\nAll of us recognize that conflict prevention, not\r\njust conflict resolution, is the central challenge facing\r\nthe United Nations. Poverty, inequality and injustice\r\nare all too often the breeding ground for instability and\r\nfor threats to peace. They are an affront to the\r\ninternational conscience. We must tackle the injustices\r\nthat all too often allow conflict situations to develop.\r\nOur challenge is to show that there is a peaceful\r\nand legitimate way of dealing with these problems. It is\r\nonly through the development of integrated strategies\r\nthat address the underlying causes of conflict \r\npoverty, injustice and the abuse of fundamental rights\r\nand freedoms  that the international community can\r\nbring about long-term peace and stability.\r\nThe Millennium Summit Declaration confirmed\r\nthe commitment of the worlds leadership to tackling\r\nthe root causes of conflict. The Secretary-General has\r\nsince called for the United Nations to move from a\r\nculture of reaction to a culture of prevention. Ireland\r\nfully supports the implementation of the Secretary-\r\nGenerals report on conflict prevention (A/55/985).\r\nThe United Nations must be equipped with the\r\nnecessary tools to develop coherent conflict-prevention\r\npolicies. Let us commit ourselves to supporting the\r\nSecretary-General in his ongoing reform initiatives. We\r\nmust revitalize the General Assembly so that it can\r\nplay its proper role. Let us re-engage on reform of the\r\nSecurity Council so that it reflects modern geopolitical\r\nrealities. We need a Security Council which is as\r\nrepresentative as possible of the international\r\ncommunity, while being in a position to function\r\nefficiently, and we must provide the United Nations\r\nwith sufficient resources to meet its responsibilities.\r\nSustainable development focused on poverty\r\neradication is the most powerful instrument which the\r\ninternational community has to address the long-term\r\nroot causes of conflict and to promote peace. Let us\r\nalso remind ourselves of the international communitys\r\nlong-standing commitment to meeting the United\r\nNations target of spending 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product on overseas development assistance.\r\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\r\nheld in Johannesburg, my Prime Minister, Taoiseach\r\nBertie Ahern, confirmed Irelands commitment to meet\r\nthat target by 2007.\r\nLet us restate our commitment to providing\r\nuniversal access to basic health care. We must be\r\nrelentless in the campaign to eliminate diseases such as\r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The spread of\r\nthose diseases threatens to undermine our development\r\nprogrammes. We must step up our efforts to eradicate\r\nthem. We must aim for the targets set out in the\r\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by\r\nthe General Assembly in June 2001. We must ensure\r\nthat the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis\r\nand Malaria is adequately resourced.\r\nThe Johannesburg Summit agreed upon a global\r\ncomprehensive action plan for sustainable development\r\nwhich will help guide our policies and programmes in\r\nthe coming years. The Summit Declarations\r\ncommitment on sustainable development has the\r\npotential to make an important contribution to conflict\r\nprevention, particularly in Africa.\r\nEffective conflict prevention is also about putting\r\nnecessary structures in place. The Brahimi report on\r\nUnited Nations peace operations (A/55/305)\r\nacknowledged the pressing need to establish both long-\r\nterm and short-term conflict prevention strategies. I\r\nwould like to reiterate Irelands support for the\r\n32\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nSecretary-Generals initiatives and for the role that\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping has to play in an\r\nintegrated conflict prevention strategy.\r\nPeacekeeping is at the heart of Irelands\r\ncontribution to the United Nations. We are immensely\r\nproud of the contribution which Irish personnel have\r\nmade to United Nations peacekeeping. We reserve a\r\nspecial place in our hearts for those who have given\r\ntheir lives in the service of the United Nations. This\r\nwas demonstrated once again in a moving ceremony\r\nwhich was held to mark the standing down of the Irish\r\nbattalion from the United Nations Interim Force in\r\nLebanon after 24 years of service.\r\nAs a member of the European Union, Ireland\r\nwelcomes the deepening cooperation between the\r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations on conflict\r\nprevention and peacekeeping. This will be given\r\nfurther concrete expression when the European Union\r\ntakes over the United Nations police operation in\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina next January.\r\nRespect for human rights is a core dimension in\r\nconflict prevention. This is the very foundation on\r\nwhich peace and security surely depend. Human rights\r\nmust be integrated into all United Nations activities.\r\nThe entry into force of the Rome Statute establishing\r\nthe International Criminal Court sends a clear signal of\r\ndetermination to bring to justice those who perpetrate\r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. I\r\nwould urge those who have not ratified the Rome\r\nStatute to do so. The international community is at its\r\nstrongest when it stands unified, bound together by the\r\nstrength of the rule of law.\r\nI would like to take the opportunity presented by\r\nthis address to the General Assembly to pay tribute to\r\nMary Robinson, former President of Ireland, who has\r\njust completed her term as United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We are deeply proud\r\nof her achievements. We know that she will continue to\r\nbe a fearless champion of the universality of human\r\nrights.\r\nTurning to the situation in Northern Ireland, we\r\nhave seen substantial progress across the key areas of\r\nimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement since I\r\nlast addressed this Assembly. The political institutions\r\nof the Agreement are operating on a positive and\r\ninclusive basis, bringing tangible benefits across the\r\nboard. An independent international commission has\r\noverseen two acts of arms decommissioning by the\r\nIrish Republican Army. The Patten Commission\r\nreports vision of a new beginning for policing in\r\nNorthern Ireland is being progressively realized. I call\r\non all to fully play their part in laying a foundation for\r\nand strengthening the new policing arrangements.\r\nWelcome progress has been made in normalizing\r\nsecurity arrangements on the ground. However, more\r\nneeds to be done, and we need to see further early\r\nprogress, especially in the South Armagh area.\r\nThe considerable record of achievement,\r\nhowever, has not made us complacent about the\r\ndifficulties and challenges that remain. The level of\r\nstreet violence in the interface areas of Belfast and the\r\nsectarian attacks on vulnerable households, for\r\ninstance, have given us all cause for serious concern.\r\nThese have had a corrosive effect on community\r\nconfidence. They need to be addressed urgently in all\r\ntheir dimensions, including through effective policing\r\nmeasures leading to convictions.\r\nThe Irish and British Governments remain\r\nabsolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement\r\nand to its implementation in full. Its core principles \r\nconstitutional stability based on consent, partnership\r\npolitics, inclusive political institutions and structured\r\nNorth-South cooperation on the island of Ireland \r\nrepresent the only viable basis for a workable political\r\naccommodation. In short, the Agreement, which has\r\nbeen much praised and admired by States Members of\r\nthe Assembly, continues to be the only template for\r\npolitical progress in Northern Ireland.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to refer briefly to\r\nIrelands membership of the Security Council, which\r\ncomes to an end on 31 December 2002. Irelands\r\nexperience as a member of the Council has strongly\r\nreinforced our belief in the system of collective global\r\nsecurity. The central role of the Security Council in the\r\naftermath of 11 September 2001 underlined the\r\nimportance of its role as guardian of international\r\npeace and security. It must now build on that\r\nachievement. Ireland has, I believe, made a substantive\r\ncontribution to the work of the Council. We will seek\r\nto continue to do so in the remaining months of our\r\nterm. Our mission in the United Nations is to\r\ncontinually strive for a world that is fair and just. This\r\ncan best be done through our system of collective\r\nsecurity, through international economic and social\r\ndevelopment and through respect for human rights and\r\ninternational law. If we can commit ourselves to\r\nrespect the decisions of the Security Council and all\r\n33\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nour other international obligations, then innocent lives\r\ncan be saved and seemingly interminable conflicts\r\nresolved.\r\nWe have the methods and the means to peaceably\r\nresolve the dangers that threaten us. It should not be\r\nbeyond our talent and resources to achieve this. But to\r\ndo so, we need to assert the core values of\r\nmultilateralism in particular, and its capacity to\r\nachieve, for all our people, a better and safer world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Maria Soledad Alvear\r\nValenzuela, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chile.\r\nMs. Alvear (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf\r\nof my country, I congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan and the\r\nother members of the Bureau on their election. The\r\nPresident can count on the full cooperation of the\r\ndelegation of Chile for the success of his stewardship.\r\nThe Government of Chile takes this opportunity\r\nto welcome the accession to membership of the United\r\nNations of the Swiss Confederation and, soon, of\r\nTimor-Leste. The presence of Switzerland strengthens\r\nits historical association with the founding principles of\r\nthis Organization. The upcoming presence of Timor-\r\nLeste symbolizes the role of the United Nations in the\r\ncreation of a viable and democratic State. We are proud\r\nto have contributed to that mission.\r\nOne year ago, this city suffered a reprehensible\r\nterrorist attack that left an indelible stain on the\r\nconscience of mankind. That date, 11 September 2001,\r\nmarked a turning point in contemporary history. This\r\nepisode brought us face to face with new dimensions of\r\nour human vulnerability, with a fragility that\r\nuniversalized insecurity. The attack perpetrated a few\r\nkilometres from this place showed us, with frightful\r\ncruelty, that human coexistence urgently requires new\r\napproaches and new instruments.\r\nIt has become necessary for Governments and\r\nsocieties to forge positive responses and to work\r\ntogether to resolutely confront terrorism. In a\r\nglobalized world, it is imperative that we re-evaluate\r\nmultilateralism, and Chile would like to renew its\r\ncommitment in that regard.\r\nWe believe that, at this period of history, we have\r\nto make every effort to bring about a safer world. That\r\nchallenge should unite societies and cultures. As the\r\nSecretary-General pointed out yesterday, the United\r\nNations alone has the legitimacy necessary to\r\ncontribute to an effective system of security.\r\nComplying with Security Council resolutions is a\r\nresponsibility incumbent upon everyone, and is\r\nessential to the future of the Organization.\r\nThe changes that have taken place in recent years\r\nhave created new challenges and responsibilities for\r\nthe world that we must assume, and to which we must\r\nrespond, as a global society. The risks today are indeed\r\nboth global and without boundaries. Both States and\r\nordinary men and women in every part of the world\r\nnow face a new environment of uncertainty. In that\r\ncontext, traditional notions of security  which were\r\nformulated against the backdrop of threats from State\r\nactors  have been overtaken. A safer world requires\r\nthat we build consensus and that we develop new\r\napproaches that both take into account the multi-\r\ndimensional nature of threats and place people at the\r\ncentre of their concerns.\r\nIn such a security scenario it is urgent that we\r\npromote a comprehensive focus at the global level to\r\ndeal with new threats and to build a world free of fear\r\nand poverty. The concept of human security has\r\nemerged from just that sort of change. We would like\r\npeople to be at the centre of every multilateral\r\ndeliberation. That was the priority that Chile put forth a\r\ndecade ago with its initiative to hold a summit on\r\nsocial development. It is that same concern that has led\r\nto our participation in the Human Security Network, of\r\nwhich Chile has been the coordinator this year.\r\nHuman security is linked to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security, public order and the\r\nsocial environment. Those elements should be\r\npromoted through innovative and effective strategies.\r\nChiles candidacy for a seat on the Security\r\nCouncil for the period 2003-2004  which has the\r\nsupport of the Group of Latin American and the\r\nCaribbean States, for which we once again express our\r\nappreciation  seeks to strengthen the multilateral\r\napproach to crises that threaten international peace and\r\nsecurity, as well as to place human security at the\r\ncentre of the concerns of that main body of the United\r\nNations.\r\nRespect for human rights is a fundamental\r\nrequirement in the search for a world that is free from\r\nfear, more secure and full of hope. Human rights are a\r\nsource of political and social legitimacy in the\r\ncontemporary international system and provide\r\nguidelines for its actions. As a member of the\r\n34\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nCommission on Human Rights, our country will\r\nparticipate in initiatives to strengthen the fundamental\r\nand unique role of that body. Similarly, democracy too\r\nis a universal value, one which is expressed mainly\r\nthrough free elections and change in governance.\r\nStrengthening democracy requires integrity,\r\ntransparency and good governance. That is the proper\r\nway to create a democratic environment in which a\r\nsociety can be better integrated, protected and imbued\r\nwith meaning.\r\nMy country constructively supports and promotes\r\nthe spread of the values of democracy and democratic\r\nthinking throughout the world. In our region,\r\ndemocracy is a fundamental value. The adoption of the\r\nInter-American Democratic Charter represents a step\r\nforward in the continuing effort to further refine and\r\nstrengthen democracy. In that vein, we welcome the\r\nestablishment of the Community of Democracies as a\r\nconcerted attempt to make universal the values inherent\r\nin democracy.\r\nThe cultural dimension, as an expression of a\r\nmodern vision, must be part of our efforts to build a\r\nsafer world. Intercultural dialogue and respect for\r\ndiversity are fundamental elements of civilized\r\nrelations between nations. We believe that intercultural\r\ndialogue should contribute to strengthening the\r\nuniversal values of human dignity.\r\nInternational terrorism is a negation of the values\r\nthat make possible civilized coexistence, in which there\r\nmust be room for the diversity of the world. Terrorism\r\nis the greatest risk facing the global community in\r\nbuilding a safer world. Political commitment is\r\ntherefore needed to agree on effective efforts to\r\neradicate terrorism within the framework of\r\ninternational law. Intercultural dialogue is essential to\r\ndevelop a global strategy to combat terrorism. The\r\nUnited Nations plays an essential role as the leading\r\norganization in the fight against terrorism. The work of\r\nthe Security Council and of its Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee, established pursuant to Council resolution\r\n1373 (2001), and the development of a general\r\nconvention on international terrorism are efforts that\r\nwe support and to which we will continue to\r\ncontribute. A convention on terrorism has been adopted\r\nat the regional level, and we will continue to intensify\r\nour cooperation through the Inter-American Committee\r\non Terrorism and the Common Market of the South.\r\nThe risks and threats to global security, which are\r\nbeyond the effective control of States, highlight the\r\nnature of globalization in our world today. Indeed, the\r\ncharacteristics of globalization can be seen in such\r\nphenomena as the globalization of markets, the\r\nintensification of social relations and the broadening of\r\ncultural exchanges and communications. At the same\r\ntime, however, risks have also become global and the\r\nimbalances resulting from the unequal distribution of\r\nwealth have increased, thereby accentuating the trend\r\ntowards the marginalization and exclusion of\r\ncommunities, countries and regions.\r\nWe believe in the benefits of economic and\r\npolitical globalization. But we also believe that\r\nglobalization requires good governance and a\r\nsystematic and shared effort by the international\r\ncommunity to establish the rules of the new\r\ninternational system. We believe that there should be\r\ngreater participation in this effort, as well as ongoing\r\nconsultations with our citizens and our civil societies.\r\nThe United Nation system is an indispensable forum\r\nfor addressing these challenges.\r\nJust as we believe that the process of\r\nglobalization in which we are now engaged requires\r\nclear rules in order for its benefits to reach all of\r\nmankind, we also believe that the economic growth and\r\nprosperity of countries require freedom, democracy and\r\nsecurity in this global world. Chile had adopted a\r\nmodel that assigns to the market and to the private\r\nsector a key role in its development plans, within a\r\nframework of democracy and solidarity. We are\r\nconvinced that active participation in international\r\ntrade is a positive way of achieving growth, increasing\r\nemployment, being innovative in the area of\r\ntechnology and being effective in the allocation of\r\nresources.\r\nBased on our commitment to development with\r\nequity, we have opened up our economy, our\r\ncommunications and our culture; and we are satisfied\r\nat having done so. We believe, based on our\r\nexperience, that globalization can be a source of\r\nopportunity for all nations, particularly for small and\r\nremote countries such as ours, which are far from the\r\nmajor consumer centres and international flows.\r\nIn order for the efforts of nations such as ours to\r\nbe rewarded, however, it is essential for international\r\ntrade to be fair, to have clear-cut, established rules, and\r\nto avoid measures that distort it. Subsidies and lax\r\n35\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nimplementation of anti-dumping measures are\r\nobstacles to the achievement of that goal. In this\r\nconnection, I wish to place special emphasis on the\r\nurgent need for the liberalization of the trade in\r\nagricultural products. Many developing countries,\r\nincluding my own, are highly competitive in this\r\nsector, but the benefits are lost because of\r\nprotectionism in the developed countries.\r\nWe argued forcefully in Doha and Monterrey that\r\nin order for there to be growth, there must be access to\r\nmarkets. As President Ricardo Lagos stated in\r\nMonterrey, If trade barriers were eliminated, the\r\ndeveloping countries would have the potential to earn\r\n$130 billion, more than twice the $50 billion that we\r\nproposed as a target for the Millennium Summit.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to continue its efforts\r\nto promote the integrated activities of the various\r\nmultilateral political, economic and financial agencies\r\nthat are helping to achieve a world of greater\r\ndevelopment, equity and security.\r\nAs the multilateral system continues to develop\r\nculturally, socially and politically, Chile will continue\r\nto promote the mainstreaming of the gender\r\nperspective into the various activities of the\r\ninternational system and its subsystems. We also\r\nsupport the creation of opportunities for participation\r\nby civil society organizations.\r\nThe more developed, more equitable and safer\r\nworld to which we aspire also requires us to establish\r\ninternational standards for the protection of the rights\r\nof vulnerable groups. Chile will continue to encourage\r\nthe conclusion of agreements that contribute to the\r\nformulation and improvement of public policies in this\r\nfield. I would like to underscore our political\r\ncommitment to achieving a comprehensive convention\r\nthat protects and promotes the rights and dignity of\r\npeople with disabilities. Integration, recognition of the\r\ndignity of people and equality of opportunity for all are\r\nthe basic precepts of a more secure society.\r\nWe are convinced that we need to commit\r\nourselves as an international community to more active\r\npolicies for the protection of the environment. Few\r\nissues on the international agenda affect us all equally\r\nas much as this one and, paradoxically, few generate as\r\nmany disputes. The Johannesburg Summit confirmed\r\nmy belief that we must work towards consensus on\r\nbasic concepts.\r\nThe right to live in a socially acceptable\r\nenvironment is an ethical imperative of the present day.\r\nWe must therefore give priority to a global\r\nenvironmental agenda that focuses on improving legal\r\nnorms relating to, and providing better protection for,\r\nthe oceans, the climate, the atmosphere and the ozone\r\nlayer.\r\nGiven the direct impact that this issue has on\r\ndevelopment, I wish to note that, in December 2003, at\r\nConcepción, Chile, the World Biotechnology Forum\r\nwill take place under the sponsorship of the United\r\nNations Industrial Development Organization and the\r\nGovernment of Chile.\r\nWith regard to the political dimension, which\r\nemphasizes security, human rights, democracy and the\r\nfight against terrorism, I would like to refer to certain\r\nareas of the world that are of greatest concern to the\r\ninternational community. Latin America is a region in\r\nwhich democracy is the norm, even though in some\r\ncases it is fragile. The nations of our continent have\r\nlearned how difficult it is to build and sustain\r\ndemocratic institutions based on universal principles\r\nand values. We have a number of regional and\r\nsubregional mechanisms that compel us to fulfil this\r\nobligation. The Rio Group is without doubt the most\r\nimportant of these.\r\nThe world is aware of the current economic crisis\r\nin our region. This is a paradoxical situation. Latin\r\nAmerica responded properly to the challenge and\r\nadopted many of the structural economic reforms that\r\nwere asked of it, which led to a degree of liberalization\r\nwithout precedent in its history. The developed world,\r\nhowever, is sending contradictory signals that test the\r\nfaith of those of us who view globalization and the\r\nsystem of free trade as the basis for the development of\r\nour peoples. Those of us who believe that globalization\r\nmust be based on the principles of competitiveness\r\nwithout exclusion thus see, on a regular basis,\r\nrestrictions placed on our products; these are very\r\ndifficult to explain. This casts doubt on the existence of\r\na desire to move towards a globalization without\r\ncompartmentalization.\r\nBecause of its gravity, I must refer to a conflict\r\nthat affects the entire international community. Chile\r\nwishes to express its deep concern at the grave\r\nsituation in the Middle East in the light of the impasse\r\nin the peace negotiations aimed at finding a solution to\r\nthe crisis between Palestinians and Israelis. The\r\n36\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\ncontinuing escalation of the violence that began in the\r\nregion on 28 September 2000 continues to claim many\r\nvictims and to cause heavy material damage, and\r\nthreatens to spread throughout the region, thereby\r\nposing a serious danger to international peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Government of Chile reiterates the need for\r\nthe strict implementation of the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council and recourse to constructive\r\nnegotiation, with a view to achieving a just,\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace that make possible\r\nthe creation of a viable Palestinian State and\r\ncoexistence with the State of Israel within secure and\r\ninternationally recognized borders. A world in which\r\nPalestinians and Israelis can live together will be a\r\nmore secure world.\r\nWe share the international sense of urgency that\r\nthe Government of Iraq must abide by the provisions of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions in the interest of regional\r\nand global security. We are convinced that in this\r\nglobalized world it is essential for us to act in\r\naccordance with the principles and values promoted by\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIn Africa we now see signs of hope. Chile wishes\r\nto express its firm support for the African continent in\r\nits decision to create modern regional instruments, such\r\nas the African Union and the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development. We hope that these initiatives,\r\nto which Africans themselves have referred to as the\r\nAfrican renaissance, will generate in the international\r\ncommunity a response commensurate with those\r\nefforts. This is a new challenge for the twenty-first\r\ncentury, and the United Nations must be involved.\r\nChile, a small nation that looks out at the world\r\nfrom the South, has developed important links of\r\ninternational solidarity in the most diverse\r\ndirections  in Latin America as part of the inter-\r\nAmerican system; in its association with the European\r\nUnion; and as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic\r\nCooperation organization. In opting for open\r\nmultilateralism, we are facing todays challenge of\r\nworking towards a more secure world  a world free\r\nfrom fear and poverty. We will encounter obstacles\r\nwhich we must confront with shared political resolve.\r\nThis is the responsibility of all the countries\r\nrepresented here today in the General Assembly.\r\nLet us advance towards global human security.\r\nLet us combat terrorism, poverty and misery in the\r\nsearch for a more democratic and more tolerant society.\r\nIn this challenge, Chile is convinced that\r\nmultilateralism can and must contribute to overcoming\r\nthe insecurity currently prevailing in the world. The\r\nUnited Nations offers such an opportunity to the\r\ninternational community. It is a forum that can and\r\nmust seek consensual solutions to the inescapable\r\nproblems now plaguing humankind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Guillermo Pérez-\r\nCadalso Arias, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nHonduras.\r\nMr. Pérez-Cadalso Arias (Honduras) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The recognized leadership of Mr. Jan Kavan\r\nwill guarantee the success of our debates. Together\r\nwith congratulating him on his election to the\r\npresidency, I should like to assure him that he can\r\ncount on my Governments full cooperation in his\r\nwork.\r\nI come to this universal forum on behalf of a\r\npeople which last November renewed its commitment\r\nto democracy. Representing the constitutional\r\nGovernment headed by Mr. Ricardo Maduro Joest, who\r\nhas made the welfare of his people the essence of his\r\nmandate, I come with a message of peace and\r\nfriendship from Honduras addressed to all the nations\r\ngathered here.\r\nMy countrys Government, born of the will of the\r\npeople through a free and transparent election regarded\r\nas a model, has in a few months brought about changes\r\nthat have strengthened Honduran democracy. It has\r\nimplemented historic institutional reforms, such as the\r\ndepoliticization of the Supreme Court of Justice, the\r\ndisallowing of participation in the presidential election\r\nfrom positions of political advantage, the creation of a\r\nhigher accounting tribunal to exercise overall monetary\r\ncontrol, and the depoliticization of the national\r\nelectoral tribunal. Moreover, it has developed civil\r\nsecurity schemes and measures that are effective and\r\nrespectful of human rights, all within a context of\r\ntransparency in administrative management and a head-\r\non campaign against corruption and extreme poverty.\r\nAs a Government, we are doing what we\r\nresponsibly must do, and in that work we wish to\r\ncontinue to rely on the friendly and respectful\r\nassistance of the international community, to which we\r\nlikewise offer our solidarity and cooperation.\r\nMoreover, I come to the Assembly with the firm\r\n37\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nresolve to associate my country with the efforts of all\r\nMember States to realize fully the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the San Francisco Charter. I come to the\r\nOrganization also to offer my Governments\r\ncooperation in the building of peace, in the\r\nmaintenance of international security and in the forging\r\nof a global alliance for human development.\r\nThe day 11 September 2001 is an indelible date in\r\nthe history of humanity. The unprecedented terrorist\r\nattacks changed for ever the face of New York, the\r\niron Babel, which, despite its great sorrow and grief,\r\ncontinues to offer us its hospitality. Thousands of\r\nfamilies belonging to many peoples of the United\r\nNations, including mine, were plunged into grief and\r\npain on that fateful day. Our condolences and solidarity\r\nare with them.\r\nAs it did on that tragic occasion, the Government\r\nof Honduras condemns terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations. Accordingly, I take this opportunity to\r\nreaffirm in this world forum our unswerving\r\ncommitment to use all our skill and energy to combat\r\nthis scourge that threatens civilized coexistence among\r\nnations. With the same conviction, Honduras reaffirms\r\nits resolve to cooperate with other democratic nations\r\nin the common undertaking to eradicate this evil, thus\r\nbuilding a better and less violent world.\r\nSince 11 September 2001, many things have\r\nchanged. However, other threats persist and continue to\r\nloom over our peoples, making increasingly imperative\r\nthe quest for new consensus and greater commitments.\r\nFollowing the Millennium Summit, three conferences\r\nat the highest level and of the most far-reaching\r\nimportance have been held in recent months. Our heads\r\nof State or Government met first in Monterrey to\r\nconsider the issues of financing for development, later\r\nin Rome to address the problem of world hunger and,\r\nmost recently, in Johannesburg to debate the great\r\nchallenges of sustainable development. From each of\r\nthose conferences, we have emerged moderately\r\nsatisfied in terms of concrete results. However, we\r\nrecognize that the dialogue must continue so that we\r\ncan together seek new forms of cooperation to alleviate\r\nthe hunger and pain of a large part of humanity, whose\r\nvery survival is in danger as a result of the vortex of\r\neconomic development taking place at the cost of the\r\nplanets destruction.\r\nAll of those commitments demand a United\r\nNations revitalized in its action and strengthened in its\r\ninternal structure. The time has come to reconsider\r\ncreatively and with greater determination the\r\norganizational structure of the Security Council, an\r\norgan that cannot continue to turn its back on a reality\r\nis very different from that of 1945. Honduras will not\r\nrest in its insistence on the need to abolish or restrict\r\nthe right of veto enjoyed by some Members of the\r\nOrganization. Likewise, my country believes that the\r\nStates contributing to development should have a seat\r\nand participate in the debate and work of that important\r\nUnited Nations organ.\r\nThe time has come to join in our resolve to seek\r\nmechanisms and decisions that will secure the full\r\nparticipation of all the peoples and nations of the Earth.\r\nIt is time for those who have been Members of the\r\nOrganization to return. For that reason, Honduras\r\nbelieves that we should not continue the practice of\r\nexcluding from our debates and our work concrete\r\nrealities such as Taiwan, a country whose participation\r\ncould offer new opportunities for cooperation for the\r\nbenefit of many peoples, and which, in turn could\r\nbenefit from our activity and decisions.\r\nIn essence, Honduras pleads for a new United\r\nNations in which all peoples and nations enjoy full\r\nrepresentation and in which there is more just and\r\nbalanced representativity in the discussions and in the\r\nresultant resolutions. In this context, Honduras\r\nwelcomes the accession of Switzerland and the\r\nincorporation of Timor-Leste into our world\r\nOrganization. I take this opportunity to wish them the\r\nwarmest of welcomes.\r\nIn the broad and comprehensive vision of what, in\r\nmy Governments opinion, this Organization should be,\r\nspecial mention must be made of the International\r\nCourt of Justice, since it is the jurisdictional organ of\r\nthe United Nations system and all States Members have\r\ncommitted themselves to complying with its decisions\r\nin the cases to which they are party.\r\nJust as Honduras endorses the principles and\r\npractices of international law that promote human\r\nsolidarity, respect for the self-determination of peoples,\r\nnon-interference and the safeguarding of universal\r\npeace and democracy, we also proclaim the validity\r\nand compulsory application of international arbitration\r\nand judicial rulings to be irrevocable. Consistent with\r\nthis state philosophy, my country is absolutely\r\nconvinced that compliance with international rulings\r\nhanded down by a competent international court, as\r\n38\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nwell as good-faith compliance with the commitments\r\nundertaken by means of treaty, will guarantee peace,\r\nharmony and security among peoples and\r\nGovernments.\r\nHonduras feels that the very credibility of a\r\ncountry is at stake when it complies or fails to comply\r\nwith the obligations arising from an international\r\nruling. As for Honduras, the resolution of a competent\r\ninternational court has constitutional weight and its\r\neffects require immediate execution, for we believe\r\nthat law and legality are unshirkable imperatives of the\r\nnew international order. Moreover, in my\r\nGovernments opinion, they are the cornerstone of\r\ninternational society in this century.\r\nPrompted by this conviction, in January my\r\ncountry turned to the Security Council, in its capacity\r\nas guarantor of the implementation of the rulings of the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, in seeking the requisite\r\ncooperation to ensure compliance with the ruling that\r\nthe Court handed down 10 years ago in the dispute\r\nwhich, by common agreement with the Republic of El\r\nSalvador, we submitted to it for consideration and\r\ndecision. Recent events in our countries have led us to\r\nbelieve that the implementation of the ruling will begin\r\nvery soon as a result of talks between the Presidents of\r\nthe two nations. We sincerely hope that this may be the\r\ncase, both because we do not wish to distract the\r\nSecurity Councils attention from this matter, which is\r\nof importance to our peoples and to the validity of\r\ninternational public law itself, and because we wish to\r\npromote the process of integration to which the whole\r\nof Central America is now committed.\r\nThe Central American isthmus is going through a\r\nspecial moment in its history. There is a resolve among\r\nour Governments to grasp the future together and,\r\naccordingly, we have agreed to promote the creation of\r\na customs union among the partners of the regional\r\nintegration system, which should be established by\r\nDecember 2003. This renewed integration, as we call\r\nit, offers opportunities both for our collectivity and for\r\nour neighbours and partners in development, as in the\r\ncase of Mexico with the Puebla-Panamá plan.\r\nImportant challenges are also being met in concert,\r\nsuch as the negotiation of a free-trade treaty with the\r\nUnited States of America. We intend later to repeat the\r\nexperience with the European Union.\r\nDespite the significant progress that has been\r\nmade, and as in other regional systems of States,\r\npractices persist that impede the full development of\r\nour trade relations. Fortunately, we are striving to\r\novercome these obstacles through dialogue and\r\nsolutions appropriate to civilized nations which\r\nunderstand that, given our common past, we share a\r\ncommon future.\r\nAt the present time, there are grounds for grave\r\nconcern in the face of events and realities that threaten\r\ninternational peace and security. The situation in the\r\nMiddle East has been a constant cause of concern to\r\nall. Honduras appeals to the men and women of that\r\nregion to repudiate and renounce violence and thus\r\ngive peace a chance for the sake of a generation of\r\nchildren who see and experience nothing but violence\r\nas they grow. This and other bloody conflicts require us\r\nto rethink and reformulate new ideas for prompt action.\r\nWe need to globalize solidarity and human\r\ndevelopment. The great challenges of this century\r\nrequire us to increase the worldwide presence of the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the World\r\nFood Programme, the World Health Organization, the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization, the United Nations Environment\r\nProgramme and other entities and agencies of our\r\nsystem, whose work effectively contributes to\r\nestablishing the conditions to ensure that all boys, girls,\r\nmen and women of all ages, regardless of their ethnic\r\norigin, colour or religious creed, may live in an\r\nenvironment conducive to the full exercise of their\r\nrights.\r\nIn this context, the peoples of the world are\r\ncalling for concerted action on the part of our\r\nGovernments to make the United Nations the worlds\r\nmost efficient Organization for addressing the\r\nchallenges posed by the millions of men, women and\r\nchildren infected by the HIV virus; by others, suffering\r\nunemployment, who have entered the most destitute\r\nsectors of society; and by the more than 40 million\r\nboys and girls who wander or simply live on the\r\nstreets.\r\nOver time, crimes against humanity have\r\nmotivated concerted action on the part of all peoples to\r\ndevelop new and advanced schemes for international\r\nprotection. That is the case with the new International\r\nCriminal Court, to which Honduras is honoured to be\r\nparty. We applaud this revolutionary effort in the\r\nadministration of criminal justice and hope that, sooner\r\n39\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nrather than later, all the States Members of the United\r\nNations will join it.\r\nI wish to conclude my statement by emphasizing\r\nthat the great challenges we face in todays world\r\ndemand concerted and global action. If we truly wish\r\nto see the planet survive and, with it, the human race,\r\nthe time has come to work together responsibly to\r\nforge real partnerships for human development and\r\nsustainable development for all the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting. A representative has asked to speak in\r\nright of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): The delegation of\r\nPakistan has asked for the floor to respond to the\r\nrhetoric against my country that was delivered this\r\nmorning by the Prime Minister of India. We had hoped\r\nfor a response from him to the call for de-escalation\r\nand dialogue that was offered by the President of\r\nPakistan in his address yesterday. Instead, we heard the\r\nusual diatribe against my country.\r\nThe Prime Minister spoke about nuclear\r\nblackmail. Let me remind him that it was India that\r\nmoved its troops to the frontiers of Pakistan. It was\r\nMr. Vajpayee himself who in May threatened a decisive\r\nbattle against Pakistan. It was India that introduced\r\nnuclear weapons to South Asia. It was India that\r\ninitiated the nuclear explosions in 1998. It was India\r\nthat declared itself a nuclear-weapon State after those\r\nexplosions. It was India that announced a nuclear\r\ndoctrine that involves the deployment of a triad of\r\nnuclear weapons on land, sea and air. It was the Indian\r\narmy chief who, on 11 January, said that Pakistan could\r\nbe threatened with a strike which could make its\r\ncontinuation in any form doubtful. That is nuclear\r\nblackmail.\r\nPakistan has proposed a nuclear-weapon-free\r\nzone for 20 years. We proposed nuclear restraint after\r\nthe explosions. President Musharraf has said that the\r\nuse of nuclear weapons should be unthinkable and that\r\nour conventional defence is sufficient to deter India.\r\nWe have even proposed the denuclearization of South\r\nAsia. Let India respond positively to our proposals.\r\nIf India sincerely wants to avoid war, all Prime\r\nMinister Vajpayee had to do was to accept our\r\nPresidents offer to withdraw the troops to peacetime\r\nlocations, to accept the reinstallation of the ceasefire\r\nand the Line of Control which we had observed in 2000\r\nand to resume the dialogue which was started and\r\nalmost formalized in a declaration at Agra and which\r\nwas agreed between my President and Prime Minister\r\nVajpayee but was scuttled by certain hard-liners in the\r\nIndian Government.\r\nA dialogue is necessary when two countries have\r\ndifferences. That dialogue must address the underlying\r\ncauses of their differences and tensions. That is what\r\nthe Secretary-General and so many other people of\r\ngood will have called for. But the Indian Prime\r\nMinister even admonished them for suggesting that we\r\nshould address the underlying causes of our\r\ndifferences.\r\nIn a rare admission, however, the Indian Prime\r\nMinister admitted that there was a call for a plebiscite\r\nin Kashmir to decide its future. That plebiscite was\r\ncalled for by the United Nations Security Council \r\nyes, 50 years ago, but it was repeated several times. A\r\nSecurity Council resolution does not become time-\r\nbarred. After all, resolution 242 (1967) also is 35 years\r\nold. It is certainly not time-barred. No Security Council\r\nresolution is time-barred until it is implemented. India\r\nhas been the biggest violator for the longest time of the\r\nmost number of Security Council resolutions adopted\r\nby this international Organization.\r\nSelf-determination is an inherent right given by\r\nthe Charter. It cannot be extinguished until it is\r\nexercised. The people of Jammu and Kashmir have that\r\nright to self-determination. That right to self-\r\ndetermination will not be extinguished until India\r\naccepts the exercise by the people of Jammu and\r\nKashmir through what the Security Council has called\r\nfor: a United Nations-supervised plebiscite. India\r\nremains in violation of Security Council resolutions\r\nuntil it accepts that. We all heard yesterday that\r\nSecurity Council resolutions must be implemented. We\r\nendorse that statement.\r\nThe Prime Minister of India spoke about elections\r\nin Kashmir. The Security Council has declared that\r\nsuch elections in Kashmir cannot be a substitute for the\r\n40\r\nA/57/PV.5\r\nplebiscite. But no election can be free and fair when it\r\nis held under the jackboots of 700,000 thousand troops\r\nthat India has deployed in Kashmir. No election can be\r\nfair when India refuses the suggestion  made, among\r\nothers, by the Secretary of State of the United States \r\nto accept international monitors to see that these\r\nelections are fair. No election can be fair when 25 of\r\nthe 40 leaders of the Kashmiri All Parties Hurriyat\r\nConference (APHC), the conglomerate of 35 political\r\nparties of Kashmir, remain in Indian jails.\r\nNobody has to interfere with these so-called\r\nelections. These elections have been refused by the\r\nAPAC. They have been refused by the Kashmiri\r\npeople. In fact, these so-called elections were dead on\r\narrival.\r\nThe Indian Prime Minister spoke about the large\r\nnumber of Muslims in India. He said that there were\r\n150 million. We think he exaggerates. But certainly, the\r\nnumbers will not go up if the Hindu majority, which\r\nMr. Vajpayee leads in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),\r\ncontinues the practice of massacring Muslims every\r\nfew weeks.\r\nSince 1947, there have been 150,000 communal\r\nriots in India  3,000 such riots every year. In\r\nFebruary this year, 2,000 Kashmiris were killed\r\nmercilessly by mobs organized with the complicity of\r\nthe State Chief Minister and his Government. More\r\nthan 2,000 innocent men, women and children were\r\nmassacred. Women were raped. Pregnant women were\r\nkilled in cold blood. There has been no accountability\r\nfor that act of genocide against the Muslims of Gujarat.\r\nThere has been a cover-up by the Government in New\r\nDelhi. And there has been silence in this world and in\r\nthis Hall.\r\nMr. Vajpayee spoke about communal harmony\r\nbeing the signature tune of Indian civilization. Well, we\r\nthink that this signature tune is designed to lull the\r\nworld while they continue the carnage of innocent\r\nMuslims.\r\nIndia poses as the largest democracy in the world.\r\nWe all know this corrupt democracy. It is, in our view,\r\nthe largest hypocrisy of this world. In its short history,\r\nIndia has emerged as a State with a clear proclivity\r\ntowards resorting to force or the threat of the use of\r\nforce. It has undertaken the largest number of conflicts\r\nwith its neighbours. It has a conflict or dispute with\r\nevery one of its neighbours. It has 16 internal conflicts\r\nwhich are taking place. It is a country and a society\r\nriven by division and the multiple apartheid of the\r\ncaste system. This is a country which comes here to\r\npreach and lecture on democracy and terrorism. We do\r\nnot accept the credentials of this hypocrisy.\r\nWe ask the Assembly to call on India to stop the\r\nmassacre of Muslims, to stop the massacre of\r\nKashmiris and to implement the resolutions of the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): A\r\nrepresentative has requested to exercise the right of\r\nreply according to the same rules. I give the floor to the\r\nrepresentative of India.\r\nMrs. Singh (India): It is regrettable that the\r\nrepresentative of Pakistan has chosen to attack the\r\nperson of the Prime Minister of India and has chosen\r\nthis forum of the General Assembly to do so.\r\nGiven the tenor of the statement made by\r\nPakistan in the General Assembly yesterday, perhaps\r\nwe could not have expected anything better. Our\r\npositions on all issues have been clearly enunciated by\r\nthe Prime Minister of India in his statement today. We\r\ndo not wish to dignify the remarks made by the\r\ndelegation of Pakistan with a reply.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.20 p.m.\r\n"
