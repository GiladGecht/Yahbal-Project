(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Major-General Joseph Kabila, President\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo.\r\nMajor-General Joseph Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Major-General Joseph Kabila,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila (spoke in French): I am\r\nhonoured and gratified once again to take the floor\r\nbefore the Assembly, to which I extend the most\r\ncordial greetings on behalf of the Congolese people, its\r\nGovernment and on my own behalf.\r\nFirst and foremost, allow me, Sir, to congratulate\r\nyou very sincerely, along with the whole of your\r\nBureau, on your election to the presidency of the fifty-\r\nseventh regular session of the General Assembly.\r\nI wish also to convey to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo, our great appreciation for the\r\nextremely important work that he accomplished during\r\nhis term in office.\r\nAllow me also to welcome the accession to the\r\nUnited Nations of the Swiss Confederation and of\r\nTimor-Leste as Member States.\r\nLastly, allow me to thank the Secretary-General\r\nfor his dedication to universal values and for his active\r\ninvolvement in the quest for solutions to the conflicts\r\nbesetting humankind.\r\nAt a time when the whole world is remembering\r\nthe fateful date of 11 September 2001, the Congolese\r\npeople, its Government and I myself wish to take this\r\nopportunity to convey once again our solidarity and our\r\ncompassion to the American people and to the grieving\r\nfamilies around the world who were victimized in this\r\nheinous act of terrorism.\r\nThis is indeed an appropriate setting in which to\r\nurge all peace-loving and justice-loving States in the\r\nworld to commit to working together to combat this\r\nevil in all its forms.\r\nFor its part, as I had announced in my address to\r\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, my\r\nGovernment, on 21 December 2001, established a\r\nnational coordinating committee to combat\r\ninternational terrorism, pursuant to Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001).\r\nThe first part of my statement will focus on the\r\nstatus of the peace process in the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo.\r\nExternally speaking, it should be noted that, faced\r\nwith obstruction to the implementation of the Lusaka\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nAgreement as regards the withdrawal of foreign forces,\r\nmy Government, basing itself on the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Security Council that encourage\r\nbilateral discussions, has entered into the Pretoria\r\nAgreement with Rwanda on the one hand, with the\r\nfacilitation of South Africa and the assistance of the\r\nUnited Nations, and, on the other hand, it has signed\r\nthe Luanda Agreement with Uganda, under the\r\nsponsorship of Angola.\r\nThe Pretoria Agreement, signed on 30 July 2002,\r\nessentially addresses the question of the withdrawal of\r\nRwandan troops from the territory of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and the disarmament of the\r\nformer Rwandan Army (ex-FAR) forces and the\r\nInterahamwe. The Luanda Agreement, signed on 6\r\nSeptember 2002, deals with the issue of the complete\r\nwithdrawal of Ugandan troops from the territory of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, as well as with\r\ncooperation and the normalization of relations between\r\nour two States.\r\nAlmost 45 days have passed since the signing of\r\nthe Pretoria Agreement — half of the time period set\r\nby the timetable for its implementation — without any\r\nsignificant progress having been made on the ground.\r\nThe commitment undertaken yesterday by the President\r\nof Rwanda to begin the withdrawal of troops as from\r\nnext week may mark a decisive phase in the\r\nimplementation of the Pretoria Agreement.\r\nFor its part, the Government of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, consistent with the\r\ncommitments that it has undertaken, had already\r\nassembled at Kamina more than 2,000 Rwandan ex-\r\ncombatants, who are awaiting repatriation to Rwanda.\r\nFurthermore, it has notified the third party, as of 5\r\nSeptember 2002, about additional information\r\nconcerning Rwandan ex-combatants.\r\nWith regard to the Luanda Agreement, it should\r\nbe noted that the withdrawal of Ugandan troops has\r\nbegun and that a joint peacemaking programme has\r\nbeen set up in the Ituri region.\r\nThe successful implementation of the Pretoria\r\nand Luanda Agreements, in particular with respect to\r\nthe withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops, will\r\nhave a clear impact on the conclusion of a\r\ncomprehensive and inclusive agreement in the context\r\nof the domestic political process aimed at national\r\nreconciliation and the reunification of the territory of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a view to\r\nthe prompt holding of free, democratic and transparent\r\nelections at all levels.\r\nFollowing consultations with various political\r\nand social groups, as well as with the Special Envoy of\r\nthe Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, my Government suggested that\r\narrangements for the signing of an inclusive agreement\r\ncould begin at an early date.\r\nI would like now to turn to the particular and\r\nworrying situation that prevails in the eastern part of\r\nmy country. I am referring to the bloody and\r\ndistressing events that took place in Kisangani and\r\nBunia; the resumed fighting in the Kivu region; the\r\nrapes; the plundering of the wealth of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo; and all the other human rights\r\nviolations that have taken place. I also have in mind the\r\nappalling destruction of fauna, flora and the ecosystem\r\nin general in the eastern part of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nI urgently appeal to the international community\r\nto put an end to this tragic situation, which is afflicting\r\nthe people of the eastern part of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, and to ensure that the\r\nperpetrators of these vile and barbaric acts are punished\r\nand brought to justice.\r\nLikewise, we look forward eagerly to the\r\nconclusions of the Panel of Experts, which we hope\r\nwill be accompanied by proposals for sanctions to be\r\nimposed on those who are plundering the resources of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is the\r\nbleak situation that has been prevailing in my country\r\nfor more than four years; the socio-economic situation\r\nof the people has deteriorated as a result of the war,\r\nwhich has deprived my Government of more than half\r\nof its resources. In order to deal with this economic\r\ndisaster and to alleviate the suffering of our people as\r\nmuch as possible, a number of measures been in place\r\nfor more than a year. The tangible effects of these\r\npositive measures include the stabilization of our\r\ncurrency and of the price of major consumer goods, as\r\nwell as the resumption of cooperation with\r\ninternational financial institutions.\r\nIn the same spirit, a large-scale national\r\nreconstruction programme is under way, aimed at the\r\nrehabilitation of the basic social infrastructure so as to\r\npromote the recovery of the economy and the process\r\nof development.\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nI have condemned the terrorism and the tragic\r\nevents of 11 September 2001, which plunged the\r\nAmerican people and all of humankind into mourning.\r\nI have provided an updated review of the peace process\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular\r\nwith regard to the Pretoria and Luanda Agreements. I\r\nhave expressed my grave concern about the disturbing\r\nhumanitarian situation prevailing in the eastern part of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is\r\ncharacterized by massacres and massive violations of\r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law. I\r\nhave also pointed to the particularly difficult socio-\r\neconomic situation affecting the population of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, noting that it has\r\nbeen aggravated by war and its adverse effects. If the\r\nwar persists, the Government’s efforts to achieve\r\neconomic recovery may well be completely nullified.\r\nIn order to put an end to this protracted tragedy, I\r\nearnestly appeal, through this Assembly, to the entire\r\ninternational community, to mobilize and become more\r\ndeeply involved in the quest for solutions to bring\r\nabout the reunification of our national territory and to\r\nreturn peace and stability to my country and to the\r\nwhole of the Great Lakes region.\r\nI would like to make several specific points. First,\r\nI believe that a conference should be held, under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations, on peace, security and\r\ndevelopment in the Great Lakes region. My country’s\r\ndesire, in keeping with its African tradition, has always\r\nbeen to live in peace and harmony with all the States of\r\nAfrica and of the world, beginning with its neighbours.\r\nSecondly, the international community should be\r\nmore actively involved in resolving the conflict that is\r\ntearing the Democratic Republic of the Congo apart. It\r\nis clear today that the international community seems\r\nto be forgetting the role played by Africa in the\r\ndevelopment of today’s wealthy States, and is showing\r\na degree of indifference to African issues.\r\nThirdly, the large number of Security Council\r\nresolutions which have, to date, remained\r\nunimplemented.\r\nFourthly, I am thinking of technical contributions\r\nand the mobilization of the international community to\r\nrehabilitate our ecosystem, so as to preserve this\r\nheritage of humankind.\r\nThe founding fathers of our universal\r\nOrganization, who were convinced that nations could\r\nbe brought together only through peaceful settlements\r\nof conflict, signed the Charter in order to ensure that no\r\narmed conflict would be a matter of indifference to the\r\nremainder of humanity. For this reason, the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, which believes deeply in the\r\nuniversal values championed by the United Nations,\r\nexpresses the hope that all the organs of the United\r\nNations will play their role to the fullest to ensure that\r\nwe may silence weapons wherever they are being used,\r\nin order to make peace a genuine right within the grasp\r\nof all of us.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMajor-General Joseph Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President\r\nof the Republic of Zambia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mwanawasa: Let me begin by\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\nPresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly. My delegation is confident that, given your\r\nvast political skills, you will execute your\r\nresponsibility as President of the fifty-seventh session\r\nof the United Nations General Assembly most\r\nhonourably.\r\nMy delegation pledges its total support and\r\ncooperation to you in the discharge of your important\r\nresponsibilities. You can depend on Zambia’s support\r\nand cooperation.\r\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo\r\nof the Republic of Korea, for the excellent manner in\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nwhich he presided over the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nUnited Nations General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation also congratulates the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for the able\r\nmanner in which he has steered the work of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe are happy to welcome Switzerland and East\r\nTimor as new Members of the United Nations family.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to working closely with\r\nthe two new Member States.\r\nThree days ago, the world commemorated the 1st\r\nanniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.\r\nThe past year has witnessed a global resolve to fight\r\ninternational terrorism. My Government wishes to join\r\nthe host country in remembering the tragic events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001.\r\nMy delegation salutes the efforts of the United\r\nNations in ensuring that there is peace in the world. I\r\nam pleased to note that there are signs of positive\r\ndevelopments in most of the trouble spots where there\r\nhave been conflicts.\r\nThe African Union and the international\r\ncommunity have to work together as partners in\r\nconflict prevention and peace-building. In the past\r\nforty years, Africa has lost too much blood through\r\nconflicts. Zambia is ready and willing to play her part\r\nto create in Africa a culture of respect for the rule of\r\nlaw and human rights, social and economic\r\ndevelopment, and to promote peace and security. In\r\nthis regard we welcome the positive signs towards\r\npeace in Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo and other conflict areas in Africa.\r\nThe search for peace is a continuous process. I\r\ntherefore appeal to the international community to\r\ncontinue extending assistance to bring about peace in\r\nthe conflict areas around the world.\r\nIt is against this background that my Government\r\nwelcomes the implementation of the Lusaka Peace\r\nProtocol in Angola and the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo. Since the death of Dr. Jonas Savimbi, the\r\nformer UNITA rebel leader, in February 2002, the\r\nprospects for peace in that country and the entire\r\nsubregion are encouraging.\r\nThe ceasefire agreement, signed between the\r\nAngolan Government and the UNITA military, further\r\npaved way for the implementation of the Lusaka Peace\r\nProtocol of November 1994.\r\nThe full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol is\r\nvital for the reintegration of Angola in the Southern\r\nAfrican economy and the promotion of regional peace\r\nand stability. The people of Angola require the moral\r\nand material support of the international community to\r\ncomplete that process.\r\nI would like also to express my country’s\r\nappreciation to the United Nations Security Council for\r\nthe measures being undertaken to strengthen the United\r\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Congo (MONUC). I am further gratified\r\nthat the efforts by His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire,\r\nformer President of Botswana, to promote internal\r\npolitical dialogue are bearing fruit. I also wish to note,\r\nwith appreciation, that the number of foreign troops\r\nstill on Democratic Republic of Congo soil has been\r\nsignificantly reduced.\r\nConflicts have a negative impact on the economic\r\nlife of the region. To Zambia, as a host to refugees\r\nfrom Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nand other parts of the continent, the recent signs of\r\npeace are significantly important. My Government\r\nhopes that these positive signs will result in the\r\nvoluntary repatriation of refugees to their countries.\r\nCurrently, there are 270,000 refugees in designated\r\ncamps and about 120,000 others who are\r\nsimultaneously settled in the border areas among the\r\nlocal people in Zambia. My Government will continue\r\nto require the material and financial support of the\r\ninternational community to help in the refugee\r\nmanagement effort.\r\nSince the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly\r\nof the former Organization of African Unity, held in\r\nLusaka in July 2001, Africa has continued to refine its\r\npartnerships with the rest of the world to foster\r\ndevelopment. The vehicle for this effort is the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). I wish\r\nto convey my Government’s appreciation to the leaders\r\nof the Group of 8 for endorsing the NEPAD programme\r\nduring their annual meeting, held in Kananaskis,\r\nCanada, on 27 June 2002. I note with appreciation that\r\nthe G8 countries considered positively the request by\r\nthe four-nation African representatives of Algeria,\r\nNigeria, Senegal and South Africa, that they earmark\r\nfor Africa 50 per cent of their projected foreign aid\r\nincreases in the coming years. I wish to thank the\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nEuropean Union, which has supported the NEPAD\r\nprogramme and remains committed to its pledge of\r\nsupport for the initiative.\r\nThe past year has seen practical and positive\r\ndevelopments in the response of the cooperating\r\npartners to African trade liberalization initiatives. In\r\nthis regard, I wish to take this opportunity to welcome\r\nthe initiative of the United States Government to refine\r\nthe scope of the African Growth and Opportunity Act\r\nto increase the number of products eligible to be\r\nexported to the United States.\r\nIn the health sector, Africa is experiencing the\r\ncatastrophic impact of a combination of the HIV/AIDS\r\npandemic and a series of outbreaks of such diseases as\r\nmalaria, tuberculosis and diarrhoea. Unfortunately, my\r\ncountry is one of those hard hit in this regard. Although\r\nmy Government has implemented health reforms that\r\nfocus on ameliorating the situation, far more resources\r\nare required to address the problem.\r\nMy Government has taken a decision to acquire\r\naffordable antiretroviral drugs for distribution to\r\npeople affected with AIDS. My delegation wishes to\r\nexpress its gratitude to our cooperating partners, who\r\nhave been forthcoming in providing resources for this\r\neffort. Early deaths from HIV/AIDS-related illnesses\r\nare robbing the country of skilled professionals and\r\ncreating large numbers of orphaned children.\r\nAs members are aware, a combination of natural\r\nand other factors has caused a food shortage and crisis\r\nin the southern African subregion. In response to this\r\nimpending catastrophe, on 18 July 2002 the United\r\nNations World Food Programme launched an appeal for\r\nfood aid in support of the affected areas. In response to\r\nthe food shortage, a number of countries and\r\ninternational organizations have pledged their support.\r\nMy delegation pays tribute to the United Nations and\r\nother cooperating partners in providing assistance to\r\nZambia to mitigate the food shortfall.\r\nHowever, it has come to the Government’s\r\nattention that some of the food aid products offered to\r\nZambia constituted genetically modified organisms\r\n(GMOs). The offer of genetically modified foods has\r\ncreated a difficult situation for the Government. While,\r\non the one hand, we are determined to procure food\r\nand seed for the mostly rural population that is hardest\r\nhit by the food shortage, we have expressed concern\r\nover the true impact of GMOs on our people and soil.\r\nDue to our low scientific and technological base,\r\nGovernment has opted for the procurement of non-\r\nGMO food products. It is not my Government’s\r\nintention to sacrifice the lives of the Zambian people\r\nby taking this position. However, given the lack of and\r\noften conflicting international information on the\r\npossible effects of genetically modified products on\r\nhumans, I therefore wish to request Members’\r\nunderstanding of Zambia’s position on GMOs. In this\r\nregard, my Government has accepted an offer from the\r\nUnited States Government for Zambian scientists to\r\nvisit America to study first-hand the GMO factor. Their\r\nfindings will help us to map out a way forward and to\r\nmake informed decisions and choices.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-seventh session successful deliberations of the\r\nissues before it. I wish to appeal to all Member States\r\nto ensure the rapid implementation of decisions\r\nemanating therefrom.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Zambia for his statement.\r\nMr. Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince ‘Ulukalala\r\nLavaka Ata, Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Tonga\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince ‘Ulukalala Lavaka\r\nAta, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Tonga, was escorted to\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Royal Highness Prince ‘Ulukalala\r\nLavaka Ata, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Tonga, and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nPrince ‘Ulukalala Lavaka Ata (Tonga): As I\r\noffer you my congratulations upon your assumption of\r\nyour high office, Mr. President, I must also praise your\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for a\r\ntruly exemplary term as President, which was marked\r\nat the outset by the Nobel Peace Prize for the\r\nOrganization and which closed with the promise of the\r\nrecently concluded World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. Together with the continuing leadership\r\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the support of the\r\nOrganization’s Member States, I look forward to that\r\ntradition of excellence and achievement continuing\r\nunder your presidency, Sir.\r\nI add my voice to the chorus within this\r\nAssembly warmly welcoming the Swiss Confederation\r\nto our fold and congratulating East Timor on its\r\nforthcoming accession to membership. Tonga very\r\nmuch looks forward to working with both of them as\r\nfully-fledged States Members of the Organization.\r\nWhile 11 September 2001 will for all of us be\r\never present, it is fitting that we pause to remember\r\nthose who fell in the line of duty and those other loved\r\nones who perished on that terrible day. Those horrific\r\nevents should serve to inspire us to rededicate\r\nourselves and galvanize our collective efforts to fight\r\nthe scourge of terrorism in all its forms and\r\nmanifestations.\r\nMy Government continues to formulate measures\r\nin compliance with Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001). These measures have both national and\r\nregional dimensions, and a number of workshops have\r\nbeen held in the Pacific region during the year to\r\nensure that Pacific island countries formulate viable\r\ncounter-terrorism measures and to assist them to do so.\r\nA number of key Government agencies, including civil\r\naviation, immigration, police, finance and customs\r\nagencies, have already adopted measures, including\r\nfinancial and rapid reaction security measures, to\r\ntighten the security aspect of the resolution. Obviously,\r\nthe sustained assistance of developed countries in our\r\nregion has been very useful in our endeavours. It is our\r\nearnest hope that our required country report will be\r\nbefore the Counter-Terrorism Committee by the year’s\r\nend. In this respect, I am grateful to the Committee and\r\nto the Security Council for their patience.\r\nSince I last addressed this Assembly, at the\r\nMillennium Summit, there have been further signposts\r\nto add to the developmental path. These are signposts\r\nso readily identifiable as Doha, Monterrey and, now,\r\nJohannesburg. These names epitomize the vision and\r\nthe as yet unfulfilled promise of our collective\r\ndevelopment aspirations in this era of globalization. In\r\nthat regard, I commend President Fox and the people of\r\nMexico for their sterling efforts earlier this year. It was\r\npleasing that consensus prevailed on critical thematic\r\nissues of particular import to developing countries, and\r\nwe look forward to the opportunities that Monterrey\r\nwill afford. I further commend President Mbeki and the\r\npeople of South Africa for their wonderful achievement\r\nearlier this month. I am particularly pleased that the\r\nJohannesburg Summit gave prominence and profile in\r\nthe Plan of Implementation to the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing States. In that\r\nregard, Tonga looks forward to the 10-year review of\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action in 2004 as a further\r\nsignpost in the developmental path that will give\r\nimpetus to what was achieved in Johannesburg. In\r\npreparing for that review, Tonga will continue its\r\nnational efforts to refine and identify areas for specific\r\npriority capacity-building needs, as well as\r\nopportunities to take increased advantage of financial\r\nand technological support.\r\nAs a developing ocean State, we are encouraged\r\nby the particular commitments in the Johannesburg\r\nPlan of Implementation on fish stocks and fishing\r\npractices. The implementation of those time-bound\r\ncommitments requires responsibility and good faith\r\nfrom all parties so as to ensure that States like mine\r\nobtain their fair share of their vastest and most\r\nbountiful resource. We are pleased that the United\r\nNations fish stocks Agreement has entered into force\r\nand welcome the informal meeting of States parties\r\nthat took place here in New York recently. In this\r\nrespect, we urge other Member States to become party\r\nto that important Agreement. Within this context, we\r\nalso continue to welcome the preparations under way\r\nfor giving effect to the Convention on the Conservation\r\nand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in\r\nthe Western and Central Pacific Ocean. The\r\nConvention is a testament to our commitment to\r\nconserving and sustainably managing a critically\r\nimportant resource. As such, we continue to urge the\r\ndistant water fishing nations with a real fisheries\r\ninterest in our region to make every effort to become a\r\nparty to the Convention. Tonga continues to value the\r\nwork and decisions taken this year of the Meeting of\r\nStates Parties to the United Convention on the Law of\r\nthe Sea, the International Seabed Authority and the\r\nthird meeting of the United Nations Open-ended\r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law\r\nof the Sea. We look forward to an important milestone\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nlater this year: the twentieth anniversary of the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I hope that\r\nMember States will consider the upcoming anniversary\r\nas an opportune time to become a party to the\r\nConvention.\r\nOur region has further endorsed a first-ever\r\nregional oceans policy that elaborates some guiding\r\nprinciples that should serve as a template for countries\r\nlike Tonga to consider using to developing national\r\nocean policies that strengthen coordination and\r\ncomplementarity in our ocean-related activities. One\r\nactivity that continues to give rise to deep concern is\r\nthe transshipment of radioactive material through the\r\nwaters of our region. In this regard, while we might\r\nunderstand the needs and requirements of those States\r\nthat engage in this activity, it is just as important that\r\nthe necessary framework for prior notice, consent,\r\nsafety and compensation for countries like Tonga not\r\nbe ignored.\r\nTonga continues to support the development of an\r\nappropriate environmental vulnerability index for small\r\nisland developing States and commends the continuing\r\nwork of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience\r\nCommission in that regard. It is our belief that, with\r\nthe participation of States, such an index has the\r\npotential to provide accurate indicators of vulnerability\r\nto which small islands in particular are exposed, such\r\nas natural disasters, climate change and sea level rise.\r\nAs such, Tonga welcomes the commitment by certain\r\nAnnex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol made\r\nduring the Johannesburg Summit to ratify the Protocol\r\nand the further opportunities for progress that such\r\npositive action presents.\r\nOn 30 and 31 December 2001, tropical cyclone\r\nWaka traversed the northern group of Tonga with a\r\nwind velocity in excess of 100 miles an hour and\r\nresulted in substantial and horrific damage to those\r\nislands. To be sure, the damage was estimated at over\r\n140 million Tongan dollars, but thankfully there was no\r\nloss of life. The inevitable and difficult task of relief,\r\nrecovery and reconstruction was compounded by the\r\ngeographic distance from the capital of the northern\r\ngroup and the sheer scale of the damage sustained.\r\nLuckily, action by traditional donor Governments and\r\nour neighbours within the region, territorial\r\ngovernments, regional and international organizations,\r\nsuch as the Pacific Islands Forum and specific United\r\nNations agencies, was swift and generous and provided\r\nmuch-needed assistance to my Government. I am\r\ndeeply grateful to those Governments, organizations\r\nand agencies, as well as to non-governmental\r\norganizations and churches, for their valued assistance\r\nin our time of crisis. Two weeks after the cyclone,\r\nnature, having wrought such devastating winds, caused\r\nmore favourable weather to prevail, which greatly\r\nhelped the replanting phases of recovery. We expect a\r\nresurgence of the critical agricultural, tourism and\r\nfisheries sectors by the end of the year.\r\nWhile information and communications\r\ntechnology (ICT) remains the way to go, we continue\r\nwith our own efforts to bridge the digital divide and\r\ntake maximum advantage of the digital revolution. To\r\ndo so will require joint efforts in tandem with the\r\ninternational community and the United Nations,\r\nparticularly through the efforts of the United Nations\r\nICT Task Force as one avenue. Such efforts must be\r\ncharacterized by partnership and inclusion in the ICT\r\nprocess, so that all developing States in every region\r\ncan benefit. The United Nations role of bridging,\r\ncoordinating and integrating activities is therefore\r\ncrucial. In that respect, we urge continued support for\r\nthe Small Island Developing States Information\r\nNetwork (SIDSNet) and for efforts to strengthen its\r\ncapacity to support and assist small island developing\r\nStates.\r\nWe welcome the fruitful outcome earlier this year\r\nof the General Assembly special session on children.\r\nWhile we recognize the promise it holds for the welfare\r\nand well-being of all children, like the outcome of the\r\nrecent special session on HIV/AIDS, commitments\r\nmust progress beyond rhetoric into concrete action.\r\nTonga fully supports the work of the Security\r\nCouncil and, like other speakers before me, calls for\r\nthe full implementation of all of its resolutions to\r\nensure an enduring peace in arenas of conflict and to\r\nlift the veil of doubt where such doubt could lead to\r\nconflict.\r\nIn one such arena, we join the call for an end to\r\nviolence, a return to the negotiating table and the\r\nbuilding of confidence so as to realize the coexistence\r\nof two States, side by side in secure and recognized\r\nborders.\r\nTonga also supports efforts to streamline the work\r\nof the General Assembly so that it can play the pivotal\r\nand focused role we desire. In like terms, we support\r\nthe call for reform of the Security Council, in which\r\nthe number of both permanent and non-permanent seats\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nwould be increased to accord with and respond to\r\ntoday’s realities.\r\nFinally, with respect to pertinent regional issues,\r\nTonga endorses the views expressed in both the Nadi\r\nDeclaration, contained in document A/56/1015, and the\r\nSuva Communiqué, that will be contained in document\r\nA/57/331. They are the respective outcomes of the\r\nthird Summit of the African, Caribbean and Pacific\r\nHeads of State and Government, held in Nadi, Fiji, in\r\nJuly 2002, and of the annual meeting of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum Leaders held in Suva, Fiji, in August\r\n2002.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Tonga\r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince ‘Ulukalala Lavaka\r\nAta, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Tonga, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Kassymzhomart K. Tokaev, Secretary of State and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nKazakhstan.\r\nMr. Tokaev (Kazakhstan): Allow me first to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the high\r\noffice of the presidency of the current session and to\r\nexpress confidence that, under your able leadership, the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be\r\nsuccessful and fruitful.\r\nThe terrorist acts in the United States, the\r\nanniversary of which we have just marked with great\r\nsorrow, prompted all mankind to pay close attention to\r\nthe fundamental issues of sustainable development.\r\nThe barbaric acts of international terrorists\r\ndemonstrated very convincingly the fragility of the\r\nworld we live in and the importance for all States to\r\njoin their efforts to ensure economic development and\r\ncivil rights, security and stability.\r\nThe contemporary world, with all the diversity of\r\nits political and economic systems, requires, as never\r\nbefore, agreed and coordinated efforts by the\r\ncommunity of nations to protect common human\r\nvalues, primarily the rights of all citizens to a decent\r\nlife.\r\nHas mankind been able to rid itself of its own\r\nentrenched flaws — poverty, environmental pollution,\r\ndisease and crime? The answer is more than evident:\r\nthe community of nations has not made progress in\r\nresolving those issues. Thus, breeding grounds have\r\nbeen created for the spread of such dangerous\r\nphenomena as terrorism and drug trafficking, religious\r\nextremism and the illegal arms trade. Having crossed\r\nthe threshold of the new millennium, mankind has been\r\nforced to exert efforts to resolve centuries-old issues\r\nand to counter new threats.\r\nThe events that took place last year have changed\r\nthe world and have prompted everybody to think hard\r\nabout the foundations that support it. The community\r\nof nations faces a pressing task: to create a new\r\narchitecture of global security based on a multi-polar\r\nworld, and to set up effective mechanisms to overcome\r\nthe obstacles to modern economic and political\r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn our view, under these circumstances, the role\r\nand the responsibility of international institutions,\r\nprimarily the United Nations, become significantly\r\ngreater. Strengthening the authority of the United\r\nNations is our common responsibility. We believe that\r\nthe existing system of adopting decisions affecting the\r\nfundamental interests of mankind should never be\r\ndoubted, let alone reshaped in any way. The issues of\r\nthe world and peace should be considered and\r\ndecisions reflecting the will and the interests of the\r\ncommunity of nations should be adopted only within\r\nthe framework of the United Nations.\r\nGrounds for the use of force against Member\r\nStates should be irrefutable evidence, corroborated by\r\ninternational institutions, of their illegal action to\r\ndisrupt the world order and to undermine global and\r\nregional security.\r\nThe changed world forces us to take a fresh look\r\nat disarmament issues, primarily the consolidation of\r\nthe non-proliferation regime. It is becoming more and\r\nmore evident that, under these new conditions, the\r\ncommunity of nations should focus its main efforts on\r\npreventing terrorists from getting hold of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. Therefore, joint action by Member\r\nStates to continue to consolidate the non-proliferation\r\nregime and to make it universal deserve special\r\nattention. We believe that the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which binds\r\nits participants to take nuclear disarmament measures,\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nshould continue to play an important role in the area of\r\nnuclear arms control.\r\nAs one of the few States in the world that have\r\nvoluntarily relinquished their nuclear heritage, we\r\nbelieve that a prerequisite for an atmosphere of trust in\r\ncontemporary international relations is the early entry\r\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty (CTBT).\r\nBecause it attaches great significance to the\r\npreservation of peace and security in Central Asia,\r\nKazakhstan is interested in signing, as soon as\r\npossible, a treaty creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone\r\nin the region. Such a zone could be an important\r\ncontribution by regional States to the disarmament and\r\narms control efforts of international community.\r\nFurther, additional results-oriented efforts to\r\nprevent the excessive accumulation of and illegal\r\ntrafficking in small arms are no less important. It is\r\nimpossible to ignore the alarming fact that 55 per cent\r\nof known small arms stocks, equivalent to 305 million\r\npieces, are now already in private hands. In view of the\r\nneed for targeted actions in this area, we express our\r\nwillingness to host in Kazakhstan, in 2003, an\r\ninternational conference on this subject under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations.\r\nOur country, home to the Baikonur space\r\nlaunching pad, is well aware of the harmful effects of\r\nthe militarization of outer space. Therefore, we believe\r\nthat it is imperative to start, without delay, talks to\r\nprevent an arms race in outer space.\r\nFrom the very start, Kazakhstan has resolutely\r\nand unconditionally supported counter-terrorist actions\r\nby the international coalition. Without any doubt, its\r\neffective measures have contributed to the settlement\r\nof the situation in Afghanistan.\r\nTogether with all interested States and parties,\r\nour country supports the key role of the United Nations\r\nin the post-conflict peace-building in Afghanistan. We\r\nintend to take a most active part in implementing an\r\ninternational aid programme for Afghanistan.\r\nKazakhstan is cooperating successfully with the World\r\nFood Programme by using it to send its agricultural\r\nproducts to Afghanistan. Our country has provided the\r\nAfghan people with free humanitarian aid in the form\r\nof grain. We believe that early implementation of the\r\ndecisions adopted at the Tokyo Conference will\r\ncontribute to the successful solution of the Afghan\r\nproblem and to the eradication of international\r\nterrorism.\r\nWhen we speak about Afghanistan, we cannot\r\nignore the issue of drug trafficking. Unfortunately, that\r\nlong-suffering country continues to be a main source of\r\nthe proliferation of drugs that are being transported\r\nthrough the territories of the Central Asian States and\r\nsold on the world markets, first of all in Europe. This\r\nproblem is getting more and more dangerous and\r\nrequires urgent and effective measures by the\r\ncommunity of nations. We hope that the coordinating\r\nrole of the United Nations International Drug Control\r\nProgramme will be strengthened. One has to realize\r\nthat it is the drug trafficking that constitutes a financial\r\nbasis of international terrorism. When we put up a just\r\nfight against that evil, we, unfortunately, fight its\r\nmanifestations and do not pay due attention to the root\r\ncause of the phenomenon. If this state of affairs\r\nremains unchanged, curbing international terrorism\r\nwill turn into an indefinite process that will exhaust all\r\nfinancial and political resources of the community of\r\nnations.\r\nThe world community is closely watching the\r\ndevelopment of the situation in the Middle East.\r\nInterested States quite justifiably express their concern\r\nover the deteriorating chances of a peaceful settlement.\r\nWe support the need to convene as soon as possible an\r\ninternational conference on the Middle East settlement\r\nin order to take parallel steps: to strengthen Israel’s\r\nsecurity, to strengthen Palestinian economic and\r\npolitical institutions and to settle the details of the final\r\npeace agreement. The international community also has\r\nto intensify its efforts to curb terrorism and meet the\r\nhumanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.\r\nSince the first days of its independence,\r\nKazakhstan has focussed its foreign affairs efforts on\r\nthe creation of a security system in Asia. That goal was\r\nadvanced by the first summit meeting of the\r\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-Building\r\nMeasures in Asia (CICA), convened in June of this\r\nyear in Almaty. For the first time ever, the heads of the\r\nmajor Asian States came together to express their\r\npolitical will and interest in a joint search for ways to\r\nstrengthen peace and stability in the Asian region.\r\nThe adoption at the summit meeting of the final\r\ndocuments, the Almaty Act on the institutionalization\r\nof the CICA and the Declaration on Eliminating\r\nTerrorism and Promoting Dialogue among\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nCivilizations, has had an extraordinary significance.\r\nFor the first time ever, the Asian continent has adopted\r\ndocuments making a significant contribution to\r\nregional and global security. Expressing our\r\nappreciation to the CICA member States for their\r\nefficient work at the summit meeting, we call on all\r\ninterested States to continue their work to implement\r\nconfidence-building measures in Asia.\r\nWe in Kazakhstan believe that the Shanghai\r\nCooperation Organization can become an effective tool\r\nin ensuring security and stability in the region. The\r\nmain mission of that organization is to address jointly\r\nthe problems of security, as well as to create effective\r\nmechanisms for trade, economic and humanitarian\r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Johannesburg Summit fully highlighted the\r\nimportant need to overcome the antagonisms of modern\r\neconomic and political development. It has become\r\nevident that with increasing globalization, the\r\ncommunity of nations will have to pay close attention\r\nto the search for ways to ensure a more harmonious\r\ndivision of profits and benefits between the rich and\r\npoor among mankind. Addressing the forum in South\r\nAfrica, the President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan\r\nNazarbaev, rightly observed that without the natural\r\nand human resources of the developing countries the\r\nrich States would have never become rich.\r\nIt is commonly recognized that sustainable\r\ndevelopment is the only way to ensure the survival of\r\nmankind. Therefore, Kazakhstan supports targeted and\r\ncoordinated efforts by the international community to\r\nsolve burning economic, social and environmental\r\nproblems of the Central Asian region. We attach great\r\nsignificance to cooperation with the United Nations in\r\nwater resources management, rehabilitation of the\r\nenvironmental disaster areas in the Semipalatinsk\r\nregion and the Aral Sea, the preservation of\r\nbiodiversity and the prevention of soil degradation and\r\ndesertification. At the same time, Kazakhstan has every\r\nright to expect more effective actions in this field on\r\nthe part of the United Nations. Unfortunately, our\r\ncountry, as well as other regional States, have yet to\r\nreceive assistance that would speed up the solution of\r\nthe environmental problems.\r\nKazakhstan is interested in strengthening fruitful\r\ncooperation with the United Nations to improve\r\nregional transportation infrastructure, including within\r\nthe United Nations Special Programme for the\r\nEconomies of Central Asia (SPECA).\r\nKazakhstan is actively cooperating with its\r\nEurasian Economic Community partners and considers\r\nthat integration organization to be a very promising\r\nstructure in terms of creating a common economic\r\nspace for an extensive stretch of the Eurasian\r\ncontinent.\r\nOur country stands for a more effective Economic\r\nCooperation Organization (ECO) and for making its\r\nactivities more goal-oriented. We express our hope that\r\nthe upcoming Istanbul summit will become a milestone\r\nin ECO’s activities.\r\nThe diplomatic efforts of Kazakhstan are also\r\naimed at further strengthening political cooperation,\r\ntrade and economic ties with the Central Asian States.\r\nWe believe that a recently created new organization,\r\nthe Central Asian Union, has an important role to play\r\nin this regard.\r\nThe legal status of the Caspian Sea is becoming\r\nan increasingly important problem within the context\r\nof current international relations. The lack of consensus\r\namong the five Caspian States on the legal status of\r\nthis unique water basin seriously hampers the chances\r\nof turning the Caspian Sea into a zone of peace and\r\ngenuine cooperation. The issues of unrestricted\r\nnavigation, the protection of biodiversity and the\r\nenvironment, as well as demilitarization, remain very\r\nmuch on the agenda. Kazakhstan has consistently\r\ncalled for the continuation of the preparatory work for\r\na multilateral convention based on the consensus\r\namong the five Caspian States in order to develop\r\nsecure legal safeguards providing for long-term and\r\nstable cooperation and for creating favourable\r\nconditions for attracting investments to develop the\r\nmineral resources of the Caspian Sea.\r\nIn this regard, Kazakhstan attaches great\r\nsignificance to an agreement with Russia on the\r\ndelimitation of the seabed in the northern part of the\r\nCaspian Sea in order to ensure the rights of the users of\r\nthe seabed subsoil, as well as to the protocol on the\r\nmodified median line in this part of the sea signed in\r\nJune of this year.\r\nWe believe that the signing of these documents\r\nrepresents a breakthrough in the protracted process of\r\nthe development of the legal status of the Caspian Sea.\r\nThese important agreements give the green light to\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nforeign investments in the development of the\r\nenormous mineral resources of Kazakhstan’s sector of\r\nthe sea. This will allow our country to join the group of\r\nleading world producers of hydrocarbons. We intend to\r\ncontinue our cooperation with international financial\r\ninstitutions and companies, thereby ensuring a\r\nfavourable investment climate in Kazakhstan.\r\nKazakhstan has assumed obligations with regard\r\nto the observation and protection of fundamental\r\nhuman rights and freedoms. Our country is a\r\nparticipant in major international human rights\r\nconventions and exerts every effort to implement them.\r\nDemocracy and human rights are part and parcel\r\nof political life in Kazakhstan, which has undertaken,\r\nin complex geopolitical conditions, reforms aimed at\r\nthe liberalization of the economy and at the creation of\r\na civil society. These reforms are unprecedented for a\r\npost-Soviet State.\r\nThe question of human rights, in the view of our\r\ncountry, should be on the agenda of inter-State\r\ncooperation. At the same time, we believe that unified\r\nstandards and criteria should be used in assessing the\r\nhuman rights situation in a particular country. We\r\nbelieve that the prerogative and responsibility for the\r\nconsideration of the state of affairs in this very\r\nsensitive area should rest with the United Nations. We\r\nare pinning great hopes on the activities of the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, there is\r\nno alternative to multilateral cooperation. Only jointly\r\ncan we work successfully for a world without wars and\r\nconflicts, a world based on justice and prosperity.\r\nWe have embraced with great enthusiasm the\r\nstatement made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, and express our support for his concept of\r\njoining efforts in order to address the key issues of\r\nmodern times.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nThe Right Honourable Jack Straw, Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMr. Straw (United Kingdom): In an imperfect\r\nworld, our citizens need the United Nations as they\r\nhave never needed it before. The United Nations has\r\nnot resolved all conflicts by peaceful means, nor could\r\nit. The authority of the United Nations has to be\r\nunderpinned by the force of arms. But the remarkable\r\nachievement of this body has been to make the fine\r\nlanguage of its Charter a force for good beyond just\r\nwords; by this the United Nations has raised the bar\r\nagainst the illegitimate use of violence, by States and\r\nnow by terrorists. In doing so, the United Nations has\r\nsaved lives by the million and saved millions more\r\nfrom fear, poverty and tyranny.\r\nWithout the United Nations, there could have\r\nbeen no salvation for the people of East Timor, no\r\nprospect of lasting peace in Sierra Leone, no one to\r\nhelp rebuild Afghanistan. Forty years ago, President\r\nJohn F. Kennedy predicted a world in which 25 States\r\nwould have nuclear weapons. But the Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty, supported by international\r\nsafeguards, has ensured that this nightmare scenario\r\nhas failed to materialize.\r\nAll this should serve to remind us of the critical\r\nrole which the United Nations has to play in world\r\naffairs, under its excellent Secretary-General, Kofi\r\nAnnan. It is the responsibility of all of us here in the\r\nAssembly to ensure that the legitimacy, the authority\r\nand the capacity of the United Nations to preserve\r\npeace and to help build prosperity is strengthened and\r\nnot undermined.\r\nToday, alongside the traditional threats to global\r\npeace and security, the United Nations and the world\r\ncommunity face three rising challenges: failing States,\r\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe world saw in Afghanistan the graphic\r\ndangers of State failure, where order breaks down, law\r\nis undermined and anarchy takes over. We in the\r\ninternational community must accept our share of the\r\nblame for allowing that country to disintegrate. Al\r\nQaeda and their evil creed were only too willing to take\r\nadvantage. But we delude ourselves if we believe that\r\nthe chaos in Afghanistan over much of the last decade\r\nis unique. In too many areas of the world, our fellow\r\ncitizens are forced to live under the rule of gangs,\r\nwithout the security and freedoms which we all should\r\nbe able to take for granted.\r\nIf we are serious about the concept of an\r\ninternational community, then, as Members of the\r\nUnited Nations, we must accept our responsibility to\r\nhelp prevent States from failing and to restore order\r\nwhere States have already collapsed.\r\nThe United Kingdom’s own experience in\r\nAfghanistan, as the International Security Assistance\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nForce (ISAF) lead nation, working with the United\r\nNations, shows what can be done; but we all know that\r\nmuch more needs to be done. We need a much more\r\nstructured and methodical approach to this growing\r\nproblem of failed and failing States.\r\nBut the tools are there. At Monterrey in March\r\nand at Johannesburg earlier this month, the world\r\ncommunity has built on the Millennium Development\r\nGoals to reduce poverty among the world’s most\r\ndisadvantaged people. We are backing this commitment\r\nwith action. Between 1996 and 2006 the United\r\nKingdom will have doubled its development assistance.\r\nTogether with the Doha Round of the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO), we have within our grasp a\r\nnew era of sustainable economic growth and prosperity,\r\na stable political future for the developing world and a\r\nmuch more secure global environment.\r\nBut people cannot be freed from poverty unless\r\nthey are also free from fear. Security is not an option; it\r\nis a necessity. Three years ago over half of Sierra\r\nLeone was under the control of rebels; over half the\r\npopulation was displaced; countless civilians had been\r\nmurdered, abducted or horribly mutilated; a spiral of\r\nsickness and hunger was taking over. Now, thanks to\r\nUnited Nations and British intervention to end that\r\ndecade-long civil war, people are returning home and\r\nrebuilding their shattered lives. But long-term\r\ncommitment is necessary in situations like that.\r\nAs we found in Afghanistan, when we deal with\r\nfailing States, we have to tackle the second challenge\r\nto international law and justice — that of global\r\nterrorism — as well.\r\nAll the nations of the world, and all its people —\r\nblack, white, Buddhist, Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu\r\nand Sikh — have a common interest in defeating\r\nterrorism. There must be no hiding places for terrorism\r\nor for terrorists; no hiding places for their money; and\r\nno semantic hiding places either. The distinction some\r\nclaim between terrorists and freedom-fighters is false\r\nand dangerous. Their victims enjoy no such distinction.\r\nThere must be no such distinctions either in\r\ninternational law.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) created\r\nnew obligations on all of us. The United Kingdom has\r\nbeen honoured to chair the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee. There has been an overwhelmingly\r\npositive response. But, as we recall those who lost their\r\nlives on 11 September last year, we cannot relax our\r\ncollective determination.\r\nAlongside the threats from failing States and\r\nfrom terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction poses the greatest current threat to global\r\nsecurity, and nowhere is the case for universal support\r\nfor the enforcement of United Nations law stronger\r\nthan in the field of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the\r\nBiological and Toxin Weapons Convention comprise\r\none of the world’s most significant bodies of\r\ninternational law. For the past three decades, this\r\ncorpus of law has ensured — with one infamous\r\nexception — that no States have resorted to these, the\r\nworld’s worst weapons.\r\nThat exception is Iraq. For two decades, Saddam\r\nHussein’s regime has defied and frustrated every\r\nattempt to enforce the international rule of law. Iraq is\r\nthe only country to be condemned by the United\r\nNations for breaching the Convention on Chemical\r\nWeapons. Iraq has fought wars of aggression against\r\ntwo neighbours, and has launched missile attacks\r\nagainst five countries in the region. Iraq has used\r\npoison gas against its own people. Saddam Hussein has\r\npersistently mocked the authority of the United\r\nNations. No country has deceived every other country\r\nin the world as systematically and cynically as Iraq.\r\nAnd no country presents as fundamental a challenge to\r\nthe United Nations as Iraq.\r\nEvery society, from the smallest village to the\r\nglobal community represented here in the General\r\nAssembly, must have rules, and every member of that\r\ncommunity must accept responsibility for respecting\r\nand maintaining those rules. Without this, the very\r\nconcept of community breaks down. So those of us\r\nwho believe in an active international community\r\ncannot stand by and do nothing while Iraq continues to\r\ndefy the will of the United Nations. All of us who\r\nbelieve in the United Nations have to make up our\r\nminds now about how to deal with Iraq. The authority\r\nof the United Nations itself is at stake.\r\nWe cannot let Iraq do grave damage to this\r\nOrganization and the international order which it\r\nrepresents. We cannot let Iraq go on defying a decade\r\nof Security Council resolutions. If we do, we will find\r\nthat our resolutions are dismissed by aggressors\r\neverywhere as mere words. We have spent 57 years\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nbuilding this Organization beyond a talking shop. We\r\ncannot now let that work be undone.\r\nThere are times when hard choices have to be\r\nmade. On Iraq, we have now reached such a moment. If\r\nwe fail to deal with this challenge, the United Nations\r\nitself will be seriously weakened. And that would make\r\nthe world a much more dangerous place.\r\nAs President Bush spelled out in his powerful\r\nspeech to the Assembly here on Thursday, we have to\r\nbe resolute in the face of Iraq’s defiance and secure the\r\nwill of the United Nations. We must require Iraq to re-\r\nadmit inspectors, with unfettered access. We have not\r\njust an interest but a responsibility to ensure that Iraq\r\ncomplies fully with international law. We have to be\r\nclear to Iraq and to ourselves about the consequences\r\nwhich will flow from a failure by Iraq to meet its\r\nobligations.\r\nAnd yes, in dealing with the threat posed by Iraq\r\nwe must also tackle those other international\r\nchallenges outlined so eloquently by Kofi Annan in his\r\naddress.\r\nOver the past year we have seen a further\r\ndeterioration in security in Israel and in the occupied\r\nterritories. There has never been a greater need for\r\ninternational involvement in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess to secure the outcome we all want to see: two\r\nStates, Israel and Palestine living side by side within\r\nsecure and recognized borders, based on Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\r\n(2002).\r\nIn Kashmir, we should continue to urge both\r\nIndia and Pakistan to act with restraint, and to seek to\r\nresolve that long-running conflict.\r\nAt the end of the cold war we had all hoped that\r\nfuture generations would be able to enjoy a world\r\nwhere cooperation rather than conflict was the\r\nhallmark of international affairs. That goal is still\r\nwithin reach, if we are united in tackling State failure,\r\nin the war against terrorism and in confronting those\r\nthreats of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe tasks facing the founders of this institution\r\nwere no less intimidating. Yet their combination of\r\nhigh values and hard-headed realism created the\r\ngreatest instrument in history for the avoidance of war.\r\nOur founders’ achievement has been formidable. But\r\nthe Organization now faces new and emerging threats.\r\nWe have to confront those threats and be ever alive to\r\nthe challenges which are out there to peace and justice\r\nacross the world. All of us who believe in those\r\nprinciples of international law and justice have a duty\r\nto ensure that they are both upheld and enforced.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mircea Geoana, Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs of Romania.\r\nMr. Geoana (Romania) (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme to begin, Sir, by congratulating you on your\r\nelection to preside over the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. My congratulations go likewise to\r\nthe outgoing president, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-\r\nsoo, for his dedication and for a job well done. I wish\r\nalso to echo earlier speakers in welcoming, very\r\nwarmly, Switzerland as the newest Member of the\r\nOrganization and Timor-Leste, which will be joining us\r\nshortly.\r\nGlobal security models, which are in a process of\r\nchange after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001,\r\nhave posed serious and unexpected challenges to the\r\ninternational community. We have been faced with\r\ntragic proof that our security is more fragile than we\r\nhad imagined and that democracy and freedom have\r\nbeen under attack. We have been violently reminded\r\nthat combating terrorism is a matter for us all.\r\nThe prompt and constructive response of my\r\ncountry, Romania, to the United Nations appeal for\r\nsolidarity has been very clear. Our participation in the\r\nInternational Assistance Force for Afghanistan,\r\napproved by the Romanian Parliament in December\r\n2001, clearly attests to our resolve to fulfil, in practice\r\nas well as in spirit, our commitment to the principles\r\nand purposes of the United Nations.\r\nFollowing the adoption by the Security Council\r\nof its resolution 1373 (2001), we enacted legislation to\r\nprevent, in Romania, the financing of terrorist\r\norganizations and acts, and we have ratified the 12\r\nUnited Nations conventions and protocols concerning\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe have been actively involved in operations in\r\nAfghanistan with our strategic allies and we are,\r\ntogether, tackling the consequences of the struggle\r\nagainst terrorism.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nBut have we, the international community, done\r\nenough? The Secretary-General, in his opening\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nstatement, drew an uncompromising picture of the\r\nthreats to peace, and rightly reminded us of our\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nRomania believes it is necessary to proceed\r\nunambiguously in condemning and actively combating\r\nall forms of terrorism and violent fanaticism through\r\ncooperation at the international level that is\r\nsubstantive, consistent and coherent. The financing of\r\nterrorism is an obvious target for action. Romania\r\nbelieves that the experience of regional liaison and\r\njoint operations in South-East Europe can be of use to\r\ninternational efforts to suppress the flow of funds to\r\nterrorist groups.\r\nThe terrorist threat calls for us to be even more\r\nvigilant in controlling the use and proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, as well as conventional\r\nweapons, such as landmines and small arms, which can\r\nfall — sometimes too often — into the wrong hands. In\r\nthis context, Romania calls on Iraq to comply with\r\nexisting Security Council resolutions and to allow\r\nUnited Nations inspectors to return, immediately and\r\nunconditionally, to enable further decisions to be taken\r\nrelevant to the people of Iraq and the security and\r\nstability of the area. Romania was on the Security\r\nCouncil in 1990 when the first resolutions on Iraq were\r\nadopted and contributed to building consensus at that\r\ntime. We believe that the Security Council must\r\nrespond to the continued defiance of its resolutions\r\nfirmly and resolutely. There can be no doubt as to my\r\nGovernment’s stand should fears about possible threats\r\nto global security prove justified. As we have done in\r\nthe past, we will stand alongside our allies and\r\nfreedom-loving nations in the defence of world peace.\r\nA strong response to Iraq’s long-term defiance of\r\nthe Security Council’s authority is also called for\r\nbecause of the threat to global security from weapons\r\nof mass destruction. The temptation to apply these\r\nsame principles to other, localized conflict situations\r\nshould be resisted, especially when mechanisms exist\r\nfor dialogue and peaceful resolution. While States have\r\nthe right to exercise control over their own security,\r\nthey also have a responsibility to ensure that security\r\nmeasures do not undermine the foundations of\r\ndemocracy. We can adapt to these new realities without\r\nsacrificing human rights and universal values. Indeed,\r\nthrough respect for civil liberties and the promotion of\r\nequal opportunity and social cohesion, we can help to\r\nremove some of the root causes of terrorism:\r\nresentment and frustration fuelled by poverty and\r\nmarginalization.\r\nThis is a fundamental element of conflict\r\nprevention, but early warning and early intervention by\r\nthe international community are not enough. The\r\nexperiences of the last decade show that it is time to\r\nmove away from ad hoc solutions for short-term\r\nproblems towards an integrated and long-term\r\napproach to nation-building. By “integrated”, I mean\r\nthat the international response should be based on an\r\nefficient division of labour between the appropriate\r\norganizations, with a common mandate and a clear\r\nchain of command. By “long-term”, I mean that\r\ninternational support should remain in place until\r\nsecurity is seen to be durable and rehabilitation and\r\nlocal empowerment have become a reality.\r\nThe stabilization and rehabilitation process in\r\nAfghanistan is a test for the changing pattern of\r\ninternational cooperation. Ultimately, reconstruction\r\nefforts must be directed towards sustainability and\r\nownership by the Afghan people. The recent attempt on\r\nPresident Karzai’s life demonstrates the frailty of the\r\ncurrent situation in Afghanistan. This and the attacks in\r\nKabul and other cities are dramatic reminders of the\r\nprice paid by too many Afghan generations for\r\nrecovering their sovereignty and for winning the right\r\nto govern their country.\r\nThe intense effort that the United Nations has\r\nembarked upon in the democratic and physical\r\nreconstruction of the country is commendable.\r\nRomania believes that this commitment must be\r\nmaintained as long as the dangers of a serious renewal\r\nof violence exist. Romania has already made a solid\r\nfinancial contribution to the international aid effort and\r\nis ready to offer further assistance, according to the\r\nrequirements of the Afghan Government.\r\nBut efforts to aid Afghanistan should not stop at\r\nthat country’s borders. Stability for that country and the\r\nregion will be assured only through a broader vision\r\nfor the development of the whole of Central Asia. We\r\nneed to find a way to link Europe and Central Asia by\r\nworking up an integrated strategy that will reinforce\r\ndemocracy and bring economic prosperity not only\r\nacross Europe, but to Eurasia as well. A first step must\r\nbe to put an end to the “frozen conflicts” in Eastern\r\nEurope and the Caucasus.\r\nThe positive developments in South-East Europe\r\nshow what can be achieved when the international\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\ncommunity takes action in a coherent and coordinated\r\nway. The United Nations and its international partners,\r\nnotably the European Union, the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, have worked tirelessly to\r\nhelp to reconstitute societies based on the rule of law\r\nand ethnic tolerance, but the process is not yet\r\ncomplete. It is vital that this decisive electoral autumn\r\nshow beyond doubt that modern democracy has taken\r\nroot in the western Balkans. By ensuring free and fair\r\nelections, political leaders in the region should keep\r\ntheir countries on the right path to European\r\nintegration. As Romania draws closer to achieving its\r\nEuro-Atlantic integration ambitions, we will continue\r\nto contribute actively to efforts to break down the\r\nremaining divisions in South-East Europe and to speed\r\nup the integration of the whole region into the\r\nEuropean mainstream.\r\nThe violent conflicts over the last decade awoke\r\nthe world to the need for action against the horror of\r\nwar crimes. The entry into force on 1 July of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court Statute represents a very\r\nsignificant step forward. Romania ratified the\r\nInternational Criminal Court Statute this year and\r\nremains deeply committed to ensuring that the Court\r\nfunction effectively as a viable and necessary\r\ninstrument of international law. In this spirit, we\r\nencourage ongoing discussions, which should clarify\r\nsome of the outstanding issues.\r\nThe danger that the violence in the Middle East\r\nwill escalate beyond control cannot be ignored. My\r\nrecent discussions with political leaders from the\r\nregion have reinforced my conviction that it is crucial\r\nto find a way to renounce the logic of war in favour of\r\na logic of peace. We call on the parties to engage in\r\nserious negotiations for a peaceful, comprehensive and\r\nlasting solution. Their success or failure will have\r\nconsequences far beyond their own immediate region,\r\nimpacting upon what might be termed the wider\r\nMiddle East, encompassing the entire region from\r\nCentral Asia to North Africa.\r\nThe two serious challenges for the twenty-first\r\ncentury are fighting terrorism and new security threats,\r\non the one hand, and making globalization work for\r\neveryone everywhere, on the other. In both, the United\r\nNations has a decisively important role to play. We\r\nhave reached the point where we must address the\r\nglobal agenda in a way that finally meets people’s\r\nexpectations and achieves early results. We must\r\ndeliver in a coherent and pragmatic way on the\r\ncommitments taken at Doha, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg, as well as other major United Nations\r\nconferences, such as the special session on children.\r\nWe must design an urgent, clear and encouraging\r\nresponse to the humanitarian needs of Africa and\r\npromote conditions for the sustainable development of\r\nthe African continent.\r\nTangible progress depends upon a new paradigm\r\nof cooperation between stakeholders of globalization,\r\nStates, corporations, international organizations and, of\r\ncourse, civil society. Efficient implementation depends\r\nupon a new architecture of global governance that is\r\nfitted to today’s realities and a renewed sense of\r\nresponsibility among all States. Finally, success in\r\nachieving the millennium development goals depends\r\nupon a strict and verifiable system for monitoring\r\nimplementation. A new sense of participation and\r\npartnership must energize our common contribution. In\r\nthis respect, We welcome President Bush’s\r\nannouncement that the United States will rejoin the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe graduation of the Central European countries\r\nfrom transition economies to membership of the\r\nEuropean Union in the few years to come is proof that\r\ndemocracy with a functioning market economy and an\r\nopen society does work. But there is a price, and that is\r\nthe difficult decisions, politically and socially, of\r\nsuccessful transition.\r\nWe have been fortunate to have European Union\r\nfinancial support and know-how, which have been vital\r\nin maintaining the momentum and the public\r\nacceptance of sometimes painful reform programmes.\r\nIn return, we will do the same by sharing the burden of\r\ninternational responsibility and assistance. We have not\r\nonly a moral and historic, but also a strategic,\r\nresponsibility to address the needs of the poor and\r\ndisadvantaged in our region and beyond. Discontent\r\nand disillusionment breed instability, which in turn\r\ngives terrorism fertile conditions in which to flourish.\r\nGovernments, business and civil society have a\r\nunique opportunity to accelerate economic\r\ndevelopment through the use of the powerful new\r\ninformation and communication technologies. In\r\npreparation for the forthcoming World Summit on the\r\nInformation Society, to be held at Geneva in 2003 and\r\nat Tunis in 2005, Romania will host, from 7 to 9\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nNovember this year, a regional conference at the\r\nministerial level organized jointly with the\r\nInternational Telecommunication Union and the\r\nEconomic Commission for Europe. Our aim is to draw\r\nup a preliminary plan of action with specific\r\nmechanisms for bridging the digital divide.\r\nThe Security Council is the linchpin of the United\r\nNations. Romania believes that we must redouble our\r\nefforts to promote reform of that body. The\r\ncomposition of the Council should be more\r\nrepresentative of our global membership and should\r\nreflect more accurately the realities of the global\r\nbalance of power today. Romania’s candidature for a\r\nCouncil seat in 2004-2005 is motivated by our deep\r\ncommitment to the United Nations as a credible and\r\nefficient contributor to peace and stability around the\r\nworld.\r\nWhat will we take home from this session? We\r\nneed to reflect on how to eliminate the habit of ad hoc\r\ncooperation. We need to think creatively and to craft\r\ncontinuous patterns of teamwork, and we should be\r\nmore receptive to what people want from the United\r\nNations. That is how we can best live up to our\r\ncommitments and overcome what is seen as the\r\nhandicap of international organizations: the\r\ndiscrepancy between words and deeds. Let us leave this\r\nsession determined to work on mapping out pledges\r\nand achievements in a way that will add vigour to our\r\nwords and reinforce our credibility. That, after all, is\r\nthe source of our unique strength.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Joschka Fischer, Deputy Chancellor\r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany.\r\nMr. Fischer (Germany) (spoke in German;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): First of all, I\r\nshould like to wish you every success, Mr. President, in\r\nyour responsible office. We are delighted that you, a\r\nrepresentative of our Czech neighbours, will preside\r\nover the General Assembly this year. I also express my\r\nsincere thanks to the outgoing President.\r\nI endorse the statement of the Danish presidency\r\nof the European Union.\r\nOne year ago, the world was shaken by the terror\r\nof 11 September, which was disdainful of human life.\r\nCivilian aircraft were transformed into guided missiles\r\nwhose deployment had been planned without any\r\nregard for human life. The devastating consequences\r\ndestroyed families, shattered hopes and tore people\r\napart, regardless of their age, gender or religious\r\naffiliation. Three days ago, we remembered the victims\r\nin a moving ceremony here in New York. We have not\r\nforgotten the images of 11 September; we have not\r\nrecovered from the shock. Our solidarity with the\r\nUnited States is unbroken. We understand our\r\nAmerican friends. Just like them, we are not prepared\r\nto live under the sword of Damocles that terrorism\r\nrepresents.\r\nThe murderous attack on the people and the\r\nAdministration of the United States was also an attack\r\non all open societies. Countless States mourn their\r\ncountrymen among the thousands of World Trade\r\nCenter victims. The attack could have struck any open\r\nsociety, but the terrorists consciously chose the United\r\nStates as a symbol of freedom and democracy.\r\nWe know that the new totalitarian challenge is\r\nalso directed at us all. Since 11 September 2001, the\r\ncommunity of nations has had to look at the question of\r\npeace and security at the dawn of the twenty-first\r\ncentury from a whole new angle. We will not be able to\r\nnegotiate with terrorists like Osama bin Laden. His aim\r\nis to kill as many innocent people as possible, thus\r\ncreating the maximum degree of terror and fear. If the\r\nterrorists succeed in acquiring weapons that are yet\r\nmore horrific, they will deploy them against us all\r\nwithout hesitation. Therefore, we must work together\r\nin the international coalition against terrorism to\r\novercome and destroy that international terrorist\r\nnetwork. The highly dangerous combination of\r\nreligious hatred, smouldering regional conflicts,\r\nterrorist attacks and the danger of the deployment of\r\nweapons of mass destruction must be prevented at any\r\nprice.\r\nBut, above all else, we must not forget: on the\r\none hand, terrorism must be fought resolutely by the\r\nmilitary and police; on the other, we need to resolve the\r\npolitical and social conflicts quite rightly emphasized\r\nin the Millennium Declaration, as they form the\r\nbreeding ground for the emergence of terrorism. Opting\r\nfor one approach and neglecting the other risks failure.\r\nOur common goal is for the people in our\r\ncountries to be able to live in safety and freedom, and\r\nwithout want. To achieve that, we need a system of\r\nglobal cooperative security that, unlike the former\r\nbipolarity of the cold war, includes all levels of global\r\npolicy relevant to security: the relations among great\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nPowers and their alliances as well as the potential\r\ndanger of regional crises and the threat posed by\r\nasymmetrical conflicts. For one thing is clearer than\r\never after 11 September: terrorism threatens world\r\npeace just as much as civil war and regional conflicts.\r\nSuch a system, therefore, must not be toothless, but\r\nrather must function in all three fields through reliable\r\nverification systems and enforceable sanctions\r\nmechanisms. I am convinced that developing such a\r\ncomprehensive system of global cooperative security\r\nwill be our central political task for the twenty-first\r\ncentury.\r\nThis problem can be solved only through\r\nmultilateralism — that is, if nations work together.\r\nTerrorism does not stop at national borders, and\r\nshaping globalization is a task that Governments can\r\nno longer tackle alone. Thus, the United Nations has a\r\nmajor role to play in developing this security system; it\r\nis the most important forum for establishing global\r\nrules. No other organization has comparable legitimacy\r\nand credibility. Decisively strengthening its ability to\r\nact by continuing the reform path of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is, therefore, a central focus of German foreign\r\npolicy.\r\nThe developments in Iraq fill us with grave\r\nconcern. Saddam Hussein’s regime is a brutal\r\ndictatorship. Under his leadership, Iraq has attacked its\r\nneighbours Iran and Kuwait, has fired missiles at Israel\r\nand has used poison gas against Iran and against its\r\nown Kurdish population. The regime is horrendous for\r\nthe Iraqi people and a risk to the region. For that\r\nreason, an effective containment policy and reliable\r\nmilitary control of the no-fly zones have been\r\nimplemented and a strict sanctions regime against Iraq\r\nhas been introduced since the Gulf War.\r\nThe regime in Baghdad must not own or produce\r\nthe means for mass destruction or the systems to\r\ndeliver them. Despite binding demands from the\r\nSecurity Council, Saddam Hussein refuses to provide\r\ncredible and verifiable answers to the pressing\r\nquestions posed by the community of nations regarding\r\nhis weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the United\r\nNations not only must maintain the pressure on the\r\nIraqi Government but also must intensify it.\r\nWe welcome the fact that President Bush, in his\r\nmost recent speech, turned towards the Security\r\nCouncil. Even if it becomes very difficult, we must do\r\neverything possible to find a diplomatic solution.\r\nThe Security Council and Member States must\r\nmake it unequivocally clear to Baghdad that the\r\nunrestricted and unconditional re-admission of the\r\nweapons inspectors is the only way to avert a great\r\ntragedy for Iraq and the entire region. The Iraqi\r\nGovernment must implement all relevant Security\r\nCouncil resolutions in their entirety and without delay.\r\nWe do not, however, want any automatism\r\nleading to the use of military force. The fight against\r\ninternational terrorism remains perilous. We have not\r\nyet managed to fully stabilize Afghanistan. Explosive\r\nregional conflicts in Kashmir, the Middle East and the\r\nCaucasus must be resolved or at least effectively\r\ncontained.\r\nCertain central questions arise for us. Have all\r\neconomic and political means of pressure been truly\r\nexhausted? What consequences would military\r\nintervention have? What would it mean for regional\r\nstability? What effect would it have on the Middle East\r\nconflict? Are there new, concrete findings and facts?\r\nDoes the situation as assessed justify the taking of a\r\ngreat risk, namely, taking responsibility for peace and\r\nstability in the entire region for years or even decades\r\nto come? Would such action gain the consent of the\r\nArab neighbours? What consequences would it have\r\nfor the continuation of the global coalition against\r\nterrorism? In the face of these open questions, we feel\r\ndeep scepticism with regard to military action and thus\r\nhold to our approach.\r\nI would like to pose the further question of\r\nwhether a peaceful solution to the question of the\r\nMiddle East could not contribute considerably more to\r\nthe establishment of regional stability, to the successful\r\nfight against terrorism and to the effective control and\r\ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction. In that\r\nway, would the regime in Baghdad not be isolated\r\nmuch more effectively, thus generating political\r\npressure for change? Would this cooperative approach\r\nto finding a new order for the region not be a more\r\npromising way to bring democracy to the Middle\r\nEast — one that would be supported by the regional\r\nPowers?\r\nNowhere is the connection between terrorism and\r\nregional conflict more obvious than in the Near and\r\nMiddle East. The breakthrough to peace is therefore of\r\nparamount importance in that region of the world. The\r\nconsensus among the international community of\r\nnations on the Middle East question is now greater than\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\never. We must all pull together to achieve the goal\r\nenvisaged by President Bush for 2005, that of two\r\nStates, Israel and a democratic Palestine, living as\r\nneighbours within secure and recognized borders. The\r\nEuropean Union has devised a road map to achieve that\r\ngoal. An early conference on the Middle East could\r\nhelp to build bridges and accelerate the process.\r\nTogether with our European Union partners, we are\r\nready to make a considerable contribution in that\r\nrespect.\r\nA comprehensive peace in the Middle East must\r\nalso include Lebanon and Syria. Saudi Arabia’s\r\nsignificant initiative contains the assurance that the\r\nArab world would then also be ready to fully normalize\r\nits relations with Israel.\r\nWithout a just and lasting solution to regional\r\nconflicts, we will not be able to eliminate the\r\nrecruitment base for terrorists and thus successfully\r\ncounter the asymmetrical threat. Afghanistan is an\r\nobvious example here. The Taliban system has\r\ncollapsed there and the Al Qaeda network has largely\r\nbeen destroyed. We are still a long way from being able\r\nto call the situation in the country stable and secure,\r\nbut progress can be noted. The implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the Bonn Conference agreement began\r\nwith the formation of a legitimate Interim\r\nAdministration. The process that was launched on the\r\nPetersberg was taken to the next level with the\r\nconvening in June of the emergency loya jirga. For the\r\nfirst time in years, the Afghan people have the chance\r\nto lead a life of dignity based on self-determination.\r\nThe people of Afghanistan will only grow in\r\ncourage, however, when they see and feel that the\r\ninternational community is also standing by its pledges\r\nfor the reconstruction of their country. The\r\ncommitments of the donor countries must materialize\r\nin the form of concrete projects.\r\nA system of global cooperative security must be\r\nbased on a comprehensive security concept. This must\r\nembrace not only military security but also the\r\neconomy, human rights, democracy and culture.\r\n“To achieve a safer world, we must create a better\r\nworld”: that is how President Bush summed up the\r\nsituation in his impressive speech to the German\r\nBundestag last May. Shaping cooperative global\r\nsecurity therefore also means shaping a new global\r\neconomic order. Account must be taken of the needs of\r\nall — the developing and the developed world alike.\r\nResources must be more fairly distributed and poorer\r\ncountries must be able to participate in international\r\ntrade and take advantage of the opportunities of\r\nglobalization. This will necessitate free market access\r\nfor all, as well as the realization of economic and\r\npolitical freedoms and a just and reliable legal\r\nframework.\r\nWe must not close our eyes to the problems of\r\nAfrica, in particular. The food situation in the South of\r\nthe continent is a particular source of concern.\r\nCountless people are going hungry and comprehensive\r\nassistance is needed there. In Zimbabwe, however, the\r\nformer granary of Africa, a wholly irresponsible policy\r\nis the reason for the difficult situation. In Zimbabwe,\r\nhunger is caused principally not by failed harvests or\r\ndroughts but by self-destructive governance — a policy\r\nof keeping a grip on power through the suffering of the\r\npeople. Such a policy relies upon the fact that the\r\ninternational community’s humanitarian conscience\r\nand readiness to assume responsibility will reduce the\r\nconsequences. We must hold this policy up against the\r\nbenchmarks defined by Africa itself in the framework\r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.\r\nClimate and energy policy is a key component of\r\nthe new global economic order. The Kyoto Protocol\r\ncan be seen as a milestone in global climate protection.\r\nI am delighted that several countries have recently\r\nannounced plans to ratify the Protocol, and hope that\r\nthis will happen as soon as possible so that it can enter\r\ninto force. In the long term, a sensible energy policy —\r\nand that means, above all, the promotion of renewable\r\nenergy sources and economical energy consumption —\r\nis the best solution to the climate problem. Work must\r\ntherefore start today. Let us not forget that difficult\r\neconomic and ecological problems, with their social\r\nand humanitarian repercussions, will increasingly\r\nendanger stability and security too.\r\nThe protection of human rights must be one of the\r\npillars of a global security system. All efforts to secure\r\npeace will fail if human rights are not protected and\r\nmade a reality. We need a binding global set of values\r\nto prevent and overcome conflicts that emerge through\r\ninequality, injustice and the denial of freedom. Here,\r\ntoo, States are called upon to play a decisive and active\r\nrole. Moreover, we must be careful today to ensure that\r\nbasic human rights are not annulled under the pretext\r\nof combating terrorism. No one has the right to an\r\n“anti-terrorism bonus”.\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nCooperative global security will have to measure\r\nup to the binding legal framework in which it is\r\nembedded. It is imperative for the globalization process\r\nto be flanked by a growing set of international rules,\r\nbecause international law and the rule of law constitute\r\nthe indispensable foundations for peaceful and ordered\r\ncoexistence. That is why the establishment of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is so important to us. Its\r\nStatute entered into force on 1 July; Germany, along\r\nwith all the other members of the European Union, is\r\namong the 79 States to have ratified it. The Assembly\r\nof States Parties gave the green light this week to the\r\nestablishment of the Court. Next spring we will\r\ncelebrate its opening in The Hague. The International\r\nCriminal Court will start work as soon as possible and\r\nas efficiently as possible. But it must not be weakened\r\nin its work from the outset.\r\nMy country is applying for a non-permanent seat\r\non the Security Council for the period 2003-2004.\r\nGermany wants to play an active role in developing the\r\ninternational security system within the United Nations\r\nalong the lines that I have outlined. I would like to ask\r\nall members for their vote in the election on 27\r\nSeptember.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Felipe Pérez Roque, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nMr. Pérez Roque (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): A\r\nyear ago, the General Assembly had to be postponed\r\nbecause of the ruthless crime committed on 11\r\nSeptember. There was then a worldwide wave of\r\nsolidarity towards the people of the United States and,\r\nparticularly, towards the families of the almost 3,000\r\ninnocent victims of that unjustifiable terrorist attack.\r\nThe conditions were created for setting up a\r\ngenuine international alliance under the auspices and\r\nleadership of the United Nations, with absolute respect\r\nfor the purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter.\r\nNearly all countries, above and beyond ideological,\r\npolitical, cultural and religious differences, expressed\r\nour willingness to collaborate actively with this\r\nendeavour of unmistakable common interest.\r\nHowever, another vision was imposed. In an\r\nunusual fashion, it was stated that whoever did not\r\nsupport the war decided upon by a single country\r\nwould then be on the side of terrorism. It was even\r\nannounced to the Security Council that that country\r\nreserved the right to launch future attacks on its own\r\nagainst other nations. A unilateral war was then\r\nunleashed, whose death toll is still unknown to us and\r\nwhose most tangible consequence is probably the blow\r\nto the credibility of the United Nations and to\r\nmultilateralism as a means to cope with the complex\r\nchallenges currently ahead of us.\r\nWhat is the outcome today? There are greater\r\nfeelings of hatred, vengeance and insecurity, which are\r\nnot helpful in the fight against terrorism. Dangerous\r\nxenophobic and discriminatory tendencies threaten the\r\nexistence of a plural and democratic world. There has\r\nbeen a step backward in the field of public freedoms\r\nand civil rights.\r\nIn the meantime, there is a lack of political will\r\nby certain powers to rigorously apply, without\r\nselectivity and without double standards, the 12\r\nexisting international legal instruments on terrorism. In\r\naddition, no advances have been made in the definition,\r\nso indispensable today, of State terrorism.\r\nFor its part, Cuba — a victim of terrorist acts for\r\nover four decades, which stated its opinions in the\r\nAssembly with poise and firmness and unwaveringly\r\ncondemned the crime of September 11 and terrorism as\r\nsuch, but which also opposed the war out of ethical\r\nconsiderations and the respect for international law —\r\nsigned and ratified the 12 international conventions to\r\ncombat terrorism and adopted a national law to fight\r\nthis scourge. It has cooperated fully with the work of\r\nthe committee set up for such purposes by the Security\r\nCouncil and, at the bilateral level, it proposed to the\r\nUnited States Government the adoption of a\r\nprogramme to combat terrorism, which was,\r\nincomprehensibly, rejected by that Government.\r\nUntil today, and despite the fact that it has not\r\ndeveloped and has no intention ever to develop nuclear\r\nweapons, Cuba has not been a State party to the Treaty\r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, for it is\r\nan insufficient and discriminatory instrument allowing\r\nthe establishment of a club of nuclear powers without\r\nany concrete disarmament commitments. However, as a\r\nsignal of the clear political will of the Cuban\r\nGovernment and its commitment to an effective\r\ndisarmament process that ensures world peace, our\r\ncountry has decided to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In doing so, we\r\nreaffirm our hope that all nuclear weapons will finally\r\nbe totally eliminated under strict international\r\nverification.\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nIn addition, and despite the fact that the only\r\nnuclear power in the Americas pursues a policy of\r\nhostility towards Cuba that does not rule out the use of\r\nforce, Cuba will also ratify the Treaty for the\r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and\r\nthe Caribbean, known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco, that\r\nwas signed by our country in 1995.\r\nOn a day like today, I would like to repeat Cuba’s\r\nremarks at the last session of the General Assembly:\r\n“Only under the leadership of the United\r\nNations will we be able to defeat terrorism.\r\nCooperation, and not war, is the way. The\r\ncoordination of actions, and not imposition ... is\r\nthe method. ...\r\n“Cuba reiterates its condemnation of\r\nterrorism in all of its forms and manifestations.\r\nCuba reiterates that it will not allow its territory\r\never to be used for terrorist acts against the\r\npeople of the United States or of any other\r\ncountry.” (A/56/PV.50, pp. 21 and 22)\r\nWhy have we not seen the same zeal with which\r\nthe war in Afghanistan was unleashed in the search for\r\na just and lasting solution for peace in the Middle East?\r\nWhy have some refrained from uttering even a single\r\nword to condemn the aggressions against the territory\r\nof Palestine and the crimes against its people? Why has\r\nthere not been any condemnation of the selective\r\nassassinations and the use of the armed forces against\r\nthe civilian population? Why are there assurances of\r\nimpunity for the actions of the Israeli army, thus tying\r\nthe hands of the Security Council? Why have there not\r\nbeen any firm actions to implement the Security\r\nCouncil resolutions that ensure the proclamation of an\r\nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State, with East\r\nJerusalem as its capital? Why is the only superpower\r\non the planet acting differently from one case to the\r\nother? Why is there no end to the suffering of the\r\nPalestinian mothers whose children are also murdered,\r\nlike the innocent people on 11 September? These\r\nquestions should be answered by those who in this Hall\r\ncarry upon their shoulders the responsibility for what is\r\ncurrently happening in the occupied Palestinian and\r\nArab territories.\r\nA new war against Iraq already seems inevitable;\r\nan aggravation of the situation of constant aggression\r\nthat that people has lived in over the last ten years. The\r\nbuzzword now is “pre-emptive war”, in open violation\r\nof the spirit and the letter of the United Nations\r\nCharter.\r\nCuba defends principles, not expedience.\r\nTherefore, although its supporters may feel upset, it\r\nemphatically opposes this war. Cuba is not driven by\r\nan anti-American spirit, even when its Government\r\nmaintains and strengthens a 40-year-old blockade\r\nagainst our people. But refraining from telling the truth\r\nout of cowardice or political calculation is not\r\ncharacteristic of Cuban revolutionaries. Therefore,\r\nCuba hereby states that it opposes a new military\r\naction against Iraq. It does so while recalling that at\r\none point it supported the Security Council resolution\r\nasking the Iraqi Government to end the occupation of\r\nKuwait.\r\nWe believe that the development of weapons of\r\nmass destruction today would be insane, because the\r\nonly possible way that we envision for world peace is\r\nthrough general and complete disarmament, including\r\nnuclear disarmament, and the rechannelling of the\r\nmoney currently spent on weapons to address the dire\r\nsocio-economic problems of humankind.\r\nThe Arab countries have been emphatic in their\r\nrejection of this war, and most European countries do\r\nnot approve of it. The international community is\r\nincreasingly concerned about the announcement of a\r\nnew war on the basis of unconfirmed allegations and\r\ndisregarding the obvious reality that Iraq cannot pose a\r\ndanger to the United States.\r\nIf the United States Government unleashes a new\r\nwar against Iraq, either by imposing it on the Security\r\nCouncil or by deciding upon it unilaterally in\r\nopposition to international public opinion, we will bear\r\nwitness to the emergence of a century of unilateralism\r\nand the forced retirement of the United Nations. It will\r\nthen seem that the cold war years — with its distant\r\nmemory of bipolarism, mistakes and contradictions —\r\nwere not as futile and perilous as the era that is now\r\ninexorably looming over the world.\r\nThe United Nations has to be saved. Cuba\r\ndefends the need both for its preservation and for its\r\nmost profound reform and democratization, but all this\r\nmust be accomplished through respect for its Charter\r\nand not by rewriting it or distorting its purposes and\r\nprinciples. The General Assembly must ultimately be\r\nallowed to play the role laid down for it in the Charter.\r\nThe Security Council has to be rescued from the\r\ndisrepute and doubts that are so rightly weighing it\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\ndown, so that it may become a truly representative\r\nbody. I am talking about the presence of the third world\r\nand not about military power as a justification for\r\nmembership of a democratic body; I am talking about\r\neliminating the veto and other antidemocratic practices\r\nfrom a transparent body; and I am talking about putting\r\nan end to the secret conspiracies and to the substantive\r\ndecisions made in private by a mere few and then\r\nimposed on the rest.\r\nToday, when it is more threatened than ever, Cuba\r\nstrongly defends the need to preserve multilateralism in\r\ninternational relations. That is why we have witnessed\r\nin frustration the disappointing completion of the\r\nnegotiations for the establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court, which Cuba supported on the\r\nunderstanding that it would be a truly impartial, non-\r\nselective, efficient and independent body to\r\ncomplement national justice systems. To use the\r\nSecurity Council as a tool to amend de facto the\r\ninternational treaty that gave birth to the Court, or to\r\nimpose upon others humiliating bilateral agreements,\r\ncompelling them to violate their international\r\nobligations deriving from that instrument, is not only\r\narrogant, but also irresponsible.\r\nThe International Criminal Court now vaunted is\r\nnot the body that we need and have fought for, subject\r\nas it is to hegemonic political interests and already a\r\npotential victim of manipulation, and bound from its\r\ninception to the decisions of a permanent member of\r\nthe Security Council. What real international justice\r\ncan be expected of a body that lacks a definition of the\r\ncrime of aggression or that will receive instructions\r\nfrom the Security Council either to call off or to\r\npostpone a trial indefinitely at the request of one of its\r\npermanent members? Who can guarantee that the Court\r\nwill not end up becoming an instrument at the service\r\nof interventionism and domination by the most\r\npowerful countries?\r\nCuba reiterates here today what it expressed at\r\nthe recent Johannesburg Summit: a reworking of\r\ninternational financial institutions is called for. A\r\nlegitimate replacement for the International Monetary\r\nFund is called for. It is essential that the work of the\r\nWorld Bank be aimed at supporting the genuine\r\nexercise by over 130 third world countries of their right\r\nto development. It is essential that the United Nations\r\nsystem be provided with new financial resources to\r\nfight poverty, underdevelopment, disease and famine. It\r\nis essential that the World Trade Organization be\r\nrescued from the interests of a handful of rich and\r\npowerful countries and transformed into an instrument\r\nat the service of a fair and equitable international\r\ntrading system.\r\nThe meagre results derived from the Monterrey\r\nand Johannesburg conferences and the justified wave\r\nof annoyance and uncertainty in their wake once again\r\nraise the issue of the lack of political will by the major\r\nindustrialized Powers to relinquish a portion of their\r\nprivileges in order to produce a real change in the\r\nunfair and unsustainable world order that is currently\r\nvisiting impoverishment and hopelessness upon two\r\nthirds of the planet’s population.\r\nI recognize that Cuba’s remarks may not be\r\naccepted by some in this Hall. I even understand that\r\nthey could be interpreted as a tirade against a country\r\nin particular. However, that is not the reason. Words\r\nmust be used to uphold the truth and that is what Cuba\r\nhas done and will always do. We are a small, noble\r\npeople that long ago proclaimed that, for all Cubans,\r\n“motherland is humankind”.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nMinister of State for Foreign Affairs of Oman, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdulla.\r\nMr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): It gives\r\nme great pleasure to offer, on behalf of the Government\r\nof the Sultanate of Oman, our warmest congratulations\r\nto you, Sir, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its current session. We assure you of our\r\nfullest cooperation towards achieving the noble goals\r\nand objectives to which we collectively aspire for the\r\nbenefit of mankind and the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn this connection, we wish to express our\r\nappreciation for the ongoing tireless efforts of\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on behalf of\r\ninternational peace and security, the rule of\r\ninternational law and the work of the Organization in\r\nthis regard. We also thank him for his annual report,\r\nwhich details the achievements of the United Nations,\r\nthe obstacles ahead and its vision of the future,\r\nembodying the conscience and aspirations of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nI also take this opportunity to welcome the\r\naccession of the Swiss Federation and the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste to membership of the United\r\nNations. We are confident that their membership will\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nbe an important asset in the promotion of the work of\r\nthis Organization in achieving its noble goals of\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nHere in the renowned city of New York, we are\r\ncommemorating the terrorist attacks of 11 September\r\n2001. Once again, we would like to express our deepest\r\nsympathies and condolences to the families of the\r\nvictims of that senseless attack. We wish also to\r\nreaffirm our solidarity with the United States of\r\nAmerica in fighting all forms of terror against innocent\r\npeople everywhere.\r\nThe Middle East is experiencing increased\r\ntension due to a serious regression in the peace process\r\non all tracks, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian track.\r\nThe primary causes of this are the Israeli Government’s\r\ndeviation from the fair principles and foundations\r\nestablished at the 1991 Madrid Conference, and the\r\ndesire of successive Israeli Governments since 1996 to\r\nimpose peace through excessive force. This runs\r\ncounter to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\r\n338 (1973), and to the formula of land for peace. Israel\r\nis pursuing a policy of procrastination and intimidation\r\nand is circumventing international instruments and\r\nagreements signed by the parties concerned. This has\r\nresulted in a further escalation of Palestinian\r\nresistance, by all factions and in all forms, to Israeli\r\noccupation.\r\nMy Government condemns all terrorist acts,\r\nregardless of their motivation and deplores all acts of\r\nviolence against innocent civilians, whether perpetrated\r\nby the Palestinian or the Israeli side. Events have\r\nproven that the use of force against the Palestinian\r\npeople will not lead to a fair solution, to an end to\r\nviolence or to security, as the Israeli Government\r\nclaims; nor will it end the legitimate Palestinian\r\nresistance against Israeli occupation. The end of such\r\nresistance is contingent upon the end of Israeli\r\noccupation.\r\nAll Arab States have affirmed that the\r\nachievement of a peace based on the principles of\r\ninternational law and justice is our strategic choice, and\r\nwe have exerted great efforts to that end, the latest\r\nbeing the Arab peace initiative adopted unanimously at\r\nthe Beirut Summit held last March. This historic\r\ninitiative was widely welcomed by the international\r\ncommunity because it is in conformity with\r\ninternational legitimacy and principles, and in\r\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973), which demand the withdrawal\r\nof Israel from the Arab territories occupied since June\r\n1967, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif, and the granting to\r\nPalestinian refugees of the right to return, in return for\r\nthe recognition of Israel by Arab States and the\r\nnormalization of relations with it.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) sets out\r\nthe concept of establishing a recognized Palestinian\r\nState peacefully coexisting alongside the State of\r\nIsrael. In that connection, my Government calls on the\r\ninternational community, especially Security Council\r\nmembers, to shoulder their responsibility to ensure that\r\nthe Israeli Government will respect and implement\r\nrelevant international resolutions and respond seriously\r\nto Arab and international efforts.\r\nMy Government supports the just position taken\r\nby the Syrian Arab Republic with respect to regaining\r\nthe occupied Golan Heights and its request for Israeli\r\nwithdrawal to the line of 4 June 1967. In the same vein,\r\nwe support the position of the Republic of Lebanon\r\nwith regard to recovering the occupied Shab’a farms\r\narea and its demand that Israel fully implement\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for\r\nthe immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from all\r\nLebanese territory, including the Shab’a farms area.\r\nThe overall humanitarian situation in Iraq\r\nremains tragic due to the ongoing economic sanctions\r\nimposed on Iraq since August 1990. Consequently, my\r\nGovernment emphasizes the importance of a Security\r\nCouncil review of the international sanctions policy\r\nimposed on countries, a review that would lead to\r\neasing the humanitarian harm that befalls peoples, and\r\nthat would take into consideration the status of a\r\ntargeted Government’s implementation of international\r\nresolutions.\r\nMy Government reiterates its call upon the\r\nSecurity Council to put an end to the human suffering\r\nin Iraq, and in that regard we call for the continuation\r\nof dialogue and discussions between Iraq and the\r\nUnited Nations with a view to Iraq fulfilling its\r\nremaining international commitments. The Security\r\nCouncil needs to put in place a clear-cut and specific\r\nmechanism telling Iraq what it needs to do to end the\r\ntragic suffering and to arrive at a final and complete\r\nlifting of the economic sanctions.\r\nWe feel optimistic and pleased at the\r\naccomplishments of the Arab Summit in Beirut,\r\nespecially in terms of its positive climate in creating a\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nspirit of understanding and rapprochement between\r\nIraq and Kuwait. In that connection, my Government\r\nwelcomes the Iraqi initiative to return the Kuwaiti\r\nnational archives and urges the Iraqi Government to\r\npersist with the option of continuous and constructive\r\ndialogue and serious consultations to fulfil its\r\nunfulfilled commitments under Security Council\r\nresolutions, specifically relating to prisoners of war\r\nand missing Kuwaiti and third-country citizens. In that\r\nregard, we urge the Iraqi Government to cooperate with\r\nthe Tripartite Commission and the International\r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to deal with this\r\nhumanitarian issue.\r\nMy Government is confident that the Iraqi file\r\ncannot be closed without continuous diplomatic efforts\r\nby all, through United Nations channels and in any\r\nother political way available. We thus find no\r\njustification for any military operation against Iraq. We\r\ntherefore welcome the statement made by President\r\nGeorge W. Bush of the United States at the outset of\r\nthe general debate, in which he spoke of addressing the\r\nIraqi crisis through the Security Council.\r\nMy Government follows with great interest and\r\noptimism the official contacts maintained between the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nregarding the dispute on the three islands belonging to\r\nthe Emirates, Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser\r\nTunb. We hope that these contacts and negotiations will\r\nlead to an agreement on an effective mechanism for the\r\nsettlement of this issue.\r\nMy country, along with other countries in the\r\nregion, is interested in the establishment of security\r\nand stability in the Indian subcontinent. In that regard,\r\nwe place high value on international efforts to contain\r\nthe conflict between India and Pakistan, and we urge\r\nthose countries to benefit from international diplomacy\r\nto agree on an effective mechanism leading to a\r\npeaceful and final settlement of the Kashmir dispute.\r\nRegarding Afghanistan, we welcome the return of\r\nthat country to the international family, and we look\r\nforward to the establishment of security and stability in\r\nits territory under the supervision of a Government\r\nreflecting the aspirations of all parties in Afghanistan.\r\nMy Government values international efforts to assist\r\nthe Afghan Government and the international\r\ncommunity’s ongoing financial and technical assistance\r\nfor rebuilding the country and providing for the basic\r\nneeds of the Afghan people after so many years of\r\nsuffering and war.\r\nMy country condemns all forms of terrorism. In\r\nline with the purposes of the United Nations in the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we\r\nreaffirm our support for international efforts to fight\r\nterrorism and our commitment to the relevant\r\ninternational resolutions, including Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), and all relevant Islamic, Arab\r\nand international treaties and agreements to which my\r\ncountry has acceded. My delegation expresses its\r\nreadiness to cooperate with the United Nations in\r\nfighting international terrorism, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of international law and the principle of\r\nnational sovereignty, and taking into account the need\r\nto distinguish between terrorism and legitimate\r\nresistance against occupation. The Sultanate of Oman\r\nsupports the call for the convening under United\r\nNations auspices of an international conference on\r\nterrorism in order to agree on a clear international\r\ndefinition of terrorism and to set up a mechanism to\r\naddress and eradicate terrorism.\r\nMy country deeply believes that the accession\r\nand commitment of States to treaties and conventions\r\non disarmament will strengthen and preserve peace and\r\nsecurity on the regional and international levels.\r\nConsequently, the signature of the Sultanate of Oman\r\nremains on the record as a State party to such treaties.\r\nBased on that principle, we emphasize the need to\r\ntake practical measures to make the Middle East a\r\nregion free from all weapons of mass destruction. In\r\nthat connection, we request Israel to join all relevant\r\ntreaties, beginning with the Treaty on the Non-\r\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and to subject\r\nits nuclear facilities to the safeguards inspection regime\r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. That\r\nwould create a positive climate and put an end to arms\r\nproliferation in the region.\r\nMy country calls on the United Nations to\r\ncontinue its broad-based efforts to rid the world\r\ncompletely of all types of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nWe urge nuclear-weapon States in particular to\r\nformulate time-bound programmes to achieve that goal\r\nas soon as possible. In that regard, my Government\r\ncommends the United States and the Russian\r\nFederation for having reached an agreement on the\r\nreduction of their nuclear arsenals.\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nMy country is currently presiding over the Gulf\r\nCooperation Council (GCC), and hosted the twenty-\r\nsecond session of the Supreme Council of the GCC,\r\nheld in December 2001 in Muscat. That summit\r\nresulted in the adoption of many decisions and\r\nresolutions and other achievements, including the\r\nsigning of an economic agreement among member\r\nStates and an agreement on a standardized customs\r\nduty of 5 per cent on all imported goods. That\r\nagreement will take effect when a customs union\r\namong member States comes into force at the\r\nbeginning of next year. The Council also took a\r\ndecision on a unified Gulf currency. That will enhance\r\neconomic structures, facilitate differential trade and\r\nincrease the Gulf’s competitiveness with other regional\r\neconomic groups, in addition to promoting the labour\r\nmarket and the private sector in our countries. It will\r\nalso attract more investors and commercial\r\npartnerships within the great Arab region, with other\r\nfriendly States, and in world markets.\r\nAmong the prominent results of the Muscat\r\nsummit was our leaders’ decision to invite the Republic\r\nof Yemen to join a number of Gulf joint\r\nestablishments. That decision was taken based on the\r\nmutual desire and deep belief of both parties that the\r\nincorporation of Yemen into the GCC in a gradual and\r\ncalculated manner will conform to the economic and\r\nsocial needs and development circumstances of Yemen\r\nand will serve the common interests of the region.\r\nWe are working to preserve the environment. We\r\nhave a strong record of achievements and measures\r\ntaken by our Government to plan national\r\nenvironmental protection strategies. However, it is no\r\nsecret that many obstacles threaten our environment\r\ninternally, regionally and internationally. Among the\r\nchallenges is the lack of sufficient water to cope with\r\npopulation growth, which will endanger our population\r\nand will increase the risk of desertification, making it\r\nnecessary that we intensify scientific research and\r\nallocate the resources necessary for that purpose.\r\nWe are happy to have participated in the\r\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, and we wish to emphasize our interest in\r\nthe outcome documents adopted at the conference. We\r\nalso take this opportunity to emphasize the need to\r\nrespect United Nations resolutions and decisions as\r\nwell as the Charter.\r\nThe President: I remind members of the 15-\r\nminute time limit on statements, and urge them to\r\nadjust their statement to conform to that agreed limit. I\r\nnow call on His Excellency Mr. Erkki Tuomioja,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Finland.\r\nMr. Tuomioja (Finland): One year after the\r\nterrible attacks of 11 September, we commemorate the\r\ninnocent victims of those crimes. The best way we can\r\nhonour their memory is by taking up and acting upon\r\nall the many-faceted challenges that terrorism and\r\nother threats pose to human security. The world has\r\nchanged irrevocably, although we cannot as yet say\r\nexactly how. We do not even know if our immediate\r\nreaction a year ago has been successfully put to use to\r\nmake the world a better and safer place in which to\r\nlive.\r\nAfghanistan is no longer a base for global\r\nterrorism, and joint efforts to uproot terrorist networks\r\nare making progress, but the threat of new attacks has\r\nnot been eliminated. At some stage we will also reach\r\nthe limit of what can be done through military force\r\nand police action alone to stop terrorism. Even where\r\nthe use of military force is clearly necessary and\r\njustified, as it was against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, it\r\nis never an adequate answer. In Afghanistan we are\r\nnow faced with the need to use a full range of civilian\r\ncrisis management capabilities, as well as with the\r\nneed for a long-term commitment to reconstruction and\r\nthe development of a stable and drug-free economy,\r\nand to enable democracy and respect for human rights\r\nto take root in a country that has suffered from war and\r\nstrife for decades. And Afghanistan is only one of\r\nmany places in today’s world where such a\r\ncommitment from the international community is\r\nneeded.\r\nWe must also come to grips with conditions in\r\nwhich some people can regard even terrorism as\r\njustified. To say that does not imply any understanding\r\nfor indiscriminate terrorism. Terrorism is a crime\r\nwhose perpetrators must be brought to justice\r\nirrespective of their motives.\r\nIt is vitally important to underline the need to\r\nstrengthen the rule of law. When terrorists attack\r\ndemocracy, humanity and justice, we should not and\r\ncannot fight it with means that are in conflict with\r\nthose basic values that the terrorists are attacking. It is\r\ntime to review frankly the measures taken after 11\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nSeptember and to rectify any excesses that are not\r\nacceptable in societies based on freedom and justice.\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has been\r\nin gestation for many years, and its creation can be\r\nregarded as one of the major achievements of the\r\nUnited Nations. It was not created primarily to deal\r\nwith terrorism, but the importance of the ICC has\r\nobviously grown, not diminished, since 11 September.\r\nThe ICC is a long-standing goal of Finland and the\r\nEuropean Union, and we must not allow it to be\r\nundermined. The ICC must not become an issue of\r\ninternational dispute. We must safeguard it as an\r\neffective and independent judicial institution so that we\r\ncan convince those States that remain outside it to join\r\nus in making it truly universal.\r\nTerrorism is only one of many new threats to our\r\nsecurity that are no longer linked to the threat of\r\ntraditional war between nation-States.\r\nIn a world where our entire national defence\r\npolicies and our efforts to build collective security\r\nhave been based on the need to wage or deter\r\ntraditional war, we now need new and fresh thinking. It\r\nis not only that military power has become partly\r\nimpotent in delivering security. It is also evident that\r\nwe cannot contain these threats through isolation or by\r\nacting unilaterally.\r\nThe United Nations and its Security Council have\r\nglobal responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Human lives are\r\nequally valuable all over the world. People in crisis\r\nsituations need the protection and the action of the\r\ninternational community. Individual and minor crises\r\ncan turn into major threats to international peace and\r\nsecurity. Member States must give the United Nations\r\nthe wherewithal that is necessary for meaningful action\r\nin preventing crises, managing conflicts and building\r\npeace after conflicts. Action needs true commitment to\r\nmultilateralism, which must exceed national interests\r\nand unilateralism. Multilateralism cannot be exercised\r\nà la carte whenever convenient. Global interests require\r\nglobal action.\r\nAn undeniable success story in the history of the\r\nUnited Nations is the Organization’s peacekeeping\r\nactivities. Countless lives have been saved by United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations. But we know, too,\r\nthat possibly even more lives have been lost if and\r\nwhen the United Nations has not been able or allowed\r\nto operate. The reason has been the lack of political\r\nwill or the prevalence of national interests in the\r\nSecurity Council. I would like to reiterate that the\r\nSecurity Council is mandated to act on behalf of all\r\nMember States.\r\nThe concept of peacekeeping has evolved\r\nconsiderably during the existence of the United Nations\r\nfrom purely military operations into versatile, complex\r\nand continuous efforts that extend in some cases to\r\nnation-building. A growing element in them is civilian\r\ncrisis management. This should be further\r\nstrengthened. Crisis management in its whole\r\ncontinuum should also be based on broad cooperation\r\nand compatibility. Present complex crises are often too\r\ndemanding for any one organization to deal with. All\r\nregional organizations should work closely together\r\nwith the United Nations and other organizations\r\nsharing the burden of maintaining international peace\r\nand security.\r\nThe Middle East remains the region where our\r\nconcerns are most concentrated. The conflict between\r\nIsrael and Palestine has, if anything, worsened. We\r\nsupport all efforts of the “quartet” to get the peace\r\nprocess working again on the basis of the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions. We support the Palestinian\r\nadministration’s effort at reform, which we have rightly\r\ndemanded must be undertaken, and we expect a one-\r\nhundred-per-cent effort from it to stop all terrorist\r\nactivities. At the same time, the Palestinians must be\r\ngiven the prospect of a clear commitment and a\r\ntimetable for the creation of an independent and viable\r\nPalestinian State. The Palestinian administration has to\r\nbe given the resources and conditions with which it can\r\nfulfil the requirements of what the international\r\ncommunity demands of it and of what the Palestinian\r\npeople have the right to expect.\r\nWithout progress in the Middle East peace\r\nprocess, any military action in the region can have\r\nextremely dangerous and unforeseen consequences. It\r\nis imperative that efforts to get Iraq to abide\r\nunconditionally with all the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil remain the responsibility of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWhen the United Nations was founded, the\r\nworld’s population was 2.4 billion. Now we are more\r\nthan 6 billion, and population growth, while slowly\r\nlevelling off, will bring that number to at least 10\r\nbillion before stabilizing. This is a huge challenge for\r\nmankind. We have only a few decades, at most, to\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nbring our economic, production and societal models to\r\nconform to the exigencies of sustainable development.\r\nBut this is not only an environmental challenge.\r\nNations and peoples must learn to live and to act\r\ntogether in an ever-shrinking world where no one can\r\nmanage on his own.\r\nIn a rapidly globalizing world, the need for keen\r\ninternational cooperation becomes all the more evident.\r\nDecisions taken in one part of the world have many\r\neffects elsewhere. This can quickly lead to an ever-\r\nwidening gap and fragmentation between countries and\r\nwithin countries. Comprehensive implementation of the\r\nMillennium Declaration will make an important impact\r\non narrowing that gap. A positive example of the\r\nmeans we can employ to meet the goals of the\r\nDeclaration is the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which demonstrates the\r\ngenuine desire of the African nations to take\r\nresponsibility for their future. Finland attaches great\r\nimportance to the implementation of NEPAD.\r\nGlobalization has wealth-creating potential\r\nthrough the international division of labour and a more\r\nefficient use of resources. It can increase individual\r\nfreedom and make societies more open. But, on the\r\nother hand, it is incontestable that globalization has not\r\nbenefited everybody or every country in an equal\r\nmanner. Globalization can bring risks and threats to the\r\nenvironment, core labour standards and trade unions,\r\nand it can challenge national and minority cultures. It\r\ncan also be socially damaging. On the whole, however,\r\nglobalization is not only inevitable but also potentially\r\npositive. The United Nations has an important role in\r\nmanaging and harnessing globalization for the benefit\r\nof all. We the Member States must fully participate in\r\nthat work.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Sir Rabbie Namaliu,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of Papua\r\nNew Guinea.\r\nSir Rabbie Namaliu (Papua New Guinea): On\r\nbehalf of the people and the Government of Papua New\r\nGuinea, I join previous speakers in congratulating you,\r\nSir, on your election as President of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly. Your election to the\r\nhelm of the Assembly shows the high esteem in which\r\nthe international community holds you and your\r\ncountry, the Czech Republic.\r\nI take this opportunity to express my delegation’s\r\nsincere appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo of South Korea, for his outstanding\r\nstewardship of the work of the fifty-sixth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to place on record my\r\nGovernment’s deep appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ncontinuing strong leadership and immense diplomatic\r\nskill in dealing with many pressing international issues\r\nwhich confront us today.\r\nPapua New Guinea welcomes and congratulates\r\nthe newest State Member of the United Nations,\r\nSwitzerland, and looks forward to the accession to\r\nmembership of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.\r\nPapua New Guinea acknowledges the political\r\nwill and wisdom shown by all parties — the Republic\r\nof Indonesia, Australia, Portugal and the United\r\nNations — in respect of East Timor. We also praise the\r\npeople of Switzerland for their collective decision to\r\nformally join the United Nations.\r\nWith the election of a new Government in my\r\ncountry, our Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir\r\nMichael Somare, recently made a nationwide address\r\ndetailing some of the challenges facing our economy\r\nand what is required to put it back on the path to\r\nrecovery. He identified specific areas and sectors where\r\nremedial measures are needed.\r\nDomestically, our capacity to meet these\r\nchallenges and worthy goals is lacking. The problem is\r\nfurther exacerbated and our capacity further\r\nundermined by poor governance, incompetent\r\neconomic management, a rise in corruption, and\r\ndiminished public confidence in political leadership\r\nand in the fundamentals of representative government.\r\nThe new Government of Papua New Guinea is\r\ndetermined to chart a new course by addressing these\r\nproblems.\r\nThere have been specific initiatives taken to\r\nenhance trade, investment and economic prospects. The\r\nPacific countries members of the African, Caribbean\r\nand Pacific Island Group of States (ACP), together\r\nwith the African and Caribbean member States, are\r\nnow in the process of pursuing negotiations with the\r\nEuropean Union for possible economic partnership\r\nagreements.\r\nRecently, I announced the direction of our\r\nGovernment’s foreign policy focus. I stated that the\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\npolicy must be underpinned by the development and\r\nstrengthening of core relations in the Asia-Pacific\r\nregion.\r\nWe intend to consolidate relations with our close\r\nneighbours and give more emphasis to the promotion\r\nof trade and economic cooperation, investment, and\r\neducation and training.\r\nAs a small island developing country, and as an\r\naffected member of the global village, my country fully\r\nendorses the declarations and plans of action adopted at\r\nrecent world conferences. We believe that international\r\nconferences such as the Doha, Monterrey and\r\nJohannesburg summits and their plans of action are\r\nblueprints to resolve many of the pressing global\r\nchallenges and needs, including poverty eradication;\r\nsustainable development; environmental degradation\r\nand climatic changes; and social ills, including HIV/\r\nAIDS and other preventable diseases. They also echo\r\nthe voices of the majority of the world’s population\r\nliving in poverty and struggling to overcome the\r\nbiggest challenge of all — how to survive.\r\nThese declarations and plans of action are a\r\nfurther amplification of the historic Millennium\r\nDeclaration and its Development Goals, signed by all\r\nour heads of State and Government in September 2000.\r\nThe challenge is to forge new global partnerships\r\nfor change — partnerships in which both developed\r\nand developing countries join together to address the\r\nissues that the global community will face in this new\r\nmillennium. These partnerships also include\r\ninternational financial institutions, intergovernmental\r\norganizations, the private sector, non-governmental\r\norganizations, and civil society.\r\nThese partnerships will be necessary if the shared\r\nhopes of humanity for peace and security, sustainable\r\ndevelopment and a better way of life for all are to be\r\nrealized.\r\nPapua New Guinea has been faced with an\r\ninternal conflict in our province of Bougainville for the\r\nlast decade. Like all previous Governments, the current\r\nGovernment will continue to address the continuing\r\npeaceful resolution of this conflict as a matter of\r\npriority.\r\nPapua New Guinea would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express its appreciation to the United\r\nNations for its role in resolving this crisis. The conflict\r\nhas, in fact, involved substantial commitments of\r\npersonnel and funds by the United Nations,\r\nneighbouring countries and Governments, including\r\nour own.\r\nI would like also to place on record our\r\nappreciation to the Governments of Australia, New\r\nZealand, Fiji and Vanuatu for contributing financial\r\nand manpower resources to the Regional Peace\r\nMonitoring Group to restore peace and security to the\r\nisland.\r\nIn addition, on the recommendations of the\r\nSecretary-General, and in close cooperation between\r\nthe Papua New Guinea Government and the\r\nBougainville parties, the Security Council approved the\r\nexpansion of the role of the United Nations Political\r\nOffice in Bougainville in monitoring and assisting in\r\nthe arms collection, storage and disposal, under the\r\nnew Bougainville Agreement.\r\nI am happy to report that the first and second\r\nstages of the arms disposal programme are progressing\r\nwell; however, more remains to be done.\r\nOur partners from Australia, New Zealand, the\r\nEuropean Union, Japan, and the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme continue to provide resources\r\nfor restoration and development work. A number of\r\nnon-governmental organizations, including churches\r\nand the Red Cross, have also been active.\r\nChanging the world from a system of relations\r\nbetween imperial Powers to a partnership between\r\nsovereign States through decolonization is among the\r\ngreatest achievements of the United Nations in the last\r\ncentury. The process will not be completed, as it must\r\nbe, until the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing\r\nTerritories have exercised their inalienable right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nOur Organization should continue to monitor\r\ndevelopments in New Caledonia, Tokelau and the other\r\n14 Non Self-Governing Territories on the United\r\nNations decolonization list, on a case-by-case basis.\r\nNeither small size nor remoteness nor population\r\ndensity should be allowed to qualify or limit the\r\nexercise of this inalienable right. The Pacific Islands\r\nForum Leaders’ Meeting, held last month in Fiji, once\r\nagain reaffirmed its support for this principle.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum Group, with the\r\nexception of Australia and New Zealand, comprises of\r\nsmall island countries that are custodians of the largest\r\nocean space. This ocean is rich in natural marine\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nresources. The countries of the region, however, have\r\nlimited human, financial and technological capacities\r\nto control, manage, and secure those resources for the\r\nbenefit of our current and future generations.\r\nThe recent Pacific Islands Forum adopted the\r\nPacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy, which aims to\r\nensure the future sustainable use of our oceans and\r\ntheir resources by our island communities and external\r\npartners.\r\nThe Pacific Islands peoples have not received\r\ntheir equitable share of the benefits resulting from the\r\ntapping of natural resources within their vast ocean\r\nspace. For example, statistics showed that, in the year\r\n2000, the value of fishery in the Central and Western\r\nPacific was in excess of $2.5 billion per annum, but the\r\nPacific countries earned a meagre $66 million in\r\nlicensing fees. This situation needs to be reviewed and\r\nchanged.\r\nMore than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans\r\nlive in rural villages, where they depend directly on the\r\nland, rivers, lakes and sea for their livelihood.\r\nOur National Constitution commits the nation to\r\nconserve, use, and develop the rich variety of the\r\ncountry’s natural resources for the common good and\r\nbenefit of future generations. Papua New Guinea has\r\ntherefore spoken out strongly and worked actively on a\r\nwide range of environmental issues.\r\nLike other members of the Pacific Islands Forum,\r\nPapua New Guinea is firmly committed to the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. We\r\nstrongly urge its full implementation.\r\nPapua New Guinea, together with other small\r\nisland developing States, continues to reiterate deep\r\nconcerns about the adverse impacts of climate change,\r\nclimate variability and sea-level rise, particularly with\r\nregard to the small, low-lying islands that are already\r\nexperiencing extreme hardships. We will therefore\r\ncontinue to stress the urgent need for the developed\r\ncountries to take a strong lead in the reductions of\r\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\r\nConsistent with this, Papua New Guinea has\r\nsigned and ratified both the United Nations Climate\r\nChange Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. We\r\nbelieve that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forward\r\nfor Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under\r\nthe Climate Change Convention. We urge those parties\r\nto translate their legally binding targets into concrete\r\nactions for the reduction of their gas emissions.\r\nWe welcome the support for the Kyoto Protocol\r\nby Japan, the European Union and, more recently,\r\nChina and Russia. We urge the United States and\r\nAustralia to join the global efforts towards addressing\r\nthis issue, including ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nPacific Forum island leaders also reiterated\r\ncontinuing serious concerns over the shipment of\r\nradioactive materials through the region. They called\r\non those States engaging in these activities to accept\r\nfull responsibility and liability for compensation for\r\nany damage that may result, directly or indirectly, from\r\nthe transport of radioactive material through the region.\r\nGlobal warming has brought an increase in the\r\nnumber of cases of diseases like malaria in the higher-\r\naltitude regions of our country. This is still a major\r\nthreat to Papua New Guinea, particularly in the most\r\npopulous region — the highlands.\r\nPapua New Guinea is not immune to the HIV/\r\nAIDS epidemic, and tuberculosis is again on the rise,\r\nso there is an urgent need to find preventative measures\r\nfor these diseases.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome announcements by the\r\nGovernments of Japan and the United States, among\r\nother, that they would set aside substantial financial\r\nresources for eradication programmes in developing\r\ncountries. Papua New Guinea concurs with the recent\r\ncalls by the international community to reform and\r\nrestructure the charters and mandates of the two\r\nBretton Woods institutions: the World Bank and the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund. These two institutions\r\nmust realign their policies and focus more on\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, rather than on\r\nthe reconstruction of economies.\r\nTheir lending policies should be made more\r\nlenient and flexible in assisting the developing\r\ncountries, including small islands, landlocked and the\r\nleast developed countries. The ultimate goal must be to\r\ntransfer resources into the hands of the needy, the\r\nmarginalized and the ostracized of society, so that they\r\ncan take pride in the ownership of the outcomes of new\r\ninitiatives taken in their own countries.\r\nThe way forward was agreed to under the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island States and Agenda 21\r\nand in the recent conferences on landlocked developing\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\ncountries and the Third United Nations Conference on\r\nthe Least Developed Countries in Brussels.\r\nI must however underline that to date, we have\r\nobserved a lack of effective implementation of both the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action and Agenda 21. There\r\nhas also been little or no increase in the international\r\naid and development assistance given to the developing\r\ncountries to build necessary infrastructure, human\r\nresource capacities, and other basic needs. This, in our\r\nhumble view, has to change if the developing countries,\r\nespecially the small island developing States,\r\nlandlocked and the least developed countries are to\r\nattain sustainable growth and development.\r\nThere is an urgent need to reform and restructure\r\nthe United Nations General Assembly and its\r\nsubsidiary bodies and agencies, as well as the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, so as to\r\nreflect the recent dynamics and changes.\r\nThe Security Council should be reformed and\r\nexpanded in both categories, permanent and non-\r\npermanent. It must take into account the interests of\r\nboth the developed and developing countries.\r\nAlthough we are encouraged by the general\r\npositive signs of progress towards resolving conflicts\r\nand securing peace in several regions of the world,\r\nPapua New Guinea remains concerned at the\r\ncontinuing conflict in the Middle East. We believe\r\nviolence will not resolve the conflict. We call on both\r\nIsrael and the Palestinian leadership to come to the\r\nnegotiating table to discuss outstanding issues with the\r\nview to resolving the conflict peacefully.\r\nIt would be remiss of me if I did not make\r\nmention of the fact that 11 September 2002 marked the\r\nfirst anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the United\r\nStates of America. The Government and people of\r\nPapua New Guinea express to the Government and\r\npeople of the United States, and the families of the\r\nvictims drawn from many countries, our sympathy for\r\nthe tragedy and suffering of just a year ago, when\r\nterrorism struck this great city of New York and\r\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.\r\nThough distant from this tragic event, we share in\r\nthe deep sorrow felt around the world, and in the\r\nadmiration of the extraordinary bravery and sacrifice of\r\nso many who engaged themselves in the rescue efforts.\r\nOur thoughts are with those who continue to mourn.\r\nPapua New Guinea joins with all the freedom\r\nloving nations and peoples of the world in condemning\r\nterrorism in all its evil forms. Terrorist attacks can\r\nnever be justified. Terrorism, in which the lives of the\r\nmost innocent and vulnerable are so senselessly taken,\r\nmust be especially condemned.\r\nPapua New Guinea fully endorses and supports\r\nall efforts towards the effective implementation of the\r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1373\r\n(2001).\r\nYou concluded your opening address to this\r\nAssembly, Mr. President, by appealing to Member\r\nStates to focus on what we have in common — and\r\nespecially our desire to live in a peaceful and secure\r\nworld where the values and principles expressed in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter are honoured. Papua New\r\nGuinea shares your vision and the confidence that\r\nunderpin your address.\r\nIf the nations of the world — with our great\r\ndiversity — focus on what we have in common, we\r\nwill build and secure a better world, one in which the\r\nbenefits of economic development are shared, and one\r\nin which the marvels of modern science and\r\ntechnology, including modern medicine, are harnessed\r\nfor the common good of humanity. But none of these\r\nthings can be achieved without a genuine and lasting\r\npeace.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm Papua New\r\nGuinea’s firm commitments to what I have outlined\r\nand reiterate that global, regional and local\r\npartnerships in promoting sustainable development is\r\nthe key to addressing the challenges that confront the\r\nworld today.\r\nThe President: I thank the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs and Immigration of Papua New Guinea for the\r\nstatement he has just made. I call on the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Yemen, His Excellency Mr. Abubakr\r\nAl-Qirbi.\r\nMr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): At the\r\noutset, I would like to express to you, Sir, our warmest\r\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\r\nthis session and to wish you every success conducting\r\nthe affairs of this session. Your ample diplomatic skills\r\nare well known. I wish also to thank your predecessor\r\nfor his good conduct of the preceding session. I also\r\nwish to extend my thanks to His Excellency the\r\nSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan for the quality of\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nthe report that he presented to us on the work of our\r\nOrganization and to wish him further success in the\r\ndischarge of his tasks.\r\nI am pleased in this connection to convey to you\r\nand all the participants in this session the greetings of\r\nHis Excellency President Abdullah Saleh of Yemen,\r\nand his sincere wish that the work of this session be\r\nhighly successful, particularly when it is convening\r\nunder grave and internationally important\r\ncircumstances.\r\nThis fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly of the United Nations is being held while the\r\nworld still vividly remembers the terrorist acts and the\r\ntragic and terrifying disaster, which befell the United\r\nStates on 11 September 2001 and which represented a\r\ngrave development in terrorist acts. This awakened the\r\ninternational community, requiring it to mobilize all its\r\npotential to face that threat to international peace and\r\nstability. The proliferation of international terrorism\r\nand the exorbitant price it has imposed on many\r\npeoples and States, including my country, has made\r\nfighting terrorism an obligation and a responsibility for\r\nsafeguarding peace, stability and development.\r\nMy country was among the first States to suffer\r\nfrom terrorism and its harmful repercussions still affect\r\nus. We have not hesitated to face that danger. Prior to\r\nthe September 2001 events, we drew the attention of\r\nthe international community to the need to unify efforts\r\nto combat terrorism and eradicate it before it took root.\r\nWhile doing its best to combat terrorism, my\r\ncountry has emphasized the need to convene an\r\ninternational conference on terrorism under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations so that we can reach a\r\nunified definition thereof. We emphasize the need to\r\ndistinguish between terrorism and the right of peoples\r\nto resist occupation. We need to end the causes that\r\ncreate a fertile climate for fostering terrorism.\r\nIsraeli violence and terrorism levelled against the\r\ndefenceless Palestinian people constitute a genuine\r\nobstacle to the achievement of a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace and create hotbeds of extremism\r\nand terrorism. Such violence impedes international\r\nefforts and initiatives to solve the Middle East\r\nquestion, while threatening stability, security and\r\nprosperity in the region. It also increases the incidence\r\nof violence and extremism and presages unpredictable\r\nconsequences. Consequently, the international\r\ncommunity must exert the utmost pressure on Israel to\r\nimplement Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\r\n338 (1973) and 1397 (2002), and General Assembly\r\nresolution 194 (III) of 1948 and to withdraw from all\r\noccupied Arab territories — Palestinian, Syrian and\r\nLebanese — and return to the 4 June 1967 borders. The\r\ninternational community must work towards\r\nestablishing a Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-\r\nSharif as its capital.\r\nWe reiterate our position that the Arab peace\r\ninitiative constitutes an integrated framework for the\r\nachievement of peace. Peace for Israel will not be\r\nachieved unless it withdraws from the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories, helps to re-establish the\r\nPalestinian security institutions and grants the\r\nPalestinian Authority control over its own territory.\r\nWe stress that the Palestinian people are solely\r\nresponsible for choosing their leadership and\r\nrepresentatives for negotiating a final settlement. In\r\nthis connection, we look forward to the outcome of the\r\nefforts led by the United States and the other members\r\nof the “quartet” to solve the Middle East question. We\r\nhope that the United States vision will be transformed\r\ninto a time-bound programme that will lay down\r\nguidelines to prevent Israel from circumventing any\r\nnew agreement, as it did those of Oslo, Camp David\r\nand Sharm el-Sheikh, through recent statements by\r\nSharon.\r\nSince the Republic of Yemen is interested in the\r\nsecurity and stability of the Middle East, we emphasize\r\nthe need for Israel to get rid of its nuclear arsenal and\r\nto subject its nuclear facilities to international\r\nsupervision. Israel should strive to free the Middle East\r\nregion of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe policy of imposing sanctions on some Arab\r\nand Islamic countries, Iraq in particular, should be\r\ntackled to ease the considerable harm done to the Iraqi\r\npeople. Here, I emphasize my country’s position that\r\nthe sanctions imposed on Iraq should be lifted. We\r\nreject the use of force against Iraq as long as it abides\r\nby international resolutions.\r\nYemen warns of the gravity of using force against\r\nIraq. We also warn of the disastrous consequences for\r\nthe region if force is used and if waging war takes\r\nprecedence over solving the problem peacefully. A\r\npeaceful approach, such as bringing back the inspectors\r\nand clearing up the doubts about Iraq’s possession of\r\nweapons of mass destruction, should be taken. We call\r\nfor the lifting of sanctions against Libya, Sudan and\r\n31\r\nA/57/PV.6\r\nCuba and for continuing dialogue as a means to\r\nachieve fair settlements, to safeguard the rights of the\r\nconcerned parties and to respect their sovereignty and\r\nsystems of government.\r\nBased on our interest in the situation in Somalia\r\nand our endeavours to achieve peace and stability\r\nthere, we call on the international community to\r\nintensify its efforts to bring peace to that country and\r\nto support the peace process led by the\r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, so as to\r\npreserve the security, territorial integrity and\r\nsovereignty of Somalia. We are ready to contribute to\r\nthis international political endeavour.\r\nMy country is of the view that current efforts to\r\nreform and restructure the United Nations, including\r\nSecurity Council reform, should enhance the\r\nOrganization’s role and achieve broader participation\r\nand more equitable representation in the Council, in\r\nkeeping with the principles of the sovereign equality of\r\nStates and equitable geographical distribution.\r\nYemen attaches great importance to the\r\nMillennium Declaration adopted during the Millennium\r\nSummit. It paves the way to new relations in the\r\ntwenty-first century; it calls for encouraging dialogue\r\namong civilizations and for the spread of the culture of\r\npeace; and it calls on richer States to shoulder their\r\nresponsibility towards least developed countries in\r\nfacing the challenges of poverty and deadly disease. In\r\nfact, we have not seen the implementation of any of\r\nthose principles. We therefore call upon States to abide\r\nby the Millennium Declaration and implement it in\r\norder to engender better relations between the rich and\r\nthe poor; to remove the spectre of the clash of\r\ncivilizations and races; to enhance the high principles\r\nand values of religions; and to remove the distorted\r\nview of the tolerant Islamic religion that has been\r\npropagated by others.\r\nThe developing countries are suffering from\r\ndifficult economic conditions due to poverty,\r\nunemployment, declining living standards, over-\r\npopulation, mismanagement, debt servicing, and so\r\nforth, in addition to the burdens imposed by new\r\neconomic policies. For these States to be fully\r\nintegrated into the international economy, they need\r\nnew opportunities and support so that they can build\r\ntheir economies and carry out administrative and\r\neconomic structural reforms. They need further\r\nfinancial assistance and opportunities to compete, as\r\nwell as technology transfers on concessional terms.\r\nThey should also benefit from investments and\r\ncooperation, and free trade zones need to be\r\nestablished. We should try to implement the\r\nrecommendations of the Third United Nations\r\nConference on the Least Developed Countries and\r\ncancel the accumulated debts of those countries.\r\nMy Government is making strenuous efforts to\r\nachieve full development, to complete the building of\r\nan infrastructure, and to eliminate poverty. Thus, we\r\nhave implemented a programme of administrative,\r\nfinancial and economic reform, and have updated the\r\ninvestment law to attract foreign capital, with a view to\r\nbolstering the service and economic sectors. We have\r\nbegun a carefully prepared and well balanced\r\nprivatization programme and are making efforts to join\r\nthe World Trade Organization and integrate ourselves\r\ninto world economy.\r\nAt this session, we look forward to the adoption\r\nof important resolutions that will enhance our joint\r\ncampaign to achieve security and stability, welfare and\r\nprosperity for our peoples. I am confident that our\r\nconcerted efforts will lead to the success of this session\r\nand will help us achieve the results we desire.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to extend my\r\ncongratulations to Switzerland on its admission as a\r\nMember of the Organization and to Timor-Leste on its\r\ncoming admission. They will make a fresh contribution\r\nto the United Nations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.\r\n"
