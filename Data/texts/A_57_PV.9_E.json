(Czech Republic)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3:05 p.m.\r\nItem 9 of the provisional agenda (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Louis Michel, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Belgium.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): Some\r\n50 years ago my predecessor Paul-Henri Spaak said\r\nbefore the Assembly, in a phrase that stands out in our\r\nminds, “We are afraid”. At that time, totalitarianism\r\nthreatened democratic freedoms and our open society\r\nwas in danger. Fortunately, political and diplomatic\r\ndialogue gradually won out over confrontation, mutual\r\nthreats and force. The advent of a freer world, more\r\nunited and more respectful of everyone is finally within\r\nour grasp. After September 2001, all democratic forces\r\nthroughout the world felt a moment of fear, terror,\r\nconfusion and horror at the barbaric violence that\r\nsmashed their strongest beliefs into pieces. That\r\nirrational hatred threatened the same democratic\r\nvalues, fundamental freedoms and humanistic world\r\noutlook.\r\nThe free world came together with a sense of\r\nsolidarity, compassion and survival. A coalition against\r\nthat vile crime stood side by side with the people of the\r\nUnited States. We felt it was our duty; we felt that their\r\nsuffering was our suffering and that their cause was\r\nalso our cause. We could not permit there to be any\r\ndoubt in the minds of the enemies of our shared values;\r\nwe could not leave any scope for those who sought to\r\nbreak the promise of a world of justice, progress and\r\npeace.\r\nToday we must move beyond fear. Our response\r\nmust be guided by clear-minded analysis and rational\r\naction. The enemy is faceless but is not everywhere.\r\nWe all are now constantly vigilant, but must not reach\r\nthe point of being unable to look one another in the eye\r\nwithout mistrust or suspicion. We are in an infinitely\r\ngreat majority; only an infinitesimal minority is against\r\nus. We cannot simply reduce the entire world to a\r\nbattlefield. We cannot simply make a division between\r\ngood and evil. To build a wall would be to fall into the\r\ntrap of those who openly display their hate and\r\nintolerance. Instead, more than ever we must realize\r\nthat the source of wealth and hope in the world is\r\nprecisely its great diversity and pluralism.\r\nThe struggle against terrorism must, of course, be\r\nbased on effective methods with no room for laxity. I\r\nwant to make this point very strongly: fighting\r\nterrorism must not lead us to distort the nature of\r\ndemocratic tolerant life or respect for the rule of law.\r\nPreserving our concept of a pluralist, open and tolerant\r\nsociety must be our goal. We cannot be misled or\r\naccept distortions of our firm belief in the fundamental\r\nhuman rights and the rights of peoples. Combating\r\nterrorism also means, above all, that we must defend\r\nthe fundamental rights and legal protections of every\r\nman and woman. We have a humanist conviction and\r\nwe must defend it, because otherwise we would be\r\nceding victory to the terrorists. It would also be a\r\n2\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nmistake to believe that the fight against terrorism can\r\nbe won by military means alone. Military means are\r\nadmittedly necessary, but are not themselves enough to\r\nput an end to this horrible phenomenon.\r\nThere is absolutely nothing that can justify\r\nterrorism. No cause can justify terror. I categorically\r\nand definitively reject the idea that we have to look to\r\nthe inequities of the world for the source of this\r\nperversion of the mind and soul. In my view, that\r\nwould mitigate this abominable act. The origin of the\r\nattack cannot be found there. However, we also know\r\nthat misery, injustice, poverty, exclusion and\r\nhumiliation create fertile ground for extremism,\r\nintolerance and hatred to flourish by taking advantage\r\nof the hopelessness and suffering of those left behind\r\nby a society too quickly satisfied by its clear\r\nconscience.\r\nWhy should we deny it? As our Prime Minister\r\nGuy Verhofstadt has said, in less than a year we have\r\nfocused at least four times on the challenges facing the\r\nworld: at Doha, Monterrey, Rome and Johannesburg.\r\nThe elimination of poverty, debt reduction and\r\nliberalization of international trade as a factor for\r\ndevelopment are all questions that have been\r\nrepeatedly discussed. We all come to the same\r\nconclusions. We identify the same causes. I am certain\r\nthat we all know the solutions that must be applied.\r\nWith such unanimity, it should be easy to put an\r\nend to inequality. It should be easy to bring together a\r\nworld which for too long has been cut in two, a world\r\nthat generates tensions and frustrations. There cannot\r\nand should not be a superficial division at the margin\r\nof our wealth. We need a loftier conception of\r\ncooperation, one that derives not from paternalism but\r\nrather from partnership and mutual respect.\r\nPutting an end to inequality and forging a new\r\nsolidarity is the way to ensure sustainable development\r\nfor future generations. At each of our summits, the rich\r\nworld has raised the hopes of the millions of indigent\r\npeople who are searching for a glimmer of light in the\r\ndarkness. However, each time, at the end of these grand\r\nmeetings, when the speeches are over, when those who\r\nadvocate on behalf of the poor have stopped their\r\nritualistic pleadings, poverty remains in place. One gets\r\nthe impression that we have offered those who\r\nexpected so much of us only empty rhetoric and\r\nposturing.\r\nThe Millennium Goals must become a benchmark\r\nfor all the work of the United Nations and for that of\r\neach of its Member States. We have to translate them\r\ninto financial tools and into access to markets and\r\ntechnology. At Monterrey, my country pledged to reach\r\nthe target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for\r\ndevelopment cooperation by 2010. We have offered,\r\nfurthermore, new initiatives on the debt burden.\r\nI also attach paramount importance to follow-up\r\nof the Durban Conference against racism, and to the\r\nimplementation of the Durban Programme of Action.\r\nCombating racism, discrimination and intolerance is\r\nabsolutely essential for the millions of human beings\r\nwho have often silently suffered from infringements on\r\ntheir dignity. I stress the historic importance of the\r\nagreement on the origins and causes of racism. It forms\r\nthe basis of a new partnership. Unless we recognize\r\npast injustices, we will not have a solid basis for future\r\nefforts.\r\nAnother challenge that we wish to address is to\r\nattain absolute gender equality. This is absolutely\r\nessential in a civilization of progress, in which our\r\nideals of democracy and humanism are realized. The\r\nSecretary-General and his team, including his Deputy,\r\nLouise Fréchette, can count on my country’s\r\ncommitment and support for all the reforms under way.\r\nWe must revitalize the General Assembly, continue the\r\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council,\r\nexpand the Security Council and carry out\r\norganizational reforms. I know that the United Nations\r\nwill take up these challenges.\r\nThe outstanding and far-sighted speech made by\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan rightly, skilfully and\r\nresolutely reminded us what, in the final analysis, is the\r\nmeaning of the world government and parliament. He\r\nmade his statement very convincingly and intelligently.\r\nWe share his view on reshaping our Organization so\r\nthat it can live up to our ambitions.\r\nMy country was at the forefront of combating\r\nimpunity for the most serious crimes and for the rapid\r\ndevelopment of a true international criminal justice.\r\nThat is why we continue to support the\r\ninternationalization of the Rome Statute, and why we\r\nare resolved to preserve its integrity. Admittedly, we\r\nknow that the dialogue is never easy when law interacts\r\nwith politics, but we are convinced that in the long-\r\nterm, nothing will block society’s right to demand\r\njustice when the most serious crimes against\r\n3\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nfundamental values are committed. States have primary\r\nresponsibility for prosecuting the crimes covered in the\r\nStatute of the Court. We urge the world community,\r\nincluding the most powerful among us, to give the\r\nCourt credibility and resources commensurate with its\r\nlofty mission.\r\nConflict prevention is one of my country’s\r\nforeign policy priorities. We are engaged concretely in\r\npreventive diplomacy, particularly in Central Africa,\r\nwhere Belgium is proactively supportive of the Lusaka\r\nand Arusha peace processes. Belgium actively\r\nadvocates this approach within the European Union.\r\nBelgium is seeking to make this concept of conflict\r\nprevention, conflict management and post-conflict\r\nsupport an essential part of international doctrine. We\r\nneed standing monitoring and warning mechanisms to\r\nalert us in time to crises. Such mechanisms could spare\r\nthe lives of many people. For similar reasons, we need\r\nto develop a real strategy against the illegal financing\r\nof conflicts and the related illegal trade in natural\r\nresources. The sordid exploitation of such resources —\r\nfor instance, conflict diamonds — too often contributes\r\nto finance or at least prolong regional tragedies such as\r\ncivil wars and inter-ethnic conflicts.\r\nTo face this challenge, a credible international\r\nmonitoring system, based on common standards, has to\r\nbe established. Substantial improvements must be\r\nmade in the functioning of the various sanctions\r\ncommittees, and we believe that a single monitoring\r\nbody, with a long-term mandate, should be set up.\r\nAfrica is at the centre of our concerns, but also of\r\nour hopes. The creation of the African Union during\r\nthe Durban summit of the Organization of African\r\nUnity, along with the dynamic of the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), are major steps\r\nforward taken in recent months. The strengthening of\r\ndemocracy and the recent successful elections in Africa\r\nare an encouraging sign. The prospects for Africa also\r\ninclude regional integration of African countries,\r\nwhich we encourage. We can see some positive but still\r\nfragile signs with regard to reconciliation in countries\r\nthat have been too long devastated by conflicts, such as\r\nthe Great Lakes region, Angola and the Sudan.\r\nFurther efforts have been made this year to find a\r\nsolution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo. The inter-Congolese dialogue has led, first,\r\nto the signing of a partial agreement at Sun City, which\r\ncreated a dynamic of reconciliation, thanks to the\r\nefforts of South Africa, to which I pay tribute here. The\r\nPretoria Agreement addresses the main causes of the\r\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: its\r\nterritorial integrity and the security concerns of\r\nRwanda. The United Nations Organization Mission in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has a crucial\r\npart to play in ensuring implementation of the\r\nAgreement, with its operation to disarm and demobilize\r\nthe armed groups.\r\nI urge Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo to take advantage of this opportunity to\r\nrestore to their peoples the peace and prosperity they\r\ndeserve. I would also like to pay tribute to the Special\r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Niasse, for\r\nbringing all the Congolese parties to the negotiating\r\ntable with a view to arriving at a democratic, inclusive\r\nagreement.\r\nThrough the many meetings I have attended in the\r\nregion, I have become acquainted with Congolese\r\npolitical figures. I know that they have the will, the\r\nauthority, the competence and the grasp of history to\r\nrealize the dream of peace and prosperity of a\r\npopulation which has suffered for too long.\r\nI should like also to pay tribute to the South\r\nAfrican and Tanzanian mediation in the context of\r\nnegotiations for a ceasefire in Burundi. Despite the\r\nprogress made, there has been a resumption of violence\r\nthat could undermine the gains recorded in the Arusha\r\nprocess — so ably facilitated by the political and moral\r\nauthority of President Nelson Mandela. I would also\r\nurgently appeal to all international partners to consider\r\nwhich concrete steps should be taken to help Burundi\r\nemerge from its political, economic and social crisis.\r\nThe difficulties prevailing in this area are without a\r\ndoubt complicating the political solution.\r\nAnother area in need of structural stability is the\r\nMiddle East. Men, women, mothers, fathers, children\r\nall are suffering on a daily basis from the violence, and\r\nfor this reason we must reaffirm those principles that\r\nwill enable us to find a lasting and equitable solution:\r\nland for peace, a viable Palestinian State and security\r\nfor Israel. Rather than going beyond the gains made\r\nthrough Oslo and Madrid, we should enshrine and\r\nreconfirm them by translating them into reality. This is\r\nwhat the European Union has sought to do by drawing\r\nup a road map setting out the actions to be taken by the\r\nparties concerned with a view to achieving a\r\ncomprehensive and lasting solution.\r\n4\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nLastly, let me ask a question that I think is of\r\nglobal significance. The question of Iraq is a challenge\r\nto all of us, because it involves questions at several\r\ndifferent levels: the need to eliminate a major threat to\r\nthe international community; the need to ensure the\r\ncredibility of our Organization; the need to determine\r\nwhether a country has weapons of mass destruction that\r\ncan bring death to millions of people; the need to\r\ndetermine if a country is failing to meet its obligations\r\nto the United Nations; and the need to know if a\r\npreventive unilateral military action is or is not a\r\ndoctrinal problem under international law.\r\nAll of these questions are core issues with respect\r\nto our Organization, its missions and its individual and\r\ncollective political responsibilities.\r\nI wish to recall that each and every one of us, in\r\nsigning the Charter of the United Nations, solemnly\r\nundertook to comply with that Charter. Therefore, on\r\nbehalf of my country and of its citizens, I wish to make\r\na clear appeal to Iraq. I formally and solemnly ask the\r\nIraqi authorities to implement urgently and\r\nunconditionally the resolutions adopted by the United\r\nNations. Respect for our Organization and respect for\r\nwhat we are, collectively and individually, is the only\r\nway of avoiding recourse to force. I ask the Iraqi\r\nauthorities to seize this last opportunity.\r\nAll of these challenges require a united,\r\nmultilateral reaction in a spirit of solidarity. The world\r\nis a village now, but too often we are rather narrow-\r\nminded and do not listen to one another. Sometimes the\r\nother is seen as a stranger or even an intruder. Human\r\ncivilizations must learn more about one another in\r\norder to live together in harmony.\r\nThe citizens of the world have different\r\nperspectives on life, on religion, on the way they\r\norganize their society, on the past and the future. But\r\nthey all dream of justice, happiness and equality. Often\r\nthey dream the same dream, but the path to\r\nimplementing that dream sometimes varies. Respecting\r\nothers even though they are different will help us move\r\ntowards a more harmonious world. This is what we, as\r\npolitical leaders, have a responsibility to do, in order to\r\nbroaden day after day the common area of the values\r\nthat we share.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Somsavat Lengsavad, Deputy Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): On behalf of the delegation of Laos, I would\r\nlike, Sir, to convey to you my congratulations on your\r\nelection to the presidency of this fifty-seventh session\r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nThe current session is taking place at a time when\r\nMember States have entered the third year of the\r\nprocess of implementation of the Development Goals\r\nadopted at the Millennium Summit. During the past\r\ntwo years, satisfactory progress has been made towards\r\nthose objectives, yet much more needs to be done. It is\r\nour view that the war on poverty deserves our greatest\r\nattention, for poverty causes millions of deaths and\r\ndoes not allow for sustainable development.\r\nFurthermore, our planet is facing the scourge of\r\nterrorism in its various forms. Our Government will\r\nwork in a spirit of solidarity with the world community\r\nin the combat against that scourge.\r\nSince the end of the twentieth century, it has been\r\nwidely claimed that globalization provides tremendous\r\neconomic and development opportunities to nations.\r\nHowever, it is evident that it has also brought\r\nnumerous challenges to the majority of the world’s\r\npopulation, in particular to those people living in\r\ndeveloping countries. The most notable effects of\r\nglobalization can be seen in the fact that the disparity\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries\r\ncontinues to increase.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, while the developing\r\ncountries, with a sense of ownership and partnership,\r\nhave adopted various measures to cope with its\r\ndisadvantages, they still find themselves confronted\r\nwith the problem of securing financing and human\r\nresources that can handle new technology; added to\r\nthis is the inability to access the market of the\r\ndeveloped countries. Although the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and other\r\ninternational conferences have given rise to some hope\r\nthat these disadvantages and challenges will be\r\naddressed, the results have been far from satisfactory.\r\nMoreover, the World Summit held in\r\nJohannesburg earlier this month failed to respond to the\r\nstrong aspirations of the developing countries and of\r\nthe world community in addressing the issue of\r\nsustainable development. Only by implementing the\r\ncommitments and pledges adopted at those\r\ninternational conferences can we ensure fair and\r\n5\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nsustainable development and lasting peace for\r\nhumankind.\r\nWe continue to seek a world of peace,\r\ncoexistence and cooperation for development.\r\nHowever, to our regret, violent disputes and conflicts\r\ncontinue to rage in many parts of our planet due to the\r\nlegacies of history and other factors.\r\nWe are again gathered here in the conviction that\r\nthe United Nations, as the only truly universal\r\nOrganization, should have a greater responsibility and\r\na more important role to play, in accordance with\r\nCharter and international law, in resolving various\r\ndisputes in the world and in preventing the emergence\r\nof new hot spots and interference in the internal affairs\r\nof independent and sovereign States.\r\nWe should also continue to call for reform of the\r\nUnited Nations with a view to enabling it to rise to the\r\nformidable challenge of poverty eradication and the\r\npromotion of sustainable development. In particular,\r\nthe Security Council should be reformed so as to\r\nensure that it fulfils its responsibilities in safeguarding\r\npeace and security. In this context, I would like to pay\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who has\r\nworked tirelessly to render our Organization more\r\neffective, and wish him even greater success in his\r\nendeavours.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic shares the\r\ninternational community’s deep concern about the\r\nexcessive use of force in the Middle East since March\r\nthis year. In conformity with the common position of\r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement on the Middle East peace\r\nprocess, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nbelieves that only a politically negotiated settlement\r\nacceptable to both parties and implemented under\r\ninternational supervision will bring peace, stability and\r\ncooperation to the region. Such a settlement must be\r\nbased on respect for the inalienable rights of the\r\nPalestinian people to establish an independent and\r\nviable State of their own, so that they can live side by\r\nside with Israel in peace and security within\r\ninternationally recognized borders, in accordance with\r\nall relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic also\r\nexpresses great concern about the issue of Iraq — an\r\nindependent and sovereign nation, and a State Member\r\nof the United Nations. We are of the view that this\r\nissue should be resolved by the United Nations through\r\npolitical means.\r\nWith regard to the Caribbean region, the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic reiterates its call for the\r\nlifting of the economic, financial and trade embargo\r\nimposed against the Republic of Cuba by the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America. An end\r\nto this long-standing and obsolete policy would not\r\nonly mean effective compliance with various General\r\nAssembly resolutions, international law and the current\r\nworld thinking, but also promote economic prosperity\r\nand cooperation in the region as a whole.\r\nWith regard to the Korean Peninsula, the Lao\r\nGovernment welcomes the recent positive\r\ndevelopments, especially the inter-Korean ministerial\r\ntalks, as well as the preparation for negotiations\r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,\r\nthe United States of America and Japan. These\r\ndevelopments will help pave the way for the\r\nachievement of the goal of the peaceful national\r\nreunification of Korea, and significantly contribute to\r\nthe consolidation of peace and stability in East Asia\r\nand the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nWhile many other countries are taking advantage\r\nof the benefits offered by globalization, the landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries are still marginalized due to their\r\ngeographical disadvantage. Their lack of territorial\r\naccess to the sea, and their remoteness and isolation\r\nfrom major international markets, as well as the high\r\ntransit transport costs, continue to be major obstacles\r\nfor those countries in meeting objectives of national\r\neconomic development and poverty eradication.\r\nMoreover, this geographical handicap deprives us of\r\nour right to be competitive in the international trading\r\nsystem and to fully benefit from it. As the country\r\nholding the chairmanship of the Group of Landlocked\r\nDeveloping Countries, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic expresses its appreciation to the General\r\nAssembly for its decision, taken last year, to convene\r\nin 2003 an International Ministerial Meeting of\r\nLandlocked and Transit Developing Countries and\r\nDonor Countries and International Financial and\r\nDevelopmental Institutions on Transit Transport\r\nCooperation.\r\nOver the past year, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic has recorded a number of important\r\nachievements in the field of socio-economic\r\ndevelopment. One event of significance was the\r\nsuccessful election of the fifth National Assembly on\r\n24 February this year. This has contributed to the\r\ngradual improvement of living standards of the Lao\r\n6\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\npeople across all ethnic groups and ensured and\r\nstrengthened political stability and social order.\r\nWhile extending its cooperation to the\r\ninternational community in many spheres, the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic has contributed to the\r\nstrengthening of Asian solidarity and to the cause of\r\npeace, friendship, cooperation and development for\r\nnations throughout the world.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Vartan Oskanian, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nArmenia.\r\nMr. Oskanian (Armenia): I would like to begin\r\nby congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh\r\nsession, and to wish you success in your work. I would\r\nalso like to thank Mr. Han Seung-soo for having so\r\nably conducted the work of the fifty-sixth session.\r\nIt is with special pleasure that I welcome the\r\nadmission of the Swiss Confederation to the United\r\nNations. That we have the pleasure and the opportunity\r\nto welcome such a new Member — a long-standing\r\ndemocracy which has only recently chosen to enter this\r\nforum — is continuing testimony to the vitality,\r\nviability and relevance of this unique body.\r\nThis time last year, new States and old were\r\nthunderstruck by a terror that is still indescribable. We\r\nwere reeling from the enormity of what terrorism had\r\nwrought, even as we sought to understand why it had\r\nhappened. Millenniums of experience of the\r\ndevastation of war had not provided us with the tools\r\nnecessary to understand that new form of combat.\r\nToday, a year later, as we persevere with the\r\narduous endeavour to eradicate the affliction, we also\r\ncontinue to search for causes. We distinguish, certainly,\r\nbetween comprehending and concurring, awareness and\r\nacquiescence, understanding and justification. At the\r\nsame time, we recognize that diagnosis does not always\r\nresult in a cure.\r\nWe cannot go back to where we were a year ago,\r\neither in our assumptions or in our actions. The\r\nfundamental question we must all answer is: what is it\r\nthat we can and cannot, should and should not, do to\r\nother human beings? The answer must include a\r\nrejection of flagrant injustice and abject poverty. That\r\nwould go a long way towards alleviating the\r\nhopelessness that perpetuates such societal ills.\r\nBearing that in mind, we welcome the targets and\r\ntimetables adopted to spur action on a wide range of\r\nissues at the recently concluded World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. Critical among those goals\r\nis the need to provide and manage water as a basic\r\nelement of life and a basic requirement for dignified\r\nliving. Without that, neither economic nor political\r\nstability is possible. The other two major United\r\nNations events of this year — the International\r\nConference on Financing for Development and the\r\nspecial Assembly session on children — also\r\ndemonstrate that social and economic development\r\nmust be tackled in tandem in order to attain global\r\npeace and security.\r\nIn Armenia, too, we are focusing on both aspects\r\nof development. The Armenian Government’s poverty\r\nreduction strategy aims to establish an umbrella for the\r\nformulation and implementation of sustainable human\r\ndevelopment strategies in areas damaged by\r\nearthquakes and conflict. We shall do that by building\r\ndomestic capacities for governance and by restoring\r\nsocial services in education and health, agricultural\r\ndevelopment, reforestation and disaster preparedness.\r\nArmenia’s response to the very special session on\r\nchildren is the elaboration and implementation of its\r\nNational Plan of Action for Children. The National\r\nPlan of Action sets 10-year goals for the protection of\r\nthe rights of the child, outlines principal strategies, and\r\nestablishes indicators and mechanisms for monitoring\r\nprogress towards the enumerated goals.\r\nThe past decades of summits and forums on the\r\nvariety of social and economic ills that face modern\r\nsocieties have amply demonstrated that committed\r\npartnerships are necessary for serious progress. At\r\nhome, Government and civil society must work\r\ntogether to implement the decisions of such forums,\r\nbut, at the global level, Governments and international\r\nagencies must also provide the resources and impetus\r\nfor their universal agendas.\r\nEconomic prosperity hinges on internal, regional\r\nand international stability. That stability, in turn,\r\ndepends on cooperation and goodwill. In our region,\r\ndespite the existence of various conflicts, we continue\r\nto be hopeful that democratic processes will create civil\r\nsocieties with responsible leaders committed to the\r\nresolution of political issues.\r\nIn Armenia, we look forward to a year of\r\nelections: presidential elections — the fourth held since\r\n7\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nindependence — will be followed by parliamentary\r\nelections, which in turn will be followed by a\r\nreferendum on constitutional reforms. We are proud\r\nthat we have had a working Constitution for more than\r\nseven years, and that that Constitution has seen us\r\nthrough difficult periods without leading to domestic\r\nturmoil. Nevertheless, we recognize the need — as in\r\nany evolving society — to make some changes in order\r\nto reflect more accurately our commitment to\r\nbecoming a society that respects the rule of law and the\r\nrights of individuals.\r\nWe are equally proud that the Armenians of\r\nNagorny-Karabakh, in the midst of their ongoing\r\nstruggle for self-determination, have also completed\r\nanother presidential election cycle. Indeed, the people\r\nof Nagorny-Karabakh deserve to be commended for\r\nestablishing the rule of law despite continuing adverse\r\nsocial and economic conditions.\r\nAs the Organization for Security and Cooperation\r\nin Europe (OSCE) and the Co-Chairmen of its Minsk\r\nGroup continue to work with Armenia, Azerbaijan and\r\nNagorny-Karabakh towards a settlement that will\r\nwisely — i.e. with an eye to the realities on the\r\nground — determine Nagorny-Karabakh’s final status,\r\nit is self-evident that only a democratically elected\r\nleadership that enjoys a popular mandate will be able\r\nto participate actively and legitimately in the final\r\nnegotiations that affect the status of its own people.\r\nWith that in mind, in 1992, at the Helsinki Meeting of\r\nthe Council of Ministers of the Conference on Security\r\nand Cooperation in Europe, it was decided that elected\r\nand other representatives of Nagorny-Karabakh would\r\nbe invited to the Minsk Conference, entrusted with\r\ndetermining the final status of Nagorny-Karabakh.\r\nTherefore, while elections and democratization\r\ndo not presume a particular status, self-determination is\r\nalways more legitimate when accompanied by\r\ndemocratic processes. The international community\r\nseems to understand, often welcomes and sometimes\r\nassists in electoral democratic processes in areas whose\r\ninternational legal status is still in flux and ostensibly\r\nsubject to the sovereignty of an existing State. We do\r\nnot understand why such wise and non-prejudicial\r\napproaches or strategies should be denied to Nagorny-\r\nKarabakh, where de facto self-rule has already been in\r\nplace for almost 10 years.\r\nDemocratization and self-determination become\r\nboth necessary and inevitable when the formation of a\r\nnew independent entity takes place inside States that\r\nare deficient in democracy and whose respect for\r\nhuman rights and application of United Nations\r\nprinciples is unsatisfactory. Nothing demonstrates that\r\nfact more than East Timor’s forthcoming membership\r\nin this body. So it is with pleasure that we express to\r\nthat country the heartfelt congratulations of the\r\nArmenian Government. East Timor’s coming\r\nmembership is proof that a blanket rejection of claims\r\nto self-determination is invalid and does not take into\r\naccount the very real fact that such movements are not,\r\nby their nature, all alike or even similar. Different\r\nstruggles for self-determination have evolved in\r\ndecidedly different ways; therefore, each has to be\r\ntreated differently.\r\nThe challenge for the international community\r\ncontinues to be to adopt policies that will contribute to\r\nthe peaceful solution of each conflict. In order to adopt\r\ncorrect policies, criteria must be established by which\r\nto evaluate and judge each case on its own merit,\r\nrealistically taking into account the real situation on the\r\nground in order to attain lasting peace.\r\nThat peace is what the people of Nagorny-\r\nKarabakh and the whole region are still waiting for,\r\nand one would think that it is also what the leadership\r\nof Azerbaijan want. Based on the very hopeful\r\nmeetings that are taking place between the Presidents\r\nof Armenia and Azerbaijan, we have reasons to be\r\npositive. However, having followed the comments that\r\nmy colleague from Azerbaijan made this morning from\r\nthis podium, I am not only shocked but also dismayed\r\nthat he is not keeping pace with the progress being\r\nmade in the region by the Presidents of both our\r\ncountries.\r\nIt has been two years since the meetings at Paris\r\nand Key West, where the international community put\r\nforth their views on this issue. Since then, some\r\nAzerbaijani officials, out of desperation or ignorance,\r\nhave used every means at their disposal to discredit the\r\ninitiatives of the international community, looking for\r\nways to artificially link them to the critical issues of\r\nthe day.\r\nAfter 11 September, the talk of the threat of\r\ninternational terrorism caused Azerbaijan to make\r\naccusations that went full circle in damaging its own\r\nreputation when, according to Western sources,\r\nAzerbaijan’s own 10-year-long relationship with\r\nterrorists came to the surface and it was demonstrated\r\n8\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nthat Azerbaijan had indeed served as a regional\r\nterrorist hub. So that did not work. Today, as the\r\ninternational community speaks of countries’\r\nresponsibilities under Security Council resolutions,\r\nAzerbaijan frivolously makes the same accusation\r\nagainst Armenia, without considering that Armenia has\r\ndone exactly what the international community\r\nexpected: it has used its good offices, with the\r\nleadership of Nagorny-Karabakh, to help find a\r\npeaceful solution to the conflict.\r\nAzerbaijan has a choice: continue with crude\r\ndelusional manipulation and naive wishful thinking and\r\nhope for a return to a historical military and political\r\nsituation that ended long ago, or join the international\r\ncommunity, through the good offices of the Co-\r\nChairmen of the OSCE’s Minsk Group, in order to\r\ncontinue in the difficult search for peace. The people\r\non the ground on all sides have demonstrated their\r\nreadiness for peace and for political and economic\r\nstability. Leaders at the highest level are maintaining\r\nthe honest dialogue that will chip away at political\r\nobstacles. We who are entrusted with transforming\r\nthose efforts and desires into a just peace must\r\napproach our task honestly and responsibly.\r\nLet me say that Nagorny-Karabakh has never,\r\never been a part of independent Azerbaijan. Whether\r\nwe consider history or geography, whether we adopt a\r\nlong-term political perspective or face the reality of the\r\nfacts on the ground, the men, women and children of\r\nNagorny-Karabakh have earned the right to live\r\npeacefully on their historic lands.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nPresident Kocharian’s statement before the General\r\nAssembly two years ago with respect to working for\r\nthe recognition of the Armenian genocide and\r\npreventing the repetition of such an atrocity. We extend\r\nour profound appreciation to all those Governments,\r\nlegislatures and international bodies that have\r\nrecognized the Armenian genocide and pledge our\r\ncooperation to all those that are currently in the process\r\nof reaffirming the facts of that crime against humanity.\r\nAs a signatory of the Convention on the Prevention and\r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Armenian\r\nGovernment places a high priority on the struggle to\r\nprevent future genocide and to stand up against all\r\nattempts to deny past genocide. We support all\r\ninitiatives that reinforce the international consensus\r\nbehind that landmark treaty.\r\nIt is becoming clear that this millennium, too,\r\nwill not be violence-free. Today, when global peace\r\nappears a distant hope, Armenia observes the volatility\r\nin the Caucasus, the Middle East and elsewhere with\r\ntrepidation. To face such challenges, Armenia supports\r\nproposals by the Secretary-General aimed at the\r\nstrengthening of the Organization so that it can face\r\nnew challenges in a more satisfactory way.\r\nAdditionally, Armenia is in favour of more equitable\r\nrepresentation on the Security Council, as well as more\r\ntransparency in its activities.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East, in Afghanistan\r\nand around Iraq remains a continuing example of the\r\nneed for a vibrant and strengthened United Nations\r\nable to assert the will of the Organization’s\r\nmembership and empowered with greater authority to\r\nimplement its decisions.\r\nAs States and Governments continue to search for\r\nnew ways to deal with emerging internal conflicts and\r\nincreasingly complex interrelationships, Armenia is of\r\nthe belief that the United Nations must stand for all the\r\neasy-to-orate but difficult-to-deliver principles of\r\neconomic and political justice and equality among\r\npeoples. Given our uneven history and problematic\r\ngeography, it is no surprise that Armenia is an advocate\r\nof multilateralism and collective security. From the\r\nvantage point of a country with our resources and\r\nlimitations, we realize that peace is not possible\r\nwithout social justice, sustainable development and\r\nrespect for the rights of all individuals and peoples in\r\nthe community of nations.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Marwan Muasher, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Jordan.\r\nMr. Muasher (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I wish\r\nat the outset to extend to you, Sir, and to your friendly\r\ncountry, the Czech Republic, warm congratulations on\r\nyour election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. Your record of\r\nprudence and diplomatic skill will certainly be\r\ninstrumental in meeting the lofty goals sought by all\r\nnations and peoples. A word of thanks and tribute goes\r\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han\r\nSeung-soo, for his outstanding stewardship of the fifty-\r\nsixth session.\r\nTwo States are being admitted to the membership\r\nof our Organization: the Swiss Confederation and,\r\nsoon, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. Despite\r\n9\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\ntheir differing histories, each will strengthen the fabric\r\nand enrich the tapestry of the United Nations. Jordan\r\nbids a warm welcome to both of them and wishes them\r\nwell.\r\nThe opening of the current session coincided with\r\nthe first anniversary of the heinous terrorist attacks\r\nagainst New York City, Washington, D.C., and\r\nPennsylvania. As I reiterate Jordan’s condemnation of\r\nthose terrorist acts, let me express once again our deep\r\ncondolences and sympathy to the families of the\r\nthousands of victims who lost their lives as a result of\r\nthe cowardly and criminal acts that targeted our\r\nOrganization’s host city and host nation. The list of\r\nvictims is multinational, multi-ethnic, multi-religious\r\nand multicultural. That graphically illustrates the fact\r\nthat terrorism is indeed blind to all those criteria. The\r\ninternational community rose to the occasion when it\r\nprovided a prompt, collective, decisive response.\r\nIndeed, it was the United Nations itself that provided\r\nthe forum for a global coalition underpinned by both\r\nour common political will and the compelling case\r\nbefore us. Thus, the Assembly adopted resolution 56/1,\r\nwhile the Security Council adopted its resolutions 1368\r\n(2001) and 1373 (2001). That set of decisions,\r\nembraced by our world body, which represents all\r\nhuman cultures, ideologies and ethnicities, created the\r\nofficial platform for launching the ongoing global\r\ncampaign against terrorism.\r\nMy country, Jordan, has also suffered from\r\nterrorism and its evils. Terrorists have struck at our\r\nnational symbols, our citizens and our interests because\r\nof our principled positions, foremost among them our\r\nfirm commitment to fight terrorism. All along, Jordan\r\nhas been in the vanguard of every international effort\r\naimed at hunting down this plague and confronting it,\r\nincluding by draining its resources as part of an overall\r\ndrive to uproot it altogether.\r\nIn parallel, Jordan’s stance is clear-cut and\r\ndecisive. We reject and condemn terrorism in all its\r\nforms and manifestations. We have declared in no\r\nuncertain terms this firm conviction against terrorism,\r\nirrespective of its source, the perpetrators or the\r\nidentity of the victims. Furthermore, we allow no room\r\nfor any justification whatsoever, including any possible\r\narguments on religious, ethnic or national grounds.\r\nThus, Jordan treats all forms of terrorism as criminal\r\nacts.\r\nIn the same context, let me stress our conviction\r\nthat the eradication of terrorism is a common goal of\r\nall States and societies. I wish therefore to draw the\r\nAssembly’s attention to the blatant tendency, driven by\r\npernicious and wicked intentions, to falsely link\r\nterrorism to a specific religion or culture. I trust that\r\nthis gathering shares my view that it is now imperative\r\nto confront these dubious attempts. Indeed, dealing\r\nwith such schemes is indispensable if we are to\r\nmaintain the sustained and concerted campaign to\r\nachieve the paramount objective: the total eradication\r\nof terrorism.\r\nThe current situation in the Middle East is\r\nextremely dangerous. The whole landscape is\r\nconstantly changing for the worse, especially in the\r\noccupied Palestinian territories. Israel’s reoccupation\r\nof the Palestinian Authority’s territories and the\r\nperpetuation of this occupation, together with the\r\nmeasures and policies emanating thereof, particularly\r\npolicies of closure and siege, have created intolerable\r\nliving conditions for the Palestinian people. These\r\nunbearable conditions have prompted several\r\nhumanitarian agencies and international organs to\r\ndeclare a state of emergency. Israeli measures to\r\nstrangle the Palestinian people economically and\r\npolitically, with a view to bringing the Palestinians to\r\ntheir knees and to coercing them into surrendering their\r\nrights, have reached inadmissible levels of seriousness.\r\nMalnutrition rates among the Palestinian population\r\nhave doubled. Diseases related to malnutrition and\r\nhunger have become widespread, particularly among\r\nchildren, women and the elderly. The joint impact of all\r\nthese factors has created breeding grounds for\r\nfrustration and despair, which inevitably generate\r\nhatred, grudges and violence.\r\nTherefore, this situation must be addressed\r\neffectively and expeditiously. We hope that the first\r\nmove will come from Israel in the form of ending its\r\noccupation of Palestinian towns without delay. We also\r\nexpect Israel to cease forthwith its policies of closures\r\nand siege. It is in Israel’s interest to pursue\r\nconstructive policies towards the Palestinians in order\r\nto restore mutual confidence and to rehabilitate the\r\nvalues of reconciliation and coexistence between the\r\ntwo peoples. It is our considered view that Israel’s\r\ncurrent approach is irrational, as it results in excessive\r\nuse of force, which in turn fuels and deepens hatred\r\nand replenishes the sources of violence.\r\n10\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nWhile we welcome the few visible signs of relief,\r\nas reflected in the accord reached by the Palestinian\r\nand Israeli sides on 19 August 2002, which calls for\r\nprogressive withdrawal by Israel from certain\r\nPalestinian towns that have been reoccupied by Israel,\r\nwe call on Israel to implement faithfully and\r\nexpeditiously Security Council resolution 1402 (2002),\r\nwhich provides for full Israeli withdrawal from all\r\nPalestinian cities.\r\nFrom a political and humanitarian point of view,\r\nJordan stands against targeting Israeli civilians and\r\nconcurs with the need to address the whole spectrum of\r\nsecurity issues. However, it maintains that the only\r\nviable course for addressing the Palestinian-Israeli\r\nquestion lies in the resumption of the peace process as\r\na whole, from the point where it stalled and within the\r\nagreed framework established on the basis of complete\r\nIsraeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied\r\nsince 1967, including the Palestinian, Syrian and\r\nLebanese territories; the establishment of an\r\nindependent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as\r\nits capital, pursuant to relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, particularly 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425\r\n(1978) and 1397 (2002).\r\nIn that context, I wish to stress the significance of\r\nthe initiative adopted by the Arab leaders at the Beirut\r\nArab Summit last March. That initiative outlined a\r\nbalanced approach in terms of practical ideas and\r\narguments that demonstrate beyond any doubt a\r\ngenuine pan-Arab commitment to just, lasting and\r\ncomprehensive peace. That plan is a pledge by Arab\r\nStates to conclude peace agreements with Israel in\r\nreturn for its complete withdrawal from the Palestinian,\r\nSyrian and Lebanese territories to the 4 June 1967\r\nborders, the establishment of an independent\r\nPalestinian State with East Jerusalem its capital and\r\nfinding a just and agreed solution to the Palestinian\r\nrefugees question on the basis of the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions.\r\nI trust that the Government of Israel will rise to\r\nthe level of the hopes and aspirations of the Arab\r\npeoples and the people of Israel to live in peace, justice\r\nand dignity. We hope that the Government of Israel will\r\nbe forthcoming in response to that balanced and sincere\r\ninitiative, which gained the acceptance of all States and\r\nparties interested in the peace process. Furthermore,\r\nthis initiative is also in line with the vision and the\r\ncommitment outlined by President George W. Bush of\r\nthe United States on the form and aim of a final\r\nsolution on the Palestinian-Israeli track based on the\r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian state\r\nexisting alongside the State of Israel by mid-2005 at\r\nthe latest.\r\nIn that regard, Jordan supports efforts being made\r\nto draw up a clear road map leading to the\r\nimplementation of President Bush’s commitment\r\nthrough, first, defining the obligations of both the\r\nPalestinian and Israeli sides; secondly, setting a clear\r\ntimetable for all phases of carrying out those\r\nobligations so that the deadline for the birth of the\r\nindependent Palestinian State will not, under any\r\ncircumstances, extend beyond mid-2005; and, thirdly,\r\nagreeing to the creation of an international supervisory\r\nmechanism that ensures the timely and orderly\r\nimplementation of those measures as well as\r\nmonitoring the implementation process.\r\nWe hope that this vision will be examined at the\r\nQuartet meeting in New York within the next few days,\r\nwith a view to adopting it into a plan of action and a\r\ncomprehensive international obligation. Subsequently,\r\nthe parties will embark on the implementation process\r\nwithin the specified framework, whose outcome will be\r\nthe establishment of an independent Palestinian State\r\nwithin less than three years. We also hope that this\r\nachievement will generate a fresh impetus to conclude\r\ncomprehensive peace on the Syrian-Israeli and\r\nLebanese-Israeli tracks within the same time frame.\r\nIn compliance with the United Nations principles\r\nenshrined in the Charter, particularly Article 2,\r\nparagraph 4, which prohibits the threat or use of force\r\nin international relations, and considering that this right\r\nis exclusively assigned to the Security Council so that\r\nthe Council may exercise it in case of a breach of\r\ninternational peace and security, Jordan believes that\r\nthe most appropriate means for resolving the matters\r\noutstanding between the United Nations and Iraq is to\r\nensure the immediate and full implementation of all\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, including those\r\nrelating to Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons as\r\nwell as to the return of the weapons inspectors. If these\r\nconditions are met, the people of Iraq, who have been\r\nsuffering for too long, would be saved from military\r\naction that would exacerbate that suffering. The\r\naforementioned formula would also spare the entire\r\nregion the dire consequences of military operations.\r\nIn the context of emphasizing the principle of\r\nresolving disputes by peaceful means, we invite the\r\n11\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to respond to the call made by\r\nthe United Arab Emirates to reach a peaceful\r\nsettlement of the problem of the three islands. We urge\r\nIran to accept referral of this case to the International\r\nCourt of Justice. We also encourage the efforts made\r\nby the two sides in Cyprus to reach a just and peaceful\r\nsolution to the Cypriot question. We also call for the\r\npeaceful resolution of the dispute between India and\r\nPakistan over Kashmir. We have no doubt that the\r\nAssembly will support and strengthen those efforts.\r\nJordan recognizes the nature of the\r\ntransformations that have taken place in international\r\nrelations and the global landscape over the past decade.\r\nThus, we stress the need for the United Nations to\r\nadapt accordingly, through effective streamlining, so\r\nthat it will maintain its relevance as the primary\r\ninternational forum of global cooperation and\r\ncoordination in all human fields. A robust United\r\nNations would also remain the true embodiment of the\r\nhopes and the aspirations of all mankind.\r\nHere, I wish to pay special tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the foresight, dynamism and\r\nflexibility he brings into play while performing his\r\nduties. Those fine personal qualities enhance his\r\nimpressive performance, which Jordan supports and\r\nappreciates.\r\nMr. Gallegos Chiriboga (Ecuador), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nIn closing, I would like to warmly welcome the\r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\r\nthe entry into force of its Statute. Our expectation is\r\nthat the Court will enhance the great principles and\r\npurposes of the United Nations itself. Let me underline\r\nour absolute support for all efforts aimed at\r\nstrengthening and revitalizing the United Nations\r\nsystem, including the ongoing structural reform\r\nexercise and the review of Security Council\r\nmembership with a view to its expansion in order to\r\nmake it more representative of the new international\r\nrealities. Finally, I wish the Assembly all success in its\r\ndeliberations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency The Honourable\r\nMr. Joseph Borg, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malta.\r\nMr. Borg (Malta): Allow me to begin by offering\r\nMr. Jan Kavan my Government’s warm congratulations\r\nas he assumes the presidency of the General Assembly.\r\nHe has served the Czech Republic so well as Foreign\r\nMinister, and I have full faith in his ability to meet the\r\nnumerous challenges that the fifty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly will no doubt present. I assure\r\nhim of my delegation’s full support in the execution of\r\nhis duties.\r\nAllow me also to take this opportunity to express\r\nmy appreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo for the skill and\r\ndedication with which he served this body during the\r\nsession that has just come to a close.\r\nIt gives the Government of Malta great pleasure\r\nto welcome the recent admission of the Swiss\r\nConfederation to our family of nations. We look\r\nforward to also welcoming among us the Democratic\r\nRepublic of East Timor. Their addition serves to further\r\nstrengthen the trust and belief of all our nations that\r\ndialogue within a multilateral context is both\r\nworthwhile and irreplaceable.\r\nOver the past couple of weeks the international\r\ncommunity has been seized of the issue of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Malta participated actively in the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held in South\r\nAfrica, and although the Summit’s very ambitious\r\nobjectives could not all be reached, we are satisfied\r\nthat a plan of action — the Plan of Implementation —\r\nwith specific targets to tackle key development\r\nproblems has been adopted. Throughout the\r\nnegotiations, Malta worked closely with the European\r\nUnion to include concrete plans and targets in the plan\r\nof action. As a result, the Summit agreed on a series of\r\ncommitments in priority areas such as water and\r\nsanitation, desertification, energy and biodiversity. It is\r\nour hope that the plan of action will attract the\r\nnecessary additional resources that will make its\r\nimplementation possible, thereby making sustainable\r\ndevelopment a reality for an ever-increasing proportion\r\nof humanity.\r\nWhen I had the honour to address the Assembly\r\nat the last general debate, in November 2001, I pledged\r\nmy Government’s full support for the Franco-German\r\ninitiative against the reproductive cloning of human\r\nbeings. As a sponsor of resolution 56/93, which\r\nestablished the relevant Ad Hoc Committee, we have\r\ncarefully followed the deliberations within the\r\nCommittee on the philosophical, medical, legal and\r\nethical considerations associated with this pressing\r\nissue. This was a necessary debate which brought to\r\nthe fore the consensus that exists on the need to\r\n12\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nrespond to the challenges posed by scientists who are\r\nunable or unwilling to recognize the deep moral\r\nimplications of their actions, as well as the dangers that\r\nthey may pose to mankind. The convergence of\r\npolitical will has now been manifested. The time is\r\ntherefore ripe for the Ad Hoc Committee to be given a\r\nclear mandate to negotiate a convention on this matter.\r\nMy Government will strive for the timely conclusion of\r\nnegotiations in this regard, preferably before the end of\r\n2003. However, whether or not the international\r\ncommunity concludes such a convention before\r\nattempts at reproductive human cloning actually\r\nmaterialize, it is imperative that, through international\r\naction and national legislation, Member States deny\r\nsafe haven to those scientists willing to defy the\r\ninternational community.\r\nBefore this year is out we shall be\r\ncommemorating the twentieth anniversary of the\r\nopening for signature of the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. When, as a newly\r\nindependent State, Malta called for the commencement\r\nof negotiations on such a convention, it was concerned\r\nwith the numerous unresolved issues of the rights and\r\nobligations of States with regard to seas and oceans,\r\nand with the seeds of countless conflicts that they\r\nmight sow. It is today impossible to speculate on the\r\nnumber of occasions on which the legal certainties that\r\nthe Convention brought about have helped to defuse,\r\ndissipate or prevent altogether the scourge of conflict\r\nand war. It is the curse of international law in our times\r\nto make the news headlines only when it fails, while\r\npassing unnoticed and unsung when it succeeds.\r\nWe would do well to remain conscious of the role\r\nthat international law, based on the multilateral\r\nprocess, plays in the prevention of conflict and the\r\navoidance of threats to international security. That is to\r\nsay, we would do well to remember the role it plays in\r\nupholding the central mandate of the United Nations\r\nitself. The role of the instruments of international law,\r\nand in particular those such as the Convention on the\r\nLaw of the Sea, should be recognized for the\r\ncontribution they provide in that regard.\r\nUnited Nations Headquarters has just played host\r\nto the historic first session of the Assembly of States\r\nParties to the Rome Statute of the International\r\nCriminal Court. The complex changes to national\r\nlegislation necessary to allow for Malta’s ratification of\r\nthe Rome Statute have now reached an advanced stage\r\nand are expected to be presented to Parliament in the\r\ncoming days, thus enabling Malta to formally deposit\r\nits instrument of ratification very soon.\r\nThe new International Criminal Court (ICC) has\r\nits roots in the atrocities carried out during the last\r\ncentury — not least those addressed at the Nuremberg\r\ntrials. The ICC is thus a product of the lessons learned\r\nover time and of the widespread political will that has\r\nled to the creation of a credible deterrent to the would-\r\nbe perpetrators of the most heinous crimes. The ICC\r\nthus provides an effective, competent and fair forum\r\nwhere those individuals may be tried. The\r\nestablishment of the Court also represents a major\r\nbreakthrough in international law and one which has\r\nbecome more — and not less — crucial now that\r\nterrorism has imposed itself high on our international\r\nagenda.\r\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 still\r\nloom large in our memories. The anniversary of that\r\ntragedy has again filled our television screens with\r\nhorrific scenes of suffering and death. It has served to\r\nremind us of the resolve which is necessary in the face\r\nof such horror. My Government has taken part in the\r\nfight against international terrorism with full\r\ndetermination, and will continue to do so. This is\r\nevidenced not only by our thorough implementation of\r\nthe international conventions on terrorism and the\r\nongoing process towards the implementation of\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) but also by\r\never-tighter controls and scrutiny at our ports. We\r\nundertake further to intensify our efforts in this field in\r\norder to assist in the permanent eradication of terrorism\r\nin whatever shape or form.\r\nThe continued turbulence in the Middle East also\r\ncontinues to be a source of great concern to my\r\nGovernment. The cycle of violence that continues to\r\nengulf the region provides a confirmation, if ever one\r\nwere needed, that there is no purely military solution to\r\nthe conflict. The extrajudicial killings of Palestinians,\r\nthe deliberate destruction of the property and\r\nlivelihoods of innocent civilians and the subjection of\r\nthe entire Palestinian population to collective\r\npunishment does not dim the wholly legitimate\r\naspirations of the Palestinian people to a State of their\r\nown.\r\nLikewise, the targeting of Israeli civilians in\r\nsuicide bombings and other forms of destruction of the\r\nlives and property of innocent civilians does untold\r\n13\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nharm to the cause the perpetrators of those crimes\r\nclaim to support.\r\nNo cause, no argument and no justification can\r\nlegitimize these abhorrent acts by either party to the\r\nconflict.\r\nMy Government looks on in anguish as a fence,\r\nreminiscent of the Berlin wall, that most shameful of\r\nsymbols of the twentieth century, slowly takes shape. It\r\nis a harrowing reminder of how little mankind has\r\nlearned from the past, particularly if we look back to\r\nthe outbreak of violence in the region since September\r\n2000.\r\nUnjustified preconditions to the start of political\r\nnegotiations further hinder any progress in the\r\ndiscussions on a two-State solution to the conflict.\r\nNegotiations, which must start without further delay,\r\nmust be built on the clear and plain language of\r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\r\n(1973) and the principle of land for peace. The recent\r\ninitiative by the States members of the European Union\r\nin presenting a road map for the Middle East which\r\noutlines a three-stage process leading to the creation of\r\na Palestinian State by 2005 provides a genuine basis\r\nfor taking negotiations forward. The international\r\ncommunity looks to the Quartet to advance in that\r\ndirection with urgency.\r\nAn issue which continues to persist in the\r\nMediterranean is the situation in Cyprus, which has\r\nremained a cause of concern for more than 25 years.\r\nWe earnestly hope that an early settlement of the\r\nCyprus question will be found and reiterate our full\r\nsupport for efforts to find a solution on the basis of the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. The imminent\r\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union should\r\nprovide the necessary impetus for the resolution of this\r\nlong-standing problem.\r\nMalta is encouraged by the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General to engage the Organization in the\r\nquest to achieve a resolution to the situation with\r\nregard to Iraq before it deteriorates any further. My\r\nGovernment calls upon the Iraqi Government to\r\ncomply with all its obligations under all the provisions\r\nof relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular\r\nthose concerning disarmament with respect to weapons\r\nof mass destruction. Iraq must meet its commitments\r\nand allow the re-entry of United Nations inspectors\r\ninto its territory without any preconditions and as\r\nstipulated by the Security Council.\r\nThe international community should spare no\r\neffort in exploring all political and diplomatic options\r\nthat would or could assist in resolving the issue. Malta\r\nis in agreement with the Secretary-General that if Iraq\r\nfails to meet its obligations, the Security Council, as\r\nthe organ entrusted with the primary responsibility for\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security,\r\nmust shoulder its responsibilities. The Security Council\r\nhas to ensure compliance with its own resolutions in\r\nthe interest of the international rule of law.\r\nMalta’s location at the centre of the\r\nMediterranean has provided us with opportunities for\r\ntrade and development, which we have been relatively\r\nsuccessful at exploiting in the interest of our island,\r\nwhich is otherwise bereft of natural resources. Our\r\nstrategic location is, however, now also the scene of\r\nanother socio-economic phenomenon of a much less\r\nencouraging nature. I speak here of the poverty divide\r\nthat cuts across the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nThe countries of the Mediterranean littoral share\r\nmuch in terms of history, culture and way of life.\r\nHowever the ever more apparent disparities of wealth\r\ncontinue to fuel the movement of thousands of people\r\nfrom the southern Mediterranean and further afield to\r\nentrust their lives and hopes into the hands of\r\nunscrupulous individuals. These traffickers of human\r\nbeings, willing to exploit misery and desperation, have\r\nlittle respect for human life and often abandon the\r\nwould-be immigrants to the elements once they have\r\nsecured their ill-gotten gains. My Government has\r\nincreased the punishment meted out to those found\r\nguilty of such heinous acts. We have also bolstered our\r\nsurveillance and rescue capability within our territorial\r\nwaters and are simultaneously seeking to provide\r\ntreatment that is as humane as possible to the victims\r\nthat land on our shores. These efforts have been made,\r\nhowever, in the full knowledge that they deal more\r\nwith the symptoms of the phenomenon of human\r\ntrafficking than with its root causes.\r\nThe imperative of narrowing the wealth divide\r\nacross the Mediterranean is one of the philosophical\r\ncornerstones of the Euro-Med process, which exists to\r\nbring the European Union and 12 Mediterranean States\r\ntogether on a number of issues of common concern.\r\nMalta has been an avid supporter of the process since\r\nits inception and looks forward to developing its role\r\nfurther within this forum as a member of the European\r\nUnion in the near future.\r\n14\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nMy Government believes that the accession of\r\nMalta to the European Union will serve to further\r\nenhance our capability to promote peace and prosperity\r\nwithin the Mediterranean, given our reputation as an\r\nhonest broker that can identify with both sides of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\nInasmuch as this is the case, we also believe that\r\nmembership in the Union will also serve to strengthen\r\nour own internal workings at all levels of society,\r\nbringing prosperity to the Maltese both now and for the\r\nyears to come. Indeed, we believe that membership in\r\nthe European Union constitutes a natural progression\r\nfor Malta, given our long-standing historical, cultural\r\nand political ties with the Union.\r\nThe negotiations concerning membership that are\r\ncurrently under way are nearing completion, and we\r\nlook forward to joining this union of like-minded\r\nStates at its next enlargement, in line with the timelines\r\nestablished at the Nice meeting of the European\r\nCouncil.\r\nMalta has always played a role on the\r\ninternational scene far in excess of its size. This we\r\nintend to continue, and I anticipate that all our efforts\r\nwill combine with those of the other nations of the\r\nworld to bring about improvements in all the areas that\r\nurgently call for our immediate attention. This\r\nunswerving determination will guide our efforts in the\r\nvarious forums of which we form part and in the\r\nactivities we undertake, as together we strive to make a\r\nbetter and secure world for this and future generations.\r\nI wish the President every success in his\r\nendeavours in presiding over the General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. László Kovács,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary.\r\nMr. Kovács (Hungary): Let me at the outset\r\nextend to His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, former\r\nForeign Minister of the Czech Republic, our sincere\r\ncongratulations upon his election as President of the\r\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. I want\r\nto assure him that he can safely count on the full\r\nsupport of my delegation in discharging his important\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nI would also like to welcome in our midst the\r\nlatest new State Member of the United Nations,\r\nSwitzerland.\r\nIt was only four days ago, when so many of us\r\nhere paid tribute at Ground Zero to the memories of the\r\nthousands of victims who lost their lives last year in\r\nthe brutal 11 September terrorist attacks. The\r\nremembrance there was heartbreaking, but at the same\r\ntime it was a day of resolve as well. There is no doubt\r\nin my mind: this was a time that again brought into\r\nfocus our deep commitment to freedom and democracy.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to reiterate that the people\r\nand the Government of Hungary continue to maintain\r\nrelentlessly their strong solidarity with the United\r\nStates.\r\nOur contemporary world has been decisively\r\ntransformed since 11 September 2001. The fight\r\nagainst international terrorism is high on our agenda.\r\nHungary is strongly committed to the effective efforts\r\nof the community of nations to counter this threat.\r\nTowards that goal, we have consistently acted in\r\ncooperation with our allies and the rest of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn that respect, Hungary supports the ongoing\r\nglobal endeavours of the United Nations aimed against\r\nterrorism. We find it crucial that Member States make\r\nevery necessary and possible move to prevent further\r\nterrorist acts and implement national measures under\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions to combat that\r\nphenomenon. Effective cooperation among States is\r\nalso indispensable to act resolutely against the menace\r\nof terrorism.\r\nBesides being a reliable partner in the global\r\ncoalition, Hungary has taken the necessary domestic\r\nlegislative and executive measures to implement the\r\ndecisions of the international community. The\r\nParliament of Hungary this week took the decision to\r\nratify the International Convention for the Suppression\r\nof the Financing of Terrorism. By this legislative act,\r\nHungary has become a party to all of the international\r\ninstruments adopted by the United Nations against\r\nterrorism. We continue to attach particular importance\r\nto the unimpeded work of the Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee of the Security Council, with which we\r\nmaintain a particularly close relationship.\r\nIn the context of the global coalition against\r\nterrorism, Hungary is following developments in\r\nAfghanistan with keen interest. We welcome the\r\nconsolidation achieved so far by the Government of\r\nAfghanistan with the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity. We wish to place on record our deep\r\n15\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nappreciation for the excellent work done by the\r\ninternational forces. in that country. Further efforts to\r\ncontain and eliminate terrorist groups in Afghanistan\r\nwill remain a top priority. Hungary is committed to\r\nmaintaining its support to the Government of\r\nAfghanistan as well as to its people.\r\nIraqi non-compliance with Security Council\r\nresolutions is a serious concern for all of us. Hungary\r\nregrets that the Iraqi regime refuses to cooperate with\r\nthe United Nations and continues to pose a threat to\r\npeace and security in the region and the world at large.\r\nThe international community cannot disregard this fact\r\nand has to respond to it in a resolute manner. We will\r\nwork closely with our allies and partners to pursue the\r\nfull implementation of the relevant Security Council\r\nresolutions, and we will do our share in the efforts to\r\nbuild a broad coalition of nations in order to prevent\r\nthe Iraqi regime from producing and using weapons of\r\nmass destruction.\r\nHaving entered the twenty-first century, mankind\r\ncontinues to face further major global challenges, such\r\nas illicit drug trafficking, money-laundering, corruption\r\nand transnational organized crime. The role of the\r\nUnited Nations in facing and tackling these phenomena\r\nis of paramount importance. By the same token, global\r\nrisks are widened by new types of security threats. In\r\nour view, serious problems of regional stability, of low-\r\nintensity armed conflicts and threats of natural and\r\nman-made catastrophes are increasingly on the rise.\r\nIllegal transfers of nuclear, biological and chemical\r\nmaterials pose grave threats. Illegal migration and\r\nillicit trafficking in human beings are also rightly\r\nviewed as new forms of security risks. Hungary is more\r\nthan prepared to play its role, with all the means at our\r\ndisposal, to meet these new challenges through\r\nconcerted international efforts, including regional\r\narrangements.\r\nThe year 2002 marked the beginning of a new\r\nreview cycle of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. We expect the annual sessions of the\r\nPreparatory Committee leading up to the 2005 Review\r\nConference to make a significant contribution to the\r\nfurther strengthening of all aspects of this legal\r\ninstrument by ensuring its full implementation and\r\npromoting its universality.\r\nThe early start of negotiations on a fissile\r\nmaterial cut-off treaty stands out as the next logical\r\nstep aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclear\r\nweapons. We cannot but regret that disagreements over\r\nthe comprehensive programme of work are preventing\r\nthe Conference on Disarmament from starting\r\nsubstantive work on this issue.\r\nOne of the most important new threats to\r\ninternational peace and stability in the changed security\r\nenvironment at the beginning of the twenty-first\r\ncentury is caused by the proliferation of ballistic\r\nmissiles capable of delivering weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Hungary is ready to join international\r\nefforts to counter this danger, including new political\r\nand diplomatic initiatives. The system of multilateral\r\nlegal norms relating to non-proliferation, disarmament\r\nand arms control fails to include regulations on\r\nresponsible international behaviour concerning ballistic\r\nmissiles. Out of the several propositions emerged\r\nrecently, Hungary lends its utmost support to the\r\nnegotiations on an international code of conduct\r\nagainst the proliferation of ballistic missiles. We\r\nappreciate the vigorous efforts of the States members\r\nof the European Union to move this process forward\r\nand hope for its successful completion in the near\r\nfuture.\r\nDevelopments over the past 12 months have\r\nraised more critically than ever the question of how to\r\naddress in an efficient way the challenges posed by the\r\ndeliberate spread of disease, such as the anthrax\r\nincidents. The reinforcement of national public health\r\nand civilian defence capabilities is crucial, even though\r\nthere are only a few countries that, acting alone, can\r\nput meaningful assets in place. International\r\ncooperation in this respect must not be a distant\r\nopportunity; it is in the interest of each and every\r\ncountry, and of all nations as a whole.\r\nComplementary preventive efforts would be\r\nneeded as well to at least diminish the likelihood of\r\nsuch an occurrence. Among such preventive efforts, the\r\nbenchmarking of arms control compliance will\r\neventually have to find its legitimate place. That is why\r\nwe deem important the successful conclusion of the\r\nFifth Review Conference of States Parties to the\r\nBiological Weapons Convention, to be resumed in\r\nNovember this year under Hungarian chairmanship.\r\nHungary remains strongly committed to the\r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its\r\nverification regime. In this regard, we concur with the\r\nview that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation\r\nwill also be essential to combat international terrorism.\r\n16\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nHungary has, from the very beginning, given its\r\nstrong support to the establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court (ICC). The ICC has become the first\r\nmajor multilateral legal institution of the twenty-first\r\ncentury. We were proud to become a State party to the\r\nStatute of the ICC and to be among those whose\r\nratification helped bring about the entry into force of\r\nthe Statute this year. We firmly concur with the view\r\nthat international law will be strengthened through this\r\nnew legal institution.\r\nAs a sign of our deep commitment to the Rome\r\nStatute, my Government has decided to nominate a\r\ncandidate to the panel of judges of the ICC. I am\r\nconfident that the election of a Hungarian judge would\r\ncontribute to the genuine realization of the objectives\r\nset out in the Rome Statute.\r\nHuman rights are universal values. States\r\nMembers of the United Nations are expected to observe\r\nthe norms and standards of human rights and\r\nfundamental freedoms, including minority rights,\r\nadopted by the United Nations. By the same token, it\r\nwill remain the moral and political responsibility of\r\nStates to call upon others to act in accordance with\r\ntheir voluntarily undertaken obligations. Hungary will\r\nnot hesitate to raise its voice when human rights are\r\nviolated in any part of the world. International\r\nprotection of minority rights remains a major\r\npreoccupation for us. We continue to pursue our efforts\r\naimed at a functioning universal legal system for the\r\nprotection of minorities.\r\nGlobalization and interdependence are two major\r\nphenomena shaping the contemporary world, including\r\nthe political landscape of the United Nations.\r\nBy taking advantage of the opportunities\r\nstemming from these phenomena, all of us could seek a\r\nmuch better life for the inhabitants of our globe. The\r\nUnited Nations has the necessary instruments at hand.\r\nA better and more responsible use of these instruments\r\ncan contribute to the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration Development Goals, aimed at creating a\r\nmore prosperous and sustainable world for generations\r\nto come.\r\nIf we have the necessary political will and\r\ndetermination, we can have a United Nations that\r\nworks relentlessly to improve the lives of all. That is,\r\nin the final analysis, what the United Nations was\r\nfounded for.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. George Papandreou,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Greece.\r\nMr. Papandreou (Greece): The challenges we\r\nface at the beginning of the twenty-first century are\r\nimmense. We are facing terrible poverty; crises and\r\nwars; millions of refugees; the hideous face of\r\nterrorism; trafficking in human beings, arms and drugs;\r\nand regions decimated by disease as we continue to\r\ndestroy the earth’s ecological balance.\r\nThere are no simple answers to these problems.\r\nBut there is a place where we all can meet to find\r\nsolutions: the United Nations. The world needs a strong\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI have just quoted my Swiss colleague, first of all\r\nto celebrate his country’s and East Timor’s entry into\r\nthe United Nations, and secondly because I fully agree\r\nwith his statement.\r\nIn the words of Kofi Annan:\r\n“The more a country makes use of\r\nmultilateral institutions — thereby respecting\r\nshared values, and accepting the obligations and\r\nrestraints inherent in those values — the more\r\nothers will trust and respect it, and the stronger\r\nits chance to exercise true leadership”. (See\r\nA/57/PV.2)\r\nI know the personal commitment of my dear\r\nfriend Jan Kavan, the President, to this principle. Our\r\ntwo countries have worked closely in a common effort\r\nto promote peace, the rule of law and shared values in\r\nSouth-eastern Europe.\r\nToday we can be proud that we also contributed\r\nin changing this region. It is no longer “CNN-able”, as\r\nour colleague from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr.\r\nLagumdjia, said yesterday.\r\nYet this has not been an easy process.\r\nTake my country, Greece. In the previous century,\r\nwe went through two world wars, two Balkan wars and\r\na major war with Turkey, which resulted in millions of\r\nrefugees and in painful population exchanges. We\r\nsuffered under civil war, famine and dictatorship. We\r\nwitnessed the forced division of Cyprus through\r\nmilitary invasion and occupation by Turkey, and the\r\nrecent wars in the disintegrating former Yugoslavia in\r\nour backyard. Not far from us, conflict continues. We\r\nstand ready to support all efforts to ensure that Israel\r\n17\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nmay be secure and that the Palestinians may have a\r\nState they can call their own.\r\nIt is no wonder that today we cherish the peace\r\nwe have achieved. It is no wonder that we cherish the\r\nfact that Greece today has its most stable democracy in\r\nmodern history, that we are among the more prosperous\r\ncountries in the world, and that we will soon be hosting\r\none of the most demanding events humankind has\r\ncreated, the Olympics. This to us is a responsibility.\r\nWe have learned our lessons. We are where we\r\nare today only because of our people’s steadfast\r\ncommitment to work for the shared values of\r\ndemocracy, peace, justice, and human rights.\r\nIt is no wonder that Greece has become a\r\nchampion of the enlargement of the European Union,\r\nbecause the European Union is a community of values,\r\nand being a community of values is the biggest peace\r\nproject of our region. We have a responsibility to our\r\nneighbours, from Turkey to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nto see them, sooner or later, part of this wider European\r\nfamily — creating a new vision where all can share the\r\nvalues of peace and democracy and be citizens of the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\nWe have learned that at the heart of these\r\nconflicts are human beings, as the Danish Prime\r\nMinister, Mr. Rasmussen, has said. We have learned\r\nthat democracy and human rights are fundamental to\r\nthe life and dignity of all human beings.\r\nWhenever our global principles are violated, it is\r\nusually in societies and places where extremism and\r\nlack of democracy exist. I believe that democracy will\r\nisolate the phenomena that we have seen in recent\r\nyears, such as that of 11 September.\r\nWe in Greece have also known terrorism. We\r\nhave suffered at the hands of a small terrorist\r\norganization called November 17. Since June, Greek\r\nsecurity forces have brought all the key members of\r\nNovember 17 to justice. This formidable achievement\r\nwas supported by assistance from allied intelligence\r\nagencies, to which we are indebted for their support.\r\nThis experience is just one more example of how close\r\ninternational cooperation can accomplish common\r\ngoals and protect our common values. It is also a\r\ntribute to our long-lasting democratic institutions.\r\nIn the European Union, we are building not only\r\na community of nations but a community of values.\r\nThe Greek presidency of the European Union, which\r\nbegins in January 2003, will promote the values of\r\ndemocracy and peace in every element of its agenda.\r\nWe want to focus our efforts on reinforcing the trans-\r\nAtlantic relationship. We believe that the United States\r\nand the European Union share the same democratic\r\nvalues. We must stand united in our efforts to promote\r\npeace within a multilateral framework.\r\nWe also will pay tribute to the cultural diversity\r\nthat is at the heart of the European project, with a focus\r\non reinvigorating democratic governance by renewing\r\nour efforts to build social inclusiveness and civil\r\nparticipation across borders, working with our new\r\nneighbours, from the Baltic region to the\r\nMediterranean, from the Atlantic to the Caucasus, a\r\nnew neighbourhood of peace, cooperation and\r\ndemocracy.\r\nIn this community of values, I should like to talk\r\nabout a case in point. A few years ago, the notion of\r\nrapprochement between Greece and Turkey was\r\nunthinkable. Now, with a common European vision,\r\nour Governments are creating a framework to solve\r\nexisting problems, and citizen’s diplomacy is building\r\na bridge of peace between our nations. Athens and\r\nAnkara have concluded a number of agreements in\r\nareas ranging from energy to tourism, from education\r\nto landmines, designed to ease tension and strengthen\r\nour common interests. While fundamental differences\r\nremain on certain issues, in a short space of time, we\r\nhave come a long way — and we surely can go further.\r\nI welcome my discussion and meeting with the new\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gürel, and his\r\nwillingness to continue on this path of rapprochement\r\nand peace.\r\nYet our shared values are being sorely tested on\r\nthe issue of Cyprus. There is now a compelling\r\ndeadline for a resolution to the continuing division of\r\nthe island. Negotiations for the accession of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus to the European Union will be\r\nfinalized in December. We hope that a free, united\r\nCyprus will join a free, united Europe. Unification will\r\nundoubtedly bring greater security and prosperity to\r\nboth the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on\r\nthe island. But if a political settlement is not reached,\r\nthe internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus will\r\njoin alone. Let us therefore work to break down the\r\nwalls that keep future European Union citizens apart.\r\nWith the exception of Turkey, the whole world\r\nshares a vision for Cyprus as a federal State with a\r\n18\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nsingle international personality and a single citizenship,\r\nno foreign troops on its soil, and equal rights and\r\nsecurity guarantees for both the Greek and Turkish\r\nCypriot communities. The vast majority of the Cypriot\r\npopulation agrees that the two communities can and\r\nshould live together, united by shared values, while\r\npreserving their individual cultural identities.\r\nWe must respect United Nations resolutions on\r\nCyprus. They must be honoured, as my Maltese\r\ncolleague just repeated.\r\nCyprus is also a critical factor for the stability\r\nand security of South-eastern Europe and the Middle\r\nEast. A solution to this problem, therefore, will widen\r\nthe area of stability and peace throughout the region.\r\nNot much farther away, the situation in Iraq is a\r\nchallenge for us all. It challenges our respect for\r\ninternational law and our respect for international\r\norganizations. Greece vows to act in the way it sees fit\r\nto safeguard these valued principles.\r\nIn dealing with Iraq, our actions must be guided\r\nby evidence of a threat to global security, and must be\r\nembedded in respect for the well-being of the Iraqi\r\npeople. We must exhaust all available diplomatic\r\nmeans to ensure that Iraq complies with existing\r\nUnited Nations resolutions, immediately accepts the\r\nunconditional return of United Nations weapons\r\ninspectors and destroys all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. This will free the people of Iraq from the\r\neconomic sanctions, which are depriving them of their\r\nbasic needs.\r\nWe welcome the statement by President Bush. By\r\ntaking the issue of Iraq back to the Security Council, he\r\nhas both challenged the Council and empowered it to\r\nmove forward more effectively and more credibly.\r\nDemocracy is a value that should not be taken for\r\ngranted. It must be reinforced to meet new challenges\r\nin a globalizing world. In this spirit, Greece launched,\r\nin Johannesburg, the first-ever online global poll on\r\nsustainable development and the environment.\r\nElectronic democracy offers tremendous potential for\r\nbridging the digital divide that separates many peoples\r\nand individuals, for strengthening civil participation\r\nand for enhancing global democratic legitimacy and\r\ntransparency. We suggest that the United Nations\r\nestablish a new global forum — an electronic\r\nDemos — where citizens could articulate their views,\r\nmobilize around the issues that concern them and shape\r\npolitical decision-making, both nationally and\r\ninternationally.\r\nGreece will make good on its commitment to\r\nsustainable development by taking concrete actions and\r\nidentifying specific targets.\r\nThis year, many countries celebrated the\r\nestablishment of an institution that was founded on the\r\npremise that good global governance must be built on\r\nsound global principles. The International Criminal\r\nCourt represents a commitment by our community of\r\nnations that no crime against humanity will go\r\nunpunished. Creating a watertight system of global\r\njustice which requires all countries to uphold common\r\nrules, principles and rights will be an important step\r\ntowards building a real community of global values.\r\nFinally, I would like to say that those values lie at\r\nthe heart of the Olympic Truce, which was endorsed by\r\nthe Millennium Summit and the Millennium\r\nDeclaration. It is global peace initiative which was just\r\nrecently endorsed by the former President of South\r\nAfrica, Nelson Mandela. When he signed the Olympic\r\nTruce in June, President Mandela said:\r\n“The Olympic Games represent one of the\r\nmost evocative moments of celebration of our\r\nunity as human beings in pursuit of noble ideas.\r\nAmong those ideas is the quest for global peace.”\r\nWe uphold the values of democracy, human\r\nrights, peace and sustainable development; they can\r\nenrich us all. They can inspire us and challenge us.\r\nThey are values that can inspire change in one person,\r\nin one community or in a large nation. They are values\r\nthat can change the life of not just one person, but the\r\nworld as a whole. These are the values upon which we\r\nmust build our future and the future of our children.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Kamal Kharrazi,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke\r\nin Farsi; English text furnished by the delegation): I\r\nwould like at the outset to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan\r\non his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and to assure him\r\nof the full support and cooperation of the delegation of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran as he embarks on his\r\ncrucial task. I would also like to express my\r\nappreciation to the President of Assembly at its fifty-\r\n19\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nsixth session for his skilful leadership. I would also\r\nlike to welcome Switzerland to the United Nations, and\r\nlook forward also to welcoming the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his strong and compassionate leadership\r\nand for the vision and wisdom that he expressed in his\r\nstatement before the Assembly.\r\nThe world today is characterized by great\r\ndiversity and emerging factors with a far-reaching\r\ninfluence. In the light of advances in information\r\ntechnology and of the new international information\r\norder, current issues and problems are interrelated, like\r\nthe parts of an organism, and truly global. More than\r\never before, we see that nations and States are seeking\r\nto expand their options and ascertain the nature and the\r\nextent of their contribution to, and participation in,\r\nglobal affairs on the basis of not only their national\r\nsecurity and interests but also their regional\r\nresponsibilities, as well as international requirements\r\nand norms. This trend towards the achievement of such\r\nfundamental objectives points to the expansion of a\r\nglobal, democratic and participatory process that will\r\nendure in the long term and is thus sustainable.\r\nEmbracing diversity, questioning and critically\r\nreviewing the past and seeking democratic\r\nparticipation and action all teach us that the\r\nfundamental universal human values of peace and\r\nsecurity, freedom and independence, and justice and\r\nfairness must become the very centre of global\r\nattention. Without continued, active cooperation to\r\ndraw our world closer to such fundamental values, we\r\nwill not successfully meet the current global\r\nchallenges. Without expanding the scope of peace and\r\nsecurity, neither freedom nor independence will be\r\nachievable; without justice and fairness, neither peace\r\nnor security will become accessible; and without\r\nfreedom and independence, both peace and security\r\nwill become impossible to attain. It is only through\r\nsuch an approach that we will be able to work together,\r\nthink together and cooperate in a multilateral\r\nframework so as to find answers to challenges we face\r\nin common and to deal with regional crises.\r\nThe world is facing grave challenges today,\r\nparticularly in the aftermath of the tragic terror attacks\r\nof 11 September 2001. Chief among these challenges\r\nare terrorism and other forms of violence. Combating\r\nthe sinister phenomenon of terrorism is an urgent and\r\nunavoidable imperative. A genuine and effective fight\r\nagainst terrorism must include, on the one hand, an\r\nattempt to identify the root causes of terrorism and, on\r\nthe other, a concerted effort by the international\r\ncommunity to address them. It goes without saying that\r\nthe perpetrators of acts of terrorism must be brought to\r\njustice and given their just deserts. Calling for the root\r\ncauses of terrorism to be addressed should in no way\r\nbe construed as an attempt to justify terrorism or\r\ndetract from the gravity of terrorist acts or from the\r\nseverity of the punishments that terrorists deserve. It is\r\nintended to pinpoint an effective and comprehensive\r\nmeans of eliminating terrorism.\r\nIn this context, it appears that exploring problems\r\nsuch as the worldwide increase in injustice and\r\ndiscrimination, the marginalization of a large number\r\nof people and occupation and the violation of the\r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of others,\r\nextremism, fanaticism, bigotry, poverty and\r\nunderdevelopment could prove helpful in identifying\r\nthe root causes of terrorism.\r\nIn our opinion, a wise and principled approach to\r\nfighting terrorism would entail full international\r\ncooperation, expressed at the highest political level in a\r\nworld summit that would seek, inter alia, to develop an\r\ninclusive definition of terrorism that is generally\r\nacceptable.\r\nIn a letter addressed to the Secretary-General\r\nimmediately after the disastrous attacks of 11\r\nSeptember, President Khatami called for such a world\r\nsummit to address this crucial issue and to encourage\r\ninternational cooperation to fight terrorism under the\r\nauspices of the United Nations.\r\nThere should be a worldwide campaign against\r\nall forms and manifestations of terrorism and their\r\nperpetrators, irrespective of the identity of the victims\r\nor the objectives. Distinction must also be made\r\nbetween acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of\r\npeoples under foreign occupation or aggression, in\r\naccordance with international law. Any campaign bent\r\non relating the inhuman phenomenon of terrorism to\r\ndivine religions that have always been the harbingers\r\nof peace, love, amity and moral decency is a great and\r\nunforgivable transgression against those religions and\r\ntheir countless followers.\r\nAs a victim of the most brutal acts of terrorism,\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran regards fighting terrorism\r\nin a genuine and comprehensive way as a top national\r\n20\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\npriority, and it is thus in the forefront of the\r\ninternational coalition against terrorism. To help\r\npromote regional and international peace and security,\r\nmy country has thus far signed bilateral agreements or\r\nis in the process of finalizing such agreements with\r\nmore than 20 countries on the extradition of offenders\r\nand on the provision of legal assistance for promoting\r\ncooperation in the areas of fighting terrorism, drug\r\ntrafficking and other organized crimes, of the\r\nextradition of criminals and of mutual legal assistance.\r\nWe are intent on further strengthening this policy of\r\nenhanced cooperation. In that context, and in\r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 1373\r\n(2001) and 1390 (2002), the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nhas reported to the Security Council Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee regarding its counter-terrorism efforts in\r\ngeneral and about the measures it has adopted against\r\nthe Taliban and Al Qaeda in particular.\r\nWe are greatly concerned by the current trend of\r\ninternational disarmament negotiations, which is\r\nleading to the further vulnerability and fragility of\r\ninternational security. Rejection of the Comprehensive\r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) by a permanent\r\nmember of the Security Council and the holder of the\r\nlargest nuclear arsenal, and the withdrawal of that\r\nmember from negotiations on the CTBT on-site\r\ninspection operational manual, point to that State’s\r\npolicy of unilateralism. Further signs of such a policy\r\nare its withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile\r\nTreaty, its blocking of the negotiations on a protocol\r\nstrengthening the implementation of the Biological\r\nWeapons Convention and its going against the\r\njudgement of the international community with respect\r\nto the regulation of the trade and transfer of small arms\r\nand light weapons.\r\nIt is only by developing a broader view of\r\nmultilateralism, international cooperation and respect\r\nfor the rule of law that we can guarantee progress and\r\nsuccess in the field of disarmament and international\r\nsecurity issues. Expansion of and deeper respect for\r\nhuman rights throughout the world are a function of\r\ntheir universality and indivisibility, on the one hand,\r\nand of the recognition of national and regional\r\nparticularities and cultural backgrounds, on the other.\r\nRejecting the use of human rights for\r\npolitical purposes, rejecting double standards and\r\ndiscriminatory approaches, and promoting international\r\ncooperation in that field for the sake of human rights\r\nwill definitely help promote respect for human rights\r\nand fundamental freedoms. Such an approach prevailed\r\nat the fifty-eighth session of the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights, and my country thus received a\r\nfavourable decision. We are pleased that, with the\r\ncooperation of other States, our draft resolutions on\r\ndeveloping international cooperation in the field of\r\nhuman rights and on promoting cultural diversity were\r\nadopted.\r\nGlobalization will yield fruitful results when\r\nit is accompanied by a non-selective and non-\r\ndiscriminatory approach: when it provides equal\r\nopportunities for all within the framework of a global\r\npartnership. If the developed countries fail to fulfil\r\ntheir responsibilities, globalization can hardly be called\r\na success story. An open, equitable, law-based,\r\ntransparent and non-discriminatory international\r\ntrading system is a prerequisite for achieving the goals\r\nof economic growth and sustainable development in\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe continued brutalities in occupied Palestine\r\nonce again indicate that solutions not well grounded in\r\njustice and realism will fail to bring about lasting peace\r\nin the Middle East region. The Palestinian people have\r\nthe right, under international law, the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, to persist in their struggle to restore\r\ntheir inalienable rights. Occupying other people’s land\r\nmust be condemned, as must labelling as terrorist a\r\nnation that is only fighting to liberate its homeland.\r\nThe way to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle\r\nEast is to guarantee to Palestinians the right to return to\r\ntheir homeland and the right to self-determination,\r\nleading to the formation — in a democratic process and\r\nunder the supervision of the United Nations — of a\r\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\r\nIt is the Palestinian people’s legitimate right to choose,\r\nthrough democratic means, their future political system\r\nand the manner in which they elect to establish their\r\ncivil and political order. We respect the choices that the\r\nPalestinian people make.\r\nThe long-standing policy of the Islamic Republic\r\nof Iran towards Afghanistan has been the rejection of\r\nviolence, the promotion of intra-Afghan dialogue and\r\nthe establishment of a representative Government by\r\ndemocratic means. We are pleased that, as a result of\r\ninternational efforts — particularly by the United\r\nNations — civil order is gradually being consolidated\r\nby the Afghan people themselves through the\r\n21\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nestablishment of the Interim Administration, the\r\nEmergency Loya Jirga and the Transitional\r\nGovernment. Formulating Afghanistan’s Constitution\r\non the basis of democratic principles, Afghan culture\r\nand tradition, taking into account the views of all\r\nethnic groups, will be a major step in consolidating law\r\nand order, in strengthening the political structure and in\r\nachieving peace, security and stability in Afghanistan.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing its\r\nclose cooperation with the Transitional Government of\r\nAfghanistan, especially in the context of spending the\r\n$50 million in assistance earmarked for small-scale\r\nreconstruction projects in Afghanistan during the\r\nIranian fiscal year 1381, which began on 21 March\r\n2002. Joint efforts that are moving forward include\r\nproviding custom facilities and preferential\r\narrangements in customs, transit, trade and scientific,\r\ncultural and educational cooperation; combating drug\r\ntrafficking and terrorism; and helping Afghan refugees\r\nto return to Afghanistan. The international community\r\nis expected to make good on its pledges to Afghanistan\r\nso as to begin to rebuild the economic infrastructure\r\nthere and to create conditions conducive to the\r\nvoluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland.\r\nGreater attention and resources must be invested —\r\nparticularly by the United Nations International\r\nDrug Control Programme — in crop substitution\r\nprogrammes in Afghanistan as an effective strategy to\r\nfight narcotics trafficking.\r\nRespect for the sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq and compliance by Iraq with relevant\r\nSecurity Council resolutions — particularly those\r\nconcerning the return of the weapons inspectors to\r\nIraq — followed by the lifting of international\r\nsanctions in the interest of the oppressed people of\r\nIraq, constitute the overall policy of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran towards Iraq. We oppose any\r\nunilateral measures or military intervention in Iraq, we\r\nunderline the central role of the United Nations in that\r\nregard, and we hold that it is up to the people of Iraq to\r\ndetermine their own future through democratic means.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is following the\r\nsituation between its two neighbours, Pakistan and\r\nIndia, with much concern. As a neighbour, we wish to\r\nstress the age-old wisdom of the subcontinent and to\r\nimpress upon the leadership in both countries the\r\nimportance of exercising self-restraint in both word\r\nand deed and of keeping open the lines of\r\ncommunication and dialogue with a view to resolving\r\nthe situation in accordance with the rules and principles\r\nof international law and in the interests of both nations.\r\nThe current global trend towards participation in\r\ncollective efforts to face major international challenges\r\nand resolve regional crises through democratic means\r\nhas raised a glimmer of hope for our world today. No\r\ndoubt, dialogue among civilizations has a special place\r\nin charting the way and promoting understanding and\r\ntolerance in these troubled times. Dialogue, as a\r\nmultifaceted and long-term process, teaches us to grow\r\nout of the politics of domination that have created so\r\nmuch agony and violence and gradually to opt for the\r\npolitics of interaction, tolerance and communication. In\r\nthis context, the United Nations, as a centre of\r\ndialogue, international decision-making and\r\nimplementation, will increasingly gain in importance as\r\nthe international community resolves to strengthen\r\ninternational peace, security and development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nAngola, His Excellency Mr. João Bernardo de Miranda.\r\nMr. Miranda (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): Allow me, on\r\nbehalf of my Government and in my own name, to\r\nsalute Mr. Kavan on his election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly. We are convinced that his\r\nknowledge and diplomatic experience will guide us to\r\nsuccess in our activities.\r\nAs the international situation remains caught in\r\nthe throes of instability, insecurity, economic\r\nbackwardness and the scourge of pandemics and\r\nhunger, we nevertheless note with pleasure the great\r\nprogress that has been made since our last session.\r\nAfter decades of conflict, peace was finally restored\r\nthroughout southern Africa and is now slowly\r\nbecoming a reality in other regions. The people of East\r\nTimor were finally able to assert their self-\r\ndetermination and independence. Countries such as\r\nAngola, which have actively advocated the legitimate\r\nrights and interests of East Timor at the United\r\nNations, take great pleasure in welcoming that new\r\nsister republic to the family of this world Organization.\r\nImportant advances were also made by the\r\ninternational community in the struggle against\r\nterrorism. Thanks to a global and coordinated effort,\r\nmajor terrorist networks have been dismembered.\r\nAngola reiterates its strong condemnation of terrorist\r\nacts, such as that perpetrated against the American\r\n22\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\npeople in September last year. Angola continues to be\r\ncommitted to the strict implementation of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). We support stronger\r\ncontrol measures, particularly in the financial area, so\r\nas increasingly to curb the scope of action of terrorist\r\ngroups.\r\nAll these advances underscore the fact that, in\r\nspite of their complexity, the serious problems that\r\nafflict our world today can be resolved. No country or\r\nregion should be doomed to live forever under the\r\nscourge of war and terror or be deprived of its rights.\r\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations, the\r\ninternational community must react to crisis situations\r\nexpeditiously and effectively. Experience has shown\r\nthat belated and ineffectual reactions lead to the\r\nescalation of protracted and intractable conflicts,\r\nespecially in Africa. Fortunately, however, the\r\nindividual and collective efforts of many Governments\r\nin Africa are now easing these tensions, laying the\r\nessential bases for a solid, just and lasting peace.\r\nThe current situation in Angola is a reflection of\r\nthat reality. For the first time since our independence,\r\nAngola and Angolans are now enjoying a climate of\r\nauthentic peace, thanks to the allaying of factors that\r\ncould have provoked a resurgence of the past war and\r\ninsecurity. The efforts of the Angolan Government\r\nhave blazed the trail from a fratricidal war towards\r\nirreversible peace, thanks to the goodwill and profound\r\npatriotic spirit demonstrated by all Angolans. Military\r\nhostilities effectively ended seven months ago. The\r\npeace understandings reached on 4 April have been\r\nscrupulously adhered to. Armed political parties no\r\nlonger exist. Today, there is just one single army, under\r\nthe authority of the Angolan Government.\r\nThe peace process will soon be concluded with\r\nthe completion of the political tasks still pending under\r\nthe Lusaka Protocol. In Angola, the process of\r\neconomic and social rehabilitation is well under way\r\nand Government institutions have begun to operate\r\nnormally throughout our national territory.\r\nClearly, given the current situation, it will be\r\ndifficult for the Angolan Government to rise\r\nappropriately to the nation’s economic and social\r\nchallenges. Our main challenge now lies in the\r\nreintegration into society of thousands of combat\r\nveterans, 4 million displaced persons, refugees and\r\nthousands upon thousands of handicapped, war orphans\r\nand widows.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to\r\navail myself of this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, members of the troika of observer nations in\r\nthe peace process and all those who, in various ways,\r\nhave contributed to the achievement of peace in Angola\r\nand who have pledged their assistance to solve the\r\nproblems caused by the recently ended war.\r\nNow at peace, Angola is more than ever ready\r\nand willing to take up its role as a sister nation of\r\nAfrica and of the world. In the coming days, it will\r\nassume the presidency of the Southern Africa\r\nDevelopment Community, the most important regional\r\norganization for the economic integration of southern\r\nAfrica. Angola is also a candidate for a non-permanent\r\nseat in the Security Council in the elections scheduled\r\nfor this session of the General Assembly. In these\r\nbodies, Angola intends to contribute actively towards\r\nan environment of stability, fostering the development\r\nand economic welfare of our peoples. Of central\r\nconcern to Angola is the issue of peace in Central\r\nAfrica, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo. Only over time will it be possible to avert the\r\nwidespread destabilization of the region.\r\nAngola has been a factor of stability in Central\r\nAfrica, having contributed substantially to the\r\ncessation of the wave of violence and to the relative\r\npeace now enjoyed by the population in the area.\r\nIn the context of these efforts, and under\r\nAngola’s aegis, the Presidents of the DRC and Uganda\r\nsigned an agreement in Luanda on 6 September. This\r\nwas seen as a crucial step for the complete settlement\r\nof the Congolese conflict and for the establishment of\r\ngood neighbourly relations between the two countries.\r\nAngola welcomes the diplomatic initiatives\r\nundertaken by other countries to resolve the conflict,\r\nwhether or not they are involved in the conflict, under\r\nthe Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and the\r\nunderstandings reached by the Congolese parties\r\nthemselves. Angola advocates a new regional order of\r\npeace, security, cooperation and development, to be\r\nbased on respect for sovereignty and territorial\r\nintegrity, non-intervention in the internal affairs of\r\nother States, democratic values and respect for human\r\nrights. We are willing to work together with other\r\ncentral and southern African countries and to offer\r\nthem our good offices.\r\nThe instability in some parts of the world requires\r\na greater measure of commitment by the United\r\n23\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nNations and the parties concerned for peace and\r\nsecurity. Special attention should continue to be\r\nfocused on the settlement of the Somali conflict,\r\nfostering unification of the country and consolidation\r\nof lasting peace there. In Western Sahara, we are\r\nconcerned at delays in the process towards a\r\nreferendum by those resident in the territory. Angola\r\nurges the parties involved to show flexibility and to\r\ncontinue cooperating with the United Nations and the\r\nAfrican Union towards a negotiated settlement.\r\nIn the Middle East, renewed escalation of the\r\nviolence may hamper current initiatives towards a\r\npeaceful settlement of the Palestine issue and the\r\ntermination of Arab-Israeli crisis. We urge the parties\r\nto return to the negotiating table and to find a political\r\nsettlement that will serve the best interests of all\r\npeoples living in the region and meet their security\r\nrequirements.\r\nLast July, the African States established the\r\nAfrican Union as a more effective tool to help in the\r\nresolution of innumerable problems that are at the root\r\nof underdevelopment, such as poverty, foreign debt,\r\nlack of know-how and epidemics, among others. Our\r\npriority is to end the current economic stagnation in\r\nAfrica. The establishment of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development reflects the determination of\r\nAfrican Governments to resolve the problems of\r\neconomic backwardness, poverty and social exclusion\r\nthat afflict the majority of their peoples and the\r\ncontinuing marginalization of Africa from international\r\nmarkets in terms of capital, services and goods. Angola\r\nhopes that the international community, especially\r\ndonor nations, will lend Africa a helping hand by\r\nincreasing official development assistance on the basis\r\nof fair and non-discriminatory criteria.\r\nIn closing, allow me to offer my hearty\r\ncongratulations to Switzerland as it joins our family of\r\nmembers of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Juli Minoves-Triquell, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Andorra.\r\nMr. Minoves-Triquell (Andorra) (spoke in\r\nCatalan): First of all, may I congratulate President Jan\r\nKavan, well known for his expertise in human rights,\r\non his election to preside over this General Assembly.\r\nMy congratulations also go to the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Han Seung-soo, for his hard work, and I commend\r\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\r\nwhose stewardship of the Organization in these trying\r\ntimes is particularly admirable. I also congratulate\r\nSwitzerland on its admission to membership in the\r\nOrganization.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly, more than\r\nin recent years, seems caught between the past and the\r\nfuture — a tragic past, an uncertain future. In New\r\nYork, and in the world, the catastrophe of the attacks of\r\n11 September seems so present with us that we feel its\r\nimprint still upon us, as if our souls were marked by\r\nthe fall of the towers and the cruel loss of life. We feel\r\nthis past as a tangible, palpable weight, and we also\r\nsense the future pressing in upon us.\r\nThis past year, we have witnessed the war in\r\nAfghanistan, the fall of the Taliban and the\r\nestablishment of a new Government in Kabul. Will\r\nthere be intervention in Iraq, will there be more attacks\r\nin America, in Europe, or elsewhere? What will the\r\nfuture bring?\r\nI ask these questions as Foreign Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra. Andorra is a small and\r\npeaceful country nestled in the protected valleys of the\r\nPyrenees. We have lived in peace for nearly a thousand\r\nyears. And yet we are not safe from the storms that\r\nbuffet the world. Because of our small size, our\r\nreliance on trade and our relations with our neighbours\r\nand the world — our diplomacy, if you will — are of\r\nthe greatest importance to our well-being. As we turn\r\nto the world, so, too, the world turns to us in the tens of\r\nmillions of tourists that visit us every year.\r\nOur industries, our citizens and our lives are as\r\nintimately linked to the world as to the mountains that\r\nsurround us. This link was clear in the profound\r\nsadness of our people over the loss of life in New York,\r\nWashington and Pennsylvania. We felt it as a visceral\r\nblow, a spontaneous expression of true sympathy.\r\nThe world surrounds us, although we often feel\r\nwe can do little to influence the course of events. And\r\nyet what we do know is how actively to seek peace,\r\nand thereby ensure our future. It is about the future, the\r\nidea of the future, that I wish to speak today.\r\nThe future. In order to understand it, we must\r\nlook not only to those events that are determining it,\r\nthat are forming it even as we speak, but also to its own\r\nhistory as an idea. What is the history of the future?\r\n24\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nHere I will only invoke, in passing, two earlier\r\nmodels that 500 years ago embodied our understanding\r\nof the future: God’s providence and the wheel of\r\nFortune. In the providential model of the future, God\r\nlooks down on the full history of the world from “the\r\nhigh citadel of eternity” in the words of Thomas\r\nAquinas. He sees everything, every grain of sand,\r\nevery sparrow that falls. “There is a special providence\r\nin the fall of a sparrow” Hamlet tells Laertes in\r\nShakespeare’s great play. But alongside this Christian\r\nunderstanding of God’s providence is another figure,\r\nthe pagan figure of Fortuna, who holds her wheel on\r\nwhich all men, king and commoner, rise and fall.\r\nHamlet is also aware of her power; he is buffeted by\r\nthe slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune, and he\r\nlongs to end his life, but he fears God’s prohibition\r\nagainst suicide. This very prohibition, shared by all\r\nthree of the great religions of the West, was broken by\r\nthe suicide attacks of 11 September. So, too, the\r\nprohibition that “thou shall not kill”. Life is precious: it\r\nis given to us, and we cannot take it away.\r\nIn these two models of the future, humanity is\r\npassive. We are puppets — God or Fortune pulls our\r\nstrings. But gradually we drew away from this passive\r\nenslavement to our fate, our destiny, and we struggled\r\nto master the future. The change in the future is first\r\nheard in the writings of that first theorist of diplomacy,\r\nthe cunning Machiavelli. In The Prince, he wrote that a\r\nruler must learn to profit from chance, or rather turn\r\nchance to his favour. In a typically violent metaphor, he\r\ntells the Prince that Fortune must be beaten.\r\nMachiavelli counsels him to wrestle with fortune and\r\nthereby create the future.\r\nAlthough Machiavelli was advising an absolute\r\nmonarch, and indeed his thought presaged a long\r\nperiod of monarchical absolutism, he understood that\r\nthe rulers and the administrators could no longer afford\r\nto be passive objects of history. They had to consider,\r\nto think, to attack fortune; to hurl the slings and shoot\r\nthe arrows back at her, if you will. In this shift, from\r\npassive object to active agent, the idea of the future\r\nbegins its transformation. In this future, Machievelli’s\r\nheirs — diplomats gathered here today — advise the\r\nmodern princes, the democratically elected rulers of the\r\nworld, for the general good of the people.\r\nThe future becomes an idea that we build through\r\nstrategy, thought and action, through laws and treaties\r\nwe enter into and must obey. That is the very purpose\r\nof the United Nations, the great parliament of the\r\nworld’s Governments, or in a less poetic but more apt\r\nimage, a great, international factory, in that it builds the\r\nfuture: a future, not for the wealthy or the powerful,\r\nnot for some nations, but for the world and its peoples.\r\nOut of the ruins of the Second World War, the\r\nnations of the world joined to create a better future for\r\nall humanity. The belief that binds us together is the\r\nbelief that together, only together, we can build a better\r\nworld for all: a glorious city on the hill; a new\r\nJerusalem; a Jerusalem of all religions, all beliefs; a\r\ncity of tolerance; a city very much like New York.\r\nThat is why, I think, the terrorist attacks were so\r\npainful, for New York City is very much an expression\r\nof the United Nations, a place for all of the citizens of\r\nthe world, all religions and all beliefs — the city of\r\ntolerance; a city that resolutely looks forward to the\r\nfuture; New York: city of dreams, city of the future.\r\nStrangely, even as New York was profoundly\r\nwounded by these attacks, no other city, I think, has\r\nbeen so resolute in looking forward. The city was not,\r\nnor is it, spoiled by revenge. New York always looks to\r\nthe future. While others may reproach the city for its\r\nindifference to its past, its forward-looking optimism is\r\nperhaps its greatest gift to the world.\r\nSo when we all saw in Andorra and elsewhere the\r\nattacks on the World Trade Center, my first response\r\nwas that the suicide hijackers did not know New York.\r\nThey did not know that this city has brought people\r\nfrom all countries together. They did not know the\r\npeople who would die in the collapse of the towers:\r\npeople from many of the religions and countries of the\r\nworld.\r\nBut then I realized that perhaps they did know,\r\nthat perhaps New York was their target, and that their\r\ntarget was the future. Or rather, their target was a\r\nfuture of tolerance: religious, cultural, personal.\r\nIndeed, it seems that the terrorists longed for purity, for\r\na pure vision of the future in which the tolerance — the\r\nimpurities — of New York would have no place.\r\nThey believed, but not in the uncertain future of\r\nNew York, the restless striving for the new. They\r\nbelieved that with their deaths they would enter\r\nparadise of the afterlife. They believed, sacrilegiously,\r\nthat they were the means of God’s providence.\r\nWhen the terrorists attacked America, they also\r\nattacked the future. They attacked the future of\r\ntolerance, a future controlled not by fate, but by\r\n25\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nmankind. We cannot let our notion of the future fall\r\nwith the towers, for the future is as fragile as the\r\ntowers proved to be, perhaps more so. The future is\r\nbuilt not of steel and stone, but of law and human\r\nsympathy.\r\nIn a way, I think, at least for the moment and\r\nperhaps necessarily, the terrorist attack on the future\r\nhas damaged it. It demanded a strong response: the\r\nmission in Afghanistan, the continued destruction of Al\r\nQaeda. That is the kind of response that the\r\nperpetrators of that violence would understand; a\r\nresponse that cannot be seen as a sign of weakness or\r\nvulnerability. It is a logical, and therefore necessary,\r\nresponse that the terrorists themselves unleashed.\r\nBut violence breeds violence, and the future of\r\nviolence is simple destruction: nothing — and nothing\r\nwill come of nothing. We run the risk of entering an\r\nendless war against a shadowy enemy; a war that,\r\ngiven the nature of the enemy, might prove very hard to\r\nwin completely. And yet it must be won.\r\nOur first and strongest line of defence against\r\nviolence is the rule of law, with diplomacy to enact it.\r\nThe United States, founded on the rule of law and on\r\nrights for all, understands that. Andorra understands\r\nthat, because without law we would not have survived\r\nas a country for nearly a millennium.\r\nThat is why Andorra believes in and supports\r\ninternational law and trusts the United Nations,\r\nparticularly its democratic members, to lead the world\r\nfrom its history of violence towards its common future.\r\nIn relation to Iraq, Andorra supports the role of the\r\nUnited Nations, and we shall follow carefully the\r\ndebates in the Security Council.\r\nTerrorism is not a conventional war: there can be\r\nno treaties, no compacts, with terrorists. Law is vital\r\nfor all countries, but terrorists do not care about laws.\r\nThey are without a country and pose a particular\r\ndanger and challenge. In that sense, we must embark\r\non an aggressive reaching out to all people, an\r\naggressive assertion of our common humanity. That\r\nmight well be a media campaign, although it needs to\r\ncome directly from all elected politicians and ministers.\r\nWe are not trying to abstract issues or win a war of\r\nwords. We need to pull everybody into the human\r\ncompact. We need to recognize our individual\r\nvulnerability.\r\nIt was America’s belief in its invulnerability that\r\nwas so profoundly shaken by the terrorist attack. Yet if\r\nthe sudden collapse of the towers and the fear and\r\nchaos of that day revealed a weakness, it also revealed\r\nstrength: the strength of its citizens’ resolve and the\r\nprofound sympathy of all the peoples of the world.\r\nIn the wake of 11 September we recognize both\r\nthe need for the rule of law and the cause of that need:\r\nthe vulnerability of all people to malevolent attack. The\r\nmotto of Andorra is Virtus Unita Fortior, which can be\r\nloosely translated as “United We Stand”. That is not\r\nsimply an appeal to patriotism or for a common front\r\nagainst the enemy. It is a recognition that together\r\npeople are stronger, because alone we are weak and\r\nvulnerable.\r\nNothing can justify the attack of 11 September\r\n2001. It is nevertheless important, here in the General\r\nAssembly, to consider the roots of violence. The\r\nterrorists turned their anger and alienation — political,\r\ncultural, economic and personal — into an abstract act\r\nof inhuman cruelty whose “solution” was the attack on\r\nthe towers. Only in the cold world of abstraction does\r\nthat attack symbolize anything beyond untold\r\nsuffering. We need to pull violence back from\r\nabstraction into the world of human conversation.\r\nIf people feel excluded from the future, their\r\nalienation gives them a mad and violent certainty. We\r\nmust get to work to rebuild an inclusive and tolerant\r\nidea of the future, an idea that is all too easily forgotten\r\nin war, an idea of the future in which everybody is\r\nprotected from those who would destroy it, an idea of\r\nthe future so strong that it includes those people who\r\nmight otherwise be tempted by the madness of playing\r\nGod.\r\nThat future is premised on awareness, not of the\r\nstrength of the nuclear nations or of powerful\r\neconomies, but of the vulnerability of this compact and\r\nof individual nations large and small. We must\r\nrecognize the power of our vulnerability, for in this\r\nrecognition, we recover our strength, our vision of a\r\ncommon future and the will to act together. It is\r\ntogether that we will win the war against terrorism.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency the\r\nHonourable Timothy Harris, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and Education of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): Allow me\r\nfirst to salute fellow leaders, whose tireless work and\r\n26\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\ntimeless commitment within and beyond the halls of\r\nthe United Nations help shape a more secure world for\r\nour peoples. Improving the human condition is a\r\ncharge to which we must remain resolutely committed.\r\nThis we can achieve only through meaningful\r\npartnership.\r\nLast year’s efforts and the promise of\r\ncommunity-building should not be excluded from this\r\nyear’s agenda. To build community partnership is\r\ncrucial; but, more importantly, we need equity. To fulfil\r\nexpectations of a better world, and to extract the lauded\r\nbenefits of globalization, much harder work is required\r\nto reduce the gap between rich and poor nations and\r\nthe haves and have-nots in our societies.\r\nHow can we explain the excruciating truths of a\r\nglobal marketplace where countries which are\r\ntechnologically deficient and heavily dependent on\r\nagriculture for their survival are encouraged, and even\r\ncoerced, into opening their economies and embracing\r\nfree trade, while larger and richer economies\r\nsystematically subsidize their domestic agricultural\r\noutput, mostly for political reasons, at a rate of\r\nbetween 22 to 60 percent annually.\r\nMr. President, your mandate this year — a very\r\ncritical one — will be to ensure that the peoples of the\r\nworld who suffer as a result of this inequity can truly\r\nrenew their faith in us and believe again in the values\r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMy delegation has said repeatedly that\r\nglobalization is not a bad thing. However, it continues\r\nto be managed badly. We insist that the current\r\nstructure of the global economy is inherently flawed. It\r\nserves to reward the powerful and to punish the weak.\r\nWhile we appreciate that our world is undergoing\r\nprofound and necessary changes, we cannot\r\ncountenance abandoning the principles and values that\r\nbind us within the human family and the family of\r\nnations.\r\nGlobalization, in our view, must include true\r\nuniversal equity in its application of shared\r\nresponsibility and good governance. The selective\r\nprocesses by which the agendas of the powerful few\r\nare advanced to the exclusion of the small, poor and\r\neconomically vulnerable States must be addressed with\r\na willingness to correct it. My delegation believes that\r\nthe United Nations is uniquely positioned to respond to\r\nthis challenge. Hence, my Government questions\r\nattempts to transform certain United Nations organs\r\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme\r\n(UNDP) into advisory bodies, and away from\r\ndevelopment assistance, which poor developing\r\ncountries need now more than ever.\r\nThe United Nations must evolve as a dynamic,\r\nreceptive and representative body to stem the tides that\r\nthreaten us. It must build or strengthen social safety\r\nnets in many developing nations, not oversee processes\r\ngeared at dismantling them. We must recommit to\r\nimproving lives and to re-energizing our fight against\r\npoverty, hunger and ignorance. The United Nations has\r\na significant role to play in this endeavour. Improved\r\ncoordination of United Nations agencies is critical in\r\nachieving these objectives.\r\nMy delegation urges Member States to pledge\r\ntheir support, and hopes that they will, to ensure that\r\nthe three conferences sponsored by the United Nations\r\nthis year — the International Conference on Financing\r\nfor Development, the special session on children and\r\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development — bear\r\nfruit. We remain hopeful that continued dialogue,\r\npartnership and the instrumentality of the United\r\nNations will enable us to make meaningful progress.\r\nA year has passed since the barbaric acts of\r\n11 September. The foundations of our world views\r\nhave changed dramatically, as has the way we look at\r\nourselves and at our commitment to personal, national\r\nand international security. Again, Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nunreservedly denounces any act of terrorism, anywhere\r\nin the world. We do not believe that the indiscriminate\r\nkilling of innocent people as an expression of despair\r\nor oppression is an acceptable means of redress. We\r\nvalue highly the sanctity of life, and my Government is\r\ncommitted to its protection. We will work together in\r\nthe United Nations to find international solutions to\r\naddress this outrage. Let us ensure that the continuing\r\nwar against terrorism is waged within the structures of\r\ninternational institutions such as the United Nations.\r\nYear after year, we call on the international\r\ncommunity to join our noble campaign to halt the\r\ntrans-shipment of nuclear wastes through our\r\nCaribbean region, but this call goes unheeded. I\r\nreiterate our appeal today. Saint Kitts and Nevis urges\r\nsustained follow-up action to give meaning and life to\r\nthe United Nations resolution adopted in 2000\r\ndeclaring the Caribbean Sea a special area in the\r\ncontext of sustainable development.\r\n27\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nRepresentation is crucial to the peoples of the\r\nworld, and, as my delegation has done in the past, I\r\nwish to re-emphasize the status of the people of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Membership in this\r\nOrganization is in itself a validation and celebration of\r\na people’s fundamental human rights. We therefore\r\nlament the continued stalemate that results in the\r\nexclusion of the people of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan from the United Nations family.\r\nThe contribution of the 23 million people of the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the global market, to\r\nthe international community in the areas of technology,\r\ntechnical assistance and development assistance is\r\nunmistakably significant. Its participation in\r\ninternational activities can rival, and in many instances\r\nsurpasses, that of many developed countries who are\r\nfull Members of the United Nations. It is unfortunate\r\nand most regrettable, therefore, that the United Nations\r\nhas been unable to create a meaningful and practical\r\nformula that would allow the Chinese people on both\r\nsides of the Taiwan Straits to resolve this impasse,\r\nwhich stymies the genuine hopes and desires of\r\nmillions of people who adhere to the principles of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and whose nation is a model\r\ninternational citizen.\r\nWe have witnessed how involvement by the\r\ninternational community can facilitate positive\r\ndevelopments, such as the emergence of nationhood.\r\nOn behalf of my Government and in my own name, I\r\nwelcome East Timor to the United Nations family. I\r\nsalute it and its great leaders and pledge my\r\nGovernment’s support in working with it in the years\r\nahead on issues of mutual interest and, of course, of\r\ninterest to the international fraternity of nations. I also\r\nextend a hand of welcome and friendship to the\r\nGovernment and the people of Switzerland. It has\r\nobserved the United Nations for many years, so it is no\r\nstranger to its proceedings. The Organization will\r\nbenefit greatly from its participation, and Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis looks forward to collaborating with it in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe incidence of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean\r\nregion is a real and growing threat to our security at a\r\nnumber of levels. In human terms, it threatens to\r\ndevastate families and to create a generation of\r\norphans. At the economic level, it places a tremendous\r\nburden on the health resources of our countries and has\r\nalready begun to undermine the economic\r\ninfrastructure of our countries. The most productive\r\nand able-bodied are at risk, and those infected with the\r\ndisease are less and less able to contribute to the\r\neconomic activity and growth of their countries.\r\nInstead, they require medical and financial support.\r\nResources earmarked for other areas have to be\r\nredeployed to address the new pandemic.\r\nIt is clear that pharmaceutical companies and\r\nGovernments that support them can do much more to\r\nreduce the cost of antiretroviral drugs. Private-sector\r\ncompanies must also do more to assist employees and\r\nfamilies suffering from HIV/AIDS. It is regrettable that\r\nthe $10 billion in resources required by the Global\r\nFund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are\r\nyet to be realized.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis repeats its call for new\r\nparadigms to redress the inequities of globalization. We\r\nurge the international community to develop\r\nappropriate frameworks to promote fundamental\r\nfreedoms as a comprehensive whole, not only in terms\r\nof political rights, such as the right to self-expression\r\nand the right to vote, but also the human right to\r\neconomic development. Only when we respond to the\r\ngenuine needs of humankind — only when the hungry\r\nare fed, the vulnerable made strong, the weak,\r\ndispossessed, disenfranchised and oppressed\r\nempowered and made to feel a sense of belonging, and\r\nwhen they are free to participate fully in issues relating\r\nto their future — can we have a world where anarchy,\r\nterrorism, inter-State conflicts and war recede.\r\nWhat we ask for is certainly attainable. We\r\nsimply call on the United Nations to facilitate systems\r\nwhere partnership, collective responsibility and respect\r\nfor each other are allowed to flourish. This is possible\r\nonce States realize that national policies in a global\r\neconomy have international consequences. Politics may\r\nstill be local, but when we take action locally we must\r\nremember that we are also global citizens. Thus, a\r\nprincipal goal of globalization should be to level the\r\nplaying field to provide equal opportunity. Strategies,\r\nas a consequence, should reflect confidence-building\r\nmeasures for free trade and sustainable development.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that the United Nations\r\nhas stood firm for peace, prosperity and security for all\r\npeoples. It has done much to ensure peace and justice\r\nthroughout the world, consistent with the principles of\r\ninternational law. It has set itself lofty goals for this\r\nmillennium: basic education for all, eradicating\r\npoverty, reducing HIV/AIDS, and ensuring sustainable\r\n28\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\ndevelopment for all. Our people and, indeed, all\r\ncitizens of the global community pray that the political\r\nwill will be found to translate those lofty goals into\r\nreality on the ground. Positive action, rather than\r\neloquent speech, must become the defining quality of\r\nthe United Nations in the third millennium.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Frederick A. Mitchell, M.P., Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Public Service of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Bahamas): On behalf of Prime\r\nMinister Perry G. Christie, the Government and the\r\npeople of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, I\r\ncongratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your election to\r\nthe presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. The Bahamas is confident that this\r\nsession will be steered to a fruitful conclusion under\r\nyour able guidance. You and the other members of your\r\nequally competent Bureau may be assured of the full\r\nsupport of the Bahamas in the performance of your\r\nduties. I take this opportunity also to congratulate your\r\npredecessor from the Republic of Korea for his skilful\r\nleadership during the fifty-sixth session.\r\nThe right to self-determination and the full, fair\r\nand unhindered expression of the will of the people are\r\nprinciples held in the highest esteem by the Bahamas.\r\nThe Bahamas looks forward to welcoming the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste to the United\r\nNations when it takes its place in the Assembly in just\r\na few weeks. The Bahamas is also pleased to welcome\r\nSwitzerland to this family of nations.\r\nThe world has agreed that the United Nations is a\r\nplace where nations large and small are equal, where\r\ndisputes of an international character may be resolved\r\npeacefully, and where the use of force is supported\r\nonly in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Bahamas and all other nations represented here\r\nhave signed on to this contract, a contract that, in our\r\nview, is inviolate and must be honoured. This should\r\nnot be a matter of convenience and, in our view,\r\napplies to all nations, large and small. Today, I reaffirm\r\nthe commitment of the Bahamas to the United Nations\r\nCharter and to the Universal Declaration of Human\r\nRights. The Government and the people of the\r\nBahamas believe in the United Nations, and will\r\ncontinue to support it and to uphold the founding\r\nprinciples on which its effectiveness and success\r\ndepends.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law,\r\nand an abiding respect for the right to self-\r\ndetermination, the sovereignty of nations and the right\r\nof people everywhere to expect that their Government,\r\nfreely and democratically elected, will protect their\r\nrights. We urge world leaders to accept that the freely\r\nexpressed will of the people is their sole claim to\r\nlegitimacy and that the will of the people should not be\r\nsubverted by any means. We reject parochialism as a\r\njustification for obfuscating the true intent and will of a\r\npeople as expressed through the ballot box.\r\nThe Government of the Bahamas believes in good\r\ngovernance at all levels as a fundamental human right.\r\nAs an adjunct to that right, we have committed\r\nourselves to deepening our long-standing democratic\r\ntradition. General elections are not the end of the story.\r\nThe citizen must continue to have a role in the\r\ngovernance of the country. Civil society must be\r\nactively encouraged to develop and engage in the\r\naffairs of the country. The Bahamas is committed to\r\nconsulting its people on all matters of national\r\nimportance. This becomes critical as our country\r\nexamines its role and fulfils its obligations to other\r\nMember States on the bilateral and multilateral levels.\r\nThe first anniversary of the 11 September attacks\r\non the World Trade Center in New York and the\r\nPentagon, near Washington, D.C., and the tragedy in\r\nPennsylvania, were commemorated just a few days\r\nago. On that occasion, the Bahamas reiterated its\r\ncondemnation of those acts as attacks on our values\r\nand on our civilization. Such acts must not go\r\nunpunished. We therefore support measures to bring\r\nthe guilty to justice and to prevent similar attacks in all\r\ntheir forms and manifestations. We are resolute in our\r\nviews on this. We pause to remember the families and\r\nfriends in countries around the world who lost loved\r\nones in those attacks.\r\nIn our own country we are seeking to recover\r\nfrom the knock-on effects of the unemployment the\r\nattacks caused. We are taking steps to rebuild our\r\neconomy. We have initiated changes to our domestic\r\nlaw and we have, in the United Nations, the\r\nCommonwealth and the Organization of American\r\nStates, become parties to international conventions to\r\nbolster our capacity to play our necessary role in the\r\nfight against these attacks on our way of life. We will\r\ncontinue to give our full support to international efforts\r\nto eliminate this scourge. At the same time, we are\r\n29\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nkeen to ensure that in this fight the fundamental rights\r\nand freedoms of our citizens are not eroded.\r\nThe Bahamas believes that there is no better\r\nlegacy that we can leave to the generations to come\r\nthan an Earth that is safe and secure and that can\r\nsustain life. We firmly believe that there can be\r\ndevelopment without harm to the environment. We\r\nemphasized that point at the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. The environment is not only\r\nthe biological medium that supports the life of the\r\npeople of the Bahamas, but it is also the central reason\r\nfor our economic success. The Government has\r\ntherefore given high priority to preserving and\r\nprotecting the environment, and has taken practical\r\nsteps to do so.\r\nWe reiterate our concern expressed at the Summit\r\nabout the threat posed to small island developing States\r\nby all manifestations of climate change, including the\r\nrise in sea levels. We have repeatedly expressed our\r\ngrave concern to some of our industrialized partners\r\nabout the trans-shipment of nuclear waste through the\r\nCaribbean and about the disastrous effects it might\r\nhave on the economies of the Bahamas and the\r\nCaribbean. Tourism is our primary industry. An\r\naccident involving spent nuclear fuel will almost\r\ncertainly destroy it. We do not accept that, because the\r\nrisk of accidents is remote, the transhipment of nuclear\r\nwaste should be allowed to continue. We make the\r\nassertion today and ask for the transhipment to cease.\r\nThe Bahamas joins in urging the early ratification\r\nand implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and in\r\nreaffirming its commitment to sustainable development\r\nand to the Political Declaration and the Plan of\r\nImplementation of the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe international community faces a broad range\r\nof political, economic, social and cultural issues. We\r\nhave made inroads, but not sufficient to stem the spiral\r\nof persistence of poverty, hunger, human rights abuses,\r\ncrime and diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, or to\r\naddress the vulnerability of small island developing\r\nStates. The Bahamas is particularly concerned about\r\nHIV/AIDS and the slow progress in fighting the\r\ndisease.\r\nThe critical question on HIV/AIDS and all the\r\nother issues is: Where do we go from here? This body\r\nhas made important commitments to the world. There\r\nare reviews, platforms and programmes of action. Our\r\nrespective publics may be forgiven for their cynicism\r\nand the criticism levelled that the United Nations is a\r\ntalking shop. Our view, however, is that it is better to\r\ntalk than fight. Talking is, in fact, a form of action and\r\nthere is no doubt that, with regard to HIVAIDS,\r\ndiscussion of the problem is central to the solutions.\r\nBut our respective publics are looking for and require\r\nmore immediate money and direct action. We must not\r\nbe accused of inaction in the face of human suffering\r\nand adversity.\r\nWe in the Bahamas have ably demonstrated our\r\ndetermination to play our part in these endeavours. We\r\nhave been credited regionally and internationally for\r\nour model programmes, particularly in respect to our\r\ntreatment of and efforts to control the spread of\r\nHIV/AIDS. We especially wish to thank the World\r\nHealth Organization and the Pan American Health\r\nOrganization, now celebrating its hundredth year, for\r\nthe cooperation they have extended to the Bahamas and\r\nfor their stellar work in the area of international health.\r\nWe wish to commend the recent initiative to provide\r\nantiretroviral drugs to countries of the Caribbean to\r\nassist in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Bahamas is concerned about the present\r\nglobal economic order. We raise questions about\r\nwhether globalization and trade liberalization can\r\nindeed function as vehicles for progressive change in\r\nall countries large and small, developed and\r\ndeveloping. We are committed to adapting to change,\r\nbut at a pace and in a manner and form that are\r\nconsistent with the way we live. The Caribbean\r\nCommunity (CARICOM), of which the Bahamas is a\r\npart, has taken up the challenges of ensuring a degree\r\nof stability among its member countries in the face of\r\nglobalization. But the Bahamas believes that more can\r\nand must be done to assist our Caribbean Community\r\nto adapt to these externally imposed changes through\r\nequitable and sensitive trade policies and by reform of\r\nthe international financial institutions and their lending\r\npractices.\r\nThe Bahamas is the unwitting transit point for\r\nillegal activities: the smuggling of human beings and\r\nthe illicit trade in narcotic drugs. The United States is\r\nthe ultimate target. We are also suffering from\r\nincreased violent crime from guns smuggled into our\r\ncountry from the United States. These guns are\r\nterrorizing our society. The Bahamas is working\r\nclosely with the United States and other neighbouring\r\ncountries to address these issues. There must be a\r\n30\r\nA/57/PV.9\r\nstronger effective action to reduce demand for drugs in\r\nthe receiving country. There must be more effective\r\naction taken to stop the flow of illegal guns.\r\nThe Bahamas has taken an active interest in the\r\npeace and stability of its sister CARICOM State, Haiti.\r\nGiven our longstanding and developing relations with\r\nHaiti, positive steps taken to provide assistance and\r\nsupport for Haiti give us great hope. We are especially\r\npleased with the efforts of the Inter-American\r\nDevelopment Bank to work with the Government of\r\nHaiti to remove the existing financial hurdles that\r\nimpede development efforts. We also welcome the\r\nrecent Organization of American States (OAS)\r\nresolution and the announcement by the United States\r\nthat it would contribute additional resources to the\r\nOAS special mission in Haiti. Illegal migration from\r\nHaiti causes a serious drain on the resources of the\r\nBahamas. In addition to Haitian-Bahamian bilateral\r\nefforts to address this problem, the Bahamas believes\r\nthat targeted international initiatives, with the\r\ncooperation of the Government of Haiti, represent the\r\nbest hope for the Haitian people.\r\nIllegal immigration from Cuba also adversely\r\naffects us. The Bahamas continues to call for the\r\nnormalization of relations between Cuba and the\r\nUnited States of America. We believe that such\r\nnormalization would be central to solving that\r\ndimension of the migration problem.\r\nThe Bahamas welcomes the entry into force of\r\nthe Rome Statute on 1 July 2002 and the establishment\r\nof the International Criminal Court as a critical tool in\r\nthe fight against violations of humanitarian\r\ninternational law and crimes against humanity.\r\nThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian\r\npeople is a matter of concern. There should be peace\r\nbetween them. We support the peaceful settlement of\r\nthis issue in accordance with all applicable United\r\nNations resolutions. Every people deserves to have a\r\nState to call its own in peace and security.\r\nThe Bahamas is concerned about developments in\r\nAfrica. As part of the African diaspora, we wish to see\r\nAfrica prosper, wars cease and equitable policies\r\napplied for all of the many and varied people of that\r\ncontinent.\r\nWe support the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe Bahamas believes that the time has come for us to\r\ntake the hard decisions and to agree to a practical\r\nprogramme of reform that takes fully into account the\r\nneed for equitable membership and for a more\r\ndemocratic and transparent Council.\r\nThe Bahamas is a small country whose voice,\r\nwithout the indispensable forum provided by the\r\nUnited Nations, would be lost or at best ignored. Here,\r\nirrespective of size and wealth, we have the ability to\r\nspeak with equal voice and to vote with equal power on\r\nmatters that affect the quality of our lives today and\r\nthat will impact the type of world that we leave in\r\nplace for future generations. This is why it is vitally\r\nimportant that we preserve and respect the integrity of\r\nthis Organization. Member States are bound to come\r\nhere for redress and should not act unilaterally outside\r\nthe bounds of the Charter. The Bahamas reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations as enshrined in its Charter. I leave the\r\nAssembly with that commitment here today.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
