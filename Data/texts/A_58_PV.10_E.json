Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Van den Berg\r\n(Netherlands), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Domitien Ndayizeye, President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nBurundi.\r\nMr. Domitien Ndayizeye, President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Domitien Ndayizeye,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Burundi, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ndayizeye (spoke in French): Allow\r\nme at the outset, on behalf of my delegation and in my\r\npersonal capacity, to extend my warmest\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on his\r\nelection to preside over our work. My countrys\r\ndelegation and I wish him every success and assure\r\nhim of our full cooperation in bringing his noble\r\nmission to fruition.\r\nI should also like to pay a tribute to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the skill and\r\ncompetence with which he guided the work of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan on the skill and dynamism with\r\nwhich he has led our Organization and on his\r\nunflagging attention to the people of Burundi in\r\nhelping them to emerge from the serious crisis they\r\nhave experienced for the past 10 years.\r\nI should also like to voice our profound gratitude\r\nto the Security Council for its ongoing readiness and\r\nmanifest determination to assist the Government and\r\npeople of Burundi in the quest for a lasting solution\r\nleading to peace and national reconciliation. The\r\nregular visits of the Security Council to my country\r\nhave encouraged the inter-Burundian peace process and\r\nsent a message of hope to a people severely battered by\r\nwar.\r\nSince the signing of the Arusha Peace and\r\nReconciliation Agreement for Burundi on 28 August\r\n2000, the peace process under way in my country has\r\nmade significant progress. Since 1 November 2001, we\r\nhave had transitional institutions uniting all the\r\npolitical factions of the country. Since then, effective\r\nadministrative reforms have been undertaken and\r\nreforms planned for the judiciary are gradually being\r\nmade as funding becomes available.\r\nFurthermore, the people of Burundi and the\r\ninternational community were gratified by the transfer\r\nof power at the highest level of State, which proceeded\r\nsmoothly on 30 April 2003, guaranteeing the\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\ninstitutional framework of the Arusha Agreement. The\r\nTransitional Government of Burundi is now involved in\r\nnegotiations with the armed groups in order to achieve\r\na permanent ceasefire agreement and to ensure its\r\neffective implementation.\r\nThus, on 7 October 2002, we signed a ceasefire\r\nagreement with the factions of the Forces nationales de\r\nlibération-Parti Libération du Peuple Hutu (FNL-\r\nPALIPEHUTU) and the Conseil national pour la\r\ndéfense de la démocratie-Front pour la défense de la\r\ndémocratie (CNDD-FDD), led respectively by Alain\r\nMugabarabona and Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. On\r\n2 December 2002, we signed a similar agreement with\r\nthe principal armed movement of CNDD-FDD led by\r\nPierre Nkurunziza. Today, the Transitional Government\r\nis pursuing negotiations with the latter with a view to\r\nintegrating that group into the Republics transitional\r\ninstitutions, including the Defence and Security Corps,\r\nthe National Assembly, the Senate, the Government\r\nand the Administration. The most recent negotiations\r\nwere those organized in Dar es Salaam on\r\n15 September.\r\nDar es Salaam served as the context and\r\nopportunity for the presentation and consideration of\r\nthe strong and effective positions of all concerned.\r\nAbove all, it provided an opportunity to exchange\r\nviews and to understand and reaffirm the importance of\r\nthe central focus of the Arusha Peace and\r\nReconciliation Agreement for Burundi and for taking\r\ninto consideration the national realities that will ensure\r\nthe maintenance of stability. We refer in particular to\r\nrespect for the allocations agreed in Arusha; the\r\ngranting of visibility to CNDD-FDD in the institutions,\r\nwhile avoiding a raising of the stakes and the exclusion\r\nof others; the equitable sharing of power; respect for\r\nthe rights of citizens; and so on.\r\nA summit of heads of State was then planned on\r\nvery short notice to arrive at the conclusions and\r\ncompromises necessary to the signing of the protocol\r\nfor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement of\r\n2 December 2002 and for the entry of CNDD-FDD into\r\nthe transitional institutions. We take this opportunity\r\nwarmly to thank the heads of State of the region and\r\ndelegations at that summit for their work leading to the\r\nsteps already undertaken.\r\nThese fairly positive results should not blind us to\r\na number of difficulties facing Burundi today. Indeed,\r\nthe continuation of war is a major obstacle to\r\nimplementing planned reform, even though the\r\nGovernment is sparing no efforts to meet this great\r\nchallenge, and its commitment to implement the\r\nArusha Agreement and ceasefire agreement for peace\r\nand reconciliation in Burundi speaks for itself.\r\nTherefore, we continue to urge leaders of the\r\nregional initiative for Burundi, mediators and the\r\ninternational community to step up their pressure on\r\nPierre Nkurunzizas FDD for a ceasefire and\r\nintegration in institutions, and on Agathon Rwasas\r\nParti pour la libération du peuple Hutu\r\n(PALIPEHUTU) to rejoin without further delay the\r\ntransitional Government of Burundi at the negotiating\r\ntable, the only appropriate forum to voice its claims.\r\nWe also urge the international community to\r\nmake a substantial financial contribution to the African\r\nMission in Burundi, which is crucial to the monitoring\r\nof the ceasefire.\r\nFinally, the Government of Burundi is impatiently\r\nawaiting the establishment of an international judicial\r\ncommission of inquiry in Burundi, whose work will\r\nclearly contribute to helping Burundi to objectively\r\nconfront the crucial issue of the campaign against\r\nimpunity.\r\nAnother major challenge confronting us is\r\neconomic growth and efforts to combat poverty among\r\nour people. Indeed, the people of Burundi are now\r\nliving in unspeakable poverty. Ten years have so\r\nseverely devastated the national economy that we no\r\nlonger have the bare minimum required to sustain\r\nsocial harmony. More than 68 per cent of the\r\npopulation of Burundi is living beneath the poverty\r\nlevel.\r\nOf course, we approve of efforts already made by\r\nthe international community to ensure the survival of\r\nmy country. But we also ask it to make further efforts\r\nto quickly fulfil the promises made in Paris and\r\nGeneva.\r\nI am pleased to say that the peace process in my\r\ncountry is now developing in a propitious subregional\r\nenvironment recently characterized by significant\r\nprogress in the peace process in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo and a democratic breakthrough\r\nin Rwanda.\r\nThat positive change should lead to the definitive\r\nend to conflicts and also make possible the\r\ninternational conference on the Great Lakes region,\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nwhich the Government of Burundi so ardently hopes\r\nwill take place.\r\nWe wish to see the peace that we seek for\r\nBurundi and its neighbours spread to the entire world.\r\nDuring the Millennium Assembly in September 2000,\r\nheads of State and Government agreed, inter alia, to\r\nspare no effort to save our peoples from the scourge of\r\nwar, whether it be civil war or war between States. A\r\ndecision was also made to increase the effectiveness of\r\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity and to take concerted steps to combat\r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nOn the one hand, we can justly welcome the\r\ncommitment made by the leaders of the entire world to\r\nwork for a better planet, and we commend the\r\nsomewhat positive results in restoring international\r\npeace and security. On the other hand, our collective\r\nconscience places obligations on us all and requires\r\nsustained vigilance and efforts in the face of persistent\r\nand serious setbacks endured here and there on the path\r\nto international peace and security. Indeed, the world of\r\nthe twenty-first century has not been spared from the\r\ndangers of war, poverty, terrorism, disease and natural\r\ndisasters.\r\nThe efforts to combat terrorism that were stepped\r\nup by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001) have\r\nhad mixed results thus far, in view of the frequency and\r\nviciousness of terrorist acts throughout the world, from\r\nwhich even our outstanding Organization is not spared.\r\nThese terrorist attacks have done much to contribute to\r\nmaintaining a general trend towards over-reliance on\r\nthe military and the strengthening of doctrines based on\r\npreventive attacks, a concept that continues to fuel\r\npolitical and diplomatic debate.\r\nDespite the ever-increasing commitment of the\r\nUnited Nations and regional and subregional\r\norganizations, hotbeds of tension among or within\r\nStates have not yet been extinguished and calls for war\r\nare enduring and threatening, like the sword of\r\nDamocles. Mercenaries are increasingly being used as\r\ntools to destabilize sovereign and independent States.\r\nThe threat of nuclear war continues to loom over us\r\nand poison international relations.\r\nTrafficking in human beings, a true form of\r\nslavery in the twenty-first century, particularly with\r\nrespect to the child labour market, child prostitution,\r\nthe use of children as cannon fodder in conflicts and\r\nillegal migration continue to be a reality to this day.\r\nAll these abuses have as a common denominator\r\nan attack on human rights and international\r\nhumanitarian law that the Member States of the United\r\nNations are duty-bound to champion side by side\r\nwithin the framework of multilateralism, one of the\r\nmost cherished principles of our Organization.\r\nIn light of the impression that we are\r\nexperiencing a genuine crisis in the architecture of\r\npeace-building and international security, intelligent\r\nreform of institutions entrusted with the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security is urgently needed\r\nto better enable them to meet the security needs of our\r\ntime.\r\nAbove all, the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly, the most representative organ of the United\r\nNations, must be tirelessly pursued. Careful\r\nconsideration should make the General Assembly much\r\nmore operational and streamlined with respect to its\r\nworking methods and, in particular, to impartial\r\nfollow-up and implementation of its resolutions and\r\ndecisions.\r\nReform of the Security Council in all its aspects\r\nalso continues to be a top priority for us, as the\r\nMillennium Declaration stressed, to meet the concerns\r\nabout the regional balance of its membership. The\r\ncredibility of the Council and our Organization are at\r\nstake here.\r\nMoreover, multilateralism must remain a common\r\npillar for us all, as one of the fundamental values that\r\nshould underpin international relations in the\r\nframework of active solidarity and shared\r\nresponsibilities, under the aegis of our Organization.\r\nWe also appeal for regular voluntary financing of\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and support\r\nfor mechanisms of regional and subregional conflict-\r\nprevention and promotion of political stability, with\r\nparticular attention given to Africa.\r\nThere is no need to recall that our world is\r\nincreasingly characterized by growing\r\ninterdependence, conflicts, pandemics and natural\r\ndisasters that have repercussions that know no borders\r\nbetween States. Economic and social imbalances that\r\nresult from the unfair and non-inclusive international\r\nfinancial structure prevent us from efficiently tackling\r\ntodays very complex challenges. The needs and\r\ninterests of developing countries have not been\r\nsufficiently taken into account. The gulf between rich\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nand poor is widening. We therefore have a common\r\nduty to establish an environment that will benefit all\r\npoor peoples.\r\nWith respect to cooperation for development, the\r\nfight against poverty remains a priority. Attaining the\r\ngoals set at the international level during major\r\nconferences and summits involves the elimination of\r\npoverty and hunger, in particular in rural areas.\r\nThis implies, among other things, significant\r\ninvestment in the agricultural and rural sectors geared\r\ntowards increasing production and protecting the\r\nenvironment. We are all aware that, in order to be\r\nsuccessful, the development efforts of poor countries\r\nrequire multifaceted international support. To that end,\r\nthe commitments undertaken at the Monterrey\r\nconference regarding aid to development are\r\nencouraging, but we must promptly move from good\r\nintentions to specific deeds.\r\nThe least developed countries have weak and\r\nmarginalized economies within the international\r\nfinancial system. They therefore require particular\r\nattention in terms of official development assistance,\r\ndirect foreign investment, debt relief, the strengthening\r\nof capacities and access to international markets. We\r\nalso urge the international community to advance the\r\nintegral implementation of the Almaty plan of action as\r\na response to the specific difficulties linked to the\r\ndistance to the sea and to high costs of transportation\r\nthat seriously handicap the economic development of\r\nlandlocked countries.\r\nAfrica is the continent where the ills of\r\ndestitution have attained an alarming level. In a shared\r\nimpetus, Africans have created the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development (NEPAD). The warm welcome\r\nthe international community gave to NEPAD must be\r\nbacked by concrete gestures of solidarity. Thus, the\r\nspirit of partnership, which also entails the active\r\nparticipation of local authorities and associations of\r\ncivil society, can, in fact, become a reality and allow\r\nour continent to benefit from its immense riches down\r\nto a grassroots level.\r\nThe rules of the World Trade Organization need\r\nto be made more flexible to allow developing countries\r\nto benefit from the liberalization of world trade. The\r\ninitiatives already undertaken along these lines in Doha\r\ndeserve to be further intensified. There is a need to end\r\nall forms of subsidies for products exported from rich\r\ncountries, which lead to distorted exchange rates, as\r\nwell as various non-tariff obstacles. The international\r\ncommunity must also work to remedy the instability of\r\nthe prices of commodities, which are the major source\r\nof revenue for poor countries.\r\nAnother major challenge is overcoming the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and halting malaria and\r\ntuberculosis in tropical countries. AIDS is a threat to\r\nmankind. It is devastating entire populations, making\r\nmillions of children defenceless orphans and\r\nswallowing up all development efforts. Faced with this\r\ncommon danger, urgent action is necessary. We herald\r\nthe establishment in January 2002 of the Global Fund\r\nto combat these three scourges, and we urge those\r\ncountries that have the financial and scientific means to\r\ndo so to step up their efforts to limit and ultimately\r\nstamp out those disasters.\r\nI would not like to end without emphasizing\r\nagain the critical role that the United Nations Charter\r\nbestows on our Organization in its sacred mission of\r\nhumanizing international relations each day and\r\ncontributing to building a better world. The obstacles\r\nin the path of the United Nations are not inevitable;\r\nrather, they are an opportunity to meet new challenges\r\nand adapt the Organization to achieve the objectives of\r\nthe Charter and those of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Burundi for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Domitien Ndayizeye, President of the\r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Svetozar Marović, President of\r\nSerbia and Montenegro\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear\r\nan address by the President of Serbia and Montenegro.\r\nMr. Svetozar Marović, President of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Svetozar Marović,\r\nPresident of Serbia and Montenegro, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Marović: I am honoured to address\r\nyou for the first time on behalf of the State Union of\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nSerbia and Montenegro. The State Union of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro was created in the interest of peace,\r\nstability, the democratic right to freedom of choice and\r\nmoving quickly to a European track. We have assumed\r\nthe responsibility for a policy of non-compromise in\r\nthe Balkans. We have assumed the responsibility to\r\ndemonstrate that in the region that used to be burdened\r\nwith divisions and conflicts it is possible to work out\r\nan agreement that will push us forward together.\r\nWe are certain that our lives can be better if all of\r\nus in the region commit to that goal, if all of us in the\r\nregion look to the future and if all of us in the region\r\nlook to Europe and other people who share the same\r\ngoals. That is why we are sure that life can be better for\r\nall peoples.\r\nWith this hope, we agree with all who perceive\r\nterrorism as one of the greatest evils facing the world\r\ntoday. We can defeat terrorism only if we all join\r\nforces. That is why, for us, there is no alternative to\r\nmultilateralism, and the United Nations is the guarantor\r\nfor that, both today and tomorrow.\r\nTerrorism is not a problem only for the rich\r\ncountries, as the Secretary-General said yesterday. It is\r\na problem for every man and every country, just as it is\r\na problem for parents who lost their children just\r\nbecause they chose to swim in a river and belonged to a\r\ndifferent religion and nationality. We deplore the\r\ndeaths of those children, the same as we deplore the\r\nterrorist attack in Baghdad, which caused the death of\r\ninnocent people, among them Sergio Vieira de Mello.\r\nWe condemn these deaths as all humane, civilized and\r\nprogressive people do. But that is not enough. We must\r\nstrive to ensure that such things happen no more.\r\nThe activities of the United Nations in Kosovo\r\ndemonstrate that with good intentions on all sides there\r\nis hope for creating preconditions for dialogue, instead\r\nof hatred and conflicts, so that people discuss and\r\nresolve their problems instead of creating new ones.\r\nWe are glad that one of the crucial issues for the\r\nstability of this region  that of Kosovo  is on the\r\nthreshold of dialogue, as we have called for.\r\nWe have been encouraged by the announcements\r\nof representatives of the United Nations that the\r\ndialogue between Belgrade and Pristina could start by\r\nmid-October and that it has been supported within the\r\ncontact group. I hope that it will also be supported in\r\nPristina, as it is supported in Belgrade. In this\r\nundertaking as well, the role of the United Nations and\r\nits representative in Kosovo is extremely important.\r\nFor its part, Serbia and Montenegro will do its\r\nutmost to ensure the success of the dialogue. This is an\r\nopportunity that we must take advantage of, in the\r\ninterest of the European and democratic future of the\r\nregion. We have to be patient and persistent.\r\nWe are aware that we cannot change the past. But\r\nwe can do a great deal to improve our present and\r\nfuture. We seek peace for all people left without their\r\nhomes. There are more than 650,000 of them in Serbia\r\nand Montenegro, and we want them to live where they\r\nbelieve they belong. I am sure that within the\r\nframework of the tripartite agreement with Croatia and\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina we shall soon find a common\r\nsolution that will ultimately resolve that problem.\r\nFrom our own recent experience we know a lot\r\nabout victims and suffering. That is why we call for an\r\nend to violence in all parts of the world  in Baghdad\r\nand Iraq, and the Middle East. We are convinced that\r\nthe international community and the United Nations,\r\nprimarily the Security Council, will find a way to\r\nstabilization and to a life in peace and freedom for all\r\npeople. The human race has only one world to live in.\r\nWe in Serbia and Montenegro stand ready to contribute\r\nto peace efforts through peace operations, to protect\r\npeace and to defend each nations right to a democratic\r\nfuture.\r\nOf course, we are primarily committed to the\r\nstabilization of the situation in the region of the\r\nWestern Balkans, cooperation among the countries in\r\nthe region, the fight against organized crime and full\r\ncooperation with the Hague Tribunal. No crime should\r\nbe left unpunished, and all perpetrators should be\r\nbrought to justice. Our goal is to join the process of\r\nEuropean integration as soon as possible, as well as the\r\nPartnership for Peace. The Thessaloniki summit of the\r\nEuropean Union and the countries of the Western\r\nBalkans defined clear goals. Serbia and Montenegro\r\nwill not let go of this chance for a European future. We\r\nhave a responsibility to create a better, more peaceful\r\nand dignified life for generations to come.\r\nThat is an obligation not only for us in Serbia and\r\nThat is a motive and force keeping us together in the\r\nUnited Nations to do all we can so that good may\r\nprevail over evil, peace over conflicts, democracy over\r\ndictatorship and economic prosperity over poverty. We\r\ncan do it together. This is not a utopia; it is a realistic\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\npossibility which will be successful to the extent we\r\nare able to work together. Serbia and Montenegro trusts\r\nit can be done.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Svetozar Marović, President of Serbia and\r\nMontenegro, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Boris Trajkovski, President of The\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear\r\nan address by the President of The former Yugoslav\r\nRepublic of Macedonia.\r\nMr. Boris Trajkovski, President of The former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Boris Trajkovski, President\r\nof The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to\r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Trajkovski: I am greatly honoured to\r\naddress this distinguished gathering of the worlds\r\nleaders at the United Nations, a truly unique global\r\norganization that is deeply engaged in the promotion of\r\nhuman values and international peace and stability.\r\nI would like to thank Mr. Jan Kavan for his\r\nimportant contribution in the past year as President of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on his election to\r\nthe post of President of the General Assembly at the\r\nfifty-eighth session. I wish him every success in\r\nexecuting that function of great responsibility.\r\nOn behalf of all citizens of the Republic of\r\nMacedonia, I would like to pay special tribute to the\r\nUnited Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\r\nwho delivered an indeed inspiring speech yesterday, for\r\ntheir relentless dedication and efforts in pursuing the\r\nrighteous causes of protecting human rights and\r\nfreedoms and safeguarding prosperity and security in\r\nthe world.\r\nWe certainly remember a great person, Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, who paid the highest price for\r\npursuing the noble role of the United Nations in Iraq.\r\nWe fully support the goals of the international\r\ncommunity in Iraq: the achievement of a free and\r\nsovereign Iraq governed by the people of Iraq for the\r\npeople of Iraq. However, that sovereignty must be\r\nbased on democracy, freedom and peaceful existence\r\nwith its neighbours. To achieve those goals as quickly\r\nas possible, the United Nations must play a more\r\ncomprehensive and active role in the transition back to\r\nIraqi sovereignty. I would also like to take this\r\noccasion to express our satisfaction with the work\r\ncarried out by the coalition forces in helping the Iraqi\r\npeople to rebuild their country after the decades of\r\ndisasters of Saddam Husseins despotic regime.\r\nReforming the United Nations, particularly the\r\nSecurity Council, and revitalizing the General\r\nAssembly are of crucial importance to us all. My\r\nGovernment firmly believes in the need to pursue those\r\ngoals in a consistent and more efficient way.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia strongly believes the\r\nUnited Nations involvement in various parts of the\r\nworld will essentially improve the responses of\r\ndemocratically oriented Governments and reform-\r\nminded people and will add to the overall level of\r\nlegitimacy of their actions. It is obvious that we need to\r\noffer more vocal support to multilateralism when\r\ndealing with the substantial issues on the international\r\nagenda to which we are fully committed: the\r\neradication of poverty, the fight against the scourge of\r\nHIV/AIDS around the world, conflict prevention and\r\nthe protection of the environment, among others.\r\nThe World Summit on the Information Society, to\r\nbe held in Geneva this year and in Tunis 2005, along\r\nwith two other summits held last year on financing for\r\ndevelopment in Monterrey, Mexico, and sustainable\r\ndevelopment in Johannesburg, can be regarded, in the\r\ncontext of globalization and the overall development\r\nprocess, as landmarks of a new approach in dealing\r\nwith the challenges of todays world. Within the\r\naforementioned framework, it is essential fully to\r\nimplement the Millennium Declaration as a key\r\ndocument for peace, security, sustainable development\r\nand prosperity.\r\nThe most serious contemporary threat to\r\nhumanity is identified and visible. It is the evil of\r\nterrorism. The fight against terrorism has been and\r\nmust remain our highest priority. In this regard, it\r\nwould be immensely helpful to make a commitment to\r\nreaching a consensus in relation to the remaining\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\ndisputed points in the process of drafting conventions\r\non international and nuclear terrorism.\r\nFacing the challenge of the year 2001, we found a\r\nway out by signing the Framework Agreement that\r\nbrought vital democratic processes back to our\r\ninstitutions and re-established and reaffirmed\r\ndemocratic procedures for addressing internal problems\r\nof any kind. Today, I am very proud to say that I come\r\nhere in the same mood I was in three years ago when I\r\ntook part in the Millennium Summit  full of\r\noptimism and truly convinced that, after the hard work\r\nhad been done, strategic issues of our future had been\r\nsolved, once and for all, upon a broad political, social\r\nand interethnic consensus. Progress towards a real and\r\nauthentic integration of all ethnic communities in the\r\nState structures is significant and has roots in our\r\ncenturies-old model and tradition of multiculturalism\r\nand inter-ethnic coexistence.\r\nIn order to contribute in a constructive way to\r\ncreating a more positive picture of the region and\r\nproductive cooperation among nations, the Republic of\r\nMacedonia launched numerous regional initiatives in\r\nthe context of integration into the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization and the European Union. In parallel,\r\nwhile pursuing very ambitious reform agendas, we\r\nachieved an internal consensus about our foreign policy\r\npriorities and realized that we will most successfully\r\nleave behind the poor legacies of our unfortunate past\r\nby promoting new substantial links among the people\r\nwho live in South-East Europe.\r\nA month ago in Ohrid, we held a very successful\r\nregional forum on dialogue among civilizations,\r\nattended by numerous heads of State, other leaders and\r\nscholars from all over the world, who spoke very\r\nopenly about the importance of having cultural\r\ninterchange as a permanent basis for the promotion of\r\ncontinuous dialogue and cohabitation among peoples\r\nand States. In the message adopted at the forum, all\r\nparticipants agreed that a thorough and continuous\r\ncommitment would be needed by all to genuinely\r\ntransform our region and to defuse once and for all this\r\npowder keg of Europe.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia has built solid\r\ncooperation with the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and\r\ndeveloped a network of activities aimed at easing\r\ncommunications and at liberalizing the movement of\r\npeople from both sides of the border. The Republic of\r\nMacedonia welcomes the appointment of Harri Holkeri\r\nas the new Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and gives him its full support. We are fully\r\nsupportive of the implementation of Security Council\r\nresolution 1244 (1999) and the political position\r\ndeclared by UNMIK calling for the fulfilment of the\r\nstandards of democracy and the application of the rule\r\nof law before the onset of negotiations over the final\r\nstatus of Kosovo. We express our deep concern over\r\nthe recent upsurge of inter-ethnic violence in Kosovo,\r\nwhich only undermines the efforts of the international\r\ncommunity and the Kosovar people to fulfil the set\r\nstandards.\r\nIn the Balkans, we are seeing collaboration and\r\nmutual respect emerging even between yesterdays\r\nenemies and opposing factions. We are witnessing the\r\ngradual but steady reconciliation of the nations. Last\r\nbut not least, important regional initiatives for free\r\ntrade, trade facilitation and building infrastructure are\r\nconnecting businesses and binding people in a\r\nproductive way, which helps to raise awareness of our\r\ncommon future.\r\nMy country, the Republic of Macedonia, is an\r\nindivisible part of these joint regional efforts to\r\ntransform our part of the continent into a decent place\r\nto live in. To that end, we will need the understanding\r\nand concrete support of the rest of the world\r\ncommunity, which should not neglect the call of\r\nprogressive people to join efforts to secure liberty. We\r\nbelieve that the greatness of countries is dependent not\r\nupon the size of their armies and the number of\r\nweapons they possess, but upon the commitment and\r\ndedication of their citizens to the noble ideas of\r\nhumanity and the legacy of our civilization. In this\r\ntremendous task of preserving our common treasury\r\nand of creating a better world for the generations to\r\ncome, we are more than willing to participate, because\r\nwe are all equal to each other, while contributing to the\r\ncommon aim.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the escalation of\r\nviolence in the Middle East. The parties need to\r\nrecommit themselves to the road map process, because\r\nit is the only alternative that can bring security and\r\nstability to Israelis and Palestinians alike. The\r\ninternational community must step up its activities at\r\nthis extremely difficult juncture, ensuring that it\r\nremains on the path of ending terrorism and occupation\r\nand of establishing the State of Palestine, living side by\r\nside with the State of Israel in peace and security.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nOn disarmament matters, bearing in mind our\r\nimmediate concerns over the problem of small arms\r\nand light weapons, the Republic of Macedonia has\r\nbeen an advocate of strong international action towards\r\npreventing, combating and eradicating the illicit trade\r\nin small arms and light weapons, since these pose a\r\nserious threat not only to the security and stability of\r\nmy country, but also to the broader region. We\r\nwelcome the conclusion of the First Biennial Meeting\r\nof States to Consider the Implementation of the United\r\nNations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons in All its Aspects, held in July 2003, that\r\nprogress had been made worldwide within barely two\r\nyears of the adoption of the Programme of Action.\r\nFor the African countries, the main priority at this\r\nmoment is the fight against HIV/AIDS, a pandemic\r\nthat is taking a devastating toll on the African\r\npopulation. The international community must work\r\nhand in hand with the African Governments to defeat\r\nthis deadly disease. Africa must also work very hard to\r\nachieve the strategic goals of the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development in the areas of peace and\r\nsecurity, democracy, good governance, poverty\r\nreduction and sound economic management.\r\nI sincerely believe that we will find a common\r\nlanguage with regard to the issue of how to strengthen\r\nour Organization and maintain its mission of peace,\r\nprosperity, economic and social justice and human\r\nrights.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of The former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Boris Trajkovski, President of The former\r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Leonid Kuchma, President of\r\nUkraine\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Leonid Kuchma, President of Ukraine, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Leonid Kuchma, President\r\nof Ukraine, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kuchma (spoke in Ukrainian; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): I should like at the\r\noutset to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his election\r\nto the high post of President of the General Assembly\r\nat its fifty-eighth session. I should also like to pay\r\ntribute to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his\r\nprofessionalism and very fruitful work at the helm of\r\nthe General Assembly during the previous session.\r\nThree years ago here at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters we solemnly adopted the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, which embodied our hopes and\r\nexpectations for a more secure and just world. Shortly\r\nthereafter, however, the world had to face new and\r\ndaunting challenges. Unfortunately, the tragic events of\r\n11 September 2001 were not the last in a sequence of\r\nhorrible acts of terror.\r\nJust last month, on 19 August, the United Nations\r\nsuffered irreplaceable losses in Iraq. With a feeling of\r\ndeep sorrow, I bow my head in memory of the United\r\nNations staff who lost their lives. We lost excellent,\r\ntalented and dedicated people, among them the Head of\r\nthe United Nations Mission in Iraq, the outstanding\r\nBrazilian diplomat Sergio Vieira de Mello.\r\nIt is a sad and disturbing fact that during recent\r\nyears United Nations staff have been facing growing\r\ninsecurity. This makes it all the more urgent for all\r\nmembers of the international community to fully\r\ncomply with the relevant international treaties, first and\r\nforemost, the Convention on the Safety of United\r\nNations and Associated Personnel. As one of the\r\ninitiators of that Convention, Ukraine decisively calls\r\nupon all States that have not yet done so to accede to\r\nthe treaty.\r\nOur country joined the anti-terrorist coalition at\r\nthe very outset and has made a significant contribution\r\nto its activities. We are determined to remain in the\r\nranks of the coalition until international terrorism as a\r\nglobal threat can be taken off the worlds agenda. I\r\nbelieve, however, that not everything has been done to\r\ndate to prevent terrorist activities.\r\nI have in mind first of all effective measures to\r\ncounter the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. Ukraine unreservedly stands for a\r\ncomprehensive strengthening of the system of universal\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\ninternational treaties aimed at preventing the nuclear\r\nthreat.\r\nAn effective response to new challenges requires\r\nurgent action to reform the United Nations, first and\r\nforemost the Security Council. I am confident that\r\nfurther delay in the long-overdue reforms could result\r\nin a serious crisis of confidence for the United Nations.\r\nWe cannot let that happen. There can be no viable\r\nalternative to the United Nations as a unique global\r\nOrganization. As for the task of reforming the United\r\nNations, we must admit that today there are more\r\nquestions than there are answers.\r\nIn this context, the successful reforms in the area\r\nof United Nations activities for peacekeeping and\r\nconflict prevention can serve as a good example for all\r\nof us. In many situations of armed conflict, the United\r\nNations now acts flexibly, rapidly and effectively. I am\r\npleased to note that over the past several years Ukraine\r\nhas been playing a leading role among the countries\r\ncontributing troops to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations. I believe that conflict prevention should\r\nbecome a key element of the philosophy of the work of\r\nthe United Nations in the new millennium. Ukraine\r\nfully supports the Secretary-Generals efforts aimed at\r\nstrengthening that component of United Nations\r\nactivities.\r\nIn my address at the Millennium Summit, I\r\nstressed the need for the international community to\r\nelaborate a comprehensive strategy on conflict\r\nprevention. In my opinion, peacekeeping operations\r\nwith a preventive mandate from the Security Council\r\ncould become one of the key instruments of such a\r\nsystem. We also need to further develop and improve\r\nthe principles and mechanisms relating to the\r\napplication of international sanctions aimed at curbing\r\nthe supply of weapons to conflict zones.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Iraq, I would like\r\nto express confidence that the tragic losses in Baghdad\r\nwill not diminish the international communitys\r\ncommitment to providing support to the Iraqi people\r\nfor the renewal of their country. The sense of common\r\nresponsibility for the destiny of the long-suffering Iraqi\r\nnation and for peace and security in that region was the\r\nimperative that guided our decision to dispatch a\r\nmilitary contingent to the Persian Gulf.\r\nI hope that the adoption by the Security Council\r\nof a resolution on the establishment of an international\r\nforce for the maintenance of peace and security in Iraq\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations will enable as\r\nmany countries as possible to join those efforts.\r\nAfter many months of a slide towards the abyss, a\r\ntruly historic opportunity arose for achieving peace in\r\nthe Middle East. Last May, the United Nations\r\nInternational Meeting in Support of Middle East Peace\r\nwas held in Kiev at the initiative of Ukraine. It became,\r\nin effect, the first international forum at which the road\r\nmap put forward by the Quartet gained the support of a\r\nlarge number of States Members of the United Nations.\r\nWe sincerely hope that the resumption of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian peace dialogue will not be blocked by\r\nobstacles created by the current controversies.\r\nUkraine shares the concern expressed in the\r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Declaration that the international\r\ncommunity is not paying sufficient attention to trying\r\nto resolve the chronic global development problems\r\nsuch as poverty, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, environment\r\npollution and other issues. Despite repeated\r\ndeclarations  primarily by the developed countries \r\nof their readiness to increase the volume of financial\r\nand other assistance to tackle issues of sustainable\r\ndevelopment, the actual efforts that have been\r\nundertaken have not been sufficient for the timely\r\nattainment of the goals set forth in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nIn this context, I would like to recall that Ukraine\r\nmade a tangible contribution towards a peaceful and\r\nsafe world in the twenty-first century by renouncing its\r\nnuclear arsenal  one of the most powerful on\r\nEarth  and by decommissioning the Chernobyl\r\nnuclear power plant. In assuming the burden of the\r\nlarge-scale effort to transform the area of the\r\ncatastrophe into an ecologically safe zone and to\r\nresolve unprecedented economic, social and\r\nhumanitarian problems, we relied upon the\r\nunderstanding and support of the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nToday, welcoming the work of this Organization\r\nand its Member States with regard to the\r\nimplementation of the United Nations strategy on\r\nChernobyl, I express the hope that more decisive steps\r\nwill be taken in support of our efforts. I am confident\r\nthat the adoption of a resolution on this question at the\r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly will provide\r\nadditional impetus for our cooperation on the\r\nChernobyl issue.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nFinally, I would like to draw the attention of the\r\nparticipants of this meeting to one other matter.\r\nSeventy years ago the totalitarian Soviet regime\r\nengineered an artificial famine in Ukraine, which\r\nclaimed the lives of between 7 million and 10 million\r\nof our compatriots.\r\nUnfortunately, the world did not respond to our\r\ntragedy back in 1933. The international community\r\nbelieved the cynical propaganda of the Soviet Union,\r\nwhich was selling bread abroad while, in Ukraine,\r\nhunger was killing 17 people every minute. From this\r\nrostrum, I should like to call upon all Members to\r\nsupport Ukraines initiative that the United Nations pay\r\ntribute to the memory of those who perished. We do\r\nnot want to settle scores from the past; we simply want\r\nas many people as possible to learn about our tragedy.\r\nThat knowledge will help us to avoid similar\r\ncatastrophes in the future.\r\nAs the Secretary-General recently stated  and\r\nquite rightly  thanks to the past centurys\r\nachievements, the world became a world of increasing\r\nopenness and freedom; of growing mutual confidence;\r\nabove all, a world of hope. Today, we are\r\ndemonstrating the ability to take concerted and\r\nresponsible action in the face of conflicts, challenges\r\nand global threats. In that, the principal guarantee I see\r\nis that we will be able to achieve the noble goals\r\nsolemnly proclaimed three years ago in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ukraine for\r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Leonid Kuchma, President of Ukraine, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the\r\nRepublic of Senegal\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of\r\nSenegal.\r\nMr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of\r\nSenegal, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdoulaye Wade,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Wade (spoke in French): As a Vice-\r\nPresident at this session, Senegal, through me,\r\nexpresses to the President its heartfelt congratulations\r\non his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth regular session. In that\r\nelection, I see a mark of confidence and a tribute to his\r\nwonderful country, Saint Lucia, but also to our entire\r\nsister community, the countries members of the\r\nCaribbean Community. He may therefore be assured of\r\nSenegals full cooperation in the exercise of his\r\nimportant duties. Let me also express my sincere\r\nthanks to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech\r\nRepublic, for the decisive results achieved during his\r\nterm of office.\r\nI should like to express my fraternal and friendly\r\ngreetings to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\r\nand to tell him how proud I am of the spirit of\r\ninitiative, commitment and resolve that he has\r\ndisplayed with vigour and determination in his noble\r\nmission in the service of our common aspirations to\r\npeace, universalism and solidarity.\r\nIt is precisely in the name of those shared ideals\r\nthat my country, Senegal, reaffirms once again its\r\nfervent support for the readmission of the Republic of\r\nChina on Taiwan as a full-fledged Member of the\r\nUnited Nations. By doing that  without calling into\r\nquestion the participation and the legitimate status of\r\nany other Member of the great United Nations\r\nfamily  we would do justice to that countrys 23\r\nmillion hard-working and disciplined inhabitants,\r\ndeeply attached to the values of peace, freedom and\r\ndemocracy enshrined in the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nTwo years ago, on 11 September 2001, the world\r\ndiscovered the new face of international terrorism,\r\nright here and in all its horror. Certainly, other bloody\r\nattacks have taken place, here and elsewhere, before\r\nand since those tragic events; even the United Nations\r\nhas not been spared. The attack that cost the life of\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights, and those of many other United Nations\r\nstaff, is a sinister reminder that the terrorist threat is\r\nnow global in its targets and pernicious in its means of\r\naction. Indeed, a defender of human rights has been\r\ndeprived of the most basic human right: the right\r\nto life.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nConsequently, a collective, united, coordinated\r\nresponse is required at all levels. In that spirit, Senegal\r\ntook the initiative on 17 October 2001 to call for an\r\nAfrican anti-terrorism summit with a view to\r\nstrengthening cooperation in that regard at the\r\ncontinental level, thus joining its efforts with the\r\nAlgiers Convention on the Prevention and Combating\r\nof Terrorism. It is still our conviction that Africa must\r\nnot remain the soft underbelly of the system that is\r\ngradually being established to combat international\r\nterrorism in all its forms, in the wake of the armed\r\nconflicts and the humanitarian tragedies that have been\r\ncausing bloodshed in the world.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Africa, Senegal\r\nsalutes the significant progress achieved in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia.\r\nThose two friendly countries, afflicted by so many\r\nyears of civil war, seem at last to have embarked on the\r\npath of negotiation and dialogue, an essential condition\r\nfor a definitive return to peace. Moreover, Senegal\r\nwelcomes the Security Councils decision to send a\r\npeacekeeping force to Liberia in support of the troops\r\nof the Economic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS), including the Senegalese troops already in\r\nplace.\r\nIn the sisterly Republic of Côte dIvoire, Senegal\r\nwelcomes the progress made in the national\r\nreconciliation process on the basis of the Linas-\r\nMarcoussis Agreements, in the hope that the incident\r\nthat occurred two days ago will prove to be only a\r\nhitch. I encourage my Ivorian sisters and brothers to\r\npersevere on the path of reconciliation, cooperation and\r\nmutual confidence in order to safeguard that countrys\r\nnational unity and territorial integrity with the help of\r\nthe ECOWAS interposition force under Senegalese\r\ncommand.\r\nIn many respects, sources of concern persist on\r\nthe continent, particularly in West Africa, formerly\r\nknown for its stability. I am thinking in particular of\r\nthose who would call into question democratically\r\nelected regimes. We must say forcefully that the time\r\nmust be past for coups détat in Africa. Everyone must\r\nunderstand from now on that legitimate power, whose\r\nsole agent remains the people, cannot be acquired,\r\npreserved or transferred except by means of the ballot\r\nbox  that is, through the force of law, not the law of\r\nforce or that of weapons.\r\nSenegal, for its part, is complying strictly with\r\nthe Declaration of Algiers of 1999, which enshrines the\r\nprinciple of excluding from the proceedings of the\r\nAfrican Union any regime established in violation of\r\ninternal constitutional order. Last July, it was on the\r\nbasis of that Declaration and thanks to the vigorous\r\nreaction of African countries  including mine  that\r\nconstitutional legality was re-established only a few\r\ndays after a coup détat in Sao Tome and Principe. That\r\nexample  that precedent  should serve as a lesson\r\nto anyone who might yet be tempted by this practice,\r\nwhich runs counter to democratic values.\r\nOnly 10 days ago in Guinea-Bissau, a\r\ndemocratically elected President was deposed by a\r\ngroup of officers. As soon as I was informed of this, I\r\ncited the position of the African Union in calling for\r\nthe military to relinquish power. President Kufuor,\r\nChairman of the Economic Community of West\r\nAfrican States; President Chissano, President of the\r\nAfrican Union; President Obasanjo of Nigeria; and I\r\nimmediately took the situation in hand. This led to the\r\nestablishment of an entirely civilian Government. From\r\nthis rostrum, I should like to make a solemn appeal to\r\nthe international community. Guinea-Bissau, a fraternal\r\ncountry bordering on Senegal, needs immediate\r\nassistance. Only diligent and consistent economic\r\nassistance can create the conditions for a lasting return\r\nto social peace and political and institutional stability\r\nin that country.\r\nAs Chairman of the United Nations Committee on\r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian\r\nPeople, Senegal remains gravely concerned by the\r\ndeadlock in the peace process in the Middle East. Too\r\nmuch blood has been shed and too much suffering\r\nendured in that land holy to the three great revealed\r\nreligions. And yet, one must face the fact that a\r\npeaceful solution is the sole, best guarantee of survival\r\nfor all the peoples affected by daily death and anguish.\r\nWe must pursue efforts to ensure a return to the\r\nnegotiating table on the basis of the relevant\r\nresolutions of the Security Council, the principle of\r\nland for peace and the parameters established in the\r\nroad map so that, at last, this long nightmare can yield\r\nto the oft-aborted dream of peoples who cherish peace\r\nand freedom.\r\nHowever, if the words attributed to one Israeli\r\nauthority are well founded, my country would warn\r\nagainst any attack on the physical integrity of President\r\nYasser Arafat and against any decision of expulsion.\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nAny such act would have incalculable consequences.\r\nSenegal rejects and condemns violence in all its forms,\r\nregardless of who the victims and perpetrators may be\r\nor the reasons invoked, and reiterates its unfailing\r\nsupport for the establishment of an independent and\r\nsovereign Palestinian State within secure and\r\ninternationally recognized borders, just as we have\r\nalways recognized Israels right to exist in the same\r\nconditions. I have the feeling, however, that if we\r\nconfine ourselves to issuing statements without making\r\nany real effort to find a concrete solution, the tragedy\r\nthat is unfolding before our eyes in cycles of violence\r\nwill last a very long time.\r\nThe Israeli and Palestinian authorities have asked\r\nme, without my seeking it, to help them to settle this\r\nconflict, which is beginning to look like the Thirty\r\nYears War or even the Hundred Years War. Those\r\nauthorities may recall simply that Senegal has resolved\r\nfor itself one of the greatest contradictions of our time:\r\nthe coexistence in one land of Muslims and Christians,\r\nwho live in a ratio of 95 per cent to 5 per cent in our\r\ncountry. Christians, far from suffering from any\r\ndiscrimination, are fully integrated into national life, to\r\nthe extent that a Christian has been the President of our\r\nRepublic for 20 years and supported by Muslims. That\r\nis why I myself have turned to great thinkers and\r\ntheoreticians on the issue of conflict to see if their\r\nwords might be useful to us.\r\nA compatriot of Jacques Chirac, Mr. Gaston\r\nBoutoul, invented the science of war and, more\r\ngenerally, of conflict known as polemology, the\r\nobjective of which is to understand, through scientific\r\nanalysis, the motivations and mechanisms of war and\r\nconflict. A sociological approach includes individual\r\npsychology, collective and social psychology,\r\neconomics and the environment. I should like to\r\nsubscribe to this approach and, in the light of the\r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, to make a modest\r\ncontribution.\r\nIt seems to me that there are two possible\r\napproaches to the conflict: that of the aggressor\r\naggressed theory and that of the occupier occupied\r\ntheory. If we seek to identify who is in one category\r\nand who is in the other, we find ourselves in a complete\r\nimpasse. Unfortunately, that is what each of the parties\r\nis doing. In the first scenario, Israelis and Palestinians\r\neach claim to be the aggressed and accuse each other of\r\nbeing the aggressor. In the second, while Israel is\r\nundeniably the occupier, it justifies this state of affairs\r\nby pointing to the so-called aggression of Palestinians.\r\nHence, we return to the first theory and set in motion\r\nan endless cycle.\r\nLet us not play this game, which is one of\r\nmassacre for the parties to the conflict and of hide-and-\r\nseek on our side, where political and diplomatic\r\ninterests cloud the search for an equitable solution.\r\nThe aim of my proposal is to move beyond the\r\nsubjective approaches of the two parties by introducing\r\nexternal action, specifically on the part of the\r\ninternational community. Instead of pursuing the\r\ncourse of mutual accusation  which, it may be noted,\r\nleads nowhere because each party is subjective  I\r\nwould simply propose that we eliminate the two\r\nproblems by merging them into a single, unique\r\nproblem. The dispatch of international forces to secure\r\nuncontested borders and the placing on stand-by\r\nstatus of the parts of the territory on which there is no\r\nconsensus would eliminate de facto the two approaches\r\nof occupier occupied and aggressor aggressed. I\r\nbelieve that this approach is all the more feasible and\r\nrealistic in that Israel has declared itself prepared to\r\nreturn all the occupied territories  90 per cent of\r\nthem first and then negotiating a border correction to\r\ncompensate for the other 10 per cent. That would allow\r\nus to abandon the two theories, which can only\r\neternally pit the two parties against each other and\r\ndivide the international community.\r\nThe greatest war of all time, that of 1939-1945,\r\npitted French against German. Today, they no longer\r\nagonize over the question of who was the aggressor\r\nand who the aggressed, or of who was the occupier and\r\nwho the occupied. All such issues have today been\r\nconfined to history. All the parties have decided to join\r\nefforts in a cooperative project: the European Union. I\r\nwould ask, therefore: Can we not dream of a post-war\r\nperiod in which Israel and Palestine can embark on real\r\ncooperation to the benefit of their two peoples?\r\nAs Members know, the Fifth Ministerial\r\nConference of the World Trade Organization ended in\r\nacknowledged failure just a few days ago in Cancún.\r\nBeyond that specific event, we need to reflect more in\r\ndepth on the international trading system. There is\r\nsomething paradoxical in this system based on a liberal\r\nphilosophy, but in which the rich countries spend over\r\n$1 billion a day in various subsidies for their own\r\nagricultural sectors. This ruinous practice leads to the\r\nfreefall of the prices of our peasants agricultural\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\ncommodities and threatens millions of jobs and the\r\nlives of over 2 billion human beings.\r\nThe hypothetical mechanism of limiting the\r\nperverse effects of subsidies can in no way be a\r\ncredible solution to the enormous damage done to the\r\ndeveloping countries. I believe that the time has come\r\nradically to rethink the mechanisms of international\r\ntrade in order to break away from this implacable logic\r\nof injustice and inequity. In that context, I have taken\r\nthe initiative of proposing to convene, every two years\r\nin Senegal, an agricultural Davos  an agricultural\r\nDakar, rather  to encourage thinking on a credible\r\nalternative to the current system.\r\nIt is indeed in no ones interest for the present\r\nimbalances to persist, because they promote poverty,\r\nfavour unemployment and destitution, and fuel the\r\nfeelings of exclusion and despair that lead to\r\nextremism of all types. Once again, for us it is a\r\nquestion of calling not for assistance, but for\r\nthe implementation of a minimum level of fairness in\r\ntrade  free trade, but fair trade.\r\nThe challenges of globalization and\r\ninterdependence that it entails forces us to devise new\r\napproaches that go beyond the obsolete assistance\r\npolicies to create the conditions for a new kind of\r\npartnership, which alone is capable of breaking the\r\nvicious cycle of poverty. Senegal reiterates its\r\ncommitment to implementing the 2001-2010 Brussels\r\nProgramme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries and renews its support for the Office of the\r\nHigh Representative for the Least Developed\r\nCountries, whose activities deserve to be strengthened\r\nby the donor community in the framework of a trust\r\nfund established for that purpose.\r\nThe vision put forward by the New Partnership\r\nfor Africas Development (NEPAD) is also relevant to\r\nthe new kind of partnership just mentioned. For two\r\nyears now, our continent has been carrying out a quiet\r\nrevolution to firmly take its destiny in its own hands\r\nagainst the background of key factors such as peace,\r\nstability, good governance in the public and private\r\nsectors and regional cooperation. Specific plans have\r\nbeen developed and are available to all our partners.\r\nWe have been learning as we go along, by\r\ncreating a gas pipeline in West Africa, for example,\r\nwhich will supply along 600 kilometres 3,640,000\r\ncubic metres of gas starting from Nigeria to Benin,\r\nGhana and Togo. The electricity grids in southern\r\nAfrican that brings together the national electricity\r\ncompanies of 12 countries of the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) is another example\r\nof Africas will to pool our resources. Today NEPAD\r\nhas designated 14,000 kilometres of roads and just as\r\nmany kilometres of railways to be laid, and this is one\r\nof our top priorities. In the area of new information and\r\ncommunications technology, fibre optics now link\r\nEurope and the United States to Dakar, Pretoria and\r\nKuala Lumpur, with connections extending inside the\r\ncontinent. Those specific examples fully show our\r\ndetermination to make NEPAD a reality rather than a\r\ngood intention or unrealistic plan.\r\nOn a continent where everything still needs to be\r\nbuilt, it is not a matter of the need to identify\r\nopportunities but rather to seize them. On the whole,\r\nwe are committed to creating an environment in which\r\nthere will be a clear interest in investment and secure\r\nbusiness operations. On a different order, the African\r\nPeer Review Mechanism has been launched, and\r\ncolleagues before me have already spoken about it.\r\nTogether with our partners, we are ready to fulfil\r\nthe goals of NEPAD. In a few days, some African\r\nheads of State will be in Tokyo to establish cooperative\r\nties between Japan and Africa through the Tokyo\r\nInternational Conference on African Development.\r\nIn a report on the state of the international\r\ncommunity, the Secretary-General made an analysis\r\nthat sounded alarm bells: the world does not seem to be\r\nsharing much anymore. The collective security\r\nmachinery established by the Charter is already\r\nthreatened. The United Nations system inherited from\r\nthe Second World War no longer sufficiently meets the\r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. He therefore\r\ncalls for the implementation of reform, as spelled out\r\nin the Millennium Declaration.\r\nLet us explore together the guidelines that were\r\nestablished by the Secretary-General. Let us make way\r\nfor a culture of peace and dialogue among civilizations,\r\nwhich bears the fertile seeds for consensus,\r\nunderstanding and peaceful coexistence. Let us resist\r\nthe temptation of isolationism and rule of force, for as\r\nJean-Jacques Rousseau rightly said in The Social\r\nContract: The strongest is never strong enough to be\r\nalways the master, unless he transforms strength into\r\nlaw, and obedience into duty. Let us ensure that,\r\nhowever diverse we may be, the universal values of\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\npeace, freedom, democracy and respect for human\r\nrights will always be safeguarded.\r\nI take this occasion to voice my support for the\r\nposition expressed by President Bush against the\r\nheinous sex trade and other forms of slavery. Instead of\r\nvague, futile statements of intention, let us all agree to\r\na realistic platform and guarantee that specific\r\nmeasures are taken. In that regard, we can justly raise\r\nquestions on the follow-up to commitments undertaken\r\nat the Monterrey International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development.\r\nConcerning all these issues vital to humanitys\r\nsurvival, the United Nations must, in accordance with\r\nthe Charter, ensure that its mission remain clearly in\r\nsight, a mission that is a focal point at which our\r\nefforts towards humanitys common goals are\r\nharmonized.\r\nI strongly believe that this need corresponds to\r\nthe legitimate aspirations of all the peoples whom we\r\nrepresent here.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Senegal for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdoulaye Wade, President of the Republic of\r\nSenegal, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Major-General Joseph Kabila, President\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear\r\nan address by the President of the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo.\r\nMajor-General Joseph Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted\r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Major-General Joseph Kabila,\r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila (spoke in French): Allow me,\r\nSir, to discharge the agreeable duty of congratulating\r\nMr. Julian Hunte on his unanimous election to the\r\nPresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nregular session. I would also like to commend your\r\npredecessor, His Excellence Mr. Jan Kavan, who\r\nfulfilled his mandate to the satisfaction of all.\r\nI note the efforts and specific involvement of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in the peaceful\r\nresolution of the complex crisis in the Great Lakes\r\nregion and Central Africa. The Congolese people\r\ncontinue to be grateful to the United Nations system\r\nfor the assistance that it gave it through the United\r\nNation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and the Interim Emergency Multinational Force\r\ndeployed in Bunia and especially for strengthening the\r\npeacekeeping mandate of the United Nations\r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo (MONUC).\r\nThe Congolese delegation associates itself with\r\nthe spirit of sympathy and solidarity elicited by the\r\nterrorist attack committed in Iraq against the great\r\nfamily of the United Nations. Indeed, the Congolese\r\npeople were also deeply moved to learn of the brutal\r\nand tragic death of the ardent defender of freedom and\r\nhuman rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello, to whom I pay\r\ntribute.\r\nAt a time when the entire world remembers the\r\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 in this very city of\r\nNew York, the United Nations was still mourning the\r\nloss of its staff and fell victim yet again to a terrorist\r\nattack in Iraq. The Congolese people renew their\r\nunequivocal condemnation of international terrorism.\r\nAfrica is not spared from the scourge of terrorism. It is\r\nenough to recall the tragic events in Nairobi, Dar es\r\nSalaam and Casablanca.\r\nThis session coincides with the final phase of the\r\nprocess of the establishment of transitional institutions\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is here that\r\nI would like to express my gratitude to the international\r\ncommunity, because its efforts, support and assistance\r\nin this peace process led to the signing and\r\nimplementation of the Comprehensive Agreement.\r\nIt is the hope of the people of the Congo and the\r\nTransitional Government to see the United Nations\r\nredouble its efforts and pursue its support for the\r\nprocess of peace and reunification now underway. At a\r\ntime when this lengthy war is coming to an end, it\r\nshould be noted that the Ituri district is still a gaping\r\nwound that the slightest careless mistake could\r\ninflame. While the deployment of the Interim\r\nEmergency Multinational Force in Bunia allowed for a\r\nsharp reduction in acts of violence and contributed to\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nstabilization of the security and humanitarian situation,\r\nthe situation in the provinces of North and South Kivu\r\nremain of concern.\r\nIt is important that neighbouring countries respect\r\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nso as to recreate a climate conducive to a return to the\r\nnormalization of relations in the region.\r\nAside from the numerous human lives affected by\r\nthis war, the plants and the animals have also endured\r\nimmeasurable damage. Our determination to restore\r\neverything that was destroyed is equalled only by our\r\nhope of turning our country into an oasis of peace for\r\nall. We believe that a United Nations fund to support\r\nthis effort would be fair compensation.\r\nAll the present efforts of the Transition\r\nGovernment for the reunification of the national\r\nterritory, the pacification of the country, the\r\nreconstruction of infrastructure and the restoration of\r\nState authority are working to achieve the ultimate\r\nobjective of transition, namely, the holding of free,\r\ntransparent and democratic elections. It is in that\r\ncontext that my country voices the hope that the\r\ninternational community will provide the necessary\r\nassistance at all stages of the electoral process.\r\nIn the peace process now underway, an area\r\nwhich is of critical importance and an imperative is\r\nthat of independent justice, whose equitable\r\nadministration would mark the end of impunity. On the\r\ndomestic level, the Transition Government is working\r\nto conclude successfully the reform advocated here, for\r\nequitable justice is the real proof of national\r\nreconciliation.\r\nOn the international level we believe that the\r\nmajor objective is the establishment, with the\r\nassistance of the United Nations, of an international\r\ncriminal tribunal for the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo to deal with crimes of genocide, crimes against\r\nhumanity, including rape used as a weapon of war, and\r\nmass violations of human rights. Moreover, to ensure\r\nthe best possible coverage for protection of human\r\nrights, as well as of humanitarian rights, the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo has ratified several\r\ninternational conventions, including the Rome Statute\r\nestablishing the International Criminal Court.\r\nGiven the important provision for the protection\r\nof human rights contained in that Statute, the Congo,\r\non the basis of respect for fundamental principles that\r\ngovern international relations, intends to see that there\r\nis strict respect for the implementation of that\r\ninstrument.\r\nAs one can see, a new era has dawned in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, an era of peace and\r\nreconciliation, of national unity and the re-\r\nestablishment of State authority, an era of\r\nreconstruction, economic recovery and development to\r\nconsolidate and put to use the gains of arduous political\r\nnegotiations.\r\nAware of challenges and looking toward the post-\r\nconflict period, the Transition Government has placed\r\nthe well-being of the Congolese people at the centre of\r\nits concerns. It intends to imprint on its programme the\r\nrequisite good governance, as well as macroeconomic\r\nmanagement that ensures the security of investments,\r\nrespects social rights and guarantees protection and\r\nlegal and judicial security for employment, business\r\nand foreign investment.\r\nWe remain aware of the importance of sharing\r\nthose resources likely to contribute to economic\r\nintegration, and we intend to conduct a policy of\r\ndialogue, openness and good-neighbourliness. The\r\npriority given to regional integration is a sign of our\r\nadherence to the initiative of the international\r\nconference on peace, security, democracy and\r\ndevelopment in the region of the Great Lakes and of\r\nCentral Africa. The Congolese people consider the\r\nholding of this forum a historic opportunity that must\r\nbe seized so that it can lead to the application of\r\nfundamental principles of international law.\r\nAs we are determined to maintain good\r\nneighbourly relations and relations of mutual respect\r\nwith border countries, and thus refuse to serve as a\r\nrear-guard base for subversive movements against the\r\ncountries surrounding us, we in turn will reject\r\ninterference or destabilization from neighbouring\r\ncountries.\r\nFor us there is a need to do everything possible in\r\norder to build peace in the region and to effectively\r\naffirm: a spirit of solidarity, of sharing and of peaceful\r\ncoexistence at the regional and global level; the fight\r\nagainst poverty and the HIV/AIDS pandemic; control\r\nof the movement and proliferation of small arms and\r\nlight weapons, which are claiming victims every day;\r\nand the campaign against the proliferation of\r\nantipersonnel mines.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nThroughout my statement I have condemned\r\nterrorism in all forms. I also spoke of the consequences\r\nof the bloody, unjust and unacceptable war which has\r\njust devastated the fundamental infrastructure of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. I have also referred\r\nto the significant progress made in the peace process\r\nunderway while emphasizing the importance of the\r\nsupport of the international community for the success\r\nof that process, which will culminate in the\r\norganization of elections.\r\nWe are aware and convinced that it is within our\r\npower to play a stabilizing role in Central and Southern\r\nAfrica upon which the stability and economic recovery\r\nof the region depend.\r\nI conclude by reaffirming the will of the people\r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo to cooperate\r\nwith the international community in building a better\r\nworld that is designed to build peace and greater\r\nsolidarity among peoples and nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he\r\nhas just made.\r\nMajor-General Joseph Kabila, President of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear\r\nan address by the President of the Republic of\r\nEquatorial Guinea.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President\r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was\r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema\r\nMbasogo, President of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in\r\nSpanish): The delegation of the Republic of Equatorial\r\nGuinea joins preceding delegations in congratulating\r\nthe President on his election to preside over the work\r\nof the fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly of\r\nthe United Nations. We know that it is a very difficult\r\ntask, Sir, because it is your task to organize the debates\r\nof this the greatest deliberative organ of the United\r\nNations at a time when the Organization  and the\r\ninternational community  are experiencing a crisis\r\nunprecedented in its history.\r\nHowever, Sir, we have confidence in your\r\npolitical and diplomatic ability and in the maturity and\r\nprudence of your country in dealing with international\r\nproblems; thus we are optimistic that our deliberations\r\nwill meet with the greatest success.\r\nWe also congratulate Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan on his tireless efforts to ensure that the United\r\nNations fulfils its mission of peace in the various\r\narmed conflicts, its humanitarian action in response to\r\nthe disasters affecting many countries and its efforts to\r\npromote peace negotiations and multiple forms of\r\ncooperation in order to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment in the world.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea expresses\r\nbefore the Assembly its serious concern at the current\r\ninternational situation, which is manifestly affecting\r\ninternational peace and security, which the United\r\nNations was created to safeguard. Indeed, since the end\r\nof the cold war, which gave rise to hope for a more\r\nunited, cooperative, integrated and peaceful world of\r\ngreater solidarity, it has seemed that the principle rules\r\ngoverning international relations have been steadily\r\nlosing force, with the risk that each State will act\r\naccording to its own will.\r\nThe concepts of democracy, human rights and\r\ntechnical cooperation and assistance are being misused\r\nto the detriment of some, and are being exploited to the\r\nbenefit of others. The concept of democracy, which is\r\nunderstood as governing according to the will of each\r\npeople, has today been transformed into a demand\r\nimposed by certain States in violation of the universal\r\nprinciple that every State is free to adopt the political\r\nsystem that best suits it. Furthermore, the principles of\r\nState sovereignty and non-interference in the internal\r\naffairs of other States, enshrined in international law,\r\nhave been violated in recent years under the pretext of\r\nthe need for humanitarian intervention, which are often\r\nconducted without United Nations approval.\r\nThe efforts to establish a new international\r\neconomic order that ensures cooperation for global\r\ndevelopment have ended in the division of the world\r\ninto North and South, and political conditions are now\r\nbeing imposed on the cooperative assistance that is\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\noffered. Efforts towards the globalization of economic\r\npolicies have not recognized the weak position of\r\nunderdeveloped countries, which suffer grave\r\ndisadvantages in participating and competing in the so-\r\ncalled globalization of the world. We believe that the\r\npolicy of globalization needs to include a special\r\nprogramme for the sustainable development of\r\ndeveloping countries in order to help them attain the\r\nlevel of maturity necessary to benefit from such an\r\nintegration. In all these efforts to achieve international\r\ncooperation for global development, there are good\r\nintentions, but the decisive will needed to build a fairer\r\nand more equitable world has been lacking.\r\nMeanwhile, the situation of the weakest countries\r\ndeteriorates, the economic crisis worsens, political\r\nupheaval spreads and Governments are taking a harsher\r\nstance to protect their power.\r\nInternal warfare, mercenaries and terrorism are\r\ntaking root because, as occurred in the Middle Ages,\r\nthe people cannot bear hunger and poverty and are\r\ndriven to civil disobedience. At the same time, the\r\nUnited Nations is losing its authority because its\r\ndecision-making organs are not democratic, and its\r\ncapacity for humanitarian assistance falls short because\r\nof the proliferation of disasters caused by wars and acts\r\nof terrorism.\r\nIn our opinion, and most regrettably, humanity is\r\nalready dehumanized and the United Nations has lost\r\nits authority. We must now shoulder the responsibility\r\nof rebuilding our policies and of morally rebuilding the\r\nOrganization and restoring its authority. It is the only\r\nworld body capable of representing humanity with\r\nauthority and the only one in which we can achieve\r\nuniversal consensus.\r\nIt is here that we can fight terrorism and\r\norganized crime, because everything is listened to and\r\neverything is discussed in this forum. The use of\r\nweapons against terrorism could turn us into terrorists\r\nourselves. Thus my delegation naturally and\r\nenergetically condemns the terrorist attack against the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad, which caused\r\nthe death of the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\r\nthose of some 30 staff working in the service of peace.\r\nWe express our deep condolences at the loss of those\r\nnoble workers in the service of humanity. We therefore\r\nbelieve that now is the time to adopt strategies so that\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions will not be\r\nconfused with any interests other than the peaceful\r\nsettlement of hostilities.\r\nAs for my country, Equatorial Guinea is faithful\r\nto its commitments as a full-fledged Member of the\r\nUnited Nations and a member of the African Union,\r\ncommitted to the maintenance of peaceful relations of\r\nfriendship and cooperation with other countries. We\r\nrespect the sovereignty, national unity, territorial\r\nintegrity and inalienable rights of other States within\r\ntheir borders, and we favour the promotion of the\r\nsocio-political development of nations.\r\nIn that connection, Equatorial Guinea is a party to\r\nall international conventions that protect the political,\r\neconomic and sociocultural rights of peoples.\r\nDemocracy, as the consensus of the people, is a reality\r\nin which our country is immersed, with the coexistence\r\nof the 13 political parties that constitute it, observing\r\nthe commitments of the binding national political pact\r\nbetween the Government and the opposition.\r\nUndoubtedly, today the formation of a broad-based\r\nGovernment is the greatest exponent of peace and\r\npolitical stability that my country has ever known.\r\nIn order to ensure such internal political\r\nconsensus and cooperation with other countries and\r\ninternational organizations, we believe that\r\ntransparency is absolutely necessary, because it\r\nbenefits all parties. Equatorial Guinea offers open and\r\nunrestricted cooperation to everyone, on the basis of\r\ntransparent action, for everyones mutual benefit.\r\nNevertheless, we are aware that our possibilities are\r\nvery limited as far as acquiring modern technology and\r\nlaying the foundations for sustained and sustainable\r\nand development are concerned. Therefore, we request\r\ninternational cooperation in that regard from friendly\r\ncountries and from international assistance\r\norganizations.\r\nI conclude by expressing the hope that the United\r\nNations will recover its leadership in promoting the\r\npeace and development of our world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Equatorial Guinea for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President\r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was\r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Pakalitha Bethuel\r\nMosisili, Prime Minister and Minister for Defence\r\nand Public Service of the Kingdom of Lesotho\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nDefence and Public Service of the Kingdom of\r\nLesotho.\r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Defence and Public Service of\r\nthe Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Right Honourable\r\nPakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Defence and Public Service of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho and invite him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): My delegation associates\r\nitself with the compliments expressed to Mr. Julian\r\nHunte on his election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at this session; to his predecessor, Mr. Jan\r\nKavan of the Czech Republic; and to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan.\r\nAs we converge upon this city of New York, we\r\nare once again reminded of the stark reality of the\r\nscourge of terrorism, whose effects have reverberated\r\nacross the world. Earlier this month two years ago, in\r\nthis very city, humanity suffered the worst threat ever\r\nvisited on it by terrorism. We continue to share the\r\ngrief of those who will forever miss the love and the\r\nsupport of their loved ones. We must therefore reaffirm\r\nour resolve to join together in partnership to eliminate\r\nthose elements which threaten to destroy humanity and\r\nits way of life.\r\nOur best hope for success is  and should be \r\nour collective strength. We owe it to ourselves and to\r\nfuture generations of humankind to pool our resources\r\nand strategies to annihilate the scourge of terrorism. In\r\ndoing so, we must simultaneously and genuinely\r\nexamine and begin to understand what forces and\r\nfactors drive an inherently good human being to\r\ncommit such desperate actions and drastic acts of\r\nviolence, in the process committing them not only\r\nagainst others, but against himself. Our preventive\r\nmeasures must address such forces and factors in order\r\nto disarm potential terrorists.\r\nThe progress report on the implementation of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals in Lesotho documents\r\nthat the single greatest obstacle to the development of\r\nour nation  and indeed to reaching the objectives laid\r\nout in the Goals  is the scourge of HIV/AIDS. In our\r\npart of the world, Southern Africa, Governments are\r\noverwhelmed by high levels of morbidity and\r\nmortality, especially among the working-age group in\r\nall sectors, including health and agriculture. HIV/AIDS\r\nhas become the leading cause of the food insecurity\r\nand famine that plague so many of our people today.\r\nWe are also frustrated because our efforts to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goal of\r\neducation for all by 2015 through the introduction of\r\nfree primary education is faltering due to the high rate\r\nof absenteeism by both teachers and pupils. Teachers\r\nare sick and dying. Children  especially girls  are\r\ndropping out of school to take care of their sick\r\nrelatives. The number of malnourished, traumatized,\r\norphaned and out-of-school children is increasing at an\r\nalarming rate. We therefore stress the need for urgent\r\nassistance to Lesotho and the southern African region\r\nand increased supplies of the anti-retroviral and other\r\nrelated HIV and AIDS drugs, in order to curb the\r\nscourge. Lesotho and the region also need financial and\r\ntechnical resources for training and capacity-building\r\nin HIV and AIDS programme implementation and\r\nmanagement.\r\nLesotho is concerned that the goal of poverty\r\neradication, which is the first Millennium Development\r\nGoal and one of the cross-cutting themes of all major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, could elude\r\nthe international community. Indeed, this critical state\r\nof affairs is highlighted in the Economic Report on\r\nAfrica, 2003, which indicates that in 2002, of the 53\r\ncountries in Africa, only five achieved the 7 per cent\r\ngrowth rate required to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, while 43 countries registered\r\ngrowth rates below 7 per cent and five countries\r\nregistered negative growth rates.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of a democratizing\r\ncontinent  a precondition set for assistance by the\r\ndeveloped North  there is a growing consensus that\r\nthe decline in official development assistance and other\r\nfinancial flows to Africa is increasing the\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nmarginalization of the continent in the global economy.\r\nWithout new inflows of external resources, the pace of\r\ndevelopment in Africa will forever remain elusive. My\r\ndelegation therefore wishes to reiterate its appeal to the\r\ndeveloped countries to fulfil the commitments made at\r\nall the major United Nations conferences, as well as at\r\nthe Millennium Summit.\r\nFurthermore, we wish to stress the need for a\r\nreview of the list of heavily indebted poor countries\r\nand those on the borderline, so that all poor countries\r\nthat, like Lesotho, face debt servicing difficulties, can\r\nbe considered under the enhanced Heavily Indebted\r\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative. My delegation also\r\nshares the view that debt cancellation for the least\r\ndeveloped countries should be considered as a viable\r\noption so that such countries can inject that money into\r\ntheir economies.\r\nMy delegation reiterates the call for increased\r\nsupport to the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). We are aware that Iraq today\r\ndominates the world spotlight, as was confirmed in\r\nrecent testimony before the Congress of the United\r\nStates of America, which was asked to approve $87\r\nbillion for the rehabilitation of that country. In sharp\r\ncontrast, an injection of only about $6 billion into\r\nNEPAD would go a long way towards achieving what\r\nis a continentwide agenda.\r\nAfrican leaders need extensive support as they\r\naddress, inter alia, the root causes of the agricultural\r\ncrises in the continent. For us in Africa, agriculture is\r\nthe engine of overall growth, as it is at the very core of\r\npeoples livelihoods, especially in the rural areas. It is\r\nlinked to issues of food security and affects growth in\r\nother economic sectors.\r\nLesotho is deeply concerned that armed conflicts\r\ncontinue to hinder economic growth in Africa and\r\nelsewhere. We have also been shocked by several\r\nreports of an extreme lack of respect for the basic\r\nprinciples of international humanitarian law on the part\r\nof parties to armed conflict. Equally regrettable are\r\nincidents of egregious violations of the rights of\r\nwomen and children. We therefore commend the\r\nUnited Nations for all its efforts aimed at the\r\nelimination of human suffering in armed conflict.\r\nIndeed, the establishment of the International Criminal\r\nTribunals, the birth of the International Criminal Court\r\nand the setting up of the Special Court for Sierra\r\nLeone, are cause for considerable optimism and prove\r\nbeyond any doubt that the world has grown weary of\r\nimpunity. It is our fervent hope that Member States will\r\ncontinue to provide the necessary support and\r\ncooperation to those institutions.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nAfrica hungers for peace. The continent must\r\nnever again have to witness acts of violence and\r\natrocities such as those that were recently committed in\r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Liberia. We\r\nhope that the international community will continue to\r\nsupport all endeavours aimed at attaining lasting peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in those countries.\r\nMy delegation is encouraged by the progress to\r\ndate to restore law and order in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, including the establishment of\r\nan all-inclusive transitional Government of National\r\nUnity. The international community must intensify its\r\nefforts to assist millions of Congolese people who are\r\nnot only displaced but also facing serious food\r\nshortages. My delegation is confident that, with the\r\nnecessary support, the Government of National Unity\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo will restore\r\npeace and security in the country and heal the deep\r\nwounds caused by war and ethnic hatred. We are also\r\ngratified that the Security Council has mandated a\r\nspecial Panel to investigate the plunder of natural\r\nresources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It\r\nis our hope and wish that those responsible will be\r\nbrought to book.\r\nThe people of Angola have peace at last, now that\r\none of Africas longest-running fratricidal wars has\r\ncome to an end. The scars of war in Angola will remain\r\nforever, deeply embedded in the memories of the most\r\nvulnerable of the population  the women and\r\nchildren of that country, where motherhood was abused\r\nand children were deprived of their childhood.\r\nReintegration and rehabilitation assistance to Angola,\r\ntherefore, should, in the main, target those groups.\r\nThe future of Somalia continues to hang in the\r\nbalance, despite the efforts by Kenya, the Inter-\r\nGovernmental Authority on Development, the African\r\nUnion and all other stakeholders to put an end to the\r\ncarnage in that country. Somalia has been turned into a\r\nbreeding ground for warlords who have no respect for\r\nhuman life but are greedy for power and money. We\r\ntend to agree with those who argue that the deployment\r\nof an international force would help to facilitate the\r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nAt the end of the day, however, the responsibility for\r\nbringing peace and reconciliation to Somalia lies with\r\nthe Somalis themselves.\r\nAlthough there have been positive indicators in\r\nthe search for a peaceful and acceptable solution to the\r\nconflict between Israel and Palestine, we are concerned\r\nthat the recent resumption of the cycle of violence will\r\nrender the road map for peace futile. The drastic and\r\nrepressive measures, the unilateral erection of a wall\r\ndividing the two, the reoccupation of Palestinian towns\r\nand villages, and the targeting of Hamas leaders with\r\nthe aim of killing them are all measures which cannot\r\nhelp the course of peace or ensure that the Palestinian\r\npeople enjoy their inalienable rights, including the\r\nright to self-determination in a sovereign and\r\nindependent State. In like manner, the continuing\r\nsuicide missions by militant groups to kill Israelis\r\nindiscriminately cannot, and must not, be condoned or\r\njustified.\r\nBut then two stark realities must be addressed:\r\nfirst, that the root cause of the problem is the illegal\r\noccupation of Palestinian lands; and secondly, that no\r\none country can be an honest broker in the Middle\r\nEast. History itself positions some countries so much\r\nwith one party to the conflict that they cannot  even\r\nwith the best of intentions  be non-partisan.\r\nConsequently, my delegation strongly urges the United\r\nNations to take the initiative and to lead the process,\r\nand thus to lend legitimacy and credibility to the efforts\r\nto find an abiding solution.\r\nThe same goes for the people of Western Sahara.\r\nIn the civilized world of the twenty-first century, it is\r\nsimply untenable that we still have colonizers in some\r\nparts of the world, in disregard of the widely accepted\r\nprinciples of self-determination and democracy. The\r\ninternational community must intervene so as to bring\r\nfinality to the status of the Saharawi Arab Democratic\r\nRepublic. The brotherly people of Sahara have suffered\r\nunduly and long enough.\r\nOn a positive note, we welcome the lifting of\r\nsanctions against Libya by the Security Council.\r\nNevertheless, it is our contention that the lifting of the\r\nsanctions would have been more significant if all the\r\nmembers of the Security Council had raised their flags\r\nin favour.\r\nBy the same token, it is now time to collectively\r\naddress all issues relating to the unilateral economic\r\nblockade against Cuba. It is simply untenable for the\r\nUnited Nations to look on helplessly when a Member\r\nState strangles another Member State of this body,\r\nsimply because it holds or practices different economic\r\nphilosophies or political viewpoints. Those truths must\r\nbe confronted and discussed in honesty and without\r\nmalice towards anyone. Otherwise, our credibility and\r\nour raison dêtre are called into question.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to refer to the question of\r\nthe reform of the Security Council. It is now a trite fact\r\nthat the credibility of the United Nations  including\r\nits adherence to multilateralism  is being openly\r\nquestioned. It will take a lot of work to change that\r\nperception on the part of many, especially in the\r\ndeveloping world. The Secretary-General, Mr. Annan,\r\nhas on several occasions stressed the need for radical\r\nreform to restore United Nations credibility. We\r\ntherefore applaud the statement that he made before\r\nthis body yesterday that he intends to establish a high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent persons to look into the\r\nchallenges to peace, security and other global issues. It\r\nis our hope that the recommendations of that panel will\r\npave the way to a better international order.\r\nIt has been almost 10 years since the\r\nestablishment of an open-ended working group to study\r\nall questions relating to equitable representation in the\r\nSecurity Council, including increasing the membership\r\nof the Council. My delegation is of the view that there\r\nis an urgent need to accelerate the pace and to redouble\r\nour efforts to bring this matter to a conclusion. Let us\r\nface it: the very concept and practice of a veto in the\r\nSecurity Council is simply untenable and is totally at\r\nvariance with the democratic principles of our modern\r\ntimes. For one member with a veto to overrule 14\r\nothers is simply undemocratic. It is patently unjust and\r\ncontrary to every principle underpinning fair play and\r\nworld order. My delegation cannot  in all honesty\r\nand without malice to anyone  understand how and\r\nwhy leading champions of democracy can cling so\r\ndesperately to such an outmoded, primitive and unjust\r\nsystem. The same sacred convictions, truths and beliefs\r\nthat guided and forced our forbears to abolish slavery,\r\nto declare racism and genocide crimes against\r\nhumanity and to preach and uphold the equality of all\r\nhumans must of necessity guide us in this instance.\r\nOtherwise, history will judge and chastise us\r\nseverely  but justifiably  as dishonest. Such is the\r\nnaked truth staring us in the face.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nMinister for Defence and Public Service of the\r\nKingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Defence and Public Service of\r\nthe Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Saufatu Sopoanga,\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs,\r\nImmigration and Labor of Tuvalu\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Immigration and Labor of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Saufatu Sopoanga, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Immigration and\r\nLabor of Tuvalu, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Saufatu\r\nSopoanga, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, Immigration and Labor of Tuvalu, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Sopoanga (Tuvalu): The people of Tuvalu,\r\non whose behalf I have the honour to speak, wish me\r\nfirst of all to convey their warmest greetings to the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We\r\nexpress congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your\r\nelection. Coming from a small island country as well,\r\nwe hold your election in high regard and wish you\r\nsuccess in your presidency. We also commend the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his excellent\r\nleadership in the General Assembly this past year.\r\nA year ago, we reflected on the events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001. On the eve of this session, we were\r\nhorrified yet again by the brutal terrorist attacks on the\r\nUnited Nations in Iraq, which killed some of the\r\nOrganizations finest, including its Special Envoy, Mr.\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello. Tuvalu strongly condemns\r\nthose acts and has joined in the great number of\r\ncondolences to the Secretary-General, to his staff and\r\nto the families of the victims.\r\nThe recent wave of terror attacks and the havoc\r\nthey have created worldwide have instilled a sense of\r\nfear and uncertainty. They have not only proved the\r\nexistence of forces bent on destroying the very\r\nfoundation of the United Nations, they have also\r\nunderscored the urgency with which we must\r\ncollectively combat those forces. As a small island\r\ndeveloping country, Tuvalus greatest fear is that, in the\r\nwake of such events, developed countries will lack the\r\nresolve to address as well the developmental and\r\nenvironmental issues that are so fundamental to lasting\r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn Tuvalu, and the Pacific in general, our\r\nisolation, fragmentation and lack of infrastructure and\r\nmanpower leave us vulnerable to terrorism. This\r\nthreatens our security, especially the security of our\r\ntraditional and cultural practices upon which our very\r\nexistence depends. Likewise, this also threatens the\r\nsecurity of the world. We are therefore grateful for the\r\nanti-terrorism efforts of the United Nations in\r\ncooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum and through\r\ndirect contact with national authorities.\r\nFor our part, I am pleased to say that Tuvalu is\r\ncommitted to acceding to the United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\r\nits three protocols, as well as United Nations\r\nconventions against terrorism, including the\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel. In this spirit, we are also\r\ncommitted to regional security arrangements, as set out\r\nby the Pacific Islands Forum.\r\nBut to fulfil our international obligations on anti-\r\nterrorism, we need technical and financial assistance.\r\nMore importantly, capacity-building through\r\nappropriate education and human development, for\r\nwhich we seek the support of the international\r\ncommunity, is vitally important to strengthen our\r\nresilience in the face of such vulnerabilities.\r\nConflict prevention is vital to national, regional\r\nand world peace. Tuvalu shares the view that conflicts\r\nare best resolved through dialogue and mutual\r\nunderstanding of the root causes. The United Nations\r\nmust continue to address the underlying causes of\r\nconflicts and be the common forum where nations\r\nresolve their differences. Attempts to resolve conflicts\r\nby unilateral means outside the United Nations\r\ninevitably result in ongoing mistrust and instability.\r\nThe stakes are too high to allow this to happen. We\r\nmust continue to engage in constructive dialogue.\r\nLet me briefly speak on a related matter. Each\r\nyear, highly radioactive and toxic material passes\r\nthrough the Pacific by ship on its way to and from\r\nnorth Asia and Europe. It is known that some of the\r\nmaterials are weapons-grade. We are concerned about\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nthese shipments because of the massive threat they\r\npose to the Pacific Ocean  a vital source of our\r\nlivelihoods and economic development. We would like\r\nthese shipments to cease for the sake of the inhabitants\r\nof the islands and stability of the broader Pacific basin.\r\nWe believe the United Nations has a very\r\nimportant peacekeeping role to play, and are therefore\r\ngrateful for the progress made by the United Nations in\r\nrestoring peace in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will continue its\r\nsupport there, to ensure meaningful opportunities and\r\npeace for the people of Bougainville.\r\nTuvalu noted, however, the manner in which the\r\nUnited Nations has handled the conflict in the Solomon\r\nIslands. As a small island and a least developed\r\ncountry, similarly susceptible to instability, we strongly\r\nfeel that the United Nations must better respond to\r\nMember States concerns, irrespective of political\r\naffiliations. The United Nations is a body for all\r\nnations, and all nations should be afforded the\r\nassistance required of it.\r\nIn the same spirit, Tuvalu places significant\r\nimportance on the need to treat everybody equally, as\r\nenshrined in the Charter. Accordingly, Tuvalu believes\r\nthat to deny representation at the United Nations to the\r\n23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan,\r\nwho are active and responsible participants in world\r\naffairs, especially in trade, commerce and international\r\ndevelopment, is unjust and morally wrong. Their\r\nsignificant contributions to technology and their own\r\nneed for access to international support to combat the\r\nchallenges of terrorism and health epidemics such as\r\nHIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome\r\n(SARS) cannot be continually ignored.\r\nIn our view the United Nations, which prides\r\nitself on the protection of fundamental human rights,\r\nincluding the right to self-determination, and which\r\nupholds the dignity and worth of the human being,\r\ncannot continue to turn a blind eye to ignore the\r\nobvious realities of the situation. Just as the people of\r\nTaiwan have so responsibly contributed to international\r\ndevelopment, they also need the support of the\r\ninternational community. Their continuing isolation\r\ncould potentially give rise to serious conflicts.\r\nTuvalu would therefore like to call on this august\r\nbody to seriously and urgently consider the issue of\r\nmembership of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\r\nUnited Nations and its agencies.\r\nOn 1 October, Tuvalu will mark the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of its independence. On reflection, we are\r\ngrateful for the support of the international community,\r\nparticularly from Tuvalus traditional development and\r\nregional partners over the past quarter century. Guided\r\nby the principles of good governance, respect for the\r\nrule of law and human rights, democracy and self-\r\ndetermination, to which we are deeply committed, and\r\nwith the help of such support, Tuvalu has been able to\r\nprosper and enjoy a peaceful and equal coexistence\r\nwith the rest of the world. Our future survival as a\r\nnation is founded on these basic United Nations values.\r\nDespite relative stability, we live in constant fear\r\nof the adverse impact of climate change. For a coral-\r\natoll nation, sea level rise and more severe weather\r\nevents loom as a growing threat to our entire\r\npopulation. The threat is real and serious, and we liken\r\nit to a slow and insidious form of terrorism against us.\r\nIn this respect, Tuvalu is actively participating in\r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\r\nChange and the Kyoto Protocol, and we are extremely\r\ngrateful to all the nations that have joined us in\r\nresolving this threat. Nevertheless, we are deeply\r\ndismayed that key industrialized nations do not share\r\nour concern. Climate change affects all nations.\r\nThis is not just a problem for small island States\r\nlike our own. We believe that all nations must take\r\npositive steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nBut we also believe that the industrialized world must\r\nact first. It is the emissions from the past that are\r\ncreating the problems of today. Steps must be taken to\r\naccount for and redress the emissions of the past. We\r\nimplore all nations to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, as this\r\nis the only appropriate process that will bring about\r\neffective collective action to resolve this growing\r\nthreat.\r\nAs Tuvalu moves into the twenty-first century, we\r\nare also challenged by the many changes that are taking\r\nplace in the world, especially those brought about by\r\nglobalization. Never before have we faced such\r\ncomplex challenges. Yet, for Tuvalu and others like us,\r\nwhile we witness every day the forces of trade,\r\ncommunications and travel creating a single global\r\ncommunity, the problems of poverty, marginalization\r\nand environmental decline continue to plague many\r\nparts of the world.\r\nThe recent breakdown in discussions on\r\ninternational trade in Cancún, Mexico, clearly shows\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nthat we live in a very complex world. If nothing else,\r\nthe Cancún meeting was a significant step forward for\r\nthe voice of the developing world. No longer are the\r\ndeveloping nations willing to accept the rhetoric of\r\nthose who want to impose a trade regime that tends to\r\nfavour the wealthy and marginalize the poor.\r\nTuvalu and many island States are in a\r\nparticularly weak position to take advantage of the\r\nopportunities presented by globalization. There is a\r\ngenuine need to better recognize the special case of\r\nsmall island developing States and of their need to\r\nparticipate in a more equitable globalized world.\r\nSustainable development, particularly for the\r\nmost disadvantaged and vulnerable States, especially\r\nfor small island least developed countries is crucial. Of\r\ncourse, we recognize that the primary responsibility for\r\nsustainable development rests with each country, on its\r\nown terms. However, as a poorly resourced small\r\nisland least developed countries, even the best efforts\r\nto escape the cycle of poverty and marginalization are\r\ndoomed without the support of the international\r\ncommunity, civil society and the private sector.\r\nTuvalu and those like us are encouraged by the\r\ncommitment of the international community to\r\naddressing poverty and development challenges, as\r\ncontained in the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nMillennium Declaration and other various United\r\nNations development frameworks. But these will\r\nremain mere rhetoric unless they translate into real\r\ndevelopment that can make a difference on the ground.\r\nIn that regard, proper and effective\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nfor the Sustainable Development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States is crucial for the development of\r\ncountries like Tuvalu. To that end, conducting a full\r\nand comprehensive review of the implementation of\r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action in the lead up to\r\nthe International Meeting in Mauritius next year is\r\nimperative. We kindly request the United Nations\r\nSecretariat to undertake this analysis as a matter of\r\nhigh priority so that we can learn from the past and\r\nmove forward in a more positive way.\r\nThat said, however, the overall decline in official\r\ndevelopment assistance in real terms is cause for\r\nserious concern. Despite pledges at the Monterrey\r\nConference, major industrialized nations are not\r\nfulfilling the minimum target of 0.7 per cent of their\r\ngross national product. For small island States, that\r\nreluctance translates into lower economic growth, as\r\nwell as into widening the gap between the least\r\ndeveloped countries and the industrialized nations.\r\nTuvalu therefore appeals to the donor countries to\r\nmake serious efforts to meet the United Nations\r\nminimum official development assistance target to\r\nenable the least developed countries to attain a better\r\nquality of life for all their peoples.\r\nIn conclusion, for atoll island States like Tuvalu,\r\nefforts aimed at sustainable development, peace and\r\nsecurity will be meaningless unless the issue of climate\r\nchange is addressed with urgency. As has been warned\r\nby the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change in\r\nits Third Assessment Report, the threat of global\r\nwarming and rising sea levels is serious business.\r\nAddressing these threats requires a global effort by\r\nboth industrialized and developing countries, consistent\r\nwith the objectives of, and the commitments made in,\r\nthe Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nAgain, Tuvalus interest in enforcing the Kyoto\r\nProtocol is not self-serving. The consequences of not\r\nurgently enforcing Kyoto will be felt everywhere\r\naround the world. Tuvalu appeals to the countries that\r\ncan make the difference to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as\r\na matter of urgency. As we in Tuvalu celebrate our\r\nSilver Jubilee anniversary, and as we look forward into\r\nthe future, it is our hope that out of this great Hall there\r\nwill emerge better understanding and good will, to\r\nfurther solidify the foundation upon which the long-\r\nlasting security and survival of Tuvalu and many others\r\nis built and for peace in the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Immigration and Labor of\r\nTuvalu for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Saufatu Sopoanga, Prime Minister and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Immigration and\r\nLabor of Tuvalu, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable Sir Anerood\r\nJugnauth, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear a\r\nstatement by Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir\r\nAnerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nMauritius, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth (Mauritius): Let me first\r\nextend to you, Sir, on behalf of my delegation and in\r\nmy own name, our sincere congratulations on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this\r\nsession. Indeed, it is a matter of pride for all small\r\nisland States, and Mauritius in particular, to see you\r\npresiding over the Assembly. My delegation wishes to\r\nassure you of its full support and cooperation during\r\nyour tenure of office.\r\nLet me also express my Governments deepest\r\nappreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr.\r\nJan Kavan of the Czech Republic, for the remarkable\r\nmanner in which he presided over the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and to the\r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for\r\nhis dedicated leadership of our Organization. I wish to\r\nassure him of our full support in his appeal for radical\r\nreforms of our Organization and the setting up of a\r\nhigh-level panel to address the issues of peace and\r\nsecurity, and institutional reform.\r\nSince we were here last autumn, many events of\r\nglobal importance have occurred. The war against Iraq\r\nwas waged and hostilities were declared at an end, but\r\npeace and stability in Iraq have yet to be restored.\r\nTerrorism has continued relentlessly on its path of\r\nghastly attacks and indiscriminate killing of innocent\r\ncivilians. The geographical shift, however, in the\r\nterrorist attacks is becoming increasingly a disturbing\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMultilateralism, which was almost condemned to\r\na premature burial, is being re-energized.\r\nUnfortunately, the recurring problems of HIV/AIDS,\r\nmalaria, poverty, lack of development, conflicts and the\r\nready supply of small arms and light weapons have\r\ncontinued to inflict death and suffering on an\r\nunprecedented scale, particularly in Africa.\r\nThe attack against the United Nations compound\r\nin Baghdad contains countless messages. The most\r\nsignificant of them is that our Organization is in urgent\r\nneed of major overhaul and reform, as rightly stated by\r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nThe premature deaths of the Special Envoy of the\r\nSecretary-General to Iraq, the late Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello, and other dedicated staff members of the United\r\nNations, whom we deeply mourn, should make us\r\nreflect on the dangers behind foreign policy initiatives\r\nthat undermine or ignore the United Nations.\r\nThe international community is deeply attached\r\nto the legitimacy the United Nations confers on its\r\nactions. It is our collective duty to refrain from taking\r\nany measures likely to weaken it.\r\nThese horrendous terrorist acts have\r\ndemonstrated anew the crucial need for the\r\ninternational community to tackle the root causes of\r\nterrorism.\r\nAs all small islands, we in Mauritius remain\r\nhighly vulnerable in respect of our security and\r\nterrorist threats. With limited means at our disposal,\r\ncoupled with the multiple demands on our scanty\r\nresources, we find that it is only through international\r\nefforts and cooperation that we can win the war against\r\nterrorism. We are particularly anxious that there should\r\nbe concerted and sustained action and a commitment to\r\ncooperation at the international level with a view to\r\neradicating the scourge of terrorism. All countries must\r\ncooperate to stem the flow of cross-border infiltration.\r\nThe financing of terrorism and the proceeds of\r\ntransnational organized crime need to be closely\r\nmonitored.\r\nNot winning the war against terrorism as well as\r\nthat against transnational organized crime is not an\r\noption for the world today. Mauritius views with\r\nconcern that, despite the stated commitment of the\r\ninternational community to the cause of disarmament,\r\nthe actions of many countries do not match their\r\nrhetoric.\r\nThe new challenges to security and disarmament\r\nshould compel us to look anew at the potential threat\r\nposed by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and to pursue more vigorously efforts\r\ntowards their total elimination.\r\nWe reiterate our appeal to the nuclear Powers for\r\nthe early convening of a conference on nuclear\r\ndisarmament as a first step towards complete\r\ndisarmament, keeping in mind that such a regime must\r\nbe comprehensive and non-discriminatory.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nOver the last year the international communitys\r\nability to tackle political conflicts and find lasting\r\nsolutions has been dismal.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to\r\npreoccupy us. Despite the various initiatives, including\r\nthe latest Road Map, violence remains unabated and we\r\nfear that recent developments in the region will unleash\r\nfurther killings and destruction.\r\nNo solution will be possible there unless all the\r\nprotagonists are taken on board. Exclusion as a policy\r\nis destined to fail. We continue to believe that President\r\nArafat is an essential part of the solution, and any\r\nattempt to sideline him will be detrimental to any peace\r\ninitiative.\r\nWe call on both Israel and the Palestinian\r\nAuthority to exercise utmost restraint and to pursue\r\ntheir efforts for the implementation of the Road Map\r\nwith a view to putting an end to the occupation and the\r\nsucceeding generations of Palestinians in refugee\r\ncamps. The establishment of a Palestinian State at the\r\nearliest should be the priority of the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe situation in Iraq is disquieting. It is important\r\nthat the Iraqis regain as soon as possible total\r\nsovereignty and assume control over their own destiny\r\nthrough a democratic process. The United Nations has,\r\nin the view of my delegation, a leading role to play in\r\nthis process and must be empowered to do so.\r\nThe African continent has been plagued for too\r\nlong by conflicts and wars, which have led to the loss\r\nof thousands of innocent lives and the squandering of\r\nenormous wealth and resources. Small arms and light\r\nweapons have in fact become the weapons of mass\r\ndestruction on the African continent. These weapons\r\ndrain African resources and we appeal to those\r\ncountries that manufacture and market those weapons\r\nof destruction to ensure that Africa does not continue\r\nto be their killing field.\r\nNonetheless, during the past two years, the\r\nAfrican continent has demonstrated an unprecedented\r\nmomentum in its efforts to seriously address these\r\nconflicts and to search for lasting solutions. There is,\r\nhowever, some good news out of Africa and everything\r\nis not gloomy.\r\nThe transformation of the Organization of African\r\nUnity into the African Union, the coming into\r\noperation of the various commissions of the Union and\r\nthe election of commissioners on a gender-equal basis\r\nat the Maputo Summit in July last are clear indications\r\nthat Africa has chosen a new path and is confident that\r\nit will be able to meet the challenges ahead.\r\nIt is a matter of great satisfaction that peace is\r\nnow slowly returning to the troubled areas on the\r\ncontinent. The conflicts in Sierra Leone and Angola\r\nhave ended. A government of national unity is in office\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Efforts under\r\nthe auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) for a comprehensive and lasting\r\nresolution to the conflict in Somalia have been\r\ncrowned with success. We do recognize that years of\r\nconflict will not be easily forgotten, but what is\r\nreassuring is that African leaders are maintaining a\r\nhands-on approach to these situations.\r\nThe recent developments in Liberia and the\r\nrestoration of the constitutional order in Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe confirm the ability of African leaders to\r\neffectively address issues affecting their continent.\r\nThere is fresh confidence in the African leaders\r\nability to deal with flashpoints. The implementation of\r\nthe Peace and Security Council of the African Union\r\nwill go a long way towards preventive action being\r\ntaken. We recognize that we will have to bear primary\r\nresponsibility for the peace and security of our\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n(NEPAD) is our basic instrument of empowerment.\r\nHaving decided to take our destiny in our own hands,\r\nwe are not going to engage in the blame game, but we\r\nwill take action to reverse poverty and to promote good\r\ngovernance. We will do whatever is necessary to attract\r\ninvestment. The establishment of the African Peer\r\nReview Mechanism within NEPAD will ensure that\r\neconomic development takes place in the spirit of good\r\ngovernance, democracy, transparency and\r\naccountability.\r\nIt is comforting, therefore, that this homegrown\r\nAfrican initiative has received global recognition. The\r\nassistance of the Group of Eight and countries like\r\nIndia in the implementation of the objectives of\r\nNEPAD is much appreciated.\r\nWe noted with regret that the rate of official\r\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries is\r\ndecreasing, contrary to the commitment made in\r\nMonterrey.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nWe therefore call on the developed countries and\r\nother key specialized institutions in the monetary,\r\nfinancial and development fields to deliver on their\r\nimplementation plans for the Monterrey Consensus\r\nduring the October high-level dialogue.\r\nMondays high-level segment on HIV/AIDS, in\r\nwhich more than a hundred delegations took part,\r\ndemonstrates the extent of the concern of the United\r\nNations membership to the pandemic of HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe welcome the initiative of the General Assembly to\r\nmaintain global awareness of the problem and to ensure\r\nthat effective action is taken urgently to stop the spread\r\nof the pandemic.\r\nI mentioned earlier the need for reform of our\r\nOrganization. It is imperative that the necessary\r\nreforms of the United Nations be undertaken to reflect\r\nin a more realistic manner the political realities in the\r\nworld today.\r\nThe United Nations Charter must be amended to\r\nprovide for a Security Council that is more democratic\r\nand more representative of todays world. Should\r\npermanent membership of the Security Council with\r\nveto power be retained, we consider that India should\r\nbe admitted with such a membership at the earliest.\r\nLikewise we believe that the African continent should\r\nbe adequately represented at the same level.\r\nWe would also urge a review of the veto power,\r\nwhich has been used in the past and continues to be\r\nused for purposes outside the letter and spirit of the\r\nCharter.\r\nMay I welcome the decision of the Security\r\nCouncil to lift the sanctions on the Libyan Arab\r\nJamahiriya.\r\nThe situation of small island developing States\r\n(SIDS) will be the focus of attention in September\r\n2004, when Mauritius hosts an international meeting\r\nfor the 10-year review of the Barbados Programme of\r\nAction. This Barbados +10 meeting will allow us to\r\nmake a full assessment of the Programme of Action\r\nand evaluate its success and shortcomings.\r\nWe need to constantly remind the international\r\ncommunity about the fragility and vulnerability of\r\nSIDS where ecology and geography combine to inflict\r\nirreparable damage.\r\nMauritius and all other small island developing\r\nStates attach great importance to this international\r\nmeeting and hope that it will harness more efforts on\r\nthe part of the international community to provide the\r\nrequired assistance to the small island developing\r\nStates. I call on this Assembly to lend the necessary\r\nsupport to make this international meeting a success.\r\nIn this regard, let me express my appreciation to\r\nthe Commonwealth and La Francophonie for their\r\nactive interest in supporting the cause of small island\r\nStates.\r\nAs the current Chairman of the Alliance of Small\r\nIsland States (AOSIS), may I inform the Assembly that\r\nthe 44 Alliance Member States and Observers consider\r\nthe International Meeting to be a very important\r\noccasion for reaffirming the partnership for sustainable\r\ndevelopment that grew out of the Rio Conference. In\r\nMauritius next year we expect to establish an\r\nappropriate framework for partnership and cooperation.\r\nThe time has come to enshrine the special case of\r\nSmall Island Developing States as an important\r\ncomponent of focus and attention on the part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe appeal to the international community to\r\nsupport this process and ensure the full and effective\r\nparticipation of all SIDS at the meeting and to ensure,\r\nas well, its own participation in it.\r\nAccess to information and communication\r\ntechnologies remains a fundamental concern in Africa.\r\nWhile such technologies are often promoted as an\r\ninstrument that will allow countries to leapfrog stages\r\nin development, there is a real fear that the digital\r\ndivide could very well prove to be yet another handicap\r\nthat adds to Africa\u0027s marginalization.\r\nWe therefore urge that particular attention be paid\r\nto issues of access and infrastructure. My delegation\r\nwishes to underscore that Mauritius, like many other\r\nsmall island States, has high hopes that the Plan of\r\nAction of the World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety will provide concrete action in favour of small\r\nisland developing States, whose geographical isolation,\r\nremoteness and other inherent constraints warrant\r\nspecial attention.\r\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) Ministerial Conference at Cancún has dealt a\r\nblow to the multilateral trading system. That is very\r\nunfortunate, as there are no winners but only losers.\r\nFor small developing countries in particular, a strong\r\nrules-based global trading system provides protection\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nagainst the unilateralism of powerful trading countries\r\nor blocs. The serious imbalances in the WTO system,\r\ncoupled with the lack of effective and operational rules\r\nand disciplines to address their development concerns,\r\nresulted the failure of Cancún. We should pick up the\r\npieces from Cancún and try to construct a trading\r\nsystem that guarantees equity and fairness for\r\ndeveloping countries. Only such an approach will\r\nprovide the legitimacy that the WTO system so badly\r\nneeds to deliver on the Doha Development Agenda.\r\nIn order to successfully respond to the\r\nmultifaceted challenges we are facing in the world\r\ntoday, we are convinced that the international\r\ncommunity should rededicate itself to the values of\r\nsolidarity, tolerance, mutual respect and cooperation.\r\nThe belief that countries can be immune from\r\nwhat other countries do is no longer tenable. The need\r\nfor international cooperation, rather than confrontation,\r\nis critical. A new international order is essential if we\r\nare to avoid a collision of cultures and religious beliefs.\r\nThis is the last occasion on which I will address\r\nthe General Assembly in my capacity as Prime\r\nMinister. In six days time, I will relinquish my current\r\npost and accede to the presidency, while my Deputy\r\nPrime Minister will be sworn in as Prime Minister. I\r\nam confident that he will be accorded the same\r\ncollaboration and friendship that I have enjoyed during\r\nmy tenure in office.\r\nBefore I conclude, however, I renew my appeal to\r\nthe United Kingdom to take all measures to complete\r\nthe process of the decolonization of Mauritius. For\r\nyears, Mauritius has consistently reaffirmed its\r\nsovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, including\r\nDiego Garcia, here and in all international forums. I\r\nsincerely regret that this issue has not been resolved. I\r\ntherefore reiterate our appeal to the United Kingdom,\r\nas a country known for its fair play and for\r\nchampioning human rights, and to our friends in the\r\nUnited States, to engage in a serious dialogue with\r\nMauritius over the issue of the Chagos Archipelago so\r\nthat an early solution may be found.\r\nThe removal of the Chagossians under false\r\npretences resulted in gross violations of human rights.\r\nHopefully this aspect of the matter will be resolved\r\nthrough the British courts shortly.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI also appeal to the French Republic, with which\r\nwe have excellent relations, to resume the dialogue\r\nwith a view to returning Tromelin island to Mauritian\r\nsovereignty.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWith those words, I bid the Assembly goodbye.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Mauritius, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Azerbaijan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nMr. Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ilham Heydar oglu\r\nAliyev, Prime Minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): First of all, I would like\r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession and to express gratitude to Mr. Jan Kavan for\r\nhis work as the President during the fifty-seventh\r\nsession.\r\nThis year has been hard for the United Nations.\r\nThe events surrounding Iraq have revealed weak links\r\nin the system of international security. Not for the first\r\ntime, the Security Council, owing to disagreements\r\namong its members, was unable to ensure the\r\nimplementation of its resolutions and to react\r\nadequately to the situation.\r\nThose disagreements continue to have a critical\r\ninfluence on the activity of the Security Council with\r\nregard to both Iraq and other crises and conflicts. It is\r\nclear that existing United Nations mechanisms do not\r\nmeet the requirements of our time, and it is necessary\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nto reform the United Nations, including the Security\r\nCouncil, which reflects the reality of half a century\r\nago.\r\nAzerbaijan supports the well-known reform\r\nproposals of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in\r\nparticular with regard to the expansion of the\r\nmembership of the Security Council, and counts on the\r\ngoodwill of the permanent members of the Council\r\nwith regard to the revision of its mechanisms, in\r\nparticular the right of veto.\r\nWe hope that the international community will\r\nnow be able to consolidate its efforts to restore and\r\nstrengthen a united and indivisible Iraq and to establish\r\ndemocracy based on the free will of all of the Iraqi\r\npeople. Our country, which is ready to take part in this\r\nprocess, has begun to contribute to the strengthening of\r\nsecurity and stability in Iraq.\r\nThe terrorist act against the United Nations\r\nHeadquarters in Baghdad shocked the entire\r\ninternational community. The death of Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello and his colleagues was a tragic loss for the\r\nOrganization and all of us. What happened in Baghdad\r\nonce again showed how vulnerable we are in the face\r\nof terror and convinced us that terrorists are capable of\r\ncommitting any crime. The only response should be an\r\nuncompromising commitment to fight against anyone\r\nwho resorts to terrorism, no matter what goals are used\r\nas a cover. Selectivity and double standards have no\r\nplace in this respect.\r\nOur country, which has fallen victim to the\r\naggression, occupation and terror unleashed by\r\nArmenia, has for years been fighting terrorism on its\r\nown. Our appeals to the international community to\r\nunite its efforts in combating terrorism went unheeded.\r\nThe alarm went off only after 11 September 2001.\r\nSuccess in the fight against terrorism cannot be\r\nachieved without eradicating the underlying roots and\r\neliminating the factors that create a favourable\r\nenvironment for its dissemination. On the other hand, it\r\nis not possible to resolve conflicts throughout the\r\nworld, including in the southern Caucasus, under\r\nconditions of continuing terrorism or of support for it\r\nat the State level.\r\nWe have to keep in mind that terrorist groups,\r\ncreated and developed by separatist and extremist\r\nforces, are usually based in illegally controlled\r\nterritories, in the so-called grey zones that emerge as a\r\nresult of acts of armed separatism and external\r\naggression. One such uncontrolled grey zone is\r\nNagorny Karabakh and other regions of the Republic of\r\nAzerbaijan, occupied by Armenian military forces.\r\nWhile carrying out the comprehensive struggle\r\nagainst terror and resolving conflicts on the basis of\r\nprinciples and norms of international law, the\r\ninternational community should decisively resort to\r\nforce. That is the only effective way of restoring justice\r\nand ensuring the rule of law.\r\nThe delegation of Azerbaijan has repeatedly\r\ndrawn the attention of the international community\r\nfrom this high rostrum to the ongoing conflict between\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan. Ten years have elapsed since\r\nthe Security Council adopted four resolutions\r\ndemanding the immediate, complete and unconditional\r\nwithdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces from the\r\nAzerbaijani territories. However, Armenia continues to\r\nchallenge the international community by ignoring\r\nthose decisions, whereas the Security Council and the\r\nMinsk Group of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) do not undertake any\r\nadequate measures in that regard.\r\nAzerbaijan has on many occasions declared its\r\ncommitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict\r\non the basis of norms and principles of international\r\nlaw. We are determined to continue with our efforts in\r\nthis direction, and we count on the active participation\r\nof the international community. Azerbaijan will never\r\naccept a settlement on the basis of the so-called\r\nexisting realities and will not cede a single inch of its\r\nland. Azerbaijans patience is not limitless, and no one\r\nshould try to take advantage of it. Responsibility for\r\nthe deadlock in the settlement lies with the aggressor\r\nArmenia, and not with the victim of aggression,\r\nAzerbaijan. The passive position of an observer taken\r\nby the international community can only aggravate that\r\ndeadlock.\r\nOnly after Armenia evacuates all the Azerbaijani\r\nterritories and thus creates a basis for the peaceful\r\nsettlement of the conflict can Armenia count on normal\r\ninter-State relations and cooperation with Azerbaijan.\r\nBy rejecting our constructive proposals, based on the\r\nobservance of international law, Armenia is\r\ndemonstrating its genuine intention to seize and annex\r\nAzerbaijani territories.\r\nArmenias authorities continue to profess the\r\nideology of aggressive nationalism, militarism,\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nseparatism and terrorism and to doom their people to\r\nthe deepest crisis. In a society where territorial\r\nexpansion and the search for external enemies are\r\ninstilled as a national idea, democracy and pluralism\r\ncannot take root. It should be realized in Armenia that\r\nthe present situation of its conflict with Azerbaijan will\r\nnot only fail to resolve but will also certainly aggravate\r\nits own serious internal social and economic problems.\r\nIt is with a sense of regret that one has to\r\nacknowledge that inaction by the international\r\ncommunity leads to the strengthened self-confidence of\r\nArmenia in pursuing its destructive policy. Both the\r\nOSCE Minsk Group and the Security Council have\r\nbacked off in the face of illegitimate force, thus calling\r\ninto question the seriousness of their intentions and\r\ncontinuity of their actions.\r\nAppeasement of the aggressor seriously\r\nundermines the whole system of international security,\r\nwhich is based on the inviolability of principles and\r\nnorms of international law. That attitude has on many\r\noccasions taken a heavy toll on the international\r\ncommunity.\r\nWe appeal to the Security Council to carry out the\r\nnecessary measures in order to ensure the\r\nimplementation of the above-mentioned four\r\nresolutions, and we expect that decisive steps will be\r\ntaken to stop criminal and aggressive actions in the\r\noccupied territories and on the line of engagement, as\r\nwell as to push the occupying forces to unconditionally,\r\nimmediately and completely evacuate the seized\r\nAzerbaijani territories.\r\nThe conflict has deprived almost one million\r\nAzerbaijanis of roofs over their heads. It is clear that\r\nthe forthcoming winter will again become another hard\r\ntest for the refugees and the internally displaced\r\npersons, hundreds of thousand of whom continue to\r\nlive in tent camps. The Government of Azerbaijan,\r\nusing its limited resources, spares no effort to mitigate\r\ntheir suffering. Recently, the President of the Republic\r\nof Azerbaijan by decree allocated more than $70\r\nmillion to the construction of housing for refugees.\r\nWhile we highly appreciate the assistance of the\r\ninternational community, we nevertheless are worried\r\nby its decreasing scale. We urge the relevant United\r\nNations agencies and donor countries, as well as non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, to boost their attention to\r\nthe problems of the forcefully displaced Azerbaijani\r\npopulation and to respond adequately to their needs. As\r\nfor the long-term resolution of this problem, it lies, of\r\ncourse, in the settlement of the conflict between\r\nArmenia and Azerbaijan and in the return of the\r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons to their\r\nhomes.\r\nThe conflict has also severely damaged the\r\neconomy of Azerbaijan. However, having mobilized\r\nour domestic resources, we managed to overcome\r\nserious social-economic crises and to move towards\r\nstabilization and development. Economic reform\r\npolicies and the oil strategy elaborated and being\r\nimplemented under the leadership of the President of\r\nAzerbaijan, His Excellency Mr. Heydar Aliyev, have\r\nalready yielded concrete results. These reforms have\r\nled to macroeconomic stability and high economic\r\ngrowth rates.\r\nThe promotion of the market economy and\r\nentrepreneurship increased the share of the private\r\nsector of the economy to 73 per cent. Figures on\r\nforeign direct investment per capita show that\r\nAzerbaijan is one of the leaders among the countries\r\nwith economies in transition. On average, the annual\r\neconomic growth rate is between 8 per cent and 10 per\r\ncent.\r\nThe implementation of large-scale transregional\r\nprojects on development and transportation of\r\nhydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Sea to the world\r\nmarket and the diversification of transport corridors,\r\ninitiated by Azerbaijan, have opened new prospects for\r\nthe social and economic development of countries\r\nalong the East-West corridor, aimed at the restoration\r\nof the historic Silk Road.\r\nThis progress would be impossible without\r\ninternal political stability, which has created the\r\nprerequisites and conditions for implementing radical\r\npolitical reforms and the development of democratic\r\nsociety. Today, Azerbaijani democracy stands at the\r\nedge of its next test of maturity and firmness. On\r\nOctober 15, the elections for President of the Republic\r\nwill be held in Azerbaijan. The legislative basis for\r\nconducting genuinely free and fair elections has been\r\nestablished in the country. The recently adopted\r\nElection Code was widely discussed at the local and\r\ninternational levels, and it meets the highest\r\ninternational standards. Numerous international\r\nobservers of the OSCE, the Council of Europe and\r\nother international organizations, as well as local\r\nobservers, will follow the presidential elections.\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nThe triumph of democracy, social progress and\r\nsustainable development on a global scale are\r\nimpossible unless the problems of poverty and sharp\r\ndisproportion in economic performance across different\r\ncountries and regions are resolved. In that regard, the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals\r\nis extremely important. Combating poverty\r\npresupposes close interaction between developed and\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nRegrettably, there is still no breakthrough in that\r\nregard. Developed States should pay more attention to\r\nthe problems of the countries with economies in\r\ntransition. Experience proves that narrow-minded\r\ninterests frequently prevail, and thus deadlocks emerge\r\nin the negotiation process. Azerbaijan believes that\r\nenlargement of parties to the multilateral trade system,\r\nas well as granting the provisions of special and\r\ndifferential treatment in the World Trade Organization\r\n(WTO) to both developing countries and countries with\r\neconomies in transition, will contribute to the\r\nsuccessful global integration of the latter.\r\nWe are firmly convinced of the need to develop a\r\ndialogue among civilizations and cultures. Only\r\nthrough dialogue and good will shall we defeat mistrust\r\nand confrontation, and unify our forces in addressing\r\ncommon threats and challenges.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me once again to reiterate\r\nAzerbaijans strong adherence to its political course,\r\naimed at building a strong democratic State with a\r\nmarket economy, and our genuine willingness and\r\ndesire to effectively contribute to peace and\r\ninternational security.\r\nMr. Quiñones Abarca (Honduras), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ilham Heydar oglu Aliyev, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Linnette Saborío, Vice-President of\r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nAssembly will now hear an address by Her Excellency\r\nMs. Linnette Saborío, Vice-President of the Republic\r\nof Costa Rica.\r\nMs. Saborío, Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nCosta Rica, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have\r\nthe great pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms.\r\nLinnette Saborío, Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nCosta Rica, and inviting her to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMs. Saborío (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate His Excellency\r\nMr. Julian Hunte on his well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly. We are convinced\r\nthat his well-known personal and professional qualities\r\nwill allow him to lead our work to full success.\r\nWe particularly welcome the fact that a fraternal\r\nCaribbean country should hold so high a position. We\r\ntrust that your election will shed light on the role of the\r\nsmaller nations in this Organization and will allow us\r\nto consider the challenges that small economies face.\r\nToday, once again, the international community is\r\ngathered at the United Nations to consider the most\r\nserious problems afflicting mankind and to design\r\nspecific measures to resolve them. In so doing, we\r\nmust recall the essential purpose of this session \r\nattaining peace, justice and well-being for each and\r\nvery individual on this planet. Indeed, the human right\r\nto peace informs, nourishes and justifies all other basic\r\nrights and constitutes the very essence of the purposes\r\nand principles of the United Nations.\r\nBasic individual freedoms, political, social and\r\neconomic rights and commitments to sustainable\r\ndevelopment and disarmament all have a single\r\npurpose  securing peace, freedom and happiness for\r\nall. The first step towards peace therefore is full respect\r\nfor human rights.\r\nFundamental human rights constitute a minimal\r\nframework of guarantees necessary to ensure the\r\nintegral development of the human person and the\r\nconstruction of a harmonious society. For that reason,\r\nrespect for human rights at all levels of society and for\r\nall peoples, without distinction, is indispensable.\r\nCosta Rica advocates for the strengthening of the\r\ninternational mechanisms for the promotion and\r\nmonitoring of human rights. We must overcome the\r\npoliticization of verification machinery by creating\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nobjective criteria for the implementation of human\r\nrights instruments in such a way that verification itself\r\nencourages policies that promote human rights and that\r\nconsolidate their protection.\r\nSimilarly, it is necessary to achieve the\r\nuniversality of international treaties that promote\r\nrespect for basic rights. In that context, we welcome\r\nthe fact that, in conjunction with the current general\r\ndebate, a special treaty event to promote the signature\r\nand the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the\r\nConvention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman\r\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment is being held.\r\nThat instrument constitutes an effective mechanism for\r\npreventing those very serious violations of human\r\ndignity.\r\nWe welcome the creation and the establishment of\r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague,\r\nthanks to the successful election of its Judges last\r\nFebruary. Fortunately, mankind now possesses an\r\neffective, independent and impartial institution with the\r\nauthority to prosecute the most serious crimes that\r\ninfringe upon human dignity.\r\nWe also deem it urgent to consider the\r\nrelationship between human rights and the\r\nenvironment. We welcome the fact that the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation recognized the\r\nimportance of studying, in an exhaustive and\r\ntransparent way, that relationship between human\r\nrights and the environment, including the fundamental\r\nright to development. We consider it indispensable that\r\nthis item be added to the agenda of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nFull observance of human rights is being\r\nthreatened by some recent developments in the area of\r\nbiotechnology. Unquestionably, progress in the areas of\r\nmedical science and genetic research facilitate the\r\ndevelopment and the discovery of new therapies and\r\nmedical techniques. However, those same technologies\r\npose new ethical challenges, because they can be used\r\nto violate human rights and assault the intrinsic dignity\r\nof the human person.\r\nThe use of human embryos in scientific\r\nexperiments, discarding them in the process, is\r\nunacceptable. Cloning reduces the individual to a mere\r\nobject of industrial production and manipulation. That\r\nis objectionable both morally and legally. Costa Rica\r\nsupports the prohibition of all forms of human cloning\r\nand has proposed a draft resolution to this end, which\r\ntoday has dozens of countries sponsoring it.\r\nThe second step in the path to peace is to make\r\ndemocracy a form of life. True democracy is a\r\npermanent process that demands daily efforts of\r\ncoordination and cooperation in order to respect the\r\nwill of the majority and the rights of the minorities.\r\nTrue democracy also entails equal opportunities in the\r\nareas of social and economic development.\r\nA third step to peace is disarmament,\r\ndemilitarization and the reduction of military\r\nexpenditures. The reduction of military arsenals\r\ndecreases opportunities for violence and makes it\r\npossible to devote greater resources to social\r\ndevelopment programmes. In that context, we welcome\r\nthe progress made by the Central American nations\r\nregarding the reduction of their armed forces and\r\nmilitary arsenals. Two States from the region have\r\nalready abolished their armies  Panama in 1990 and\r\nCosta Rica since 1948. We support the proposal of\r\nPresident Bolaños of Nicaragua, on the reasonable\r\nbalance of forces in the Central American region,\r\nwhich will generate greater transparency and\r\nconfidence.\r\nMy Government supports the adoption of a\r\ncomplete ban on arms transfers to all terrorist groups,\r\nas well as to those groups and Governments that\r\ncommit gross or systematic violations of human rights\r\nor international humanitarian law. The prompt adoption\r\nof a legally binding convention to regulate the arms\r\ntrade is urgent.\r\nWe urge those States that possess nuclear\r\nweapons to truly commit themselves to the nuclear\r\ndisarmament negotiations. We call upon all States to\r\nrenounce the development of new nuclear weapons and\r\nto ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\r\nWeapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\r\nTreaty.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the member States of\r\nthe Organization of American States have recently\r\nadopted a Costa Rican initiative on the non-\r\nproliferation of chemical weapons in the Western\r\nHemisphere.\r\nThe pursuit of peace requires the peaceful\r\nresolution of conflicts through the mechanisms\r\nestablished pursuant to international law. The\r\nInternational Court of Justice occupies a central\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nposition as the principal judicial organ of the United\r\nNations that ensures the rule of law in international\r\nrelations. We urge all States to accept its obligatory\r\njurisdiction without conditions.\r\nIn order to make further progress towards peace\r\nwe must strengthen United Nations mechanisms\r\ndesigned to prevent armed conflict and humanitarian\r\ncrises from occurring and to re-establish the peace once\r\nsuch conflicts have broken out. The Security Council\r\nmust carry out its duties in a more effective, active and\r\nfair way; no national interest should prevent it from\r\ntaking action. In this context, we must revitalize the\r\nSecurity Council reform process, which, after 10 years\r\nof work, still lacks results.\r\nIn order to attain peace and prevent civil wars, we\r\nmust devote sufficient financial, technical and human\r\nresources to the peacekeeping operations carried out\r\nunder the auspices of this Organization. Such missions\r\nshould enjoy the resolute support and effective\r\nparticipation of all nations, as was reaffirmed in the\r\nRio Group statement on the situation in Colombia,\r\nadopted on 24 May in Cuzco. We urgently appeal for\r\nthis Organization to support the peace process in\r\nColombia and to urge the guerrilla movements to sign\r\nan agreement to cease hostilities and enter into an\r\nopen-ended and transparent dialogue with a view to\r\nreaching a peaceful and definitive resolution of the\r\nColombian conflict.\r\nThe United Nations must decisively address the\r\ndeep-rooted causes of armed conflict. It is necessary to\r\neliminate the sources of tension and violence. It is\r\nessential to eradicate the economic, social and political\r\ninjustices that fuel conflict.\r\nThe change of regime in Iraq, which we welcome,\r\nhas given the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity at large a unique opportunity to fully\r\nintegrate that nation into the international system. We\r\nmust not miss this opportunity. We therefore call upon\r\nthe occupying Powers, the rest of the international\r\ncommunity and the United Nations to work for the\r\nreconstruction and normalization of that nation.\r\nFurthermore, we must not allow Iraq to become a\r\nsource of regional instability or a breeding ground for\r\ninternational terrorism. We must bear in mind the\r\nsacrifice made by Sergio Vieira de Mello and all the\r\nother United Nations personnel who gave their lives in\r\nBaghdad for this Organization and for the people of\r\nIraq. Their sacrifice must guide us in our work. Their\r\nmartyrdom must lead us to devote every effort to the\r\nprotection of the fundamental right to peace.\r\nToday, peace is threatened by the resurgence of\r\ninternational terrorism. All necessary measures must\r\ntherefore be taken, in conformity with the rule of law,\r\nto prevent acts of terrorism and punish those who\r\ncommit them. The fight against international terrorism,\r\nhowever, should not become an excuse to violate\r\nhuman rights or to adopt repressive measures against\r\nan innocent population.\r\nIn 1971, the General Assembly approved the\r\nentry of the Peoples Republic of China into the United\r\nNations. That decision was correct, inasmuch as it\r\npromoted the universal character of this global\r\nOrganization. In accordance with that same principle,\r\nmy country has since that time been advocating that the\r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan also be represented in\r\nthis Organization.\r\nWe believe that the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\ncould greatly contribute to the work of this\r\nOrganization. For many years that nation was an active\r\nMember of the United Nations. It participated\r\nconstructively in all of its activities and the work of its\r\nbodies. Since then, the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nhas been developing close and productive relations\r\nwith peoples and Governments throughout the world,\r\npromoting programmes and projects for the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of communities. In keeping with the\r\nprinciple of universality that the United Nations itself\r\npromotes, Costa Rica advocates that both Governments\r\nbe represented at this Organization.\r\nI have set out a series of steps that are\r\nindispensable if peace is to be fully enjoyed. Such steps\r\nare the very least we need to take in order to fulfil our\r\ncommitment to peace  and that commitment must be\r\nabsolute.\r\nMay God bless us all as we work for the well-\r\nbeing of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nVice-President of the Republic of Costa Rica for the\r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMs. Linnette Saborio, Vice-President of the\r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Per Stig Moeller, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Denmark.\r\nMr. Moeller (Denmark): I should like at the\r\noutset to express, on behalf of Denmark, the most\r\nsincere condolences to the United Nations and to the\r\nfamilies of Sergio Vieira de Mello and of all those who\r\nso tragically lost their lives in Baghdad five weeks ago.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to Swedish Foreign Minister\r\nAnna Lindh. She was taken from us by an evil act that\r\nis beyond comprehension, while carrying out her\r\nimportant work. We will all miss Anna; she should be\r\nhere today.\r\nWe need the United Nations today more than\r\never. We need the United Nations to provide a more\r\nsecure world, to fight international terrorism, to resolve\r\nconflicts and to halt the spread of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We need the United Nations in ensuring\r\nfundamental human rights for all people. We need the\r\nUnited Nations to establish, implement and develop an\r\ninternational legal order based on the rule of law. And\r\nwe need the United Nations in combating poverty and\r\nsecuring sustainable economic growth.\r\nIraq has been a key challenge for the Security\r\nCouncil. A united Council provided the United Nations\r\nwith a mandate to assist the people of Iraq in a wide\r\nrange of areas, including facilitating and supporting the\r\npolitical process. Iraq, the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community as a whole suffered a tragic\r\nloss in the recent attacks. But it should not make us\r\nwaver in our determination to continue working for a\r\nbetter future for Iraq. Those evil attacks must not\r\ninspire other terrorists to threaten the United Nations\r\npresence in Iraq. Sovereignty should be transferred to\r\nthe Iraqis as quickly as possible, but the international\r\nmilitary presence must be maintained until security is\r\nfully restored. The United Nations role and presence in\r\nthis process must be strengthened.\r\nImmense challenges lie ahead of us. Our goal is\r\nto ensure that the twenty-first century becomes the\r\ncentury in which each and every one of us can live in\r\npeace, stability and growing prosperity  a century in\r\nwhich freedom, respect for the individual, human rights\r\nand democracy become daily realities, not just abstract\r\nideas, for billions of people.\r\nConsidered over time, the United Nations has a\r\nstrong scorecard. We have managed to transform the\r\nparalysed cold war Organization into a key forum for\r\ninternational discussions and decisions in all fields. Let\r\nme highlight three areas where the United Nations\r\ncould be even stronger.\r\nFirst, the United Nations is at the forefront of the\r\nfight against poverty. By agreeing to achieve the\r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015, we have set\r\nourselves measurable targets by which we must all\r\nstand and be counted. In Monterrey and Johannesburg\r\nthe developing countries acknowledged responsibility\r\nfor their own development, based on good governance,\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. The African efforts\r\nmust be especially highlighted and supported. Every\r\nindividual on the African continent must feel the\r\nurgency of our collective efforts to improve his or her\r\nliving conditions. Only then can the tide be turned on a\r\ncontinent that has been lagging behind for too long.\r\nDenmarks commitment to development speaks\r\nfor itself, be it in terms of development assistance or in\r\nrelation to trade liberalization. Especially for the\r\nbenefit of the developing countries, we need such trade\r\nliberalization. Therefore, the lack of results in Cancún\r\nwas a great disappointment. We needed results, both\r\nfor the developing world and for the global economy.\r\nWe did not achieve those results in Cancún, but\r\nDenmark will certainly work hard to achieve them in\r\nthe future  not least for the developing world.\r\nDenmark supports a high-level event in 2005\r\nfocusing on the commitments made in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration in order to give new energy to the\r\nimplementation of all the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. Denmark stands ready to provide a full account\r\nof its efforts to achieve the Goals, including in the\r\nfields of trade and development assistance.\r\nSecondly, the United Nations is essential for the\r\nestablishment, the implementation and the development\r\nof an international legal order based on the rule of law.\r\nThe United Nations was created with a strong purpose\r\nand a great vision. The concepts and values of the\r\nCharter  of international peace and stability based on\r\nequality among nations and respect for their\r\nsovereignty  are universal.\r\nThe strength of our values and of our principles\r\nmust be measured by our ability to apply them to the\r\nrealities around us. We must be ready to adapt our\r\ncollective actions to the needs of the world. Attesting\r\nto that is the immense work done in the fields of human\r\nrights; the rights of women and children, including the\r\nright to reproductive health care and services; the\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nstruggle against terrorism; and the efforts to control\r\nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons.\r\nFurthermore, the establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court is the single most important step in the\r\nmodern history of international criminal law. It sends a\r\nstrong signal that the international community will no\r\nlonger allow the most serious international crimes to\r\nremain unpunished.\r\nDenmark firmly believes that a democratic\r\nsociety based on the rule of law is the best guarantee\r\nfor stable development, in terms of both upholding\r\nfundamental freedoms and furthering social justice.\r\nHuman rights are universal and must be applied by all\r\nStates. It is imperative that all States be committed to\r\ncooperating constructively with the United Nations\r\nhuman rights mechanisms and that they overcome\r\ntraditional attitudes concerning State sovereignty.\r\nThirdly, the United Nations is at the core of\r\nefforts to tackle old and new security challenges. The\r\nSecurity Council has successfully taken on\r\ninternational terrorism, and it should continue to focus\r\non how to deal with weapons of mass destruction.\r\nAnother pressing issue is how to prevent the\r\nbreakdown of societies and to address the root causes\r\nof conflicts; and, if prevention is unsuccessful, how to\r\ndeal with the breakdown of social order. A strategic\r\nvision on how to deal with the new challenges is\r\nurgently needed.\r\nThe Security Council still reflects the power\r\nstructures that existed at the end of the Second World\r\nWar. Consequently, a comprehensive reform is needed\r\nto make the Council more representative and, at the\r\nsame time, to safeguard the efficiency of the decision-\r\nmaking process. It is of equal importance that the\r\nSecurity Council ensure compliance with its\r\nresolutions.\r\nThe process towards more targeted and smart\r\nsanctions should be continued. We must ensure that\r\nsanction regimes clearly monitor whether the objects\r\ntargeted are in compliance with the aims pursued by\r\nthe sanctions. Assistance to Member States in\r\nimplementing sanctions should also be considered.\r\nAccompanying resolutions with incentives or carrot-\r\nand-stick measures could be another option.\r\nWe would also welcome a strengthening of the\r\ndivision of labour and cooperation with regional and\r\nsubregional organizations. Over the past 50 years, we\r\nhave been building strong regional institutions to\r\novercome our divisions and to manage our problems.\r\nWith the initiative of the New Partnership for Africas\r\nDevelopment and the rapid intervention of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States in\r\nLiberia, recent developments in Africa are very\r\nencouraging in that regard as well. To further promote\r\nthose developments, we must all continue and expand\r\nour political and financial support for the strong and\r\nprogressive African leadership.\r\nOver the years, Denmark has been active in world\r\naffairs and has been a strong supporter of the United\r\nNations. We shall continue to focus on areas where we\r\ncan contribute to make the world a better place in\r\nwhich to live for all. Denmark is therefore seeking to\r\nbecome a member of the Security Council in 2005 and\r\n2006. If we become a member of the Council, we shall\r\nwork to further develop the Councils efficiency and its\r\nimpact. We shall work for increased synergy among the\r\nmilitary, political, humanitarian and developmental\r\naspects of conflict management. We hope we can make\r\na special contribution to solving the various conflicts\r\nthat are still not settled around the world, and we shall\r\ndo our utmost to prevent new conflicts from arising.\r\nOur aim will be to continue to build bridges between\r\nthe multiple interests of the Members of the United\r\nNations.\r\nUnderpinning our vision of a strong United\r\nNations for the twenty-first century is the need to\r\nstrengthen and reform the Organization at all levels and\r\nin all its aspects. We express strong support for the\r\nSecretary-General and for his persistent efforts in that\r\nregard, and we hope that the Secretary-Generals high-\r\nlevel panel will provide new inspiration and fresh ideas\r\nfor us all. But we, the Member States, must take the\r\nlead; the ball is in our court. We must enable the\r\nUnited Nations to take credible, efficient action to meet\r\nthe challenges of this century and of this millennium;\r\nthat is our collective responsibility and duty.\r\nAs a member of the European Union, Denmark is\r\nworking actively towards these goals, and I can assure\r\nthe Assembly that all the Nordic countries strongly\r\nsupport the Secretary-Generals proposals and are\r\nready to face these challenges. Let us together ensure\r\nthat the United Nations is ready, too.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Jean Obeid, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Emigrants of the Lebanese\r\nRepublic.\r\n35\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nMr. Obeid (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): This\r\ngreat number of heads of State and Government have\r\nassembled at the current session neither to perform\r\nceremonial rituals nor to conduct the periodic\r\nconsideration of agendas. Rather, it is the state of the\r\nworld today that necessitated this exceptional\r\ngathering, because people everywhere sense a growing\r\nstruggle between fear and hope, security and\r\ninstability, force and weakness, surplus and need, and\r\nfreedom and oppression.\r\nReturning to this Assembly is tantamount to\r\nreturning to our origins and sources, and to common\r\nsense and principles, after nearly losing them. We\r\nreturn to this mother Organization like children who\r\nreturn home changed. Some are obedient and others are\r\nrebellious; some are just and others are unjust.\r\nHowever, we find the mother Organization as badly\r\nhurt as some of its children.\r\nWhat hurts the United Nations hurts us all. Its\r\nfallen victims are indeed martyrs of humanity in its\r\nentirety, like Count Folke Bernadotte, Dag\r\nHammarskjöld, Sergio Vieira de Mello and others who\r\nhave made the ultimate sacrifice for this Organization.\r\nThe peoples of the world perceive the United\r\nNations as a haven for the rights of the weak and the\r\nneedy. It also exercises its authority to dissuade the\r\nstrong who act aggressively and forget their obligations\r\nand commitments.\r\nIn our region and in our country, we have greatly\r\nsuffered from double standards and recourse to might\r\nat the expense of right. Since the foundation of an\r\nentity on the ruins of the people of Palestine, an entity\r\nthat recognizes neither its own borders nor those of\r\nothers, repeated injustices and wars have arisen as a\r\nresult of violations of the spirit and raison dêtre of this\r\ninternational Organization.\r\nComprehensive and just approaches were adopted\r\nat the international Conference in Madrid to find a\r\npeaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict,\r\nresulting in principles and accomplishments that cannot\r\nbe renounced or reversed. Incomplete approaches\r\nemerged, but they failed to achieve peace, maintain\r\nsecurity and ensure stability. It has become clear to\r\neveryone, except to those in Israel who are arrogant\r\nand intransigent, that there can be no security without a\r\npolitical solution, and no partial, peaceful, political\r\nsolution without the comprehensive peace that\r\nembodies the spirit of justice of the Madrid Conference\r\nand the integrated Arab peace initiative of the Arab\r\nSummit in Beirut.\r\nSuch a solution is based on the relevant\r\ninternational resolutions calling for the return to\r\nLebanon of the rest of the territory still under Israeli\r\noccupation, including Shebaa farms; for the return to\r\nSyria of its territory up to its 4 June 1967 borders; and\r\nfor enabling Palestinian refugees to exercise their legal,\r\nhumanitarian and moral right of return to their\r\nhomeland. Such a process should ensure the\r\nestablishment of a sovereign, independent, stable and\r\nviable Palestinian State, with al-Quds al-Sharif as its\r\ncapital.\r\nDevelopments on the ground, however, dash that\r\nhope. The Government of Israel continues to build\r\nsettlements, impose extrajudicial sentences, kill men,\r\nwomen and children, demolish houses and carry out\r\npre-emptive arrests and assassinations.\r\nSimilarly, Lebanon suffers from persistent and\r\nextremely provocative and aggravated Israeli threats,\r\nattacks and violations by sea, land and air, as described\r\nby the Secretary-General and his Special\r\nRepresentative in the region. The international\r\ncommunity should therefore pressure Israel to end\r\nthose excesses.\r\nLebanese detainees and prisoners are still\r\nillegally held hostage, without due process, in Israel,\r\nwhich still keeps the remaining maps of the landmines\r\nthat it planted during its occupation of southern\r\nLebanon. Furthermore, Israel continues its policy of\r\nassassination and still covets Lebanons waters and\r\nnatural resources.\r\nI must say that the failure to guarantee the right\r\nof Palestinian refugees to exercise their right of return\r\nputs the entire Middle East in an explosive situation.\r\nThe Government and people of Lebanon are especially\r\ncommitted to the implementation of this right, which\r\nwe consider to be legal, natural and moral. Therefore,\r\nthe so-called realistic solutions to this problem should\r\nnot even be raised, since they run counter to the\r\nprinciples of international law and the spirit of justice.\r\nIndeed, only a commitment to the right of return and\r\nrefusal to resettle the refugees in Lebanon are at the\r\ncore of Lebanons reconciliation that ended the war in\r\nLebanon and that led to the Taif Agreement, which was\r\nendorsed by the United Nations.\r\n36\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nIn this context, I wish to stress that Lebanons\r\npolicy choices and positions regarding the Middle East\r\nconflict are constant and unaffected by the balance of\r\npower. We believe that those choices are righteous,\r\nmoral and consistent with the requirements of a just\r\npeace. Those choices alone are capable of bringing\r\nabout a possible and strong settlement to the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict.\r\nSuch an undertaking is compatible with the goals\r\nof the United Nations, as it strives to strengthen its\r\nrole, with the support of the sponsors of the peace\r\nprocess and the participation of the European Union.\r\nIt is in Israels interest to revert to or to be\r\nbrought back to the language of reason and justice.\r\nSince Israels Governments have failed to do so,\r\nresponsibility for bringing Israel back to reason falls to\r\nthe international community.\r\nFor in Israel there is a Government that considers\r\nonly its rights and fails to take account of its\r\nobligations. We believe that those who consider only\r\none side are the most dangerous kinds of people.\r\nUnder the pretext of security, the Government in\r\nIsrael is continuing to build a wall that separates Israel\r\nfrom the people of Palestine and is attempting to build\r\na higher, larger and more menacing wall between the\r\ngreater nations of the West and the rest of the world,\r\nespecially the Arab and the Muslim world. Israel does\r\nthat in a bid to serve and support those who wish to\r\nfuel conflict between East and West, between\r\nChristianity and Islam and among religions, cultures\r\nand civilizations, when, in the final analysis, there is\r\nonly one human civilization, which stems from\r\ncommon spiritual values based on the belief in one\r\neternal God and his messengers.\r\nFurthermore, the Government of Israel resorts\r\ndaily to the stick as a means of subjugation. It ignores,\r\nor pretends to ignore, that the use of the stick incites\r\ndisobedience; that, with time, the oppressors and the\r\noppressed often exchange roles and positions; and that\r\nmany who were once at the helm at various stages of\r\ntheir lives have faded from historical memory, having\r\nforgotten that only God is everlasting, as are the\r\nuniversal principles of equality, fairness and justice.\r\nThere are those in the Israeli Government who\r\nwere brought to power by the very extremism that\r\ncaused the ouster of their predecessors or even led to\r\ntheir assassination, and who nevertheless do not\r\nhesitate to label Arabs and Muslims as the extremists\r\nor accuse them of being the sole source of extremism.\r\nIn Israel, there are those who insist on making\r\nIsrael a fortress towering over the region, rather than a\r\nState within it. There are those who make life for the\r\nPalestinians worse than death, and who are determined\r\nto force fellow Israelis to die with the Arabs in war,\r\nrather than live with them in peace.\r\nThere are those in the Government of Israel who\r\ntry to deny that Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinians\r\nright of return are a mandatory path for any political\r\nsettlement and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace\r\nis to be achieved. On the contrary, they desperately use\r\nthe feeble-minded to fan the flames of conflict among\r\nthe Palestinians themselves, among the Lebanese,\r\nbetween the Lebanese and the Syrians, and among the\r\nArabs, instead of extinguishing the flames of conflict\r\nbetween the Arabs and Israelis in a decent, just and\r\ncomprehensive manner.\r\nThe Government of Israel believes that it is more\r\nimportant to gain time than to gain peace, that it is\r\nbetter to manipulate the various tracks and problems\r\nthan to seek to resolve the conflict in all its dimensions\r\nand problems and that intimidation can transform\r\ninjustice into right, right into injustice and occupation\r\ninto independence.\r\nIn Israel, the Government clings to its slogan of\r\nabsolute sovereignty, and to the sovereignty it violates\r\nor violates with others, limiting the role of its most\r\nimportant ally to providing money and weapons,\r\ndenying it even the right to advise. If the worlds only\r\nsuper-Power utters a word of advice about the\r\nconstruction of the wall of separation and\r\ndiscrimination, it is ignored and construction of the\r\nwall continues.\r\nOffence is often the result of excessive tolerance\r\nof fault, and excessive chaos in standards and\r\nyardsticks is caused by the discriminatory use of\r\nstandards regarding justice and international\r\nresolutions. It is not just, wise, safe or peaceful for\r\npowerful States to continue to tolerate double and\r\nmultiple standards when dealing with Israel, while\r\napplying firm standards and measures when dealing\r\nwith the weak and the oppressed and other nations of\r\nthe world.\r\nThis clearly leads us to call for the reform of the\r\nUnited Nations, as well as for strengthening its role, by\r\n37\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nreviewing the working methods of the Security\r\nCouncil, expanding its membership, giving it more\r\nweight in decision-making and respecting the\r\ndemocratic consultative nature that must be the basis of\r\nour international Organization. That reform should\r\nfairly and effectively address new challenges of world\r\nsecurity and safety. It should also provide balance and\r\nstability in international relations, particularly if that is\r\naccompanied by modernizing the work of the United\r\nNations organs and rationalization to avoid use of the\r\nright of veto in a way that contravenes law and justice\r\nin the world.\r\nIn Iraq, there is also a growing call for the United\r\nNations to play a pivotal role in assisting the people of\r\nIraq to maintain their unity, control their own destiny,\r\nend the occupation of their territories, establish the\r\nmeans to administer their wealth, choose the provisions\r\nof their constitution and freely elect their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\nWar can be waged from the air by one side only.\r\nHowever, peace on the ground must be made with\r\nothers inside and outside of Iraq and with the United\r\nNations. Peace in Iraq and Iraqs destiny require that\r\nthe Iraqis be freed of occupation as soon as possible\r\nand that they work, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, in an expanded, pivotal and political role that\r\nis not restricted to social matters alone.\r\nThat is the fundamental appeal of the events and\r\ntragedies and of the people of Iraq. Only the ignorant\r\nor those pretending ignorance refuse to listen and to\r\ndraw lessons and conclusions before it is too late.\r\nThe beginning of this century has been marked by\r\nviolence and terrorism, whose worst manifestation has\r\nbeen the tragedies and crimes of 11 September and the\r\nsubsequent calls for extremism and clash of\r\ncivilizations, which prompt us to refuse to yield to the\r\nworst evils that threaten the peace and unity of our\r\nplanet.\r\nLebanon was among the first countries to be\r\ntargeted by terrorism, which was carried out by\r\nfundamentalist groups. It fought it with courage and\r\nresolve. At the same time, Lebanon still faces State\r\nterrorism practiced by Israel, which has caused the\r\ndeath, injury and displacement of thousands of\r\nLebanese and the destruction of essential facilities and\r\ninfrastructure. While we differentiate between\r\nterrorism and the right of peoples whose territories are\r\noccupied to resist and to liberate that land, within the\r\ncontext of international resolutions and the Charter, our\r\ncountry explicitly and strongly condemns all forms of\r\nterrorism, as it constitutes a threat to mankind as a\r\nwhole, regardless of race, colour or religion. Lebanon\r\nreaffirms its commitment to continue to cooperate with\r\nthe international community to fight this extremely\r\nharmful and damaging scourge.\r\nIn conclusion, I would be remiss if I did not\r\ncongratulate Mr. Hunte on his election as President of\r\nthe General Assembly and wish him success in his\r\nstewardship. I also would like to commend the tireless\r\nefforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to\r\npromote all opportunities for peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment in the world. Furthermore, I would like to\r\npay a tribute to the United Nations Interim Force in\r\nLebanon (UNIFIL) for its role in southern Lebanon.\r\nNow that Lebanon has been able to liberate most of its\r\nterritory, it is my hope that UNIFIL will fulfil the\r\nremainder of the mandate entrusted to it, as defined in\r\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978).\r\nLebanon has and always will be a country that\r\nrejects isolation and rigidity and that will remain open\r\nto dialogue and creative, rich, civilized human\r\ninteraction. Our country will always remain true to its\r\nmessage. Despite the challenges, we remain eager to\r\neffectively promote justice and the rule of law and\r\nuphold the values of freedom and democracy.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on Mr. Mircea Geoana, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Romania.\r\nMr. Geoana (Romania) (spoke in French): I wish\r\nto add Romanias voice to the heartfelt congratulations\r\nof others to His Excellency Mr. Julian Robert Hunte on\r\nhis election to the important position of President of\r\nthe General Assembly, wish him every success and\r\nassure him of our delegations full support.\r\nThe political debate of this session of the\r\nAssembly is being held in an international setting that\r\nrequires us to take a long, hard look at the way the\r\nUnited Nations can respond to the challenges facing us.\r\nThe recent terrorist attacks in Baghdad, which\r\ntook the lives of Ambassador Sergio Vieira de Mello\r\nand other brave members of the United Nations\r\ncommunity, as well as of Iraqis who had committed\r\nthemselves to restoring stability in their country,\r\nproved once more that the only language that fanatics\r\nuse is that of crime and terror. The best way to pay\r\n38\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\ntribute to the memory of those victims of terror is to\r\ncarry out, with redoubled determination, the mission to\r\nwhich they had dedicated their life.\r\nToday, the United Nations is called upon to\r\ncontinue to play a greater role in the service of good.\r\nOver the course of the past decade, the\r\nOrganization has accomplished a great deal, despite the\r\nseemingly insurmountable difficulties and certain\r\nevident limitations. Those obstacles sometimes grew\r\nout of a lack of shared perspectives regarding the\r\nproblems confronting us today. Yet, we have managed\r\nto keep world security under control.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs always at the United Nations, we are faced\r\nwith a challenge brought about by differing views\r\ntowards common problems. There is nothing new here,\r\nexcept for the magnitude of the consequences. We\r\ncannot afford to do nothing simply because we do not\r\nagree on everything. The United Nations is not about\r\nagreeing on everything. It is about building consensus.\r\nWe can do just that if we concentrate on negotiation \r\nnot language, but substance.\r\nIrrespective of how important the debate might\r\nbe, we should not be distracted today by talk of a\r\nunipolar, multipolar or even bipolar world. Rather, we\r\nshould concentrate on how we can govern our world in\r\na way that benefits the individual, brings about\r\nopportunity and pre-empts, deters and fights terrorism\r\nand aggression. If we are true to the principle of an\r\ninternational community dedicated to preserving peace\r\nand increasing prosperity, we should discuss how to\r\nachieve higher levels of international understanding,\r\nrather than the relevance of the United Nations system\r\ntoday, for we have to remember that true security is\r\nshared security, and true prosperity is shared\r\nprosperity.\r\nTo achieve this, we should also keep in mind that\r\nlegitimacy brings credibility that leads to predictability\r\nand predictability, brings long-term commonality of\r\nviews that is the cornerstone of lasting coalitions.\r\nThis is why we share the assessment of the\r\nSecretary-General, that The United Nations is not an\r\nend in itself. Rather it is an instrument for achieving\r\ncommon ends. (A/58/1, para. 10)\r\nOur belief that we, the Member States, must keep\r\nthe United Nations working with efficiency, with\r\npurpose and with result prompted Romania to put\r\nforward our candidature for membership in the\r\nSecurity Council starting next January. We thank the\r\nEastern European Group and others for their support\r\nfor us. This is a responsibility that we do not\r\nunderestimate. Our mission will be to uphold the\r\nvalidity of the United Nations as an essential\r\ninternational actor in preventing and resolving\r\nconflicts, eliminating poverty and promoting human\r\nrights.\r\nAs befits a State that will soon be a member of\r\nboth the European Union and NATO, we believe in the\r\nmultilateral approach to tackling terrorism, the\r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized\r\ncrime and violations of human rights.\r\nAs a country that has struggled to rebuild a\r\ndemocratic society based on the rule of law, a market\r\neconomy and respect for human rights, we understand\r\nthe complex challenges of transition that other\r\ncountries are also facing. It is not an easy process, but\r\nin our view it is the only way to guarantee durable\r\neconomic prosperity and social cohesion for the\r\ncitizen. We want to see a strengthening of the central\r\nrole of the United Nations in coordinating worldwide\r\nefforts to this end.\r\nRomanias international profile is defined by our\r\nlocation and our history and capability in Europe and\r\nby our transition experience. We are determined to play\r\na responsible role in connecting the West and East of\r\nour continent, and in reaching out to countries on the\r\nEastern shore of the Black Sea, the Caucasus and the\r\ngreater Middle East. We pledge to contribute to\r\nspreading Euro-Atlantic values beyond NATO and the\r\nEuropean Union areas by consistently promoting the\r\nculture of dialogue and regional cooperation.\r\nTerrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction, the rising number of failing States and\r\nglobal disparities are some of the most worrying\r\nhallmarks of our times. The speed and unevenness of\r\nglobal processes intensify the complexity and\r\npervasive nature of these threats to our common\r\nsecurity and prosperity.\r\nWe already possess an important range of tools to\r\ntackle threats like terrorism and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. They should now be used in a more\r\nresponsible and effective manner. For example, the\r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee should be given more\r\nprofessional resources so it can act more effectively to\r\n39\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nstreamline national legislation on uprooting the\r\nfinancial resources of terrorism and monitor its\r\nimplementation. International non-proliferation legal\r\nregimes should be strengthened in order to prevent\r\ndetermined proliferators from breaching their\r\ninternational obligations. Countries of concern with\r\nregard to proliferation could be subjected to diplomatic\r\nand economic pressure, which is most effective when\r\napplied multilaterally.\r\nChallenges to the security and stability of our\r\nworld also emerge as globalization processes expand.\r\nSustainable development is increasingly related to\r\nsustainable peace and security. Globalization is\r\ninevitable. Provided that it is combined with good\r\ngovernance, proper development assistance and\r\nawareness of environmental issues, as well as with fair\r\ntrade through open markets, globalization is a force for\r\nprogress. But global disparities are not disappearing.\r\nThe ratio of per capita incomes of the richest and\r\npoorest countries now stands at more than seventy to\r\none. So it is especially disappointing that the World\r\nTrade Organization talks in Cancún ended in deadlock.\r\nWe call on all parties to redouble their efforts in\r\nDecember to resume dialogue and close the gap. The\r\nsuccess we need is not just that of freer and more open\r\nmarkets, but also that of equitable trade, creating added\r\nvalue to regions, nations and communities.\r\nSustainable development demands first that we\r\nmanage globalization responsibly so that it benefits all.\r\nIt is time to focus on implementing the concrete goals\r\nof eradicating poverty and accelerating development.\r\nThe challenge will be to prioritize our work. Our focus\r\nat the High-level Dialogue on Financing for\r\nDevelopment at the end of next month should remain\r\nsquarely on achieving results.\r\nWe also must redouble our efforts to put an end to\r\nconflicts, and we must find a way to rebuild those\r\ncountries that have survived conflict but are struggling\r\nto survive peace. Africa is a particularly worrying\r\nexample of how dangerous it can be to ignore the\r\nconsequences of conflicts. The grave humanitarian\r\ncrises on that continent are foreboding a bleak future\r\nfor many countries and fomenting despair and far-\r\nreaching frustrations.\r\nThe international community has to be more\r\nengaged in addressing poverty, intolerance and ethnic\r\nhatred. We would like to see the United Nations\r\nenhance its peace operation capabilities and emphasize\r\nin particular the reconstruction and rehabilitation\r\nprocesses. We have done this in Afghanistan, yet it\r\nremains a test of our ability and willingness to secure a\r\nsuccessful democracy offensive in the fight against\r\nterrorism. I think we have enough at stake to stand by\r\nthat commitment.\r\nIn the Middle East, the new wave of violence is\r\npreventing the full implementation of the agreed road\r\nmap. Romania strongly condemns suicide bombings\r\nthat are carried out by the enemies of peace and\r\nsecurity in the area. We urge the new Palestinian\r\nGovernment to act effectively against further terrorist\r\nattacks targeting Israel and its citizens, but it is equally\r\nimportant that the Israeli Government stand by its\r\ncommitments in the framework of pursuing a political\r\nsolution to this bitter conflict. We fully support the\r\nactions of the Quartet that are meant to contribute to\r\novercoming this dangerous situation. We shall follow\r\nwith utmost interest the ministerial meeting that is\r\nscheduled for this week.\r\nIn Iraq, we believe it is time for the international\r\ncommunity to work together to stabilize and\r\nreconstruct that tragic country, whose people have\r\nsuffered so much under tyranny for so long. The\r\nsuccessful conclusion of negotiations on the new\r\nresolution concerning Iraq is not a mere option  it is\r\na must.\r\nWe need now to concentrate on what matters\r\nmost: the steps that must be taken next by the\r\ninternational community to empower the Iraqi people\r\nand to ensure the democratic functioning of institutions\r\nin that country and stability, not only in Iraq, but also\r\nin the greater Middle East as a whole. As a\r\nparticipating country in the Coalition Provisional\r\nAuthority, Romania is already engaged and ready to\r\ncontinue to contribute to achieving these goals. We are\r\nlooking forward to participating in the coming\r\nministerial conference on assistance for the Iraqi\r\npeople in Madrid this October.\r\nMany conflicts in the world stem from the\r\nbreakdown of nation-States. Porous borders, weak\r\nnational institutions and the development of alternative\r\nallegiances based on religious, economic and other\r\nfactors often lead to the collapse of State structures.\r\nThe principal feature of such States is the absence of\r\npolitical legitimacy, coupled with an uncontrolled or\r\nunaccountable security sector and contempt for the rule\r\nof law. That leads to violent conflict over control of\r\n40\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nresources or between different ethnic groups and to\r\nviolation of human rights and humanitarian law. Illegal\r\narms become readily accessible, organized crime and\r\nviolence flourish and economic prospects die.\r\nA good example of where the international\r\ncommunity has been successful in preventing the\r\nrelapse of a post-conflict situation is South-East\r\nEurope. The past year has seen real progress in this\r\nregion, due principally to the increased efforts of the\r\ncountries themselves, in partnership with the regional\r\ncommunity and with support from international\r\norganizations and partners. But certain problems\r\npersist. It is vital to press ahead with full commitment\r\nto meeting the responsibilities and timelines that have\r\nalready been accepted and to creating truly democratic\r\nand multi-ethnic societies. Combating organized crime\r\nand illegal trafficking, including the most degrading\r\nkind that turns human beings into commodities, is a\r\npriority in our regional approach.\r\nWe need to look at all these challenges with a\r\nnew determination to tackle them, making full and\r\neffective use of the tools available to us within the\r\nUnited Nations system. There has been much\r\ndiscussion of the ability of the United Nations to\r\nrespond to crises. The disadvantages of the present\r\nworking methods of its structures and mechanisms,\r\nwhich were conceived more than half a century ago,\r\ncall for radical reform. The real debate is about\r\neffectiveness, adaptation and evolution. It is about our\r\ncommon will, as responsible members of the\r\ninternational community, to act together. Everything\r\nelse  especially the badly needed strategies  will\r\nsimply follow, and this will make it possible to\r\napproach the new and old threats alike.\r\nThe United Nations must increasingly serve as a\r\ncatalyst for collective action. This requires close\r\ncooperation among its Member States, dialogue and\r\npartnership with the vibrant constellation of new non-\r\nState actors: civil society, non-governmental\r\norganizations, the business community and academia.\r\nFinally, the Organization must become more effective,\r\nefficient and accessible to the worlds people.\r\nWe must weigh up our differences, gauge our\r\nability for joint intervention and act in coordination.\r\nJust as the nature of current problems affects people in\r\neverything they do, so too must we put people at the\r\ncentre of everything we do.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the debate for this\r\nmeeting.\r\nA number of representatives have asked to speak\r\nin exercise of the right of reply. May I remind members\r\nthat, in accordance with General Assembly decision\r\n34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Choe Myong Nam (Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea): My delegation would like to\r\nexercise the right of reply to the allegations made by\r\nthe Japanese Foreign Minister, who yesterday referred\r\nto such issues as missiles, nuclear developments and\r\nabductions by the Democratic Peoples Republic of\r\nKorea.\r\nMy delegation categorically rejects these\r\nunsubstantiated allegations and accordingly wishes to\r\ndraw the attention of the General Assembly to the\r\nfollowing truth about the abduction issue.\r\nFirst, the issue of abduction is the product of the\r\nunprecedented hostile policy pursued by Japan against\r\nthe Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the\r\nrelations of intense hostility between the two countries\r\nthat have persisted for more than a century. During its\r\nmilitary occupation of Korea of more than 40 years,\r\nJapan inflicted unspeakable suffering, misfortune,\r\ndisaster and sacrifice upon the Korean people. For\r\nexample, Japan forcibly drafted and abducted more\r\nthan 8.4 million Koreans, killed 1 million and forced\r\n200,000 Korean girls and women to serve as comfort\r\nwomen for the Japanese military. This is only the tip of\r\nthe iceberg of all the atrocities and crimes against\r\nhumanity committed by Japan against the Korean\r\npeople. No single family in my country was safe from\r\nthe Japanese atrocities.\r\nUnder these circumstances, how can one dare to\r\ncompare the death of only a few abducted Japanese to\r\nthese myriad human casualties, amounting to\r\ngenocide? Notwithstanding this, Japan still refuses to\r\ndisclose the truth of its crimes and instead resorts to\r\nevery possible means of avoiding paying compensation\r\nto the victims. Consequently, anti-Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea hostility still persists today. Against\r\n41\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nsuch a backdrop, things like the abduction issue have\r\narisen.\r\nSecondly, the issue in question should naturally\r\nbe settled between the two countries. In accordance\r\nwith the historic Pyongyang Declaration, published on\r\n17 September 2002, and other bilateral agreements,\r\nboth countries committed themselves to resolving such\r\npending issues as this. The Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea Government has done everything in\r\nits power to bring about an early solution to the\r\nabduction issue. It has, among other things, provided\r\nall conveniences and necessary information to the\r\nvisiting Japanese delegation investigating the issue on\r\nthe Democratic Peoples Republic of Koreas soil. As a\r\nresult of our sincere cooperation, the issue has\r\nessentially been resolved. The only thing left now is to\r\nensure the safe return of the five survivors back to\r\nPyongyang.\r\nSurprisingly enough, however, Japan betrayed the\r\nPyongyang Declaration and reversed all its promises.\r\nIn the first instance, Japan has unilaterally abrogated\r\nits obligations under the bilateral agreement by\r\ndetaining five survivors of the abduction, who entered\r\nJapan for a period of 10 to 15 days on a home visit.\r\nThey were supposed to come back home to Pyongyang.\r\nThis is the response of the Japan authorities to the\r\nsincere and generous attitude of the Democratic\r\nPeoples Republic of Korea.\r\nThirdly, the issue in question is a humanitarian as\r\nwell as human rights issue that should in no way be\r\nabused for political purposes. Japan is only interested\r\nin politicizing this issue with a view to defaming the\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea. Japan is\r\nbringing this issue to international forums of any kind,\r\neven to the forum that is devoted to economic\r\nassistance. If Japan is genuinely interested in resolving\r\nthe pending issues, such as the abduction, it must\r\naddress its past crimes completely by disclosing all\r\nfacts of atrocities and duly compensating the victims.\r\nMr. Motomura (Japan): In response to the\r\nstatement just made by the representative of the\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea, I should like\r\nto take this opportunity on behalf of the Japanese\r\nGovernment to exercise the right of reply.\r\nThe Japanese Government does not think that the\r\nabduction issue has been resolved at all. It is all the\r\nmore important to correct this abnormal situation as\r\nsoon as possible, given that five abductees who came\r\nback to Japan last October after an absence of 25 years\r\nare still separated from the families they left behind in\r\nPyongyang. The return of the families must be realized.\r\nIt is also necessary for the abduction issue to be\r\nthoroughly resolved through all available measures,\r\nincluding fact-finding as to what actually happened.\r\nThere is no change in Japans basic position that\r\nwe should comprehensively resolve the abduction issue\r\nas well as the security issues, including the nuclear and\r\nthe missile problems, based on the Japan-Democratic\r\nPeoples Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration,\r\nthereby aiming at the normalization of diplomatic\r\nrelations with North Korea. The Japanese Government\r\nwould like to reiterate its strong request that North\r\nKorea take positive and responsible measures towards\r\nresolving these issues.\r\nWith regard to other points raised by the\r\nrepresentative of the Democratic Peoples Republic of\r\nKorea, in the light of the late hour I would like to\r\nreserve our right to exercise the right of reply some\r\ntime at a later stage during this session of the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): In his\r\nstatement in the general debate this morning, the Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Bolivia made a reference\r\nto my country that deserves a brief comment.\r\nChile is working with Bolivia on a future-\r\noriented bilateral agenda. Certainly, we are not\r\nanchored to the past. However, that bilateral process is\r\nbased on unreserved respect for valid, longstanding\r\ninternational treaties that set out obligations for both\r\nparties in a framework giving primacy to international\r\nlaw and established rules and aimed at cooperation and\r\neffective integration.\r\nMr. Choe Myong Nam (Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea): My delegation once again\r\ncategorically rejects the allegations just made by the\r\nrepresentative of Japan. I therefore feel there is no need\r\nto reiterate each of our positions, which have already\r\nbeen made known on several occasions.\r\nHowever, I believe it is important to underline the\r\nfact that if Japan is truly interested in resolving the\r\nabduction issue, it should remain faithful to the joint\r\ndeclaration of Japan and the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea and to all bilateral agreements,\r\nwhich constitute a landmark in normalizing relations\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\n42\r\nA/58/PV.10\r\nIn that context, we would like to ask Japan\r\nwhether it is willing actually to resume implementation\r\nof the joint declaration, which we believe Japan has\r\nalready betrayed, and to liquidate all its past crimes\r\nand atrocities against the Korean people, including, as I\r\nsaid, the forceful drafting and abducting of 8.4 million\r\nKoreans, the killing of 1 million and the imposing of\r\nsexual slavery to the Japanese military on 200,000\r\nKorean girls and women. We are asking the Japanese\r\nrepresentative this question because it is very much key\r\nto resolving of all pending issues, including the\r\nnormalization of relations between the Democratic\r\nPeoples Republic of Korea and Japan.\r\nSecondly, we are asking Japan whether it is\r\nwilling to be faithful to all bilateral agreements by\r\nreleasing five abduction survivors whom Japan has\r\ndetained during their stay in Japan for a home visit.\r\nThose survivors, who were supposed to come back to\r\nPyongyang to decide on their future in consultation\r\nwith their family members, have unfortunately been\r\ndetained by Japan. They have now been described in\r\nthe world mass media as the re-abducted.\r\nWe are asking these questions; whether Japan will\r\nremain faithful to all bilateral agreements, including by\r\nreleasing the five survivors that Japan has detained.\r\nAny failure on the part of Japan to provide an accurate,\r\ngenuine and adequate answer to those simple and\r\nessential questions may automatically lead us all to\r\nbelieve that Japan is not interested in resolving the\r\nissue but only in politicizing it. That should be\r\nvehemently rejected and opposed by this body of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Aranibar Quiroga (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): With respect to the exercise of the right of\r\nreply by the representative of Chile, I must reaffirm\r\nthat Bolivia does not and will not renounce its just\r\nclaim to sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean, because\r\nour nation was born as an independent republic with a\r\nmaritime coast. This claim, more than a century old, is\r\nthe product not of stubbornness or caprice but rather of\r\nthe insufficiency of our economic resources and the\r\nenormous geographic obstacles that hinder our\r\ncompetitiveness. Being landlocked has slowed our\r\ncountrys development and affected the welfare of our\r\ncitizens, as has been noted in assessments of the\r\nchallenges faced by all land-locked countries. It is ever\r\nmore clearly demonstrated in studies, including those\r\nof the United Nations system, that the lack of sovereign\r\nmaritime access is a factor of substantial negative\r\nimpact on the potential for economic growth of land-\r\nlocked countries. That is one more powerful reason for\r\nachieving the restoration of Bolivias sovereign access\r\nto the sea. That is justice and is for us irrevocable. That\r\nis why we ask the international community for its\r\nsolidarity and support.\r\nMr. Muñoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): My\r\ndelegation will not enter into a sterile debate with the\r\ndelegation of Bolivia. International law is clear and\r\nconclusive on this issue, as is our determination to\r\npursue cooperation and bilateral integration. Recent\r\nprogress on the economic integration of our two\r\ncountries speaks far more eloquently on this issue than\r\nanything I could say.\r\nMr. Motomura (Japan): The position of the\r\nJapanese Government with regard to the abduction case\r\nis what I set out in my first intervention.\r\nMr. Aranibar Quiroga (Bolivia) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): We all agree that truth, rights and legitimacy\r\nalways prevail in the end despite all efforts to resist\r\ntheir full development. We therefore agree with the\r\ninternational community and all those who wish to\r\nhave a constructive attitude in these difficult times. We\r\nreaffirm on this occasion the need to advance\r\nconstructively on the need to recognize Bolivias\r\nsovereign right to maritime access.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n"
