(Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of\r\nthe Republic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Papadopoulos: I would like to extend\r\nto you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its\r\nfifty-eighth session. We are indeed very happy to see a\r\nMinister from a fellow Commonwealth, and also an\r\nisland State, presiding over the session. I am sure that\r\nyour diplomatic skills, experience and grasp of the\r\nissues will harmoniously steer our work. I would also\r\nlike to express our thanks and appreciation to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the excellent record of\r\nhis presidency.\r\nThis year my country is about to fulfil its most\r\nambitious aspiration — joining the European Union.\r\nAfter having signed the accession treaty in April, we\r\nexpect to become a full member, along with nine other\r\nacceding countries, on 1 May 2004. But already we are\r\nassociated with the work of the Union and participate\r\nin all meetings and in the life of the new European\r\nfamily of the 25 members. Hence, Cyprus is represented\r\nby the statement of the Italian Presidency of the\r\nEuropean Union and fully subscribes to its contents.\r\nUnfortunately, the current session is taking place\r\nin a heavy and loaded atmosphere. The deadly attack\r\nagainst the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad\r\nlast month, as well as the most recent one of two days\r\nago, continue to fill us with bitterness and indignation.\r\nWe all share the feeling of great injustice and insult to\r\nthe international community. Once again, I wish to\r\nexpress our deep condolences to the victims’ families\r\nand our sympathy to those injured. At the same time,\r\nwe should also convey the message that such actions\r\nwill not deter us from the pursuit of the high ideals of\r\nthe United Nations and its engagement in Iraq.\r\nFrom Baghdad to Jakarta, from Russia to India,\r\nand back to the heinous attacks of 11 September two\r\nyears ago, terrorist acts around the globe serve as a\r\npainful reminder that terrorism transcends borders and\r\nattacks universal values. Freedom, democracy, human\r\nrights and humanity itself have to be defended by the\r\ninternational community with persistence and\r\ndetermination. At the same time, we should be cautious\r\nand ensure that our actions are fully in line with the\r\ncherished values we want to uphold. As the threat is\r\nunfortunately far from over, a genuine global\r\nmobilization, under the aegis of the United Nations, is\r\nof the essence if this endeavour is to be successful.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nCyprus is playing its part fully in this concerted effort\r\nand is among the countries that have ratified all 12 of\r\nthe international conventions pertaining to terrorism.\r\nFurthermore, it has recently ratified the United Nations\r\nConvention on the Safety of United Nations and\r\nAssociated Personnel of 1994.\r\nThe non-proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction has become, and rightly so, a top priority in\r\nthe world’s agenda. The risk of acquisition of such\r\nweapons by terrorist groups highlights even more the\r\ngravity and the urgency of the issues to be addressed.\r\nIn that respect, the United Nations has a truly\r\ninstrumental role to play. The universalization of, and\r\ncompliance with, multilateral treaties related to\r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, as well as verification\r\nmechanisms and internationally-coordinated export\r\ncontrols, are essential tools in our efforts. We have\r\nrepeatedly expressed our genuine commitment to\r\ninternational norms in the field of disarmament. I am\r\nhappy to report that Cyprus, earlier this year, ratified\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the\r\nOttawa Convention.\r\nThe Government of Cyprus attaches great\r\nimportance to the international effort against mine\r\nproliferation and the clearing of minefields. For this\r\nreason it has taken the initiative to clear all minefields\r\nlaid in the buffer zone by the Cyprus National Guard\r\nimmediately after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In\r\nthis regard, I would like to announce today my\r\nGovernment’s decision and firm commitment: first, to\r\nunilaterally start within the next two months, in\r\ncooperation with the United Nations and with the\r\nfinancial support of the European Union, mine\r\nclearance in the buffer zone and, secondly, to\r\nunilaterally proceed with the destruction of an\r\nappreciable amount of stockpiled antipersonnel mines\r\nthis year during the month of November. This is just a\r\nfirst step but, I believe, a major one in the\r\nimplementation of our obligations under the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction (Ottawa Convention).\r\nThis year again, the situation in the Middle East\r\nremains a source of major concern for the region and\r\nbeyond. The Quartet’s road map, with the\r\noverwhelming international support it enjoys,\r\nrepresents an historic opportunity that should not be\r\nmissed. Unfortunately, in recent days, the international\r\ncommunity has held its breath as blind and spiralling\r\nviolence thwarts the efforts to place and maintain on a\r\nsolid track this process which would lead to a\r\nsettlement. The necessary political will should be\r\ndemonstrated by both sides, at all levels, and be\r\nmatched with persistent action on the ground, in the\r\nright direction.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate\r\nour longstanding position for a just settlement, in\r\naccordance with international law, United Nations\r\nresolutions and the agreements reached between the\r\nparties, which will put an end to the occupation and\r\nrealize the aspirations of the Palestinian people for the\r\nestablishment of an independent state, side by side with\r\nIsrael, in peace and security. Cyprus, a country of the\r\nregion with traditionally close relations with both\r\nparties, stands ready to assist in every possible way.\r\nThe realization of the Charter’s vision of a just,\r\npeaceful and prosperous world remains inextricably\r\nlinked with the commitment to promote and protect\r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms in full\r\nconformity with their universal, indivisible and\r\ninterdependent nature.\r\nThe Republic of Cyprus, still witnessing serious\r\nviolations of human rights within its territory by\r\nforeign armed forces, places human rights at the very top\r\nof its agenda. While working hard for the promotion and\r\nprotection of the human rights of all its citizens under the\r\nharsh circumstances imposed by the invasion and\r\noccupation of a significant part of its territory, Cyprus\r\nnever loses sight of the universal dimension of human\r\nrights and remains active and resolutely watches over\r\nthe protection of human rights throughout the world. It\r\nreaffirms its full support of the Secretary General’s\r\nefforts to integrate human rights into the whole range\r\nof United Nations activities and reiterates its\r\ncommitment to working closely with United Nations\r\npartners towards their universal implementation.\r\nWe still strive in Cyprus for establishing the fate\r\nof all those Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish, missing\r\nsince the Turkish invasion of 1974. This is a major\r\nissue of a purely humanitarian character and we seek\r\nthe support of the international community as a whole\r\nin order to put an end, at last, to the continuing ordeal\r\nof so many families. For this to happen, the\r\ncooperation and political will of the Republic of\r\nTurkey are absolutely necessary.\r\nFurthermore, the rights of the few remaining\r\nenclaved persons in the occupied part of Cyprus\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\ncontinue to be violated. The rights of the refugees are\r\nalso still being denied, while our people face new faits\r\naccomplis by the occupation army, as in the case of the\r\nadvance of the Turkish Army in the area of Strovilia.\r\nWith the assistance of the international community we\r\nare, nevertheless, resolved to persevere in the\r\nimplementation of international conventions and for\r\nthe restoration of the human rights of all Cypriots.\r\nIn view of the new challenges that the United\r\nNations is required to face, Cyprus strongly supports\r\nthe Secretary General’s United Nations objectives,\r\nwhich aim at adapting the internal structures and\r\nculture of the Organization to new expectations. It\r\ntherefore welcomes the work done on strengthening the\r\nmanagement and administration — as well as\r\nstreamlining the budget — of the United Nations.\r\nMy country also attaches great importance to the\r\nimprovement of the intergovernmental structure and\r\nprocesses of the United Nations and the revitalization\r\nof the General Assembly as essential elements of the\r\nreform process, whose aim is to bring about a stronger\r\nUnited Nations system that will be able to effectively\r\npursue the priorities adopted in the United Nations\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nWe certainly need effectiveness but we cannot\r\nseparate it from legitimacy. In Cyprus, we know, from\r\nour own experience, both the importance of legitimacy\r\nand the need for effectiveness. We have been facing the\r\ncatastrophic results of aggression and we have been\r\nstruggling for more than 29 years for the solution of\r\nthe problem created by the invasion and occupation of\r\nthe northern part of our country by Turkey.\r\nDespite all efforts, Turkish intransigence has not\r\nbeen curbed and their defiance of numerous resolutions\r\nof the General Assembly and of the Security Council\r\ncontinues unabated. Such an attitude constitutes not\r\nonly unacceptable behaviour in international relations\r\nbut is also completely anachronistic and\r\nincomprehensible to any rational thought. Furthermore\r\nit is at variance with the will and the wish of the\r\noverwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots themselves\r\nwho are persistently asking for a solution and for\r\nparticipation in the accession of Cyprus to the European\r\nUnion. We continue, as far as we are concerned, to do\r\nour best to bring them on board and we have embarked\r\non an ambitious policy in order to enhance their\r\nstandard of living and allow them to fully enjoy the\r\nrights and benefits that they are entitled to as Cypriots.\r\nIn Cyprus, we have faced adversity for so many\r\nyears and we have survived. Hence, we know that we\r\nhave to persevere. We still believe in the United\r\nNations and we are grateful for its interest and\r\ninvolvement. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nexpress our sincere thanks to the Secretary-General for\r\nhis tireless efforts within the framework of his mission\r\nof good offices in Cyprus, entrusted to him by the\r\nSecurity Council. I would like also to praise the work\r\nof the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Álvaro de Soto, and all members of his team, of his\r\nassistant of the United Nations Mission, as well as of\r\nthe United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and\r\nof the contributing countries. I believe that it is\r\nappropriate to mention this here at this stage because,\r\nas you all know, the continuing and longstanding\r\nTurkish intransigence thwarted a few months ago what\r\nwas probably the strongest initiative ever of the United\r\nNations for finding a solution in Cyprus.\r\nWe understand and share the bitterness and the\r\ndisappointment of all involved regarding this failure\r\nbut, as I said before, we should not give up. We have\r\nalways counted on United Nations support and\r\ninvolvement and we will continue to do so. We are\r\nalways ready, whenever the Secretary-General invites\r\nus, to engage in serious negotiations on the basis of his\r\nplan in order to reach a settlement as soon as possible,\r\nin conformity with relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nWe hope that it will soon be possible for the other side\r\nto realize that they have to return to the negotiating\r\ntable, to cooperate constructively with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and to demonstrate the necessary political will\r\nto yield a settlement.\r\nA solution is urgently needed in Cyprus, a\r\nfunctional and viable solution that will embrace all\r\nCypriots and will allow our country to take its stride\r\nand fully assume its place and role within the European\r\nfamily. A united Cyprus in a united Europe will thrive\r\nand progress with its partners towards a secure and\r\nprosperous future, working hand in hand with all other\r\nmembers of the international community for the\r\npromotion of universal values and peace.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Cyprus for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tassos Papadopoulos, President of the\r\nRepublic of Cyprus, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Vladimir V. Putin,\r\nPresident of the Russian Federation\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian\r\nFederation, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Vladimir Putin, President\r\nof the Russian Federation, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Putin (spoke in Russian): Once again,\r\nI am delighted to have this opportunity to address this\r\nrepresentative audience. At the outset, however, I\r\nshould like to wish the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly fruitful work — work to\r\nsuccessfully harmonize the actions of peoples and\r\nStates; work on behalf of peace, security and progress.\r\nThose purposes were set out in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations by our predecessors, but, as we can see,\r\nthey are still relevant. Even now, they provide a solid,\r\nlong-term foundation for the activities of the United\r\nNations. And, although the structure and the functions\r\nof the Organization took shape in an international\r\nenvironment fundamentally different from ours, time\r\nhas only reaffirmed their universal importance. Today,\r\nthe instruments of the United Nations are not merely in\r\ndemand; they are, as life itself has shown, simply\r\nirreplaceable in crucial situations.\r\nThat has been made abundantly clear by the\r\nfollowing important fact: despite sharp differences\r\nconcerning how to resolve the Iraq crisis, the situation\r\nis ultimately returning to the legal sphere of the United\r\nNations. Russia’s position in that regard is consistent\r\nand clear. Only direct United Nations participation in\r\nIraq’s reconstruction will enable Iraq’s people to decide\r\ntheir future. And only with active and — I want to stress\r\nthis — practical United Nations assistance in Iraq’s\r\neconomic and civil transformation will Iraq assume a\r\ntruly new and worthy place in the world community.\r\nIt is clear that, in recent years, the United Nations\r\nhas increasingly been obliged to carry out\r\nfundamentally new tasks and to tackle threats that are\r\ndifferent from, but just as serious as, those it faced\r\nbefore. Three years ago, at the 2000 Millennium\r\nSummit, I said here that the common enemy of the\r\nUnited Nations was terrorism. Was Russia’s voice\r\nheeded then? Did everyone understand the seriousness\r\nof the threat, and were our joint actions adequate? The\r\nevents of 11 September proved that, unfortunately, they\r\nwere not.\r\nTo us in Russia, however, the style of the\r\nmurderers who committed terrorist acts in Moscow, in\r\nChechnya and elsewhere in Russia and in New York, as\r\nwell as against United Nations staff in Baghdad, has\r\nlong been painfully familiar. That style is identical\r\neverywhere, and the fact that the inciters of terror are\r\neasily recognizable — with regard to both the events of\r\nAugust this year and the terrorist attacks of previous\r\nyears — only attests to the global nature of this threat.\r\nIt is true that now we are listening to one another.\r\nAnd we understand that the United Nations must\r\nbecome — and is indeed becoming — the basis for a\r\nglobal anti-terrorist coalition. Here, I wish to take\r\nparticular note of the Security Council’s Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee. Terrorism is a challenge to the\r\nplanet’s security and to its economic future. Therefore,\r\nthe Committee must become a real and practical\r\ninstrument for effectively fighting the terrorist threat.\r\nI should like to focus in particular on the\r\nhumanitarian activities of the United Nations. That area\r\nconsumes the lion’s share of the Organization’s energy,\r\ntime and resources, but it does not always appear in the\r\nheadlines, nor is it always familiar to the citizens of the\r\nmore prosperous States. But it is precisely that area of\r\nUnited Nations work that is so fundamental and\r\nirreplaceable. The United Nations is helping millions\r\nof destitute people throughout the world — victims of\r\nhunger, of disease and of conflict — to survive and not\r\nto lose hope. That work is exceptionally important; it\r\nlends indisputable political and moral authority to the\r\nentire Organization. And it is here that the\r\ninterrelationship between the moral and political content\r\nof international activities is particularly evident.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank all\r\nstaff members of the United Nations, all non-\r\ngovernmental organizations and, of course, the many\r\nvolunteers who are participating in this noble work.\r\nBecause we understand how valuable the\r\nOrganization’s humanitarian mission is, Russia views it\r\nas a major political endeavour. We are already\r\ncontributing to this work, and we are committed to\r\nincreasing our contribution. Over the past three years,\r\nRussia has forgiven a total of $27.2 billion in debt of\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\ndeveloping countries, and we are currently granting\r\nsignificant tariff preferences to such countries.\r\nFor the first time in many years, as our country\r\nhas grown, it has become a donor to the United Nations\r\nWorld Food Programme. The horrors of starvation are\r\nwell known to us from our own history. As a result of\r\nthe civil war of the past century and the forced\r\ncollectivization of the 1920s and 1930s, millions of\r\npeople died of starvation in the Volga region, in Northern\r\nCaucasus and in other parts of our country. Hunger\r\nbecame a national tragedy for the peoples of Ukraine as\r\nwell. We consider it our moral and ethical duty to\r\nexpand our participation in food aid programmes.\r\nRussia intends to work actively to resolve acute\r\nenvironmental problems. A milestone will be achieved\r\nin that area by the World Conference on Climate\r\nChange, scheduled to convene next week in Russia’s\r\ncapital, Moscow. We also believe it is essential that a\r\nglobal system be established to monitor and neutralize\r\ndangerous infectious diseases, and we consider the\r\nwork done by the Global Fund to be a real\r\ndemonstration of international solidarity in fighting the\r\nspread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\r\nOf course, the United Nations, like any system\r\nwith a complex structure, needs to be improved. But\r\nthe Organization’s past and current problems have never\r\nbeen problems of only the Organization per se; they have\r\nalways been created by — and they continue to reflect —\r\ncontradictions in the very system of international\r\nrelations, particularly the system of international law.\r\nAfter all, politicians, including those represented in the\r\nUnited Nations, including the Security Council, do not\r\nalways have at their disposal adequate and effectively\r\nfunctioning legal instruments — instruments that would\r\nenable them to deal effectively with the international and\r\nregional crises that arise. International law must, of\r\ncourse, be fluid and living, reflecting the realities of\r\nthe contemporary world. I believe that many of the\r\nprocesses that are under way within the United Nations\r\nalso attest to the constant changes that are taking place\r\nin the world. Such changes dictate a logic of evolution\r\nin the United Nations.\r\nMembers of the Organization know very well\r\nthat, as a rule, all of the achievements of the United\r\nNations are shared successes, and that our failures are\r\nshared miscalculations. Such knowledge, however,\r\nbrings with it great responsibility. First and foremost,\r\nwe must be extremely careful about interfering with the\r\nfabric — the mechanisms — of the work of the United\r\nNations. Clearly, behind any such decision there should\r\nbe more than general political rhetoric — mere words\r\nabout so-called fair policies.\r\nI am convinced that any attempt to modernize\r\nUnited Nations instruments must be preceded by\r\nserious analysis and careful calculation. Such an\r\napproach should be taken, first and foremost, with\r\nregard to the principal international legal instruments.\r\nAfter all, guaranteeing that they remain effective is the\r\nonly way to avoid a legal vacuum. As long as the\r\nnorms of international law remain unchanged and\r\noperative, we must observe them. We must ensure\r\ncontinuity of security guarantees for States and for the\r\nworld as a whole.\r\nWe must analyse United Nations structures and\r\nmechanisms and try to understand which have proved\r\neffective and productive, as well as which have done\r\nthe job they were intended to do and which now remain\r\nunused. We should remember that much of the\r\npotential of the United Nations has still to be tapped.\r\nThere are many resources that we are only now\r\nlearning how to use.\r\nI would like in particular to comment on the need\r\nto enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council. I\r\nam convinced that, given the deep-rooted nature of the\r\ncurrent differences of opinion and the importance of\r\nensuring that the Council remain effective, we must\r\nwork gradually and very cautiously.\r\nWe believe that at this stage we should be guided\r\nabove all by the broadest possible agreement on all\r\naspects of the expansion of the Council, as well as by\r\nthe need to ensure that it maintains its current high\r\nstatus and the legitimacy born of agreed actions. After\r\nall, the Security Council, as the Charter makes clear,\r\nacts on behalf of the United Nations. The Security\r\nCouncil is endowed with a specific mechanism for\r\nharmonizing political will and for protecting the\r\nnational interests of a great variety of States, and,\r\nthrough this, the interests of the entire international\r\ncommunity.\r\nIt is true that we often hear that the developed\r\ncountries bear special responsibility for the destiny of\r\nthe world. Such leadership, however, entails major\r\nobligations, primarily to ensure that the interests of the\r\ninternational community as a whole are reflected.\r\nBeing a world Power means working together with the\r\nworld community. Being a truly strong, influential\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nState means seeing and helping to resolve the problems\r\nof small and economically weak countries.\r\nIn that connection, I believe that it would be\r\nuseful to intensify the work that is being carried out by\r\nthe United Nations in cooperation with the regional\r\ninternational structures. That will lead directly towards\r\nincreased economic prosperity in various parts of the\r\nworld, and thus contribute to the containment of\r\npotential threats and the maintenance of a common\r\nglobal strategic balance.\r\nWe welcome the emergence of regional centres\r\nfor coordination and cooperation in a united Europe.\r\nWe favour the strengthening of integration processes in\r\nthe Asia-Pacific region. And of course, we support the\r\nwork of the Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n(CIS), as well as that of the Collective Security Treaty\r\nOrganization and the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization, whose authority and effectiveness are\r\ncontinuing to grow.\r\nRussia is not the only country that is interested in\r\nregional integration. Our CIS partners have also\r\ndemonstrated their practical commitment to that same\r\ngoal. This was reaffirmed during the recent CIS\r\nsummit. We consider the development of our\r\ninteraction with the European Union, which is\r\nmultifaceted in nature, to be important. Likewise, with\r\nregard to security issues, we attach importance to the\r\nsearch new forms of cooperation with the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization.\r\nWe should counter current threats to civilization\r\nonly by means of collective responses whose legitimacy\r\nis not in doubt. In this respect, we need a systemic vision\r\nthat combines political with, when necessary, military\r\nmeasures. Such measures should be agreed upon in\r\nadvance, and be sensible and appropriate.\r\nThe need to improve the peacekeeping\r\nmechanisms of the United Nations remains on the\r\nOrganization’s agenda. The United Nations must be\r\nable to deploy peacekeeping — and, where necessary,\r\npeace-enforcement — operations more quickly and\r\nefficiently, in strict compliance with the United Nations\r\nCharter. I should like to note that Russia, which has\r\nalways supported the peacekeeping functions of the\r\nOrganization, is prepared to step up its participation in\r\nsuch operations, both under United Nations auspices\r\nand in coalition operations authorized by the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nand their delivery systems remains a serious challenge\r\nto the modern world. The most dangerous challenge is\r\nthe possibility of their falling into the hands of\r\nterrorists. We know what steps must be taken in order\r\nto eliminate such threats. These include the further\r\nuniversalization of the existing non-proliferation\r\nregimes, the strengthening of international verification\r\ninstruments and the introduction of safe technologies in\r\nnuclear energy production. In general, this requires the\r\nrenunciation by States of excessive arsenals and\r\nmilitary programmes that could undermine the political\r\nand military balance and trigger an arms race.\r\nRussia believes that it is extremely important to\r\nprevent the militarization of outer space. We believe\r\nthat a comprehensive agreement should be elaborated\r\non this issue, and invite all countries possessing\r\npotential in this area to join our initiative. The Russian\r\ninitiative to set up, under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, a global system to counter these new threats has\r\nalready been supported by the General Assembly. We\r\npropose the adoption of a new resolution during this\r\nsession setting out specific further steps in this direction.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall that the solid\r\nstructure of the United Nations has enabled it to\r\nwithstand all of the many crises of the second half of\r\nthe twentieth century. It has helped to overcome threats\r\nof global confrontation and, most importantly, helped\r\nto promote human rights. It has also helped to assert\r\nthe principles of mutual respect and good-neighbourliness\r\namong States. The main thrust of the United Nations\r\napproach is that humankind has no alternative but to\r\njointly construct a safer, fairer and more prosperous\r\nworld. That is our duty to succeeding generations. In\r\nthat important task we can have no better help than\r\nsuch time-tested instruments as the work of the United\r\nNations, an Organization that, for half a century, took\r\ndecisions that were crucial for the entire world.\r\nRussia is convinced that the United Nations must\r\nmaintain its central role in international affairs. This is\r\nparticularly relevant, and particularly important, for\r\nresolving conflict situations. This is our choice and our\r\nstrategic position of principle.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Russian\r\nFederation for the statement he has just made.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nMr. Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian\r\nFederation, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of\r\nthe Argentine Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Argentine Republic.\r\nMr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of the\r\nArgentine Republic, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner,\r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kirchner (spoke in Spanish): At the\r\noutset, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your\r\nelection to preside over the Assembly at this session. I\r\nwould also like to congratulate the outgoing President,\r\nMr. Jan Kavan, for his work at the head of this\r\nAssembly at the previous session.\r\nOn behalf of my Government, we would also like\r\nto reiterate our gratitude for the efforts of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, to promote peace\r\nand multilateralism, and to express our solidarity in\r\nwake of the criminal attack that claimed the lives of\r\nseveral staff members of this Organization.\r\nWe have come from the world’s South to the\r\nGeneral Assembly with a firm belief that revitalizing\r\nthis global representative forum is essential for\r\ninternational law to become once again a rational\r\ninstrument for resolving conflicts and facing threats.\r\nRestoring the major political role that the Assembly\r\nplayed in the early days of the United Nations is key to\r\nstrengthening security for all citizens of the world.\r\nIndeed, multilateralism is the cornerstone of this\r\nOrganization. But the cold war and bipolarity that\r\ncharacterized the world after the Yalta Conference until\r\nthe fall of the Berlin Wall undoubtedly shaped the\r\ninstruments and legislation that were adopted within\r\nthat framework.\r\nAny objective look at the international situation\r\nthat that goes beyond the particular biases of individual\r\nMembers of the Organization will reveal another\r\nhallmark of the world today: the technological, military\r\nand economic supremacy of one country over all the\r\nrest. We therefore consider it necessary to reaffirm our\r\ndetermined support for the purposes and principles that\r\nunderpin the United Nations, so that it can actively\r\nwork to promote peace and the social and economic\r\ndevelopment of humanity.\r\nBut, it bears repeating, we must not limit our\r\ncommitment to multilateralism to words alone.\r\nPromoting multilateralism requires a dual strategy.\r\nFirst, an open mind is needed to objectively grasp the\r\nfull extent of the new state of affairs. Secondly, we\r\nneed to reconsider the instruments and rules so to cope\r\nwith this new reality just as was done during the era of\r\nbipolar politics in order to save the world from\r\ndestruction. Multilateralism and security are inseparable\r\nbut are not the only factors in this new equation.\r\nThe world is changing against the backdrop of a\r\nglobalization that is creating unprecedented\r\nopportunities and risks. The greatest risk is the\r\nwidening gap between the rich and poor. To divide the\r\nworld into central and marginal countries is not merely\r\nan academic exercise or a matter of ideology. Quite the\r\ncontrary, such definitions reflect a grim reality of\r\nunprecedented poverty and social exclusion. Our\r\npriority must be to ensure that globalization works for\r\nall, and not just for the few. Promoting the\r\ndevelopment of the marginalized countries is no longer\r\nsimply a matter of social conscience on the part of the\r\ncentral countries. It has an impact on their situation and\r\nsecurity. Hunger, illiteracy, exclusion and ignorance are\r\nsome of the basic elements that fuel the spread of\r\ninternational terrorism and cause violent and massive\r\nnational migration flows, which have cultural, social\r\nand economic consequences. They also inevitably\r\nthreaten the security of the central countries.\r\nEconomic integration and political\r\nmultilateralism hold the key to safer future world. We\r\nneed to build global institutions and effective\r\npartnerships within the framework of fair and open\r\ntrade and to bolster support for the development of\r\nthose most in need. If we are to promote collective\r\nsecurity intelligently, we must understand that security\r\nis not just a military issue; it depends on political,\r\neconomic, social and cultural factors as well. These are\r\nthe key challenges on the current international agenda\r\nthat the main actors must meet.\r\nIn this framework, the relations between\r\ncountries like ours and others in the international\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\ncommunity are affected by a huge and crushing burden\r\nof debt owed to multilateral financial institutions and\r\nprivate creditors. We accept our share of responsibility\r\nfor having adopted policies that caused this\r\nindebtedness. But we also call on the international\r\nfinancial institutions — which contributed to,\r\nencouraged and promoted the growth of that debt by\r\ndictating their terms — to accept their own share of\r\nresponsibility. It goes without saying that when debt\r\ngrows to such an extent, not only the debtor but also\r\nthe creditor bears responsibility. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to acknowledge the tangible, verifiable and\r\nrather obvious fact that repaying such a debt entails\r\ngreat hardships.\r\nWithout specific international assistance to\r\nenable indebted countries to restore economic solvency\r\nand thereby their ability to repay debts and without\r\nmeasures to foster their growth and their sustainable\r\ndevelopment by taking concrete steps to promote their\r\nmarket access and growth of exports, debt repayment\r\nremains a pipedream. Promoting exports of finished\r\nproducts based on the natural resources that most\r\nindebted countries have can lay the foundations for\r\nsustainable development, without which creditors will\r\nhave to face their losses without any other realistic\r\noptions.\r\nNo one is known to have succeeded in getting\r\ntheir money back from the dead. To reach the objective\r\nof making a country viable so it can pay its debts,\r\nintensified multilateral negotiations are greatly needed\r\nto eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers that hinder\r\naccess of our exports to the markets of the developed\r\ncountries, which have the largest purchasing capacity.\r\nIndeed, there continue to be export and production\r\nsubsidies in the international trade in food products —\r\nArgentina’s main export item — as well as tariffs,\r\nunjustified sanitary measures and trade restrictions that\r\ndistort the terms of trade in commodities and seriously\r\nhamper market access for finished products.\r\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\r\nnegotiations in Cancún should serve as a wake-up call\r\nto us in this regard and should be remedied by making\r\nthe greatly sought-after link between business\r\nopportunities in international trade and the growth of\r\nindebted countries and their debt-repayment capacity. It\r\nis paradoxical and even ridiculous that we should be\r\ncalled upon to repay our debt while we are being\r\nprevented from trading and selling our products.\r\nOn the other hand, although it is true that the\r\nobjectives of the multilateral institutions, such as the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), include shortening\r\nthe duration and lessening the imbalance of payments\r\nof member countries and instilling confidence by\r\ngiving them opportunities for readjustment, without\r\ntaking measures that undermine national or\r\ninternational prosperity, it is also necessary to redesign\r\nthose multilateral institutions. Redesigning multilateral\r\nlending agencies should include changing the models\r\nso that the success or failure of economic policies is\r\nmeasured in terms of success or failure in the fight for\r\ndevelopment, equitable distribution, the fight against\r\npoverty and maintaining adequate levels of employment.\r\nThis new millennium should banish adjustment\r\nmodels in which the prosperity of some is based on the\r\npoverty of others. The dawn of the twenty-first century\r\nshould mean the end of an age and the beginning of a\r\nnew collaboration among creditors and debtors.\r\nIn a nutshell, it is essential to take note of the\r\nclose connection that exists between security,\r\nmultilateralism and economics.\r\nThe defence of human rights occupies a central\r\nplace in the new agenda of the Argentine Republic. We\r\nare the children of the mothers and grandmothers of the\r\nPlaza de Mayo, and we therefore insist on permanently\r\nsupporting the strengthening of the system for the\r\nprotection of human rights and the trial and conviction\r\nof those who violate them. All of this is based on the\r\noverarching view that respect for persons and their\r\ndignity arises out of principles preceding the\r\ndevelopment of law, whose origins can be traced to the\r\nbeginnings of human history. Respecting diversity and\r\npluralism and relentlessly fighting impunity have been\r\nunwavering principles of our country ever since the\r\ntragedy of recent decades.\r\nWe strongly advocate a peaceful settlement of\r\ninternational disputes, particularly in a matter as dear\r\nto our feelings and interests as our sovereignty dispute\r\nwith regard to the Malvinas, South Georgia and the South\r\nSandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nThe United Nations has recognized that this is a\r\ncolonial situation maintained by the United Kingdom\r\nand that it must be settled through bilateral\r\nnegotiations between the Argentine Republic and the\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nUnited Kingdom. We value the role of the United\r\nNations Special Committee on Decolonization and\r\nexpress our fullest willingness to negotiate in order to\r\nconclusively settle this longstanding dispute, a steady\r\nobjective of the Argentina Republic. We urge the\r\nUnited Kingdom to agree to resume bilateral\r\nnegotiations to resolve this major issue.\r\nAlso with reference to the Southern regions, we\r\nundertake to protect the interests of the international\r\ncommunity in Antarctica, ensuring that the activities\r\ncarried out there are consistent with the Antarctic\r\nTreaty and its 1991 Madrid Protocol on Environmental\r\nProtection. We shall take steps at the relevant forums\r\nfor the installation of the authorities and the operation\r\nof the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat at its designated\r\nseat, Buenos Aires.\r\nWe express our support and wish for a stable and\r\nlasting peace in the Middle East based on the\r\ninalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-\r\ndetermination and an independent and viable State,\r\nwhile at the same time recognizing the right of Israel to\r\nlive at peace with its neighbours within safe and\r\ninternationally recognized borders.\r\nWe have spoken of progress and collective\r\nsecurity as the global challenges of today. We have\r\nhighlighted the close link that exists between economic\r\nproblems and security. We firmly condemn all terrorist\r\nactions. We know what we are talking about. In 1992\r\nand 1994 we suffered, first hand, our own Twin\r\nTowers. The attacks on the Israeli Embassy and the\r\nAMIA Jewish Community Center took the lives of over\r\n100 of our compatriots. We can bear witness to the\r\nneed to fight effectively against the new threats posed\r\nby international terrorism.\r\nThe vulnerability of all countries in the\r\ninternational community to this scourge can be reduced\r\nonly through intelligent, concerted and multilateral\r\naction sustained over time. The fight against terrorism\r\nrequires a new rationality. We face an enemy whose\r\nlogic is to trigger reactions symmetrical to its actions.\r\nThe worse, the better, is the favoured scenario, and that\r\nlogic partly accounts for the increasingly spectacular\r\n— almost cinematographic — nature of its operations.\r\nLegitimate responses and the support of international\r\npublic opinion are both fundamental to confronting\r\nthose new forms of violence.\r\nThis view places the problem of international\r\nterrorism in a dimension that goes beyond a unilateral\r\nor military solution. On the contrary, merely\r\nresponding through the use of force, however\r\nimpressive such force may be or appear to be, in many\r\ncases ends with the perpetrators being presented as\r\nvictims. This closes in a perfect circle the perverse\r\nlogic to which we have been referring.\r\nAs we see, in view of the complexity of the\r\nsituation, it is no longer useful to take shelter in old\r\nalignments, anachronistic ways of thinking or outdated\r\nstructures. The new challenges call for different and\r\ncreative solutions so as not to be left behind by changes\r\nin the world in the technological, economic, social and\r\nundoubtedly even cultural fields.\r\nLet us rise to the challenge of thinking anew for a\r\nnew world. To combine different ideas and create\r\npractical means to put them into practice in the service\r\nof the people we represent is our duty.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the\r\nArgentine Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Néstor Carlos Kirchner, President of the\r\nArgentine Republic was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Dato’ Seri Mahathir Mohamad,\r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Malaysia.\r\nDato’ Seri Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister of\r\nMalaysia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Dato’ Seri Mahathir\r\nMohamad, Prime Minister of Malaysia, and inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mahathir (Malaysia): Sir, may I, as Prime\r\nMinister of Malaysia and Chairman of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement, offer my sincere congratulations to the\r\nPresident on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident that\r\ngiven his wisdom, experience and diplomatic skill, he\r\nwill be able to steer the proceedings of this session to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. I wish to assure him of the\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nfullest cooperation of the Malaysian delegation. I\r\nstrongly believe that the members of the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement would similarly render their full support\r\nand cooperation to him.\r\nAllow me also to pay tribute to his predecessor,\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan, for his dedication and\r\nthe effective manner in which he conducted the work\r\nof the fifty-seventh session. I also commend the\r\nSecretary-General for his efforts and perseverance, and\r\nI salute the men and women who had dedicated and\r\ngiven their lives in the service of the United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly has been conceived as a\r\nforum for the nations of the world, big and small, to air\r\ntheir views and grievances freely, as the stakeholders in\r\nthe governance of the international community.\r\nUnfortunately, it is subservient to the Security Council,\r\nwhich in turn is subservient to any single one of the five\r\nvictors of a war fought more than half a century ago. It\r\nis hardly a democratic forum, but it is all that the great\r\ncivilization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first\r\ncenturies has — a civilization that is supposed to\r\nuphold freedom.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nStill we, the small nations, have much to be\r\ngrateful for. From being the colonies of the Europeans,\r\nwe are now independent and we are granted\r\nmembership of the United Nations with the right to\r\nspeak, albeit with proper restraint and decorum, in this\r\nAssembly. As independent nations, we believe that we\r\nhave a right to manage our internal affairs ourselves\r\nwithout foreign interference.\r\nWe admit that there are abuses in the management\r\nof our countries by some of our Governments, but our\r\ndetractors should remember that they, too, abused their\r\nGovernments’ power when they seized land belonging\r\nto indigenous peoples and exterminated them, claiming\r\nthat it was their “manifest destiny”, the “white man’s\r\nburden”, to bring civilization by setting up their own\r\ncountries in these lands and confining the indigenous\r\npeoples to barren reserves, with no role in the\r\nGovernment of the new nations. What they did to the\r\nindigenous peoples is not out of character, for in their\r\nown countries they carried out pogroms against the\r\nJews, inquisitions and mock trials, torture and killing\r\nby burning at the stake.\r\nWe all carry the baggage of history, but we would\r\nwillingly leave it behind were it not for the fact that\r\nhistory has a nasty habit of repeating itself. Today, we\r\nare seeing the resurgence of European imperialism. At\r\nfirst, we thought that the colonization would be virtual.\r\nMerely by economic strangulation and financial\r\nemasculation, the newly independent countries could\r\nbe brought to their knees, begging to be recolonized in\r\nother forms. Today, however, we are actually facing the\r\nold physical occupation by foreign forces. Puppet\r\nregimes are installed, dancing as puppets do.\r\nThis institution, the United Nations, in which we\r\nhad pinned so much hope, despite the safeguards\r\nsupposed to be provided by the permanent five, is\r\ntoday collapsing on its clay feet, helpless to protect the\r\nweak and the poor. This United Nations can just be\r\nignored, pushed aside, gesticulating feebly as it\r\nstruggles to be relevant. Its organs have been cut out,\r\ndissected and reshaped so that they may perform the\r\nway the puppetmasters want. The World Bank, the\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Trade\r\nOrganization have now been turned into instruments of\r\nhegemony to impoverish the poor and enrich the rich.\r\nIt is not surprising that today the disparities between\r\nrich and poor are far greater than ever.\r\nWith an impotent United Nations and its agencies\r\nturned into national organs of the powerful, the small\r\nnations are now naked and hapless. Even if we are\r\ntotally innocent, there is nothing to prevent trumped-up\r\ncharges being brought against us.\r\nWe feel a great need for the integrity and\r\ncredibility of the United Nations to be restored.\r\nFortunately, the breach of international norms has been\r\nby countries which are reputedly tolerant of free speech\r\nand the rights of others. When criticisms are forbidden,\r\nthe abuses will increase until they become intolerable\r\nand revolt takes place, with all the destruction that\r\naccompanies it. That was what happened with Saddam\r\nHussein on a national scale. That can also happen on an\r\ninternational scale. Free speech provides the safety\r\nvalve, the absence of which must eventually lead to an\r\nexplosion.\r\nSince the Asian financial crisis in 1997, Malaysia\r\nhas not been able to recover fully. This crisis was\r\nfollowed by the collapse of the dot.com companies and\r\nthe massive cheating by the huge multinational\r\ncorporations of the rich. Then came the 11 September\r\n2001 attack by terrorists, which precipitated an\r\nunprecedented tightening of security worldwide and the\r\ninvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. The world now lives\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nin fear — the rich of terror attacks and the others of\r\nbeing made targets of suspicion and pre-emptive\r\naggression.\r\nThen came severe acute respiratory syndrome\r\n(SARS), which almost bankrupted many airlines and\r\nthe tour and travel business. SARS disappeared almost\r\nas quickly as it appeared, but there is no guarantee that it\r\nor similar new infectious diseases will not come back.\r\nThe world has lost its way. The hopes of the post-\r\nSecond-World-War period and the United Nations were\r\ndashed by the cold war. The cold war is over now, but\r\nthe resultant unipolar world and the ascendancy of\r\ncapitalism have brought about new threats. No country\r\nis safe from marauding currency traders who, in a few\r\nshort days, can demolish the patiently nurtured\r\neconomies of the developing world. Far from being\r\ncurbed, these highway brigands are lauded for their\r\nphilanthropy. Robin Hood at least stole from the rich to\r\ngive to the poor. These highwaymen steal from the\r\npoor and give a paltry sum to assuage their sense of\r\nguilt. They are no philanthropists.\r\nThe unipolar world dominated by a democratic\r\nnation is leading the world into economic chaos,\r\npolitical anarchy, uncertainty and fear. We are not\r\ngoing to recover or have peace so long as threats are\r\nused for political and economic reforms that most of\r\nthe world is not ready for or willing to accept.\r\nIf we want to have democracy, the rule of law and\r\nrespect for human rights, the powerful must\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to all these noble ideas.\r\nAnd they can begin by restructuring the United\r\nNations, in particular by abolishing the undemocratic\r\nsingle-country veto. This should be replaced with a\r\nmodified veto whereby two veto powers, backed by\r\nthree other members of the Security Council, would be\r\nneeded to block any United Nations resolution. Even\r\nthat, however, should be gradually dismantled in\r\nfavour of majority decisions in the Security Council.\r\nThe other important agencies of the United\r\nNations must be freed from the domination of any\r\nsingle country. Gradually, they should be made more\r\ndemocratic.\r\nThe free market must be recognized for what it is\r\n— a market in which the bottom line is paramount. It is\r\nnot a political force for the disciplining of\r\nGovernments. For the right to exploit world trade, a tax\r\nshould be levied by the United Nations and used by the\r\nUnited Nations to build needed infrastructure for the\r\npoor countries of the world. Exchange rates should be\r\nfixed by an international commission based on relevant\r\nissues. Apart from a small commission, no profits may\r\nbe made by speculating or manipulating exchange\r\nrates. Subsidies by rich countries for the production of\r\nfood and other products must be forbidden, although\r\npoor countries should be allowed for a stipulated time\r\nto protect their industries and food production.\r\nThe world has lost its way. The world is moving\r\ntoo fast. We need to pause to take stock of things.\r\nThere is a Malaysian saying that when one loses his\r\nway he should go back to the beginning. We need to go\r\nback to the beginning. If we dare to admit it, many of\r\nthe problems that we face today are due to the arbitrary\r\nexpropriation of the land of the Palestinians in order to\r\ncreate the State of Israel in order to solve the European\r\nJewish problem.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of\r\nMalaysia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Dato’ Seri Mahathir Mohamad, Prime Minister\r\nof Malaysia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Patrick Leclercq, Minister of\r\nState, Chief of the Government and Director of\r\nExternal Relations of the Principality of Monaco\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Minister of State, Chief of the\r\nGovernment and Director of External Relations of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco.\r\nMr. Patrick Leclercq, Minister of State, Chief of\r\nthe Government and Director of External\r\nRelations of the Principality of Monaco, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency the Minister of State, Chief\r\nof the Government and Director of External Relations\r\nof the Principality of Monaco, Mr. Patrick Leclercq,\r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Leclercq (Monaco) (spoke in French): Let\r\nme first congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Your election is welcome testimony of the\r\nequal sovereignty of States, a principle to which the\r\ndelegation of the Principality of Monaco attaches\r\nparticular importance. I assure you and the members of\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nthe Bureau of our support for your high mission at the\r\nservice of the international community.\r\nI also wish to congratulate the Secretary-General:\r\nall are aware of his tireless efforts to promote with\r\ncourage and lucidity the ideals our Organization\r\nembodies as it faces the challenges of our time. The\r\ntragic circumstances surrounding the heinous attack\r\nperpetrated in Baghdad last month call for us to pay\r\nspecial tribute to all United Nations personnel and\r\nsalute with respect and sorrow the memory of those,\r\nincluding Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his\r\ncompanions, who by sacrificing their lives, have\r\ndemonstrated the strength and grandeur of commitment\r\nto the values that only our Organization can\r\nlegitimately embody.\r\nWhen it joined the United Nations ten years ago,\r\nthe Principality of Monaco pledged to fully abide by\r\nthe obligations incumbent on all Member States and to\r\nparticipate, according to our means, in the promotion\r\nof the values that bring us together. We are all the more\r\nattached to that commitment because it is particularly\r\nimportant for small States such as Monaco that all are\r\nbound by the same rules in their international conduct\r\nand that all enjoy equal dignity and the equal right to\r\nrespect.\r\nOf course, there is a considerable and at times\r\nglaring divergence between the ambitions we collectively\r\nespouse and the actual situations we observe around us,\r\nwhich unfortunately afflict so many among us.\r\nAssuredly, it would be pointless to ignore the profound\r\ndifferences that may exist between States in terms of\r\nboth their characteristics and their influence in\r\ninternational affairs. But it is essential that we have a\r\nplace, a forum in which we are all compelled to judge our\r\nactions and conduct by the principles that are supposed to\r\nguide our actions and in which we are compelled to\r\nexamine our conscience — in short, a place where we, as\r\nmembers of the international community, are held\r\naccountable to the collective demands of that community.\r\nThat is why it is so important that we strive to\r\nmake the Organization more effective so that respect\r\nfor our principles and purposes prevails over the\r\nseeming ease of self-justification and so that a\r\ncollective approach based on dialogue prevails over\r\nunilateral action. As a question of principle and as a\r\nresult of reasoning, the Principality of Monaco\r\ntherefore supports all initiatives aimed at strengthening\r\nour collective mechanisms, in particular those\r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General pursuant to the\r\nMillennium Declaration as presented at the opening of\r\nthe present session.\r\nAccordingly, the Principality of Monaco attaches\r\nparticular importance to the effective implementation\r\nof the General Assembly resolution on the follow-up to\r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences and\r\nsummits in the economic and social fields. Indeed,\r\nwhat purpose would be served by these enormous\r\ngatherings in which all participants vie to demonstrate\r\ntheir magnanimity and generosity if the resulting\r\ncommitments are not followed up on or lack the means\r\nto monitor their implementation? The authority of the\r\nUnited Nations and the confidence placed in it would\r\nbe diminished, even as the Organization has\r\nconsiderably expanded the range of its activities in\r\norder to effectively tackle the problems of our time,\r\nacting from the global perspective of its own ongoing\r\nresponsibility to ensure peace, security and\r\ndevelopment. Would civil society, which today is\r\npresent in all the debates that involve it, not feel\r\nfrustrated and seek to take the lead on its own terms,\r\ncreating an environment of confrontation?\r\nWhile participating in the many activities pursued\r\nwithin the Organization, a small country such as the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco must reasonably assess the size\r\nof the contribution it is able to make to the action of\r\nthe international community. Thus, we have focused\r\nour efforts in the areas of sustainable development and\r\nhumanitarian action because we feel that our acquired\r\nexperience enables us, despite our human and material\r\nlimitations, to make a useful contribution since we can\r\ncount on very dynamic Monegasque non-governmental\r\norganizations, which benefit from particularly generous\r\nlocal support. I am happy to convey our appreciation to\r\nthose organizations.\r\nMonaco’s priority areas are education, health, the\r\nprotection of children, development assistance and\r\nenvironmental protection. Its activities have resulted in\r\nnumerous achievements in the field, particularly in\r\nAfrica, where our aid has doubled following the\r\nadoption of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. Monaco has also achieved much in the\r\nMediterranean region. All Monaco’s initiatives are\r\ncomplemented by our active participation in the forums\r\nwhere those various situations are addressed.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco focuses on concrete\r\nprojects such as schools, occupational training centres,\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nhealthcare centres, investments in local communities to\r\npromote economic activity in village communities\r\nthrough micro-credit programmes. All those projects\r\nare aimed at directly improving the living conditions of\r\ntheir beneficiaries.\r\nIn the area of the environment, in which the\r\nPrincipality has long distinguished itself, especially in\r\nthe protection of the marine environment since one of\r\nMonaco’s sovereigns, Prince Albert I, helped found the\r\nstudy of oceanography in the late nineteenth century.\r\nOur experience has led to us being chosen to\r\nparticipate in the next Governing Council of the United\r\nNations Environment Programme. The Principality of\r\nMonaco has also been the source of many initiatives\r\nrelated both to protecting its immediate environment,\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea, and to monitoring pollution and\r\npreserving biodiversity elsewhere, with a long-term\r\nperspective of support for sustainable development.\r\nResolutely committed to participating in the\r\nefforts of the international community to rise to the\r\nmost recent challenges with which it has been\r\nconfronted, Monaco has ratified the twelve main\r\ninternational instruments relating to terrorism, putting\r\ninto place appropriate administrative structures.\r\nFurthermore, it is the first State to ratify the United\r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized\r\nCrime, which will enter into force in the next few days,\r\non 29 September. It is also preparing to host, next\r\nmonth, the Fifth International Summit on Transnational\r\nCrime, organized by the United Nations and the\r\nCouncil of Europe, which will bring together\r\nrepresentatives of Governments and the private sector.\r\nIn the same spirit, the Principality works with all the\r\nrelevant institutions to fight drugs and human\r\ntrafficking and the illegal financial flows they engender\r\nor sustain.\r\nNeed I also reaffirm the obvious commitment to\r\npeace and security of a country as sensitive to its\r\nenvironment as Monaco, even if, having no armed\r\nforces, it is unable to participate in collective actions\r\nunder the flag of the United Nations? It is in the\r\nhumanitarian field that Monaco consistently makes its\r\ncontribution by assisting civilian populations, victims\r\nof combat and the upheavals and atrocities that too\r\noften today characterize armed conflicts, as can be seen\r\nparticularly in Africa. In a symbolic solidarity, the\r\nPrincipality celebrates the International Day of Peace\r\non 21 September and associates itself with the Olympic\r\nTruce, given Monaco’s involvement in the Olympic\r\nmovement as symbolized in the long-standing\r\nparticipation of Crown Prince Albert in the International\r\nOlympic Committee. We thus welcome the inclusion of a\r\nnew item on the agenda of this session, entitled\r\n“International Year of Sport and Physical Education”,\r\nwhose goal is to highlight what has always been our\r\nmotivation, the outstanding role of sport in developing\r\nrelations between peoples by promoting mutual\r\nunderstanding and intercultural dialogue, factors that\r\ncontribute to both peace and development.\r\nAs I conclude this statement, I hope I have\r\nsucceeded in communicating the profound attachment of\r\nthe Principality of Monaco to the world Organization that\r\nit joined 10 years ago at His Serene Highness Prince\r\nRainier III’s initiative. He was convinced that his\r\ncountry would thereby gain a most effective\r\ninternational profile, protection in an uncertain world\r\nand an opportunity to usefully demonstrate its\r\nsolidarity. Since Monaco is naturally open to the\r\noutside world, it has easily found its place among you.\r\nOur Principality is grateful for what the United\r\nNations has given it and is striving in return and to the\r\nextent of its capacity to help the Organization achieve\r\nits objectives with the conviction that what the\r\ninternational community needs are reliable Member\r\nStates. And reliability is not a question of size but of\r\nwill. It is this will that inspires and guides us.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Minister of State, Chief of the\r\nGovernment and Director of External Relations of the\r\nPrincipality of Monaco for the statement he just made.\r\nMr. Patrick Leclercq, Minister of State, Chief of\r\nthe Government and Director of External\r\nRelations of the Principality of Monaco, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of India\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear a statement\r\nby the Prime Minister of the Republic of India.\r\nMr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of India, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of India, and in inviting\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nMr. Vajpayee (India) (spoke in Hindi; English\r\ntext provided by the delegation): Mr. President, we\r\ncongratulate you on your election to the presidency of\r\nthe fifty-eighth session of the United Nations General\r\nAssembly. We wish you every success in our shared\r\nendeavours. You will have our fullest cooperation in\r\nyour efforts.\r\nAs we gather here, in the wake of the many\r\nmomentous events over the past year, it is inevitable\r\nthat we should ponder some fundamental questions\r\nabout the role and relevance of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations was charged by its Charter\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge of\r\nwar.” The Charter also speaks of our collective\r\ndetermination “to unite our strength to maintain\r\ninternational peace and security.” There was an implicit\r\nconviction that the United Nations would be stronger\r\nthan the sum of its constituent Member States. Its\r\nunique legitimacy flows from a universal perception\r\nthat it pursues a larger purpose than the interests of one\r\ncountry or a small group of countries.\r\nThis vision of an enlightened multilateralism has\r\nnot materialized. There have been difficulties and\r\ndeficiencies in ensuring a world free from strife, a world\r\nwithout war. The United Nations has not always been\r\nsuccessful in preventing conflicts or in resolving them.\r\nDuring the past year, the United Nations\r\nencountered new challenges. We saw the extraordinary\r\ninability of the five permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil to agree on action in respect of Iraq, in spite of\r\ncomplete agreement on basic objectives. Most recently,\r\nthe brutal terrorist attack on the United Nations Office\r\nin Baghdad struck a body blow at the United Nations’\r\nhumanitarian efforts there.\r\nLooking back at events over recent years, we can\r\nanalyse the successes and failures of the United\r\nNations in this or that crisis. But it would be more\r\npurposeful to reflect on our own commitment to\r\nmultilateralism, the extent of its applicability in the\r\nreal world of today, and the manner in which it can be\r\nexercised through the United Nations. The reality is\r\nthat an international institution like the United Nations\r\ncan only be as effective as its Members allow it to be.\r\nOur reflections on the United Nations should\r\nfocus on three key aspects:\r\nFirst, we need to introspect on some of the\r\nassumptions that have been made over the years\r\nconcerning the will and reach of the United Nations. In\r\nthe euphoria after the Cold War, there was a misplaced\r\nnotion that the United Nations could solve every\r\nproblem anywhere. Its enthusiasm and proactive stance\r\non many issues reflected laudable intentions. But we\r\nsoon realized that the United Nations does not possess\r\nmagical powers to solve every crisis in all parts of the\r\nglobe or to change overnight the motivation of leaders\r\nand communities around the world. //We need to\r\nclearly recognize, with a sense of realism, the limits to\r\nwhat the United Nations can achieve, and the changes\r\nof form and function required for it to play an optimal\r\nrole in today’s world. We need to clearly recognize,\r\nwith a sense of realism, the limits to what the United\r\nNations can achieve, and the changes that it needs to\r\nmake to its form and function to play an optimal role in\r\ntoday’s world.\r\nSecondly, the Iraq issue has inevitably generated\r\na debate on the functioning and the efficacy of the\r\nSecurity Council and of the United Nations itself. Over\r\nthe decades, the United Nations membership has grown\r\nenormously. The scope of its activities has expanded\r\ngreatly, with new specialized agencies and new\r\nprogrammes. But in the political and security\r\ndimensions of its activities, the United Nations has not\r\nkept pace with the changes in the world. For the\r\nSecurity Council to represent genuine multilateralism\r\nin its decisions and actions, its membership must\r\nreflect current world realities. Most United Nations\r\nMembers today recognize the need for an enlarged and\r\nrestructured Security Council, with more developing\r\ncountries as permanent and non-permanent members.\r\nThe permanent members guard their exclusivity. Some\r\nStates with weak claims want to ensure that others do\r\nnot enter the Council as permanent members. This\r\ncombination of complacency and negativism has to be\r\ncountered with a strong political will. The recent crises\r\nshould serve as a warning to us that until the Security\r\nCouncil is reformed and restructured, its decisions\r\ncannot truly reflect the collective will of the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nThirdly, even after such reform, the Security\r\nCouncil would have to develop suitable decision-\r\nmaking mechanisms that ensure better representation of\r\nthe collective will of the international community. How\r\ncan multilateralism be genuinely implemented? A\r\nsingle veto is an anachronism in today’s world. On the\r\nother hand, the requirement of unanimity can sabotage\r\nimperative actions. A simple-majority vote may not be\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nsufficiently representative for major and serious issues.\r\nShould we aim for the highest common factor, or\r\nshould we settle for the lowest common denominator?\r\nDemocratic countries could use their national\r\nexperience to provide feasible models for mechanisms\r\nand determine the extent of support required based on\r\nthe impact of action to be taken.\r\nThe Secretary-General has rightly emphasized the\r\nurgent need for reform of the institutions and processes\r\nof the United Nations. We encourage his efforts in this\r\ndirection. We should seek to implement these reforms\r\nwithin a specified time frame.\r\nThe Iraq issue continues to present a major\r\nchallenge to the United Nations. At this point in time,\r\nit is not very productive to linger on the past. Our\r\nthoughts and concerns should be about the suffering of\r\nthe people of Iraq. It is imperative that the people of\r\nIraq should be empowered to determine their own\r\nfuture and to rebuild their nation.\r\nThe immediate priorities are ensuring security\r\nand stability, restoration of basic facilities and\r\ninfrastructure and a road map of political processes for\r\na representative Iraqi Government. It is clear that the\r\nUnited Nations has a crucial role to play in the process\r\nof political and economic reconstruction of that\r\ncountry. This has been acknowledged both by those\r\nwho had opposed military action and by those who did\r\nnot seek specific United Nations endorsement for it.\r\nOne issue on which the United Nations showed\r\nremarkable unanimity after 11 September was global\r\nterrorism. Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001)\r\nand 1456 (2003) were unequivocal in condemning all\r\nforms of terrorism and in calling for united action\r\nagainst support, shelter, sponsorship, arming, training\r\nand financing of terrorism or terrorists.\r\nUnfortunately, the solidarity that was voiced has\r\nnot translated into coherent and effective action.\r\nTerrorist acts continue to shatter our peace, from\r\nMombasa to Moscow and from Baghdad to Bali. India\r\nhas had more than its share of terrorism in various\r\nparts of the country. The global coalition against\r\nterrorism has registered successes in Afghanistan, but\r\nhas not been able to extend this elsewhere. Some of its\r\nmembers are themselves part of the problem. We are\r\nsometimes led to enter into semantic arguments over\r\nthe definition of terrorism. The search for root causes\r\nor imaginary freedom struggles provides alibis for\r\nkilling innocent men, women and children.\r\nThere is much that the United Nations can do to\r\ncarry forward the war against international terrorism.\r\nThe Counter-Terrorism Committee should develop\r\nmeasures to ensure compliance by Member States of\r\ntheir obligations under Security Council resolutions\r\n1373 (2001) and 1456 (2003). We should have credible\r\nmultilateral instruments to identify States that\r\ncontravene these resolutions. Multilateral mechanisms\r\nmust be created to detect and choke off international\r\nfinancial flows to terrorists and terrorist organizations.\r\nA much better international system of\r\ninformation exchange and intelligence sharing needs to\r\nbe devised to prevent terrorists from evading capture\r\nsimply by crossing national borders. No State should\r\nbe allowed to profess partnership with the global\r\ncoalition against terror, while continuing to aid, abet\r\nand sponsor terrorism. To condone such double\r\nstandards is to contribute to multiplying terrorism.\r\nYesterday, the President of Pakistan chose this\r\naugust Assembly to make a public admission for the\r\nfirst time that Pakistan is sponsoring terrorism in\r\nJammu and Kashmir. After claiming that there is an\r\nindigenous struggle in Kashmir, he has offered to\r\nencourage a general cessation of violence within Kashmir,\r\nin return for reciprocal obligations and restraints.\r\nWe totally refuse to let terrorism become a tool of\r\nblackmail. Just as the world did not negotiate with al\r\nQaeda or the Taliban, we shall not negotiate with\r\nterrorism. Were we to do so, we would be betraying the\r\npeople of Jammu and Kashmir, who defied a most\r\nferocious campaign of violence and intimidation\r\nsponsored from across our borders and participated in\r\nan election, which has been universally hailed as free\r\nand fair. This was an unequivocal expression of both\r\ndetermination and self-determination.\r\nWhen the cross-border terrorism stops, or when\r\nwe eradicate it, we can have a dialogue with Pakistan\r\non the other issues between us.\r\nWhile on this subject, I would also like to point\r\nout to the President of Pakistan that he should not\r\nconfuse the legitimate aspiration for equality of nations\r\nwith outmoded concepts of military parity.\r\nWe should be particularly concerned at the\r\nvarious recent revelations about clandestine transfers of\r\nweapons of mass destruction and their technologies.\r\nWe face the frightening prospect of these weapons and\r\ntechnologies falling into the hands of terrorists. Surely\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nsomething needs to be done about the helplessness of\r\ninternational regimes in preventing such transactions,\r\nwhich clearly threaten international security. The same\r\nregimes expend considerable energy in imposing a\r\nvariety of discriminatory technology-denial restrictions\r\non responsible States.\r\nOur preoccupation with terrorism should not\r\ndilute our commitment to tackle the non-military\r\nthreats to human and international security. We have to\r\nsustain the fight against trafficking in narcotic drugs,\r\nhuman beings and small arms, the pandemic of\r\nHIV/AIDS, diseases like malaria and tuberculosis that\r\nbeset developing countries and the degradation of our\r\ncommon environment. Food security, energy security\r\nand health security are important goals.\r\nThe countries of the North and of the South —\r\nthe developed, developing and transition economies —\r\nmust resume their dialogue to build a better world for\r\nthe present and future generations. For the agenda of\r\nglobalization, Cancún was a disappointment.\r\nSignificant progress was made at Johannesburg\r\ntowards the realization of sustainable development, but\r\nthe entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol on climate\r\nchange remains stalled and the Convention on\r\nBiological Diversity has not yielded any tangible\r\nbenefits to the world’s poor.\r\nInternational economic relations continue to be\r\ncharacterized by inequities and inequalities.\r\nGlobalization has helped sections of the international\r\neconomy, including some developing countries; however,\r\nlarge communities have been left outside its pale. It has\r\nengendered economic crises and instability in several\r\ndeveloping countries and sharply increased poverty.\r\nPoverty is multidimensional. It extends beyond\r\nmoney and income to education, health care, skills\r\nenhancement, political participation at all levels from\r\nthe local to the global, access to natural resources,\r\nclean water and air, and advancement of one’s own\r\nculture and social organization.\r\nPoverty alleviation requires resources on a far\r\ngreater scale than now available. Globalization itself\r\nplaces constraints on Governments of developing\r\ncountries in raising public resources for poverty\r\nalleviation. The promise of the climate change and\r\nbiodiversity treaties to raise significant resources for\r\ninvestment and technology transfer is as yet unrealized.\r\nThe resources of multilateral and bilateral development\r\nagencies are limited by the failure of industrialized\r\ncountries to enhance development budgets.\r\nTherefore, if the current regimes of globalization\r\nand sustainable development are to be expanded — or\r\neven to survive — they must be directly harnessed to\r\nprovide the necessary resources for poverty alleviation.\r\nIn fact, all international agreements and initiatives\r\naffecting developing countries have to be evaluated by\r\ntheir impact on poverty.\r\nDeveloping countries need to coordinate their\r\npositions in international negotiations to promote the\r\nadoption of regimes which would help alleviate\r\npoverty. The India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue\r\nForum, which was established earlier this year, is an\r\neffort in this direction.\r\nWe in the developing countries do not have the\r\nluxury of time. Political compulsions force us to meet\r\nthe aspirations of our people quickly, even as we\r\nsubject ourselves to newer and more rigid international\r\nstandards and norms. We owe it to our future generations\r\nto make strong efforts to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. There is a mutuality of interest in\r\nthis between the developed and the developing\r\ncountries. Global interdependence today means that\r\neconomic disasters in developing countries could\r\ncreate a backlash in developed countries. We hope the\r\nworld will act in this spirit of enlightened self-interest.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of India for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of India, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Marc Forné\r\nMolné, Prime Minister of the Principality of\r\nAndorra\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Principality of\r\nAndorra.\r\nMr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency, Mr. Marc Forné Molné, the\r\nPrime Minister of the Principality of Andorra, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nMr. Forné Molné (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): During the\r\npast two years, the attacks of 11 September 2001 and\r\nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in Africa,\r\nhave brought turmoil to the world.\r\nThe United Nations has never been more\r\nnecessary, yet perhaps never has its efficacy been so\r\nquestioned nor, until the bombings last month in\r\nBaghdad, have its people been the object of such\r\nmassive direct attack.\r\nIn the Principality of Andorra, encircled by the\r\nhigh mountains of the Pyrenees, we have lived\r\npeacefully and democratically between our neighbours\r\nfor over 700 years. Since 1419, our Parliament has met\r\nto debate the problems of our people. It was not only\r\nour small size and isolation that kept us apart from the\r\nwars that ravaged Europe; rather, our desire for\r\nindependence, the unity of our people, and also our ability\r\nto get along with our powerful neighbours made Andorra\r\none of the oldest democratic States in the world.\r\nIn the past half-century, since the founding of the\r\nUnited Nations, the world has changed, and Andorra\r\nwith it. Less than a century ago it was only possible to\r\nreach Andorra by horse. Now roads bring us 12 million\r\ntourists each year. Telephones, computers, satellites\r\nand airplanes bring the world to Andorra and we in\r\nturn have reached out to the world. In the time of my\r\ngrandparents, Andorrans never travelled far from their\r\nmountains. Now we are world travellers.\r\nOne of the proud moments in the long history of\r\nour country was the day in 1993 — ten years ago —\r\nwhen we became a Member State of the United\r\nNations. We joined with great hopes and all these years\r\nwe have believed in its crucial role, despite the crises\r\nthat may have cooled that belief.\r\nThe terrorist attack on the United States of\r\nAmerica marked the beginning of a very complex stage\r\nin relations among nations and of a difficult\r\nequilibrium among different areas of our planet. The\r\ninvasions of Afghanistan and Iraq were both set in\r\nmotion by this attack; one had the support of the\r\nUnited Nations while the other did not. While there is\r\nno point in returning to that debate, two questions must\r\nbe addressed.\r\nFirst, can the United Nations effectively respond\r\nto threats to world stability? Secondly, to what degree\r\nwill its Member States be willing to work within the\r\nframework of the United Nations? Perhaps a cooling of\r\npassions will enable us to address these difficult issues\r\nclearly.\r\nWe are all too aware of the difficulties and\r\ndangers that beset both the citizens of these countries\r\nand the troops of Member States who are working to\r\nbring stability to these places. We hope for a rapid\r\nsolution to the myriad difficulties involved in ending\r\nthe series of sad and painful events that have taken\r\nplace within these countries over the past few years.\r\nThe United Nations has a critical responsibility in\r\nfostering a constructive outcome for the Afghan and\r\nIraqi people and also in resolving tension throughout\r\nthe Middle East. In this regard I wish to express our\r\nconfidence in the United Nations to bring an end to this\r\ncomplex and cruel conflict, a crucial step for the\r\nstability of the region and an important matter for the\r\nfuture of mankind. The United Nations will know how\r\nto find new ways and adequate solutions and will play\r\na leading role in the establishment of new paths.\r\nAs politicians, we pride ourselves on our\r\nknowledge of the needs of our citizens. We are students\r\nat the university of the national will. The most\r\nsuccessful among us have cultivated a keen sense of\r\nthe everyday desires, frustrations, and goals that are\r\nimportant to our citizens. If we live in a democratic\r\nState, and ignore those needs, the voters will quickly\r\nlook for others who do not.\r\nThe United Nations is a different kind of\r\nuniversity. Here the lessons of national self-interest\r\nmust give way to an international understanding. In\r\nthis university of the world, our previous studies, by\r\nwhich I mean our own political careers, can only help\r\nus in the short term. But what we study together here\r\nare long-term lessons that can ensure the long-term\r\nsurvival of the world we share.\r\nAlthough Andorra is small in scale, like many\r\npartners in the United Nations, what we smaller nations\r\nhave to contribute is larger than our proportionate\r\ngeographic scale or the relative size of our population.\r\nIndeed, our small size has made us by necessity careful\r\nobservers of the needs of others and our centuries of\r\nindependence have taught us responsibility to our citizens\r\nand our neighbours. We have never forgotten the bonds\r\nthat link us to the world. Our history has taught us this.\r\nLegend has it that Andorra was founded by\r\nCharlemagne, who, let us recall, was one of the key\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nhistorical players in the battles between Islam and\r\nChristianity. In the thirteenth century, however, it was\r\nthe religious tension between the Count of Foix, who\r\nwas a Cathar sympathizer, and the Catholic bishop of\r\nUrgell that led to a balanced agreement resulting in the\r\nindependence of Andorra. Andorra came into existence\r\npartly as a buffer State between two powerful lords and\r\nbetween two approaches to Christianity: the orthodox\r\nand the Cathar.\r\nThe Cathars are only a distant memory now, but I\r\nraise this issue here because it points to the\r\nbattleground of belief. Whereas the Church once\r\nsummoned councils to struggle over the problems of\r\nheresy, we now gather at the United Nations not to\r\ninsist on one form of belief, but to recognize and\r\nsustain the common ethical base that unites all beliefs,\r\nall ideologies, under the unshakeable canopy of the\r\n1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nMr. Alimov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, took the\r\nChair.\r\nWe are now in the twenty-first century and not in\r\nthe Middle Ages, but those who then were\r\nfundamentalist Christians and who resolved everything\r\nwith anathemas, crusades and exiles have given place\r\nto those who practice other forms of religious\r\nintolerance of different persuasions. It is shameful to\r\nsee that, even today, people are being killed or kill in\r\nthe name of their God.\r\nThe work that the United Nations accomplishes,\r\ntherefore, does not simply pay lip service to diversity.\r\nWe need to advance, in all moral seriousness, an ethic\r\nof diversity that goes beyond recognizing the value of\r\ntolerance and multiculturalism and strives to\r\nimplement shared ethical values in the service of world\r\nunderstanding.\r\nIn 1278, the strategic importance of Andorra lay\r\nin its proximity to the border between Catholic Europe\r\nand al-Andalus, Islamic Spain. The road that led to the\r\ngreat city of Cordoba — where the philosophy of\r\nAristotle was retranslated from Greek and Arabic into\r\nLatin and re-entered the thought of the Christian West\r\nin the renaissance of the twelfth century — passed\r\nclose by our country.\r\nIn the centre of that city, the Muslim rulers built\r\nan astonishing mosque with a forest of columns, made\r\nall the more beautiful by the presence within it of a\r\nsynagogue. Such was its beauty that it was not destroyed\r\nwhen the Christians captured the city, but converted into a\r\nCathedral, just as the great basilicas of Constantinople\r\nbecame the great mosques of Istanbul when that city\r\nfell to the Ottoman empire a century later.\r\nWhat if we could learn from the events that have\r\nmarked history, making use of the lessons of peaceful\r\ncoexistence, avoiding past mistakes and appreciating\r\nthe moments of openness between cultures in previous\r\ncenturies?\r\nWe live in a world of vast contrasts where\r\ntechnological progress, used dangerously or simply\r\nwithout precaution, has made life more perilous on a\r\nglobal scale. Where once the great plague took years to\r\nmake its way across Europe, modern plagues — be\r\nthey biological viruses or computer viruses — travel\r\nacross the globe in a matter of hours.\r\nPollution and global warming concern us all. The\r\nstrange climactic shifts of recent years, the pollution of\r\nour great oceans and lakes, threaten our environment.\r\nPerhaps most dangerously, nuclear weapons threaten\r\nthe life of everyone on the planet. All of these\r\ncalamities, present or looming, demand international\r\ncooperation if we are to survive.\r\nIt is most sad that some of those who could do\r\nmost to prevent the degradation of life on Earth\r\ncontinue to look in another direction — at the balance\r\nsheets of the big companies that contaminate the Earth\r\nmost egregiously — and continue to apply an energy\r\npolicy based on the uncontrolled exploitation and low\r\ncost of limited resources.\r\nWe have become a little world. We have become\r\nlike a small country, rather like Andorra, where\r\neverybody knows everybody else’s business. As we\r\nbecome smaller, the need to combat poverty and\r\nsuffering has become all the more important. We\r\ncannot forget that images from more fortunate\r\ncountries are beamed into the lives of people existing\r\nin difficult or even life-threatening circumstances\r\nacross the world. No matter that these images may be\r\npropaganda and distortions of the truth — our modern\r\ntechnology, the source of so many comforts and\r\nadvantages, is also demonstrating the full scale of our\r\ndifferences.\r\nWe must learn to treat all members of the world\r\nas we would like to see our own citizens treated. We\r\nneed to insist on a decent life for everyone, for all\r\nmankind.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nAndorra is committed to aiding development\r\naround the world. Since 1995, we have regularly\r\nincreased our budgetary contributions and hope to\r\ndevote 0.7 per cent of our budget to third-world aid\r\nwithin two years. Our philosophy of development\r\nsupports the institutions of the United Nations, looking\r\nto small-scale solutions that foster self-reliance and\r\nlocal initiative. We are particularly enthusiastic about\r\nprojects aimed at children, education and those who\r\nhelp women to establish their own businesses. We are\r\nalso committed to encouraging sustainable farming\r\nbecause we recognize that proper farming practices\r\nprovide the best defence against catastrophic crop\r\nfailures. To that end, Andorra also proposes within the\r\nnext year to become a member of the Food and\r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations.\r\nThe insignificant part of the Andorran budget\r\ndevoted to the purchase of weapons resulted in the\r\ncomposer and singer Pete Seeger dedicating a song to\r\nus in the 1960s. His verses still echo today, just as they\r\ndid when he made a whole generation sing “We shall\r\novercome. We shall live in peace”. Many things have\r\nhappened since those days and Andorra no longer\r\nallocates so much as $4.50 towards its defence budget.\r\nWe do not spend a penny.\r\nIn this diverse and contradictory world, with all\r\nthat is squandered on new weapons and old, the whole\r\nof mankind could live decently. We could eliminate all\r\ndiseases. Education and culture would be made\r\navailable to all. Thus, we could end fanaticism and all\r\nthose who abuse the ignorance of the people would end\r\nup without victims or lackeys.\r\nLet us try and make some use of these long\r\ndebates and speeches which we applaud with\r\ndiplomatic courtesy, often without even hearing them.\r\nToo much is at stake for all of us.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I thank the Prime Minister of the Principality\r\nof Andorra for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Marc Forné Molné, Prime Minister of the\r\nPrincipality of Andorra, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bertie Ahern, Prime Minister of\r\nIreland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of Ireland.\r\nMr. Bertie Ahern, Prime Minister of Ireland, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister of Ireland, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Bertie Ahern. I invite him to address\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ahern (Ireland): For the United Nations and\r\nthe system of collective security that it represents, the\r\npast year has been a traumatic one.\r\nOur Organization could ill afford the loss of the\r\ndedicated and experienced members of staff who were\r\nkilled by an act of terrorism in Baghdad on the 19\r\nAugust. I do not diminish the contribution of each and\r\nevery one of those who lost their lives in the cause of\r\nhumanity if I give individual mention to Sergio Vieira\r\nde Mello. I would like to pay particular tribute to his\r\nwork in bringing to birth the new State of Timor Leste,\r\nwhich has become the latest Member of the United\r\nNations.\r\nWe are living in a period of great insecurity. We\r\nare stalked by fear — fear of war, terrorism, weapons\r\nof mass destruction, famine, disease, ethnic and\r\nreligious hatred, and organized crime. Governments are\r\nacting, individually and in groups, to shield their\r\npeople from these threats. However, the nature of the\r\nchallenge requires coordinated global action.\r\nFortunately, we have the United Nations\r\nOrganization, which brings together the nations of the\r\nworld in the service of international peace and security.\r\nIf we did not already have such an organization, we\r\nwould surely have to invent it. The tragedy for\r\nmankind is that we do not make the most effective use\r\nof it. We are frequently told by commentators that the\r\nUnited Nations has failed. All too often, it is difficult\r\nto disagree.\r\nSo, who is to blame? To answer that question we\r\nhave to ask: what is the United Nations? The answer is\r\nto be found in the Charter. This Organization was\r\nestablished in the name of the peoples of the United\r\nNations. When the United Nations fails, it is because\r\nwe, the Governments that represent the peoples of the\r\nUnited Nations, have failed, individually or\r\ncollectively, to meet our obligations.\r\nOur most common failing, I would submit, is that\r\nwe frequently overlook the fact that this Organization\r\nwas created to serve not just our own nation, but all\r\nmankind. Too often, Members seek to use this\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nOrganization to pursue their national interests by\r\nseeking to have it adopt resolutions that are partial or\r\nbiased; by ignoring its resolutions when these do not\r\nsuit them; and by encouraging action on certain issues\r\nand conflicts while blocking action on or even\r\nconsideration of, others. All too many of us have been\r\nguilty of such an approach.\r\nWe simply cannot afford to continue with this\r\nattitude. The world is fast changing. Every day brings a\r\nnew awareness of just how interdependent we all are.\r\nThe option of shutting ourselves safely away behind\r\nprotective walls no longer exists. We have to learn to\r\nlive together, to share the resources of this planet and\r\nto look after each other. We can retain our national,\r\ncultural and religious identities, but we need to\r\nrecognize that we are, first and foremost, all members\r\nof the human race, and we must act accordingly.\r\nWe need a viable system of global governance\r\nthat can ensure international peace and security. To be\r\nviable, such a system must possess two essential\r\nqualities: effectiveness and legitimacy. To be effective,\r\nit requires the unambiguous support of the entire\r\ncommunity of nation States. Its decisions must be\r\nrespected and, where necessary, we must be ready and\r\nable to act to secure such respect. To retain legitimacy,\r\nthe system must be seen to work in the interests of the\r\nentire international community.\r\nI appeal, therefore, to the Governments\r\nrepresented at this session of the General Assembly for\r\na change in our attitude to the United Nations. Let us\r\ncease treating it as a tool useful only to the extent that\r\nit can deliver on our national agenda. Instead, let us use\r\nthe United Nations to harness our collective resources\r\nin the interests of each and every member of mankind.\r\nTo adapt the words of President John F. Kennedy, let us\r\nask not what the United Nations can do for us, but what\r\nwe can do for the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations needs reform. We all accept\r\nthat. Our institutions are not sufficiently effective and,\r\nin some instances, are not adequately representative of\r\ntoday’s membership. We have discussed these issues at\r\ngreat length, but we have balked at taking the hard\r\ndecisions. The time has come to put the interests of the\r\nwider international community before narrow national\r\nconcerns.\r\nWe are fortunate, at this moment, to have as\r\nSecretary-General a man of the stature of Kofi Annan;\r\na man who is held in universal regard and who is seen\r\nto stand for the interests of the entire international\r\ncommunity. He has not shrunk from grasping the nettle\r\nof reform, and in his address to this Assembly he called\r\non the Members of this Organization to grasp it with\r\nhim. We must find the courage and generosity to take\r\nup this challenge.\r\nThe past two years have been a particularly sober\r\nperiod in the history of mankind. There has been so\r\nmuch death and destruction across the globe. How\r\nmuch of this might have been avoided if the United\r\nNations had been better able to fulfil the noble\r\npurposes set out in the Charter?\r\nI do not claim that it is possible to eradicate\r\nman’s capacity for evil or to totally eliminate the\r\ntendency to seek to resolve disputes through violence.\r\nBut I do submit that a stronger, more resolute, more\r\nrespected and more active United Nations might have\r\nprevented some of the suffering of the past two years.\r\nThe world today is very different from that which\r\nexisted when the Charter was drawn up. It is smaller,\r\nmore crowded, more combustible. Isolated pockets of\r\nhuman habitation have been brought together by a\r\npopulation explosion, migration, faster and cheaper air\r\ntravel, television, the Internet, the growth of free trade\r\nand the development of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nWhat happens in one part of the world can increasingly\r\nhave an instant and dramatic effect in another part.\r\nThis evolution has raised questions concerning\r\nthe interpretation of two important provisions of the\r\nCharter. The first is paragraph 7 of Article 2, which in\r\neffect excludes the United Nations from intervening in\r\nmatters that are essentially within the domestic\r\njurisdiction of any State. Yet the problem arises\r\nincreasingly in our global society as to whether and\r\nwhen a matter can be considered as falling entirely\r\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of a State. Some\r\nsituations are clearer than others.\r\nIn my view, when events within a country\r\nthreaten international peace and security, they become\r\nthe legitimate interest of the international community.\r\nSimilarly, I cannot accept that the international\r\ncommunity should stand by and accept the large-scale,\r\nflagrant and persistent violation of human rights. We\r\nhave received sharp lessons in the past. The trigger for\r\nintervening to prevent an attempted genocide should\r\nnot be the moment that refugees begin to flood across\r\nthe border.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nAt the same time, international intervention raises\r\nserious questions. It can also pose serious risks to the\r\ninternational regime. Clearly, intervention is\r\nobjectively called for in some extreme cases. But there\r\nis a need to work carefully through this concept with a\r\nview to forging an international consensus around it.\r\nAnother issue that has recently come to the fore\r\nand was highlighted by the Secretary-General is that of\r\nArticle 51 of the Charter and the conditions under\r\nwhich Member States have the right to act in self-\r\ndefence. The development of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction in the period since the signing of the\r\nCharter, and the appearance of non-State actors with\r\nthe capacity for mass destruction, raise serious\r\nquestions as to the point at which a State might\r\nconsider it necessary to act in self-defence. This is also\r\nan issue that requires serious reflection.\r\nMy Government would be deeply concerned at\r\nthe widespread acceptance of a doctrine of pre-emptive\r\nstrike. Given the ever more lethal nature of modern\r\nweapons, the risk of large-scale death, destruction and\r\nescalation are enormous.\r\nMore effective than striking pre-emptively, of\r\ncourse, is to pre-empt the risk of conflict through a\r\nwide range of steps in the diplomatic, economic,\r\nhumanitarian and other areas.\r\nWe should devote more attention to dealing with\r\nthe root causes of conflict. We must seek to identify\r\npotential conflicts as early as possible and deal with\r\nthem before they get out of hand. Where conflict\r\nnevertheless becomes a possibility, we should act more\r\nassertively to head it off. We simply cannot afford to\r\naccept the existence of so-called forgotten or ignored\r\nconflicts. Any conflict that threatens international peace\r\nand security is the United Nations legitimate business and\r\nshould be on the agenda of the Security Council.\r\nI would now like to touch briefly on a number of\r\nspecific issues that are of concern to my Government.\r\nThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian\r\npeople continues to pose a serious threat to world\r\npeace. My own country’s difficult national experience\r\nshows that there is no such thing as a straight line to\r\npeace. Our experience in Ireland clearly demonstrates\r\nthat farsighted leaders cannot allow their efforts to be\r\nheld hostage by terrorists and extremists. They must\r\nhave the wisdom to look beyond the politics of the last\r\natrocity.\r\nWhat is more, leaders must be prepared to deal\r\nwith each other. As the Nobel Laureate John Hume\r\nonce said, “you make peace with your enemies, not\r\nyour friends”. President Arafat has a responsibility to\r\nlead his people away from violence and back to the\r\nnegotiating table. It is a responsibility that he must\r\nassume. Threats to expel or assassinate him are deeply\r\nmisguided and dangerous and can only further delay\r\nefforts to achieve a settlement.\r\nLasting peace can only be achieved through\r\nnegotiation. Palestinians must realize that violence has\r\nfailed. Terrorism is wrong and has brought nothing but\r\nmisery to both Israel and Palestine. It has made\r\ncompromise more difficult than ever.\r\nIsrael must see that repression and attempts at\r\nphysical separation will not deliver long-term security.\r\nThe most effective means for Israel to secure a\r\npeaceful future would be to accept the Palestinian\r\npeople’s right to a viable State of their own on the basis\r\nof the 1967 borders. Israel should immediately reverse\r\nits policy of building settlements, settler-only roads\r\nand a security wall on Palestinian territory.\r\nIt is imperative that the parties re-engage in the\r\ntask of implementing the road map, leading to a two-\r\nState solution based on the vision enshrined in Security\r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\r\n(2002). They need the support of the Quartet. But such\r\nmediation will not succeed if it is, or is perceived to be,\r\none-sided. We must be careful to ensure that our\r\ndemands are balanced and that we hold both sides\r\nequally to account.\r\nThe people of Iraq are suffering from events that\r\nin most cases are not of their making. We want to see\r\nthis suffering brought to an end as soon as possible.\r\nThe Iraqi people can only play a part in that by\r\nrejecting those who engage in violence and industrial\r\nsabotage. The occupying Powers must be scrupulous in\r\nmeeting their obligations under international law.\r\nThe Iraqi people need and deserve the support of\r\na united international community in the political and\r\neconomic reconstruction of their country. The United\r\nNations, with its unique experience and legitimacy, is\r\nessential to efforts to help the Iraqi people recover their\r\nsovereignty as soon as possible and to forge a new Iraq,\r\nat peace with itself and with its neighbours. We look to\r\nthe members of the Security Council at this crucial\r\nmoment to assume their responsibilities and to reach an\r\nagreement on a new resolution that reflects the interests\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nof the people of Iraq and that can enjoy the necessary\r\nsupport of the region and of the broad international\r\ncommunity.\r\nThe proliferation of nuclear, chemical and\r\nbiological weapons poses a serious threat to international\r\npeace and security. We must recommit ourselves to\r\ncontrolling the spread of such weapons, and working\r\ntowards their complete elimination. This can only be\r\nachieved through a comprehensive and rigorous system\r\nof international treaties and obligations that are\r\nverifiable and universal.\r\nIreland, with its partners in the New Agenda\r\nCoalition, will continue its efforts in respect of nuclear\r\ndisarmament during this year’s General Assembly.\r\nIreland calls on all States who are concerned about the\r\nissue of weapons of mass destruction to become\r\nconstructively engaged in the multilateral disarmament\r\nand non-proliferation process. There can be no room\r\nfor double standards.\r\nWe must also remain resolute in our\r\ndetermination to counter the threat of terrorism. We\r\nowe it to the victims of 11 September, and to the\r\nvictims of terrorist atrocities before and since then. The\r\nmeasures put in place by the Security Council have\r\nmade it more difficult for international terrorist\r\nnetworks to organize and to finance their activities.\r\nThese organizations, however, do not stand still. We\r\nmust remain vigilant and redouble our efforts to make\r\nit impossible for the agents of international terror to\r\noperate.\r\nIn doing so, however, we must be clear that the need\r\nto act against terrorism offers no license for action\r\ncontrary to the United Nations Charter, or against the\r\nbody of international human rights and humanitarian\r\nlaw that we have so painstakingly constructed.\r\nWe must also seek to deal with the causes of\r\nterrorism. Terrorism is not some kind of original sin.\r\nNo child is born a terrorist. At some point in their\r\nlives, some people become terrorists. We have to\r\nidentify how and why.\r\nAnd if we find that young people are being\r\nindoctrinated into terrorism, we have to deal with those\r\nwho seek to incite hatred and terror. If we find that\r\nthey act, however wrongly, in reaction to real or\r\nperceived injustice, we have to confront that fact and,\r\nas far as it is possible, seek to eliminate the reality or\r\nperception of that injustice. To seek to understand the\r\ncauses of terrorism should not be misunderstood as\r\nbeing soft on terrorism. On the contrary, it is an\r\nessential step in its elimination. I can speak from\r\nexperience of developments in my own country for\r\nmany decades.\r\nThe Government and people of Afghanistan face\r\nimportant challenges in the coming year, in particular\r\nthe adoption of a constitution and the holding of\r\nnational elections. Severe difficulties stand in the way,\r\nespecially the precarious security situation. The\r\nsustained and wholehearted support of the international\r\ncommunity is required if Afghanistan is to recover\r\nfrom its long ordeal. For Ireland’s part, it has delivered\r\non its pledges to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\r\nIn Africa, encouraging progress has been made in\r\nthe past year towards the resolution of some long-\r\nstanding and intractable conflicts. We urge the parties to\r\nthe conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to\r\nimplement the commitments that they have entered into.\r\nNeighbouring States must abide by their commitments\r\nand their obligation not to interfere in the area.\r\nSierra Leone remains on track, with the help of\r\nthe United Nations, towards a future and peaceful\r\ndevelopment. And progress has been achieved in\r\nLiberia. I want to pay tribute to the efforts of those\r\nMember States that have contributed to this positive\r\ndevelopment. Their continued engagement, along with\r\nthe United Nations, will be indispensable in helping the\r\npeople of Liberia to consolidate what has been\r\nachieved and to build peace in their country. I am\r\npleased to inform the Assembly that my Government in\r\nthe next few days will recommend to our Parliament\r\nthat Ireland’s Defence Forces participate with a\r\nsizeable contingent in the forthcoming United\r\npeacekeeping operation in Liberia.\r\nRespect for human rights is an essential foundation\r\nfor peace and security. Lack of respect for human rights is\r\nat the root of many conflicts, internal and international.\r\nThe promotion of human rights is rightly the concern\r\nof the international community as a whole. It must\r\nremain a central task of the United Nations and must be\r\nintegrated into all United Nations activities.\r\nThere is no room for complacency. We must all\r\nrecognize that no country, including our own, is\r\nperfect. We can all do better.\r\nI pay tribute to the many brave individuals around\r\nthe world — defenders of human rights — who risk\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\ndiscrimination, imprisonment or worse to ensure that\r\nGovernments live up to their human rights obligations.\r\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\r\nCourt was a clear signal of the determination of the\r\ninternational community to bring to justice those who\r\nare involved in genocide, crimes against humanity and\r\nwar crimes. Ireland, together with its partners in the\r\nEuropean Union, will continue to offer firm support to\r\nthe International Criminal Court, as its work gets under\r\nway. I urge those who have not signed or ratified the\r\nRome Statute to do so, and I urge all States to adhere\r\nfirmly to the principles on which it is based.\r\nThe peace process in Northern Ireland remains a\r\nmajor priority for the Irish Government. Regrettably,\r\ndue to diminishing trust between the political parties,\r\nthe devolved political institutions in Northern Ireland\r\nwere suspended nearly one year ago. Since then, we have\r\nbeen working to re-establish the trust and confidence\r\nnecessary to restore and sustain these institutions.\r\nThis involves both ensuring that all vestiges of\r\nparamilitary activity are consigned to the past and that\r\nall parties commit themselves to the full and stable\r\noperation of the democratic institutions of the Good\r\nFriday Agreement. Following intensive negotiations,\r\nwe came tantalizingly close in April to making the\r\nrequired breakthrough but unfortunately did not get\r\nmatters fully resolved at that time.\r\nAfter one of the most peaceful summers on the\r\nstreets of Northern Ireland, the process is now entering\r\nanother decisive phase of challenge and opportunity.\r\nDevelopments over the next few weeks will have a\r\ncrucial bearing on whether elections — which I believe\r\nshould take place before the end of the year — will be\r\nheld in an atmosphere that is conducive to forming a\r\nworking administration on the other side of the polling\r\nday.\r\nFor this to happen, all of the pro-Agreement\r\nparties must show leadership and courage, face up to\r\ntheir responsibilities and take the decisions they know\r\nare right, and encourage their constituencies to reach\r\nout to others. As partners in this process, Prime\r\nMinister Blair and I — and our two Governments —\r\nare working closely together to support and encourage\r\nall those political and community leaders who are\r\ntaking risks for peace.\r\nFrom other areas around the world struggling to\r\nescape from a legacy of violence, we in Ireland know\r\nall too well that a process of conflict resolution cannot\r\nrest still. Either it continues to move forward or it loses\r\nmomentum and direction and falters. To complacently\r\nassume that current opportunities for progress can be\r\ndeferred until a more politically convenient moment is\r\nboth wrong and dangerous. In the case of Northern\r\nIreland, the moment of opportunity is now and it is my\r\nhope that in the weeks and months ahead all of the\r\nparties who subscribed to the Good Friday Agreement\r\nwill collectively rise to that challenge.\r\nPoverty and insecurity go hand in hand. The\r\nefforts of the United Nations to promote international\r\npeace and security must be closely aligned with its\r\nwork in tackling the root causes of poverty.\r\nWhen I launched the United Nations Human\r\nDevelopment Report in Dublin last July, I noted how\r\npowerful a reminder it was that the world is becoming\r\na more unequal place. According to the report, 54\r\ncountries — the great majority of them in Africa — are\r\npoorer now than they were in 1990. A world where\r\nmore than 1.2 billion people continue to live on less\r\nthan a dollar a day, where 14 million children are\r\norphaned because of HIV/AIDS and where women in\r\nthe poorest countries are 175 times more likely to die\r\nin childbirth than women in rich countries is inherently\r\nunjust and hence insecure.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAt the United Nations special session on\r\nHIV/AIDS in 2001, I said Ireland would increase its\r\ncontribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS by an\r\nadditional $30 million per year. Last year, our spending\r\non HIV/AIDS programmes exceeded $40 million — a\r\nten-fold increase over the past three years.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration called for a global\r\npartnership for development, and as in any partnership,\r\nthere are responsibilities on all sides. Undertakings on\r\nofficial development assistance, debt relief, and\r\ngovernance must be achieved. We must be rigorous in\r\nassessing our progress in 2005, as we committed\r\nourselves to doing.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, I committed Ireland\r\nto reaching the United Nations target for official\r\ndevelopment assistance of 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product by 2007. Since then, Ireland has\r\nincreased its official development assistance to 0.41\r\nper cent and remains committed to reaching the target\r\nby 2007.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nFair and open international trade is essential for\r\nglobal peace and prosperity. It is an integral part of the\r\nmultilateral system that we are pledged to protect. I\r\nregret that it did not prove possible to reach agreement\r\nat the recent World Trade Organization talks in\r\nCancun. I understand the frustration of those who\r\nconsider themselves unfairly treated in global markets.\r\nBut if we turn our back on the multilateral trading\r\nsystem and allow trade and investment to be diverted\r\nand distorted by bilateral and regional arrangements,\r\nwe will damage — perhaps irreparably — the best tool\r\navailable to us to make serious inroads into poverty\r\nand to raise standards of living on a global basis. Let us\r\nredouble our efforts to achieve an agreement that offers\r\nfair market access and at the same time allows all of us\r\nto preserve the essence of our unique cultures and\r\nenvironments.\r\nThe past year might have been a difficult one for\r\nthe United Nations, but events have demonstrated that\r\nfor the people of the world it is the indispensable\r\nOrganization at the centre of our system of collective\r\nsecurity. We have invested it with unique legitimacy\r\nand authority. People around the world look to it in\r\nhope and expectation. Let us work together to make\r\nsure that the United Nations is an organization worthy\r\nof the ideals enshrined in its Charter, worthy of the\r\ntrust of those who rely on it for help and protection,\r\nworthy of the idealism and dedication of those who\r\nwork for it and worthy of the sacrifice of those who\r\nhave given their lives in its service.\r\nAs the Secretary-General made clear when he\r\naddressed this session of General Assembly: we are at\r\na fork in the road. Let us be sure to take the right road.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of\r\nIreland for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bertie Ahern, Prime Minister of Ireland, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by The Honourable Mr. Edward Fenech\r\nAdami, Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta.\r\nMr. Edward Fenech Adami, Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Malta, The Honourable Mr. Edward\r\nFenech Adami, and in inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Adami (Malta): I would first like to\r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. You have an important and challenging task\r\nahead. In executing your duties, you can be assured of\r\nmy full support and that of the Maltese delegation.\r\nI take this opportunity to express our appreciation\r\nto the outgoing President of the fifty-seventh session,\r\nMr. Jan Kavan, for the dedication and initiative with\r\nwhich he accomplished his task. I would also like to\r\nexpress our support for the Secretary-General. The past\r\n12 months have been a particularly difficult time for\r\nhim and for the Organization he serves so well. We\r\nrespect and admire the patience, tact, wisdom and\r\ndetermination that he has once again demonstrated in\r\nthese trying times.\r\nThe attack on the United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad on 19 August has added an unwelcome\r\ndimension of tragedy and urgency to this year’s session\r\nof the General Assembly. Our thoughts are with the\r\nrelatives and friends of the victims, to whom we again\r\nexpress our deepest condolences. Not for the first time\r\nin its history the United Nations is mourning the\r\nviolent death of its talented servants in the course of\r\ntheir duty.\r\nBesides being a human tragedy, it was indeed —\r\nfor the first time — also a direct and deliberate attack\r\non the United Nations itself. In this sense, an analysis\r\nof the implications of the attack in Baghdad needs to\r\nform an integral part of the broader considerations\r\nrelating to the structures and objectives of the\r\ninternational system.\r\nThe reality is that in the United Nations the\r\ninternational community has a system that is both vital\r\nand indispensable. However, it is also a fact that the\r\ninternational community has taken this system for\r\ngranted for too long. Events over the last few weeks\r\nand months constitute a renewed reminder that urgent\r\nreform is necessary. We need to heed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s advice that this action has to be radical.\r\nOne important element in the process of building\r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity lies in the\r\nregional dimension. That dimension was given its\r\nimportance in the original architecture of the United\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nNations Charter. Over the last 12 months Malta,\r\ntogether with nine other countries, successfully\r\nconcluded negotiations to join one of the most creative\r\nand impressive manifestations of regional cooperation:\r\nthe European Union. The results of those negotiations\r\nwere confirmed by the people of Malta, first in a\r\nreferendum and subsequently in the general elections\r\nheld earlier this year. Our desire to join the European\r\nUnion stems primarily from our appreciation of both\r\nthe history and the present reality of the European-\r\nMediterranean region, and of Malta’s place and role in\r\nthat region.\r\nAt the same time, for Malta, the objective of\r\nmembership in the European Union has also been a\r\nfurther means of deepening and reinforcing its\r\nlongstanding commitment towards international\r\ncooperation and solidarity.\r\nWe are gratified to see how the European Union\r\nis fast becoming one of the main partners of the United\r\nNations in the collective endeavour towards global\r\ncooperation and solidarity. We are encouraged to discover\r\nhow much that partnership enhances the opportunities for\r\neven the smaller members to play a positive and\r\nconstructive role in many issues of global concern.\r\nAmong such issues, the question of security in all\r\nof its complex dimensions has assumed formidable\r\nproportions this year. One of the more disturbing\r\naspects in that regard is the way in which the different\r\ndimensions of terrorism and arms control have become\r\nintertwined. That link has become a factor in the\r\nsometimes differing perceptions of the sources of the\r\nsecurity risks faced by States. In turn, that has led to\r\ndifferences of emphasis in action priorities, even among\r\nStates with otherwise very convergent policies and\r\napproaches. When such differences are reflected within\r\nthe Security Council itself, there is a risk of erosion to the\r\nstill fragile structure of international legitimacy.\r\nOn the question of Iraq in particular, it is\r\ncritically important for the Security Council to reach\r\nearly agreement on the role the United Nations must\r\nplay in the re-establishment of order and legitimacy in\r\nthat country. We strongly urge all members of the\r\nCouncil, in particular the permanent members, to spare\r\nno effort to achieve that objective.\r\nThe question of armaments today confronts us in\r\nits bewildering complexity. At one extreme is the\r\noutrageous reality of child soldiers brandishing lethal\r\nconventional weapons. At the other extreme is the\r\nincreasingly credible prospect that terrorist groups will\r\nprocure and use weapons of mass destruction to bring\r\nmajor tragedy and destruction to the hearts of States.\r\nThese extremes have intruded into the more traditional\r\ndisarmament process that has itself been moving\r\nforward hesitantly and intermittently over the years.\r\nYet however hesitant and intermittent it may be,\r\nthe disarmament process has produced some results\r\nupon which we can build further. A range of agreements\r\nand instruments are already available concerning both\r\nweapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons.\r\nThe more immediate challenges in this regard lie in the\r\nareas of compliance and verification.\r\nOver recent months, the European Union has\r\nbeen working on a comprehensive security strategy on\r\nthe issues of non-proliferation and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. One of the key principles underpinning\r\nthis strategy is the need to uphold and implement the\r\nmultilateral treaties and agreements that exist in this\r\narea. Equally important is the need to support the\r\nmultilateral institutions charged with verifying and\r\nensuring compliance with these agreements. Primary\r\namong these institutions is the United Nations.\r\nTerrorism in our day is a phenomenon that is\r\nunprecedented in terms of motivation, tenacity and\r\nmethods. Over the past 12 months terrorist acts have\r\nindiscriminately struck peoples, both in areas of active\r\nconflict and elsewhere. The counter-terrorism measures\r\nput in place following the attack here in New York on\r\n11 September 2001 provide us with tools which can\r\nhave an effect if applied forcefully, universally and\r\nconsistently. Our response must remain adamant and\r\nclear. At the same time, as the Secretary-General\r\nreminds us, while there is an unquestionable need to\r\nconfront terrorist groups with determination, this\r\nshould never be at the expense of the commitment to\r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe objective of increased security at the global\r\nlevel demands efforts across a range of widely different\r\nfronts, ranging from issues relating to peacemaking and\r\npeacekeeping, to issues relating to economic and social\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe United Nations has a steady record of\r\npositive involvement in peacekeeping. The recent\r\nexperiences in Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste and Kosovo\r\nprovide encouraging instances of this. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral reminds us that peacekeeping efforts, and\r\nespecially what he terms “robust” peacekeeping, must\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nbe provided with both the necessary capabilities and an\r\nadequate mandate. He also correctly points out that\r\npeacekeeping must be preceded by effective action\r\ntowards conflict resolution.\r\nThe question of Palestine is one issue with regard\r\nto which sustained efforts at conflict resolution have\r\nnot yet prevailed. Over the past few weeks we have\r\nbeen witnessing the gradual disintegration of yet\r\nanother major and sustained effort at peacemaking in\r\nthat region.\r\nThe immediate obstacles to peace in Palestine\r\narise from two contrasting directions. On the one hand\r\nis the reality of an illegal occupation of territory\r\noriginally achieved, and continuously maintained, by\r\narmed force. On the other is the reality of a resistance\r\nto this occupation that uses unacceptable means of\r\ncivilian terror and destruction to pursue its ends.\r\nThese two realities feed upon each other in a\r\nvicious cycle of ever-escalating hatred and violence.\r\nPerhaps the most frightening aspect of the situation in\r\nPalestine is the fact that each successive failure of\r\neffort towards peacemaking ratchets up the level of\r\nhatred and violence. The international community\r\nneeds to find a way of breaking the conditionality\r\nwhich makes the two extremes feed upon each other.\r\nIsrael needs to clearly recognize the illegality of\r\nits presence in the occupied territories. This implies the\r\nreversal of the measures that are accompanying this\r\noccupation — in particular the building and maintenance\r\nof settlements and the construction of the partition wall\r\non Palestinian territory.\r\nFurthermore, the support of the chosen leadership\r\nof the Palestinian people is necessary if progress\r\ntowards peace and stability is to be achieved. In this\r\nspirit, we call upon Israel to desist from any act of\r\ndeportation and cease any threat to the safety of the\r\nelected President of the Palestinian Authority.\r\nFor their part, the Palestinians must recognize\r\nthat all violent acts against civilians are unacceptable\r\nand must stop unconditionally. The Palestinian\r\nAuthority needs to assert its control and prevent any\r\nfurther acts of terrorism.\r\nIn spite of the latest setbacks, the approach by the\r\nQuartet still needs to be supported and encouraged. By\r\nvirtue of its composition, the Quartet offers the best\r\nprospects for finding ways of breaking the\r\nconditionality that feeds the extremes on both sides.\r\nThe hope remains that, at the core of both the Israeli\r\nand the Palestinian populations, the desire for peace\r\nand reconciliation is stronger than the delirium of fear\r\nand hatred.\r\nMalta always views the problem of Palestine\r\nfrom the perspective of its effect on issues of security\r\nand cooperation in the Mediterranean. Our membership\r\nof the European Union will provide us with enhanced\r\nopportunities to intensify our traditional role in this\r\nregard.\r\nProgress in the process of Euro-Mediterranean\r\ncooperation has been slow but steady since the\r\nEuropean Union launched its Euro-Mediterranean\r\ninitiative in 1995. The process has itself been affected\r\nby the vicissitudes of the situation in Palestine over\r\nthese years. Yet the general trend has remained\r\npositive, even in the most difficult of times.\r\nThe recent resolution of the Lockerbie issue\r\nfurther helps in creating the right atmosphere for\r\nenhanced regional cooperation.\r\nIt is now our hope that the work of the\r\nSecretary-General, accompanied by the efforts of\r\npersuasion of the European Union, will succeed in\r\nresolving one of the still outstanding problems in our\r\nregion — the problem of Cyprus. Malta would\r\nwelcome in May next year the integration of a reunited\r\nCyprus into the folds of the European Union.\r\nOne of the major strengths of the Euro-\r\nMediterranean process lies in the linkage that it\r\nmaintains between security issues and wider issues of\r\ncooperation in the economic and humanitarian fields.\r\nIn his report this year, the Secretary-General underlines\r\nthe fact that issues related to development form an\r\nimportant part of the commitments undertaken under\r\nthe Millennium Declaration. The Secretary-General\r\nnotes that a stronger consensus has been forged on this\r\nissue. But he also cautions that grave doubts remain as\r\nto whether Member States are sufficiently determined\r\nto act on this consensus.\r\nThe failure of the World Trade Organization\r\nmeeting in Cancún last week highlights the difficulties\r\ninherent in translating broad consensus into concrete\r\naction. In the area of trade, as in other areas of\r\ndevelopment, it is indeed the case that globalization\r\nhas exposed a major disequilibrium and great\r\ninequalities in the international arena. In some respects\r\nit has also exacerbated the injustices arising from those\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\ninequalities. There is an even greater need, therefore,\r\nfor the international community to persevere in its\r\nefforts towards more concrete and effective measures\r\nof consensus-building. The high-level meeting on\r\nHIV/AIDS that recently concluded highlights the way\r\nin which problems that have a global dimension need\r\nto be tackled.\r\nThe problem of AIDS also underlines the\r\nimportance of continuing efforts towards norm-setting\r\nin the various dimensions of international life.\r\nThe practice of holding annual treaty events,\r\ninstituted following the Millennium Summit, has\r\nproved its value in this regard. This year’s event is\r\nfocusing on Treaties against transnational organized\r\ncrime and terrorism. On that occasion, Malta will be\r\ndepositing its ratification of the United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime and\r\ntwo of its protocols. We will have thus already ratified\r\nor acceded to 11 of the 15 Treaties on which the\r\nSecretary-General has focused for this year’s event.\r\nOne area where norm setting is in its early stages\r\nconcerns the issue of cloning. Malta approaches this\r\nissue from a moral and ethical standpoint based on the\r\ndeepest respect for human life. We believe that while\r\nscientific considerations are sometimes relevant in\r\nmatters of this nature, final decisions must primarily be\r\nbased on fundamental human, ethical and moral\r\nconsiderations. In this spirit, the draft resolution\r\nproposing a convention that bans all forms of human\r\ncloning fully reflects our views. For this reason we will\r\nsupport this draft resolution. At the same time, we also\r\nbelieve that on issues of such deep ethical and moral\r\nsensitivity, real progress can only be achieved through\r\nconsensus.\r\nThe issues before the General Assembly are many\r\nand wide-ranging. Such a dense and varied agenda\r\nconfirms the relevance and vitality of our Organization.\r\nAt the same time, it also points to the problems\r\nregarding the effectiveness and functionality about\r\nwhich so many of us are concerned.\r\nI trust that under your guidance, Mr. President,\r\nthe Assembly will find the wisdom and energy to\r\nclearly define its priorities and take the necessary\r\naction. I wish you every success in your endeavours.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Malta for the statement he has just made.\r\nThe Honourable Edward Fenech Adami, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta, was escorted\r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to the\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Israel, His Excellency Mr. Silvan Shalom.\r\nMr. Shalom (Israel): I would like to congratulate\r\nHis Excellency, the Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia,\r\nupon his assumption of the Presidency of the General\r\nAssembly, and wish him much success.\r\nUntil just one month ago, every person in this hall\r\nand every Member of this Organization joined us in the\r\nhope that the Middle East peace process might finally\r\nbe back on track, and that a resolution of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict might be on the horizon. The\r\nestablishment of a new Palestinian Government\r\npromised an end to terror and a new beginning.\r\nThis glimmer of hope was darkened on 19 August\r\nby the extremists who blew up a bus full of Jewish\r\nfamilies on their way home from prayers at the Western\r\nWall, the holiest site in the Jewish religion. Twenty-\r\nthree people, young and old, mothers and babies in\r\ntheir cradles, were slaughtered in that attack. That\r\nattack was carried out by Hamas, a terrorist\r\norganization, which, under the road map, should have\r\nbeen dismantled by the Palestinian Authority. Failure\r\nto dismantle Hamas and other extremist organizations\r\nhas brought our diplomatic efforts to a standstill.\r\nRather than acting to fulfil its obligation, the\r\nPalestinian Authority has chosen the route of inaction,\r\nand complicity in terror.\r\nWe cannot allow this to continue. We must restore\r\nhope that we can build a better future for our children.\r\nThe infrastructure of terror must be dismantled so that\r\nwe can put our peace efforts back on track. There is no\r\ntime other than now. There is no other way.\r\nFor many years it was thought that terrorism in\r\nthe Middle East was Israel’s problem, not the world’s.\r\nToday, the world knows otherwise. Today, it is not only\r\nIsrael that mourns the loss of its loved ones, including\r\nwomen and children and babies, at the hands of the\r\nterrorists. Sadly, we have been joined by peoples from\r\nacross the globe — from Mombassa to Casablanca and\r\nfrom Moscow to Bali. Even the United Nations, which\r\nfor so many has been a symbol of peace and goodwill,\r\nis not immune.\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nGathered here today in New York, just two short\r\nyears after 11 September, the community of nations\r\nknows that those who seek to advance their political\r\nagendas through killing innocents are ready to strike at\r\nanyone or anything that represents the values of\r\nfreedom and human life.\r\nTerrorism has declared war on us all. Israel has\r\noften stood alone in this battle. A country that has\r\nsuffered more than any other from terrorism, we have\r\nalways understood the danger it poses to democracy\r\nand freedom everywhere, even when others refused to\r\nsee this, and condemned us for our actions. We have\r\nalways understood that terrorism, no matter what cause it\r\nclaims to serve, seeks only to destroy, rather than to build.\r\nThere can be no neutrality in the war against\r\nterrorism and there can be no immunity for those who\r\nengage in it. Abstaining is not an option. This is not a\r\nwar of choice. Terrorism will not be eliminated until\r\nthe world unites against it. Our only choice is to win.\r\nEvery member of the international community must\r\ntake concrete and proactive measures to cut off all\r\nchannels of financial, moral and political support to\r\nthis common enemy.\r\nStates Members of this institution that sponsor\r\nterrorists and give them shelter are accomplices in the\r\nacts of terror themselves. They must be held\r\naccountable for their crimes. It is no coincidence that\r\nStates that sponsor terrorism, like Iran and Syria, are\r\nalso striving to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\r\nTheir hostility to freedom and the rule of law puts the\r\nvery future of humanity in jeopardy.\r\nI know that many in this place see Yasser Arafat\r\nas the symbol of the Palestinian struggle. Tragically,\r\nfor his people and for ours, he is one of the world’s\r\nicons of terror. In the 10 years since Arafat made a\r\ncommitment to Israel and the world that he would no\r\nlonger use terror, 1,126 Israelis have been killed and\r\nthousands wounded in 19,000 separate Palestinian\r\nterrorist attacks. In relative numbers, this would be the\r\nsame as 11,000 French or 56,000 Americans dying\r\nfrom terrorism in the same period of time.\r\nThis carnage must stop. Its impact on both\r\nsocieties is devastating. Yasser Arafat bears direct\r\nresponsibility for this terrible suffering. He has led his\r\npeople along the path of terror — from hijackings to\r\nsuicide bombings — for more than 30 years, always\r\npreferring Israeli pain over Palestinian gain. He has\r\nbeen — and he remains — the greatest obstacle to\r\npeace between our peoples. For as long as he controls\r\nthe levers of power, no moderate leadership can\r\nemerge. To vote for Arafat, like we saw in this\r\nAssembly just last week, is to vote against the\r\nPalestinian people. When Arafat wins, terrorism wins,\r\nand we all lose. Instead of rallying around Arafat, the\r\ninternational community must rally around the genuine\r\ninterests of the Palestinian people. They must do so\r\nnow, before he leads them even further down the path\r\nof terror and destruction.\r\nWhen a responsible and empowered Palestinian\r\nleadership finally emerges — a leadership ready to join\r\nthe war on terror — it will find us a willing partner for\r\npeace. Israel is committed to the vision for Middle East\r\npeace laid out by United States President George Bush\r\non 24 June 2002. Israel will not compromise on the\r\nsafety of its citizens, but we will go the extra mile, as\r\nwe have proven before, to bring peace and security to\r\nboth our peoples.\r\nWe are ready to work with the Palestinians and\r\nwith the international community to make this vision a\r\nreality. For this to happen, the Palestinian leadership\r\nmust take the moral and strategic decision to abandon\r\nterrorism once and for all, and make peacemaking\r\npossible. They must guide their people to build their\r\nown society, rather than seek to destroy ours. They,\r\ntoo, must understand that it is not poverty that breeds\r\nterror but terror that breeds poverty.\r\nWe cannot stop only at dismantling the\r\ninfrastructure of terror. We must also build an\r\ninfrastructure of peace. It is up to political and moral\r\nleaders everywhere to foster an environment which\r\nrejects extremism and empowers the peacemakers. This\r\nis particularly so in the Arab and Muslim world, where\r\nincitement against Israel closes hearts and minds to the\r\npossibility of peace.\r\nLeaders must guide their people away from the\r\nculture of hate, and replace it with a culture of\r\ntolerance. Concrete expressions of cooperation and\r\nexchange must be built in media and government,\r\neducation, science and business, to reinforce the\r\nmessage of tolerance and acceptance.\r\nFor the sake of our collective future, voices of\r\nmoderation must be heard. For the sake of our\r\ncollective future, Israel and the Arab nations must learn\r\nto live together side by side, to overcome our conflicts\r\njust as the nations of Europe have learned to overcome\r\ntheirs. Israel is living among its Arab neighbours. We\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nbelieve in a common future of peace and prosperity\r\nwith them. My many meetings with Arab leaders over\r\nthe last few days have encouraged me to believe that\r\ntogether we can make our region a better place.\r\nThis culture of peace must permeate not only the\r\nborders of the Middle East, it must permeate the walls\r\nof the United Nations as well. In the past, the United\r\nNations has shown us that it can play a positive role.\r\nThis Assembly was key to the founding of the State of\r\nIsrael, 55 years ago. Security Council resolutions 242\r\n(1967) and 338 (1973) are our guideposts to\r\nnegotiations and peace.\r\nTo play such a constructive role in the future, the\r\nUnited Nations must reform. It must move away from\r\nthe partisan hostility that has taken over its Middle East\r\nagenda. For more than three decades, this Assembly\r\nhas passed every year a litany of resolutions designed\r\nto discredit Israel, challenge its interests, and promote\r\nthe will of its greatest enemies.\r\nIn my hand I am holding a collection of the\r\ndecisions of the fifty-seventh General Assembly on the\r\nMiddle East — 175 pages filled not with hope, but with\r\nthe negative agendas of the past. No other country has\r\nsuffered such unjustified attack and consistent\r\ndiscrimination within the United Nations system. The\r\ntime has come to end this campaign of diplomatic\r\nincitement. For the sake of Israelis and Palestinians —\r\nfor the sake of the United Nations and peace itself — I\r\ncall on this body to rise above the tired politics of\r\nyesterday, and adopt a new, courageous agenda for\r\ntomorrow.\r\nI call on the General Assembly to abandon the\r\nautomatic adoption of anti-Israel resolutions and to\r\nfind ways of making itself relevant once again to the\r\ninterests of the people it claims to serve. I call on this\r\nAssembly to fulfil its historic mission and help\r\npromote what unites us, not what divides us.\r\nOn the morning of 1 February of this year, Israel\r\nlost its first astronaut in the Space Shuttle Columbia\r\ndisaster — a skilled and courageous pilot whom I knew\r\npersonally, a child of Holocaust survivors, a national\r\nhero. Colonel Ilan Ramon embodied the spirit of our\r\nnation. He was a man of courage and action, dedicated\r\nto the well-being of his people. Just as he sought to\r\ncontribute to the advancement of his fellow man, he\r\nmet his death, together with colleagues from the United\r\nStates and India, on a scientific mission in the name of\r\nhumanity as a whole.\r\nIsrael’s place in such endeavours of international\r\ncooperation and accomplishment is no coincidence. In\r\nthe 55 years since the State of Israel was established,\r\nrecognized and welcomed into the family of nations,\r\nour achievements in the fields of science and\r\ntechnology, the arts and literature and agriculture and\r\nmedicine have come to rank with the best in the world.\r\nOur international cooperation programme is celebrated\r\nin over a hundred countries around the globe, sharing\r\nskills, experience and knowledge for the benefit of\r\nmillions of people. We extend this hand of friendship\r\nto all the nations of the world. We welcome our\r\nimproving relations with Europe, just as we remain\r\ncommitted to promoting closer ties with the nations of\r\nAfrica, Asia and the Americas.\r\nThe Zionist vision of Israel’s founders was to\r\nbring into the world a State in our ancient homeland to\r\nserve as a haven from persecution for our people, a\r\nplace where the Jewish people could fulfil its right to\r\nself-determination in the modern era and a bastion of\r\ndemocracy and opportunity for all its citizens. Our\r\nfounders also made a promise not just to the people of\r\nIsrael, but also to the people of the Middle East as a\r\nwhole — to pursue peace and to work for the common\r\nadvancement of our region.\r\nI know personally the profound meaning of this\r\nhistoric undertaking. I came to Israel as a young\r\nrefugee from Tunisia. I serve as one of hundreds of\r\nthousands of immigrants to whom Israel has granted\r\npromise and protection, freedom and opportunity,\r\nthrough the values and institutions of democracy.\r\nI stand here today to reaffirm, before the nations\r\nof the world, the commitment of my country to peace.\r\nPeace for the people of Israel is both a moral and\r\nhistoric imperative. “Shalom” — the word for peace in\r\nHebrew — is central to our language and our heritage.\r\nIt is how we say “hello” and it is how we say\r\n“goodbye”. It is a name we give to our children. It is\r\nmy own family name.\r\nIt was our prophet Isaiah, who brought this\r\nmessage of peace to the world centuries ago, when he\r\nsaid: “And they shall beat their swords into\r\nploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks.\r\nNation shall not lift up sword against Nation, neither\r\nshall they learn war any more”.\r\nIsrael’s historic record is clear. Whenever a true\r\npartner for peace has emerged, he has been met with\r\nIsrael’s extended hand. This was true when President\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nAnwar Sadat of Egypt came to Jerusalem in 1977 and it\r\nwas true when King Hussein of Jordan signed the\r\nPeace Treaty with us in 1994. The same is true today.\r\nIsrael stands ready to complete the circle of peace with\r\nall its neighbours — real peace, not just peace for the\r\nheadlines, but peace which brings an end to violence\r\nand hostility and positive change for the citizens of our\r\nregion.\r\nFrom this great rostrum — a rostrum shared by\r\nall humanity — I call on the leaders of Syria and\r\nLebanon, of Iran and of the Palestinian people to\r\nabandon once and for all their hostility towards us and\r\nto join us in building a better future for our children.\r\nThis evening, I shall return to Jerusalem, the\r\neternal capital of the Jewish people, to join with them\r\nin celebrating Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.\r\nAccording to our tradition, this is a time when God\r\ndetermines the fate of each and every individual for the\r\ncoming year. These are days of reflection and prayer.\r\nMay all our prayers for peace and for life be answered,\r\nand may the actions and deeds of all the States and\r\npeoples represented here in this Hall bring to mankind\r\npeace and all the blessings that life can offer.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency the\r\nRight Honourable Mr. Jack Straw, the Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMr. Straw (United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland): I begin by paying a tribute to Dr.\r\nAkila Al-Hashimi, a senior member of the Iraqi\r\nGoverning Council, who died earlier today.\r\nI had the privilege of meeting Dr. Al-Hashimi\r\nearlier this year in London and later in Baghdad, and I\r\nwas struck by her courage and her dedication to the\r\nIraqi people. Dr. Al-Hashimi was murdered by those\r\nwho would deny the Iraqi people the democratic,\r\nprosperous future they so richly deserve. The best\r\nservice that we can render her memory is to defeat the\r\nterrorists and to ensure that her vision of a peaceful,\r\nfree Iraq prevails.\r\nOf course, we owe this service to all those who\r\nhave fallen in the cause of peace in Iraq. Sergio Vieira\r\nde Mello and the United Nations personnel who were\r\nkilled or injured in the blast in Baghdad on 19 August\r\nwere committed to bringing the ideals of the United\r\nNations to the people of Iraq. They paid the ultimate\r\nsacrifice for their dedication. We mourn their loss, but\r\nwe will not weaken in our resolve to help the Iraqi\r\npeople rebuild their country on the principles of justice\r\nand security.\r\nWhat, I think, makes Iraq so important was the\r\nway in which it tested the role and purpose of this\r\ninstitution over more than a dozen years. Throughout\r\nthat period, the international community remained in\r\nagreement that the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a\r\nChapter VII threat to international peace and security\r\nby its proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\r\nprogrammes and its unparalleled defiance of the will of\r\nthe United Nations. Yet, earlier this year, sadly, we\r\ndivided on when and what action was necessary to deal\r\nwith the Iraqi threat.\r\nOf course, I acknowledge the controversy over\r\nthe military action which the United Kingdom, the\r\nUnited States and others took and the heavy\r\nresponsibilities we now bear, but I firmly believe that\r\nthe decisions we took were the right ones. The\r\nauthority of the United Nations was at stake. Having\r\ngiven Saddam Hussein’s regime a final opportunity to\r\ncomply with the United Nations, what would have\r\nhappened if we had simply turned away? Would the\r\nworld be a safer place today? Would Iraq be a better\r\nplace today? Would the United Nations be a stronger\r\ninstitution today? The answer to each of those\r\nquestions is no. Saddam Hussein would have been\r\nemboldened by our failure to act; every dictator would\r\nhave been encouraged to follow his example; and the\r\nauthority of this United Nations would have been\r\ngravely weakened.\r\nYet, whatever the arguments of the spring, we\r\nhave now to come together again for a common\r\npurpose. As the Security Council has recognized in its\r\nthree resolutions 1472 (2003), 1483 (2003) and 1500\r\n(2003), we have a shared interest in helping Iraqi\r\ncitizens to embrace the rights and freedoms which they\r\nhave been denied so long and for which this institution\r\nwas founded. Yes, the security situation does present\r\nformidable challenges. Terrorists who despise freedom\r\nare seeking to plunge Iraq into chaos. They have\r\ninflicted terrible blows on the Iraqi people, coalition\r\nsoldiers and international aid workers, but ultimately\r\nthey will fail.\r\nAnd let us also not lose sight of what has been\r\nachieved and what is taking shape. Saddam Hussein’s\r\nreign of terror is over. The apparatus of torture and\r\noppression which claimed hundreds of thousands of\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nlives is at an end. Instead, we have the beginnings of a\r\nrepresentative Government run by Iraqis for Iraqis;\r\nnew ministries providing daily services to the people; a\r\nfree press; the freedom for members of all religious\r\ncommunities to worship as they wish; hospitals and\r\nschools in operation; bustling traffic on the streets and\r\nhighways; and a start to real economic regeneration.\r\nWe shall stay in Iraq as long, but only as long, as\r\nit is necessary to meet our clear responsibilities and to\r\nrestore sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as we\r\ncan in an orderly manner. I hope very much that we can\r\nagree a new Security Council resolution to strengthen\r\nthe United Nations role in Iraq. In managing this\r\ntransition, we should be guided by three central\r\nprinciples: first, the transfer of powers must reflect\r\nrealities on the ground in Iraq, particularly the need to\r\nensure security; secondly, the Iraqi institutions must be\r\nsufficiently robust to take on increasing responsibilities;\r\nand thirdly, the exercise of executive powers and\r\nresponsibilities must be based on good governance,\r\ninvolving representative Iraqi authorities and coherent\r\nconstitutional arrangements. In other words, the timetable\r\nshould be driven by the needs of the Iraqi people and their\r\ncapacity progressively to assume democratic control,\r\nrather than by fixing arbitrary deadlines.\r\nIraq is, sadly, not the only territory in the Middle\r\nEast where the international community faces great\r\nchallenges. Three months ago, we all had high hopes\r\nabout the work of the Quartet of the United Nations,\r\nthe European Union, the Russian Federation and the\r\nUnited States in Israel and the occupied territories. It is\r\ntragic that these hopes were blown apart on 19 August\r\nby the terrorist atrocity in Jerusalem, which came only\r\na few hours after the terrorist atrocity against the\r\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, but the international\r\ncommunity has to stay united on both the means and\r\nthe ends in the Middle East. There are no alternatives\r\nto the road map and there can be no alternatives to the\r\noutcome the entire world wishes to see — two States,\r\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace and\r\nsecurity. This can be the only fitting memorial to the\r\nthousands who have died on both sides since the\r\nbeginning of this appalling conflict.\r\nThe breadth of the issues being tackled by the\r\nUnited Nations and its agencies demonstrates the\r\ncontinued relevance of this institution. The Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee has given the United Nations a\r\nfocus for its work following 11 September two years\r\nago, but we must now build upon that work, giving the\r\nCommittee the expertise and the remit to reinforce the\r\ncapacity of Member States to tackle and to overcome\r\nterrorism.\r\nWe also know that proliferation is one of the\r\ngreatest threats we face alongside terrorism. Much\r\ngood work on proliferation is being done by United\r\nNations agencies, particularly the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency, but it is extraordinary that the Security\r\nCouncil itself has not addressed the issue of\r\nproliferation for over 10 years. In our judgement, it is\r\ntime that it did.\r\nProblems of internal conflict, on the other hand,\r\nare regularly on the Security Council’s agenda. The\r\nUnited Nations has unrivalled expertise and experience\r\nin this area and has achieved great things in countries\r\nas far apart as East Timor and Sierra Leone, but nation-\r\nbuilding is a collaborative effort, requiring the\r\nresources and commitment of Member States if the\r\nUnited Nations peace-building is to be effective. We\r\ntherefore need new mechanisms to help prevent\r\nconflicts and then to help States before they collapse.\r\nWe must also make a real success of the\r\nMillennium Declaration. We have to overcome the\r\nsetback of Cancún and secure a positive outcome to the\r\nDoha Round.\r\nThese and other shared problems require\r\ncollective responses, as our Secretary-General so\r\neloquently said here in his speech on Tuesday. A key to\r\nthis is to ensure that the United Nations itself remains\r\nan effective global forum capable of delivering results.\r\nThe Secretary-General posed some difficult questions\r\ntwo days ago. I welcome his initiative to seek the\r\nadvice of a distinguished group to make proposals on\r\nreform. I welcome, too, his parallel commitment to\r\nmodernizing the United Nations and its agencies.\r\nFor our part, the United Kingdom is committed to\r\nmaking the Security Council more representative. The\r\nissue is not whether but how to do this. A bigger and\r\nmore representative Council, however, will not of itself\r\nmake it easier to make the tough choices which it has\r\nto face so often. The most important ingredient is the\r\npolitical will and determination of the members of the\r\nCouncil to take effective action.\r\nThe most important part of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s speech on Tuesday was about the choices\r\nnow confronting the United Nations. He was right\r\nabout those. We have indeed come to a fork in the road.\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nDown one route lies a world in which the United\r\nNations strengthens its role as the collective instrument\r\nfor protecting our peace and security; down the other\r\nroute lies a world in which collective action becomes a\r\nsynonym for “inaction”. We must not take this second\r\nroute. The Secretary-General’s speech was a challenge\r\nto all of us. We all share a world in which international\r\nterrorists strike down the innocent, regardless of faith\r\nor nationality, and we are all less secure when weapons\r\nof mass destruction are in reckless hands. We do not\r\nhave the luxury simply of rejecting unilateralism, while\r\nproposing no multilateral means of confronting and\r\ndealing with these threats.\r\nThe British Government is profoundly\r\ncommitted, as it always has been, to the ideals of the\r\nUnited Nations. To us, the importance of this\r\nOrganization has always been its ability to put those\r\nhigh ideals into effect. We will work wholeheartedly\r\nwith the Secretary-General and the international\r\ncommunity to ensure that the United Nations retains\r\nand strengthens both its idealism and its effectiveness.\r\nThe President: I now call His Excellency Mr. Jan\r\nKarlsson, Minister for Development Cooperation,\r\nMigration and Asylum Policy and Acting Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Sweden.\r\nMr. Karlsson (Sweden): In the early morning of\r\n11 September 2003, our Foreign Minister Anna Lindh\r\ndied, murdered in a senseless crime. One of Sweden’s\r\nmost prominent and respected leaders is gone. We have\r\nlost a part of our future. She spoke for the oppressed,\r\nfor the victims of human rights violations. She worked\r\nfor international peace and justice and for multilateral\r\ncooperation. The voice of Anna Lindh has been\r\nsilenced, but her burning conviction echoes with us.\r\nWe meet at a time when the United Nations is\r\nfacing difficulties and doubts. The capability of the\r\nUnited Nations has often been in question. Despite\r\ncrises and shortcomings, the United Nations has always\r\nwithstood these tests. The United Nations was\r\nindispensable in 1945 and it still is.\r\nGlobal security cannot be achieved by unilateral\r\naction. Locking ourselves in will not bring peace,\r\ndevelopment, democracy or respect for human rights.\r\nWe must work together to define and address emerging\r\nchallenges for multilateral solutions.\r\nThe Secretary-General recently said:\r\n“We can no longer take it for granted that\r\nour multilateral institutions are strong enough to\r\ncope with all the challenges facing them”.\r\n(A/58/323, para. 4)\r\nI welcome Kofi Annan’s challenge to us. The Nordic\r\ncountries stand behind him. The United Nations and\r\nwe, the Member States, must adapt. Reform is\r\nnecessary to stay modern, responsive and efficient and\r\nto retain the trust of global civil society. International\r\nsolidarity must be in focus when redefining our\r\ncommon agenda. Attaining the goals of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration is a shared responsibility.\r\nThe legitimacy and authority of the Security\r\nCouncil must be regained. Its composition must better\r\nreflect the world of today. I believe that an agreement\r\non enlargement with a number of non-permanent\r\nmembers could be reached fairly quickly, without\r\nexcluding the possibility of additional permanent\r\nmembers at a later stage.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s intention of\r\nestablishing a high-level panel to consider threats to\r\nour security and the institutional reforms required for\r\nthe United Nations to respond.\r\nNorth Korea has withdrawn from the Treaty on\r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and\r\nremains unclear about its intentions. The nuclear\r\nprogramme in Iran, the possession of nuclear weapons\r\nby India and Pakistan, and Israel’s refusal to sign the\r\nNPT continue to cause concern. In several countries,\r\nnuclear weapons are accorded a growing importance in\r\nmilitary doctrines. Discussions in the United States\r\nabout the creation of a new generation of smaller\r\nnuclear arms are worrying to us. Such weapons would\r\nnot contribute to a safer world, but risk lowering the\r\nthreshold for the use of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe threats from weapons of mass destruction can\r\nonly be met by multilateral efforts. The negative arms\r\nspiral must be reversed. The non-proliferation Treaty\r\nmust be universally complied with. Sweden continues\r\nto work for this goal, together with its partners in the\r\nNew Agenda Coalition.\r\nWe need new ideas on disarmament and non-\r\nproliferation and on how to strengthen existing\r\nregimes. To this aim, Sweden has initiated an\r\nindependent, international commission chaired by Mr.\r\nHans Blix. Last June, the General Assembly adopted a\r\nforward-looking resolution on the prevention of armed\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nconflict. Sweden will continue to work for a\r\nstrengthening of the capacity of the United Nations\r\npractical preventive work.\r\nOur focus must be the security of the individual.\r\nViolations of human rights can never be accepted. State\r\nsovereignty also implies responsibility. If Governments\r\nfail to protect their people, the international community\r\nmust be prepared to act. In its report The Responsibility\r\nto Protect, the International Commission on\r\nIntervention and State Sovereignty points out important\r\nissues for the international community to take on. How\r\ncan we make sure that sovereignty and independence\r\nnever become a license to abuse people? How should\r\nthe international community live up to its responsibility\r\nwhen States fail to protect their people?\r\nWe must make full use of instruments available to\r\navoid war. The Security Council must be ready to act\r\non early warning signals on threats of mass violations\r\nof human rights. Mechanisms to prevent such situations\r\nmay be intrusive in character and need to be\r\nstrengthened based on accountability and international\r\nlaw. As the Secretary-General said in his speech on\r\nTuesday, the Security Council needs seriously to\r\ndiscuss the best way to respond to threats of genocide\r\nor other comparable massive violations of human\r\nrights. Prevention of genocide will be the topic for the\r\nStockholm International Forum to be held in my\r\ncountry in January.\r\nThere must be an end to impunity. The\r\nInternational Criminal Court is now operational. The\r\nCourt will act as a deterrent to perpetrators and a\r\nuniversal and equal tool for justice.\r\nTwo years ago, Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was\r\naccompanied to the General Assembly by her then 11-\r\nyear-old son David. When he entered the Hall, he\r\nasked: “Mom, where are all the women?” He saw what\r\nmany of us seem blind to. There are too few women\r\nhere, as in very many decision-making bodies around\r\nthe world. Gender equality is about making use of all\r\nhuman resources.\r\nWomen are strong, but they are made vulnerable\r\nthrough legal, economic and social discrimination.\r\nWomen are made victims of violence in war, of abuse\r\nat home, of trafficking, of sexual exploitation. For\r\nthese women, gender equality is a question of life and\r\ndeath. Women’s equal rights to education, to a\r\nprofessional career and to participate in politics are not\r\na threat to us men. The absence of these rights is a\r\nthreat to the progress of mankind.\r\nPeace operations require joint efforts to be\r\nsuccessful. The cooperation between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations, such as the recent\r\nexperience in the Democratic Republic of Congo —\r\nPresident Kabila’s discussion of which the other day\r\nwe listened to very carefully — the European Union-\r\nled police mission in the Western Balkans and the\r\nmilitary operation in Macedonia, are all examples of\r\nthis. We will continue developing the cooperation\r\nbetween the United Nations and the European Union\r\nand welcome the political declaration on crisis\r\nmanagement.\r\nMany painful lessons can be drawn from the\r\nviolent conflicts in West Africa. Sweden welcomes the\r\nlarge and broadly based United Nations peacekeeping\r\nMission in Liberia. The international community must\r\nsupport the United Nations and the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States in finding sustainable\r\nsolutions for the entire region. The European Union is\r\ntrying to strengthen such a partnership through the work\r\nof Hans Dahlgren, its Special Representative to the\r\nMano River Union countries.\r\nWomen are crucial to peace and reconciliation. I\r\nwelcome the fact that gender perspectives are now\r\nbeing incorporated into mandates and activities of all\r\npeacekeeping missions. The number of women in peace\r\noperations at all levels should increase. The\r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1325\r\n(2000) and the strengthening of the United Nations\r\ncapacity in this field are vital.\r\nThe decision to cut poverty by half by 2015 is\r\nimperative, but we are not doing well enough. The pace\r\nat which the goal is being realized is far too slow. We\r\nnow need new financial mechanisms and partnerships.\r\nIn this spirit, we welcome the initiative presented a few\r\ndays ago by the President of Brazil.\r\nOfficial development assistance needs to treble.\r\nIn Monterrey, the States members of the European\r\nUnion agreed to increase official development\r\nassistance. Sweden is increasing its assistance to 0.86\r\nper cent of its gross domestic product next year.\r\nPledges must be followed by real cash money. We need\r\nto give the United Nations predictable, long-term\r\nfinancing. I entirely agree with what President Chirac\r\nsaid a few days ago: “Failing that, we will end up with\r\na pick-and-choose United Nations”. (A/58/PV.7)\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.11\r\nThe main responsibility for development is borne\r\nby every country itself in promoting democracy, good\r\ngovernance and respect of human rights. Official\r\ndevelopment assistance will always only be\r\nsupplementary, as we all know. More important is the\r\npromotion of open and fair trade rules, the dismantling\r\nof tariffs and the reduction of subsidies. We expect the\r\ndeveloped countries to show the way and to bring\r\nforward the Doha Development Agenda. Indeed, we\r\nmust all see to it that the setback in the trade\r\nnegotiations in Cancún is turned into a new start.\r\nThe Swedish Government presented a new bill in\r\nMay this year on a coherent policy for global\r\ndevelopment. This is our way of translating the\r\nMillennium Declaration into national policy. We will\r\nput particular emphasis on the commitment to the\r\neighth Millennium Development Goal, which is\r\nspecifically about the obligations of the rich countries.\r\nThe consequences of climate change affect us all.\r\nThe deterioration of the Kyoto Protocol must be halted.\r\nWe need a global system for migration that\r\nprotects immigrant’s rights and provides security for\r\npeople who cross borders to study, research or work.\r\nSweden and Switzerland support the Secretary-General\r\nin wishing to strengthen the role of migration on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda, including the establishment of\r\na global commission on migration and development.\r\nThe General Assembly has rightly condemned the\r\nIsraeli decision to deport President Arafat. Both parties\r\nmust implement their obligations in accordance with\r\nthe road map. We urge the Palestinian Authority to take\r\naction to cease the suicide bombings. Israel’s\r\nextrajudicial killings are contradictory to international\r\nlaw and must be stopped immediately.\r\nThe international community must do its utmost\r\nto assist the parties in the peace process. The road map,\r\nas Jack Straw pointed out only a few minutes ago,\r\nshould be implemented immediately with a view to the\r\nestablishment of a peaceful and democratic Palestinian\r\nState in 2005. International monitors and observers\r\nshould be sent to the area and Sweden is willing to take\r\npart in such a monitoring mechanism.\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello and many of his\r\ncolleagues lost their lives in the bombing of the United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad about a month ago, a\r\nterrible loss for the international community. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello personified, better than most, the\r\nstrength and commitment of the international\r\ncommunity at its best.\r\nThe situation in Iraq remains volatile and\r\ndangerous. We are concerned about the security of the\r\nIraqi people and of those who are in Iraq to ease their\r\nsuffering. The bombing in Baghdad was aimed at the\r\npurposes that the United Nations stands for — to\r\nmaintain international peace and security. It will not\r\nmake us waiver. The United Nations will stay in Iraq.\r\nThe international community needs the legitimacy of\r\nthe United Nations as the only authority to be derived\r\nfrom in helping the Iraqi people recover self-\r\ngovernment and rebuild their country. The handling of\r\nthe conflict must remain an exception and not become\r\na rule.\r\nThe future of the United Nations now lies in the\r\nhands of the Member States. If the United Nations\r\nfails, we all fail. In the statements most referred to so\r\nfar in this year’s debate, the media have competed in\r\nfinding differences and disputes, but there is one thing\r\nthat we all agree on. That is the belief in our United\r\nNations. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has the world\r\nbehind him.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n"
