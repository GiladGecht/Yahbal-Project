(Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alfred Moisiu, President of the\r\nRepublic of Albania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Albania.\r\nMr. Alfred Moisiu, President of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alfred Moisiu, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Albania, and to invite him\r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Moisiu (spoke in Albanian; English\r\ntext furnished by the delegation): At the outset, allow\r\nme to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession. I am fully convinced that, under your\r\nleadership, the proceedings of this session will be\r\ncrowned with success.\r\nIt is only right that, in addressing the present\r\naudience, my first thought should go to Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, the United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General to Iraq. From\r\nthis rostrum, I wish to pay homage to his activity and\r\ncontribution and to express profound sadness over the\r\nloss of his and other human lives in the cruel terrorist\r\nattack on the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad.\r\nThis session is convening at the end of a year full\r\nof challenges and achievements for the international\r\ncommunity, and certainly for the United Nations. We\r\nbelieve that the United Nations has identified the\r\nmaintenance of peace, security and international stability\r\nand the protection of human rights as the fundamental\r\nobjectives of its activity. This is best reflected in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, which outlines the common\r\nvision for building a better world without conflict or\r\npoverty. We share the opinion of Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan that the major changes that occurred across\r\nthe world following the events of 11 September 2003,\r\nthe phenomenon of international terrorism and the wars\r\nin Afghanistan and Iraq have emphasized the need to\r\naddress the major challenges of our times from a new\r\nperspective and, in this context, to further improve the\r\nperformance of the United Nations structures.\r\nIn this spirit, Albania did not hesitate to join the\r\nUnited States-led coalition against international terrorism.\r\nAlbania has signed 12 international conventions and\r\nprotocols in the war against terrorism. It is working\r\nclosely with its neighbours, other countries at large and\r\ninternational bodies with a view to eradicating the\r\npotential sources of various forms of terrorism.\r\nWe underscore the need for vigilance,\r\ncoordination and reaction in the face of the threats\r\ncurrently posed by weapons of mass destruction. These\r\nweapons  be they chemical, biological or nuclear \r\nare even more dangerous in the hands of terrorists. At\r\nthe same time, we are actively participating in the\r\npeacekeeping missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nas in Bosnia and Georgia, as a demonstration of our\r\nwill and commitment to the war on terror and to efforts\r\nto secure peace and security. We consider that deep-\r\nrooted democratic changes are important for both\r\nAfghanistan and Iraq. It is our conviction that the\r\nability to live in freedom, despite the difficulties of\r\ntransition, marks a point of no return on the journey\r\naway from dictatorship and from the terror that\r\nthreatens others as well.\r\nAlbanian politics and society have adopted a\r\nunified approach towards Euro-Atlantic integration,\r\nwhich is one of our major priorities. Consistent with\r\nour vital interests, the integration process has all\r\npopular support. We regard this not merely as a\r\nmechanical affiliation to the European Union and the\r\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but as\r\nadherence to the standards and values of freedom,\r\ndemocracy and the free market. Given the brief period\r\nsince the onset of these changes and the negative heritage\r\nof the past, we must recognize that Albania has made\r\nimportant and substantial achievements on the road of\r\ndemocracy, but this is no reason for complacency.\r\nWe are aware that it will take far greater effort to\r\nmove the initiated reforms forward, especially in the\r\nrealm of the judiciary, the economy and the fight\r\nagainst crime and corruption, the latter having afflicted\r\npost-communist societies in general. We are already in\r\nthe process of negotiation on the Stabilization and\r\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union. The\r\nThessaloniki summit once again confirmed the open-\r\ndoor policy to be pursued towards Albania and the\r\nother four countries of the Western Balkans.\r\nSignificant positive steps have also been taken\r\nconcerning the NATO membership process, specifically\r\nfollowing the Prague summit. The commitment of\r\nAlbania, Croatia and Macedonia under the Adriatic 3\r\nCharter will bring them closer to membership\r\nstandards. We maintain that our convergence towards\r\nthe standards of NATO and the European Union today\r\nand our full-fledged membership tomorrow will benefit\r\nthe countries of our region, just as it will benefit\r\nEurope itself and overall peace and security.\r\nAlbania considers regional cooperation to be a\r\nprerequisite and encouragement for Euro-Atlantic\r\nintegration. We believe that the pursuit of dialogue, as\r\nwell as enhanced cooperation and understanding\r\namong the Balkan countries, deeply reflect the\r\naspirations of our citizens and impart a fresh impulse to\r\nthe integrating processes. The Balkans, which not long\r\nago were known as a source of conflicts and crises,\r\nnow reveal a different picture that has changed in a\r\npositive way, with a significantly moderated political\r\nclimate prevailing in the area. The region of former\r\nnationalistic clashes has turned into an area in which\r\nthe culture of dialogue and good understanding is\r\nputting down roots. Although the supporters of the\r\ndivisive and tragic past are still active in politics,\r\noverall the new political class in the Balkans is looking\r\nforward to the future and cooperation.\r\nAlbania and the Albanians are playing an active\r\nrole in building and strengthening this new spirit. We\r\nwant and are working to ensure that we establish\r\nfriendly relations of cooperation with all the countries\r\nin the region, so that we can move ahead towards our\r\ncommon European future. The investment our countries\r\nare making in a Euro-Atlantic future is one of the\r\nprincipal guarantees that the region will free itself from\r\nthe bitter past and join the democratic flow of our times.\r\nAlbania and the Balkans attach special\r\nimportance to the enhancement of stability and the\r\nreinforcement of democracy in the areas formerly\r\nknown as hotbeds. We appreciate the democratic and\r\nintegrating developments in Kosovo, which do credit to\r\nthe contribution of the United Nations Interim\r\nAdministration Mission in Kosovo and the former\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Steiner. We support the new mission under the\r\nleadership of Mr. Holkeri and admire the performance\r\nof society and institutions in Kosovo towards building\r\na democratic model of coexistence among its citizens.\r\nStability in Kosovo is very important for stability\r\nin the region. That is why we have consistently\r\nbolstered the reforms and the achievements made with\r\nregard to the establishment and strengthening of the\r\ndemocratic institutions there. We have denounced acts\r\nof violence and have encouraged every initiative that\r\nhelps to ensure respect for the norms of a democratic\r\nsociety, enforce the rule of law, promote a sustained\r\nand developed market economy, build democratic\r\ninstitutions, maintain inter-ethnic harmony and\r\nfacilitate the return of displaced persons.\r\nAlbania has urged and supported the efforts to\r\nstart a dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade on\r\nmutually beneficial technical issues. We claim that the\r\npursuit of dialogue is the best way to address problems\r\nand to create the necessary trust. Albania is of the\r\nopinion that the future of Kosovo, and hence its final\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nstatus, is an issue that ought to be decided at a later\r\nstage, which should not be postponed indefinitely.\r\nIt is already widely recognized that this status\r\nwill be determined through the will of the citizens of\r\nKosovo in cooperation with the international\r\ncommunity. Compliance with the required standards\r\nand determination of status are closely related and\r\ninterdependent issues. The standards ensure the normal\r\nfunctioning of the local institutions, while the status\r\nbrings about stability, peace and development in\r\nKosovo and the region.\r\nThe positive developments in Macedonia also\r\ngive rise to hope for the achievement of lasting\r\nstability. We maintain, however, that the integral\r\nimplementation of the Ohrid Agreement without delay\r\nis of crucial importance to the future of Macedonia.\r\nAlbania denounces the extremists on all sides and\r\nabides by the spirit of tolerance and inter-ethnic\r\ncoexistence.\r\nThe Republic of Albania supports the plans and\r\ninitiatives aimed at providing a comprehensive and\r\nlasting solution to the situation in the Middle East. In\r\nthat context, we consider the road map to be the way\r\ntowards the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict. Before reaching that settlement, however,\r\nviolence and terrorist acts should be renounced forever.\r\nDialogue and the spirit of agreement should be\r\npromoted until an enforceable final solution is found.\r\nWe believe that peace in the Middle East is an\r\nimportant pillar for peace and security the world over.\r\nThe settlement of the Palestinian issue is essential for\r\nthe resolution of the crisis in the Middle East and a\r\ncore element for success in the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe Albanian State values and believes in an\r\neven greater role of the United Nations in the\r\nstrengthening of peace, security and economic and\r\nsocial development throughout the world. Albania\r\nsupports reform to make the United Nations an ever\r\nstronger organization, capable of coping with the\r\nchallenges of the present and providing timely\r\nsolutions to issues of concern to all its Members. In\r\nthat respect, we welcome the objectives the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has set for the reform of the Organization as a\r\nwhole and for its specific organs, including the General\r\nAssembly and the Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reaffirm Albanias\r\ncommitment to fulfilling its obligations stemming from\r\nthe decisions to be taken during the present session of\r\nthe General Assembly of the United Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Albania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alfred Moisiu, President of the Republic of\r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the\r\nRepublic of Guyana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted into the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President\r\nof the Republic of Guyana and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Jagdeo: It is a great pleasure for me to\r\naddress the General Assembly under the presidency of\r\na fellow citizen of our Caribbean Community. Allow\r\nme to extend our warmest congratulations and good\r\nwishes to you, Sir, as you discharge the functions of\r\nyour high office.\r\nI offer our esteemed Secretary-General our\r\nappreciation for his astute and steadfast leadership in\r\nthese times of great challenge to the Organization. I\r\nwould also like to pay tribute to his dedicated staff,\r\nmany of whom have lost their lives in service to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn 1953, the people of Guyana were allowed for\r\nthe first time to exercise their democratic franchise\r\nunder universal adult suffrage to elect the Government\r\nof their choice. Today, 50 years later, my country has\r\nlearned, through the painful experience of misrule and\r\nmismanagement, the vital importance of democracy to\r\nour future as a nation. We recognize that to foster\r\ndevelopment, reduce poverty and safeguard human\r\ndignity, democracy must be allowed to grow and take\r\nroot. Having laid the basic foundation for good\r\ngovernance through free and fair elections, we now\r\nface the task of building a more prosperous and just\r\nsociety.\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nTo that end, my Government has embarked on a\r\nprocess of consultation and collaboration with all\r\nsectors of our population, including political parties,\r\nthe private sector and non-governmental organizations.\r\nThrough the recent reform of the Constitution,\r\nprovisions have been made to enhance fiscal\r\ntransparency, provide greater inclusiveness and\r\nguarantee the fundamental rights of our people. Those\r\nmeasures include six independent commissions on\r\nhuman rights, ethnic relations, women and gender\r\nequity, indigenous peoples, the rights of the child and\r\npublic procurement.\r\nMoreover, in an effort to foster greater social\r\ncohesion in Guyana, we recently invited the United\r\nNations Special Rapporteur on Racism to visit and\r\nengage the various sectors of Guyanese society so that\r\nthe international community can be informed of the\r\nbroad perspectives of our multicultural society and of\r\nthe several measures which the Government has put in\r\nplace to promote interracial harmony.\r\nIn further consolidation of the democratic\r\nprocess, my Government has embarked upon a\r\nprogramme to reform the justice and security systems\r\nin our society by building capacity for the prevention,\r\ninvestigation and resolution of crime and for the\r\nimprovement of the administration of justice. Much has\r\nbeen accomplished in that area, but much more remains\r\nto be done.\r\nAt the same time, we have taken several\r\ndevelopment initiatives that will ultimately lead to a\r\nbetter life for all our people. Among them are the\r\nnational development strategy and the poverty\r\nreduction strategy. We have worked hard to provide\r\nbetter housing, health and education facilities for our\r\npeople and have managed to make signal progress in\r\nreducing poverty. And by stimulating investment, we\r\nare creating new opportunities for development. We\r\nnow look to the future with the renewed hope that we\r\nwill be able to overcome the many challenges to our\r\npolitical, economic and social progress.\r\nHowever, in the face of a persistent debt burden,\r\ndrastically reduced development assistance and ever\r\npresent protectionist barriers, and in the prevailing\r\nclimate of international tension and uncertainty, many\r\ndeveloping countries, Guyana included, are made more\r\nvulnerable, and prospects for growth are severely\r\nimpaired. The failure of the recently concluded Cancún\r\nConference does not make us sanguine about the\r\nfuture. The international community is now hardly\r\nlikely to reach the Millennium Declaration targets that\r\nwere set by this Assembly three years ago.\r\nThe fate of nations, especially of those as small\r\nas ours, lies not in our hands alone. The process of\r\nglobalization has made us acutely aware of the need for\r\ngreater interdependence and international cooperation\r\nif we are to survive the many threats to our welfare.\r\nThat interdependence is the basis for multilateralism\r\nand for the United Nations.\r\nThe Charter of the Organization reflects our\r\ncollective commitment to cooperate to promote peace\r\nand development. However, we have yet to fully\r\nhonour that commitment. Regrettably, the world in\r\nwhich we live now, while placing a high premium on\r\ndemocracy at the national level, fails to live up to that\r\nideal in the international councils that shape our\r\ncommon destiny. We are concerned at that double\r\nstandard, as the aspirations of humankind for peace,\r\nsecurity and development cannot be fulfilled without\r\nthe effective participation of all States in global affairs.\r\nEspecially disconcerting is the practice by some\r\ncountries and international financial institutions to rely\r\non anecdotal or partial information  often from\r\nquestionable sources  to assess the performance of a\r\ngiven country. Needless to say, that can be very\r\ndamaging to the particular economy concerned, as it\r\neffectively deters further aid and investment. Similarly,\r\nwe are concerned by the inordinate delay in the release\r\nof development funds. The Heavily Indebted Poor\r\nCountries Debt Initiative, which was conceived as a\r\nmeans of assisting seriously indebted poor countries,\r\nhas been unconscionably delayed. Meanwhile, the poor\r\nof our countries must face continuing hardship and\r\nsuffering. They cannot be held hostage for much longer.\r\nThe success of international cooperation, and\r\nindeed of the United Nations system, will be determined\r\nby how well they respond to the interests and concerns of\r\nnot only the powerful but also the powerless, and not\r\nonly of the rich but, most urgently, of the poor. If truth\r\nbe told, their record thus far leaves much to be desired.\r\nIt is therefore imperative that a credible and effective\r\nsystem of global governance be established as quickly\r\nas possible. That will require a more fundamental\r\nreform of the United Nations, and indeed of the entire\r\nmultilateral system, than we have seen so far.\r\nAfter several crises in the decade of the 1990s,\r\nthere was a strong call for reform of the international\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nfinancial architecture to provide greater macroeconomic\r\nstability. The urgency of the campaign appears to have\r\ndiminished, however, even though the threat of further\r\ncalamity remains. Attempts to strengthen the role of\r\nthe United Nations in the development process now lag\r\nbehind, denying our countries a greater say in the\r\ndecision-making process pertaining to issues that affect\r\nour welfare. Nor have we been able to develop an\r\neffective security system to protect countries,\r\nparticularly the weak and small, from encroachments\r\non their sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nOur world continues to be subject to a wide array\r\nof threats to international peace and security. We\r\nrecently witnessed a series of terrible human tragedies.\r\nMany thousands have died as a result. If there is one\r\nlesson to be learned, it is that violence accomplishes\r\nnothing. Only through dialogue and negotiation,\r\nbolstered by social justice, can lasting solutions to\r\nthose problems be found. It is therefore imperative that\r\nthe United Nations, the multilateral Organization to\r\nwhich we all belong, be strengthened to effectively\r\npromote peace and development.\r\nIt is time that the United Nations Security\r\nCouncil, which has the primary responsibility under the\r\nCharter for international peace and security, be made\r\nmore representative of the wider international\r\ncommunity. The Council must be expanded, and the\r\nrole of developing countries in that body appropriately\r\nstrengthened. To that end, Guyana is prepared to\r\nsupport the candidacies of Brazil, India and an African\r\ncountry for permanent seats on the Council, as well as\r\na suitable number of non-permanent seats for other\r\ndeveloping countries. That expansion will no doubt\r\nenable it to better cope with the challenges that\r\nconflicts, both old and new, pose to global peace and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nNeither the many speeches that we make nor the\r\nseveral strategies that we occasionally devise in the\r\nhope of building global peace and development will\r\never accomplish much unless they are followed up by\r\nappropriate action. Sad to say, our frequent\r\ndeclarations of intent are not matched by deeds, a\r\nfailure that can be explained only by the lack of serious\r\npurpose on the part of many Member States. We have\r\nyet to transcend selfish national interests to reach a\r\nhigher plane of interdependence and multilateralism. I\r\nurge the international community to rethink its policies\r\nand to seriously consider the advantages of a more\r\nbalanced and equitable system of relations.\r\nThe world in which we now live calls for greater\r\ninternational solidarity and cooperation, not less. We\r\nmust therefore ensure that those ideals are at the\r\nforefront of our deliberations at the General Assembly\r\nand that we take practical steps to ensure and\r\nstrengthen our common home, the United Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Guyana for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bharrat Jagdeo, President of the Republic of\r\nGuyana, was escorted from the General Assembly\r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of\r\nthe Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the President of the Republic of\r\nMadagascar.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Marc Ravalomanana,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Madagascar, and to invite\r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Ravalomanana (spoke in French):\r\nThe United Nations is at a crossroads. The fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly is taking place at a\r\ncritical time in the history of the Organization.\r\nHowever, that moment could also be decisive for the\r\nfuture of the Organization. Recent developments on the\r\ninternational scene represent a call to action that\r\ncompels us to review its organization and rules so that\r\nit may serve all nations.\r\nYour election, Mr. President, to the presidency of\r\nthe principal body of the United Nations will contribute\r\nto the achievement of those objectives. I would also\r\nlike to pay tribute to Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan\r\nfor his dedication to the cause of international peace\r\nand security and for his ongoing desire to achieve the\r\ncommon good of mankind.\r\nInternational peace and security continue to be\r\ndangerously precarious as internal conflicts and\r\nconfrontations between States proliferate in many\r\nregions of the world. We believe that the refusal to\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nimplement obligations imposed upon States under\r\ninternational law and the violation of the provisions of\r\nthe Charter are two areas of grave concern to us. Never\r\nsince its creation has the Organization been confronted\r\nwith so many situations and divergent views seriously\r\nthreatening the attainment of its goals. Unity and\r\ncohesion among the members of the Security Council\r\nare essential in order to strengthen the credibility of the\r\nUnited Nations and the confidence of Member States\r\nand to ensure that organs effectiveness, as it is the\r\norgan with primary responsibility for the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMr. Win Aung (Myanmar), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nLet me mention the struggle against terrorism,\r\nwhich no longer hesitates to attack our Organization.\r\nOn this issue, Madagascar is truly at one with the\r\ninternational community in its struggle against that\r\nscourge. Accordingly, we have ratified the 12 existing\r\ninternational conventions to combat terrorism. We take\r\nthis opportunity to pay heartfelt tribute to the late\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, our Representative in Iraq.\r\nThe creativity and courage of our Secretary-\r\nGeneral in shouldering his responsibilities and\r\ncommitments to peace and security, in a spirit of\r\nsolidarity, deserve the support of all. We endorse the\r\nrecommendations contained in his report aimed at\r\nstrengthening the United Nations. We hope to see\r\nchanges in our Organization that would place greater\r\nemphasis on the importance of the General Assembly\r\nas the principal deliberative and decision-making organ\r\nand on rendering the Security Council more\r\nrepresentative and more transparent.\r\nSuch reforms are necessary in order to protect the\r\nsovereignty of smaller nations. They are indispensable,\r\nfor the common interests of the peoples of the world\r\nshould have no platform other than the General\r\nAssembly. We support the proposals made by Mr.\r\nCouchepin, President of the Swiss Federation, to forge\r\na new vision of security by increasingly involving\r\nindividuals in the deliberative process.\r\nA strong United Nations will be able to find\r\nsolutions for integrating economic and social questions\r\ninto the framework of the peace and security of peoples.\r\nThe economic and social situation in the world\r\nremains a source of great concern. The beneficial\r\nimpact of global economic growth has circumvented\r\nour island, as it has done with other countries in Africa.\r\nIn the course of this past decade, major United Nations\r\nconferences have pinpointed strategies and established\r\nobjectives to achieve sustainable human development.\r\nBut we still need to mobilize the necessary resources to\r\nimplement, together, the declarations we all adopted \r\ndeclarations which kindled so much hope in our\r\npeoples, who are languishing in dire poverty.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration set deadlines for a\r\nnumber of common objectives for all Member States.\r\nSuch goals are achievable, but they remain to be\r\nattained. The new form of international cooperation\r\nbased on partnerships between the public and private\r\nsectors offers us this opportunity, particularly since this\r\nis a mutually advantageous relationship.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council, in the\r\nDeclaration it adopted on 2 July last, emphasizes the\r\nimportance of partnerships at the national and\r\ninternational levels with a view to promoting\r\ncooperation among various sectors. The Economic and\r\nSocial Council solemnly committed itself to facilitating\r\nand supporting the creation of alliances between\r\nGovernments, donors, non-governmental organizations,\r\ncivil society, decentralized communities and the private\r\nsector in order to promote integrated rural\r\ndevelopment. Our country is very pleased at having\r\nbeen elected to preside over the United Nations Public-\r\nPrivate Alliance for Rural Development and at having\r\nbeen chosen as the first pilot country.\r\nMadagascar, like most African countries, has not\r\nbenefited from the world economic expansion. More\r\nthan 70 per cent of the population of Madagascar still\r\nlives below the poverty line. Fifty per cent of the\r\npopulation has no access to drinking water, and, as a\r\nresult, 50,000 children die annually. I am not going to\r\npass judgement here, but I an convinced that a\r\nfundamental dilemma exists: the past does not loom as\r\nlarge in other parts of the world as it does in Africa. In\r\nAfrica, the past is part and parcel of the structure of\r\nsociety and of peoples mindsets.\r\nAt the same time, we are confronted with the\r\nchallenges of the policies, values, economic trends and\r\ntechnology of the twenty-first century. Africa is\r\nsuffering from major gaps in this respect, more than\r\nother continents. To bridge such gaps is not an easy\r\nprocess. Whatever the case may be, Africa must take\r\nup the challenges of the future and undertake the\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nimplementation of good governance and of a rapid and\r\nsustainable economic development.\r\nTodays Madagascar is a different country. It is\r\naiming to establish a true democracy based on the rule\r\nof law and on respect for international law. Good\r\ngovernance, the rule of law, the combat against\r\ncorruption, decentralization, participation of the\r\npopulation and the support of the private sector are its\r\npillars. Restoring the confidence of economic players,\r\nestablishing conducive and secure conditions for\r\nbusiness and sharing responsibilities are key, with the\r\nState playing the role of facilitator. These are the main\r\nunderpinnings of our economic activities.\r\nLet us not forget that the key to success is the\r\nright approach. In order to encourage investments,\r\nvarious laws have been enacted in order to reduce\r\nimport taxes and duties on capital goods. At present\r\nforeign investors can own real estate.\r\nFurthermore, agreements to protect investments\r\nhave been signed or are being prepared. We are\r\nextremely grateful for the efforts undertaken by\r\nnational and international donors. Personally speaking,\r\nI know that it is not easy to collect the necessary funds\r\nfor poor countries when the world economy itself is\r\nshowing signs of weakness.\r\nI am convinced that the efforts of African\r\ncountries designed to improve their cooperation in the\r\ncontext of the African Union, the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development, the Common Market for Eastern\r\nand Southern Africa (COMESA), the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), the Indian Ocean\r\nRim and other organizations will lead to the expected\r\nresults.\r\nBut this is not enough. Madagascar is opening up,\r\nand I dare to hope that other countries will also follow\r\nsuit. But the world itself is not opening up, as was seen\r\nat Cancún. Why then can we not use as an example the\r\nEuropean expansion process? This may be difficult and\r\ncostly, but the outcome is promising and the procedures\r\nare already known.\r\nWill the international community and the African\r\ncountries find a common vision for the future of\r\nAfrica? Personally, I believe that it is high time that the\r\nmajor Powers took steps towards a more equitable\r\npartnership. We receive credits, grants, experts and\r\nprogrammes, but what do we read in the international\r\npress every day? That Africa is a forgotten continent.\r\nUnfortunately, this is true. We are far away from the\r\nstrategic spheres of the think tanks, of the heads of\r\nState of the major Powers, and of the chief executive\r\nofficers of large corporations. In other words, Africa\r\nremains the victim of marginalization.\r\nDoes the international community have\r\nconfidence in the future of Africa? Is it not true that it\r\nis urgent to develop a different outlook for our\r\ncontinent?\r\nWe have this confidence. Our objectives are clear,\r\nbut our capacities are still low. We need assistance in\r\nthe area of capacity enhancement in order to attain the\r\nobjectives we have set for ourselves. We are ready to\r\nwork tirelessly; we are ready for change, ready for\r\nopenness. However, we would like to have more\r\nsupport, greater openness and especially a different\r\noutlook and a new vision for our own continent in this\r\nconcert of nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Madagascar for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Marc Ravalomanana, President of the\r\nRepublic of Madagascar, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Colonel Azali Assoumani, President of\r\nthe Union of the Comoros\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of the Union of the\r\nComoros.\r\nColonel Azali Assoumani, President of the Union\r\nof the Comoros, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Colonel Azali Assoumani,\r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Assoumani (spoke in French): It is a\r\ngreat pleasure for me to join with others who have\r\nspoken before me in congratulating, on behalf of my\r\ncountry, the Union of the Comoros, and on my own\r\nbehalf, Mr. Julian Hunte on his election to preside over\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. We are\r\nconvinced that, given his wisdom and extensive\r\nexperience, he will guide our work to a successful\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\noutcome. I am very pleased to assure him of the full\r\ncooperation and support of my entire delegation.\r\nI would also like to express appreciation for the\r\nopenness demonstrated by his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Kavan, throughout the fifty-seventh\r\nsession of the General Assembly, over which he\r\npresided with the skill and farsightedness that we all\r\nknow so well.\r\nI also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, for his dedication to this global Organization  a\r\nsentiment that I am sure is shared by all nations.\r\nIt goes without saying that the challenges before\r\nus are great, as many changes are taking place in the\r\nworld at an ever-increasing rate, requiring renewed\r\ncommitment on the part of the United Nations, as well\r\nas a strengthening of its role. Unfortunately, every day\r\nwe see evidence of the risks that such changes entail.\r\nIn this context my country, the Union of the Comoros,\r\njoins those who have paid tribute to the memory of the\r\nUnited Nations staff members who fell as a result of\r\nthe indiscriminate violence and terrorism in Baghdad,\r\nincluding the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello.\r\nToday more than ever, we should be concerned\r\nabout the direction in which the world is heading. The\r\nworld is characterized by violence, poverty and despair\r\n despite the fact that science and technology have\r\nnever been more advanced and wealth never more\r\nabundant. The division of the world into developed and\r\ndeveloping countries does nothing to assuage our\r\ncommon fears and uncertainties.\r\nIt is true that the countries of the North are,\r\nincreasingly, questioning themselves on the subject\r\nterrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. But it must be recognized that the\r\ncountries of the South, while asking themselves the\r\nsame questions, are also labouring increasingly under\r\nthe burden of debt, civil war, insecurity, poverty and\r\nendemic disease. The pursuit of security and harmony\r\nin the world therefore requires a sustained focus on all\r\ncountries with a view to achieving a safer, more unified\r\nand more humane world.\r\nOf course, as we see every day, terrorism,\r\ncowardly and indiscriminate, thrives in poverty and\r\nseeks to express itself through violence, exploiting the\r\nweakest links in the global chain. It respects no\r\nboundary, no race and no religion. As His Excellency\r\nGeorge W. Bush, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, rightly said in his address to the General\r\nAssembly, the victims of terrorism are also to be found\r\nin Bali, Casablanca, Dar es Salaam, Mombassa,\r\nNairobi and Baghdad. We must respond, therefore, so\r\nas to ensure that such borderless networks never gain\r\nany respite and so as to prevent cowardice from\r\nholding sway and destroying humanity.\r\nIn order to better combat this situation, we must\r\nbring terrorists to justice and commit ourselves\r\nresolutely to the long-term fight against terrorism\r\nitself. In order to do so, we must fight frustration and\r\ninjustice and appeal for greater tolerance and for\r\nrespect for the right to differ and for the right of every\r\npeople to live in dignity.\r\nIn suppressing terrorism, however, we must guard\r\nagainst any tendency to strike a blow against human\r\nrights, and refrain from equating terrorism with certain\r\nreligions or regions. Indeed, committing such a grave\r\nmistake could give rise to a vicious circle of hatred,\r\nvengeance and isolationism at the global level. My\r\ncountry is steadfastly committed to preventing and\r\ncombating terrorism in all its forms, and we have set\r\nup the necessary institutional mechanisms to this end.\r\nWe appeal for greater technical and logistical support\r\nfrom the international community to help us to be more\r\nsuccessful in this fight.\r\nAll the countries of the world  those of the\r\nNorth and South alike  have a shared destiny.\r\nCountries and peoples cannot get along without each\r\nother. Solidarity is a necessity; complementarity is an\r\nobligation. But we must recognize and reaffirm that we\r\ncannot today truly talk about security in a world of\r\npoverty. We cannot talk about peace if we do not\r\nensure the economic development and well-being of all\r\npeoples. Harmony and democracy cannot reign in the\r\nworld if it is rife with inequalities and disparities that\r\nleave entire sectors of the global population in\r\nconditions of uncertainty, precariousness and oblivion.\r\nWe have, indeed, forgotten that humankind must\r\nbe at the centre of all of our concerns. Unfortunately,\r\nthe general feeling of uncertainty  the daily fear that\r\nall of us experience  vividly brings to mind the fact\r\nthat, whatever the social status of particular\r\nindividuals, humankind is vulnerable and people need\r\neach other in order to be reassured and to survive.\r\nBut the insecurity that causes so much anxiety\r\nthroughout the world and makes it seem so fragile has\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\na number of different sources. We are entitled to ask, as\r\nwe consider the current situation, if it was wise in the\r\npast to have brought together  almost by force \r\npeople of various nationalities, given that nothing was\r\ndone to foster a common desire among them to live\r\ntogether.\r\nIt should come as no surprise, therefore, that\r\nthere are inter-ethnic problems and friction between\r\nnationalities in many States throughout the world, and\r\nthat these are a source of instability and insecurity.\r\nThat shows the seriousness of lack of respect for the\r\ndifferences and even the character of each people in the\r\nworlds harmonious development.\r\nCountries and peoples throughout the world are\r\nsearching for their integrity, their sovereignty and their\r\nidentity. Most often, of course, that generates threats to\r\npeace and security. The same causes produce the same\r\neffects everywhere. My country, the Union of the\r\nComoros  today still a victim of its colonial past \r\nis very eloquent testimony to that. But there are similar\r\ncases, particularly in China, in Morocco, in Palestine\r\nand in other regions. Under those conditions, the\r\nComorian State is experiencing  as might be the case\r\nfor any other country  all the difficulties of achieving\r\nreal development in its desire to consolidate democracy.\r\nToday, democracy and respect for human rights\r\nare requirements that must be respected by every\r\ncountry. It is universally established that democracy is\r\nthe most appropriate remedy to overcome the pain of\r\ncountries and of peoples. But it is also established that,\r\nwhatever the remedy, the dose must be prescribed\r\naccording to the patients age and physical state, and\r\nobviously one must always bear in mind the possible\r\nside effects. So we must help every country to move at\r\nits own pace on the path of democracy, while bearing\r\nin mind each peoples history and traditions.\r\nThe dialogue of cultures  openness towards the\r\nother  must be a permanent inspiration in the\r\ncommitment to a peaceful and responsible international\r\nlife. Multilateralism  which is the guarantee of\r\nparticipation by every nation in the worlds progress \r\nmust be safeguarded and strengthened. Therefore, we\r\nsupport the proposals of the Secretary-General, Mr.\r\nKofi Annan, for a restructuring of the Organization so\r\nthat it will be effective and can meet current\r\nchallenges. In that way, the moral authority of the\r\nUnited Nations will be gradually restored and\r\nmaintained. As for the Security Council  the body\r\ncharged with maintaining peace and security  it must\r\nbe reformed and its role must be fine-tuned. That is an\r\nessential condition for ensuring the success of its\r\ndiverse missions.\r\nIn its development, the world  if it is to be\r\nharmonious and stable  must concern itself with and\r\nbear in mind the most vulnerable regions and the most\r\ndisadvantaged countries. Among those, the small island\r\nStates deserve particular attention so that we can bridge\r\nthe development gap inherent to their geographical\r\nsituation. Only economic development  and thus real\r\nsolidarity between rich and poor countries  will\r\nguarantee stability and peace in the world. Thus will\r\ndemocracy and the rule of law be consolidated and\r\nstrengthened.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africas Development\r\n an ambitious project conceived in Africa by\r\nAfricans for Africans  must be a reality that is\r\nsupported by and profitable for all. Debt  which is a\r\ntrue burden and is truly stifling developing economies\r\n must be circumscribed and overcome to liberate the\r\ncountries of the South and to give them the capacity for\r\nreal involvement in global wealth creation. But, in\r\norder to support the survival and emergence of our\r\neconomies, we must also put an end to agricultural\r\nproduct subsidies in the countries of the North and let\r\nthe market have free reign. Our countries seek and\r\nneed support so that they can emerge from economic\r\nmarginalization. Our assets and our potential deserve to\r\nbe valued. Our efforts must be encouraged.\r\nMy country, which believes in Africas ability to\r\ntake charge of itself, is facing its future with\r\ndetermination and responsibility. I do not believe it is\r\nuseful to return to the ups and downs that have marked\r\nmy countrys historical development  particularly the\r\npast few years, characterized by a secessionist crisis\r\nwith tragic consequences. Today, I welcome the new-\r\nfound normality and the significant progress achieved.\r\nWe owe that success to Comorian wisdom, to the\r\nnational conscience and to the multiform assistance of\r\nall our bilateral and multilateral partners. Today, we\r\nmust still establish the Assemblies. But the Comorians\r\nare convinced that only real economic development can\r\nguarantee national cohesion and ensure a secure future.\r\nThe international communitys support is needed\r\nmore than ever before. I thank our partner countries\r\nand organizations, particularly the Republic of South\r\nAfrica and the African Union, which have always had\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nconfidence in the Comorian people and stand by them\r\nin their resolve to achieve stability and well-being for\r\nevery citizen. Together, we have an opportunity to\r\nguarantee a more just and more humane world. The\r\ninternational systems weaknesses, the blindness and\r\nthe deafness, and the ill-fated and suicidal networks\r\nmust be overcome, allowing the emergence of an\r\ninternational conscience, the guarantee of unity, peace\r\nand solidarity. The world needs each of us, every\r\ncountry and every difference, to guarantee its future.\r\nLet us commit ourselves, all together, with resolve and\r\ndetermination.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Union of\r\nthe Comoros for the statement he has just made.\r\nColonel Azali Assoumani, President of the Union\r\nof the Comoros, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Blaise Compaore, President of\r\nBurkina Faso\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the President of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso,\r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Blaise Compaore,\r\nPresident of Burkina Faso, and to invite him to address\r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Compaore (spoke in French): The\r\nserious events currently threatening international peace\r\nand security  armed conflict, terrorism, poverty,\r\ndisease and unfair trading practices  call urgently\r\nand firmly to mankinds conscience and, above all, to\r\nthat of the worlds leaders. Guided by this\r\nconsideration, I come before this Assembly to share\r\nour common concerns with the other leaders of the\r\nworld and to seek appropriate answers that will restore\r\nconfidence and hope to humankind.\r\nGiven the importance of this gathering, the\r\nelection of Mr. Hunte to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session in every way\r\nrepresents a tribute and a symbol of the honour being\r\npaid to a young and small nation, Saint Lucia. That\r\nhonour is ours as well  the honour of small States,\r\nwhich see this consecration as a demonstration of the\r\nUnited Nations awareness of the concept of the\r\nsovereign equality of States.\r\nWe extend the same sentiments to Mr. Huntes\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan.\r\nWe must recognize, however, that all of our\r\nexpectations of this session will be chimerical if we do\r\nnot fully support the activities of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I therefore wish solemnly to congratulate Mr.\r\nKofi Annan on his active commitment to the cause of\r\npeace and justice and to reaffirm our complete trust in\r\nhim and our sincere encouragement. That is particularly\r\ntrue this year because our Organization was brutally\r\ntested and unfairly harmed by the heinous attack of 19\r\nAugust on the United Nations office in Baghdad, which\r\ntook the lives of a number of staff members, including\r\nthat of the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Iraq, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. Burkina\r\nFaso once again pays tribute to their memory.\r\nThe convulsions of our times  reflected in the\r\nincreased hotbeds of crisis, the radicalization of\r\ninternational terrorism and organized crime, growing\r\npoverty and the proliferation of disease  convince us\r\nfully that international solidarity must remain active if\r\nwe are to guarantee our world the stability and security it\r\nso desires. Indeed, despite the undeniable involvement\r\nand efforts of the United Nations; regional organizations,\r\nsuch as the African Union; and subregional\r\norganizations, such as the Economic Community of\r\nWest African States, the Southern Africa Development\r\nCommunity, the Economic and Monetary Community\r\nof Central Africa and the Community of Sahel and\r\nSaharan States, to name but a few, in the management\r\nand settlement of many conflicts; and despite a certain\r\nnumber of success stories, such as the restoration of\r\npeace in Angola, Sierra Leone and more generally in\r\nthe Great Lakes region, the rolling wave of armed\r\nconflict, tension and instability threatens to become an\r\nongoing phenomenon.\r\nIn Iraq, given the tragic turn of events, we feel\r\nthat the Organization must once again be placed at the\r\nheart of the key responsibilities both in order to define\r\na transitional political process free of any taint of\r\ncolonialism and to rebuild the country.\r\nIn the Middle East, where the escalation of\r\nviolence and the intransigence of the belligerents make\r\nus fear the worst every day, we believe that the road\r\nmap offers an opportunity to emerge from this crisis.\r\nHowever, without an international body on the ground\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nto follow up and monitor events, no agreement on this\r\nmajor conflict can work.\r\nWe cannot fail to mention the situations in the\r\nCôte dIvoire, Burundi, Sudan and the Horn of Africa.\r\nThe very least that can be said about these conflicts is\r\nthat they remain of concern, despite all the efforts that\r\nhave been made to settle them. Clearly, given its\r\nhistory and geography, the political crisis in the Côte\r\ndIvoire is a major source of anxiety to us, particularly\r\nsince the events of 19 September 2002. Above and\r\nbeyond its incalculable consequences in terms of\r\nhuman lives lost, human rights violations and economic\r\nand financial damage, that serious crisis has\r\ndemonstrated the extent to which we are so heavily\r\ninterdependent in our subregion. This is yet another\r\nreason to hasten integration. We therefore deeply hope\r\nthat the Côte dIvoire will return to lasting peace as\r\nsoon as possible through the implementation of the\r\nLinas-Marcoussis Agreement.\r\nJust as worrisome is the tenacity with which\r\nterrorism harries and defies the international\r\ncommunity, while using its own protean manifestations\r\nto evade the most impressive and sophisticated arsenals\r\nset up to contain it. Given the complexity of the\r\nphenomenon and the enormous obstacles to be\r\novercome, the only valid activity is to make a\r\ncollective response to what has become a threat to\r\neveryone. In this titanic struggle, it goes without saying\r\nthat Burkina Faso is on the side of civilization against\r\nbarbarism. It is pledged to this position, subscribing\r\nwithout hesitation to the anti-terror measures of the\r\nUnited Nations, particularly the relevant resolutions of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nHowever, while anathematizing terrorists of all\r\nstripes, we must recognize that one of the sources of\r\nsuch tragedy is the despair of certain peoples, the\r\nvictims of intolerable frustration and injustice that are\r\nnot being addressed quickly enough. That is why we\r\nmust welcome the rejection by most countries in\r\nCancún of the unfair trading practices that subsidize\r\nthousands of farmers of the North while preparing the\r\ncertain deaths of millions of peasants of the South. It is\r\nalso why our claims on behalf of African cotton\r\ngrowers will intensify as the market becomes ever\r\nmore distorted. Considering that cotton production,\r\nwhich represents a tiny fraction of the economic\r\nactivity of the industrialized countries, is a key element\r\nof the poverty reduction policies and a basic factor of\r\nthe political and social stability of the States of\r\nWestern and Central Africa, it is easy to take the full\r\nmeasure of the bias to which we are subject. What is\r\ntrue for cotton is just as true for most of the\r\nagricultural products of the developing countries. We\r\nmust therefore work to redress such injustices.\r\nThe duty of solidarity in favour of development is\r\na moral duty for the countries of the North. Such\r\nsolidarity is an urgently-needed response to the\r\ndestitution of our populations, especially since it\r\naddresses peoples more than Governments. This\r\nimplies in no way that developing countries should be\r\ntaken in charge, but that they should be helped to\r\nassume responsibility for their own futures. As for\r\nAfrica, it has come to see that its salvation lies in\r\nendogenous development and has therefore decided to\r\ntake its own destiny in hand. That is the raison dêtre\r\nof the New Partnership for Africas Development, to\r\nwhich the General Assembly is to devote a high-level\r\ndebate in the near future.\r\nIt will be noted that I have a personal stake in the\r\nproblems of development. I deeply believe that\r\ndevelopment through expanded job opportunities and\r\nthe progressive elimination of poverty is a sine qua non\r\nof peace and thus of the very survival of humankind.\r\nThis conviction led me to propose that, together with\r\nthe International Labour Organization, the\r\nOrganization of African Unity  and later the African\r\nUnion  begin considering the issue of employment\r\nand the fight against poverty in Africa. A ministerial\r\nmeeting was held in Ouagadougou in April 2002 on the\r\nissue in its many manifestations with respect to job\r\ngrowth as a means of defeating poverty in Africa.\r\nConvinced that such thinking must be carried out\r\nat the highest level, the African Union at its Maputo\r\nsummit decided to convene in Ouagadougou next year\r\nin 2004 a special summit of heads of State and\r\nGovernment on that very theme. For African leaders\r\nthis will mean turning into specific and realistic\r\nprogrammes and strategies their commitments to create\r\nemployment as a good way to combat poverty in\r\nAfrica.\r\nThat meeting will be preceded by a civil society\r\nforum, through which employers and employees, non-\r\ngovernmental organizations, the African diaspora,\r\ninstitutions and development partners will make their\r\ncontributions to our collective thinking.\r\nProgress, independence and peace are intrinsic\r\nvalues of democracy. All nations and peoples are\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nworking to meet that undeniable need. For more than a\r\ndecade, Burkina Faso has been firmly rooted in the rule\r\nof law, oriented by political pluralism, good\r\ngovernance and the strength of institutions that\r\nguarantee human rights. We are pursuing this anchor of\r\ndemocracy, convinced that there is nothing more\r\nimportant at stake. This requirement should be true for\r\neveryone  peoples, nations and international\r\norganizations.\r\nThus, the long-sought reform of the United\r\nNations, with the democratization of the institution, its\r\nstructures and operations, the main goal, is becoming\r\nan imperative. It must give greater and better\r\nresponsibilities to all nations, small and large, and\r\navoid exclusion, such as those that have been against\r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan for 30 years. Nothing\r\njustifies keeping that country of 23 million inhabitants\r\nsidelined at the United Nations.\r\nWe are fully aware of the immensity and the\r\ncomplexity of the trials that disturb international life,\r\nbut they are not insurmountable. Who could doubt that,\r\ndespite such trials and pitfalls, the world could renew\r\nitself, if we were to agree to order our ambitions and\r\nefforts under the auspices of the United Nations? In\r\nthat connection, Burkina Faso, a Sahelian country,\r\naware of the continuing deterioration of the world\r\necological situation and its devastating affect on\r\ndevelopment, supports the idea of creating a\r\nspecialized United Nations body for the environment\r\npresented by President Jacques Chirac at the fifty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, the clear awareness of what is at\r\nstake for the international community and, above all,\r\nthe commitment we have undertaken to protect future\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, hunger and\r\nilliteracy, are also factors that auger a more peaceful\r\nand equitable society. We believe that, in that sign of\r\nhope and perseverance, we should always and\r\neverywhere direct our action.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Burkina\r\nFaso for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso,\r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Honourable Pierre Charles,\r\nPrime Minister of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica.\r\nMr. Pierre Charles, Prime Minister of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted to the\r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Honourable Pierre\r\nCharles, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Pierre Charles (Dominica): Allow me to\r\nstart by congratulating you warmly, Mr. President, on\r\nyour election to the high post of President of this\r\nrespected global forum and to wish you success during\r\nyour tenure. Your election to the post of President of\r\nthe General Assembly is indeed an honour and a source\r\nof pride for all Saint Lucians, as well as for your\r\nbrothers and sisters in the Organization of East\r\nCaribbean States (OECS), the Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM) and Latin America.\r\nYour presidency is, as such, a CARICOM-Latin\r\nAmerican presidency, and your record of prudence and\r\ndiplomatic skills will certainly be instrumental in\r\nmeeting the lofty goals sought commonly by all of our\r\nnations and peoples.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate your\r\npredecessor, His Excellency Jan Kavan, for the\r\nleadership he provided to the fifty-seventh session of\r\nthe General Assembly, a session that brought out\r\nclearly the many challenges confronting the United\r\nNations in this decade.\r\nThe delegation of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica assures you of its full cooperation and\r\nsupport. Profound appreciation is also due to our\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless\r\nefforts to make the United Nations more responsive\r\nand effective.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nOver the last nine months, the relevance of the\r\nUnited Nations has become a burning issue worldwide.\r\nWe must all appreciate that it remains the only\r\nuniversal multilateral institution with the capacity to\r\naddress the complex set of global problems of the\r\ntwenty-first century, ranging from peace and security to\r\ndevelopment.\r\nTodays world is entangled in a web of complex\r\nproblems that threaten global security. These problems,\r\nwhich require the urgent attention of the United\r\nNations, include HIV/AIDS and other diseases,\r\npoverty, the marginalization of indigenous people,\r\nterrorism and global crime, the growing scarcity of\r\nfreshwater, global warming, the spread of light arms,\r\nwhich threaten peaceful countries like Dominica,\r\nnuclear proliferation, armed civil conflicts and the\r\nrefugees they give rise to, trafficking in humans and\r\nunfair trade rules that contribute to growing poverty in\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nAll of these problems require a strong and\r\neffective multilateral organization, which enjoys the\r\ntrust and confidence of the people on this planet and is\r\ncapable of articulating collective approaches towards\r\nsome solutions.\r\nThe world has changed considerably, yet present\r\ninstitutions for global governance  the United Nations,\r\nthe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the\r\nWorld Trade Organization  continue to operate on\r\noutdated political and economic foundations. The\r\nlegitimacy, effectiveness and credibility of the United\r\nNations continue to erode in the face of the\r\ndemocratic deficit, which was an integral part of the\r\noriginal design but which needs to be remedied now.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council and the\r\nGeneral Assembly is indispensable to the restoration of\r\nthe moral authority lost because of failure to enforce\r\nresolutions. Effective governance, predicated on the\r\nprinciples of accountability and transparency to the\r\npeople of the Member States, is a highly desirable\r\nobjective that we must strive for.\r\nI wish to reaffirm our countrys total commitment\r\nto, and support for, the United Nations.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, other staff members of the United\r\nNations and the citizens of Iraq who lost their lives or\r\nsustained injuries in the tragedy of Baghdad last\r\nAugust. We share the sorrow of the Secretary-General\r\nand his staff, and extend our heartfelt condolences to\r\nthe bereaved families.\r\nThe return of peace and stability to Iraq has now\r\nbecome the responsibility of all States members of the\r\ninternational community. If the international community\r\nmust accept and shoulder this important responsibility,\r\nthen we must commit to a greater role for the United\r\nNations. We strongly hold the view that stability in Iraq\r\nis inextricably linked to the transfer of sovereignty to\r\nthe Iraqis, who must have sole responsibility for their\r\nfuture. The coalition forces must give a clear mandate\r\nto the United Nations for the creation of a\r\nmultinational force, led of course by the main troop\r\ncontributors, in order to ensure the security of Iraq.\r\nWhile the attention of the international\r\ncommunity is focused on restoring peace and security\r\nin Iraq, we cannot turn a blind eye to the breakdown in\r\nthe Middle East peace process. My delegation supports\r\nthe road map for peace in the Middle East and calls for\r\nthe removal of the obstacles that have stalled the\r\nprocess. We embrace the two-State solution as the only\r\nmechanism for a lasting peace in the Middle East. The\r\nState of Israel and the Palestinian Authority must both\r\ncommit to a ceasefire and return to the agreed\r\nobligations under the road map framework.\r\nThe fight against international terrorism remains\r\na priority for Dominica given the horror of 11\r\nSeptember. In that regard, we have taken many steps to\r\ncomply with the obligations of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001). This year our Parliament\r\nenacted the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Act,\r\nwhich complements two earlier pieces of legislation\r\nrelated to the prevention of terrorism, the Money\r\nLaundering Act and the Exchange of Information Act.\r\nThe passage of these pieces of legislation has contributed\r\nto significant strengthening of the regulatory regime for\r\nbanks operating in our offshore financial sector and to\r\nefforts to combat money-laundering.\r\nWe welcome the assistance of the Commonwealth\r\nin a review of our legal system to allow its alignment\r\nwith the global strategy to fight terrorism, as well as\r\nthe guidance of the Counter-Terrorism Committee.\r\nThe numerous terrorist actions this year in\r\nIndonesia, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Iraq\r\nunderscore the central importance of being vigilant and\r\nprepared to manage any crisis from a terrorist attack.\r\nWe appeal to Member States to continue collaborative\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nefforts in this global fight to combat terrorism and to\r\nensure that the capacities of small States are enhanced\r\nthrough transfer of intelligence information, surveillance\r\ntechnology and training in prevention strategies.\r\nThe United Nations International Year of\r\nFreshwater has helped the world community to focus\r\nattention on the millions of poor people who lack\r\naccess to clean sources of water. Dominica is one of\r\nthe islands in the Caribbean blessed with abundant\r\nfreshwater resources, largely thanks to our high\r\nrainfall. Our experience with conserving our mountains\r\nand forests, which contribute to the maintenance of the\r\nwater table, is one of the many experiences that our\r\npeople are prepared to share with the world community.\r\nMankind faces a great challenge as growing\r\nscarcity of freshwater becomes a reality of this century.\r\nThis is clearly an arena for constructive global action\r\nby the United Nations. Let us hope that concern for and\r\nattention to freshwater remain a core part of our\r\ncontinuing commitment to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nMy delegation is indeed pleased at the\r\ntremendous progress made by the International\r\nCriminal Court over the last year. We have moved one\r\nstep closer to punishing war crimes, genocide, and\r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nThis year is an important year for the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica because we are\r\ncelebrating the silver jubilee of our political\r\nindependence, as well our twenty-fifth anniversary of\r\nour membership in the United Nations. Twenty-five\r\nyears of nation-building has given us some experience\r\nin the global arena and allowed us to build a foundation\r\nfor the next 25 years of national development.\r\nAs a peace-loving people, we highly value the\r\nright to self-determination and the full, fair and\r\nunhindered expression of the will of the people. We\r\nreaffirm our commitment to the rule of law, good\r\ngovernance at all levels and deepening of our\r\nlongstanding democratic tradition.\r\nDominica and its sister islands of Saint Lucia,\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and\r\nJamaica are island nations adversely affected by the\r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) banana regime,\r\nwhich will bring to an end preferences and quotas for\r\nbananas exported to the European Union. The\r\nimpending abolition of the banana quota at the end of\r\n2005 has contributed immensely to an economic crisis\r\nin these Caribbean Community States. Thousands of\r\nsmall farmers in these island nations have lost hope\r\nand left banana production altogether. This has led to a\r\n60 per cent decline in banana export earnings and has a\r\nnegative impact on our national savings.\r\nIn Dominica, this situation has necessitated the\r\nimplementation of an austerity program, in tandem\r\nwith a standby agreement with the International\r\nMonetary Fund. We are, however, working assiduously\r\nto create the conditions for economic revitalization and\r\ntransformation.\r\nAs we struggle to eradicate the mono-crop nature\r\nof our economy, a remaining vestige of the colonial\r\nperiod, we are determined to anchor our future\r\neconomic foundation in the following areas:\r\nsustainable agriculture, renewable energy, ecotourism,\r\ninformation technology, financial services and water\r\nresource management. Our resolve to build a new\r\neconomic order is based on our assertion of the\r\nprinciple of responsibility for our own development.\r\nOur efforts at economic re-engineering urgently\r\nrequire a complement of new foreign direct investment,\r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) transfers,\r\ntechnology transfer and deepening of cooperation with\r\nMember States and global civil society. We remain\r\nhopeful that our donor partners will soon translate the\r\nODA commitments that they made at Monterrey last\r\nyear into action, since these commitments have become\r\ncritical for economic reconstruction throughout the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nOur call for special and differential treatment in\r\nthe trade arena continues to resonate loudly. The\r\noutcome of the WTO meeting in Cancún was not\r\nencouraging. We join other developing nations in the\r\ncall for an end or drastic reduction of agricultural\r\nsubsidies in the developed world.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to commend the\r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\r\nfor organizing the high-level plenary meeting with\r\nrespect to the implementation of the Declaration of\r\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS, which took place on\r\nMonday, 22 September. This meeting will only be\r\nsuccessful if it renews the resolve of Member States to\r\naccord a higher priority to national integrated efforts to\r\nfight the disease, which is exacting a toll on the youth\r\nand adult populations of African and Caribbean\r\nnations.\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica has developed a\r\nfive-year plan of action to guide our efforts to manage\r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, and we are increasing our\r\nefforts to ensure a coordinated and participatory\r\nnational response that involves schoolchildren,\r\nworkers, the private sector and the voluntary sector.\r\nI also wish to acknowledge the great initiative of\r\nPresident George W. Bush for the global fight against\r\nHIV/AIDS. It is a bold and assertive commitment that\r\nwill contribute much-needed financial resources for the\r\nglobal campaign, particularly in Africa and the\r\nCaribbean. I also want to pay tribute to the tremendous\r\nefforts of UNAIDS, the United Nations Development\r\nFund for Women, the United Nations Childrens Fund\r\nand the World Health Organization/Pan-American\r\nHealth Organization in HIV/AIDS prevention. The\r\nprogrammes of these United Nations organizations\r\ndeserve additional resources from Member States,\r\ninternational financial institutions, private foundations\r\nand transnational corporations if we are to expect\r\nhigher levels of effectiveness and greater positive\r\noutcomes in HIV/AIDS prevention.\r\nIn 2004, the Decade of the Worlds Indigenous\r\nPeople will come to an end. The Decade was important\r\nin that it highlighted, for the first time since Columbus\r\ncame to the Americas, the marginalization of the\r\nworlds indigenous people. Although the Decade has\r\nfallen far short of expectations, it did have one positive\r\noutcome, namely, greater awareness on the part of the\r\ninternational community about the continuing plight of\r\nthe indigenous peoples of the world. Dominicas\r\nindigenous people, the Caribs, made some important\r\ngains during the decade. These include the building of\r\nlinks with other indigenous groups across continents,\r\nthe consolidation of a Caribbean grouping of\r\nindigenous organizations, and the Governments\r\nestablishment of a Department of Carib Affairs.\r\nIndigenous peoples around the world continue to\r\nface marginalization and to wallow in abject poverty.\r\nThe world community must demonstrate greater\r\nresponsiveness to improving their condition through\r\nmore generous contributions to the Voluntary Fund.\r\nWe welcome the first report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the New Partnership for African\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) and we are greatly encouraged\r\nby the number of African actions to institutionalize\r\nNEPAD along with the incremental steps towards\r\nalignment of United Nations activities with the\r\npriorities of NEPAD. We commend the African Union\r\nand the African nations for all the efforts towards\r\nstrengthening the organizations momentum.\r\nDominica reiterates its continuing support for the\r\nefforts of our brothers and sisters in Africa to take full\r\nresponsibility for their own development.\r\nNext August, the international meeting for the 10-\r\nyear review of the Barbados Programme of Action\r\nregarding the sustainable development of Small Island\r\nDeveloping States will be held in Mauritius. This\r\nmeeting will address the future of the worlds small\r\nisland developing States and will be a momentous\r\noccasion for Dominica and all the members of the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) to finally get\r\nthe much-needed international support to address the\r\nrange of vulnerabilities we confront.\r\nDominica is honoured to host next week a\r\nmeeting of sustainable development experts, who will\r\nassess the performance of the indicators of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action. The Mauritius\r\nConference is especially important given the\r\nmarginalization of small island developing States by\r\nunfavourable World Trade Organization (WTO) trade\r\nrules and the trade liberalization process.\r\nThe international community must pay greater\r\nattention to the social and economic vulnerabilities\r\nfaced by small island developing States. The sudden\r\nadjustment to trade liberalization and the WTO trade\r\nregime has contributed to the economic decline in\r\nmany small island States. Averting the rapid descent\r\ninto a downward economic spiral and social dislocation\r\nin SIDS requires a wider embrace and understanding of\r\nour call for special and differential treatment in the\r\ntrade arena.\r\nThe Dominican delegation believes that we have\r\nan obligation to be responsible to future generations by\r\nensuring that they will have an earth that is safe, secure\r\nand can sustain life. Let us not forget the commitments\r\nwe made last year at the World Summit for Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, especially regarding small island\r\ndeveloping States. We reiterate our concern once again\r\nabout all manifestations of climate change, and our\r\nopposition to continuing trans-shipment of nuclear\r\nwaste through the Caribbean Sea.\r\nWe therefore call on all Member States to support\r\nand participate in the Mauritius Conference for the 10-\r\nyear review of the Barbados Programme of Action next\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nAugust. We also appeal to corporations, private\r\nfoundations, bilateral and multilateral organizations to\r\nlend support for significant participation of civil\r\nsociety organizations, particularly from the AOSIS\r\nmember States, at this conference.\r\nThe delegation of the Commonwealth of\r\nDominica wishes once again to address the\r\nparticipation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the\r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\nTaiwan has demonstrated its willingness to\r\nprovide much needed assistance to countries around the\r\nworld, including relief to war-torn and devastated\r\ncountries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Article 4 of the\r\nUnited Nations Charter invites all other peace-loving\r\nStates to join the Organization and compels us to consider\r\nthe participation of Taiwans 23 million people.\r\nThe problem of Severe Acute Respiratory\r\nSyndrome (SARS) ably demonstrated that progress\r\ntowards the noble goals of the United Nations is only\r\nimpeded by not integrating the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan into international efforts to confront global\r\nchallenges. The situation regarding the Republic of\r\nChina must be addressed to ensure a more meaningful\r\ncontribution to global peace, security and poverty\r\neradication.\r\nIn conclusion, Dominica repeats its call for a new\r\nglobal framework to redress the imbalances brought\r\nabout by the galloping forces of globalization. We urge\r\nthe international community to rally behind the banner\r\nof multilateralism and to support the bold initiative of\r\nGeneral Assembly President Julian Hunte to make\r\ndevelopment and its attendant components, poverty\r\neradication and the Millennium Development Goals,\r\nthe central focus of the fifty-eighth session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe call also for the leadership role of the United\r\nNations in the quest for peaceful resolution to the\r\nconflicts in Iraq, Liberia and the Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo, and for the unwavering support of the\r\ninternational community to the special needs of the\r\nsmall island developing States.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica for the statement just\r\nmade.\r\nThe Honourable Pierre Charles, Prime Minister\r\nof the Commonwealth of Dominica, was escorted\r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bernard Makuza, Prime\r\nMinister of the Rwandese Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of the\r\nRwandese Republic.\r\nMr. Bernard Makuza, Prime Minister of the\r\nRwandese Republic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Bernard Makuza, Prime\r\nMinister of the Rwandese Republic and inviting him to\r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Makuza (Rwanda) (spoke in French): This\r\nsession of the General Assembly is being held at a time\r\nwhen the world is confronted with the most serious\r\nchallenges of its history in all areas.\r\nThe Assembly has chosen Mr. Julian Hunte to\r\npreside over our work and for my delegation it is a sign\r\nof recognition of his qualities and competence. I would\r\ntherefore like to join my voice to those of other\r\ndistinguished heads of delegations preceding me in\r\nconveying to him my sincere congratulations as well as\r\nmy hopes for his complete success, and we pledge to\r\nhim the support of my country to assist him in\r\naccomplishing his task. We also wish to pay a tribute to\r\nhis predecessor, whose success was tremendous in\r\nconducting the work of the fifty-seventh session, which\r\nhas just ended. We ask him to accept our\r\ncongratulations and our gratitude and we hope he will\r\ncontinue to impart to us the benefits of his experience.\r\nWe would also like to respectfully convey our\r\nthanks to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, for the\r\nwisdom that he has shown and for his tireless efforts\r\nwhich he continues to deploy, sometimes in extremely\r\ndifficult situations, so that the Organization can, as\r\nmuch as possible, reach the objectives which have been\r\nassigned to it under the terms of its Charter.\r\nDuring this fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly, we are going to commemorate the tenth\r\nanniversary of the genocide which, in less than 100\r\ndays, from April to July 1994, in plain sight of the\r\nentire world, claimed the lives of more than a million\r\nRwandans and caused the internal displacement or the\r\nexile of thousands of others. We hope that this will be\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nan occasion for the General Assembly to collectively\r\nrecommit our efforts, as Governments and peoples\r\nacross the globe, so that these types of horrors never\r\nagain occur. Toward this end, we suggest that 7 April\r\n2004 be declared, by this distinguished Assembly, as a\r\nday to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the\r\nRwandan genocide.\r\nWhile the advent of this sad anniversary obliges\r\nus to recall this genocide as something we must remember\r\nand as a sign of respect and of international solidarity, it\r\nis not the only reason we have taken the floor here. On\r\nthe contrary, we wish to share an experience which is\r\nvery hopeful, namely the rebirth of the Rwandan nation\r\nwhich, in our opinion, has been a test of stamina and of\r\nthe determination of an entire people. In fact, in the last\r\nfive months Rwanda, which in 1994 looked very much\r\nlike a failed State, courageously undertook its\r\nreconstruction and now has experienced some\r\npromising events, the most promising of its post-\r\ncolonial history.\r\nSince its accession to independence in 1962, the\r\nfirst pluralist presidential elections have just been held\r\nand they took place in an atmosphere of unprecedented\r\npeace and calm. The stunning victory of His\r\nExcellency Paul Kagame as President of the Republic\r\nin the vote that was held on 25 August, exactly one\r\nmonth ago, is part of the democratic process set in\r\nmotion since 1999 by local elections, followed in 2001\r\nby municipal elections and in May 2003 by the\r\nconstitutional referendum. This marks, de jure, the end\r\nof the transitional period, begun in the aftermath of the\r\nRwandan tragedy in 1994.\r\nThese free and transparent elections, as well as\r\nthe legislative elections which are ongoing even now as\r\nwe speak, are not only an important step in the process\r\nof democratization, but also and especially are\r\nrestoring Rwandans to their right and sense of pride at\r\nbeing able to make and write their own history, a\r\nhistory, which has turned its back forever on genocide\r\nand which is instituting, as critical values and objectives,\r\nunity, peace, justice, democracy and development.\r\nThese consultations, we are reminded, are not the\r\nresult of chance, and would not have taken place nor\r\nknown as much success as the international community\r\nhas seen, had it not been for the firm will of the\r\nRwandan leadership and the Rwandan people to\r\ncommit themselves with determination to peace and\r\nsecurity of individuals and property throughout the\r\nentire Rwandan territory; unity and reconciliation of\r\nthe Rwandan people; and good governance which, in\r\nthe end, is our policy engine and which has allowed us\r\nto dismantle the structure of a State that was too\r\ncentralized and totalitarian and which stifled positive\r\ninitiatives, as well as the involvement of the people in\r\ndecisions concerning their own development.\r\nWe have also set up principles of accountability\r\nand transparency at all levels of public life by creating\r\nstrong autonomous institutions to combat corruption,\r\nnepotism and abuses of power. The success of these\r\ninitiatives can be measured today by the fact that a\r\nrecent study of the World Bank Institute has cited\r\nRwanda among the developing countries that are the\r\nbest managed, the best governed and not corrupt. Such\r\npublic transparency would not have been possible\r\nwithout our having eradicated the culture of impunity\r\nwhich had taken root in our country.\r\nWe had to take steps to completely overhaul the\r\nclassical legal system and introduce a legal system that\r\nis participatory and traditional called Gacaca, which\r\nis inspired by Rwandan know-how and whose major\r\nobjective is not only to punish crimes committed\r\nduring the genocide, but also, and especially, to\r\nreconcile Rwandans.\r\nIt should also be pointed out that the 1948\r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the\r\nCrime of Genocide obliges the international community\r\nto prevent, stop and punish genocide. While the\r\ninternational community came up short in its obligations\r\nunder this Convention, we did greatly appreciate the\r\nsubsequent establishment of the International Criminal\r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), established to bring to\r\njustice and punish the perpetrators of this crime.\r\nOur country was particularly pleased and satisfied\r\nwith the recent decision of the Security Council to\r\nappoint a full-time prosecutor for the ICTR in order to\r\nimprove its performance and its effectiveness. We are\r\nof the view, however, that other reforms could still be\r\ninitiated to obtain this objective which, in our view,\r\nwould help restore human dignity.\r\nRegionally, the political and security situation in\r\nthe Great Lakes Region in Central Africa has tangibly\r\nimproved since last year. Rwanda is pleased with the\r\nongoing peace process in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, which has led to the formation of an\r\ninclusive transitional Government and the reunification\r\nof that country.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nWe are disposed to work with this new\r\nGovernment, as well as with the United Nations\r\nOrganization Mission in the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo (MONUC), to achieve disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and effective repatriation, as called for\r\nin the Agreements of Lusaka and Pretoria, of the ex-\r\nFAR and the Interahamwe militia, whose belligerent\r\nactivities are at the heart of the two regrettable clashes\r\nbetween our two countries.\r\nWith respect to the situation in Burundi, this\r\nrequires more attention on the part of the international\r\ncommunity. Rwanda, at this point, is calling on all the\r\nparties to consider the best interests of the Burundians\r\nand to join with the ongoing peace initiatives supported\r\nby countries in the region so that we can put an end to\r\nthe unspeakable suffering of the Burundian population.\r\nThis being the case, at a time when these different\r\nAfrican peace initiatives are beginning to take form, it\r\nis time to call on the international community to\r\naccompany them and support organizing an\r\ninternational conference for peace, security and\r\ndevelopment in the Great Lakes region. This\r\nconference would hopefully produce a kind of Marshall\r\nPlan for the development of the region.\r\nElsewhere in Africa and throughout the world,\r\nRwanda condemns the fact that conflicts, often\r\nconflicts that have been going on for some years,\r\ncontinue to claim many human lives and deflect\r\nenormous financial and material resources that could\r\nbe allocated to developmental projects.\r\nWe are of the view, however, that these conflicts\r\nwill not disappear on their own, unless we pay\r\nattention to them and unless we attack the root causes\r\nof these conflicts and, in particular, unless we put into\r\nplace effective and appropriate mechanisms to prevent,\r\nmanage and resolve these conflicts.\r\nIndeed, we must all work together, resolutely, to\r\npromote dialogue in good faith, solidarity among nations,\r\nnon-exclusion, the human dimension, international law\r\nand diplomatic activities as a means worthy of the\r\nindividual and of nations to resolve their differences.\r\nThe point concerning United Nations reform is on\r\nthe agenda of our Organization and has been for\r\nseveral years, although we have never been able to\r\nagree on the scope and content of the necessary\r\nreforms. That the United Nations needs to be reformed\r\nis without doubt. In fact, as the United Nations\r\nSecretary-General indicated, when the stakes change,\r\nwe must adapt our responses to them.\r\nIt is certain that the challenges facing the\r\ninternational community today are different from those\r\nthey faced from the 1940s to the 1980s. Rwanda is also\r\nconvinced, therefore, that the institutions, the\r\nstructures and the working methods of the United\r\nNations, which have been adopted over the years must\r\nbe adjusted and fine-tuned to the realities of the day.\r\nWould it not be fair, for example, in a world\r\nwhich has fundamentally changed, that we question the\r\nmembership and the decision-making methods in the\r\nSecurity Council? At a time when we are requiring all\r\nnations to have democratic governance, is it not\r\nlegitimate to require the Security Council itself to be\r\nmore representative and more democratic in its\r\nmethods of work?\r\nRwanda supports the proposal submitted by other\r\nMember States to increase the number of members of\r\nthe Security Council to better reflect regional realities\r\nand therefore to allow a better representation of\r\ndeveloping countries. Nevertheless, in order to do that,\r\nwe must bear in mind the fact that the Security Council\r\nhas been placed as a body under the General Assembly\r\nand that its enlargement can in no way compromise\r\nthat order.\r\nWe must therefore better reorganize the United\r\nNations so that it can achieve the goals of ensuring\r\npeace and security among nations, developing more\r\nequitable international relations in the areas of\r\ncooperation and friendly ties and inspiring and\r\nguaranteeing the international order and international\r\nlaw. In doing so we must ask ourselves why the United\r\nNations has been unable to respond collectively and\r\neffectively to such recent crises and tragedies as the\r\n1994 Rwandan genocide and the situation in Iraq. Why\r\nhas the United Nations been unable to prevent or stop\r\nvarious crises throughout the world or to fulfil its\r\nprimary mission of ensuring peaceful co-existence among\r\nnations? Why has the United Nations been unable to be an\r\neffective and efficient catalyst for harmonious political,\r\nsocial and economic development in all nations? We\r\nbelieve that the answer to all of those questions, and\r\nmany others, will determine the nature and scope of the\r\nreforms to be undertaken. In that regard, we welcome\r\nthe Secretary-Generals decision to establish a high-\r\nlevel panel to address the question of reform and to\r\nmake proposals to the General Assembly.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nAs I said at the beginning of my statement, the\r\nmajor challenges in the world today include poverty;\r\npoor governance; economic, political and social\r\ninjustice  which give rise to many internal conflicts\r\n international terrorism; globalization and the\r\nHIV/AIDS pandemic and other widespread diseases.\r\nThose challenges cannot be successfully addressed\r\nwithout greater and more effective cooperation on the\r\npart of all countries. Nevertheless, the development\r\ngoals for the new millennium, the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development, the current series of\r\nnegotiations in the Doha round to allow greater access\r\nto world markets for products from developing\r\ncountries, the recent decision by the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) to allow poor countries to import\r\nlow-cost basic generic medicines to combat such\r\nillnesses as AIDS, and the various tools established by\r\nthe United Nations to combat international terrorism all\r\nrepresent the beginning of collective responses to those\r\nchallenges. However, those initiatives will only bear\r\nfruit if all nations abandon selfish reflexes, such as\r\nthose that were at the heart of the recent failure of\r\nWTO negotiations at Cancún.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nRwanda would like to take advantage of this\r\nforum to reiterate its steadfast determination to commit\r\nitself and to contribute, however modestly, to address\r\nthose challenges. We are committed to working with all\r\nthe nations of the world to begin that undertaking in\r\nour region and in our dear continent, Africa.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRwandese Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bernard Makuza, Prime Minister of the\r\nRwandese Republic, was escorted from the\r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Solomon Ekuma\r\nDominic Berewa, Vice-President of the Republic\r\nof Sierra Leone\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Vice-President of the Republic of Sierra\r\nLeone.\r\nMr. Solomon Ekuma Dominic Berewa, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Solomon Ekuma Dominic Berewa,\r\nVice-President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, and\r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Berewa (Sierra Leone): My delegation\r\nwishes to congratulate you very warmly, Mr. President,\r\non your assumption of the presidency of the world\r\nbody, and to assure you of its unflinching and\r\ncontinued support for a successful tenure. We would\r\nalso like to extend our appreciation to your predecessor\r\nfor successfully directing the affairs of the General\r\nAssembly during one of the most trying periods in the\r\nrecent history of the United Nations.\r\nOn 19 August 2003, the United Nations was\r\nshocked to its foundations by a fatal bomb attack on its\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad. On behalf of my President\r\nand the Government and people of Sierra Leone, I extend\r\nour deepest condolences to the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the United Nations family and the families of all\r\nthose who perished in that attack. They died for the cause\r\nof peace and humanity and for the values and\r\naspirations that the United Nations symbolizes.\r\nWe call on all members of the United Nations and\r\non other nations to spare no measures to respect the\r\nsanctity of the United Nations, because it is only when\r\nthat sanctity is respected that the United Nations can\r\nfulfil its responsibilities to mankind.\r\nThe majority of the worlds poor and deprived\r\npeople live in Africa, bedevilled by hunger, disease,\r\nmass illiteracy, ignorance, civil conflict, extreme\r\npoverty, bad governance, abuses of human rights,\r\ninadequate educational opportunities, gender\r\ninequality, environmental hazards, poor transport and\r\ncommunications facilities and debt. The New\r\nPartnership for Africas Development (NEPAD)\r\nembodies the vision of Africans themselves to rid their\r\ncontinent of those perils and to enjoy a standard of\r\nliving befitting the twenty-first century. Those goals\r\nare also in consonance with the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals of the Millennium Declaration. My\r\ndelegation believes that the world will be a better,\r\nhappier, more tolerant and peaceful place if the goals\r\nof those two impressive declarations are attained.\r\nWe also believe that to achieve those goals, we\r\nhave to come down from the lofty platform of rhetoric\r\nto the practical reality of sincere, honest and sacrificial\r\npartnership and collaboration between the haves and\r\nthe have-nots. Tangible result is the acid-test of the\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nsincerity and honesty of that partnership and\r\ncollaboration. My delegation wishes to reaffirm Sierra\r\nLeones commitment to the pursuance of the goals of\r\nthose two development blueprints as the most credible\r\nand realistic channels of, and guidelines for,\r\naccelerated development.\r\nBut we, the poor countries, execute those\r\nlaudable blueprints with great trepidation, because of\r\nthe devastating effect of the dreadful HIV/AIDS\r\nepidemic, which, without universal effort, is bound to\r\ncancel out, and even reverse, all development gains. In\r\nthe light of that, my delegation proposes that\r\nantiretroviral drugs be made available as a matter of\r\nhuman right to everyone everywhere who may need it.\r\nSierra Leone has in recent years repeatedly\r\nreiterated its faith in the United Nations as the only\r\nOrganization that can hold the crisis-ridden world\r\ntogether. My delegation wishes to reaffirm that faith,\r\nwhich is built on the conviction that collective action is\r\nthe strength of the Organization. As we are all aware,\r\ndeviating from the principle of collective action can\r\nsubject the United Nations to tremendous strain; it can\r\neven hamstring the Organization, leaving us a weak\r\nand divided family. My delegation calls upon all\r\nnations  big and small, rich and poor  to uphold\r\nthat principle as the Organizations driving force.\r\nThe unity of purpose and collective action of the\r\nUnited Nations are even more imperative in the context\r\nof the ever-increasing demands placed upon it by the\r\nnumerous conflicts and humanitarian crises to which it\r\nhas to respond. The expansion and complexity of those\r\nchallenges reinforce the need for collaboration and\r\npartnership with continental and regional organizations\r\nsuch as the African Union and the Economic Community\r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) to resolve crises. It is\r\nthe considered view of my delegation that such\r\ncollaboration and partnership, designed and financially\r\nand materially facilitated, can respond to conflicts and\r\nother crises much more speedily and productively than\r\ncan a distant and overstretched United Nations alone.\r\nWe are of the firm conviction that the hundreds of\r\nthousands of lives that have been lost in the West\r\nAfrican subregion, especially in Sierra Leone and Liberia,\r\nwould have been saved if such a functional relationship,\r\npredicated on proactive conflict prevention, had existed\r\nbetween the United Nations and ECOWAS.\r\nTwo of the most worrying challenges to peace are\r\nterrorism and the proliferation of arms, including\r\nweapons of mass destruction. We unreservedly deplore\r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and we\r\nreaffirm our commitment to resolving differences and\r\nconflicts through non-violent means. The proliferation\r\nof small arms in the West African subregion is of\r\nspecial concern to Sierra Leone. While a multi-pronged\r\nstrategy to rid the country of small weapons, including\r\nan arms-for-development project spearheaded by the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, has yielded\r\nencouraging and hopeful results, we believe that only a\r\nconcerted regional approach that includes genuine and\r\nselfless political will can eliminate that scourge from\r\nthe region.\r\nThe Government and people of Sierra Leone have\r\naccepted the challenge to recover from the scourge of\r\nthe war and to rejoin the path of development.\r\nAccordingly, a comprehensive national recovery\r\nprogramme has been designed to respond to post-\r\nconflict rehabilitation and reconstruction needs and to\r\nlay the foundations to address the issues that generated\r\nthe conflict.\r\nA priority component of the recovery process is\r\nthe consolidation of democratic governance.\r\nPreparations for nation-wide local government\r\nelections are in the ultimate stages. We attach\r\nconsiderable significance to those elections, because\r\nthey will constitute a major step in the process of\r\ndecentralization, around which the scheme of our\r\nparticipatory governance is going to revolve.\r\nIn order to tackle some of the root causes that\r\ncreated the wedge between the people and successive\r\nGovernments, which partly caused the conflict, we\r\nhave embarked on a fundamental governance reform\r\nprogramme that involves the judiciary, public service,\r\nhuman rights, accountability and transparency, local\r\ngovernment and tackling corruption and abuse of power.\r\nWe have made remarkable progress in the area of\r\nsecurity, which is the prerequisite for our national\r\nrevival and development. An international military\r\nadvisory and training team led by the United Kingdom\r\nhas provided training that has considerably enhanced\r\nthe professional competence of our armed forces. With\r\nthat training has come renewed confidence in the\r\narmed forces, as indicated by the nationwide\r\ndeployment of personnel. With support from the\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom, our police force\r\nhas also been trained, restructured and equipped to\r\ncarry out its responsibilities. But with war anywhere in\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nthe subregion, Sierra Leone never feels safe and secure.\r\nThat is why we welcome, with profound appreciation\r\nto ECOWAS and the United Nations, the initiative to\r\nput the region on a path to peace.\r\nWhile welcoming the relief provided by positive\r\ndevelopments in the Liberian peace process, my\r\ndelegation feels that we are duty bound to urge the\r\ninternational community to never again fall into\r\ncomplacency about conflicts, as it did in the case of\r\nLiberia.\r\nMy delegation is very conscious of the heavy\r\ninvestment of the United Nations and the international\r\ncommunity, which has yielded the peace Sierra Leone\r\nnow enjoys. The momentum to consolidate the hard-\r\nwon peace and embark on a meaningful course of\r\ndevelopment is our highest priority. That is why we\r\nwhole-heartedly welcome the Security Councils\r\nprogramme for the phased withdrawal of the United\r\nNations Mission in Sierra Leone, which is based on the\r\ncapacity of our security forces to discharge their\r\nfunctions and on the overall security environment in\r\nSierra Leone and the subregion.\r\nI am happy to report that the re-establishment of\r\ncivil authority throughout the country has been one of\r\nour major post-conflict accomplishments. Legal and\r\njudicial law-enforcement administrations have been\r\nreactivated in parts of the country that were previously\r\nunder rebel occupation, and schools and health\r\nfacilities, along with better social facilities, are being\r\nrehabilitated and reopened.\r\nOn the economic front, the certificate of origin\r\nregime for the export of diamonds is producing\r\npositive results, as proceeds from the sale of diamonds\r\ncontinue to rise steadily. New areas of alluvial diamond\r\ndeposits have been discovered, and prospecting for\r\nkimberlite deposits continues. Various regulatory\r\nprocedures, including legislation and expert advice, are\r\nin the pipeline to curtail illegal exploitation and to\r\nensure that Sierra Leoneans derive the benefit they\r\ndeserve from that resource.\r\nTwo transitional bodies  the Special Court to\r\ntry those who bear the greatest responsibility for the\r\nhuman rights excesses in the war, and the Truth and\r\nReconciliation Commission that was set up for victims\r\nand perpetrators of abuses to tell their stories, thereby\r\nlaying the foundation for healing, reconciliation and\r\nforgiveness  are on course to achieve their\r\nobjectives.\r\nThe future of 57,000 ex-combatants is a major\r\nfactor in the management of the costly peace that is so\r\nrelished today in Sierra Leone. The process of re-\r\nabsorbing those people into society as law-abiding,\r\npeaceful, productive and patriotic citizens has been\r\nslow, tedious and expensive. But we have had to\r\nattempt that character transformation exercise as a\r\nconflict-relapse prevention mechanism. With that\r\nreorientation, our governance reform programme and\r\nour sound youth policy, which makes ex-combatants\r\nand other young people stakeholders in society, the\r\npossibility of resorting to violence and destruction as\r\nthe only way to vent grievances and resolve conflict\r\nhas been reduced.\r\nOur other area of grave concern is the welfare of\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of children who missed\r\nopportunities for education because of the war. The\r\nmagnitude of the problem is such that we have had to\r\nform a special commission for war-affected children.\r\nLet me conclude by reassuring the United Nations\r\nthat the heavy investment in peace in Sierra Leone has\r\nnot gone, and will never go, in vain. We are determined\r\nto do whatever we can to protect and consolidate the\r\npeace for which we have all sacrificed so much. We\r\nfully recognize our responsibility as the model of\r\nsuccess for United Nations peacekeeping. We wish to\r\ngive the same reassurances to our many friends for\r\ntheir wonderful contributions in various forms over the\r\nyears. Those include the British, Chinese, American,\r\nNigerian and Guinean Governments and the European\r\nUnion.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly,\r\nI wish to thank the Vice-President of the Republic of\r\nSierra Leone for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Solomon Ekuma Dominic Berewa, Vice-\r\nPresident of the Republic of Sierra Leone, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Lassana Traoré, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs and International Cooperation of Mali.\r\nMr. Traoré (Mali) (spoke in French): First, Sir,\r\nplease accept my warm congratulations and my fervent\r\nhopes for your successful achievement of the mission\r\nentrusted to you. Your election to the presidency of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly is a fitting\r\ntribute by the international community to the people of\r\nSaint Lucia. I am convinced that with your experience\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nand your distinguished intellectual and ethical\r\nqualities, you will successfully lead our work to be\r\ncarried out in the best spirit.\r\nSir, I wish to convey to your predecessor, Mr. Jan\r\nKavan, the congratulations of the delegation of Mali\r\nfor the skill, dedication and spirit of initiative and the\r\nauthority with which he directed the work of the fifty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly. I also take\r\nthis solemn occasion to pay well-deserved tribute to\r\nSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan for his dedication to\r\nthe ideals of the United Nations.\r\nThe present session is opening in a context where\r\nthe United Nations is still confronting challenges to its\r\nvery existence; those challenges moved humanity 58\r\nyears ago to equip itself with an instrument of hope\r\ncapable of meeting them. Let us recall that the United\r\nNations were conceived to save ourselves from the\r\ndemons of war and insecurity. The idea was to secure a\r\nstate of grace  one of man reconciled with himself \r\nand to create the conditions for reducing material want,\r\nuncertainty and poverty.\r\nFlashpoints of tension  fire and smoke  exist\r\nand are developing in many places. Poverty and\r\ndistress are the daily lot of many inhabitants of our\r\nplanet, particularly in Africa.\r\nThe arrival of the new millennium brought\r\nenormous hopes. We have barely turned to the third\r\npage of this millennium and new challenges are\r\nassailing humankind. Upon us are other questions for\r\nwhich we must uncover the appropriate solutions so\r\nthat our Organization will remain true to itself and\r\npursue its goals without succumbing to a hijacking of\r\nits mandate.\r\nThe Government of Mali believes that the United\r\nNations remains an instrument of great value. Defining\r\nthe rules of the game is one thing; applying them under\r\nthe watchful eye of an impartial arbiter who has the\r\nnecessary authority and the corresponding means to act\r\nis another. We need to work to make the United\r\nNations that authority and arbiter.\r\nFor its part, under the distinguished leadership of\r\nMr. Amadou Toumani Touré, President of the Republic\r\nof Mali, our country is steadfastly committed to\r\nsupporting the United Nations in attaining its objective:\r\nthe full development of humankind.\r\nAt the national level, our President is firmly\r\ncommitted to strengthening the institutions of the\r\nRepublic and of communities, to promote democracy\r\nand human rights and to give a boost to good governance,\r\neconomic growth and sustainable development.\r\nPeace and security are among the principal values\r\nheld and venerated by the peoples of the entire world\r\nas they are essential for their social and economic\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMali has been fully committed to the twin\r\nchallenges of conflict prevention and conflict\r\nmanagement. At the subregional level, Mali has sent\r\ntroops to Liberia, and our President has been\r\npersonally committed to solidarity with the\r\nGovernment and people of Côte dIvoire in their search\r\nfor coordinated political solutions to the crisis faced by\r\nthat brotherly country. That testifies to the importance\r\nwe attach to peace and stability.\r\nAt the continental level, our country will\r\nunstintingly continue its tireless efforts within the\r\nAfrican Union, which have deployed continuously\r\nsince the establishment of the African Union to achieve\r\nstability, the guarantor for all economic social and\r\ncultural development. Therefore, Mali calls on all\r\nStates to adopt a multilateral approach, subregional and\r\nregional cooperation and international solidarity, with\r\nrigorous respect for the sovereignty of States.\r\nThe overall situation prevailing in the Middle\r\nEast, in particular the conflict in Iraq, remains a\r\nburning issue of the day and a major concern for the\r\ninternational community. We should point out to the\r\nprotagonists of these conflicts that war is never\r\nanything other than a political failure and that the\r\nvictories of peace are no less renowned than those of\r\nwar. Peace between Palestinians and Israelis will\r\ngarner more fame than all wars combined. The parties\r\nto the conflict should be mindful of that.\r\nIn addition, we invite the international\r\ncommunity to provide aid and assistance to the\r\nPalestinian people and the Palestinian Authority\r\nbecause the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure\r\nand the restrictions imposed as a result of occupation\r\nhave caused a clear deterioration of the socio-economic\r\nfabric of Palestinian society. It is therefore to be feared\r\nthat the strategy of destruction will henceforth become\r\na constant in how conflicts unfold in general.\r\nTerrorism is one of the gravest threats to human\r\nsecurity. Combating that scourge requires strengthening\r\nnational and regional capacities. It should be recalled\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nthat Mali has ratified all international legal instruments\r\nconcerning terrorism and transnational organized\r\ncrime, as well as the additional protocol.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that the international\r\ncommunity, in particular the United Nations, has made\r\nthe campaign against the proliferation of small arms\r\nand light weapons a major focus of concern. That is\r\nparticularly reassuring because, for the last ten years,\r\nsmall arms and light weapons have weighed on the\r\nfuture and destiny of the peoples of Africa. Their\r\nadverse affects have been a great blow to human\r\ndignity, freedom and security.\r\nMali, which since 10 May 2003 has held the\r\npresidency of the Human Security Network, calls on all\r\nStates to unite for the success of the initiative of the\r\nframework convention on international transfers of\r\narms, currently being drafted, which is expected to be\r\nlaunched in Bamako next October; it will be an\r\nimportant step towards the establishment of the\r\nmandate of the heads of State and Government of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States to\r\ntransform the moratorium on small arms and light\r\nweapons into an international convention.\r\nIn addition, Mali continues to be deeply\r\nconcerned by the phenomenon of child soldiers and\r\ncalls for vigorous action to put an end to that practice,\r\nif we wish to save future generations from the scourge\r\nof war.\r\nFor many reasons, the level of security for the\r\nworlds population has considerably deteriorated in\r\nrecent years. Even today, in many African countries,\r\npeople are often caught in the grip of conflicts\r\ninvolving guerrillas, rebel groups, civil war, ethnic war,\r\nclan war and clashes between militias, warlords and\r\nregular army forces. Designing a political strategy\r\nbased on the idea of human security has now become a\r\nvery urgent priority.\r\nFor its mandate at the head of the Human\r\nSecurity Network, Mali has made its priority the issues\r\nof education in human rights, children in armed\r\nconflict, the campaign against the proliferation of small\r\narms and light weapons, gender in peacekeeping\r\noperations and food security.\r\nIn the field of economics, the Government of\r\nMali is adopting stimulative fiscal measures in order to\r\nattract national and international investment, in\r\nparticular in the productive areas of cotton, mines and\r\nraising livestock. But those efforts are being hampered\r\nby the effects of globalization. In fact, in agriculture in\r\nparticular, it is not so much poverty that offends as the\r\nconditions that engender that poverty.\r\nTo give but one example, Mali  like other\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries  is\r\nsuffering from the cotton competition with developed\r\ncountries, which each year provide five times more\r\nfunds in subsidies to their farmers than they do to\r\ndevelopment assistance. Those subsidies have a direct\r\nimpact on world cotton prices, which are lower than\r\nthey have been for 25 years. That policy of cotton\r\nproduction and export subsidies by certain developed\r\ncountries must be abandoned, because they are contrary\r\nto the rules and principles of the multilateral trade\r\nsystem. They are ruining African economies, depriving\r\nour farmers of their share of the world market, and\r\nexacerbating the poverty that we undertook to\r\neliminate at the Millennium Summit.\r\nOn another topic, Mali welcomes the adoption of\r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action, whose aim is forge\r\npartnerships that will better meet the special needs of\r\nthe landlocked developing countries. We believe that\r\nthat Programme makes it incumbent on the\r\ninternational community to devise a new framework of\r\ncooperation with respect to transportation and transit\r\n a policy that will help developing landlocked\r\ncountries to integrate into the world economy and to\r\nspeed up their socio-economic development. To do so,\r\nit is essential that this Programme of Action be\r\nimplemented with diligence at all levels, with the\r\nactive assistance of the technical and financial partners\r\nof the landlocked developing countries.\r\nGiven the major changes that the world is going\r\nthrough today and the many challenges that it faces,\r\nAfrica decided to crystallize its willingness to act\r\nthrough two initiatives: the creation of the African\r\nUnion and the launching of the New Partnership for\r\nAfricas Development. These two initiatives represent a\r\nclear and courageous vision of the way Africa intends\r\nto shoulder its responsibilities with respect to its own\r\ndevelopment and its full integration into the world\r\neconomy.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the commitment made by\r\nthe international community here at United Nations\r\nHeadquarters to support the tremendous task of\r\ndevelopment in Africa, and we welcome the actions of\r\nthe Group of Eight aimed at establishing programmes\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nthat will help translate into reality the commitments\r\nmade in the African action plan. We hope that this\r\nexample will be followed by the international\r\ncommunity, because the implementation of NEPAD\r\nwill require substantial and effective support.\r\nWith respect to information and communication\r\ntechnologies, my delegation welcomes the upcoming\r\nholding, in December 2003 in Geneva, of the first\r\nphase of the World Summit on the Information Society,\r\nwhich will offer the international community, and\r\nAfrican States in particular, the opportunity to discuss\r\nthe role of those technologies and their impact on\r\nsocio-economic development. The second phase will be\r\nheld in Tunis, Africa, and we hope that the Summit will\r\nadopt specific measures to promote the development of\r\nthe least advanced people in these areas.\r\nThe world is in crisis, and the worldwide crisis at\r\npresent is largely due to humankinds inability to\r\ncomprehend and to take on the responsibilities required\r\nby the new role that is required in the world. In the\r\ncontext of this crisis, realities have changed also for the\r\nUnited Nations. Today we have to deal with those who\r\nhad previously been overlooked.\r\nFor Mali, the United Nations remains the living\r\nincarnation of this hope for peace and security. It is an\r\nunequalled instrument. But, like any other instrument,\r\nit can worn out if it is overused, and from time to time\r\nit needs to be reinvigorated in order to be more\r\neffective, efficient and modern and to perform better.\r\nOur Organization is at a crossroads. To quote a\r\ncontemporary author,\r\nIf we keep looking towards the past to prolong\r\nit, we are doomed. If we look towards a new\r\nhorizon, then our strength, our creativity and the\r\npower of our intellect will do the rest.\r\nThe past of our Organization has shown its limits.\r\nWe must now implement reforms that will allow us to\r\nrealize our hopes for the future. Global governance\r\nrequires the democratization of the decision-making\r\nstructures that will implement it. The current\r\nmembership of the Security Council, for example, no\r\nlonger meets the needs of our planet. Its composition\r\nmust reflect its universal nature. Therefore, we are in\r\nfavour of opening it up and expanding it to include\r\nother Member States in order better to meet the\r\ncomplex challenges of the day.\r\nMali has taken note of the commitments made\r\nalong these lines by the Secretary-General in his most\r\nrecent report and reaffirms the central role of the\r\nUnited Nations in the implementation of international\r\ncommitments and the fact that this can be done only if\r\nthere is a dynamic and innovative partnership between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nThe creation of the International Criminal Court,\r\nwhose elected judges and Prosecutor were sworn in this\r\nyear, is certainly a success for the international\r\ncommunity, which has fought against impunity and\r\nmade it a subject of international concern. In fact, for\r\ntwo decades, the fight against impunity and respect for\r\nhuman dignity has mobilized all people of goodwill.\r\nAlthough recent developments seem to indicate\r\nthat prospects for the advent of an independent\r\ninternational judicial forum do not appear promising, I\r\nwould recall that the path to follow involves not only\r\nresolving conflicts and establishing peace, but also\r\nrequires our determination to work together. We are\r\nconvinced of this, and therefore Mali would plead for a\r\nstrong ICC  a universal ICC, acting as an instrument\r\nwhich cannot be deterred and which will help\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall that democracy,\r\njustice, freedom, peace, security, development and\r\nrespect for commitments are common values that are\r\nour foundation for, and give us a sense of, our\r\nhumanity.\r\nAll people must be given their freedom and their\r\ndignity. We therefore call on all States to look to the\r\nfuture to imagine and to promote the lifestyle that\r\ncorresponds to the aspirations of our people. To do so,\r\nwe are determined to reject any sense of fatalism of\r\nwhatever kind  political, economic, social or cultural.\r\nIndeed, today there are men and women who are\r\ncapable, through their work and through their will, of\r\nrealizing the aspirations of our peoples for well-being,\r\npeace, security, prosperity and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Now we can hope to build a new world\r\n a world that is rich in its diversity  within the\r\nframework of the United Nations and on new bases, a\r\nglorious world in which we can work together in a\r\nspirit of solidarity.\r\nSome of those men and women, on behalf of the\r\npeoples of the world, paid with their lives for their\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\ndedication to the lofty ideals of the United Nations. Let\r\nthem always be in our thoughts and prayers.\r\nLet us all work together. Let us all continue to\r\nbelieve in the intrinsic nature of human beings  in\r\ntheir basic dignity and kind-heartedness.\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Kassymzhomart Tokaev, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Tokaev (Kazakhstan): Allow me, Sir, to\r\nexpress my confidence that, under your able leadership,\r\nthe general debate of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\neighth session will be successful and fruitful.\r\nAt the turn of the millennium, the international\r\ncommunity is living through changes of epic\r\nproportions. The process of transition to a new world\r\norder is facing unprecedented global threats: inter-\r\nethnic and inter-confessional conflicts; international\r\nterrorism and organized crime; natural, man-made and\r\nhumanitarian disasters; diseases and epidemics; and\r\nenergy and environmental problems.\r\nThese threats are in addition to globalization\r\nprocesses. All States now share in not only economic,\r\ntechnological, information and management issues, but\r\nalso must face the numerous problems looming over\r\nhumankind like a dark cloud.\r\nWe in Kazakhstan believe that the time has come\r\nfor the entire international community to join together\r\nto ensure broad and effective cooperation to address\r\nglobal threats. Today, it is becoming increasingly evident\r\nthat States involvement in globalization processes is an\r\nimportant factor in their economic prosperity.\r\nIt is our conviction that there is no alternative to\r\nKazakhstans political and economic openness. In the\r\npast four years, our country has had one of the fastest\r\neconomic growth rates in the world. Kazakhstan is\r\nleading the Commonwealth of Independent States\r\n(CIS) in main economic indicators. As a country with a\r\nmarket economy, Kazakhstan is an integral part of the\r\nglobal economy and an active participant in the\r\nglobalization process. Its early admission to the World\r\nTrade Organization (WTO) is a top priority for\r\nKazakhstan.\r\nOur countrys efforts to create a comprehensive\r\nsecurity system in Asia are well known. The process of\r\nthe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building\r\nMeasures in Asia, initiated by President Nursultan\r\nNazarbaev, serves this purpose and also provides for\r\nactive cooperation between regional States in such an\r\nimportant area as the combating of international\r\nterrorism. Further support for this process by the\r\nUnited Nations and all of our partners will undoubtedly\r\ngo a long way towards creating a climate of trust and\r\ngood-neighbourly relations on the Asian continent.\r\nWe are firmly committed to strengthening\r\nregional integration. Kazakhstan is actively involved in\r\nwork within the Eurasian Economic Community. We\r\nhave great expectations regarding the creation of a\r\nsingle economic space in the territories of four CIS\r\ncountries. A significant contribution to counter-\r\nterrorism efforts and trade and economic cooperation in\r\nthe Eurasian region could be made by the Shanghai\r\nCooperation Organization. We are taking steps to\r\ndevelop cooperation with the Central Asian States. We\r\nintend to further promote the activities of the Economic\r\nCooperation Organization.\r\nKazakhstan backs United Nations action to\r\nstrengthen the efforts of the international community in\r\nsupport of the dialogue between civilizations and\r\nreligions. Kazakhstan, a unique State in terms of\r\nreligious tolerance and inter-ethnic harmony, convened\r\na congress of representatives of world religions and\r\nconfessions, which, in the unanimous opinion of its\r\nparticipants, revealed a considerable peacemaking\r\ncapacity of our country.\r\nAn unprecedented attack against the United\r\nNations office in Baghdad in August was the cruellest\r\nand largest-scale terrorist act in the entire history of\r\nour Organization. Together with the rest of the\r\ninternational community, Kazakhstan pays a special\r\ntribute to the late Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United\r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and\r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nIraq, and his colleagues.\r\nIn our view, it is imperative to ensure that efforts\r\nto restore peace and stability in Iraq are carried out\r\nwithin the legal framework of the United Nations. The\r\npost-war reconstruction of the country and assistance\r\nto the Iraqi population should be provided only under\r\nthe umbrella of the United Nations. Kazakhstan has\r\nalready made a practical contribution to this process by\r\ndeploying in Iraq a group of its military officers.\r\nThe Iraqi crisis has become a serious test for the\r\nUnited Nations and has highlighted the urgent need to\r\ncarry out the institutional reform of the Organization.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nKazakhstan reaffirms its commitment to the\r\nconcept of a multipolar world as a political philosophy\r\nof modern international relations. At the same time, we\r\ndo not reject unipolarity if its means joining together\r\nthe efforts of all States in the world in a bid to avert\r\nglobal threats.\r\nGiven its authority, universal character and\r\nunique experience, the United Nations continues to\r\nplay an indispensable coordinating role in all global\r\naffairs. Its effectiveness, however, is dependent on our\r\nwill, and we should, through joint efforts, reform the\r\nOrganization with a view to democratizing international\r\nrelations. In this context, it is essential to strengthen the\r\nrole of the Security Council in the settlement of crisis\r\nsituations and to provide it with appropriate mandates\r\nand means for conflict-prevention. We call for making\r\nit a more representative body by co-opting five new\r\nmembers, including Germany and Japan, as well as, on\r\nthe basis of rotation, African, Asian and Latin American\r\nStates. In order to facilitate consensus, which is greatly\r\nneeded, new Security Council members might exercise\r\nthe veto power, with certain exceptions, subject to\r\nfurther discussion in the high-level panel which the\r\nSecretary-General intends to establish. We believe that\r\nit will also be necessary to increase the number of non-\r\npermanent members, with due account being taken of\r\nthe interests of the Asian region.\r\nIn our view, coordination between the United\r\nNations and regional organizations should be\r\nreinvigorated. In this context, Kazakhstan proposes to\r\nestablish a permanent council of regional organizations\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nIt is time to combine, in practical terms, the\r\nefforts of the United Nations, the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, the WTO and other leading economic and\r\nfinancial organizations to address poverty and social\r\ndevelopment. Kazakhstan believes that close attention\r\nshould be paid to the proposal to establish an economic\r\nand social security council.\r\nKazakhstan supports the Secretary-Generals\r\nproposal  to which I referred earlier  to establish a\r\nhigh-level panel to examine current challenges to peace\r\nand security and to strengthen the United Nations system.\r\nWe believe that issues of environmental\r\nprotection in the framework of sustainable\r\ndevelopment should be considered as a key item on the\r\nUnited Nations agenda. In this context, President\r\nNazarbaevs proposal, made last year in Johannesburg,\r\nto create a United Nations register of global\r\nenvironmental problems is especially relevant. Such a\r\nregister would provide an opportunity to ensure a\r\ncontinuous exchange of information among United\r\nNations Member States about trends in the global\r\nenvironmental situation, which is extremely important\r\nfor the prevention of natural disasters. With regard to\r\nenvironmental issues, I would like, from this rostrum,\r\nonce again to urge the international community to pay\r\ndue attention to the search for practical solutions to the\r\nproblems of the Aral Sea and the Semipalatinsk region.\r\nThe current surge of terrorist acts throughout the\r\nworld has made clear the transnational nature of\r\nterrorism. We must recognize that terrorism is well\r\norganized, financially self-sufficient and bolstered by\r\npowerful ideological dictums that are poisoning the\r\nconsciousness of an ever-greater number of people.\r\nAgainst that background, the strengthening of the\r\ninternational legal framework of counter-terrorist\r\ncooperation is especially relevant. Kazakhstan supports\r\nthe adoption, without further delay, of a comprehensive\r\nconvention against international terrorism.\r\nKazakhstan, which has drug routes running\r\nthrough its territory, calls for joint efforts by States to\r\neliminate the evil of drug trafficking, which seriously\r\nerodes international security. Increasing drug production\r\nin Afghanistan demands special attention. In order to\r\neffectively counter the existing drug threat, it is\r\nnecessary to apply an integrated approach on the basis\r\nof an agreed international strategy with the United\r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime playing a\r\ncoordinating role.\r\nKazakhstan has put forward an initiative\r\nregarding the establishment in Almaty of a Central\r\nAsian preventive diplomacy and conflict management\r\ncentre and calls for its support. Such an institution\r\nwould strengthen the United Nations activities in the\r\nregion, which should be in the interests of all countries\r\nconcerned.\r\nAs a State that has voluntarily renounced its\r\nnuclear heritage, Kazakhstan is concerned about the\r\ncontinued proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe desire of a number of countries and some extremist\r\norganizations to possess nuclear weapons and other\r\ntypes of weapons of mass destruction poses a serious\r\nthreat to global security. The well-known British writer\r\nAldous Huxley was prophetic when he said:\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nTechnological progress has merely provided us\r\nwith more efficient means of going backwards.\r\nLet us face the facts: today, the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty do not work in practice. The main\r\nreason for this state of affairs is weakened international\r\ncontrol.\r\nThere are already 39 States in the world capable\r\nof producing a nuclear bomb or a nuclear device and at\r\nleast 8 countries with significant nuclear capacity. In\r\naddition, there are at least another 4 countries whose\r\nnon-nuclear status is highly questionable.\r\nThe United Nations and its institutions should\r\nhave the last word in solving the problem of nuclear\r\nnon-proliferation. There is actually one way out:\r\ntighten control and improve transparency with regard\r\nto weapons development and testing.\r\nExisting international agreements in this area\r\nshould be adapted to new realities. We can no longer\r\naccept the fact that the international community lacks\r\neffective means to discipline States violating non-\r\nproliferation regimes. Here we witness the absence of a\r\nsingle standard: some countries are punished by\r\nmilitary force, while others are simply urged to give up\r\ntheir nuclear programmes.\r\nKazakhstan has welcomed the initiative of the\r\nGroup of Eight regarding a global partnership against\r\nthe proliferation of nuclear materials and weapons of\r\nmass destruction, and it hopes for fruitful cooperation\r\non the issue with that group of States.\r\nOur country considers it important to implement\r\nthe Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and\r\nEradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects.\r\nThe International Ministerial Conference on\r\nTransit Transport Cooperation, held in August in\r\nAlmaty, has become a turning point in the efforts to\r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\nAlmaty Declaration and the Programme of Action\r\nadopted as an outcome of the Conference have laid a\r\nsolid foundation for global partnership designed to put\r\nin place effective transit transport systems. Occupying\r\na vast stretch of land in Eurasia, Kazakhstan is keenly\r\ninterested in the practical implementation of the goals\r\nin these documents so that it can better tap its own\r\ntransport potential.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate\r\nKazakhstans commitment to the United Nations\r\nreform process in order to ensure a safer and more just\r\nworld order. I fully share the Secretary-Generals sense\r\nof urgency when it comes to structural changes within\r\nthe United Nations. Indeed, history would be\r\nunforgiving to us if we were to squander an\r\nopportunity to reform our Organization.\r\nThe President: I now call on Mr. Kamal\r\nKharrazi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran.\r\nMr. Kharrazi (Islamic Republic of Iran) (spoke\r\nin Farsi; English text provided by the delegation): I\r\nwould like to express my cordial congratulations to the\r\nPresident for presiding over this important session of\r\nthe General Assembly. I wish also to express my\r\ncongratulations to other members of the Bureau on\r\ntheir election.\r\nLess than 60 years ago, our founding fathers\r\nestablished the United Nations, with the aspiration to\r\npromote peace and security through cooperation and to\r\nmake our world a better place. The creation of this\r\nOrganization was in fact the manifestation of the\r\ninternational communitys determination to prevent the\r\nscourge of war, which had inflicted tremendous loss\r\nand damage upon humankind. The United Nations was\r\nalso designed to promote economic, social and human\r\ndevelopment and assist Member States to eradicate\r\ninjustice and poverty.\r\nThese objectives and concerns remain as valid as\r\never and perhaps are even more relevant today. We\r\nbelieve it is time to take stock of recent developments\r\nand the utility and record of the United Nations, with a\r\nview to promoting the authority, efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations, and recognizing its\r\ncentral role in addressing the challenges of our time.\r\nThe United States waged an unsanctioned war\r\nagainst Iraq with three expressed objectives: to find\r\nweapons of mass destruction, to fight international\r\nterrorism and to bring democracy to the Iraqi people.\r\nThe first is yet to be realized. The second has\r\nbackfired. And, as far as the third is concerned, the\r\ncollapse of a dictatorship is a highly welcome\r\ndevelopment in the region, but, as history has shown,\r\nsocial change, including the democratization of a\r\nsociety, can only be brought about from within, and\r\ncannot be imported in tandem with tank columns. In\r\nour view, callous indifference to the negative\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nconsequences of the invasion of Iraq to the conduct of\r\ninternational relations and a lack of full understanding\r\nof the post-war situation in Iraq, particularly the social\r\nand the cultural complexities of Iraqi society, have\r\ncreated both an international predicament and a source\r\nof instability at our borders.\r\nAs a neighbouring State, Iran adopted a policy of\r\nself-restraint during the war in Iraq and has continued\r\nto adopt a constructive approach to the current situation\r\nin that country by calling on the occupying Powers to\r\nallow the immediate transfer of Iraqi sovereignty to the\r\nIraqi people and to withdraw their troops. We welcome\r\nand support the establishment of the Iraqi Governing\r\nCouncil and the Council of Ministers and call for\r\ngranting a central and clear-cut role to the United\r\nNations in the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and the\r\nconstitutional process. We wish to promote unity and\r\ngreater respect for stability and security among various\r\nethnic and religious groups in Iraq, and encourage and\r\nsupport the swift setting in motion of a constitutional\r\nand institutional process, with a view to establishing a\r\ndemocratic and fully representative Government by and\r\nfor the people of Iraq. We urge respect for the national\r\nunity, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq and\r\nthe provision of relief emergency assistance to the\r\npeople of Iraq.\r\nPending the restoration of sovereignty and\r\nauthority to the people of Iraq, the occupying Powers\r\nhave the legal responsibility under applicable\r\ninternational law to provide for the welfare of the\r\npeople under occupation, particularly their security. In\r\nthis context, the United Nations should be allowed to\r\nplay a central role in laying the ground work, on an\r\nurgent basis, in assisting the Iraqi people to establish a\r\ndemocratic and representative Government and in\r\nsupervising the transfer of authority to them. The\r\ninternational community, in general, and Iraqs\r\nneighbours, in particular, will undoubtedly lend their\r\nfull support to the United Nations in this endeavour.\r\nI would like to express once again my\r\ncondolences to the Secretary-General and the United\r\nNations community as a whole for the loss of a brave\r\nservant of the nations, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, and\r\nother United Nations personnel in the terrorist bombing\r\nof the United Nations headquarters in Iraq. The people\r\nand Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran also\r\nsympathize with the people of Iraq over the loss of\r\nanother man of peace, Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-\r\nHakim, in a separate terrorist bombing in Iraq.\r\nThe violence against and the killing of innocent\r\nPalestinian people by the Israeli Army have become a\r\ndaily occurrence, and prospects for a viable peace are\r\nsteadily diminishing. The Palestinian people live under\r\nbrutal occupation and oppression with no hope for\r\nrelief, let alone peace and prosperity. The policy of the\r\nSharon Government of reoccupying Palestinian cities\r\nand using military force to further terrorize the\r\nPalestinian people has exacerbated the situation and\r\nadded to the despair and frustration of ordinary people.\r\nThe international community has a major responsibility\r\nto take effective measures in alleviating the suffering\r\nof the Palestinian people.\r\nThe recent decision of the Israeli regime to expel\r\nPresident Arafat from his homeland has outraged the\r\ninternational community, in general, and the Muslim\r\nworld, in particular. I am confident that the free and\r\ncivilized world will continue to reject and condemn\r\nsuch a move by Israel. It is regrettable that the United\r\nStates, last week, once again and for the thirty-sixth\r\ntime, resorted to the veto to block the adoption of a\r\ndraft resolution.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, I wish to take this\r\nopportunity to express our satisfaction over the steady\r\nimprovement of the situation in Afghanistan under the\r\nleadership of President Karzai and his Government. At\r\nthe same time, we are concerned about problems such\r\nas the regrouping of remnants of the Taliban and Al\r\nQaeda, the paucity of international assistance and the\r\nincrease in opium poppy cultivation. Unless the\r\ninternational community is more forthcoming in\r\nassisting the Afghan people and Government, recent\r\nachievements in Afghanistan may be jeopardized.\r\nWe have a great stake in the return of full\r\nnormality and stability to Afghanistan. In this area, we\r\nhave strongly supported the central role of the United\r\nNations in helping the Afghans to rebuild their own\r\ncountry, and we believe that the United Nations should\r\ncontinue to play this role for the foreseeable future.\r\nTerrorism is a global phenomenon that requires a\r\nglobal response. Fighting terrorism requires a\r\nmultifaceted approach that goes well beyond a simple\r\nfocus on law and order and also addresses its\r\nunderlying causes. A unilateral and one-dimensional\r\napproach, based merely on the use of force, may\r\nneutralize some threats and bring some psychological\r\ncomfort to those who seek revenge in response to\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nterrorist acts, but few would regard that as a serious\r\nmethods of uprooting international terrorism.\r\nAny attempt to link terrorism to a specific\r\nreligion or culture is prejudicial, politically motivated\r\nand thus unacceptable. No religion authorizes its\r\nadherents to kill innocent people, whatever the\r\nobjective of such acts might be.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran condemns terrorism\r\nin all its forms and manifestations. Iran has done more\r\nthan its fair share to effectively combat terrorism. In\r\nthe heat of the military intervention in Afghanistan and\r\nin the wake of the Taliban collapse, thousands of\r\nindividuals were denied entry into Iran; more than\r\n2,300 individuals with false or no travel documents\r\nwere deported and hundreds of suspects were arrested,\r\ninterrogated and handed over to their countries of\r\nnationality or residence; and lists of such persons were\r\nbrought to the attention of the relevant United Nations\r\nofficials and bodies. Iran continues to cooperate in\r\nserious and long-term efforts to combat terrorism in a\r\ncomprehensive, non-discriminatory and non-selective\r\nmanner  efforts that do not pick and choose between\r\ngood and bad, or useful, terrorists.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction are among the most\r\npotent threats to peace and security at the regional and\r\nglobal levels. The Chemical Weapons Convention,\r\nBiological Weapons Convention and the Treaty on the\r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are the\r\nresults of our collective wisdom in our efforts to\r\neliminate the threat of chemical and biological\r\nweapons and the spread of nuclear weapons. We\r\nbelieve that more needs to be done. We should do more\r\nto make these basic international instruments universal.\r\nWe should also do more to strengthen verification of\r\ntheir implementation. Finally, we should all work\r\ncollectively, as mandated by the International Court of\r\nJustice, to move towards the total elimination of\r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nBy adhering to all of these three instruments as an\r\noriginal party, my country has shown its determination\r\nto work towards the complete eradication of weapons\r\nof mass destruction from the Earth. Our commitment to\r\ninternational regimes on weapons of mass destruction\r\nlies not merely in our contractual obligations but, more\r\nimportantly, in our religious convictions and historical\r\nexperience. No country has suffered as acutely as mine\r\nfrom the tragic scars left from being victims of such\r\nweapons, particularly against the backdrop of a\r\ncomplacent international environment. We are\r\nconvinced that the pursuit of nuclear weapons and\r\nother weapons of mass destruction will not only fail to\r\nprovide deterrence or enhance security and influence,\r\nbut will only increase vulnerability. Thus, I can state\r\ncategorically that for all these reasons, weapons of\r\nmass destruction have no place in the defensive\r\nstrategy of my country. We believe the only option is to\r\nwork actively towards a global and regional ban on\r\nthese weapons, and we have thus spared no effort in\r\nthis regard.\r\nHowever, the efforts to ban, or strengthen the\r\nban, on weapons of mass destruction should not\r\nprovide any excuse for denying States the right to\r\ndevelop technology for peaceful purposes.\r\nUnfortunately, the political pressure against the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran to relinquish its inalienable right to\r\ndevelop peaceful nuclear technology is mounting,\r\nwhile some nuclear weapon States continue to test and\r\ndevelop advanced tactical nuclear weapons\r\nprogrammes. Furthermore, in defiance of international\r\ncalls to adhere to the NPT, Israel is continuing, with\r\nimpunity, its clandestine development of sophisticated\r\nnuclear weapons and their delivery systems. All NPT\r\nReview and Extension conferences have called for the\r\nsuspension and freezing of Israels tactical weapons\r\nand nuclear programmes, which are the real threats to\r\ninternational peace and security. They are both\r\nconsidered to be in contravention with the letter and\r\nspirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nIrans nuclear programme is solely for peaceful\r\npurposes, specifically for the planned production of\r\n7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 for Irans\r\neconomic development. Iran will vigorously pursue its\r\npeaceful nuclear programme and will not give in to\r\nunreasonable, discriminatory and selective demands\r\nthat go beyond the requirements of non-proliferation\r\nunder existing International Atomic Energy Agency\r\ninstruments. At the same time, Iran does not have a\r\nnuclear weapons programme, nor does it intend to\r\nembark on one. Thus, we have nothing to hide, and in\r\nprinciple have no problem with the Additional Protocol.\r\nWe are eager to ensure that this step will be utilized\r\nsolely to enhance confidence and remove all doubts\r\nabout the peaceful nature of our nuclear programme.\r\nMr. Micha Ondo Bile (Equatorial Guinea), Vice-\r\nPresident took the Chair.\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nIn facing global challenges, no possibility other\r\nthan mutual cooperation through the United Nations\r\nwill be conducive to lasting and effective solutions.\r\nThe democratic process advocated at all levels within\r\nthe international community needs also to be reflected\r\nwithin the United Nations system. The General\r\nAssembly should play a more active role in global\r\naffairs. A more representative and democratic Security\r\nCouncil would mean a more efficient United Nations\r\n the kind of organization we should all want and\r\nwork for.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The\r\nnext speaker is His Excellency Mr. Vartan Oskanian,\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia.\r\nMr. Oskanian (Armenia): We thank Jan Kavan\r\nfor his work, and we welcome Mr. Julian Hunte in the\r\ndifficult year that awaits him.\r\nAt the beginning of this millennium, a summit of\r\nthe worlds leaders produced a set of development\r\ngoals aimed at protecting life and promoting dignity for\r\nall peoples. This seemed an appropriate way to begin\r\nthe third millennium of our modern era.\r\nEach year since then, however, we have been\r\nreminded that this millennium started very differently\r\nand has forced us to address profound challenges to our\r\nassumptions, our relationships and our way of life.\r\nBeginning with 11 September and continuing with the\r\nviolence and political crises around the world, each of\r\nour societies, nations and regions has been transformed\r\nby the intensity of these threats to our way of life and\r\nto our security.\r\nThese crises are forcing a transformation of this\r\nOrganization as well. Today, reform has become\r\nessential not just in the way we decide, act and operate,\r\nbut in the way we think. Reforms cannot be delayed if\r\nthis General Assembly and this Organization are to be\r\ntruly relevant as facilitators of world peace. If the\r\nUnited Nations is for the peaceful, prosperous and\r\ndemocratic development of todays world, then it must\r\nundergo its own democratization, so that it will have\r\nthe increased moral authority to direct others through\r\nreform and democratic transition.\r\nAn organization that espouses dialogue and\r\nnegotiation as alternatives to violence and conflict\r\nought to find ways through dialogue and negotiation to\r\narrive at a consensus on how to resolve the critical,\r\nuniversal issues facing us today.\r\nThis General Assembly has the chance to go\r\ndown in history, not as an undermined, inadequate but\r\nwell-meaning giant, but as a viable instrument of world\r\npeace. The Secretary-Generals goals, from United\r\nNations budget and financing reform to reconstituting\r\nand enlarging the Security Council, are the building\r\nblocks of the relevant, responsive, comprehending,\r\nworld forum for international cooperation that the\r\nUnited Nations can be. We applaud his decision to\r\nempower a commission to give concrete form to the\r\nwishes of many.\r\nEach year we speak of the need for a\r\ncomprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East,\r\nnever believing that next year, the region can become\r\neven more volatile and explosive. We believe the\r\nUnited Nations and all Member States must continue to\r\nsupport the renewal of the full-scale peace process. In\r\nIsrael and Palestine, Armenia hails the Quartets\r\nefforts, recognizing that the endangered road map\r\nremains the only viable option for peace in a long-\r\nsuffering region.\r\nThe situation in Iraq makes the debate about the\r\nhows and whys of this conflict irrelevant. The worlds\r\nsmall countries are accustomed to making political\r\ncompromises to join the international flow. In Iraq, the\r\nprincipal Powers, too, must compromise so that a more\r\nengaged and empowered United Nations can rally a\r\nbroad range of countries from the immediate region, as\r\nwell as the rest of the world, to take on responsibility\r\nin bringing democracy and stability to a critical part of\r\nthe Middle East.\r\nIt is ironic and in many ways lamentable that the\r\nevil of terrorism is what has caused us to rally together.\r\nWe are fully aware that no single Government can\r\neffectively fight this danger alone. Unfortunately, the\r\nnecessity for coherent measures and cooperation at\r\nnational, regional and international levels is often\r\nstalled, as for example in our region, where a common\r\nthreat that knows no borders is not only being\r\naddressed individually and in isolation, but also\r\nexploited for political reasons.\r\nIn our region, there is much political exploitation.\r\nThe new Prime Minister of Azerbaijan made plain from\r\nthis podium yesterday that in his Governments\r\nelection year, they are willing, at their peril, to ignore\r\nthe realities which are self-evident. Nearly a decade of\r\nnegotiations brought us, two years ago, to Key West,\r\nFlorida, where, hosted by the United States\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nGovernment and under the watchful eyes of the Minsk\r\nGroup Co-Chairmen, the President of Armenia and \r\nwhether the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan likes it or not\r\n the President of Azerbaijan did in fact reach an\r\nunderstanding which reflected those realities.\r\nThere are two myths in Azerbaijan today  both\r\nof them faulty, miscalculated and risky. Since 1992,\r\nAzerbaijan has convinced itself that if they just hold\r\nout long enough, Armenias economy will capitulate,\r\nand leave Nagorny Karabakh unprotected and\r\ndefenceless. Their calculations that a blockade of\r\nArmenia would mean that our economic and social\r\nconditions will plummet while their oil-based economy\r\ngrows have proven misguided and misinformed. Not\r\nonly has Armenias economy not succumbed to\r\npolitical pressures, but our rate of growth is greater\r\nthan Azerbaijans  and not only Azerbaijans.\r\nNevertheless, they continue to cling to a second\r\nand related myth. Dreaming of future oil sales whose\r\nrevenues will be used to buy armaments, Azerbaijan is\r\nanticipating the day when it will again have the\r\nresources to pursue a military solution. This is self-\r\ndeception, as well. Azerbaijan has forgotten that\r\nsimilar fantasies led them to respond militarily to the\r\npeaceful demands of Nagorny Karabakhs population\r\nfor self-determination in 1992. The military balance\r\nwas hugely in their favour then, in proportions far\r\ngreater than what they might hope for in the future.\r\nStill, the moral, historical, legal and psychological\r\nbalance favoured the people of Nagorny Karabakh,\r\nwho were fighting for their homes, their families, their\r\nsecurity, their lives and their futures. The armaments of\r\nAzerbaijan did not then  and cannot ever  break\r\nthe will of the people of Nagorny Karabakh to live\r\nfreely on their own land.\r\nIndeed, Azerbaijanis are victims, but of their own\r\naggression. They started the war, one-sidedly. They began\r\nmassacring Armenians, citizens of the Azerbaijani cities\r\nof Sumgait, Baku and Ganja  the most irresponsible\r\nreaction that a Government can undertake, using the\r\nmost inhuman methods associated with pogroms.\r\nThe war that followed changed the world for two\r\ngenerations of Armenians, who have never lived under\r\nAzerbaijani rule. Azerbaijans leadership, old and new,\r\nrather than remaining prisoners to the Soviet era  which\r\nthey themselves rejected as historically illegitimate  can\r\nlook to a future of compromise, peace, regional\r\ncooperation and prosperous, stable development.\r\nArmenia intends to go forward. Indeed, we\r\nalready have. The year 2003 has been a very good year\r\nfor Armenia. On the economic front, our steady,\r\ndouble-digit growth rate is the fastest in the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States and in Europe.\r\nThis has led some to call Armenia the Caucasian tiger.\r\nWe are pleased with the name and the challenge. We\r\nknow that with economic growth comes an even\r\ngreater responsibility: to confront the social gaps which\r\ncan lead to social inequality and domestic instability.\r\nThe shortest path to the eradication of transitional ills\r\nsuch as the polarization of society, the urban-rural gap\r\nand uneven access to higher education is to sustain that\r\nhigh level of economic growth.\r\nThat is why, with the help of the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, we embarked on the\r\nsustainable economic development programme. That is\r\nwhy the Government has approved and launched a\r\npoverty reduction strategy. It is also why achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals for poverty eradication,\r\nthe awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and the\r\nempowerment of women is an important part of\r\nArmenias development strategy.\r\nIn Armenia, the United Nations plays a key role\r\nin promoting synergies directed at expanding the\r\ndevelopment impact of information and\r\ncommunications technologies. As we prepare for the\r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society in December\r\nin Geneva, Armenia is living a hopeful paradox. On the\r\none hand, less than half of our more than one thousand\r\nschools are connected to the Internet; on the other\r\nhand, information and communications technologies\r\n(ICTs) comprise a significant proportion of Armenias\r\nexports today. Still, too many in our country  just\r\nlike the majority of the world population  still remain\r\nuntouched by the ICT revolution and its potential.\r\nWe recognize, of course, that ICTs can be central\r\nin economies like ours, especially given the continuing\r\nblockade. Our economic growth has continued despite\r\nthe blockade, which goes against the spirit and the\r\nconclusions of the recent United Nations sponsored\r\nInternational Ministerial Conference on Transit\r\nTransport Cooperation, which reaffirmed the right of\r\naccess by landlocked countries to and from the sea and\r\ntheir freedom of transit through the territory of their\r\nneighbours by all means of transport, in accordance\r\nwith the applicable rules of international law. For us,\r\nthat means a condemnation of the practice of unilateral\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\ncoercive economic measures intended as political\r\npressure.\r\nThis was also a good year for our legislative\r\nreform process. The Armenian parliament has ratified\r\nthe Sixth Protocol of the European Convention for the\r\nProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental\r\nFreedoms, thus unconditionally abolishing the death\r\npenalty. We also adopted the draft law on the\r\nombudsman, thus empowering our citizens and\r\ninvesting them with the faith necessary to govern with\r\njustice and to be governed with dignity.\r\nAnother matter that is important for us and for all\r\nhumanity: Armenia continues to engage countries and\r\nGovernments around the world to recognize and\r\ncondemn the first genocide of the twentieth century.\r\nThe survivors of the genocide and their descendants are\r\nhelping to build a democratic Armenia, committed to\r\nthe future without forgetting the past.\r\nWhen Sergio Vieira de Mello visited Armenia\r\nseveral years ago, he came looking for ways to\r\nminimize the pain and suffering of Armenian refugees\r\nforced to flee their homes in Baku and Sumgait in\r\nAzerbaijan. This year, as he worked to minimize the\r\npain and suffering of the people of Iraq, to help them\r\nrebuild their country and their Government, he and too\r\nmany of his colleagues lost their lives. His death and\r\nthat of Anna Lindh of Sweden remind us that ideas,\r\nmore than people, scare and threaten. Those two brutal\r\nmurders also suggest to us louder than any\r\ndemonstration that the leadership of the world still has\r\nmuch to do in engaging the rejectionists, the extremists\r\nand the cynical. Our positive, forward-looking,\r\ndetermined steps here in the General Assembly will go\r\na long way towards convincing them.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Cimoszewicz (Poland): At the outset, like\r\nmy colleague from Armenia, I would like to express\r\nmy highest tribute to the memory of the outstanding\r\nindividuals whose tragic loss is a blow to the international\r\ncommunity that is absolutely beyond repair.\r\nThe assassination of Anna Lindh, the Foreign\r\nMinister of Sweden, has demonstrated once again the\r\nrisk involved in noble dedication to public service in a\r\nworld exposed to senseless acts of violence and has\r\nfilled people all over the world with the deepest sorrow.\r\nThe death of Sergio Vieira de Mello and his staff\r\nmembers came as a shock to the international community.\r\nThe question is, why were they killed? That horrible act\r\nof terror seems to be highly symbolic because, in the\r\nwords of the Secretary-General, it directly challenges\r\nthe vision of global solidarity and collective security\r\nrooted in the Charter of the United Nations. Sadly, that\r\nis the context in which we must address the concerns\r\non our domestic and international agendas.\r\nLast year, when addressing the Assembly, I put\r\nforward a proposal to prepare a new act for the United\r\nNations at the dawn of the twenty-first century. I was\r\npersuaded then, as I am now, that such a document\r\ncould give fresh impetus to the principles and\r\nmechanisms of the United Nations in a changing world.\r\nIt should entail the elaboration of a new catalogue of\r\nnorms of international conduct in the face of the\r\nsecurity threats and global challenges of today.\r\nDevelopments on the international scene since I\r\nput forward that initiative have strengthened my belief\r\nthat the United Nations would only benefit from a new,\r\nstrong political signal reconfirming its role as a beacon\r\nof stability and a reliable instrument for managing\r\nchange.\r\nI believe that the best way to create the proper\r\nconditions for an unconstrained debate on the future of\r\nthe United Nations is to engage outstanding public\r\nfigures of international stature in an informal setting. I\r\nsuggested at the time that a group of eminent\r\npersonalities be charged with the task of producing an\r\noutline of the document, which would then be submitted\r\nfor assessment by Member States. The composition of the\r\ngroup should ensure its independence, appropriate\r\nintellectual format and knowledge of international\r\naffairs. In addition, such a groups excellent moral\r\nstanding and political weight would guarantee that the\r\ndocument designed to serve as an inspiration to\r\nMember States would be of the highest value. Thus, an\r\nessentially intellectual exercise initiated outside the\r\ninstitutional framework of the United Nations could be\r\ntransformed into a political process, culminating in the\r\nadoption of the new act by the General Assembly.\r\nI remain deeply convinced that despite the rapid\r\nchanges in the international environment precipitated\r\nespecially after 11 September 2001, the United Nations\r\ntoday  almost 60 years after its foundation  should\r\nretain a central role as a mechanism for resolving global\r\nproblems and as a guarantor of international legitimacy.\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nIt is a great source of satisfaction for me that the\r\nPolish initiative corresponds to the thinking of the\r\nSecretary-General and his efforts to increase the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations and safeguard the\r\nposition of the Organization as the most important\r\ninstitution of international security and cooperation. I\r\nwholeheartedly support his views on the need for\r\nreview, and possibly a radical reform, of the\r\ninternational security architecture, as reflected in his\r\nlatest report on the implementation of the United\r\nNations Millennium Declaration (A/58/323), as well as\r\nhis timely proposals voiced at the outset of our debate.\r\nIndeed, we can no longer safely assume that our\r\ncurrent multilateral rules and institutions have the\r\ncapacity to confront the current array of old and new\r\nthreats to peace and security.\r\nSince I presented my proposal last September, we\r\nhave consulted extensively with governmental\r\nrepresentatives from a number of countries. A rich\r\ncollection of suggestions and comments has been\r\ncompiled that will be invaluable in developing the\r\ninitiative. In the consultation process, we were\r\nencouraged by the shared view of many countries as to\r\nthe need to adapt the United Nations to current\r\nchallenges.\r\nTaking into account the initial outcome of the\r\nconsultations, the Government of the Republic of\r\nPoland has produced a memorandum in which we have\r\nsketched a proposed outline of the mandate of the\r\nGroup of Sages.\r\nThe initiative, as reflected in the memorandum, is\r\nin effect an invitation to a conceptual and holistic\r\nreflection on the nature of changes in the international\r\nsystem and on the most desirable vision of a new, more\r\neffective international order. It deals with the questions\r\nposed by a whole spectrum of present-day challenges,\r\nincluding security risks related to globalization and the\r\nemergence of non-State actors, the development gap and\r\ninternational solidarity, governance and subsidiarity.\r\nThe novel character of todays challenges calls\r\nfor new ways of thinking and an innovative approach.\r\nIt is true that protracted regional conflicts remain a\r\nvery serious source of instability. Yet, along with those\r\ntraditional threats, todays security environment has\r\nbeen increasingly dominated by a combination of new\r\nthreats of a more diverse and unpredictable nature.\r\nThey originate mostly within State borders rather than\r\namong States, notably in failing and failed States that\r\nare unable to control their own territories, and they are\r\noften posed by non-State actors.\r\nTo use the Secretary-Generals terminology,\r\ntodays threats are both hard and soft, and they\r\ntend to reinforce one another. We are confronted with\r\nterrorism that has a global reach, motivated by\r\nextremist ideology and unconstrained in its readiness to\r\ninflict massive casualties. We are facing a growing risk\r\nof proliferation of deadly weapons and the spread of\r\norganized crime that often accompanies State failure.\r\nThese hard challenges are compounded by chronic\r\nunderdevelopment in many parts of the world.\r\nSoft threats, such as widespread poverty,\r\ndeprivation, hunger, malnutrition and rampant\r\ninfectious diseases, take their tragic toll on peoples\r\nliving in countries with poor economic growth. These\r\nare usually found in regions where development is\r\noften thwarted by bad governance and violent internal\r\nconflicts that result in large-scale humanitarian crises,\r\nmassive abuses of human rights, political and social\r\ndisruption and, ultimately, the collapse of State systems.\r\nIn the face of the new realities confronting the\r\ninternational community, we need to forge a consensus\r\non the conceptual and political framework for the\r\noperation of the United Nations in upcoming decades.\r\nIn this context, let me stress that my initiative is not\r\nintended to revise or change the United Nations\r\nCharter, which should remain the basis of international\r\nrelations. Instead, the New Political Act should place\r\nthe Charter in the context of the ongoing transformations\r\ntaking place in the international environment. It should\r\nprovide a new conceptual framework for, and political\r\ninterpretation of, the Charter, adapting the United\r\nNations to present-day realities and regulating the\r\nOrganizations activities in those areas that are not\r\ncovered by the Charter. It should accomplish that goal\r\nby redefining the objectives of the United Nations,\r\nidentifying new tasks and specifying operational\r\nmodalities for the Organization.\r\nThe Millennium Declaration was a clear\r\nmanifestation of the ability of the Organization to take\r\nup new tasks and confront the most pressing\r\nchallenges. We must make every effort to increase the\r\ncapacity of the United Nations to achieve the goals set\r\nout in that landmark document, and I believe that the\r\nNew Act could add a political impetus to the\r\ncontinuous work under way to fully implement the\r\nDeclaration. Yet our experience in the post-cold-war\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nera made clear not just problems related to the capacity\r\nof the United Nations, but also the lack of clarity and\r\nconsensus on certain principles essential for effective\r\naction in the new security environment.\r\nA source of serious concern is the fact that the\r\nlack of an agreed and common interpretation of many\r\nterms and principles which are fundamental in the\r\ninternational domain could lead to chaos in\r\ninternational relations. The New Act for the United\r\nNations  while taking into account the current\r\nchanges in the international order  should therefore\r\nreflect the relations between numerous principles and\r\nthe international conditions dominated by non-\r\ntraditional threats. It should examine, for example,\r\nquestions related to issues such as respect for human\r\nrights and the principle of State sovereignty, the right\r\nof self-determination and territorial integrity, conflicts\r\nand crisis management, and the principle of non-\r\ninterference in internal affairs. It should also address\r\nthe possibility of inscribing newly emerged concepts,\r\nsuch as human security and the responsibility of States\r\nto protect the vulnerable, into the conceptual basis of\r\nthe international system.\r\nIt is a painful reality that the United Nations is\r\ndeeply divided. This limits its effectiveness and\r\noccasionally even calls into question its ability to act.\r\nThe basic question is, therefore, how can we restore to\r\nthe United Nations the sense of unity and cohesion\r\nembodied in the very name of the Organization? How\r\ncan we prevent paralysis in management by the United\r\nNations of international security? And how can we\r\nadjust the operating principles of the Organization so\r\nas to enable those countries that are able and willing to\r\nrespond adequately to new threats to act within the\r\ninstitutional framework of the United Nations?\r\nIn my view, this difficult goal is unattainable\r\nwithout a reaffirmation of the United Nations as a\r\ncommunity of shared values and shared goals. Such a\r\nreaffirmation could reintegrate the Organization and\r\ninfuse it with a new sense of purpose. Hence, at the\r\ncore of my initiative there is a need for a profound\r\nreflection on the values and principles that bind the\r\ninternational community together and define the\r\nbehaviour of States towards each other, towards other\r\nactors on the international scene and towards their\r\ncitizens.\r\nLet me reiterate once again that Poland strongly\r\nsupports the Secretary-Generals intention to establish\r\na high-level panel of eminent personalities to examine\r\nthe role of collective action in countering current\r\nsecurity challenges and to review the operation of\r\nmajor United Nations organs, with a view to\r\nrecommending necessary reforms. This idea is in\r\nperfect conformity with my initiative. I believe that the\r\nideas which we collected in the course of last year,\r\nreflected both in the memorandum of the Polish\r\nGovernment and in the responses of leading experts\r\nand scholars, could provide a good starting point and\r\nmake a useful contribution to the work of the panel.\r\nI wish to affirm the strong commitment of my\r\ncountry to ensure the successful outcome of the\r\nSecretary-Generals initiative. I intend to convey the\r\naforementioned collected comments of eminent\r\nintellectuals on the future of the United Nations to the\r\nPanel for its consideration.\r\nThe war against the murderous regime of Saddam\r\nHussain has exposed, in a painful way, the challenges\r\nrelated to the principles and practice of multilateral\r\naction and has revealed the unresolved dilemmas in\r\nthis domain, which  in my view  should be\r\naddressed in the New Political Act for the United\r\nNations. For the time being, though, the international\r\ncommunity must focus its attention on the situation on\r\nthe ground. I believe that the United Nations should be\r\na key factor in post-war Iraqs transition to the rule of\r\nlaw, democracy and independence. The tremendous\r\ntask of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq\r\nshould be shared by the entire international community.\r\nWe must work out arrangements which will help\r\nIraq assume, as soon as possible, its rightful, dignified\r\nplace among the nations of the world. For its part,\r\nPoland remains committed to the stabilization effort in\r\nIraq. Our participation in that endeavour is guided by\r\nthe need to create the conditions for the Iraqi people to\r\ndetermine freely their own future and to begin a new\r\nchapter in the history of that great nation, leading it to\r\ndevelopment and prosperity.\r\nOn Monday, 29 September, the United Nations\r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime\r\nwill enter into force. I am proud that the idea put\r\nforward by Poland during the World Ministerial\r\nConference on Organized Transnational Crime, held at\r\nNaples in November 1994, was transformed  with\r\nthe broad support of the international community \r\ninto a binding United Nations Convention.\r\n35\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Benita Ferrero-\r\nWaldner, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Austria.\r\nMrs. Ferrero-Waldner (Austria): A few days\r\nago, the United Nations was again attacked in Baghdad\r\n just one month after the United Nations\r\nHeadquarters was targeted in a devastating terrorist\r\nattack. My heartfelt sympathies  not only as the\r\nForeign Minister of Austria, but also as a former staff\r\nmember working here at the Headquarters of the\r\nUnited Nations  go to the victims, their loved ones\r\nand all colleagues in the United Nations family. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and his colleagues died as heroes. As a\r\nhost country to the United Nations, Austria firmly\r\nsupports the Secretary-Generals call to provide the\r\nutmost security for United Nations personnel on\r\nmissions everywhere in the world. Those United\r\nNations staff members had dedicated their lives to\r\nhelping the most vulnerable. Today, we are called upon\r\nto live up to their cause.\r\nThis has also been a year of lethal attacks on\r\npoliticians who courageously stood for a human face\r\nfor politics. We remember, with sadness, the outstanding\r\nleadership qualities and invaluable contributions of Zoran\r\nDjindjic and Anna Lindh. We are equally saddened to\r\nlearn that Ms. Aquila al-Hashimi, member of the Iraqi\r\nGoverning Council, has succumbed to the wounds she\r\nsuffered in the recent terrorist attack.\r\nWhat is at stake today is the way in which the\r\nUnited Nations can best shoulder its responsibility for\r\nglobal security and peace and how we as Member\r\nStates can support the United Nations in this task.\r\nAustria, as one of the host countries of the United\r\nNations, feels a sense of responsibility for the future\r\nfunctioning of the Organization.\r\nThe intense public scrutiny of the Security\r\nCouncils actions over the past 12 months has opened a\r\nwindow of opportunity for re-launching our efforts to\r\nfind unity of purpose based on a common security\r\nagenda between all nations. In this context, I greatly\r\nwelcome the report of the Secretary-General on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration, which\r\nmakes one thing crystal clear: we face nothing less\r\nthan the need for a far-reaching overhaul of the United\r\nNations system in order to enhance efficiency and\r\nlegitimacy.\r\nWe must respond to this challenge and\r\nenergetically revive the reform debate. The urgency we\r\nare faced with today should render a new attempt more\r\nsuccessful.\r\nFirst of all, a priority issue should be the reform\r\nof the procedures of the United Nations system. The\r\ncomposition of the Security Council is at odds with the\r\ngeopolitical reality of the twenty-first century. It does\r\nnot reflect the growing number of United Nations\r\nMembers or the necessary regional balance. Decision-\r\nmaking is therefore perceived by many as lacking\r\nlegitimacy. In my view, this discussion is not only\r\nabout who should be represented in the Security\r\nCouncil, but  and this is at least as important \r\nabout ensuring that the decision-making is in the\r\ninterests of world peace and global security. In this\r\ncontext the regional groups have to accept their\r\nresponsibility by coming forward with solutions.\r\nAs a member of the European Union, which is\r\nabout to give itself a constitution for the twenty-first\r\ncentury, it is important to note that we are moving\r\ngradually towards a genuine common foreign and\r\nsecurity policy. To this end, a security doctrine is being\r\nelaborated by High Representative and Secretary\r\nGeneral Solana for the European Council. Speaking\r\nwith one voice also means more common positions in\r\nSecurity Council matters. This logic might one day\r\neven lead to the European Union having a seat on the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nAustria sees its national interest best served by\r\nthe multilateral approach of a strong United Nations\r\nsystem, with the Security Council living up to its\r\nresponsibility for world peace and with the primacy of\r\ninternational law and the universality of human rights\r\nmaintained by all.\r\nInternational terrorism is a direct and lethal threat\r\nto global and collective security. The terror attacks of\r\n11 September 2001, and those against the United\r\nNations Headquarters in Baghdad, have one thing in\r\ncommon: they were targeted against civilization as a\r\nwhole. United Nations leadership is needed more than\r\never to prevent and combat terrorism globally. In the\r\nUnited Nations system-wide division of labour, the\r\nVienna-based Terrorism Prevention Branch of the\r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime contributes to counter-\r\nterrorism efforts and offers valuable technical\r\nassistance to States with regard to signing, ratifying\r\nand implementing international conventions and\r\nprotocols related to terrorism.\r\n36\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nAnother hard threat to international security is the\r\nproliferation of arms, in particular the spread of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. What is needed is\r\nobvious: the strengthening and universalization of\r\nexisting disarmament, non-proliferation and export\r\ncontrol regimes. As a practical contribution to this\r\ncause, Austria has agreed to serve as an immediate\r\ncentral contact for the 109 subscriber States of the\r\nHague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile\r\nProliferation.\r\nFurthermore, the Conference on Facilitating the\r\nEntry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty, which I had the honour to open on 3\r\nSeptember, appealed, in its Final Declaration, to all\r\nStates to sign and ratify that Treaty, in particular to\r\nthose 12 countries whose ratification is required for the\r\nTreatys entry into force. Let me repeat and support\r\nthat appeal.\r\nIn the field of non-proliferation, the work of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under the\r\nleadership of Director General Mohamed ElBaradei is\r\nessential. Last weeks General Conference of IAEA\r\nunanimously endorsed the necessity of strengthening\r\nthe international nuclear safeguards system. Recent\r\nissues of compliance concerning Iran and the\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea have again\r\nshown the central role of IAEA.\r\nOne of the most important immediate tasks is the\r\nstabilization and reconstruction of Iraq. We are\r\nconvinced that success in the aim of restoring the\r\nsovereignty of Iraq as quickly as possible will hardly\r\nbe feasible without the United Nations playing its part\r\non the basis of a sound, viable and coherent policy.\r\nIn line with the human security approach, Austria\r\nwas among the first to offer humanitarian aid. In\r\nAustrian hospitals we provided urgent medical\r\nassistance for children in critical condition.\r\nFurthermore, Austria participates in the Adopt a\r\nHospital programme and is about to equip two\r\nhospitals in Nazariyah. Together with Slovenia and\r\nJordan, we are preparing the establishment, south of\r\nBaghdad, of a centre for war-traumatized children.\r\nThese are efforts aimed at providing relief for the\r\nweakest and most vulnerable members of Iraqi society.\r\nIn spite of renewed efforts by the international\r\ncommunity to revive the Middle East peace process,\r\nthe conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has\r\nagain tragically deteriorated. But current setbacks must\r\nnot stall the implementation of the road map. Austria\r\ncontinues to strongly support the role and the\r\nresponsibility of the Quartet. The concept of two States\r\nremains the only viable solution. The promise of land for\r\npeace must be reactivated to create a basis of trust and\r\nrespect on which to build. Terrorism destroys such hope.\r\nI turn now to what the Secretary-General called\r\nsoft threats. Here, his report coincides with the goals of\r\nmy recently concluded presidency of the Human\r\nSecurity Network to strengthen the universal system by\r\nforging interregional consensus on issues pertaining to\r\nhuman security. That places the individual human\r\nbeing and his or her protection at the centre of our\r\npolicies. As a concrete result of my presidency, the\r\nministers of the Network adopted a manual on human\r\nrights education. That unique training tool, based on\r\nthe universality of human rights, is designed for global\r\nuse and adaptable to target groups. The Network also\r\nadopted a strategy for supporting children affected by\r\narmed conflict, along with a training curriculum for\r\nchild rights experts and a compendium of the relevant\r\ninternational child protection standards  an effort in\r\nwhich we cooperated closely with the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Olara Otunnu.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals have\r\nbecome fundamental benchmarks in our efforts to\r\nachieve more inclusive and equitable globalization, and\r\nwe  both developing and developed countries \r\nneed to strive for their implementation at the global,\r\nregional and national levels. In that context, as part of\r\nthe partnership effort agreed to in Monterrey, I am\r\nhappy to announce that Austrian official development\r\nassistance will be increased by 35 per cent in 2004.\r\nThe Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment recognized the importance of energy for\r\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nAustria welcomes the additional impetus created by the\r\nRenewables 2004 Conference. I am also glad that the\r\nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership\r\nwill establish its secretariat in Vienna. Meanwhile,\r\nAustria will use the synergies created by these\r\nactivities to continue its endeavours to build up the\r\ncapacity of the Global Forum on Sustainable Energy,\r\nwhich I launched in 1999.\r\nAt this point, let me express Austrias\r\ndisappointment that the Ministerial Meeting in Cancún\r\ncould not sustain the momentum towards achieving\r\nacceptable solutions for fair trade. Such a setback must\r\n37\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nnot repeat itself, not least because trade is an engine for\r\ndevelopment. I support the notion that we also need to\r\nbegin a reform of the decision-making process within\r\nthe World Trade Organization. We must avoid a\r\ntendency towards ending multilateralism and towards\r\nrelying exclusively on bilateralism or regionalism in\r\ntrade.\r\nThis year, we commemorate the tenth anniversary\r\nof the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human\r\nRights, which confirmed the universality, indivisibility\r\nand interrelatedness of human rights as well as the\r\nimportant nexus among human rights, democracy and\r\ndevelopment. Human rights disasters that we have\r\nwitnessed since  such as those in Rwanda and\r\nSrebrenica  must not be allowed to recur. One\r\nessential step in that regard is the Optional Protocol to\r\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,\r\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,\r\nwhich I signed this morning.\r\nHuman rights must protect in particular the weak,\r\nwomen and children. As a woman and as Foreign\r\nMinister of my country, I have always spoken out in\r\nfavour of the rights of women and against the\r\nfrequently terrible infringements of those rights, such\r\nas genital mutilation, the stoning of women and the\r\nenslaving and trading of women and girls on the sex\r\nmarkets. Those horrendous practices must stop. And\r\nthere is reason for hope: today is a good day for\r\nwomens rights. News has reached us that Ms. Armina\r\nLawal was acquitted by the Nigerian court. I am very\r\nhappy about that outcome. Let us remind ourselves that\r\nthe all-important fight against terrorism must not entail\r\na lessening of hard-fought-for human rights standards.\r\nOver the years and under the guidance of the\r\nSecretary-General, Austria has placed great importance\r\non a comprehensive dialogue of cultures and\r\ncivilizations. This November, I will host a second\r\nmedia seminar on the topic of Cultural diversity: the\r\nquest for common moral ground and the public role of\r\nthe media, exploring how the free media can\r\ncontribute to cultural understanding and respect. A\r\nseminal event in the context of that dialogue was the\r\nfirst-ever conference of European Islamic leaders in\r\nAustria, held in June of this year, which adopted a\r\nstrongly worded declaration in support of tolerance.\r\nHow can we contribute to stability in the regions\r\nof the world? Europe has its own experience with\r\ncreating a zone of stability and welfare. The signing of\r\nthe European Union (EU) accession treaty with 10 new\r\nprospective members in April of this year is an\r\nimportant contribution to security on our continent.\r\nThe strategy of EU is also geared towards exporting\r\nthat peace dividend to new neighbours of the enlarged\r\nEU further to the east and to the south-east and in the\r\nMediterranean region. Let me highlight one\r\nencouraging event from that region, which I was able\r\nto witness from a close vantage point when I visited\r\nBelgrade less than two weeks ago. I am talking about\r\nthe important gesture of President Marović of Serbia\r\nand Montenegro and of President Mesić of Croatia,\r\napologizing on behalf of those of their countries\r\ncitizens, who had committed acts of violence against\r\none another in recent history.\r\nThe vision of global solidarity, collective security\r\nand a global culture of human rights are rooted in the\r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\r\nand of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I\r\nam grateful to the Secretary-General for his courage\r\nand leadership to engage us in an honest, future-\r\noriented debate. The time to act is now. I can again\r\nassure the Secretary-General that Austria supports him\r\nin that important endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Yoon Young-kwan, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Yoon Young-kwan (Republic of Korea): I\r\nshould like first of all to express my heartiest\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Julian Hunte on his election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession. I have no doubt that, under his able\r\nstewardship, we will be able to achieve a great deal\r\nduring this important session. I should also like to\r\nthank Mr. Jan Kavan for his dedication and hard work\r\nduring the last session.\r\nThe past year has witnessed the fall of a decades-\r\nlong dictatorship in Iraq. The Iraqi people have\r\nregained their freedom and are now embarking upon\r\nthe arduous process of rebuilding their nation.\r\nHowever, the auspicious political changes brought on\r\nin Iraq will hold real meaning for the Iraqi people and\r\nthe regional order only once they are able to enjoy the\r\nsocial economic benefits of a broadly based functional\r\ndemocratic Government. To that end, the Republic of\r\nKorea is now playing its part in the process of\r\nrehabilitation and reconstruction.\r\n38\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nThe situation in todays Iraq is, however, less\r\nthan promising. The recent surge of terror and chaos\r\nhas served as a sobering reminder that winning the war\r\ndoes not necessarily mean winning peace.\r\nAs the terrorist attack against the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad last month so vividly\r\ndemonstrated, the prevalence of violence and terrorism\r\nposes the most pressing challenge that Iraq has to\r\novercome in building a democratic, peaceful and\r\nprosperous nation. The Republic of Korea strongly\r\ncondemns the atrocious act of terrorism against United\r\nNations personnel who came to Iraq for the sole\r\npurpose of assisting the Iraqi people.\r\nWe recommend that the Secretary-General take\r\nthe necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of\r\nthe United Nations and its associated personnel, as well\r\nas international humanitarian workers in Iraq, as they\r\ncarry out their noble duties.\r\nDespite the persistence of conflict and turmoil,\r\nthe international community has continued during the\r\npast year to make progress in strengthening the\r\nuniversal values of human rights and democracy. The\r\nspread of universal values in turn strengthens the\r\nfoundation for peace and prosperity around the world.\r\nHowever, a world in which all peoples enjoy their\r\nfull rights and dignity is far from being a reality. We\r\nneed to make concerted efforts to promote human\r\ndignity as the guiding precept of the world community.\r\nThe Republic of Korea remains firmly committed\r\nto international efforts to advance democracy around\r\nthe world. In this vein, Seoul hosted the Second\r\nMinisterial Conference of the Community of\r\nDemocracies in November last year, as well as the\r\nThird Global Forum on Fighting Corruption and\r\nSafeguarding Integrity in May this year. We will\r\ncontinue to actively participate in efforts to promote\r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance.\r\nThe challenges facing us include fighting poverty\r\nand achieving sustainable development. Poverty\r\nundermines human dignity. It provides fertile ground\r\nfor conflict and dictatorship. The need for international\r\ncooperation in this area has never been greater.\r\nIt is therefore tremendously important to achieve\r\nthe goals set at last years International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development and the World Summit on\r\nSustainable Development. The international community\r\nmust exercise collective wisdom to attain tangible results\r\nin working toward these goals.\r\nIn recent years, the growing number of people\r\nmoving freely across borders has alerted us to the\r\nincreasing threats to public health. As demonstrated by\r\nthe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic,\r\ninfectious diseases have become a global issue from\r\nwhich no country is immune. It is timely and fitting\r\nthat a high-level meeting was held earlier this week on\r\nthe follow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth\r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS.\r\nIn our common fight against infectious diseases, I\r\nwould like to call your attention to the International\r\nVaccine Institute, which has been headquartered in\r\nSeoul since 1997. This unique international\r\norganization, devoted to the development of new\r\nvaccines needed in developing countries, awaits the\r\nsupport of the international community as it continues\r\nto expand its activities to promote public health for the\r\nless privileged of the world.\r\nOn the global security front, the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction (WMD) and its\r\npotentially devastating linkage to terrorism loom as a\r\ngrave and perilous threat. The global nuclear non-\r\nproliferation regime based on the Nuclear Non-\r\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) currently faces\r\nunprecedented challenges.\r\nHow we deal with these challenges will have a\r\ndecisive bearing on the future of not only the non-\r\nproliferation regime, but also the international security\r\nenvironment as a whole. Recent cases have proven that\r\nthe existing nuclear non-proliferation regime has\r\ninherent limitations when it comes to dealing with\r\ndetermined proliferators.\r\nWhile reiterating the importance of achieving the\r\nuniversality of the NPT and strengthening the\r\nsafeguards system through universal adherence to the\r\nAdditional Protocol to the Safeguards Agreements of\r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), we\r\nunderscore the need to close the loopholes in the\r\ncurrent regime.\r\nIn this regard, we stress the vital role of bilateral,\r\nmultilateral and regional approaches among countries\r\nsharing common security interests in the reinforcement\r\nand supplementing of the NPT. The role of export control\r\narrangements among potential suppliers of relevant\r\ncomponents and technologies for WMD is also crucial.\r\n39\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nTo that end, my Government hosted a plenary\r\nmeeting of the Nuclear Suppliers Group last May and\r\nwill also host a plenary meeting of the Missile\r\nTechnology Control Regime next year.\r\nWe further believe that the nuclear-weapon States\r\ncan do a great service to the cause of non-proliferation\r\nby complying with their share of the nuclear\r\ndisarmament obligations under the NPT and by\r\nworking harder to achieve the early entry into force of\r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nThe security of North-East Asia is currently\r\nthreatened by the possibility of the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction. The Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Koreas nuclear programme not only poses\r\na direct challenge to the security of the Korean\r\npeninsula, but also endangers peace and stability in\r\nNorth-East Asia and beyond. The Republic of Korea is\r\nstrongly committed to the denuclearization of the\r\nKorean peninsula, and our position on the nuclear issue\r\nin the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea remains\r\nclear and consistent.\r\nFirst, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea\r\nmust dismantle its nuclear programme in a complete,\r\nirreversible and verifiable manner. Secondly, the\r\nnuclear issue with the Democratic Peoples Republic of\r\nKorea must be resolved in a peaceful and diplomatic\r\nmanner.\r\nThe heightening of military tension on the Korean\r\npeninsula will be detrimental to all of the countries in\r\nthe region. Fifty years after the end of the Korean War,\r\nour people still feel the pain. We must not allow such a\r\ntragedy ever to be repeated.\r\nBy opting to combine efforts to resolve this\r\nmatter peacefully and diplomatically, the international\r\ncommunity has shown great wisdom in dealing with\r\nthis pressing and important matter. These efforts were\r\nculminated in the six-party talks held in Beijing last\r\nmonth.\r\nGiven the complexity of the issue, the multilateral\r\ntalks were significant, in that all participants were able\r\nto reach consensus on certain principles that will guide\r\ntheir future discussions.\r\nAmong these principles my Government\r\nwelcomes, in particular, the consensus on the necessity\r\nof both the de-nuclearization of the peninsula and a\r\npeaceful resolution through dialogue.\r\nThe tasks ahead will be to maintain the\r\nmomentum of dialogue and to refine these agreed\r\nprinciples in greater detail. There will indeed be\r\ndifficulties in bridging the differences at future talks.\r\nTo overcome these obstacles a spirit of cooperation\r\nmust prevail, and any action that may aggravate the\r\nsituation must be avoided.\r\nThe success of the six-party talks would not only\r\nbring the resolution of the nuclear issue regarding the\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea, but should\r\nalso lead to the process of creating a durable peace on\r\nthe Korean peninsula.\r\nMore than 10 years after the end of the cold war,\r\nthe peninsula remains the last theatre of the cold war,\r\nwith 1.5 million heavily armed troops still pointing\r\nguns across the demilitarized zone (DMZ) that\r\nseparates the Republic of Korea in the south and the\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea in the north. It\r\nis time for this 50-year stand-off to give way to\r\nreconciliation and cooperation. This process should be\r\ncautiously managed and occur peacefully and gradually.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to draw on lessons\r\nfrom the history of Europe that could be helpful in\r\ndefining the future of inter-Korean relations. As we all\r\nknow, in the century leading up to the Second World\r\nWar, relations between France and Germany were\r\ncharacterized by the hostilities and confrontation of\r\nthree major wars.\r\nAfter the Second World War, however, the\r\ncountries of Europe joined forces to help the two rivals\r\nsettle their differences and to pursue peace and\r\ncommon prosperity through a network of economic\r\ninterdependence.\r\nThanks to the vision of Jean Monnet and Robert\r\nSchuman, the European Coal and Steel Community\r\ncame into being and has since developed and expanded\r\nto become the unprecedented, multilateral institution of\r\nintegration known today as the European Union.\r\nTo be sure, the case of the Korean Peninsula is\r\ndifferent from that of Europe. Nevertheless, as in the\r\ncase of Europe, I believe that a resolution to the\r\npolitical conflict between the two sides of Korea could\r\nbe facilitated by economic interdependence.\r\nPresident Roh Moo-hyuns policy toward the\r\nNorth, aptly termed the policy for peace and prosperity,\r\nis directly aimed at resolving the political confrontation\r\nbetween the South and North through the deepening of\r\n40\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\ninter-Korean economic interdependence and with the\r\ncooperation of the international community.\r\nHowever, the nuclear programme of the\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea has emerged as\r\nthe most serious challenge to the process of\r\nconsolidating peace and prosperity on the Korean\r\nPeninsula. We in the Republic of Korea sincerely hope\r\nthat the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea will\r\nrealize that it simply cannot achieve economic\r\nprosperity without fully abandoning its intentions to\r\ndevelop nuclear weapons.\r\nWe note that all participants at the Beijing six-\r\nparty talks acknowledged the need to address the\r\nsecurity concerns of the Democratic Peoples Republic\r\nof Korea, and we ask the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea to make a wise and far-reaching\r\ndecision in this regard. We strongly hope that the\r\nsecurity concerns of the North, along with the nuclear\r\nissue, will be dealt with in more detail at the next six-\r\nparty talks.\r\nOnce the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea\r\nabandons its nuclear weapon programme and seizes the\r\nopportunity offered by the six-party talks to embark on\r\na path towards peace and prosperity, my Government\r\nwill take further steps towards bold inter-Korean\r\neconomic cooperation.\r\nThe international community will also provide\r\nnecessary humanitarian and economic assistance. The\r\npositive impact of such cooperation and assistance will\r\nresound not only on the Peninsula but throughout the\r\nregion and beyond.\r\nIn conclusion, the abandonment by the Democratic\r\nPeoples Republic of Korea of its nuclear programme\r\nthrough the six-party talks and the subsequent start of\r\nthe peace process on the Korean Peninsula will present\r\nan unprecedented opportunity to dramatically enhance\r\ninternational relations in East Asia.\r\nIn this regard, we look forward to the support of\r\nall Member States of the United Nations for the success\r\nof the six-party talks and the establishment of a lasting\r\npeace on the Korean Peninsula.\r\nThe United Nations has much work to do in the\r\ntwenty-first century. The global body is our greatest\r\nhope in our common efforts to make the world safer\r\nand more prosperous, for us and for future generations.\r\nI sincerely hope to see the United Nations renew itself\r\nand achieve its goals through continuous reform that\r\nwill make it more effective and democratic. The\r\nRepublic of Korea pledges its abiding support to the\r\nwork of the United Nations in its noble mission for\r\nmankind as a whole.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate.\r\nA number of representatives have asked to speak\r\nin exercise of the right of reply. May I remind members\r\nthat, in accordance with General Assembly decision\r\n34/401, statements in exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second and should be made by\r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who\r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply.\r\nMr. Akram (Pakistan): In his address before the\r\nAssembly yesterday, the President of Pakistan offered\r\nan action plan for peace between Pakistan and India.\r\nHe invited India to open a dialogue with Pakistan. He\r\noffered a reciprocal ceasefire along the Line of Control\r\nin Kashmir. He offered to encourage a ceasefire within\r\nIndian-occupied Kashmir. He offered enhanced\r\nmonitoring of the Line of Control on both sides in\r\nKashmir, and he proposed the maintenance of an arms\r\nbalance, both in conventional and non-conventional\r\nsectors, between India and Pakistan.\r\nThe response that we heard today from the\r\ndistinguished Prime Minister of India was sadly\r\ndisappointing  disappointing for Pakistan and, I am\r\nsure, disappointing for the international community. By\r\nthis negative response, we have lost another\r\nopportunity to build peace in South Asia.\r\nInstead, Pakistans offer of help to promote a\r\ncessation of hostilities within Indian-occupied Kashmir\r\nwas sadly misconstrued and misinterpreted by the\r\ndistinguished Prime Minister of India as an admission\r\nof guilt. This is preposterous.\r\nThe Kashmiri struggle is between India and the\r\nKashmiri people. Eighty thousand Kashmiris have been\r\nkilled in Kashmir with impunity by 700,000 Indian\r\noccupation forces. These Kashmiris are buried in the\r\ngraveyards of Kashmir, not in Pakistan. India wants the\r\nkilling to continue, because it believes that even now,\r\nafter 12 years of failed suppression, that it can\r\nintimidate the Kashmiris into giving up their struggle\r\nfor liberty. India, like all other colonial oppressors of the\r\npast, is surely mistaken. Kashmir will be free one day.\r\n41\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nThe dialogue that Pakistan has proposed to India\r\nis one of peace. It is not a favour to Pakistan. It is the\r\nonly mechanism envisaged by our Charter to promote\r\nthe easing of tension and the resolution of conflict.\r\nSadly, the Indian Prime Minister rejected this\r\nreasonable offer for peace. This reflects the negative\r\nstance of the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party\r\n(BJP), in India. The purpose of the so-called hard line\r\nin New Delhi is not to deal with cross-border terrorism.\r\nIt is designed to yield electoral gains for the Indian\r\nruling party in forthcoming State elections.\r\nThe BJPs political strategy was born of its\r\nvictory in the recent elections in Gujarat, where it\r\ngained popularity after the State-managed massacre of\r\n2000 innocent Muslims. Thus is democracy being\r\nconverted in the service of genocide. This is how great\r\nprinciples are perverted when fascists assume power.\r\nThe BJPs fascist doctrine propounded by the likes of\r\nGowalkar is well known. This is a party of which one\r\nof the members assassinated Ghandi. It is the party that\r\ndestroyed the Babri mosque, a great citadel of the\r\nMuslim culture of India. Five members were convicted\r\nthe other day of this crime, although the deputy leader\r\nof the party was let off. At recent electoral rallies, the\r\nBJP has threatened to destroy 3000 other mosques\r\nacross India. A leader of the fascist group Shiv Sena,\r\nMr. Bal Thackeray, recently called for the formation of\r\ngroups to commit terrorist acts against Pakistan and the\r\nMuslims of India. He is still running free.\r\nPrime Minister Vajpayee has accused Pakistan of\r\nsponsoring terrorism in Kashmir. The Kashmiri\r\nstruggle for self-determination seeks to realize the\r\nimplementation of the resolutions of the Security\r\nCouncil calling on India to hold a plebiscite to enable\r\nthe Kashmiri people to determine their own destiny.\r\nThe Security Council has said that elections held under\r\nIndian occupation, even if they were ever to be fair,\r\nwould not be a substitute for the plebiscite under\r\nUnited Nations auspices. No election in Kashmir has\r\never been free or fair.\r\nIn accordance with United Nations decisions,\r\nalthough India continues to brutally suppress the\r\nKashmiri freedom struggle, the Kashmiris have a\r\nlegitimate right to resist Indian occupation by all\r\nmeans at their disposal. This struggle cannot be\r\ndenigrated or described as terrorist. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations has recently observed,\r\nInternationally, we are seeing an increasing\r\nuse of what I call the T-word  terrorism  to\r\ndemonize political opponents  We are seeing\r\ntoo many cases where States living in tension\r\nwith their neighbours make opportunistic use of\r\nthe fight against terrorism to threaten or justify\r\nnew military action on long-running disputes.\r\nSimilarly, States fighting various forms of\r\nunrest or insurgency are finding it tempting to\r\nabandon the slow, difficult, but sometimes\r\nnecessary processes of political negotiation for\r\nthe deceptively easy option of military action.\r\n(S/PV.4688, p. 3).\r\nOne can grant that India knows a lot about\r\nterrorism. It is, to use a popular saying, the mother of\r\nterrorism. It has sponsored terrorism against each one\r\nof its neighbours. Read the book entitled Indian\r\nIntervention in Sri Lanka: The Role of India’s\r\nIntelligence Agencies, by Rohan Gunaratna. He says\r\nthat more than 20,000 Tamil militants were based in\r\nIndia during the 80s; the first and second batch of\r\ntraining was provided by the Indian foreign\r\nintelligence agency in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal\r\nPradesh at two Indian military facilities. After that,\r\nthey set up their own training camps in southern India.\r\nLet us remember that the first suicide bombers came\r\nfrom this batch trained by India. The author writes,\r\nIn Bangladesh, in the Chittagong hills, in\r\nthe late 80s I met rebels who told me they had\r\nbeen instructed in both weaponry and psy-ops,\r\nthe term used by India, at a camp near Dehradun,\r\nin the Himalayan foothills.\r\nA decade and a half earlier, India had trained other\r\nrebels. In Kashmir, India has trained renegade\r\nKashmiris and sent them across the border into\r\nPakistan to commit terrorist acts. There are also well-\r\ndocumented reports that Indian agencies have\r\nsponsored and directed renegade groups of Kashmiris\r\nto perpetrate terrorist acts within Indian-occupied\r\nKashmir as a means of intimidating the Kashmiris and\r\ndefaming the Kashmiri freedom struggle. This has been\r\nrecorded by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty\r\nInternational and other organizations.\r\nThe Indian Prime Minister spoke of Pakistan\r\nseeking military parity. We do not; we seek military\r\nbalance. We are entitled to equal security and we urge\r\nIndias military suppliers not to spark another arms\r\nrace in the sub-continent.\r\n42\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nIt is our hope that, despite Prime Minister\r\nVajpayees statement today, cooler heads  if there are\r\nany in New Delhi  will reflect and will come to the\r\nconclusion that dialogue is the only answer to the\r\nproblems between India and Pakistan and that they will\r\nrespond positively to the offer made by the President of\r\nPakistan yesterday.\r\nMs. Abdelhady-Nasser (Palestine): The\r\nstatement made today by the representative of Israel\r\nwas replete with distortions and fabrications.\r\nMoreover, it conveyed Israels consistent and blatant\r\ncontempt for the international community as\r\nrepresented in this world body, including in this\r\nAssembly. The judgement of the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States upholding international law\r\nand international humanitarian law has once again been\r\ntreated with disdain.\r\nInstead of Israel changing its course and\r\ncomplying with international law, the international\r\ncommunity was told today that it must change its ways\r\nwhen it comes to upholding the law with regard to the\r\nquestion of Palestine. With such arrogance and such\r\ncontempt for even the most fundamental tenets of\r\ninternational law, including the United Nations Charter,\r\nIsrael has continued to act with impunity as it\r\ncontinues to carry out its more than 36-year military\r\ncolonial occupation of the Palestinian land and the\r\nPalestinian people.\r\nIt is the Israeli Government that has brought\r\ndiplomatic efforts to a standstill and that is the real\r\nobstacle to peace and stability. Indeed, they vilify and\r\nthreaten out leader and elected President because they\r\ndo not want a peace settlement, and not vice-versa. In\r\nfact, the Israeli Prime Minister, his Defence Minister\r\nand his Army Chief of Staff are, as is well known,\r\nresponsible for countless war crimes committed against\r\nthe Palestinian people. The Prime Minister himself has\r\nbeen deeply implicated in massacres against the\r\nPalestinian people. This is a Government full of\r\nextreme right-wingers, many espousing racist\r\nideologies and propagating incitement and intolerance,\r\nwith some even calling, publicly, for the expulsion or\r\ntransfer of the entire Palestinian population from the\r\noccupied territory.\r\nIt is the most right-wing Government in Israels\r\nshort history. Yet somehow we are asked to believe that\r\nthis is a Government that actually wants peace, when in\r\nfact all of its actions are to the contrary. The same\r\nGovernment that delivers flowery speeches about peace\r\nand beating swords into ploughshares continues to\r\nrelentlessly use its warplanes, helicopter gunships,\r\ntanks and bulldozers against the Palestinian people,\r\neven today killing more civilians, including a 3-year-\r\nold girl in Gaza. Moreover, we should recall that it is\r\nthe Israeli occupation that is the root cause of all the ills\r\nwe face today, including condemnable acts of terror.\r\nThe time limit prevents me from exploring in\r\ndetail all of the Israeli violations against the Palestinian\r\npeople or calculating what the proportional impact of\r\nthe number of deaths caused by the widespread\r\ndestruction inflicted on the Palestinian people by the\r\noccupying Power would be in comparison with other\r\ncountries, which the Israeli representative neglected to\r\ncalculate. Suffice it to say that there is no instrument of\r\ninternational law or noble legal principle that Israel has\r\nnot grossly violated, in terms of both its policies and its\r\nactions as a State and as an occupying Power. These\r\ninclude the acquisition of territory by war; colonial\r\npolicies and actions; the forcible transfer of people to\r\noccupied territory; systematic human rights violations,\r\nincluding wilful killings; State terrorism; collective\r\npunishment; discrimination against minorities; the\r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction; the violation of the sovereignty of many\r\nother States, including through military attacks and\r\nassassinations; money-laundering; trafficking in human\r\npersons and in small arms and light weapons; and the\r\nviolation of the basic and inalienable human right to\r\nself-determination.\r\nThus the picture before us is bleak. Today,\r\nhowever, there was a glimmer of hope. It was reported\r\nthat 27 Israeli air force pilots had submitted a letter to\r\ntheir commander refusing to carry out air strikes in\r\nPalestinian areas because such air strikes are illegal\r\nand immoral and condemning the continuing Israeli\r\noccupation. They  along with the army officers who\r\nhave refused to serve in the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritory and the many other Israelis who truly work for\r\npeace  represent a voice of conscience, and their\r\nprincipled stance gives us renewed hope in the\r\npossibility of actually achieving peace between the two\r\npeoples, regardless of the current Governments\r\npositions and actions.\r\nMr. Amirbayov (Azerbaijan): Azerbaijan regrets\r\nthat this rostrum has again been abused by Armenia in\r\norder to disseminate false information designed to gain\r\njustification for its immoral and repugnant State policy\r\n43\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nof gross violations of international law, including the\r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nArmenia continues to challenge the international\r\ncommunity and the Assembly by continuing its illegal\r\noccupation of Nagorny Karabakh and seven adjacent\r\nregions of Azerbaijan. It continues to ignore the will of\r\nthe international community, reflected in the four\r\nresolutions of the Security Council unequivocally\r\ndemanding Armenias immediate, unconditional and\r\ncomplete withdrawal from occupied territories. Today,\r\nwhen we all speak of the need to make the\r\nOrganization a better and more efficient tool in\r\npreserving international peace and security, we must\r\nthink seriously about how to make sure that aggressor\r\nStates like Armenia are brought to justice.\r\nThe Armenian Minister engaged in entertaining\r\nthe audience with poorly concocted myths regarding\r\nmy country. I will not take much of the Assemblys\r\ntime by exploring the whole anthology of Armenian\r\nmyths; rather, I will mention only a few.\r\nThe first myth is that Nagorny Karabakh has\r\nreached its long-time dream of becoming an\r\nindependent State. Everyone sitting in this Hall who\r\nknows a bit of the history of the Caucasus will agree\r\nthat Nagorny Karabakh has never been, and never will\r\nbe, either independent or affiliated with Armenia; it has\r\nalways been, and will continue to be, an integral part of\r\nAzerbaijan, and it has always been the heart of\r\nAzerbaijans culture, science, art and political life.\r\nThe second myth concerns the so-called blockade\r\nto which poor, long-suffering Armenia was subjected\r\nby its neighbours. Can we speak of a blockade when a\r\ncountry has access to several States in the outside\r\nworld and cannot enjoy normal economic relations\r\nwith one State whose territories it has occupied and\r\nwhose population it has brutally murdered since 1987?\r\nI shall not enumerate all those massacres; it will suffice\r\nto mention the Khojaly massacre of 1992, in which\r\n1,000 innocent civilians were massacred by Armenian\r\naggressors. And was it not the Azerbaijani territory of\r\nNakhchivan that was subjected to a blockade by\r\nArmenia only because it is populated by Azerbaijanis?\r\nThe third myth involves the so-called Key West\r\narrangement referred to by Minister Oskanian. Indeed,\r\nthe population of that small, quiet town should be very\r\nthankful to Armenia for such a great advertisement,\r\nwhich included amateurish political vocabulary. What\r\nthe representative of Armenia described as a\r\nbreakthrough is nothing other than Azerbaijans\r\ngenuine desire to pursue the negotiations that have\r\nbeen ongoing for more than 10 years, which should\r\nproduce a solution based on the norms and principles\r\nof international law.\r\nThe next myth is that Armenia has won the war\r\nand has annexed Nagorny Karabakh and other\r\nAzerbaijani territories, and that it will happily live with\r\nthe status quo for as long as it wishes. From this\r\nrostrum, I assure the Assembly that Azerbaijan will\r\nspare no effort to restore justice and its sovereignty\r\nwithin the borders recognized by the international\r\ncommunity. Not one inch of our land will be yielded to\r\nthe aggressor. I appreciate the fact that Armenia\r\nrealizes that fact very well. The special attention that\r\nthe Minister devoted to that aspect in his statement\r\nproves that the aggressor is indeed concerned about the\r\nevolving situation and about prospects in the not-too-\r\ndistant future. If anything, by occupying Azerbaijani\r\nterritories, Armenia has gained a deep sense of\r\napprehension and fear that it has bitten off more than it\r\ncan chew.\r\nAs for the money from the oil revenues that are\r\nallegedly being used for weapons, the Government of\r\nAzerbaijan, thanks to the neighbour that we are so\r\nunfortunate as to have, is forced to spend huge amounts\r\nof money  most recently, $70 million  to alleviate\r\nthe sufferings of nearly a million refugees and\r\ninternally displaced persons driven from their homes\r\nby Armenia aggressors. Yesterday, Prime Minister\r\nAliyev pointed that out clearly in his address.\r\nIn conclusion, let me, through the presidency,\r\nappeal to the self-proclaimed Caucasian tiger to come\r\ndown to earth and realize that it is in its own interests\r\nto forget the myths, to open its eyes and to abide by the\r\nspirit and the letter of the founding document of this\r\nHouse, the Charter of the United Nations. We are not in\r\na jungle, after all.\r\nMr. Hong Je-ryong (Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea): My delegation would like to\r\nexercise its right of reply with regard to the statement\r\nmade by the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea,\r\nwhich referred specifically to the nuclear issue. In\r\norder to help the Members present here to gain a\r\ncorrect understanding of this issue, I should like to\r\nsubmit the following.\r\nThe nuclear issue is, in essence, an outcome of the\r\nhostile policy of the United States to isolate and stifle the\r\n44\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea politically,\r\neconomically and militarily. The issue originated from\r\nthe deep-rooted hostility of the United States, which\r\ndenies our system and refuses to coexist peacefully\r\nwith the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.\r\nThe denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was\r\ninitiated by the Democratic Peoples Republic of\r\nKorea. The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is\r\nthus the ultimate goal of the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea and the earnest desire of the entire\r\nKorean nation. In that context, at the three-party talks,\r\nand at the six-party talks that followed, the Democratic\r\nPeoples Republic of Korea put forward realistic and\r\nreasonable proposals for attaining the goal of\r\ndenuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.\r\nThe proposal of the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea contained a detailed account of a\r\npackage deal and an order for simultaneous actions\r\naimed at the comprehensive and fair solution of the\r\nnuclear issue, including a change in the United States\r\nhostile policy towards the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea, the conclusion of a non-aggression\r\ntreaty between the Democratic Peoples Republic of\r\nKorea and the United States, the renunciation of the\r\nnuclear programme and the normalization of bilateral\r\nrelations. Simultaneous action is a realistic means of\r\ndenuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, and any objection\r\nto it is tantamount to a refusal.\r\nThe United States, however, repeatedly called for\r\nthe renunciation first by the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea of its nuclear programme, without\r\nany reference to a change in its hostile policy towards\r\nthe Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, which is\r\nthe key to the settlement of the nuclear issue.\r\nThe United States acted imprudently, even\r\nasserting that a non-aggression treaty was not\r\nnecessary. It also said that it was not interested in such\r\na treaty. We have already made it clear that we would\r\nabandon our nuclear programme if the United States\r\nclearly indicated its intention to peacefully coexist with\r\nthe Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea by\r\nconcluding a non-aggression treaty and proved, in\r\npractice, that it had changed its hostile policy towards\r\nthe Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea remains consistent in its position\r\nwith regard to the resolution of the nuclear issue\r\npeacefully, through dialogue and negotiation.\r\nAs Members are well aware, through the 15 June\r\nNorth-South Joint Declaration, North and South Korea\r\npledged themselves to promoting national\r\nreconciliation and the process of reunification by the\r\nKorean people themselves. I wish to base myself on\r\nthat joint statement in appealing to the South Korean\r\nauthorities to cooperate with the Democratic Peoples\r\nRepublic of Korea, their fellow countrymen, and to\r\nrefrain from following the foreign force. If South\r\nKorea sincerely wants a peaceful resolution of the\r\nnuclear issue, as well as national reconciliation and\r\nreunification, it would be well advised to urge the\r\nUnited States to give up its hostile policy towards the\r\nDemocratic Peoples Republic of Korea and to respond\r\npositively to the proposal set out by our side aimed at a\r\npeaceful resolution of the nuclear issue.\r\nMr. Shringla (India): Each year in this forum\r\nPakistan exposes the limitations of its ability to\r\nconduct itself in a responsible and forward-looking\r\nmanner. We regard the General Assembly as a forum\r\nfor offering views, not for resorting to abuse. Pakistan\r\ncontinues to be the epicentre of terrorism, despite its\r\nprotestations, which come easily to a country whose\r\nforeign policy has relied traditionally on camouflage\r\nand double-speak. The international community is\r\nbeginning to discover and acknowledge this, given the\r\nresurgence of Taliban activity in Afghanistan. Pakistan\r\nhas been making desperate efforts to create political\r\nfiction about its anti-terrorist credentials. That is not\r\nsurprising for a country whose history and policies\r\nhave been rooted in political fiction. In our experience,\r\nPakistans combat against international terrorism is\r\nbased upon 1 per cent intention and 99 per cent\r\npretension. That ratio needs to be reversed if Pakistan\r\nexpects us to take its commitment to end cross-border\r\nterrorism against India seriously.\r\nWe would like to remind Pakistan that it cannot\r\nhope to pursue the goal of enlightened moderation\r\nwithout demonstrating some sign of moderate\r\nenlightenment while dealing with serious issues of\r\npeace and stability. As we do not wish to reciprocate\r\nPakistans diplomacy of abuse and hate, we will not\r\ntake further issue with the egregious comments of the\r\nrepresentative of Pakistan.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give the\r\nfloor to the representative of Pakistan for five minutes.\r\nMr. Khalid (Pakistan): The Permanent\r\nRepresentative of Pakistan, in his first intervention in\r\n45\r\nA/58/PV.12\r\nexercise of the right of reply, has already dilated on\r\nPakistans position. I would merely like to add a few\r\nmore points which are pertinent to this discussion.\r\nOver the past several years, India has been\r\npursuing a sophisticated strategy of portraying itself as\r\na victim of foreign-sponsored terrorism. However,\r\nthese claims have never been substantiated. India has\r\nrefused to heed calls for an impartial judicial inquiry\r\ninto these incidents, and the inquiries that have been\r\nheld indicate that the terrorist incidents are part of a\r\nwell-considered and systematic plan crafted by the\r\nIndian intelligence agencies.\r\nI would like to refer to an independent inquiry\r\ncarried out by two Indian non-governmental organizations\r\n the Punjab Human Rights Organization and the\r\nMovement Against State Repression  which\r\nconcluded, in March 2000, that the Chattisinghpora\r\nmassacre was conducted by renegade elements in the\r\npay of Indian agencies.\r\nThe 1999 Human Rights Watch report, Behind\r\nthe Kashmir Conflict, states that since at least early\r\n1995, Indian security forces have armed and trained\r\nlocal auxiliary forces made up of surrendered or\r\ncaptured militants to assist in counter-insurgency\r\noperations. These groups participate in joint patrols,\r\nreceive and carry out orders given by security forces\r\nand operate in full view of army and security force\r\nbunkers and camps. Many of these groups have been\r\nresponsible for grave human rights abuses, including\r\nsummary executions, disappearances, torture and\r\nillegal detention. Amnesty International, in its 1999\r\nreport, said:\r\nRenegades, while usually acting in\r\nconjunction with any of these agencies, are also\r\nreported to have actively taken people into their\r\ncustody and disappeared them.\r\nDuring the past three years, Indian-sponsored\r\nagents and the Indian intelligence agency, RAW, have\r\nperpetrated 170 incidents of terrorism in Pakistan,\r\nwhich resulted in the deaths of 176 persons and in\r\ninjuries to 554. Since the year 2000, 279 Indian agents\r\nhave been apprehended in Pakistan, and so far 57\r\ntraining camps  reception centres  in India have\r\nbeen confirmed and identified by apprehended\r\nterrorists, mostly in Indian-occupied Kashmir, Rajastan\r\nand Gujarat.\r\nState terrorism is the worst form of terrorism. I\r\nhope that the spirit in which the President of Pakistan\r\nmade an offer of dialogue and reconciliation to India\r\nwill be reciprocated and taken in the spirit of\r\nearnestness in which it was made.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.55 p.m.\r\n"
