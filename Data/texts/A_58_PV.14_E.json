Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the\r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe President: The Assembly will first hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Robert Mugabe, President\r\nof the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to invite him to\r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Let me congratulate you, Sir,\r\non your election to the presidency of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am confident that\r\nyour leadership as well as your vast political and\r\ndiplomatic experience will successfully carry us\r\nthrough this session. We extend to your predecessor, Mr.\r\nJan Kavan, our sincere appreciation for the excellent\r\nmanner in which he guided the work of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session, which just ended.\r\nOur meeting today is overshadowed by the death\r\nof Special Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello and\r\nof 22 other United Nations workers, who were killed in\r\nthe line of duty in Baghdad on 19 August 2003.\r\nI join my colleagues in extending my personal\r\ncondolences and those of my Government and of the\r\npeople of Zimbabwe to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\r\nand the bereaved families. Against this tragedy and the\r\ninauspicious developments in Iraq, we cannot allow\r\nourselves to treat this session as merely routine. At the\r\nheart of the tragedy in that nation is the unprecedented\r\nassault on the ethic and function of multilateralism in\r\nworld affairs represented by the Security Council, the\r\nonly guarantor of global peace, order and security.\r\nSome powerful Western nations, led by the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America and the\r\nGovernment of Britain, went into a war of unclear\r\nobjectives in the face of clear opposition from the rest\r\nof the world, and, as we now know, with clear\r\nopposition from their own people as well.\r\nIt was and remains an unjust, illegitimate war —\r\nunjust to the extent that it was founded and prosecuted\r\non false words; illegitimate to the extent that it was not\r\nsanctioned by the United Nations and has transformed\r\nitself into an effective occupation of a sovereign\r\npeople.\r\nThere can never be world peace under conditions\r\nof foreign invasion and occupation. There can never be\r\nworld security and order when naked power suspends,\r\nand substitutes with unilateralism, the hallowed\r\nprinciple of multilateralism, on the basis of which we\r\nhave made, kept, preserved and expanded peace since\r\nthe Second World War. We tell the General Assembly\r\nthat as a people from a continent that has suffered a\r\nsimilar fate in recent history; indeed, as a people who\r\nhad to overthrow foreign imperial occupation through\r\ncostly struggles.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nIt is a strange logic that the Iraqis pay for a bad\r\npresident, a bad government and a bad war by\r\noccupation and loss of their sovereignty. Let us state\r\nhere quite clearly to both Britain and the United States\r\nthat the Iraqi people must have the sovereign right to\r\ndetermine the affairs of their country restored\r\nimmediately. Like all peoples of the world, their love\r\nfor freedom and self-rule is just as strong and just as\r\ndeep as their hatred for bad leadership and bad\r\ngovernment. Like all peoples of the world, they are\r\nunwilling to be occupied and governed by a foreign\r\ncoalition, however willing and powerful it may be. No\r\npeople want that, and we of Africa know it.\r\nWe must reject the present road map of naked\r\nunilateralism for consent-oriented statecraft in world\r\naffairs. What is the future of the world without the\r\nUnited Nations? We hope the coalition that willingly\r\nwent to war with Iraq without Security Council\r\nsanction is now willing to admit that defeating others is\r\nnot always the same as winning peace and that wars are\r\nended not by proclamations, but by just settlements.\r\nIndeed, we hope that they have learned from their\r\ncostly mistakes and are willing to let the United\r\nNations reassert its authority in the broader search for\r\npeace and security in Iraq.\r\nIf we are to overcome crises that could result in\r\ncalamitous wars and social breakdowns, and to achieve\r\npeace and stability with justice, we need humane global\r\ngovernance under the leadership of the United Nations,\r\nas distinct from a unilateral global state and\r\ngovernment. Only that type of governance can make\r\nand build peace, and indeed keep peace for mankind.\r\nLet it not be said that Zimbabwe enjoys\r\ncriticizing the United States and Britain for the sake of\r\ncriticism. Our criticisms are founded on sound,\r\nfundamental principles. Let it not be forgotten that\r\nZimbabwe was in the chair when the Security Council\r\nauthorized the first Gulf War. We stood firmly then by\r\nthe United Nations and the countries, including the\r\nUnited States and Britain, that removed Iraq from\r\nKuwait. We did so on the basis that expansionism and\r\noccupation of a sovereign country and people cannot be\r\nright, can never be just and warranted under any\r\ncircumstances. We admired the deployment of power to\r\njust ends, under the auspices of the United Nations. It\r\nis the absence of the same ingredients that explains our\r\nindignation and our sharp censure of the so-called\r\ncoalition of the willing that does not seem to recognize\r\nthat both the Iraqis and the world are unwilling to\r\nsanction the means employed and the end achieved.\r\nThe inadequacies of existing international\r\ninstitutions in dealing with present challenges is a sad\r\ntestimony to their flawed foundational conceptions\r\namidst changing circumstances. We have anachronistic\r\ninstitutions relying too comfortably on traditional\r\nnorms to address new challenges. Decades after the\r\ndefeat of Nazi Germany, does the world still need to\r\nrely on a system founded on the principle of rewarding\r\nthe allied Powers for defeating Nazi Germany and\r\nthereby bringing post-world war peace?\r\nAt its foundation, the United Nations collective\r\nsystem allowed two classes of response. If a minor\r\nPower committed aggression and there was unanimity\r\namong the five permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil, a collective response could follow. However,\r\nif a permanent member was opposed to such action it\r\ncould use its veto. In historical terms, that approach\r\nrepresents the institutionalization of a particular form\r\nof world order, namely, the immediate post-1945 world\r\norder, which sought to reward and empower the allied\r\nPowers as the only competent stewards of world peace.\r\nBut the world has changed a great deal since then. Just\r\nas many new nations have emerged since then, the\r\nallied Powers have also evolved in ways that easily\r\nmake them actors of injustice, and therefore threats to\r\nworld peace. Global power is now unipolar.\r\nThe reality today is that we cannot treat the\r\nUnited Nations system as given. The institutional\r\narrangements in place were relevant only for a\r\nspecified period, and must inevitably be adapted,\r\ntransformed or even radically modified as material\r\ncircumstances have changed and prevailing meanings,\r\npractices and purposes have been challenged by new\r\ninter-subjective voices. In today’s unipolar world, what\r\ncan the Security Council do to one of its permanent\r\nmembers whose actions threaten world peace?\r\nAt a time when citizens everywhere are pressing\r\nfor a greater say in national governance, it is\r\nimperative for us as heads of State and Government to\r\nseek, in turn, a fairer representation through the\r\ndemocratization of multilateral organizations such as\r\nthe United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and\r\nthe World Trade Organization. What is good for the\r\ngoose must surely be good for the gander. The present\r\nautocracy in global governance must be challenged\r\nstoutly so that all nations, big or small, have an equal\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nsay and equal power in the way in which we govern\r\nworld affairs.\r\nThe Security Council just has to democratize, and\r\nthat means re-examining its composition and the way\r\nin which power is distributed, and therefore exercised,\r\nwithin that crucial body. I am happy that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s current report entitled “Implementation of\r\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration”, is in\r\nagreement with our concerns that\r\n“The composition of the Security Council —\r\nunchanged in its essentials since 1945 — seems\r\nat odds with the geopolitical realities of the\r\ntwenty-first century.” [A/58/323, para. 96]\r\nIn the light of that stark reality, it is evident that the\r\ndecisions of the Security Council, which have a decisive\r\nimpact on events in the real world, increasingly lack\r\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the developing world.\r\nEven the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and\r\nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and\r\nDevelopment, popularly known as the World Bank,\r\nwhose raison d’être was to provide assistance to the\r\ndeveloping world, have succumbed to the whims and\r\ncaprices of the major Powers. The Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, in their current form and practice, are\r\ndesigned to deny developing countries the capacity to\r\nchart their independent developmental path. The\r\nextraneous conditionalities of the Bretton Woods\r\ninstitutions, imposed by the powerful countries for the\r\nqualification or disqualification of beneficiaries, are\r\nintended to further the national interests of the big\r\nPowers and to justify wanton interference in the affairs\r\nof small nations.\r\nIs it not a baffling irony that a small country like\r\nZimbabwe, which, after it responded positively to a\r\ndistress call by a neighbour suffering aggression —\r\neven by United Nations reckoning — was deemed\r\nineligible to access IMF and World Bank funding for\r\nthe very reason of having gone to the rescue of that\r\nneighbour? One hopes that the new, recent realization\r\nby the World Bank that land reforms are at the heart of\r\npoverty eradication mark the beginning of a new\r\noutlook on its part.\r\nNotwithstanding that determined and resolute\r\nattempt at frustrating our land-reform programme, the\r\nfast-track phase through which we reasserted our\r\nsovereign right over our land as a principal resource is\r\nlargely concluded, and is now yielding tangible\r\nbenefits to the vast majority of our people. There is a\r\nnew sense of empowerment, yielding a happy sense of\r\nownership, which has brought thousands upon thousands\r\nof hitherto marginalized families back into the economic\r\nmainstream. Zimbabwe’s National Economic Revival\r\nProgramme gives clear priority to agriculture as the\r\nengine for economic revival and growth. We are\r\nforging ahead on the basis of our own efforts and\r\nsupport from nations of good will. We are determined to\r\nmove on and succeed. A land review committee recently\r\nset up by my Government to assess the whole reform\r\nprogramme has now submitted its findings, which will\r\nhelp us in mapping the way forward to achieve\r\nsustainable development in the agricultural sector, in\r\nline with the criteria and objectives we set ourselves.\r\nIn the area of world trade, Zimbabwe believes in\r\na multilateral trading system that serves well all\r\nmembers of the trading nations. It is therefore a matter\r\nof some grave regret that the developing countries of\r\nthe South and those of the developed North could not\r\nreconcile their differences, and thus rendered\r\ninconclusive the Cancún mid-term review of the World\r\nTrade Organization’s (WTO) Doha Development\r\nAgenda. We in the South were right to reject the\r\nso-called new issues that the North insisted be\r\nnegotiated first. We urge the North to engage in honest\r\nnegotiations and to desist from trying to use the WTO\r\nforum for hegemonic ends.\r\nZimbabwe and other countries in the subregion\r\ncontinue to grapple with the effects of the HIV/AIDS\r\nscourge. To combat the epidemic, my Government has\r\ndeclared HIV/AIDS a national emergency. We have\r\nembarked on a national programme of prevention, the\r\nhighlight of which consists of mass mobilization to\r\ndeepen awareness and understanding of the disease. As\r\na result of that campaign, our infection rate in the\r\nsexually active 15 to 49 age group has come down\r\nfrom 35 per cent to 24 per cent. Through our national\r\nefforts, the AIDS levy has to date raised $8 billion.\r\nThat money is being distributed through a\r\ndecentralized structure that ensures accessibility right\r\ndown to the village level. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to complement our efforts.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains grave\r\nand troubled. A conflict that is quite costly on both\r\nsides of the divide continues unabated, with the only\r\nresponse from the international community coming by\r\nway of episodic judgements that maldistribute blame\r\non the basis of individual national interests. Especially\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nwrong is the belief that settlement can come only through\r\nostracizing and even eliminating the leadership of the\r\nPalestinian people. Assassinations and extrajudicial\r\nkillings must be rejected as a formula for peace.\r\nZimbabwe welcomes the measures adopted by the\r\nSecurity Council aimed at strengthening the peace process\r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are\r\nencouraged by the increase, under a Chapter VII mandate,\r\nof the force levels of the United Nations Organization\r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as\r\nwell as by the imposition of a 12-month arms embargo\r\nover areas in the troubled eastern part of the Congo.\r\nWe also urge the international community to rally\r\nbehind the peace initiative of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States aimed at bringing peace to Liberia.\r\nThe transition to peace in Liberia has confirmed that, with\r\ninternational goodwill and support, African solutions to\r\nAfrican problems are possible. To strengthen the peace\r\nprocess, we call upon the international community to\r\naddress the humanitarian crisis facing the Liberian\r\npeople as a result of a debilitating civil war.\r\nMy country remains committed to playing a\r\npositive role in peacekeeping efforts carried out under\r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. Indeed, we have so\r\nfar played our part fully and magnificently.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of\r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency Mr.\r\nAbdullah Gül, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Turkey.\r\nMr. Gül (Turkey): I should like to start by\r\nextending our warmest congratulations to you, Mr.\r\nPresident, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session, as well as our full\r\nsupport. I also wish to pay tribute to Mr. Jan Kavan,\r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\nseventh session.\r\nThe memory of the many innocent people who\r\nlost their lives during the horrors of 11 September, and\r\nthat of many other victims of terror all over the world,\r\nincluding in my country, are still very fresh in our\r\nminds today. We also mourn the painful loss of our\r\nUnited Nations colleagues. They were working in the\r\nservice of the international community to secure peace\r\nand to uphold human dignity in Baghdad. The loss of\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello was particularly tragic for us, as\r\nhis visit to Ankara two weeks before his tragic death\r\nunfortunately turned out to be his last. Terrorism is a\r\ncrime against humanity. We are duty-bound to\r\neradicate that evil from the face of the Earth, and soon.\r\nWe must also not forget that there are other major\r\nchallenges that remain to be addressed, namely,\r\npoverty, illiteracy, organized crime, the problem of\r\nnarcotics, ecological disasters, epidemics such as\r\nAIDS, the issue of refugees, the illegal trade in human\r\nbeings, gender inequality, corruption, racism and\r\nxenophobia, among others.\r\nIn the new global security environment, there is a\r\nclear and pressing need to strengthen international\r\norganizations and institutions. The United Nations is at\r\nthe top of that list. The many challenges facing the\r\nworld today underline the central role of the United\r\nNations, as has been highlighted so eloquently by the\r\nSecretary-General. The efforts to adapt this unique\r\nOrganization to the realities of today’s international life\r\nshould be resolutely pursued. The world needs a more\r\nrepresentative, effective and efficient United Nations.\r\nIn close cooperation with the United Nations,\r\nTurkey has accumulated vast experience over the years\r\nin the areas of regional cooperation, peacekeeping and\r\nconflict prevention. We have also shown a strong will\r\nto solve our bilateral foreign policy problems. Today\r\nwe have very good relations with some neighbouring\r\ncountries with which we experienced difficulties in the\r\nrecent past. We are also doing our best to contribute to\r\nthe solution of problems in the Middle East, the\r\nBalkans and the Caucasus.\r\nIn order to promote harmony among civilizations,\r\nwe convened a meeting last year in Istanbul between\r\nthe European Union and the countries of the\r\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). Next\r\nyear, both the NATO summit and the OIC’s ministerial\r\nmeeting will be held in that city.\r\nMy Government’s reforms at home reflect a\r\nsustained effort to promote democracy, human rights,\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nthe rule of law, civil society, good governance,\r\naccountability and gender equality to the highest\r\nstandards set by the United Nations and the European\r\nUnion. The results show that national and spiritual\r\nvalues can be in perfect harmony with contemporary\r\nliving standards. Integration with the world is not\r\npossible without bringing our values and traditions into\r\nharmony with modernity.\r\nIt is on the strength of that increasingly relevant\r\nTurkish experience and on the strength of the richness\r\nof our ties with the international community that\r\nTurkey has decided to present its candidature for a seat\r\nin the Security Council for the years 2009-2010.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East will remain of\r\ncrucial significance for the evolution of the\r\ninternational environment for some time to come. We\r\ndo not believe that the Middle East is condemned to\r\neternal strife and suffering. This is one cradle of\r\ncivilization that had enjoyed peace and prosperity for\r\ncenturies. That is why we believe that it is feasible\r\ntoday to transform the Middle East into a region of\r\nsecurity, cooperation and prosperity. There is an urgent\r\nneed today for a fresh start in the region. The situation\r\nin Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict are at the core of\r\nefforts to bring stability to the region.\r\nThe events of this year have brought Iraq to the\r\nbeginning of a new era. All of us need to help the Iraqi\r\nnation in its formidable task of building a united, free,\r\ndemocratic and prosperous future. It is therefore highly\r\nimportant for the Security Council to agree on a\r\nmandate responsive to the needs of stabilization and\r\nreconstruction. Iraq is our close neighbour. That\r\ncountry’s future and the future of the region’s stability\r\nare inter-linked.\r\nIn the Middle East we are again witnessing a\r\ncycle of terror and violence that is taking hostage all\r\nefforts towards peace. We view the restoration of the\r\nchannels of communication and dialogue between\r\nPalestinians and Israelis as the most urgent task at\r\nhand. We believe that sending the elected President of\r\nthe Palestinian National Authority into exile cannot\r\nserve any good purpose. We call upon the Israeli\r\nGovernment to review its position. At the same time,\r\nwe urge the Palestinian side to make every effort to\r\nprevent further terrorist attacks. Turkey has close ties\r\nwith both Israelis and Palestinians. We remain ready to\r\ncontribute to the implementation of the road map, to\r\nwhich we believe there is no alternative. We are also\r\nwilling to contribute to the improvement of the security\r\nenvironment as needed, and to the alleviation of the\r\nharsh living conditions of Palestinians.\r\nIn order to achieve progress, resources have to be\r\nutilized rationally and to the benefit of the people, as\r\nthe Iraqi case has shown. The need for reform is not a\r\nnovelty in the Middle East. What may be new is the\r\ngrowing recognition that progress is dependent on\r\npolitical and social factors, as well as on economic\r\nones. Gradual steps towards more representative and\r\naccountable structures are being taken by a number of\r\ncountries in the Middle East. They deserve the\r\nencouragement of the international community.\r\nThe world needs the elimination of weapons of\r\nmass destruction. It does not need them to proliferate.\r\nThe inherent logic of that argument has been\r\nrecognized by the community of nations that have\r\nadhered to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons. We strongly support the efforts\r\naimed at increasing membership in non-proliferation\r\nagreements and regimes.\r\nMy country’s regional policies are shaped by our\r\ndesire to achieve durable peace and greater cooperation\r\nin our neighbourhood. I have already outlined our\r\napproach with regard to the Middle East.\r\nThe Balkans, which is to our west, was in turmoil\r\nuntil recently. That region has come to enjoy relative\r\npeace and stability in the past two years. International\r\norganizations, notably NATO, the European Union, the\r\nUnited Nations and the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe, played a major role in that\r\nturnaround. However, the situation in certain parts of the\r\nregion should continue to be monitored on an ongoing\r\nbasis, as it is a potential source of destabilization.\r\nWe are determined to further enhance our\r\nrelations with Greece within the current process of\r\nconstructive dialogue. We are pleased with the progress\r\nachieved so far, as highlighted by my Greek colleague,\r\nMr. Papandreou, in the statement he made this\r\nmorning. We have already covered considerable\r\nground. We are convinced that the ongoing dialogue\r\nand the resulting atmosphere of mutual confidence will\r\nserve the interests of both Turkey and Greece.\r\nTurkey sincerely desires a lasting political\r\nsettlement establishing a new partnership in Cyprus.\r\nThis issue has been with us since 1963. Attempts to\r\ndistort the facts in the island will not help efforts aimed\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nat a comprehensive settlement. We continue to support\r\nthe good offices mission of the Secretary-General. A\r\nnew partnership in Cyprus should be based on a\r\ncompromise between Turkish and Greek Cypriots and\r\non equal status. Furthermore, a settlement should\r\npreserve the bizonal character of the island and ensure\r\nthe security of the Turkish Cypriot people.\r\nAt the present stage of the situation in Cyprus it\r\nis necessary to create a basis for substantive\r\nnegotiations. The opportunity created by President\r\nDenktas’ latest proposals, which are designed to\r\novercome the lack of confidence between the two\r\nsides, should be seized. Indeed, the Greek Cypriot side,\r\ninstead of trying to take advantage of the prospect of\r\nits unilateral accession to the European Union, should\r\nact in a spirit of goodwill and contribute to the\r\nnegotiating process. All embargoes and restrictions\r\nimposed upon the Turkish Republic of Northern\r\nCyprus should be lifted as a matter of priority.\r\nThe Caucasus is another strategically important\r\narea of great interest to Turkey. The long-standing\r\nconflicts there must end, and good-neighbourly\r\nrelations and regional cooperation should be given a\r\nreal chance to flourish. The problems of Nagorny\r\nKarabakh and Abkhazia still endanger peace and\r\nstability in the entire region. Turkey expects Armenia\r\nto fully comply with the relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions in order to find a prompt and just solution\r\nto the Nagorny Karabakh conflict. The peaceful\r\nsettlement of this conflict will contribute to the\r\nnormalization of Turkish-Armenian relations and to\r\nregional cooperation. As regards the Abkhazian\r\nconflict, Turkey believes that a peaceful settlement\r\nshould be reached within the context of the territorial\r\nintegrity, sovereignty and political unity of Georgia.\r\nClose historical and cultural bonds with Central\r\nAsia constitute one of the pillars of our Eurasian vision.\r\nWe have developed mutually beneficial bilateral relations\r\nwith the Central Asian States since their independence.\r\nWe should make substantial efforts to improve regional\r\nstability and security and continue to support those\r\nStates with a view to their further integration into the\r\ninternational community. We all know that the security\r\nof Central Asia is inseparable from global security.\r\nTraditionally a close friend of Afghanistan, Turkey\r\nhas contributed for many years to the rehabilitation of that\r\ncountry. We are pleased that the Bonn process has so far\r\nbeen implemented successfully, despite numerous\r\ndifficulties. We commend the performance of the\r\nTransitional Administration in this respect. The success\r\nof the Bonn process will depend to a large extent on\r\ngreater support from the international community.\r\nWe firmly believe that it will not be possible to\r\nestablish global stability unless peace, security,\r\ndemocracy and sustainable development are promoted\r\nin Africa. Recent trends in the management of crises in\r\nAfrica, as well as the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment, give us fresh hope in this regard.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress that Turkey\r\nis determined to remain a major contributor to peace,\r\nsecurity and stability in our region and beyond. Turkey\r\npursues a multidimensional foreign policy that is active\r\nin various regions. We believe in the vital role of the\r\nUnited Nations and its increased relevance in the present\r\ninternational environment, and we are committed to\r\npromoting the effectiveness of our Organization.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Phil Goff, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of New Zealand.\r\nMr. Goff (New Zealand): The General Assembly\r\nis meeting in the shadow of the tragedy last month in\r\nwhich United Nations staff were killed or injured in\r\nBaghdad. New Zealand unreservedly condemns such\r\nbrutal and calculated acts of terror. The United Nations,\r\nafter all, was in Iraq to improve the conditions of Iraqi\r\npeople and to assist the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.\r\nWe mourn the loss of all those who perished. In\r\nparticular, I pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello, who\r\nworked so effectively in the world’s trouble spots,\r\nincluding Timor-Leste, where New Zealand worked\r\nalongside him and developed huge admiration for his\r\nability and determination.\r\nThis was not the first occasion on which the\r\nemployees of the international community have been\r\ntargeted, although it was the worst. History suggests\r\nthat it will not be the last.\r\nTo do its work effectively, the United Nations\r\nmust interact with local communities, not operate from\r\nbehind barbed wire and concrete barriers. Its\r\nemployees are mainly unarmed civilians. We, the States\r\nMembers of the United Nations, must do more to\r\nprotect those whom we employ to work on our behalf.\r\nNine years ago New Zealand was at the forefront\r\nin creating the Convention for the Safety of United\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nNations and Associated Personnel. It was opened for\r\nsignature in 1995. Regrettably, only one third of the\r\nmembership has since become a party to it. We urge all\r\ncountries to do so now.\r\nNew Zealand believes that the Convention should\r\nbe widened to cover all situations where United\r\nNations and other associated personnel are engaged in\r\npeacekeeping, humanitarian and other assistance-\r\nrelated activities.\r\nOver the last year we have witnessed terrorist\r\nattacks, including in Casablanca, Riyadh and Jakarta,\r\nas well as in Baghdad.\r\nNext month is the first anniversary of the terrorist\r\nattack in Bali, in which more than 200 people lost their\r\nlives. And two years ago this city itself was the victim\r\nof the 9/11 attacks, which took 3,000 lives.\r\nInternational terrorism remains the primary threat to\r\nthe security and well-being of people across the world.\r\nIf we are to defeat terrorism, regional cooperation\r\nis imperative. In the Asia Pacific region, a concerted\r\nresponse to terrorism is now at the centre of the\r\nAssociation of South-east Asian Nations Regional\r\nForum agenda and is becoming increasingly important\r\nin the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\r\nThe Pacific Islands Forum is responding\r\ncollectively to security challenges, including terrorism,\r\ntransnational crimes and challenges to national\r\nintegrity and independence.\r\nAn effective campaign against terrorism requires\r\ninternational collaboration on intelligence, military,\r\nsocial and economic measures.\r\nNew Zealand is aware that while we focus on the\r\nsymptoms of terrorism, the international community\r\nmust work together to tackle the conditions that foster\r\nit. We welcome the Norwegian initiative to strengthen\r\nanalysis of the causes of terrorism. There are simply no\r\nends that can justify the death and the maiming of\r\nvulnerable and innocent people.\r\nNew Zealand has, since 1972, supported the\r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive international regime to\r\noutlaw terrorism. I hope that the General Assembly will\r\nbe able to move forward on this issue and conclude the\r\ncomprehensive and nuclear terrorism conventions.\r\nIn combating terrorism, however, we should\r\navoid undermining the very values we are seeking to\r\nuphold. The fight against terrorism should not become\r\nan excuse to justify actions that do not conform to\r\ninternational standards of humanity.\r\nNew Zealand is the current Chair of the Pacific\r\nIslands Forum, which it hosted last month. Leaders\r\nstrongly endorsed the Regional Assistance Mission to\r\nthe Solomon Islands — a concrete example of the\r\nregion working together to assist one of its members to\r\nrestore security, stability and progress to its people.\r\nNew Zealand joined with the other members of\r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum in responding to a request\r\nfrom the Solomon Islands Government for police and\r\nmilitary assistance to end the actions of armed\r\ncriminals responsible for the deterioration in the social\r\nand economic conditions in the Solomon Islands. A\r\npolice-led operation has been working successfully to\r\nrestore the rule of law and economic stability.\r\nIn failed or weak States, Governments often lack the\r\ncapacity or will to exercise territorial control. That can\r\ncreate a power vacuum for terrorist organizations and\r\ncriminals to exploit and maintain safe havens, training\r\nfacilities and bases for launching terrorist operations.\r\nThe Regional Assistance Mission has gone\r\nexceptionally well to date and has received strong\r\nsupport from the people of the Solomon Islands. It is a\r\nPacific solution to a Pacific problem. Cooperation and\r\ncommitment by Pacific States to respond to regional\r\nsecurity needs, under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands\r\nForum, is a model that other regions could adopt.\r\nThe statements of support from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Security Council for this regional\r\naction, taken in accordance with the Charter, are\r\nwelcome. We would urge the United Nations to assist\r\nwhere it can the process of rebuilding the social\r\nstructure and the economy of that country.\r\nNew Zealand is working to enhance and\r\ncomplement existing security capabilities within the\r\nPacific region. We are engaged in a number of\r\nactivities, including establishing border security\r\nsystems and drafting model legislation to address\r\nterrorism and transnational organized crime.\r\nThe international community must retain an\r\nongoing commitment to Afghanistan, where President\r\nKarzai’s Government continues to face significant\r\nchallenges. Improving security outside Kabul will be a\r\ncrucial element in bringing political stability to\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nIt is in the interests of us all to assist in the\r\nrestoration of Afghanistan — not only for the well-\r\nbeing of the Afghan people, but also so that terrorists\r\ncannot operate freely within its borders.\r\nEarlier this week, New Zealand assumed\r\nleadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in\r\nBamian Province. I am pleased that we could\r\ndemonstrate support for the Afghanistan Transitional\r\nGovernment in this way.\r\nThe shared nightmare of all States is that\r\nweapons of mass destruction or the materials from\r\nwhich they can be constructed will find their way into\r\nthe terrorist arsenal. The possibility of nuclear weapons\r\nin the hands of terrorists is a worst-case scenario with\r\nhorrific implications. We must do everything we can to\r\nprevent this from happening.\r\nThe possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by\r\nterrorist groups increases as the numbers and types of\r\nthese weapons, and the States that possess them,\r\ncontinue to expand. For these and other reasons the\r\nelimination of these weapons is vital.\r\nNew Zealand calls on all countries to commit and\r\nto adhere to multilateral disarmament and arms control\r\ntreaties.\r\nNorth Korea’s proclaimed nuclear weapons\r\nprogramme is a major concern. We urge North Korea to\r\nresume its cooperation with the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) and its commitment to the\r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The current\r\nmultilateral dialogue process is a positive way forward.\r\nWe commend China for facilitating this.\r\nIran, too, must heed the strong message of the\r\ninternational community and take the urgent steps\r\nrequired to restore confidence that its nuclear\r\nintentions are peaceful.\r\nThe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is equally\r\nabout nuclear disarmament. The commitment given by\r\nthe nuclear-weapon States to give up their nuclear\r\nweapons, reaffirmed unequivocally at the NPT Review\r\nConference in 2000, must be honoured.\r\nThe nuclear Powers have a particular responsibility\r\nin this respect. They must lead by example against\r\nproliferation. Meaningful steps toward permanent\r\ndisarmament would add to their moral authority in\r\ndemanding that others must not develop nuclear\r\nweapons capability.\r\nThe invasion of Iraq has had a profound impact\r\non this Organization. We regret that differences of view\r\ncould not be resolved in the Security Council.\r\nThe reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of its\r\nsovereignty and the rebuilding of political and social\r\nstructures to guarantee the Iraqi people a better life are\r\nnow the critical issues. We welcome initiatives to push\r\nforward the political and constitutional process.\r\nThe passage of Security Council resolutions 1483\r\n(2003) and 1500 (2003) recognizes the vital role of the\r\nUnited Nations and the need for the international\r\ncommunity to be fully engaged in reconstruction\r\nefforts. While responsibility for security must\r\ninevitably rest with coalition forces, multilateralism\r\noffers the best prospect and the greatest legitimacy for\r\nthe process of transition back to Iraqi self-rule.\r\nNew Zealand has announced substantial\r\ncontributions to reconstruction and humanitarian relief\r\nwork. These include the deployment of a New Zealand\r\nDefence Force light engineer group to work on\r\nhumanitarian and reconstruction tasks alongside a\r\nUnited Kingdom engineer regiment in southern Iraq.\r\nWe have helped with demining operations and have\r\nmade contributions through United Nations agencies,\r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations.\r\nNew Zealand continues to view the United\r\nNations as the best hope we have to collectively pursue\r\nthe principles enshrined in the Charter. The strength of\r\nthe United Nation is that it brings all countries of the\r\nworld together on an equal footing to address common\r\nproblems. Millions of people around the world have had\r\ntheir lives improved by the actions of the United Nations.\r\nEast Timor is but one recent example of its effectiveness\r\nwhen it is supported by a common will to act.\r\nAt the same time, we all recognize the need to\r\nreform the Organization. In opening this session, the\r\nSecretary-General called on us to consider whether the\r\nrules and instruments of this multilateral institution\r\ncontinue to serve us well. We have been discussing the\r\nreform of the Security Council for more than a decade\r\nnow. It is time to make an institution designed in an\r\nearlier age, for a smaller number of nations more\r\nrepresentative and responsive to the 191 current\r\nMembers of the United Nations. We welcome the\r\nestablishment of a panel to address key issues\r\nfundamental to the Organization’s future role. Member\r\nStates will need to put aside self-interest and\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\ndifferences to reach agreement on the panel’s findings\r\nand to translate those into action.\r\nFifty-eight years ago, the United Nations was\r\ncreated in the aftermath of the death and devastation\r\nthat had resulted from two world wars. The vision of\r\nits founders was that of an organization that would\r\nestablish rules to govern international behaviour, with\r\nprocedures to enforce them through collective action. The\r\nUnited Nations was bestowed with a unique legitimacy\r\nand unique authority to resolve conflict. Whatever its\r\nshortcomings, it remains an indispensable organization.\r\nThe challenge before us is to create the structures\r\nand provide the political will that will enable it to\r\ndeliver the peaceful, just and prosperous world that is\r\nthe hope and expectation of humanity.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nSheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jabr Al-Thani, First\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the State of Qatar.\r\nSheik Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me great pleasure to extend to you, Sir, our\r\nsincere congratulations on your election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. Allow me to wish you and the members of\r\nthe Bureau every possible success. I should also like to\r\nexpress our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor,\r\nMr. Jan Kavan, President of the fifty-seventh session, for\r\nhis great efforts in conducting the work of the General\r\nAssembly. It also gives me pleasure to recognize\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who deserves our sincere\r\nthanks, respect and admiration for his tireless efforts.\r\nToday, the world is experiencing a difficult,\r\ncritical and highly complex phase in international\r\nrelations, marked by political and strategic changes\r\naffecting the elements and objectives of those relations.\r\nThis is the result of the emergence of a new,\r\ncomplicated and multifaceted set of problems and acute\r\nregional and international crises, whose root causes we\r\nmust deal with promptly and in a serious manner.\r\nMoreover, we must prevent such crises from worsening\r\nand spreading. We must therefore strive to strengthen\r\nthe role of the United Nations, enhance its institutions\r\nand provide it with the essential resources so it can\r\nfulfil its mission throughout the world.\r\nFirst, it is imperative that we mobilize the\r\npolitical will needed to enable the Organization to\r\nshoulder its responsibilities and carry out its duties.\r\nThat is particularly important for the permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council because those\r\ncountries bear the primary responsibility for achieving\r\nthat goal, which will enable the Organization to\r\nperform its functions in a genuinely democratic spirit,\r\nreflecting the new international conditions and the\r\ninterests and aspirations of all peoples of the world\r\nwithout exclusion or preference.\r\nIn that context, we underline the need to reach\r\nagreement on a new formula for the composition of the\r\nSecurity Council and to modernize its working\r\nmethods, as it is the international body charged with\r\nthe primary responsibility for maintaining international\r\npeace and security. The Council’s current composition,\r\nworking methods and decision-making process do not\r\nrespond to the needs of the international community or\r\ngive Member States an opportunity to speak on the\r\nvital and critical issues that affect us all.\r\nIn the State of Qatar, we were shocked and\r\nsaddened by the horrific attack on the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad. That attack claimed the lives\r\nof many innocent victims: the United Nations staff\r\nmembers who were carrying out their humanitarian\r\nmission, foremost among them the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, and many Iraqis. That heinous act of\r\nterrorism illustrates in our view the nature of the\r\nchallenges and the seriousness of the threats besetting\r\nthe work of the United Nations and international\r\nhumanitarian organizations in Iraq and elsewhere. We\r\nalso strongly condemn the terrorist act targeting the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Iraq earlier this week.\r\nThe difficult and tragic circumstances now\r\nprevailing in the brotherly country of Iraq compel us to\r\ncooperate in order to help the Iraqi people overcome\r\nthat situation and its consequences.\r\nI must underline once again the fundamental\r\nprinciples underlying our position with respect to the Iraqi\r\ncrisis and the means necessary to deal with it. We have\r\nconsistently affirmed our commitment to the territorial\r\nintegrity, national unity and sovereignty of Iraq and to\r\nthe right of Iraqis to self-determination, to the restoration\r\nof their independence and sovereignty and to the\r\nreconstruction of their homeland, as well as to their right\r\nto live in dignity and freedom in their own land.\r\nIn that context, we look forward to the success of\r\nthe international efforts to strengthen security and\r\nstability in Iraq. We call upon the coalition forces to\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nachieve that essential objective and to intensify\r\ncoordination with the competent international bodies\r\nand institutions in order to pave the way for the\r\ncountry’s return to normalcy. We call upon the\r\ncoalition forces to allow the Iraqi people, of all factions\r\nand political trends, to exercise their legitimate right to\r\nchoose their own political leadership through free,\r\ndemocratic elections, giving expression to their\r\naspirations, hopes and wishes.\r\nIn that regard, we also welcome the establishment\r\nof the Interim Governing Council and the interim Iraqi\r\nGovernment that emerged from it; they mark an\r\nimportant positive step, and we hope that they will\r\ncontribute to achieving the desired transition towards\r\nconsolidated democracy in the country and the\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraqi State\r\ninstitutions. That should be accomplished by drafting a\r\nnew constitution, holding free democratic elections,\r\nputting an early end to the occupation through a\r\nspecific timetable and allowing Iraq to reclaim its\r\nrightful position in the region and in the larger\r\ninternational community.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to play an effective,\r\nessential role in helping Iraq achieve those objectives.\r\nMoreover, the international community is urgently called\r\nupon to help in Iraq’s reconstruction and to meet the Iraqi\r\npeople’s needs in various areas in order to build a new\r\nIraq of democracy, equality and respect for human rights.\r\nWith regard to developing Iraq’s infrastructure of\r\nhigher education, it is noteworthy that the consort of\r\nHis Royal Highness the Emir of the State of Qatar, Her\r\nRoyal Highness Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Misnad,\r\nSpecial Envoy for Basic and Higher Education + 5 of the\r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\r\nOrganization (UNESCO), launched a lofty initiative in\r\na statement before the World Conference on Higher\r\nEducation, held in Paris at UNESCO headquarters. The\r\ninitiative called for the establishment of an\r\ninternational fund for Iraqi higher education, with the\r\nobjective of providing both immediate and long-term\r\nassistance for the rehabilitation of higher education in\r\nbrotherly Iraq. The State of Qatar has made the first\r\ncontribution to the fund, in the amount of $15 million.\r\nMy country has also been participating in\r\ninternational efforts to rebuild Iraq. It has developed a\r\nspecial programme that includes the building of\r\nhospitals and educational and residential units. In\r\naddition, we have a special programme in Afghanistan\r\nthat assists in the rebuilding of that country; the\r\nprogramme’s cost has amounted to $62 million thus far.\r\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict and the question of\r\nPalestine are at the top of the list of the conflicts that\r\nneed concerted action in order to achieve a just, final\r\nand comprehensive solution, particularly in the light of\r\nthe continuation and acceleration of the bloody\r\nconfrontation that has raged between the Palestinian\r\npeople and Israeli occupation forces for so many years.\r\nIt must be noted that we in the State of Qatar have\r\nwelcomed the road map. We expressed our support for\r\nthe Quartet’s efforts to have both sides begin\r\nimplementing the various stages of the road map, in\r\nkeeping with the vision articulated by Mr. George\r\nBush, President of the United States, as a basis for the\r\nfinal solution of establishing two States living side by\r\nside. We did so despite the many difficulties, obstacles\r\nand setbacks encountered by those efforts in the past\r\nfew weeks. We must also firmly stress that\r\nimplementation of the road map cannot be undertaken\r\nby only one side — the Palestinian people. It requires\r\nthat the Israeli side also fulfil its obligations and take\r\nthe necessary actions in that regard.\r\nAll of the aforementioned requires that the\r\ninternational community and the members of the\r\nQuartet — particularly the United States of America —\r\nintervene, intensify their efforts and increase their\r\npressure on the Israeli Government so that it will do its\r\npart, in return for the Palestinians’ commitment to do\r\ntheirs. Thus, Israeli occupation forces must refrain\r\nfrom carrying out assassinations, must lift the siege that\r\nthey have imposed on Palestinian territories, enable the\r\nPalestinians to live in security, peace and dignity on their\r\nown land and to move freely in their own areas, put an\r\nend to the policies of starvation, humiliation and house\r\ndemolition, and cease construction of the buffer wall\r\ncurrently being built by the Israeli authorities.\r\nIn that connection, I cannot fail to note the positive\r\ngesture that we witnessed a few days ago by the Libyan\r\nGovernment’s closing of the Lockerbie file, an outcome\r\nthat was achieved in cooperation with the other parties\r\nconcerned and in the context of United Nations\r\ninstitutions. We should also note the positive response\r\nof the Governments of the United States, the United\r\nKingdom and France to that gesture, which bore fruit\r\nand ultimately led to the conclusion of an agreement.\r\nThe phenomena of terrorism and extremism\r\ncontinue to be among the most important challenges\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nfacing the world. As we express our total rejection and\r\ncondemnation of those subversive phenomena — in all\r\ntheir forms and manifestations, and regardless of their\r\nsources or motivations — we reaffirm that we stand by\r\nthe side of the international community and that we\r\nsupport whatever efforts and measures are required to\r\neliminate terrorism and to strengthen the foundations\r\nof security and stability.\r\nDemocracy is an expression of responsible\r\nparticipation in political decision-making. It involves\r\nthe establishment of State institutions and adherence to\r\nthe rule of law within the State; it provides for\r\naccountability and for assessment of the performance of\r\ngovernmental institutions; it ensures good governance\r\nand safeguards the rights of citizens. As such, it is the\r\nbest way to achieve the priorities of national\r\ndevelopment and the objectives of modernization and\r\nreform, to which our peoples and societies aspire. On\r\nthe basis of those principles, the State of Qatar recently\r\nconducted a referendum on a political Constitution that\r\ngives women the right to political participation, both as\r\nvoters and as candidates for Parliament, which will be\r\nelected through the ballot box for the first time. The\r\nConstitution also governs the relationship between the\r\nGovernment and the people and provides for the\r\nseparation of the three branches of government.\r\nWith regard to human rights, an independent human\r\nrights commission has been established in the State of\r\nQatar. The commission submits its recommendations to\r\ncompetent State authorities with a view to developing\r\nand improving civil liberties. As promoting awareness\r\nof civil rights requires that we improve education and\r\nupgrade its standards — as well as expanding it to\r\ninclude all segments of society — we have restructured\r\nour educational system. Moreover, a number of well-\r\nknown universities based in developed countries have\r\nset up branches in the State of Qatar.\r\nIn conclusion, the fulfilment of our aspirations\r\nlies in affirming the role of the United Nations, in\r\nenhancing its position and in maximizing its potential.\r\nIt is through the Organization that we hope to establish\r\ninternational relations on the basis of understanding,\r\ncooperation and common interests. And it is through\r\nthe United Nations that we hope one day to succeed in\r\nsettling crises and disputes; eliminating threats of\r\nviolence, the use of force and terrorism; and ending the\r\nwasting of resources and energies on wars and\r\nconflicts, directing them instead to the service of\r\ndevelopment, progress and prosperity. Similarly, we\r\naspire to a new world built on the principles of justice,\r\nequality, liberty, democracy and peaceful coexistence\r\namong all the world’s peoples, nations and cultures.\r\nThat is an aspiration that our peoples, our youth and\r\nour future generations fully deserve. It is an aspiration\r\nto which we are wedded and which we cherish, because\r\nthat vision occupies the highest priority in building the\r\nworld of the future: the world that we all seek and\r\ndesire. It is a world that we hope one day to attain as an\r\ninternational community — as one family living\r\ntogether on this planet, God willing.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency The\r\nHonourable Billie Miller, Senior Minister and Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.\r\nMs. Miller (Barbados): I take special pleasure in\r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession. The unanimous election of the smallest State\r\never to hold that post speaks not only of the confidence\r\nwhich Member States place in your own ability, but\r\nalso of their recognition of the critical role which small\r\nStates play in the multilateral process. We are delighted\r\nat your elevation to this high office, and we wish to\r\nassure you that, in carrying out your responsibilities,\r\nyou will be able to count on the unequivocal support\r\nnot only of Saint Lucia, but also of the entire\r\nCaribbean fraternity. I wish also to thank your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, who very ably guided the\r\nwork of the fifty-seventh session of the General\r\nAssembly during a most trying and tumultuous year.\r\nOn 19 August, the world was again plunged into\r\nshock and despair as we witnessed the heinous attack\r\non the United Nations Office in Baghdad and the loss\r\nof life of United Nations personnel stationed there. A\r\nsecond attempt this week added to the toll of casualties.\r\nI extend to the United Nations family, as well as the\r\ndelegations represented here, whose compatriots were the\r\nvictims of that violent attack, the deepest condolences of\r\nthe Government and people of Barbados.\r\nWe pause especially to pay tribute to Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello, an international civil servant and\r\ndiplomat of the highest calibre. His death comes at a\r\ntime when the world can least afford it. We join with\r\nMembers in mourning his passing as we mourn all\r\nthose who perished at his side in the service of the\r\npeople of Iraq.\r\nAmidst the turmoil and carnage that has become a\r\ndismal feature of the daily life of so many millions in\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nour global society, this assault on the United Nations\r\nwas particularly startling in its cruelty and distressing\r\nin its intention. As our Secretary-General has affirmed:\r\n“This was the most deliberate and vicious attack\r\nagainst the United Nations in its history.” It is the\r\ncruellest of ironies that such an attack could have been\r\nconceived and carried out against an Organization in\r\nwhich we all have a stake, and one which epitomizes\r\nthe principles and ideals to which we all ascribe, and\r\nwhose primary purpose is peace.\r\nThe global environment, over the past year, has\r\nteetered on the brink of chaos. We have witnessed\r\nincreased instances of the pursuit of violence and\r\nretribution as first responses to the resolution of\r\nconflict, and we have experienced the relegation of\r\ndiplomacy and multilateralism to afterthoughts.\r\nSome of the most intractable problems facing the\r\ninternational community, in the year 2003 and beyond,\r\nare the divisions, uncertainties and doubts that have\r\nemerged since the United States-led invasion of Iraq.\r\nOur duty as members of this family of nations is to\r\nensure that we remain committed to the United\r\nNations, as the only organization that can move us past\r\nthe current cycle of retribution to a path of sustainable\r\npeace. As we search for adequate collective responses\r\nto the non-traditional threats to human security, the\r\ntask ahead will be to bring to bear a comprehensive,\r\nmultidimensional approach to security, in all its\r\naspects, and to reiterate the continued relevance of this\r\nconcept to the global agenda.\r\nThe challenges to small States in such an\r\nuncertain environment are numerous and at times\r\noverwhelming. We lack the financial dexterity to\r\nrespond to economic crises as swiftly and decisively as\r\nis necessary. We have no military might and so our\r\nonly avenue for handling traditional threats to security\r\nrests squarely within a multilateral framework, which\r\nresorts to military action only when, despite our best\r\nefforts, peace cannot be achieved through diplomacy.\r\nSince the end of the conflicts of European\r\nempire-building, our region, the Caribbean, has had a\r\nhistory of peace and stability, which is sustained\r\nthrough a simple but sure formula: celebration of our\r\ncommonalities; tolerance of our differences; mutual\r\nrespect for each other’s sovereignty; and adherence to\r\nthe principles of democracy, good governance and the\r\nrule of law. We would wish to commend this formula to\r\nthose who find the key to peaceful co-existence elusive.\r\nBarbados remains unwavering in its commitment\r\nto the precepts of multilateralism, and to the belief that\r\nno other international institution is better suited or\r\nequipped to meet the diverse demands for global peace,\r\nsecurity and development than the United Nations. As\r\nmembers of this Organization, we are assured that our\r\nvoice will be heard regardless of our size or economic\r\npower. Therefore, while we may not have the capacity\r\nto influence situations by way of exerting military,\r\neconomic or even political power, we do cherish our\r\nright to express our opinions about any issue of\r\nconcern to us, without let or hindrance.\r\nThe United Nations is not a third party separate\r\nfrom the Member Governments but is rather the sum of\r\nits Members; it belongs to them and they share all the\r\nbenefits, problems and collective responsibilities of\r\nownership. Barbados shares the view so eloquently\r\nexpressed by the Secretary-General that: “The United\r\nNations exists, not as a static memorial to the aspirations\r\nof an earlier age, but as a work in progress — imperfect,\r\nas all human endeavours must be, but capable of\r\nadaptation and improvement.” We are all accountable for\r\nits shortcomings and must all strive for its improvement.\r\nTo the extent that the United Nations represents\r\nour collective effort at a mechanism for global\r\ngovernance, it is amenable to the benefits of good\r\ngovernance practices. For we believe that good\r\ngovernance is as important at the international level as\r\nit is at the national level. It is perhaps the single most\r\nimportant factor in promoting development, reducing\r\ninequalities and advancing the cause of peace.\r\nWe should therefore seize this moment in time to\r\nrecommit ourselves to making the United Nations more\r\neffective and efficient. Bold and serious reorganization\r\ninitiatives, including the revitalization of the General\r\nAssembly, and the reform of the Security Council are\r\nurgently needed. We must also find effective coordination\r\nmodalities to give new impetus to the follow-up to the\r\nmajor conferences and summits of the last decade,\r\nwhich, in most instances, have simply been reduced to\r\nstanding items on the annual agenda of this body and\r\nrhetoric-filled resolutions reaffirming the status quo.\r\nWe must resolve, during this session and\r\nhenceforth, to take concrete actions towards making the\r\nSecurity Council more representative and transparent and\r\ntowards ensuring that the General Assembly moves\r\nbeyond the symbolic politics of passing resolutions to\r\nthe hard work of negotiating change.\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nFor it is a source of the greatest continuing concern\r\nto us that too many of the premier multilateral institutions\r\n— which are charged with the fundamental responsibility\r\nof shaping the rules by which global society is\r\ngoverned, whether in the area of peace and security, or\r\ntrade, or finance and development — are constrained\r\nby structure and tradition to carry out their mandate in\r\na manner that is patently devoid of democracy or\r\ntransparency. Reform must therefore extend beyond the\r\nconfines of New York to reach deep into the operations\r\nof the international financial institutions, the World\r\nTrade Organization, the Organization for Economic\r\nCooperation and Development, the Financial Action\r\nTask Force on Money-Laundering and all other bodies\r\nthat seek to prescribe the norms of behaviour for the\r\ninternational community without the full participation\r\nof that community in the decision-making process.\r\nIf the International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment had one failing, it was its inability to\r\nconceive of a new system for financial governance to\r\nredress the deficiencies and imbalances of the past — a\r\nsystem that is durable enough to serve for generations\r\nto come. In this regard, I wish to reiterate the call made\r\nat Monterrey by the Prime Minister of Barbados, The\r\nRight Honourable Owen Arthur, for the creation of a\r\nrules-based world financial authority to supervise\r\ntoday’s complex global financial and capital markets\r\nbetter than the Bretton Woods institutions can, and for\r\nan international tax organization to oversee global\r\ncooperation in cross-border tax matters.\r\nDespite a commitment made by all States at\r\nMonterrey towards the development of a universal\r\nframework to facilitate all-inclusive dialogue on\r\nmatters pertaining to international tax cooperation,\r\nsufficient progress has not been forthcoming. While we\r\nare encouraged by and supportive of recent proposals\r\nto strengthen the United Nations Ad Hoc Group of\r\nExperts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters,\r\nthese efforts are insufficient to provide for a truly\r\nuniversal, transparent and legitimate intergovernmental\r\nframework to promote cooperation among all States on\r\ntax matters.\r\nEqually, Barbados believes that the all-important\r\nfight against money-laundering must now be waged by\r\nthe international community as a whole, led by a\r\ngenuinely representative international body, drawing its\r\nmembership from all the countries of the world, within\r\nthe family of the United Nations. While we are most\r\nappreciative of the vital work that has been done in this\r\nregard by the Financial Action Task Force, that body\r\nremains what it has always been, a task force with a\r\nlimited role, and an even more limited membership of\r\nonly 31 countries.\r\nAn important step would be the adoption of an\r\ninternational convention against money-laundering,\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. Such a\r\nconvention would establish a genuine international\r\nconsensus on the issue of money-laundering within the\r\nuniversal ambit of the United Nations, where the\r\ninterests and concerns of all Member States would be\r\nfairly and equally served in a common endeavour\r\nagainst international crime. The proposed convention\r\nwould complement the work of the United Nations\r\nunder the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in\r\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, as well\r\nas the more recent Convention Against Transnational\r\nOrganized Crime.\r\nIn this connection, we believe that the greatest\r\nlesson to emerge from the experience of Cancun is the\r\nclear understanding that strategies and solutions that\r\nignore the concerns and needs of the developing world,\r\nor that fail to analyse the implications of those\r\nsolutions for the most fragile and vulnerable, are\r\ndoomed to failure. The special needs of small States\r\nthat have no capacity whatsoever to distort world trade\r\nmust be taken fully into account in fashioning the new\r\nrules of trade liberalization. To do otherwise would be\r\nto condemn the most vulnerable groups of our global\r\nfamily to the real threat of marginalization by a\r\nmultilateral system that is supposed to provide benefits\r\nfor all. It is vital that focus be restored to the Doha\r\nDevelopment Agenda and its work programme on\r\nsmall economies.\r\nNext year marks the tenth anniversary of the\r\nGlobal Conference on the Sustainable Development of\r\nSmall Island Developing States. Out of that conference\r\nemerged the Barbados Programme of Action, which\r\ntoday still remains the essential blueprint for the\r\nsustainable development aspirations of all small island\r\ndeveloping States (SIDS). As de facto custodian of the\r\nname attached to the SIDS process, Barbados accords\r\ngreat importance to the convening of an international\r\nmeeting next year in Mauritius to review the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nWe are convinced that the vulnerability and\r\nsustainable development challenges of SIDS, as\r\nexpressed in the Barbados Programme of Action, in\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nAgenda 21, the Millennium Declaration and the\r\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation are now better\r\nunderstood by the international community. According\r\nto estimates, since 1994 small island developing States\r\nthemselves have carried out approximately 70 per cent\r\nof the required actions and measures contained in the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action. The Mauritius review\r\nwill present an important opportunity for us to take\r\nstock of new and emerging challenges and identify\r\nadditional resources to advance implementation.\r\nThe World Summit on the Information Society is\r\nconceived as a high-level dialogue leading to achieving\r\na new kind of society, characterized by universal access to\r\nand use of information for the creation, accumulation and\r\ndissemination of knowledge. It implies the use of\r\ntraditional and new technologies, especially information\r\nand communication technologies, as an essential tool\r\nfor the enhancement of services and the promotion of\r\ndialogue among diverse cultures towards the attainment\r\nof a more peaceful, prosperous and just world. We\r\nsupport the principle that the new information society\r\nmust serve the best interests of all nations and peoples.\r\nIt must seek through the available technology to\r\nempower the most vulnerable sectors of society and\r\neradicate existing disparities within and among States.\r\nThe issue relating to the passage through the\r\nCaribbean Sea of ships bearing nuclear material is still\r\nunresolved. We are, from time to time, presented with\r\nstudies and analyses that seek to assure us of the safety\r\nof the ships and their cargo. Despite these assurances,\r\nwe all know that there is no guarantee that international\r\nterrorism will continue to ignore such a significant\r\ntarget or that an unthinkable accident would not occur.\r\nA major explosion on board one of these ships\r\ntraversing our region would threaten the survival of\r\nsurrounding States. The most acceptable solution to the\r\nproblem is cessation of the trans-shipment of nuclear\r\nmaterial through the Caribbean Sea, since, on this\r\nissue, any risk is too high.\r\nIn your address, Mr. President, upon the opening\r\nof the General Assembly, you called for action rather\r\nthan inaction. This moment in global affairs will\r\nrequire courage and determination as we face the\r\nenormous challenges awaiting us. We may not be\r\nexpected to complete the task, but then, neither are we\r\nat liberty to abstain from it.\r\nMr. Van den Berg (Netherlands), Vice-President,\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. De Hoop Scheffer (Netherlands): The deaths\r\nof Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues leave a\r\nterrible void. The loss of so many dedicated servants of\r\nthe United Nations at its headquarters in Baghdad fills\r\nus with shock, grief and concern. This atrocity and the\r\nother murderous attacks we have seen in the past two\r\nyears are chilling evidence that terrorists are ruthlessly\r\ntargeting the civilized world. Terrorism is a direct\r\nthreat to us all, to humanity as a whole.\r\nWeapons of mass destruction are the other direct\r\nthreat, an even worse threat if such weapons were to\r\nfall into the hands of terrorists.\r\nIn addition to these direct threats to peace and\r\nsecurity, we are faced with, in the words of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, “soft threats”: poverty and hunger,\r\nenvironmental degradation and diseases of mass\r\ndestruction like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\r\nWhat all these threats have in common is that\r\nthey do not stop at national borders. Their often lethal\r\nconsequences affect groups of countries, whole\r\ncontinents or even the entire planet. The only way to\r\ntackle them is by collective action. Enforcement and\r\nimplementation are the key.\r\nBut do we have the capacity to take such action?\r\nIs the existing multilateral system with its institutions\r\nand rules capable of responding to the hard threats and\r\nsoft threats we are facing? I doubt it. Take the growing\r\ndanger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Can we\r\nallow a few countries to reject the rules agreed to by\r\n187 other countries? Can we run the risk of countries\r\nturning into suppliers of nuclear arms to terrorist\r\norganizations? No, we cannot. And if today’s rules\r\ncannot avert States putting humanity at risk, we must\r\ntighten those rules and we must be ready to collectively\r\nenforce them.\r\nI therefore welcome President Bush’s proposal\r\nfor a binding Security Council resolution, tightening up\r\nthe non-proliferation rules. I suggest that we build on\r\nexisting export control regimes and make them\r\nuniversal and legally binding. This approach would be\r\nin line with the successful example of Security Council\r\nresolution 1373 (2001), containing binding obligations\r\nfor States to take action against terrorism. Other\r\nelements in a more forceful multilateral system are\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\ngreater attention to conflict prevention, better use of\r\nsanctions or “smart sanctions”, an upgrading of the\r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency’s inspections\r\nregime and, as suggested by President Chirac, a\r\npermanent instrument for inspections at the disposal of\r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMore robust multilateral action is also needed in\r\nour dealings with failed States. I am encouraged by the\r\nincreased willingness of the international community to\r\ntake more determined action. Liberia is a test case. The\r\nBrahimi report has shown us the right direction.\r\nPeacekeeping operations can only be effective if they\r\nare based on a strong mandate, fully implemented on\r\nthe ground and fully backed by the key players in the\r\nSecurity Council. The five permanent members bear a\r\nspecial responsibility for global peace and security\r\nNoblesse oblige.\r\nThe United Nations is now also at the centre of\r\nthe debate about Iraq. Let us put our past differences\r\non Iraq behind us. It is crucial now that the\r\ninternational community support the Iraqi people in\r\ntheir reconstruction efforts. I trust that the Security\r\nCouncil will reach agreement, as soon as possible, on\r\nwhat we all want, in other words, stabilization, security\r\nand transfer of sovereignty to a legitimate Iraqi\r\ngovernment. This will also allow the United Nations\r\nand the other multilateral institutions to make their\r\nindispensable contributions to a better future for the\r\nIraqi people.\r\nA stronger United Nations is also needed for the\r\neffective promotion and protection of human rights. I\r\nregret that we do not live up to the expectations of the\r\noppressed. The great dependence of the United Nations\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights on voluntary\r\ncontributions is a major concern. His office should\r\ninstead receive a larger allocation from the regular\r\nUnited Nations budget. The promotion and protection\r\nof human rights is United Nations core business.\r\nSpeaking of human rights, there is no doubt that\r\nterrorism itself ranks as one of the most serious threats\r\nto democracy and the enjoyment of human rights.\r\nTerrorists seek to destroy democracy, freedom and\r\ntolerance. If we sacrifice those universal values in the\r\nstruggle against terrorists, we play into their hands.\r\nIf I may speak for a moment as Chairman-in-\r\nOffice of the Organization for Security and\r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), I can assure you that\r\nour experience shows that policies aimed at promoting\r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance can\r\nreinforce each other as parts of a more comprehensive\r\nsecurity strategy. The International Criminal Court is\r\nanother example of how to ensure that international\r\nnorms are upheld in cases where national Governments\r\nfail to do so.\r\nOn the trafficking of human beings, women and\r\nchildren in particular, I share the concerns expressed by\r\nPresident Bush. He was right to draw a comparison\r\nwith slavery. For the OSCE, the threat posed by the\r\ninternational trafficking of drugs, of small arms and of\r\nwomen and children is a top priority. We have already\r\ntaken concrete action, adopting the OSCE Action Plan\r\nto combat trafficking in human beings as an instrument\r\nfor protecting our people. This Action Plan could serve\r\nas a model for worldwide action.\r\nYet another reason why we need a robust\r\nmultilateral system is that we must break the cycles of\r\npoverty and violence we witness in many parts of\r\nAfrica. This implies restoring stability and order as a\r\nprecondition for reconstruction and development. It\r\nalso requires an integrated approach. To this end my\r\nGovernment will set up a stability fund to tackle the\r\ntwin challenges of development and security. Because\r\ndevelopment and security are closely linked, the\r\nMillennium Development Goals should remain at the\r\ncentre of our policies. The Netherlands remains\r\ncommitted to allocating 0.8 per cent of our gross domestic\r\nproduct to development cooperation and I call on all\r\ncountries to implement their Monterrey commitments.\r\nBut development is not just a matter of aid, it will also\r\ndepend on liberalizing trade. I am disappointed that the\r\nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference in\r\nCancún failed to produce results.\r\nThe legitimacy of the decisions of the Security\r\nCouncil is questioned because the composition of the\r\nCouncil no longer reflects today’s geopolitical realities.\r\nHowever, expansion is not a solution in itself.\r\nEffectiveness can easily fall victim to the quest for\r\nlegitimacy. Crucial to restored legitimacy is better\r\ninteraction between the members of the Council and\r\nthe United Nations membership at large. Members of\r\nthe Council should represent relevant and broad\r\nsections of world opinion.\r\nI agree with the Secretary-General that we need\r\nto take a hard look at the existing architecture of\r\ninternational institutions. Many other organizations I\r\nknow well, such as the OSCE, the European Union\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\n(EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\r\n(NATO) (and I hope to get to know the last\r\norganization even better in the near future), are in the\r\nprocess of redefining their roles in drastically changed\r\ncircumstances. The United Nations cannot be left\r\nbehind. Interaction between the United Nations on the\r\none hand, and regional organizations such as the\r\nOSCE, the EU and NATO on the other, is growing.\r\nThere is considerable scope for intensifying that\r\ninteraction, as is indeed foreseen in the Charter.\r\nAs the Italian Presidency of the European Union\r\nillustrated in its intervention here some days ago, the\r\nUnited Nations can count on the EU in the quest for\r\nrobust multilateralism. As a member State of the EU, the\r\nNetherlands fully endorses the Presidency’s statement.\r\nThe EU’s new emphasis on countering the proliferation of\r\nweapons of mass destruction in its common foreign and\r\nsecurity policy is an example of how we want our\r\ncommon efforts to be in the vanguard.\r\nLet me now focus on the General Assembly. Take\r\nthe example of how we deal with the Israeli-Palestinian\r\nconflict. Let us connect the General Assembly to\r\nreality. Instead of dealing with 23 resolutions, should\r\nwe not try to find our strength in a more focused\r\ncentral message, supported by all, a message that calls\r\nupon both Israel and the Palestinians to put an end to\r\nthe bloodshed and violence and to immediately\r\nimplement the road map as the only viable way to long-\r\nlasting peace? The EU will continue to do all it can,\r\ntogether with its partners in the Quartet, to help\r\nPalestinians and Israelis reach that destination. I hope\r\nthat this Assembly can contribute.\r\nThe Assembly should be made more effective. I\r\nneed not repeat what you all know about overlapping\r\nor hardly relevant agenda items, repetitive debates and\r\nresolutions and the prevalence of the lowest common\r\ndenominator. As a contribution to improvement, my\r\ncountry tabled the Greentree report, the result of a\r\nseminar involving representatives from a wide circle of\r\ncountries. The Greentree report aims at restoring the\r\nGeneral Assembly to its rightful place as the centre\r\nstage for worldwide deliberations on our common\r\nproblems. We are certain that in that endeavour, we\r\nwill be able to count on the leadership and wisdom of\r\nthe President of the General Assembly.\r\nMy Government wholeheartedly supports the\r\ndecision of the Secretary-General to establish a panel\r\nof eminent persons. We look forward to his\r\nrecommendations for next year’s session of the\r\nAssembly. Meanwhile, we should not sit back and wait.\r\nIt is upon us Member States to engage now in the\r\ndebate on the pertinent reform questions the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has put to us.\r\nIn order to defuse the threats we face and to leave\r\na better world for future generations, we need to do\r\nmore than talk. We must act and we must act together.\r\nWe need clear rules and strong institutions —\r\ninstitutions that ensure that the rules of the multilateral\r\ngame are respected, strengthened and enforced. We\r\nneed a multilateral system with teeth; we need a\r\nmultilateral system that works.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Rashid Abdullah Al-Noaimi, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nMr. Al-Noaimi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of the United Arab Emirates, I have\r\nthe honour to extend to Mr. Hunte and to his friendly\r\ncountry, Saint Lucia, our sincerest congratulations on\r\nhis election to the presidency of the General assembly\r\nat its fifty-eighth session.\r\nI should also like to thank his predecessor, Mr.\r\nJan Kavan, for his valuable efforts and effective\r\nleadership of the previous session.\r\nOn this occasion, I would also like to express our\r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\r\nwise leadership and perseverance in his efforts to\r\nenhance the role of the United Nations in maintaining\r\npeace, security and sustainable development.\r\nDespite our hopes and the great humanitarian\r\nexpectations that we entertained with the dawn of the\r\nnew millennium, there remain many regional and\r\ninternational issues that have not been resolved and are\r\na major concern to us all. They represent a serious\r\nthreat to international peace and security, as well as to\r\nthe stability, development and prosperity of peoples, all\r\nof which depend on respect for and implementation of\r\nthe norms of international laws, and conventions.\r\nThe regrettable events that our world is\r\nwitnessing today are but the natural aftermath of the\r\nprevious political era, which was characterized by\r\nconflicts, occupation, oppression, injustice, the violation\r\nof human rights and wars that led to a wide range of\r\narm races at the expense of human, economic and\r\nenvironmental development. If we are to confront and\r\ncontain these challenges and their repercussions, it is\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nimportant to reform the United Nations and all its main\r\nbodies — especially the Security Council, the General\r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council — as\r\nwell as to enhance cooperation and coordination\r\nbetween these international organizations and regional\r\norganizations.\r\nMaintaining stability and security in the Arab\r\nGulf area is an essential priority, not only for the peoples\r\nof the region, but also for the entire world. Accordingly,\r\nwithin the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council\r\nand of bilateral, regional and international relations, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates has adopted a foreign policy\r\nbased on peaceful coexistence, confidence-building,\r\ngood-neighbourliness, mutual respect, non-interference in\r\nthe internal affairs of others, the settlement of disputes\r\nand the ending of occupation by peaceful means.\r\nOn the basis of its commitment to these doctrines\r\nand the principles of the Charter of the United Nations,\r\nthe United Arab Emirates believes that the way to end the\r\noccupation of its three islands — Greater Tumb, Lesser\r\nTumb and Abu Moussa — by the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran is by peaceful means that would spare the region\r\nfrom the atrocities of warfare from which its people\r\nhave suffered for the past three decades. Therefore, the\r\nUnited Arab Emirates reiterates its call on the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran to reconsider its position and to\r\nrespond to the peaceful initiative that we announced a\r\nfew years ago, which calls on both countries to engage\r\nin serious bilateral negotiations or to resort to the\r\nInternational Court of Justice, as has been done in other\r\nbilateral issues that have been settled in accordance\r\nwith the principles of the Charter of the United Nations\r\nand the provisions of international law.\r\nThe question of the three occupied islands, which\r\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates, has been on the\r\nagenda of the Security Council since their occupation\r\nby Iran in 1971. In this regard, we reaffirm the\r\ncomplete sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over\r\nGreater Tumb, Lesser Tumb and Abu Moussa and on\r\ntheir regional air space and waters, the continental\r\nshelf and the economic zone of the three islands, which\r\nare considered an indivisible part of the regional\r\nsovereignty of the United Arab Emirates. The United\r\nArab Emirates calls on the Iranian Government to\r\naddress this sensitive and important issue in a positive\r\nspirit in order to end the occupation. We hope that the\r\ncurrent bilateral communications and meetings\r\nbetween the United Arab Emirates and the Islamic\r\nRepublic of Iran will lead to a solution that will cement\r\ntheir good-neighbourly relations, enhance cooperation\r\nand mutual interests between the two countries, and\r\nstrengthen the foundations of security, stability and\r\nprosperity in this important region.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly,\r\nthe world has witnessed many changes in the political\r\nand security fields that have had a strong impact on our\r\ninternational relations, especially those related to peace\r\nand security in the Arab Gulf region. This has had\r\nconsequences and repercussions that may undermine\r\nthe foundations of peace, stability and development in\r\nthe area and the world.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates, which is deeply\r\nconcerned about the continued suffering of the\r\nbrotherly Iraqi people and the deterioration of their\r\nhumanitarian, security, social, economic and\r\nenvironmental conditions, reaffirms that the restoration\r\nof security and stability in Iraq and the country’s return\r\nto the international community will not be achieved\r\nwithout the collective efforts of the regional and\r\ninternational community to help the Iraqi people\r\nreform their constitutional and developmental\r\ninstitutions and to enable them to manage their internal\r\naffairs and external relations with their neighbours and\r\nother countries so that they can play their responsible\r\nand historic role in the region.\r\nWe therefore reiterate our expression of welcome\r\nand support for the efforts made by the provisional\r\nIraqi Governing Council and the interim Iraqi\r\nAdministration. We hope that the United Nations will\r\nplay an increasingly important role in resolving the\r\nsituation in Iraq; in its reconstruction; in maintaining\r\nits territorial integrity, unity and the right of its people\r\nto self-determination; in the election of its\r\nGovernment; in its political future; and in the\r\nexploitation of its natural resources.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has been closely\r\nfollowing the dangerous developments in the occupied\r\nPalestinian territories. We condemn the policies of\r\ntargeted killings and closure being carried out by Israel, in\r\nviolation of all relevant international and humanitarian\r\nlaws. We therefore call upon the Quartet and on other\r\ninfluential countries to revitalize the peace process and\r\nto compel Israel to implement the road map, which\r\nstipulates an end to the Israeli occupation and the\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State by 2005. The road\r\nmap also calls on Israel to refrain from building illegal\r\nsettlements and to ensure the return of the refugees.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nWe demand that Israel cease placing obstacles in\r\nthe way of the implementation of the road map —\r\nobstacles such as the killing and destruction\r\nperpetrated by Israeli occupying forces against\r\nPalestinians and their property in the West Bank and\r\nthe Gaza Strip. We also demand that Israel lift the\r\nunjust siege on President Yasser Arafat and the\r\nPalestinian people, dismantle the separation fence and\r\nrelease Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.\r\nA fair, lasting and comprehensive settlement of\r\nthe Middle East conflict requires a commitment by\r\nIsrael to adhere to international resolutions, which are\r\nbased on the principle of land for peace; the Arab\r\npeace initiative, endorsed by the Beirut Summit,\r\nincluding the Syrian and Lebanese tracks; and Israeli\r\nwithdrawal from all Palestinian and Arab lands\r\noccupied since 1967, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif, the\r\nSyrian Golan and the Lebanese Shaba’a Farms area.\r\nThe Middle East region, including the Arab Gulf,\r\nmust be freed of all weapons of mass destruction, and\r\nIsrael must join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons and subject its nuclear facilities to\r\nthe safeguards of the International Atomic Energy\r\nAgency, pursuant to relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates condemns all forms\r\nand manifestations of terrorism. We call for the\r\nmustering of national, regional and international efforts\r\nto combat and eradicate such a dangerous phenomenon,\r\nbecause it is exploited by radicals and outlaws as\r\nmeans to achieve their destructive goals.\r\nIn this respect, we express our deepest sorrow\r\nfollowing the criminal attack perpetrated against the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters, as well as against the\r\nJordanian Embassy in Baghdad and against the Imam\r\nAli mosque in Najaf, which resulted in the killing of\r\nImam Mohammed Baqer Alhakeem and a number of\r\ninnocent victims. We stand shoulder to shoulder with\r\nthose countries that have been the targets of terrorist\r\ncriminal attacks, in particular our brothers in the\r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. We express our support for\r\nall the measures taken by Saudi Arabia to eradicate\r\nthese terrorist activities.\r\nIn the meantime, we call on the international\r\ncommunity to convene an international conference to\r\ntackle terrorism and eradicate its causes and tools. We\r\nalso reaffirm the importance of respect for human\r\nrights, transparency and openness based on mutual\r\nrespect of the cultural heritage and the beliefs of\r\npeoples, so as to avoid creating a fertile breeding ground\r\nfor frustration and hatred from which the terrorists derive\r\ntheir raison d’être and their motivation.\r\nDespite the numerous international conferences,\r\nparticularly the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment and the International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, aimed at tackling the\r\nimbalance in international economic relations and its\r\neffect on international economic development, the\r\nmajority of the world’s people continue to live in\r\nunstable and inhuman conditions, characterized by\r\nincreased poverty, the spread of disease and illiteracy,\r\nbecause of the increasing economic gap between\r\ndeveloped and developing countries. Developed\r\ncountries must commit to implementing the pledges\r\nthey made according to international resolutions.\r\nFrom this perspective, the United Arab Emirates\r\ncalls on the international community to fulfil its\r\ncommitment to providing development assistance to poor\r\ncountries, in particular the least developed countries.\r\nInternational financial and development institutions as\r\nwell as the private sector should plan strategies geared\r\ntowards providing financial and development resources in\r\norder to implement economic development programmes\r\nin developing and poor countries, all within an\r\nenvironmentally friendly framework, ensuring access by\r\nsuch countries to new technologies, in order to\r\nalleviate the external debt burden and remove tariffs on\r\ninternational trade, which would benefit all countries of\r\nthe world.\r\nOn this occasion, I cannot fail to point out the\r\nconfidence placed in the United Arab Emirates by the\r\ninternational community through its hosting of the\r\nannual meeting of the heads of the International\r\nMonetary Fund and of the World Bank in the Emirate\r\nof Dubai, a meeting that concluded its work on 24\r\nSeptember. We are very satisfied with the outcome of\r\nthat meeting, particularly the special attention it\r\nfocused on the question of development and\r\ncooperation for the purpose of alleviating the impact of\r\npoverty and debt burdens around the world.\r\nIn conclusion, the grave challenges facing the\r\ninternational community today bolster our conviction\r\nmore than ever of the importance of adhering to the\r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of\r\ninternational law, as our point of reference in resolving\r\nregional and international disputes and differences.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nWe express the hope that the meetings and\r\ndebates held during this session of the General\r\nAssembly will succeed in strengthening the role of the\r\nUnited Nations as a multilateral Organization and in\r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: I give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Habib Ben Yahia, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Ben Yahia (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): It\r\ngives me great pleasure to convey to you, Sir, and to\r\nyour friendly country, Saint Lucia, our sincere\r\ncongratulations on your election as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. I am\r\nconfident that your great skills and abilities will\r\nguarantee the success of our proceedings at this\r\nsession. I also would like to express to your\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, deep appreciation for his\r\nremarkable stewardship of the fifty-seventh session.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\r\nextend to Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the\r\nUnited Nations, our thanks and appreciation for his\r\ntireless efforts to strengthen the role of our\r\nOrganization in order to enable it to attain its\r\nobjectives of achieving peace, security and\r\ndevelopment in the world.\r\nSince the opening of the previous Assembly\r\nsession, the world has witnessed a series of\r\ndevelopments that have contributed to the further\r\ndeterioration of global security and stability. Crises and\r\nconflicts are proliferating, while there has been an\r\nincrease in poverty and exclusion and in the spread of\r\ndisease in many parts of the world. Faced with this\r\narray of challenges, the international community is\r\ncalled upon to assume its responsibilities and take\r\nresolute action. All Member States must renew their\r\ncommitment to the noble principles enshrined in the\r\nCharter of the United Nations, work together in the\r\nframework of an international consensus to strengthen\r\nthe role of our Organization in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security and find solutions to current\r\ninternational issues. We are convinced that that is the\r\nbest way to ensure that the world is governed by the\r\nprinciples of dialogue, cooperation and consensus.\r\nThe new challenges facing the international\r\ncommunity and the necessity of establishing relations\r\nbased on justice, equity and harmony, demand that we\r\nunite our efforts to ensure that the United Nations\r\nremains the framework for our common endeavours to\r\npreserve peace and security — the embodiment of\r\ninternational law, to which all countries must be\r\ncommitted and which they must implement in a non-\r\nselective manner, without double standards.\r\nThese new challenges also require the United\r\nNations to enhance its efficiency and improve its\r\nworking methods, taking into account the noble\r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter, by strengthening its\r\nmain organs, particularly the Security Council, which\r\nmust regain its credibility with regard to the maintenance\r\nof international peace and security, and by revitalizing\r\nand enhancing the role of the General Assembly in the\r\ninterests of peace, security and development.\r\nIn this regard, we support the Secretary-General’s\r\ncall to accelerate the introduction of necessary reforms,\r\nand we stress that Tunisia, which has participated in\r\nthe past in the debate on these reforms, stands ready to\r\ncontinue to contribute effectively to international\r\nefforts aimed at achieving this objective, which is now\r\nmore urgent than ever.\r\nMr. Zarif (Islamic Republic of Iran), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nWe are convinced that the deterioration of the\r\nglobal situation requires the international community to\r\nadopt a comprehensive and multidimensional approach,\r\nbased on the interdependence of peace and security on\r\nthe one hand, and development on the other. We\r\nbelieve that peace and security cannot prevail\r\nthroughout the world unless the development needs of\r\nall peoples are addressed. We also recognize that\r\ndevelopment cannot be achieved in the absence of\r\nsecurity and peace for all.\r\nOf course the pursuit of such an objective will\r\nrequire all members of the international community to\r\npool their efforts and show greater solidarity so as to\r\neliminate the root causes of tension and to eradicate\r\npoverty and deprivation, which are breeding grounds\r\nfor trouble and instability.\r\nSince the change of 7 November 1987, Tunisia\r\nhas called for the adoption of such an approach and has\r\npresented, at the regional and international levels,\r\nnumerous initiatives and proposals, whose objective is\r\nto build the foundation for a world with a greater\r\ncapacity to attain the goal of peace, security and\r\ndevelopment and to spread the values of dialogue,\r\ntolerance and solidarity among all peoples.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nIn this context, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\r\nof Tunisia called in 1989, from this lofty rostrum, for\r\nthe conclusion of a pact for peace and progress in the\r\nframework of the United Nations, drawing together the\r\ncountries of the North and the South and based on\r\npeace and justice and the strengthening of cooperation\r\namong all countries of the world.\r\nAll the initiatives and proposals put forward by\r\nthe President of Tunisia since that date have been\r\nconsistent with that call, as they stem from the\r\ndetermination of Tunisia and its President to ensure the\r\neffectiveness of our country’s contribution to\r\naddressing issues of peace, security and development,\r\nparticularly in relation to the phenomenon of terrorism\r\nand the means of combating it and to the\r\nimplementation of mechanisms for conflict resolution\r\nin the Arab and African regions.\r\nIn line with the comprehensive character of the\r\nTunisian approach, the President of Tunisia has\r\nconsistently called on the international community to\r\nhelp developing countries strengthen their economies\r\nthrough a number of regional and international\r\ninitiatives such as those related to debt relief, in\r\nparticular debt recycling for middle-income countries;\r\nthe transfer of science and technology to developing\r\ncountries and a call for the convening of a world\r\nsummit on the information society.\r\nPresident Ben Ali also called for the\r\ndissemination of the values of solidarity and\r\ncompassion as a means of contributing to the\r\neradication of poverty, marginalization and exclusion\r\nin all parts of the world — a call that led to the\r\nestablishment of the World Solidarity Fund.\r\nTunisia, which has succeeded in creating a\r\nsecure, stable and well-balanced society that is\r\nintegrated into the mainstream of the modern world,\r\nbelieves that the well-being of humankind is the\r\nultimate objective and, on the basis of its own national\r\nexperience, that the fight against extremism and\r\nterrorism, which constitute a serious threat to the entire\r\nworld, cannot succeed unless it is comprehensive and\r\nmultidimensional in nature and takes into account not\r\nonly the security dimension but also the need to\r\naddress the root causes of the phenomenon.\r\nWe therefore underscore the necessity of working\r\nto develop a common international approach to fighting\r\nthe phenomenon of extremism and terrorism, taking\r\ninto account all relevant international conventions.\r\nIn this context, pending the achievement of the\r\nnecessary progress in the adoption of a comprehensive\r\ninternational mechanism to fight terrorism, we would\r\nlike to reiterate Tunisia’s call for the conclusion of a\r\ncode of conduct to fight terrorism, to which all\r\ncountries adhere and which will include the principles\r\naround which a consensus could be built. Such a code\r\nof conduct could constitute a common denominator in\r\ncollectively confronting this phenomenon. An\r\ninternational conference could be convened to lay the\r\ngroundwork for such a code of conduct.\r\nThe wide international support enjoyed by the\r\nproposal to establish the World Solidarity Fund\r\ntestifies to the need for such a mechanism, which is\r\naimed at reducing the suffering, poverty, exclusion and\r\nmarginalization endured by a great number of peoples\r\nthroughout the world, particularly in Africa.\r\nWhile we reiterate our sincere gratitude to\r\nMember States for their support for this initiative, we\r\nremain convinced that, as the Fund was set up in\r\nFebruary 2003 and has become one of the official\r\nmechanisms of the United Nations system, Member\r\nStates will spare no effort in speeding up its\r\noperationalization, thus allowing it to begin its\r\nactivities as soon as possible and thereby contribute to\r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals. We therefore urge the international community\r\nand all relevant actors, including State and private\r\norganizations, to mobilize the necessary financial\r\nresources for the Fund so as to allow it to fulfil its\r\nnoble humanitarian objectives. It is also imperative, in\r\nthis regard, to speed up the establishment of the\r\nproposed high-level committee, whose task is to define\r\nthe strategy of the World Solidarity Fund and to\r\nmobilize the resources needed for its activities.\r\nThe widening digital gap between industrialized\r\nand developing countries requires us to take the\r\nnecessary practical measures to enable all countries of\r\nthe world to take advantage of the broad prospects\r\nprovided by the technological revolution in the field of\r\ncommunications. In that context, Tunisia called for the\r\nconvening of a World Summit on the Information\r\nSociety. We are now intensifying our preparation for\r\nthe second phase of that Summit, which will be held in\r\nTunis in November 2005.\r\nWhile expressing its determination to contribute\r\neffectively to the first phase, which is due to be held in\r\nGeneva in December this year, Tunisia will do its\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nutmost to ensure that the Tunis summit will constitute\r\nan opportunity to elaborate a common approach, in\r\norder to contribute to strengthening cooperation\r\nbetween all members of the international community\r\nand to consolidate the role of information and\r\ncommunication technologies in development. We are\r\nconfident that the member States that chose Tunisia to\r\nhost the Summit will do their utmost to make the\r\nsummit a success.\r\nConvinced of the role of sports in strengthening the\r\nbonds of friendship, cooperation and rapprochement\r\nbetween peoples, and taking into account the\r\nimportance of physical education as an instrument to\r\nconsolidate the foundations of peace and promote\r\ndevelopment in the world, Tunisia decided to present to\r\nthis session of the General Assembly a draft resolution\r\nproclaiming the year 2004 an international year of\r\nsports and physical education in the service of peace\r\nand development. We express the hope that this\r\nproposal, which has already received the support of the\r\nAfrican Union and the Organization of the Islamic\r\nConference, will get wide support from the international\r\ncommunity and other international sports bodies.\r\nThe Middle East continues to suffer from a cycle\r\nof violence and tension. The road map, which Tunisia\r\nsupported, revived hope for the resumption of the\r\npeace process. However, that hope was soon faced with\r\nIsrael’s insistence on imposing the reality of occupation\r\nand continuous military campaigns against the Palestinian\r\npeople, including the decision to expel President Yasser\r\nArafat, despite the Palestinian Authority’s readiness to\r\nfulfil its commitments in the framework of the road\r\nmap. In the face of the deteriorating situation, we\r\nbelieve that the international community, particularly\r\nthe members of the Quartet, should not allow the will\r\nof peace to be defeated and should therefore spare no\r\neffort to enhance the peace process.\r\nWhile reiterating its attachment to the peace\r\nprocess and its determination to contribute effectively\r\nto its success, Tunisia stresses the need to respect the\r\nlegitimacy of the Palestinian Authority and its\r\nleadership, chosen freely by the Palestinian people. We\r\nalso believe that, given the continuing tragic conditions\r\nof the Palestinian people, it is high time to heed the call\r\nmade by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali during the\r\nExtraordinary Arab Summit held in Cairo in October\r\n2000 to provide the Palestinian people with\r\ninternational protection, particularly as that call was\r\nsupported by many States.\r\nThe ongoing suffering of the Iraqi people is a\r\nsource of great concern and profound preoccupation for\r\nthe international community. While remaining attached\r\nto the principle of the independence and territorial\r\nintegrity of Iraq, we wish to emphasize the need for the\r\ninternational community to join hands and for the\r\nUnited Nations to assume its central role to ensure that\r\npeace and stability prevail in that fraternal country,\r\nthus allowing for the start of reconstruction and the\r\nreturn to normal life for the Iraqi people.\r\nIn that regard, Tunisia hopes that the adoption of\r\nthe first steps, which were welcomed by Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1500 (2003), will lead as soon as\r\npossible to restoration of the sovereignty of the Iraqi\r\npeople. Furthermore, while condemning in the\r\nstrongest possible terms the terrorist attack against the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad, we pay a\r\ntribute to the Secretary-General, who, despite the\r\ngravity of that painful attack, decided to let the United\r\nNations continue to pursue its efforts of helping the\r\nIraqi people overcome their present predicament.\r\nTunisia attaches great importance to the various\r\nforms of integration and partnership within the regional\r\ngroupings it belongs to. In that regard, we avail\r\nourselves of this opportunity to express our deep\r\nsatisfaction following the agreement reached between\r\nsisterly Libya and the United States, Great Britain and\r\nFrance on the issues relating to the Lockerbie and\r\nUnion de transports aériens incidents, following\r\nTripoli’s fulfilment of all its commitments under the\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We have no\r\ndoubt that, now that the sanctions have been\r\ncompletely lifted, Libya will fully resume its role in the\r\nMaghreb and Mediterranean regions, thus contributing\r\nto reinvigorating the Arab Maghreb Union, which will\r\nhelp promote more complementarity and integration\r\nbetween the countries of the region and will\r\nconsolidate the foundations of security, stability and\r\nprosperity in the Maghreb, Arab, African and\r\nMediterranean areas.\r\nThe settlement of this dispute augurs well, as it\r\ncoincides with the preparations Tunisia is undertaking to\r\nhost the first summit of the 5+5 dialogue, to be held in\r\nDecember 2003, among the countries of the Maghreb and\r\nthe European countries of the western Mediterranean.\r\nWe look forward to this event as a step towards\r\nenhancing partnership between the countries of the\r\nregion and deepening the values of dialogue, tolerance\r\nand moderation among the peoples of that region.\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nConvinced of the need to strengthen common\r\nArab action and to consolidate the role of the League\r\nof Arab States to enable it to attain its noble objectives,\r\nTunisia shall endeavour, during its presidency of the\r\nnext Arab Summit in 2004, to further strengthen the\r\nbonds of cooperation, solidarity and complementarity\r\namong the Arab countries.\r\nThe most recent African Union Summit, held in\r\nMaputo in July 2003, marked the beginning of the\r\nlaunching process of the African Union. The African\r\nUnion is determined to achieve the objective of\r\nrevitalizing the African continent and to confront the\r\nserious challenges it faces. The Union hopes to get the\r\nnecessary international support in order to achieve its\r\ngoals.\r\nUndoubtedly, the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which is bringing a new vision\r\nfor a serious and constructive partnership with the\r\nUnited Nations system, its specialized agencies, the\r\ndeveloped countries and other relevant institutions,\r\ndeserves the support of the international community.\r\nSuch support constitutes an incentive for the African\r\nUnion to attempt to meet legitimate African needs and\r\naddress all aspects of marginalization in our continent.\r\nThe difficult global economic environment has\r\nhad an adverse impact on the economies of the\r\ndeveloping countries in general and the African\r\neconomies in particular. Fierce trade competition and\r\nprotectionist measures, as well as currency fluctuations\r\nand the exacerbation of the debt burden, constitute\r\nmajor constraints that have impeded progress of the\r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn that regard, we emphasize the need for all\r\ninternational partners to show the political will necessary\r\nto implement the commitments of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals, as well as the outcomes of major\r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits, notably the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment held in Monterrey and the World Summit\r\non Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, if\r\nwe are to overcome this difficult situation and provide\r\nfresh impetus to development efforts.\r\nThe difficult situation we face today should not\r\ndiscourage us or weaken our determination to achieve\r\nthe objectives of peace, security and stability. We must\r\nshow patience, resolve and perseverance and\r\ncollectively pledge to strengthen the United Nations\r\nand make this session a new starting point for our\r\nOrganization in order to enable it to effectively play its\r\nrole and respond to our collective aspirations for a\r\nmore secure and stable world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Nguyen Dy Nien, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Dy Nien (Viet Nam): On behalf of\r\nthe delegation of Viet Nam, I wish to warmly\r\ncongratulate Julian Hunte on his assumption of the\r\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I believe that under his able guidance this\r\nsession will come to a fruitful conclusion. I also take\r\nthis opportunity to express our great appreciation for\r\nthe significant contributions made by Mr. Jan Kavan\r\nduring the previous session of the General Assembly.\r\nEarlier last month, we were all shocked and\r\nshared in the boundless grief over the tragic demise of\r\nour dear Sergio Vieira de Mello, United Nations High\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, and\r\nhis colleagues in the barbarous bombing of the United\r\nNations offices in Baghdad. We will not be discouraged\r\nby that loss. Instead, we should pursue even further the\r\nefforts of the United Nations to help the Iraqi people to\r\nrestore stability and reconstruct their country.\r\nWe are living in a world full of events with\r\nprofound implications for the various aspects of\r\ninternational life. They include the war in Iraq, the\r\nbombing of the United Nations offices in Baghdad, the\r\noutbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\r\n(SARS), increased violence in the Middle East, as well\r\nas continuing terrorist attacks in various parts of the\r\nworld. Coupled with poverty, disease, floods, droughts\r\nand conflicts, they continue to take many innocent\r\nlives. This breaks our hearts and should not be\r\ncondoned, especially when mankind has entered the\r\nthird millennium of human civilization. We must make\r\nfull use of the great achievements registered in the\r\nareas of science and technology and economy and\r\ntrade, uphold the values of civilization, and serve the\r\ncommon development and prosperity of all nations.\r\nStrengthening international peace and security\r\nand enhancing development remain our primary task.\r\nOnly in an environment of peace and stability can\r\nnations concentrate their energy to meet the challenges\r\nof development and to achieve poverty eradication.\r\nHealthy, equitable international relations can be built\r\nonly on the principles of the United Nations Charter\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nand international law, in particular the principle of\r\nrespect for national independence, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity and the principle of non-\r\ninterference in the internal affairs of States.\r\nDevelopment cooperation and international\r\neconomic and trade relations can be built only when all\r\nparticipate on an equal footing, on the basis of mutual\r\nbenefit and with favourable assistance to developing\r\ncountries. However, there continue to be certain egoistic\r\ntendencies that are contrary to that good. Protectionist\r\nmeasures, including anti-dumping measures, have been\r\nimposed to prevent developing countries’ products from\r\nentering developed countries’ markets. That runs\r\ncounter not only to World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nagreements but also to normal trade practices.\r\nA typical case was that of the recent unfair\r\nlawsuit against the sale of Viet Nam’s catfish in the\r\nUnited States market. The same story recurs in the case\r\nof cotton-growers in Burkina Faso and again in the\r\ncase of indigenous cultivators of medicinal herbs in\r\nBrazil. These examples should serve as a further lesson\r\nthat developing countries will always be at a\r\ndisadvantage in the current international trade system,\r\nas the Secretary-General himself recently observed. By\r\nthe same token, the failure to reach agreement at the\r\nfifth WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún is truly\r\nregrettable. We must enhance efforts to restructure the\r\nworld trade and financial systems to make them more\r\ndemocratic and open, giving developing countries a\r\nbetter chance.\r\nDespite the considerable efforts by the United\r\nNations to achieve the goals set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration, there is still a long way to go to meet\r\ncommon needs and expectations. Today, global\r\nproblems increasingly affect human security and\r\nsurvival. The SARS outbreak and AIDS were examples\r\nof how devastating such problems can be.\r\nWe must be resolute in solving global problems,\r\nespecially those related to development, poverty\r\neradication and disease prevention. Priority should be\r\ngiven to building cooperative frameworks based on\r\nreliable partnerships, mutual respect, shared responsibility\r\nand the serious undertaking of commitments. Practical\r\nand effective measures must be taken to pursue the United\r\nNations Millennium Development Goals and the\r\ncommitments made at various international\r\nconferences. In that regard, we welcome the efforts of\r\nthe Secretary-General to elaborate a road map for the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWe also call upon developed countries to better fulfil\r\nthe commitment of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross\r\nnational product to official development assistance.\r\nMultilateralism is crucial to resolving global\r\nissues. The United Nations, the universal Organization,\r\ncontinues to play an important role in the fields of\r\npeace and development and in building healthy\r\ninternational relations; to meet the confidence and\r\nexpectations of nations, it must do so more effectively\r\nand practically. That requires a stronger and more\r\ndemocratic United Nations and Security Council,\r\nensuring the better representation of the developing\r\ncountries and those able to make a positive\r\ncontribution to common objectives. I wish to reaffirm\r\nViet Nam’s support for Japan, Germany, India and\r\nother capable members from various continents being\r\namong the future permanent members of a reformed\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFollowing the events of 11 September 2001, the\r\nworld has made great efforts to combat terrorism. The\r\nmessage is very clear: terrorism must be condemned\r\nand eliminated from human civilization. As this\r\ncommon fight may be long and arduous, we need to\r\ncooperate on the basis of the principles of the United\r\nNations Charter, as well as to join in an endeavour to\r\nsolve, inter alia, the problems of poverty, injustice and\r\noppression, which give rise to terrorism.\r\nViet Nam supports international efforts aimed at\r\ndisarmament and at the peaceful resolution of conflicts\r\non the basis of respect for the sovereignty and\r\nlegitimate interests of the parties concerned. We call\r\nfor an end to embargoes and sanctions imposed against\r\nother countries, especially the unilateral embargo\r\nagainst Cuba that for many decades has caused its\r\npeople to endure untold suffering.\r\nPeace, security and reconstruction are now the\r\nmost urgent tasks in Iraq. Viet Nam reaffirms its\r\nsupport for Iraq’s independence and sovereignty. We\r\nhope that stability will soon be restored and that a\r\nGovernment chosen by the Iraqi people will be\r\nestablished at an early date so that they can focus on\r\nnational reconstruction and development in keeping\r\nwith their self-determination. The United Nations\r\nshould continue its worthy, active role in resolving the\r\nIraqi issue and in reconstructing the country. In that\r\nregard, Viet Nam has decided to contribute\r\nhumanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people.\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nViet Nam reaffirms its consistent support for the\r\njust cause and inalienable rights of the Palestinian\r\npeople. We call upon the parties concerned to exercise\r\nrestraint, to persevere in negotiation and to accelerate\r\ntheir pace on the road to a just and durable peace in the\r\nMiddle East that takes due account of the legitimate\r\ninterests of the parties. Any unilateral action can only\r\nworsen the already volatile situation in the region.\r\nViet Nam supports peaceful efforts aimed at\r\ndenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We hope that\r\nthe negotiations initiated through the six-party talks in\r\nBeijing last August will lead to a satisfactory\r\nconclusion for the sake of peace, stability and\r\ndevelopment on the Peninsula, in the region and in the\r\nrest of the world.\r\nIn our region, faced with complex and rapid\r\ndevelopments and challenges in the international and\r\nregional landscape, the Association of South-East\r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) has produced new initiatives\r\nand concrete steps to strengthen its solidarity,\r\nresilience and equitable development while further\r\nintensifying its relations with friends and partners\r\nabroad. At its forthcoming Summit, to be held early\r\nnext month in Bali, Indonesia, ASEAN will redouble\r\nits efforts to realize ASEAN Vision 2020, the Hanoi\r\nPlan of Action and the Hanoi Declaration on narrowing\r\nthe development gap for closer ASEAN integration.\r\nAs an outward-looking association, ASEAN\r\ncontinues to attach great importance to broadening and\r\ndeepening its relations with other countries. China,\r\nRussia and India will accede to the ASEAN Treaty of\r\nAmity and Cooperation in South-East Asia, thus\r\nmaking the Treaty the code of conduct in inter-State\r\nrelations. Having adopted the Declaration on the\r\nConduct of Parties in the South China Sea, ASEAN\r\nand China are embarking on a search for concrete ways\r\nto implement the Declaration, thus contributing to\r\nconfidence and cooperation in that important part of\r\nthe world. In the economic field, ASEAN has been\r\ndiscussing closer economic partnership, including a\r\npossible free trade agreement, with its dialogue\r\npartners — the United States, the European Union,\r\nRussia and India, to name only a few.\r\nViet Nam consistently pursues a foreign policy of\r\nnational independence, self-reliance, openness,\r\ndiversification and multilateralization of international\r\nrelations, and being a friend and reliable partner in the\r\ninternational community. Along those lines, Viet Nam\r\nhas increasingly enhanced friendly and cooperative\r\nrelations with other countries as well as with regional\r\nand international organizations. At present, we are\r\nactively preparing for Viet Nam’s early admission to\r\nthe World Trade Organization. With an annual\r\neconomic growth rate of approximately 7 per cent, a\r\nfavourable and secure investment environment,\r\nhospitable people, beautiful landscapes and other\r\nrewarding discoveries, Viet Nam continues to be a\r\nmost attractive country for investors and tourists. Later\r\nthis year, we will host the South-East Asian Games, the\r\nlargest sports event in the region. Next will be the\r\nAsia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit in 2004,\r\nfollowed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\n(APEC) Summit in 2006. We are confident that we will\r\nlive up to expectations.\r\nToday’s challenges, both old and new, are\r\nbecoming global; they require measures of a more\r\nglobal and multilateral nature. The United Nations\r\ntherefore plays an important role in coordinating\r\ninternational efforts to effectively respond to those\r\nchallenges and to work for peace and development. In that\r\nregard, the principles of the United Nations Charter must\r\nbe upheld, and their actual implementation must be\r\nensured. For its part, Viet Nam, as a responsible Member\r\nState and reliable partner, will continue to contribute\r\nactively to that common endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jean Ping, Minister of State and\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and la\r\nFrancophonie of Gabon.\r\nMr. Ping (Gabon) (spoke in French): Permit me\r\nat the outset to express to Assembly President Julian\r\nHunte the congratulations of my country, Gabon, on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nthis session. Indeed, his election has symbolic value,\r\nsince, through him, Saint Lucia has become — as he\r\nhimself said — the smallest country ever to have\r\noccupied that high office. Is that not a perfect\r\nillustration of the universal vocation of the\r\nOrganization, which recognizes the equality and rights\r\nof all its Members, small and large, but also their\r\ncommon responsibility in the conduct of the world’s\r\naffairs? Gabon expresses to him its wishes for success\r\nin leading this session, and we assure him of our full\r\ncooperation. We also congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan, who\r\npreceded Mr. Hunte in his office, on the work that he\r\naccomplished. In addition, we thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the self-sacrifice and\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\ncourage with which he is leading the Organization at\r\nthis time of grave world turbulence.\r\nThe extreme seriousness of the situation facing\r\nthe world today sometimes leads the United Nations,\r\nwhen States are unable to carry out responsibilities that\r\nin principle devolve to them, to assume those\r\nresponsibilities.\r\nAs the United Nations carries out its difficult\r\nmission, its authority, unfortunately, is quite often\r\nsorely tested, and the very lives of its personnel are\r\nthreatened. The tragic death of Sergio Vieira de Mello,\r\none of the torch-bearers of the ideals of the United\r\nNations, and other staff members in Baghdad on 19\r\nAugust is a dreadful reminder of just how fragile\r\ninternational peace and security are. Nevertheless,\r\ndespite the delicate nature of the situation, the\r\nactivities of the United Nations must be pursued in Iraq\r\nto assist in the reconstruction of the country.\r\nBeyond Iraq, the future of the entire Middle East\r\nregion must be at the centre of all our attention. The\r\nroad map remains, despite current threats to its\r\nenforcement, the sole hope to restore peace between\r\nthe parties to the conflict and sustainable regional\r\nbalance to the Middle East. Gabon urges the two\r\nparties to end the violence and resume their dialogue.\r\nDespite the persistence of some hotbeds of\r\ntension, the overall situation in Africa has witnessed\r\npositive changes. In the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, the peace process has begun to be implemented\r\nwith the creation in June 2003 of a Transitional\r\nGovernment, whose chief mission is the establishment\r\nof new democratic institutions and preparations for\r\nelections.\r\nIt goes without saying that the security and\r\nstability of the country continues to depend on that of\r\nthe entire Great Lakes region. This is why Gabon\r\nardently desires the completion of the Arusha process\r\nin Burundi. After a period of uncertainty, the Central\r\nAfrican Republic is also restoring peace, particularly\r\nthanks to specific pacification measures taken by the\r\ncountry’s new authorities.\r\nTo complement their efforts, the Central African\r\nEconomic and Monetary Community, which met in\r\nLibreville in June 2003, decided to make an ad hoc\r\ncontribution of 5 billion francs CFA to the Central\r\nAfrican Republic.\r\nFor its part, Gabon has always actively worked\r\nfor peacekeeping and peace-building in Africa. This\r\nwas recently demonstrated again in Sâo Tomé and\r\nPríncipe, where the good offices of President Bongo and\r\nhis African peers, particularly those from the Economic\r\nCommunity of Central African States, contributed to the\r\nrestoration of constitutional order in the country.\r\nUnfortunately, these welcome events are at\r\nvariance with our inability to react promptly to some\r\ncrisis situations that jeopardize collective security and\r\ncause gross violations of human rights. We must\r\nassume a two-fold duty today: to strengthen our\r\ncollective means of conflict prevention and, when\r\nthose efforts do not obtain results, to have the capacity\r\nto react swiftly to contain armed conflicts before their\r\nescalation brings about new humanitarian disasters, as\r\nwas recently the case in the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo and Liberia.\r\nAfrican countries have shown their ability to\r\nmanage crises on many occasions. But their will is\r\nmost often impeded by the scarcity of human resources\r\nand lack of appropriate logistical means. To facilitate\r\nthe prompt deployment of peacekeeping forces in these\r\nregions, should we not establish, under the auspices of\r\nthe United Nation, a partnership between African\r\ncountries and the developed countries that provide\r\nlogistical support.\r\nBecause many conflicts are rooted in poverty, any\r\neffort to resolve them must be based on the quest for\r\nefficient solutions to the problems inherent in\r\nunderdevelopment. The Monterrey Consensus, reaffirmed\r\nduring the Johannesburg Summit, is based on the\r\nrecognition that financing for development is a crucial\r\nelement for an international strategy for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. The drop in private international\r\ninvestment in developing countries is liable to hinder\r\nthem from truly recovering. Moreover, many of these\r\ncountries, in particular those known as medium-income\r\ncountries like Gabon, continue to devote huge\r\nresources to repay external debt. Gabon remains\r\nconvinced that only a courageous strategy to defer or\r\ncancel debt would enable the economic recovery of the\r\ncountries involved.\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has become a\r\ndevelopment problem, also deserves our attention. The\r\ndisease is now the leading cause of death among\r\nwomen and the young in Africa. In other words, its\r\nmain victims are our nations’ hope. We welcome the\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nfact that the high-level plenary debate that took place\r\nlast week at United Nations Headquarters itself\r\nreaffirmed the commitment of the international\r\ncommunity to combat this horrifying disease.\r\nThe ills that the world is facing should prompt us\r\nto identify the structural causes and find the best way\r\nto respond. This is particularly true with respect to the\r\nfight against international terrorism. One vital stage in\r\nthis process is the establishment of a legal framework\r\nconducive to effective international cooperation.\r\nWe must finalize without delay the negotiations\r\nto adopt a universal convention against international\r\nterrorism in all its forms, including the issue of the\r\nacquisition of arsenals of weapons of mass destruction\r\nby terrorist groups.\r\nThe positive forces that drive our world towards\r\ngreater integration and solidarity are increasingly\r\njeopardized by growing threats. Because the new\r\nchallenges of our world have a global impact, we must\r\nrespond collectively. Only close coordination and\r\nactive multilateral cooperation will enable us to meet\r\nthem. It is within the United Nations, a high-level\r\nforum for dialogue and cooperation, that we can\r\nachieve this objective.\r\nTo do so, as we have stressed during the previous\r\nsession, we must strengthen our Organization,\r\nparticularly by restoring the role of the General\r\nAssembly and reforming the Security Council. We\r\nagree on the principle. May we thus have the courage\r\nand will to harmonize our views to attain this ideal of\r\nchange and strengthen the multilateral dimension of\r\nour Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Halldór Ásgrímsson, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and External Trade of Iceland.\r\nMr. Ásgrímsson (Iceland): Allow me at the\r\noutset to congratulate the President on his election to\r\nthe presidency of this General Assembly. The role of\r\nthe President in providing overall leadership to the\r\nAssembly is crucial and I am confident he will guide us\r\nwisely through the complex tasks ahead of us.\r\nA month from now, a group of young people will\r\ngather at the University of Iceland to take part in a\r\nmodel United Nations conference. It is good to see\r\nsuch enthusiasm for the ideals of the United Nations\r\namong young people — as well as a desire to\r\nexperiment with how the United Nations machinery\r\nworks in practice. But I wonder whether their model\r\nwill accurately reflect how our United Nations works. I\r\nam concerned that, if it does, will it increase or dampen\r\ntheir enthusiasm?\r\nIf they were to model the General Assembly, I\r\nsuspect that their model would contrast in a number of\r\nways with the real thing. Their agenda would be more\r\nconcise. They would concentrate on pure and more\r\nimmediate issues of urgency. They would have little\r\ntime for often-repeated resolutions whose relevance is\r\nchiefly historical. They would not allow such items to\r\ncrowd out more immediate matters. They would\r\naddress the world as it is, not the world of yesteryear.\r\nTo be honest, I am worried that the more accurately their\r\nUnited Nations model reflected the real thing, be it the\r\nGeneral Assembly or the Security Council, the more\r\ndifficult it would be to explain to those young idealists\r\nour purpose and convince them of our effectiveness.\r\nAs already stated by my Danish colleague, on\r\nbehalf of the Nordic countries, I would very much like\r\nto welcome the proposal of the Secretary-General to\r\nestablish a high-level panel of eminent personalities to\r\nmake recommendations on issues ranging from peace\r\nand security to reform of United Nations structures.\r\nThe General Assembly has tremendous achievements\r\nto its credit. It is, as we affirmed in our Millennium\r\nDeclaration, the chief deliberative policy-making and\r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. The\r\nachievements of the General Assembly in international\r\nnorm-setting and in the establishment of an\r\ninternational legal framework is undisputed. Its\r\npotential is great but, as the young people at our United\r\nNations model would bluntly point out, it needs fixing.\r\nIf we believe the General Assembly is where\r\ndeliberation should be carried out, let us ensure that the\r\nagenda and procedures allow debate and deliberation to\r\ntake place in an interactive manner. If we believe that it\r\nis the chief policy-making body, let us ensure that it\r\ndevelops policy, perhaps by linking debate more\r\nclosely with the decision-making process. Policy needs\r\nto be followed-up; we need to do more on\r\nimplementation. My delegation will contribute actively\r\nand constructively in the forthcoming deliberations on\r\nreforms of the General Assembly during this session.\r\nOur young people at the United Nations model\r\nnext month will in fact be modelling the Security\r\nCouncil. I suspect that they will raise some questions\r\nabout the composition of that body. Iceland is seriously\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nconcerned with the slow progress in the open-ended\r\nworking group. Though it provides, for the time being,\r\nthe appropriate forum for continued dialogue, Iceland\r\nwould welcome any additional initiatives to further\r\nintensify the process towards satisfactory resolution of\r\nthis important matter.\r\nThe Icelandic position on the reform of the Security\r\nCouncil is on record. It is essential that the membership of\r\nthe Council better reflect the membership of the United\r\nNations as a whole. At the same time, the efficiency of\r\nthe Council must be preserved. Further steps should be\r\ntaken to increase transparency in the decision-making\r\nprocess, in order to build on the welcome steps already\r\ntaken by the Council.\r\nIceland supports an increase in both permanent and\r\nnon-permanent seats at the Council. New permanent\r\nmembers should have the same rights and obligations as\r\nthe current permanent members. The veto right should\r\nbe restricted and an obligation to state the reason for its\r\nuse should be established, including why a permanent\r\nmember considers a matter to be of vital importance.\r\nIceland has, for the first time, put forward its\r\ncandidacy for membership of the Security Council for\r\nthe years 2009 and 2010. We see participation in the\r\nSecurity Council as a logical expression of our\r\ndetermination to fulfil our responsibilities within the\r\nUnited Nations and contribute as an active member of\r\nthe international community.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights must\r\nbe a central concern of all United Nations activities. In\r\nthis regard, much more needs to be done to implement\r\nour commitment regarding the rights of women and the\r\nrights of the child. Iceland has signed the United\r\nNations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish\r\nTrafficking in Persons and has enacted legislation\r\nagainst trafficking in human beings. Iceland is working\r\nagainst the trafficking of women through a common\r\ncampaign with the other Nordic countries and the\r\nBaltic States. The Icelandic campaign will focus on\r\ninforming and increasing awareness among the public\r\nabout this issue.\r\nWe should be especially aware of the implications\r\nfor human rights of new threats and new policies. In\r\nparticular, we must ensure that fundamental human\r\nrights are not violated in our counter-terrorist effort, as\r\nhas been underlined by the Secretary-General.\r\nIn Iraq, the United Nations itself has recently\r\nbeen the target of two terrorist attacks. I would like to\r\nuse this opportunity to express the most sincere\r\ncondolences on behalf of the Icelandic Government to\r\nthe United Nations and the families of the United\r\nNations officials who lost their lives. I would also like\r\nto wish those who were wounded full recovery.\r\nThe United Nations and the Security Council in\r\nparticular must address the issue of Iraq. Iceland, along\r\nwith many other Member States, is contributing to\r\nIraq’s reconstruction and will continue to do so. The\r\nsituation will demand all our resourcefulness and a\r\nconcerted effort at cooperation by all parties in the\r\nSecurity Council to ensure that the people of Iraq are\r\nassured the destiny they deserve. This destiny should\r\nencompass peace and democracy, affording equal rights\r\nand justice to all Iraqi citizens.\r\nOn terrorists, renewed efforts must be made to\r\nreach an agreement on a universal definition during\r\nthis General Assembly. Such a definition would make\r\nthe fight against terrorists more effective.\r\nIt is estimated that close to 90 per cent of victims\r\nin today’s armed conflicts are civilians, the majority of\r\nwhom are women and children. Women and girls\r\nexperience conflicts differently than men because of\r\ntheir status in society. Their rights must be protected in\r\nsituations of armed conflict and we must ensure that\r\nwomen play a central role in conflict prevention,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building. United Nations\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) lays the\r\nground rules for this to happen and must be\r\nimplemented in all of its aspects.\r\nIt is our role to ensure that globalization benefits\r\nall countries, not least through targeted development\r\ncooperation. Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to be the\r\nfocus of our bilateral development cooperation while we\r\nwill also increase our contribution and involvement in\r\nmultilateral development cooperation, especially through\r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the United\r\nNations Population Fund, the United Nations Children’s\r\nFund, the United Nations Development Fund for\r\nWomen and the World Food Programme.\r\nI just returned, like many others, from Cancún,\r\nwhere we had difficult discussions on correcting the trade\r\nrules so that developing countries can operate on a more\r\nlevel playing field in world trade. This work is vital and\r\nwe must push on with it. With determination we can\r\nbreak through the impasse that we reached in Cancún.\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nIceland is one of the many island States in the\r\nworld whose well-being and development is crucially\r\naffected by the state of the marine environment.\r\nSustainable harvesting of living marine resources is the\r\nmainstay of our economy. Resolution 57/141, on\r\nOceans and the Law of the Sea, which was adopted\r\nduring our last session, provides for the establishment\r\nof a regular process for the global reporting and\r\nassessment of the state of the marine environment,\r\ncommonly referred to as Global Marine Assessment, a\r\nconcept that was initiated by Iceland in 1999.\r\nAn intergovernmental meeting should be\r\nconvened in 2004 to decide upon the modalities of this\r\nprocess and negotiate an agreement between United\r\nNations agencies. It is our sincere hope that such a\r\nmeeting could turn out to be fruitful in the process of\r\nthe establishment of the Global Marine Assessment.\r\nWe must craft for ourselves a United Nations\r\nwhich is task-oriented, representative, focused and\r\ncoordinated. I believe strongly that the United Nations\r\nshould not only be a place where we can talk about\r\nwhat we want to do, it must also be the place and\r\ninstrument to get things done. We have taken note of\r\nthe Secretary-General’s call for changes in our\r\ninstitution by 2005.\r\nThere are varying opinions on how the United\r\nNations should operate, but I believe there is a general\r\nrecognition that the United Nations is, and must\r\nremain, the key forum in which we exercise our\r\ncollective responsibility. At the Millennium Summit,\r\nheads of State and Government reaffirmed their faith in\r\nthe Organization and its Charter as indispensable\r\nfoundations of a more peaceful, prosperous and just\r\nworld. They defined our priorities for this century and\r\nresolved to make the United Nations a more effective\r\ninstrument for pursuing all of these priorities. It is up\r\nto us, the Member States, to make it possible for the\r\nUnited Nations to realize these objectives.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. Fiorenzo Stolfi, Minister for Foreign\r\nand Political Affairs of San Marino.\r\nMr. Stolfi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of\r\nthe Government of the Republic of San Marino, let me\r\ncongratulate Mr. Julian Hunte on his election to the\r\npresidency of the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. His election brings us great satisfaction\r\nsince he also represents a small country, Saint Lucia,\r\nlike ours.\r\nI also wish to express my country’s appreciation\r\nfor the fruitful work and remarkable abilities of former\r\nAssembly President Jan Kavan. It has been a privilege\r\nfor us to cooperate with him.\r\nI cannot start my speech without mentioning the\r\ncowardly attacks on the United Nations offices in\r\nBaghdad, which took a heavy toll of lives including\r\nthat of Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative\r\nof the United Nations Secretary-General in Iraq.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of San\r\nMarino, I take this opportunity to reiterate our most\r\nsincere condolences to the Secretary-General and the\r\nfamilies of the victims. Furthermore, we would like to\r\nexpress our deep appreciation to the United Nations for\r\nthe fundamental role it is playing in Iraq during this\r\ndifficult transition period for the Iraqi people. The\r\nnecessary conditions for social and economic\r\ndevelopment will be established only through security\r\nand stability, independence and democracy, the rule of\r\nlaw and respect for human rights.\r\nIn light of the above, I wish to express the hope\r\nthat the transitional Iraqi Governing Council,\r\nwelcomed and supported by the Security Council, may\r\noperate efficiently so that Iraq can fully enjoy its right\r\nto self-determination, its own sovereignty and establish\r\na democratic and representative Government,\r\ninternationally recognized and able to guarantee the\r\nconditions necessary for the country’s reconstruction.\r\nWe also hope that the United Nations may further\r\nstrengthen its active humanitarian and civil role in\r\nfavour of the Iraqi population, so as to contribute to the\r\nrebirth of that nation through democracy and\r\ndevelopment. We hope that all countries cooperating in\r\nIraq to improve security and order, under the aegis of\r\nthe United States of America, after assuring a decisive\r\ncontribution to the liberation of the country from the\r\nprevious regime, will reach an agreement with this\r\nOrganization.\r\nTo this end, the drafting of a new Security\r\nCouncil resolution, the outcome of a lively debate that\r\nis going on now, would be a major political and\r\ndiplomatic achievement. It would definitely pave the\r\nway to democracy and progress in Iraq and embody the\r\nwill of many different Governments under the aegis of\r\nthe United Nations.\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nIn line with its tradition of solidarity, and as\r\ndemonstrated in recent years through its support of\r\nhumanitarian projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina,\r\nKosovo, the Middle East and in several African\r\ncountries, often in the context of ad hoc programmes\r\nand United Nations special missions, my country will\r\nbe pleased to contribute to the reconstruction process in\r\nIraq. For the achievement of this objective, the\r\nforthcoming conference on the reconstruction of Iraq is\r\nparticularly interesting.\r\nThe tragic, painful and unforgettable events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001 have also marked the proliferation of\r\ninternational terrorism and the escalation of terrorist\r\nattacks.\r\nToday’s gathering in this important forum is a\r\nclear indication of our country’s position and its\r\nsignificance is increased by the universal character of\r\nthis meeting.\r\nThe creation of the United Nations nearly 60\r\nyears ago, at the end of Second World War, attested to\r\na unanimous desire for lasting peace and justice. I\r\nbelieve that at the beginning of the third millennium it\r\nis the responsibility of the Organization to reflect\r\neffectively the will of States to fulfil that original\r\ncommitment and keep its original spirit alive through\r\ndialogue, mediation and cooperation. Conscious of this,\r\nSan Marino reaffirms its decision to reject all forms of\r\nterrorism and to contribute fully to its defeat, as\r\ntestified to by the Republic’s accession to several\r\ninternational instruments of the United Nations and\r\nEuropean organizations.\r\nLikewise, San Marino has promptly followed up on\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and will continue\r\nto monitor terrorism at the national level, as can be noted\r\nby the implementation of the guidelines to combat the\r\nphenomenon of terrorism and its related aspects.\r\nUnfortunately, it is evident that terrorism, aside\r\nfrom being inspired by fanaticism and fundamentalism,\r\nis too often linked to underdevelopment and injustice;\r\ntheir victims can, in turn, become instruments of\r\nviolence and oppression. However, terrorism can also\r\nbe countered through the active support of international\r\ncooperation programmes to overcome disparities,\r\npoverty, discrimination, the violation of the rights of\r\nindividuals and peoples, a total absence of opportunities,\r\nand, as a result, hopelessness, in particular among the\r\nyoung, who are the future of mankind.\r\nOur collective efforts to restore favourable\r\nconditions for dialogue and mutual acceptance must\r\nnot be weakened by the growing concern of persistent,\r\nserious obstacles to the road map for peace in the\r\nMiddle East, where negotiations and agreements are\r\nbeing jeopardized by renewed terrorist attacks, hatred\r\nand retaliation. We are convinced that the Israeli and\r\nPalestinian peoples must be ensured the indisputable\r\nright to live freely in their own territory, where they\r\ncan exercise their full sovereignty in security and peace.\r\nThe success of the globalization process under\r\nway will ultimately depend on achieving peace and\r\ndevelopment for all. Within the framework of effective\r\nglobal cooperation, the role played by San Marino is\r\ninextricably linked to its tradition of freedom,\r\nindependence and democracy. Those principles, which\r\nhave characterized the Republic’s 1700 years of existence,\r\ncontinue to inspire its international policy today.\r\nIn 1854 San Marino became the first European\r\ncountry to ban the death penalty. My country believes\r\nthat this issue, which is so important and topical, must\r\nremain a top priority for the General Assembly, even\r\nthough it is not on the agenda for this session.\r\nIn the field of human rights, the ethics of\r\ndiversity requires the acceptance of the human\r\ncondition. In that spirit, San Marino has followed with\r\nspecial attention the negotiations within the working\r\ngroup for the drafting of an international convention on\r\nthe rights of persons with disabilities.\r\nSan Marino continues to pay great attention to the\r\nfollow-up given to initiatives on HIV/AIDS being\r\ncarried out by the United Nations and to the search for\r\nadequate responses so as to prevent the spread of new\r\nepidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\r\n(SARS). San Marino is also following with great\r\ninterest the work of the working group for the drafting\r\nof an international convention against the reproductive\r\ncloning of human beings, spurred by the conviction\r\nthat the cloning of human beings is an immoral and\r\ninhuman degeneration of biotechnological development\r\nand that such an abhorrent practice would be contrary\r\nto human dignity. The important ethical and moral\r\nimplications of this issue cannot be separated from\r\npurely scientific questions. We hope that the United\r\nNations will continue to strive for the protection of the\r\nfundamental rights of human beings.\r\nAdditionally, in the area of human rights, San\r\nMarino recently extended a standing invitation to the\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for\r\nHuman Rights to visit the Republic whenever\r\nnecessary in order better to carry out its mandate.\r\nI wish to recall that San Marino was the first\r\nWestern European country to ratify the Statute of the\r\nInternational Criminal Court, confident that the Court\r\nwould satisfy the widespread desire for justice and put\r\nan end to impunity for the perpetrators of the most\r\nserious crimes against the international community as a\r\nwhole. Let me also express our best wishes to the\r\nCourt, which is composed of authoritative judges, and\r\nconvey our hope that it will now be able to work in\r\naccordance with the objectives of justice, security and\r\npeace on which it is based. We are confident its work\r\nwill be fruitful and that it will always act independently\r\nand impartially.\r\nAll the objectives set out in the Millennium\r\nDeclaration could be achieved if an additional $50 billion\r\nper year were granted for development assistance, at a\r\ntime when global military expenditures total $850 billion.\r\nWe also wish to express our appreciation for the positive\r\nachievements of United Nations peacekeeping missions\r\ndeployed to many areas of the world afflicted by\r\nconflicts. Such results should encourage Governments\r\nto increase their support for those missions, which\r\npromote lasting, sustainable peace and the re-\r\nestablishment of democracy and the rule of law.\r\nSan Marino will continue to participate in joint\r\naction for the total elimination of anti-personnel mines.\r\nIn that context, San Marino urges countries that have\r\nnot yet done so to accede to the Ottawa Convention.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the International Year of\r\nthe Family in 2004 will provide further incentive to\r\nreflect on and analyse the living conditions of our\r\npopulations, paying particular attention to children, the\r\nelderly and the most vulnerable in our societies. Such\r\ngroups deserve greater consideration from society.\r\nSociety must promote effective projects for education,\r\nsolidarity and adequate support.\r\nOnly a few days ago, the United Nations\r\nCommittee on the Rights of the Child reviewed San\r\nMarino’s initial report on its implementation of the\r\nprovisions of the Convention on the Rights of the\r\nChild. The relevant measures now in force will soon be\r\nsupplemented by new ones in support of the family.\r\nIn underlining the validity of the reform\r\nprogramme started by the Secretary-General, we deem\r\nit necessary to continue efforts to reform the General\r\nAssembly, which is the most representative body of our\r\nOrganization. Indeed, the Assembly should enjoy\r\ngreater authority. We hope that agreement can also be\r\nreached on Security Council reform, and San Marino\r\nreiterates its support for the inclusion of a larger\r\nnumber of non-permanent members, in order to make\r\nthe Council more representative and democratic.\r\nLet me stress once again my country’s\r\nappreciation for and commitment to activities carried\r\nout by the United Nations in building a world of peace,\r\nsolidarity and development.\r\nIt is in that spirit that this morning I signed three\r\nimportant international instruments: the Convention on\r\nthe Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against\r\nWomen, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,\r\nrecently adopted at the fifty-sixth Assembly of the World\r\nHealth Organization and the Second Optional Protocol to\r\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political\r\nRights, aimed at abolishing the death penalty.\r\nWe need to continue our action at the international\r\nlevel despite all the difficulties and tensions that exist,\r\nbearing in mind that our joint efforts are essential to\r\nfinding a solution to the emergencies and concerns of\r\ntoday. Bringing about the necessary changes, we will\r\nbe able to reconfirm the validity of the basic principles\r\nof this Organization. We will responsibly set the\r\nconditions for our future and thus meet the\r\nexpectations of our peoples and our hearts.\r\nWhile expressing my best wishes to you, Mr\r\nPresident, to the Secretary-General and to all United\r\nNations officers, as well as to all Member States. I\r\nassure them that San Marino will be at their side in\r\nmeeting all of these challenges.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her\r\nExcellency Mrs. Soledad Alvear Valenzuela, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Chile.\r\nMrs. Alvear Valenzuela (Chile) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I congratulate Mr. Hunte on his election as\r\nPresident of this Assembly. As the Foreign Minister of\r\nSt. Lucia, a member of the Latin American and\r\nCaribbean community, he can be especially assured of\r\nthe full cooperation of the delegation of Chile.\r\nThe events of 11 September 2001, the crisis in\r\nIraq, the conflict in the Middle East and the attack on\r\nthe United Nations in Baghdad all pose enormous\r\nchallenges for the international community. Tensions\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nhave arisen over the way in which we have responded\r\nto some of these crises, but opportunities have also\r\nbeen created for joint action in new areas. We must\r\nconfront these challenges with seriousness of purpose\r\nand a collective approach.\r\nThe Secretary-General has expressed his concern\r\nat the differing perceptions of the new and old threats\r\nand the urgent need to develop a programme of\r\nsecurity aimed at building a common destiny. The\r\nUnited Nations will be what its Member States wish it\r\nto be. The success of the Organization will be the\r\nsuccess of its Members and its failure will be the\r\nresponsibility of none other than its Member States.\r\nThe United Nations can and must play a central role in\r\nbuilding a common destiny based on universally shared\r\nprinciples and values. The renewal of the United\r\nNations is therefore an urgent task that must be\r\napproached from a lofty political and ethical\r\nperspective and not from the bureaucratic standpoint\r\nthat has led to stagnation, empty rhetoric and\r\nfrustration of the desire for change.\r\nAccording to our Charter, faith in human rights is\r\na core value of every society and culture. It is essential\r\nfor us vigorously to promote its universality. We note\r\nwith concern how the progress made by mankind in\r\npromoting these values is accompanied by reversals\r\nthat frustrate the sense of ethics that we wish to impart\r\nto the global community.\r\nThe work of the United Nations must continue to\r\nbe a guarantee for the promotion and protection of\r\nhuman rights and for the strengthening of a culture that\r\nguides the conscience of each individual, each people\r\nand each nation. Democracy is consistent with the\r\npurposes and principles of this Organization.\r\nIn our region, we have made progress towards the\r\ninculcation of these values. The historic Santiago\r\nCommitment to Democracy of 1991 culminated in the\r\nadoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter and\r\nhas been complemented by the Declaration of Santiago\r\non Democracy and Public Trust: A New Commitment\r\nto Good Governance for the Americas, which was\r\nadopted at the thirty-third General Assembly of the\r\nOrganization of American States, held in Chile in June\r\nthis year. In that instrument, we reaffirmed the vital\r\nrole of multilateral cooperation in promoting\r\ndemocratic governance. This effort is an example of\r\nhow international cooperation can help to strengthen\r\nthe universal value of democracy.\r\nChile’s commitment to democracy goes beyond\r\nour region. We and other countries are part of the\r\nCommunity of Democracies, an initiative aimed at\r\npromoting and strengthening this system of coexistence\r\nthroughout the world. We hope to work in the United\r\nNations in pursuit of these objectives.\r\nInternational peace and security continue to be\r\nkey concerns of our Organization. The sacrifice of the\r\nBrazilian and Latin American Sergio Vieira de Mello,\r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General in\r\nBaghdad, and of his colleagues reaffirms our\r\ncommitment to working on behalf of peace.\r\nThe United Nations must play a more substantive\r\nrole in the future of Iraq. We must work to ensure the\r\nrapid restoration of sovereignty to the Iraqi people so\r\nthat they can freely build their future. Chile stands\r\nready to continue to work in the Security Council with\r\nan approach that will permit progress to be made\r\ntowards the consensus that is needed to improve the\r\nconditions of security and to establish a clear timetable\r\nfor political transition in that country.\r\nSecurity must guarantee people a life free from\r\nthreats. Human security thus emerges as a distinctive\r\nfeature and a prerequisite for a world without fear. We\r\nshare the ideas of the Secretary-General for the\r\nelaboration of a programme of common security that\r\nwill permit us to overcome the differences that have\r\narisen in dealing with the increasing fears of our global\r\ncommunity.\r\nGlobalization has created new opportunities for the\r\npeoples of the world, but it has also created imbalances as\r\na result of unequal access to the advantages that it offers.\r\nThe equity perspective must therefore be a key\r\ncomponent of this programme of security.\r\nDevelopment in the globalized world can no longer be\r\nsustained only in terms of technological innovation and\r\neconomic growth. Progress must be aimed at ensuring\r\nthat technological development is placed at the service\r\nof integration and collective prosperity.\r\nIn this spirit, we look forward to broad\r\nparticipation in the Global Biotechnology Forum, to be\r\nheld in the Chilean city of Concepción in March 2004,\r\nand to an outcome that will help to further strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation in one of the most dynamic\r\nfields of science and technology.\r\nOur political and economic multilateral institutions\r\nwere created in a different historical period. We must now\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\ndemonstrate our capacity to adapt them to better respond\r\nto the challenges of the twenty-first century. Our main\r\nconcern today must be how to overcome our immobility\r\nand embark upon a process of renewal. The method used\r\nthus far has not yielded the desired results. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to explore new alternatives.\r\nWe warmly welcome the initiative of the\r\nSecretary-General to establish a group of eminent\r\npersonalities to elaborate a proposal for submission to\r\nthe Organization. It is essential to address the\r\nweaknesses of the General Assembly, the Security\r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council. We\r\nmust also reflect on what new functions could be\r\nentrusted to the Trusteeship Council. We must\r\nstrengthen the dialogue between these organs and\r\nextend it to other international organizations, including\r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade\r\nOrganization and regional organizations. In order to go\r\nforward in this process of renewal, we must be able to\r\nutilize the full potential of the Charter, which has not\r\nbeen fully exploited.\r\nThe Security Council has recently gone through a\r\ncritical period. We have witnessed the difficulty it has\r\nhad in discharging the responsibilities entrusted by the\r\nCharter to this vital organ for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. We are in favour of its\r\nrevitalization, in order that an appropriate balance can\r\nbe achieved between representativity and effectiveness.\r\nReform must give consideration to the addition of\r\nnew members, both permanent and non-permanent, and\r\ninclude a review of the veto. This process can be\r\ncomplemented by mechanisms that will allow, within\r\nthe framework of the Charter, more active participation\r\nby countries that are not members of the Council.\r\nIt is also necessary more effectively to involve the\r\nprincipal organs in the consideration of issues affecting\r\ninternational peace and security. This must be done in a\r\ncoordinated manner through the effective application of\r\nthe Charter, as provided for in Article 15 thereof.\r\nIt is necessary, too, more actively to involve\r\nregional organizations and arrangements in efforts to\r\nmaintain peace and security by applying Chapter VIII\r\nof the Charter. The region of the Americas has an\r\ninstitutional structure and various coordination\r\nmechanisms that can be used to contribute to the\r\nfulfilment of the purposes of the United Nations. The\r\nexperience of the Organization of American States is\r\npertinent in this regard.\r\nThe General Assembly must undertake a process\r\nof revitalization in order to be able to play its role\r\neffectively as the principal deliberative, normative and\r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations.\r\nThe Assembly has a multiplicity of items on its\r\nagenda and has adopted many resolutions, most of\r\nwhich remain unimplemented, thereby affecting the\r\neffectiveness and credibility of the system as a whole.\r\nWe must have the political will to implement our\r\ndecisions. In short, we must strengthen the capacity of\r\nthe Assembly to assume political leadership. We must\r\nalso promote the establishment of regional agendas that\r\nfacilitate agreements and global consensus.\r\nThe United Nations must play a key role in the\r\npromotion of equitable development by increasing the\r\nOrganization’s capacity to influence the design and\r\nimplementation of national and international public\r\npolicies in the economic and social spheres.\r\nThe process of revitalization of the Economic and\r\nSocial Council must be aimed at repositioning that\r\norgan. This will require the streamlining of its agenda,\r\nmethods of work and membership, and the\r\nstrengthening of its relationship with the Security\r\nCouncil, as provided for in Article 65 of the Charter,\r\nthrough its assumption of a role in the prevention and\r\ncontainment of threats originating in social problems.\r\nWe must seek to ensure that the search for\r\nconsensus does not prevent this forum from reaching\r\nthe necessary substantive agreements required for the\r\nachievement of the purposes and principles of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nChile, from the southern part of the world, will\r\ncontinue to shoulder its responsibility to make a\r\ncontribution to the international community.\r\nThe United Nations is a unique and indispensable\r\nforum for building a world of peace and development\r\nfor all. Its core values must inspire efforts for a renewal\r\nthat will permit the Organization, in the building of our\r\ncommon destiny, to rise to the challenges of the\r\ncentury upon which we have just embarked.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His\r\nExcellency Mr. João Bernardo de Miranda, Minister for\r\nExternal Relations of Angola.\r\nMr. Miranda (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I would like\r\nto start by congratulating Mr. Julian Hunte on his\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-eight session. We wish him great success in the\r\nfulfilment of this difficult and lofty task.\r\nThe current session is taking place at one of the\r\nmost troubled times in our era. The recent events in the\r\nGulf region were a severe test of the capacity and\r\nreadiness of the United Nations to provide appropriate\r\nresponses to the challenges presently faced by the\r\ninternational community. The impact of these events\r\nsomehow diminished the cohesion of our world\r\nOrganization and weakened trust among its Members.\r\nThere was a failure in the international security system,\r\nwhich puts us in the position of needing immediately to\r\nmake it more effective.\r\nIn fact, the present international security system,\r\ncreated after the last great war — despite having to\r\ndate prevented the outbreak of a new world conflict —\r\nhas shown signs of an incompatibility in the global\r\ncollective security interests of the Members of the\r\nUnited Nations in relation to the new challenges of this\r\nmillennium.\r\nWe are in urgent need of an integrated system\r\ncapable of dealing effectively with the major threats to\r\ninternational stability at the outset of this twenty-first\r\ncentury, specifically terrorism and international\r\norganized crime; weapons of mass destruction; internal\r\nconflicts, which, unfortunately, continue to plague the\r\nAfrican continent in particular; generalized poverty;\r\nand HIV/AIDS.\r\nTerrorism is today the most direct threat to the\r\nsecurity of our countries, as can be seen from the attacks\r\nthat in the past two years have killed thousands of\r\ncivilians in the United States, Russia, Africa and Asia.\r\nWith regard to armed conflicts, the situation\r\ncontinues to require urgent attention. During the last\r\ndecade, approximately one third of African States were\r\neither directly or indirectly affected by internal conflicts,\r\nwhich resulted in costs as high as $15 billion a year, and\r\ncaused hundreds of thousands of deaths, massive\r\ndisplacements of people, famine and malnutrition, and\r\nthe spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe prevalence of conflicts in Africa is not only\r\nthe result of the divisions inherited from the post-\r\ncolonial period and the cold war and of ethnic and\r\nreligious differences. It is also a consequence of factors\r\nsuch as the fragility of national institutions, the\r\nmarginalization of the African continent from the\r\nworld economy, the illegal exploitation of natural\r\nresources and the resulting arms proliferation, and the\r\nweak monitoring of national borders. This situation\r\nmust be swiftly reversed, since it can endanger the\r\nfuture of millions of Africans and increase the risk of\r\ncertain areas of the continent’s becoming true\r\nsanctuaries for terrorist organizations.\r\nImproving United Nations political institutions\r\nand security systems constitutes the most effective\r\nmethod of addressing the threats facing humankind. It\r\nis therefore necessary to establish new mechanisms\r\noutside of the traditional strategic doctrines. The\r\ninternational legal documents created by the United\r\nNations, and the current alliances between States, have\r\nproved insufficient to respond adequately and in a\r\nconsensual manner to such threats, particularly when they\r\nare posed by entities that are not themselves States.\r\nBecause of its universal nature, the United\r\nNations plays a central role in the management of\r\ncurrent and future challenges. But that is not enough. It\r\nis crucial that that role be performed within a more\r\ndemocratic and participative framework, particularly\r\nwith regard to major decisions on international peace\r\nand security.\r\nIraq and other parts of the Middle East are the\r\nmain hotbeds of tension in the world today, and the\r\ncombined efforts of the United Nations are being\r\nfocused on that region. The continued loss of life in\r\nIraq — with most of those killed being innocent\r\ncivilians, including United Nations officials, among\r\nthem the late Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Sergio Vieira de Mello — is a reminder of the\r\nneed for increased support by the international\r\ncommunity to ensure the security of the Iraqi people,\r\nthe building of new institutions and the beginning of\r\nthe reconstruction of the country.\r\nThe will of the international community, and\r\ncertainly that of the Iraqi people, is for Iraq to become,\r\nas soon as possible, a viable, democratic State with\r\ninstitutions validated by its people, and a country living\r\nin peace with its neighbours.\r\nThe achievement of this goal implies the\r\nestablishment of a political and institutional framework\r\nin which the United Nations plays an active role,\r\nspecifically in the pacification and unification of the\r\ncountry; in the internal political dialogue; in the\r\nprocess of national reconciliation; and in the\r\nestablishment of new democratic institutions.\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nAngola hopes that the present convergence of\r\npositions among the members of the Security Council\r\non the role of the United Nations in Iraq will facilitate\r\nan understanding relative to the transitional process in\r\ngeneral and to the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nAngola deplores the loss of civilian life and the\r\nmaterial damage caused by the escalation of the\r\nconflict in the Middle East. The rekindling of violence\r\nbetween Palestinians and Israelis represents the\r\ngreatest danger to the implementation of the road map\r\nfor peace, whose ultimate objective is the signing of an\r\nagreement for the creation of an independent, viable\r\nPalestinian State, living side by side and in peace with\r\nIsrael and its other neighbours. In our view, that is the\r\nonly solution capable of putting a definite end to the\r\ncycle of violence.\r\nThe end, last year, of the armed conflict in\r\nAngola, and the success of the peace process, are\r\namong the most extraordinary political achievements\r\nseen in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. With the\r\nattainment of peace in Angola, the Southern African\r\nregion became, for the first time in several decades, a\r\nzone free from conflict, and it can now focus its human\r\nand material resources on reconstruction and\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nAngola today is a country in its post-conflict\r\nstage. It is committed to the tasks of overcoming the\r\nheavy burden of a 40-year conflict, focusing on the\r\nstrengthening of its democratic process — which even\r\nduring the difficult war period was never abandoned by\r\nthe Government — and fully resuming its legitimate\r\nrole within the regional and international context.\r\nAs a result of the impact of the conflict on the\r\nhuman, economic, social and financial structures of the\r\ncountry, and given the inequities inherited from our\r\ncolonial past, the current post-conflict stage — which\r\nwill lead to the building of a new society in Angola —\r\nis a difficult and painful one, and this has been an\r\nobvious impediment to an immediate response to the\r\nlegitimate aspirations of Angolan citizens.\r\nThe challenges that confront Angola are enormous\r\n— perhaps immeasurable. The main challenges include\r\nthe resettlement of more than 4 million displaced\r\npersons and 450,000 refugees; the social reintegration\r\nof more than 80,000 former military personnel and\r\ntheir respective families; the resolution of the problem\r\nof absolute poverty, which now afflicts more than half\r\nof the Angolan population; and the reconstruction of\r\nthe social and economic infrastructure.\r\nAt the same time, in spite of the scarcity of\r\navailable resources, we are creating the necessary\r\nconditions to hold elections in the near future. Despite\r\nour numerous problems and challenges, there is hardly\r\nany assistance from the international community for\r\nAngola, as compared with other countries in similar\r\ncircumstances, some of which received an immediate\r\nresponse to their appeals, even though they lacked de\r\njure institutions. We would like to believe that such\r\ntreatment is not the result of any form of discrimination\r\nagainst our country.\r\nThere is no example in modern history of a State,\r\nrich or poor, that, in the aftermath of a devastating and\r\ndestructive war such as that which afflicted Angola,\r\nhas managed to overcome the burden left by such a war\r\nand rise again without outside assistance. In Angola,\r\nthis reconstruction effort has, up to now, been borne\r\nsolely by the Angolans themselves, in spite of the\r\nreiterated promises that the only factor that hindered\r\nthe supply of aid to our reconstruction was the\r\npacification of our country.\r\nWe hereby renew, therefore, our appeal to the\r\ninternational community to help Angola in its domestic\r\nreconstruction effort. To this end, my delegation will\r\nsubmit a draft resolution on international assistance\r\nand the reconstruction and economic development of\r\nAngola, which proposes that an international donor\r\nconference be convened. We are counting on the\r\nsupport of the Assembly.\r\nAngola also welcomes the progress made in the\r\narea of peace and security in other regions of the\r\ncontinent, especially the Democratic Republic of\r\nCongo. The role of Angola, as well as that of its\r\npartners, was crucial in preventing a situation of chaos\r\nand disintegration in the territory of that brotherly\r\ncountry, with which we share a long border, and in\r\nconvincing the parties to give up war and choose\r\ninstead a negotiated political solution.\r\nThe Congolese patriots have shown signs of great\r\nmaturity in guaranteeing the success of the peace process\r\nand the transformation of the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo into a viable country that does not constitute a\r\nthreat to the stability of its border regions.\r\nAngola will continue to be open to strengthening\r\nthe traditional relations of friendship and cooperation it\r\n35\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nhas maintained with the authorities of the interim\r\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nas well as with future authorities that are legitimately\r\nelected by popular vote.\r\nThere is still a stalemate with regard to the\r\nsituation in the Western Sahara. Difficulties regarding\r\nthe holding of a referendum on the self-determination\r\nof the territory are a hindrance to the search for a\r\ndefinitive solution to this question. Angola urges the\r\nparties involved to show flexibility and seek a political\r\nsolution that enables the people of that territory to\r\ndecide freely about their own destiny.\r\nToday, as one part of the world, particularly the\r\nindustrialized countries, enjoys considerable wealth, 40\r\nper cent of the 600 million Africans continue to survive\r\non less than one dollar a day. In fact, Africa continues\r\nto show the lowest social and economic development\r\nindicators, and those levels are becoming even worse, due\r\nto the marginalization of the African countries in the\r\nprogress of globalization and within the world economy,\r\nwhere trade and capital share are only 1 per cent.\r\nAfrica is also the continent that benefits the least\r\nin terms of foreign direct investment, receiving only 7\r\nper cent of the investment targeted at the developing\r\ncountries. External debt has been a huge obstacle to the\r\ndevelopment process because repayment of the debt\r\nservice alone has depleted the already-limited national\r\nresources of the African States. Angola supports the\r\ncancellation of the external debt service of the least\r\ndeveloped countries, particularly those in the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nThe macroeconomic measures imposed by the\r\nBretton Woods institutions within the framework of the\r\nstructural adjustment programme have not always been\r\nable to help the African continent overcome its\r\ninternational economic problems. In many cases, that\r\nhas led to controversial results. Based on such results,\r\nexperience has shown that, in fact, the financial\r\ninstitutions very often do not take into account the\r\nidiosyncrasies of each country and frequently put the\r\nGovernments in the position of choosing between\r\nmeeting the conditions imposed by the financial\r\ninstitutions or meeting the real needs of their people.\r\nAngola hopes that, with the establishment of the\r\nAfrican Union and the launching of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, the tragic\r\nsituation in which the African continent finds itself\r\ntoday can be alleviated by setting priorities and giving\r\nspecial attention to immediate economic development\r\nissues.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Mr. Roy\r\nChaderton-Matos, Minister for Foreign Affairs of\r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Chaderton-Matos (Venezuela) (spoke in\r\nSpanish): I begin this speech with mixed emotions —\r\nhappiness over the election of our friend Julian Hunte\r\n— Minister of our sister country in the Caribbean,\r\nSaint Lucia — as President of this body; and pain,\r\nbecause our United Nations lost one of its best people,\r\nas did Brazil, an exemplary member of one of the\r\nworld’s soundest diplomatic systems. Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello died for peace and human rights, causes that\r\nilluminated his life as a diplomat and a Brazilian.\r\nThere are other unfortunate examples from other\r\ntimes. We lost Anna Lindh, Swedish Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and daughter of the one of the countries most\r\nclosely linked to social justice, who was educated in\r\nthe Nordic tradition of social advancement and\r\ncommitment to peace and democracy. Years earlier,\r\nanother Swede — Olaf Palme — died, a man of peace and\r\ngood will, to whom the international community bade\r\nfarewell with the song of Chilean Violeta Parra, Gracias a\r\nla vida, as a tribute to his struggles on behalf of the\r\npersecuted, the disenfranchised and the impoverished.\r\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, while on a peace\r\nmission, United Nations Secretary-General Dag\r\nHammarskjöld, also from Sweden, died in what was\r\napparently an accident, amid the tangled, political\r\nturbulence in a Congo assailed by its enemies at home,\r\nas well as international factors that were depriving its\r\nsovereign leadership of vital oxygen. Still earlier,\r\nCount Folke Bernadotte — also Swedish — was a\r\nvictim of terrorism while on a peace mission for the\r\nUnited Nations in Jerusalem. Even before that, at the\r\nend of the Second World War, Swedish diplomat Raoul\r\nWallenberg, who, from Budapest, opened the way to\r\nfreedom for Jews who were being persecuted by Nazi\r\nbarbarity, disappeared without a trace.\r\nIt seems that nothing has changed. Social\r\ninjustice goes on forever. Conflicts repeat themselves.\r\nThe protagonists of historic change are physically\r\neliminated or morally destroyed. The advocacy of\r\nviolence is dragging us towards terrorism and war.\r\nInspired by the values of social justice,\r\ndemocracy and peace, on behalf of the President of the\r\n36\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez Frías,\r\nI wish to reaffirm our support for the United Nations\r\nfrom a position that is critical yet unambiguous and\r\ntotally consistent with its loftiest goals. These same\r\nvalues inspire us in Venezuela, a country that prided\r\nitself on being the richest and most democratic nation in\r\nLatin America, but that squandered its privileged\r\nhistorical opportunities and fell into a process of ethnical\r\nand social decay that has brought us close to the abyss.\r\nAs a result, we had to assume a profound process of\r\ntransformation towards peace and democracy.\r\nThe sectors affected by the democratic\r\ntransformation have resorted to force to frustrate this\r\ncommitment of the majority. They have resorted to\r\nmilitary coup, oil sabotage, financial panic and media\r\nterrorism. Thank God that they failed, but they still\r\ncaused much damage.\r\nThe provisions of a Constitution approved by the\r\npeople in a referendum that expands the basis of\r\ndemocracy in a social State founded on law, and which\r\nis truly our country plan for all, have generated violent\r\nand anti-democratic opposition. Opening the way to\r\nparticipatory democracy and to an economy that is free,\r\nyet not anarchic, and that protects private freedoms\r\nwithout bowing to the almighty market, has stirred up\r\nthe most egoistic and insensitive sector of our country\r\nand of the international community — the neoliberals.\r\nOn this subject, His Holiness Pope Paul VI, in his\r\nencyclical Populorum Progressio, of March 1967, said\r\n“This unchecked liberalism leads to dictatorship\r\nrightly denounced by Pius XI as producing ‘the\r\ninternational imperialism of money’. One cannot\r\ncondemn such abuses too strongly by solemnly\r\nrecalling once again that the economy is at the\r\nservice of man.”\r\nEntrepreneurs who took no risks, protected by a\r\ncolluding Government under a captive market, who did\r\nnot compete and who evaded taxation promoted a\r\nconspiracy against the legitimate Government of\r\nVenezuela, allied with international sectors that had\r\nbeen past beneficiaries.\r\nNow, therefore, our democracy, threatened\r\nunsuccessfully by certain Venezuelan media magnates,\r\ninvites members of the international community to see\r\nfor themselves in Venezuela the strength of our society\r\nand the immense civil liberties available in our country,\r\nincluding the broadest freedom of expression in our\r\nentire hemisphere. We will welcome witnesses to come\r\nto Venezuela and watch our television, read our\r\nnewspapers, interview the owners of the private media,\r\nlisten to commentators and news anchors, and draw\r\ntheir own conclusions. We need them to familiarize\r\nthemselves with the most hidden threat against\r\ndemocracy: the media dictatorship, a mirror of the\r\nculture of violence and mediocrity.\r\nOur process of social change in peace and\r\ndemocracy was interrupted by an assault against\r\nlegality by the media and their hypnotized followers. In\r\nscarcely three days, during their ephemeral de facto\r\nGovernment, all democratic institutions were\r\nabolished, before people and soldiers in the streets\r\nrestored normalcy. Today, we aspire to peace and\r\nreconciliation among Venezuelans. In our democracy,\r\nthere is room and hope for everyone.\r\nWe want also peace for our sister Colombia and\r\nin Northern Ireland, in the Balkans, between Jews and\r\nPalestinians and throughout the world. Peace is also the\r\naspiration of the Members of the United Nations, but\r\nthere will not be lasting peace without social justice; there\r\nwill not be stable democracies without social justice; and\r\nfreedom will be a fraud without social justice.\r\nWe congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, on his balanced and firm guidance of the\r\nOrganization at the very difficult time that the world is\r\npassing through and on his wise and heartfelt message\r\nto this democratic Assembly.\r\nThis year, our activities in the General Assembly are\r\noverclouded by the attack on the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad, where so many faithful servants\r\nof the Organization lost their lives, by the aftermath of\r\nthe war and the tense situation existing in the Middle East\r\nand by the alarming world poverty indices, a scenario that\r\nleads us to profound reflection and demands that we\r\nstrengthen the Organization’s capacity to respond.\r\nVenezuela’s action has been aimed at restoring\r\nand promoting multilateralism as a means and a\r\nblueprint for the shaping of a more democratic world.\r\nUnilateralism is monochromatic, worn out, oppressive\r\nand authoritarian; multilateralism is polychromatic,\r\nanimated, tolerant and democratic. In that conviction, we\r\nassumed the responsibility of chairing the Group of 77\r\nlast year and the Group of 15, whose summit meeting we\r\nwill hold next year in my country. There are mechanisms\r\nthrough which the developing world is expressing its\r\nmultilateral voice and its aspirations to the universal\r\ncommon good and to international social justice.\r\n37\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nHistorical developments since 1945 require that\r\nwe have a more democratic and more representative\r\nSecurity Council. We must strengthen the General\r\nAssembly given its democratic and participatory nature.\r\nWe want the Economic and Social Council to be the\r\npowerful organ that it has not been allowed to be.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations cannot be\r\ntailored to suit unilateral conveniences. War is not a\r\nromantic adventure that brings us to a happy ending in\r\nwhich the superheroes defeat the villains. Sometimes,\r\nwar turns into a death trap that causes harsher suffering\r\nthan the suffering that, in theory, it intends to alleviate.\r\nSometimes, it brings other wars, more violence and\r\nmore terrorism.\r\nUse of force by the State should not be\r\nundertaken at the discretion of those who happen to be\r\ninterested at the time. The responsibility of the\r\nOrganization’s Members is collective, as the\r\ninternational security that we want to protect and\r\nguarantee must be. We all desire a better world for\r\nfuture generations, and why not for ourselves? We are\r\nall protagonists in this world drama; hegemonies\r\nappear archaic and authoritarian. Our objective is a\r\nstrengthened, universal and democratic Organization.\r\nA year ago in this Hall, we condemned the\r\nabominable terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, in\r\nwhich we lost thousands of citizens of the United\r\nStates and of other countries. That sudden holocaust\r\nwas perhaps the product of religious fundamentalism,\r\nbut it is unjust to single out the believers of one faith\r\nfor acts of extremist minorities when other minorities\r\nof believers have also committed crimes against\r\nhumanity in the name of the Lord. Terrorism destroys\r\nhuman lives, both of innocents and of combatants; it\r\ntorments family members, friends and peoples. There is\r\nno good terrorism, not in the name of an ethnicity or of\r\na nationality; not in the name of justice or of freedom;\r\nnot in the name of God.\r\nFour days ago, on behalf of the Bolivarian\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, I deposited the ratification\r\ninstruments of the International Convention for the\r\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings, the International\r\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\r\nTerrorism and the Optional Protocol to the Convention\r\non the Rights of the Child on the involvement of\r\nchildren in armed conflicts. Yesterday, the Venezuelan\r\nParliament made the Inter-American Convention\r\nagainst Terrorism a law of the Republic. We hope that\r\nthe ratification procedure will be completed within the\r\nOrganization of American States as soon as possible.\r\nNevertheless, we must continue the frontal assault\r\non the most widespread and destructive forms of\r\nterrorism: poverty and social exclusion. The developing\r\nworld is suffering from hunger, poverty and exclusion\r\ncaused by an unjust economic system enveloped in the\r\npractices of savage neo-liberalism and in the globalized\r\neconomy with an unfair scheme of commercial trade\r\nthat generates unemployment, exploitation, inequality\r\nand resentment. It is a system that attacks the dignity of\r\nthe human person. Its leaders are not accustomed to\r\nspeaking of social justice in their statements.\r\nOne initiative that the President of Venezuela has\r\nundertaken to fight poverty is the creation of an\r\ninternational humanitarian fund that we proposed at the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development,\r\nheld at Monterrey; at the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, held at Johannesburg; and once again in\r\nthe General Assembly. The fund is designed to be a\r\nconsistent and innovative source for financing non-\r\nrefundable resources coming from the reduction of\r\nmilitary expenditures and money confiscated as a result\r\nof narco-trafficking and corruption. It will be an\r\neffective formula of international assistance to generate\r\nopportunities for economic and social progress in\r\ncountries excluded from traditional financing schemes.\r\nConverging proposals make us optimistic in the light of\r\nthis type of initiative.\r\nI conclude with a quotation from His Holiness\r\nJohn Paul II in 1994:\r\n“The world longs for peace and has a\r\ndesperate need of peace. Yet wars, conflicts,\r\nincreasing violence and situations of social unrest\r\nand endemic poverty continue to reap innocent\r\nvictims and to cause divisions between\r\nindividuals and peoples. At times peace appears a\r\ntruly unattainable goal! In a climate made cold by\r\nindifference and occasionally poisoned by hatred,\r\nhow can one hope for the dawn of an era of\r\npeace, which only feelings of solidarity and of\r\nlove can usher in?”\r\nThat is how all Members of the Organization should\r\nconcentrate our efforts to find the necessary means that\r\nwill enable us to ensure peace and democracy at home\r\nand in the international community, availing ourselves\r\nof the best antidote to violence: social justice.\r\n38\r\nA/58/PV.14\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last\r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nHowever, one representative has requested to exercise\r\nthe right of reply. May I remind members that\r\nstatements made in the exercise of the right of reply are\r\nlimited to ten minutes for the first intervention and to\r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be\r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Najafi (Islamic Republic of Iran): This\r\nafternoon the Foreign Minister of the United Arab\r\nEmirates raised some unacceptable claims against the\r\nterritorial integrity of my country. Since we have clearly\r\nand repeatedly put on record our position on this issue on\r\nprevious occasions, I need not go into details.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is fully committed\r\nto its international obligations, especially those arising\r\nfrom the agreement of 1971. We firmly believe that\r\nmisunderstandings over its interpretation or\r\nimplementation, if any, should be addressed with good\r\nwill through mutually agreed mechanisms in order to\r\nfind an amicable solution.\r\nMeanwhile, my Government has always\r\nwelcomed the interaction and exchange of views\r\nbetween Iranian and United Arab Emirates officials on\r\nissues of interest and concern to both countries. In that\r\nrespect, we are pleased that talks have continued, talks\r\nin which the two parties can discuss bilateral and\r\nregional issues and take a number of positive steps to\r\naddress them. We believe that dialogue between our\r\ntwo Governments can play a determining role in\r\nremoving any existing misunderstandings.\r\nMr. Al-Shamsi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in\r\nArabic): On behalf of my delegation, I would like to\r\nexpress our disappointment at the statement made by\r\nthe representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran with\r\nrespect to the three occupied islands, Greater and\r\nLesser Tunbs and Abu Musa. The United Arab\r\nEmirates deeply regrets the continued false claims\r\nmade by the Islamic Republic of Iran in order to\r\nchange the legal, political and historical status quo of\r\nthose three islands since their occupation by the\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran in 1971. We consider that\r\nunbalanced policy of the Iranian Government to be a\r\nclear violation of the principles of the United Nations\r\nCharter, provisions of international law and the bases\r\non which good-neighbourly relations are conducted.\r\nWe ask ourselves why the Islamic Republic of\r\nIran has refused over the past years to respond\r\npositively to the peaceful initiatives taken by my\r\ncountry, which has called for serious and direct\r\nbilateral negotiations to guarantee the just settlement of\r\nthis issue, or to remit the case to the International\r\nCourt of Justice. We have repeatedly declared that we\r\nare ready to accept any legal ruling or opinion issued\r\nby the International Court of Justice. We consider\r\nIran’s rejection of such a step to be a result of the\r\nweakness of the legal and political arguments it\r\nemploys to perpetuate its continued illegal occupation\r\nof our three islands.\r\nMy country possesses legal, historic and\r\ndemographic proof of our national sovereignty over\r\nthese islands. Once again, we hope that the\r\nGovernment of the Islamic Republic of Iran will\r\nreconsider its policy and seriously take up my\r\ncountry’s reasonable and wise proposal for a just,\r\nequitable and comprehensive settlement of this issue,\r\nrestoring the three islands to the United Arab Emirates.\r\nIf that were done, it would foster relations of good-\r\nneighbourliness and cooperation between our two\r\npeoples and countries and strengthen peace, security,\r\nstability and progress in the entire region.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n"
