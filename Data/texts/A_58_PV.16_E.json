Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Most Honourable Percival\r\nJames Patterson, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Defence of Jamaica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Defence\r\nfor Jamaica.\r\nMr. Percival James Patterson, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Defence of Jamaica, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Most Honourable\r\nPercival James Patterson, Prime Minister and Minister\r\nfor Defence of Jamaica, and inviting him to address the\r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Patterson (Jamaica): Your election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession, Sir, is a source of great pride and considerable\r\nsatisfaction to Jamaica and the entire Caribbean. We\r\nregard it as a tangible acknowledgement of the region’s\r\nactive engagement on the global stage. I am confident\r\nthat your combination of long political experience,\r\noutstanding diplomatic skills and commitment to\r\nglobal comity will enable all of us to benefit from your\r\nguiding hand at a time when the United Nations, the\r\nvery cornerstone of global security and economic\r\ncooperation, faces its most severe test and the Charter\r\nitself is exposed to its greatest challenge. We also wish\r\nto commend the Secretary-General for his work during\r\na very difficult year and in trying circumstances for the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIt may eventually prove to be a fortunate quirk of\r\nhistory that, by virtue of the rotation system, a\r\ndistinguished representative of the Caribbean now\r\noccupies the presidency. For, by virtue of our history,\r\nlocation and size, we who fashioned the Caribbean\r\nCommunity thirty years ago recognized that we would\r\nnever be able to acquire the economic power or\r\nmilitary might to stand alone. Multilateralism,\r\ntherefore, affords us our only source of protection.\r\nTherefore, from its inception, our Community has\r\nremained resolute in upholding the sovereign equality\r\nof States and the maintenance of an international order\r\nthat protects the weak and powerless from domination.\r\nThe international situation today is filled with\r\nuncertainty and fear. There is a prevailing climate of\r\ndistrust and insecurity. Humankind faces the dangers of\r\nterrorism, nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. We witness outbreaks of war and violence\r\nand a worrying escalation of confrontation and conflict.\r\nThere are new doctrines and policies that threaten\r\npeace everywhere.\r\nThe pillars of international law and respect for\r\nsovereign rights are being steadily eroded. Injustice\r\nand abuses of human rights still remain manifest. These\r\nare real concerns that underscore the need to strengthen\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nmultilateralism, to restore confidence in the United\r\nNations system, to buttress its centrality in decisions\r\nthat affect us all and to thereby enhance its capacity to\r\nenforce.\r\nThe multilateral process will collapse unless the\r\ninternational community asserts a strong collective will\r\nto review the structures, mandates and procedures in\r\nour global system.\r\nIn relation to efforts to strengthen multilateralism,\r\nI wish to emphasize four requirements:\r\nFirst, multilateralism must be equitable. This is\r\ncritical for its credibility. It should promote policies\r\nthat provide full opportunity for all States to benefit\r\nfrom the global system and that take into account the\r\nneeds, aspirations and welfare of the entire global\r\ncommunity. It should be non-discriminatory and\r\nproceed from the principle that the lives of human\r\nbeings cannot be differentiated on the basis of race,\r\nnationality or religion.\r\nSecondly, multilateralism must be democratic.\r\nThis is critical for its acceptability. Its decision-making\r\nshould be based on a fully inclusive process, in which\r\nall States have a voice and where dialogue and equal\r\nparticipation are encouraged and promoted.\r\nThirdly, multilateralism must be principled. This\r\nis critical for its legitimacy. It must be based on\r\ncommon rules and standards devised and enforced by\r\nthe international community, standards without\r\nselective application or double standards.\r\nFourthly, multilateralism must be effective. This\r\nis critical for its efficiency. Decisions, once taken,\r\nshould be implemented. Member States must exercise\r\nthe political will to guarantee that policies and\r\ndecisions that are agreed upon and taken are supported\r\nand upheld.\r\nAdequate resources must also be provided where\r\nnecessary. In order to promote the interests of all\r\nStates, the United Nations and multilateral institutions\r\nmust facilitate the creation of new opportunities for\r\neconomic development, through the expansion of trade\r\nand investment flows and through technical\r\ncooperation assistance.\r\nIn order to strengthen multilateralism, we need\r\nreform and rebuilding to improve the work of the\r\nUnited Nations in areas such as development\r\ncooperation, humanitarian affairs and disarmament.\r\nNo one, not even the five permanent members,\r\ndares to dispute the compelling urgency of altering the\r\ndesign and function of the Security Council if it is to\r\nfulfil, in the realities of the world today, the mandate\r\nconferred by the Charter of 1945. The case for\r\nexpansion of membership is irrefutable, as is the need\r\nto redesign decision-making to correspond with the\r\nprinciple of the sovereign equality of States.\r\nLet me make it clear: reform must extend beyond\r\ncomposition and geographical balance. The Security\r\nCouncil, as presently constituted, makes no pretence at\r\nrepresenting democracy in the global system. This must\r\nbe changed if we are to not fall into a dangerous abyss,\r\nand it must be changed in a way that deters arrogant\r\ndeviation from the most basic elements of the rule of\r\ninternational law. We have been talking for long\r\nenough; the time has come to cut the talk and walk the\r\nwalk.\r\nIn 2001, from this podium, I called for a United\r\nNations renaissance. Unless we undertake it now, only\r\nthose who believe in a resurrection will still be present.\r\nNone of us will then be able pretend that we are not\r\nresponsible for the demise of the Organization, nor will\r\nwe be able to exonerate ourselves from the\r\ncondemnation of history.\r\nWith regard to the General Assembly, what is\r\nneeded is a resuscitation in the use of its powers and\r\nassertion of its role as the principal organ of the United\r\nNations. This Assembly is a forum of equals. Its\r\npronouncements and policy decisions must carry the\r\nstamp of legitimacy as it is the voice of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nBut while we emphasize the importance of\r\ninstitutional reform, there should be equal focus on the\r\nresponsibilities of membership. There is need for a\r\nrevitalization in the commitment and political will of\r\nMember States to support the multilateral system and\r\nprovide it with adequate resources. Irrespective of the\r\ninstitutional arrangements we may devise, it is, in the\r\nfinal analysis, the Member States alone who can make\r\nthe system work. We cannot afford to fail.\r\nThe critical problems facing us concerning war\r\nand peace are compounded by the proliferation of\r\nweapons of all kinds. Globally, military expenditures\r\nnow amount to over 800 billion dollars annually.\r\nExperience has shown, however, that military power\r\nand massive investment in weapons do not bring\r\nsecurity and lasting peace. The force of arms cannot\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nimpose a lasting peace. Instead, it breeds a climate of\r\ninsecurity and feeds violence, war and terrorism with\r\nincreasingly destructive capacity.\r\nAt the same time, the arms industry fuels a\r\nrapidly growing underworld of trans-national organized\r\ncrime, which jeopardizes law and order and impedes\r\neconomic growth and social stability within our\r\nnational boundaries.\r\nIt is tragic and painful to witness the continued\r\ncycle of violence and carnage and the massive\r\ndestruction of property in the Middle East. No solution\r\ncan result from the continued military subjugation of\r\nthe Palestinians or from violence against the Israelis. A\r\npolitical settlement has to be found to provide security\r\nfor the Israeli people, to establish an independent State\r\nfor the Palestinians and to make suitable arrangements\r\nfor the security of all States in the region.\r\nWe cannot begin to speak about the situation in\r\nIraq without noting the atmosphere of fear, disorder\r\nand insecurity which now prevails in that country. We\r\ndeplore the recent bombings of the Jordanian Embassy\r\nin Baghdad and the United Nations office, which\r\nresulted in the deaths of United Nations officials,\r\nincluding that of the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General in Iraq, and the bombing of the\r\nShi’ite mosque.\r\nWe must all learn from what has happened in Iraq\r\nover the past year. The immediate question is how to\r\nformulate interim arrangements for the recovery and\r\nreconstruction of that country and the restoration of its\r\nsovereignty and independence, under a Government\r\nchosen by the Iraqi people. Efforts to re-engage the\r\nUnited Nations must ensure that it assumes a\r\nmeaningful role in the peace-building process and the\r\ntransition to democracy.\r\nThe situation in Africa has not been given the\r\nlevel of attention that is needed, particularly by the\r\nSecurity Council. The continued turmoil within parts of\r\nthe continent shows the need for stabilization through\r\nconciliation and dialogue between contending parties\r\nto end further fighting and bloodshed. We commend\r\nthe role being played by regional organizations like the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS) and by African statesmen to mediate and\r\nbring peace to those areas of current concern. But more\r\nshould be done.\r\nAdditional resources are needed to assist to\r\nensure that societies disrupted by conflict can be re-\r\nestablished and stabilized. The obstacles to eliminating\r\npoverty and disease can be overcome by providing\r\nmaterial assistance, and we are convinced that Africa\r\nhas the indigenous resources, the human potential and\r\nthe leadership to prevail over adversity.\r\nWithin the global economy, the pattern continues\r\nof a widening gap between developed and developing\r\ncountries. Wealth is increasing but poverty is also\r\ngrowing in critical areas of the world. Although we\r\ncontinue to raise our voices to warn of the dangers of\r\nthis global trend, our partners in the developed world\r\nhave given little indication of a change in policies that\r\nmight reverse it. We are continually told that prosperity\r\nwill come with policies of liberalization, a minimalist\r\nState and deregulation. In turn, these policies will\r\nunleash free enterprise to take advantage of economic\r\nopportunities that will lead to development and growth.\r\nBut it has become painfully obvious that this model\r\ndoes not succeed everywhere, particularly in the\r\ndeveloping world.\r\nAs you know so well, Sir, the countries of the\r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) have for a long\r\ntime been a region where democracy flourishes and the\r\nrule of law prevails. The strengthening of civil and\r\npolitical rights in our countries has been our passion\r\nsince we gained our freedom.\r\nWe know that no country is above improvement\r\nin any of these areas, but there is a fashion in the\r\nindustrial world — including countries that are new\r\nconverts to these values — to imply that their adoption\r\nis the solution to all the problems of development.\r\nWere that so, Jamaica and all our countries of the\r\nCaribbean would have been havens of prosperity long\r\nago.\r\nWhat much of the developing world needs goes\r\nbeyond sermons about the precepts of democracy,\r\nabout obeying the rule of law and securing respect for\r\nhuman rights. The help we need is help in preserving\r\nthose rights from erosion by the instabilities that derive\r\nfrom underdevelopment and from the steady\r\ndeterioration in the global political environment.\r\nIn the international community, those same values\r\nare being systematically discarded and destroyed, as if\r\nour world society deserves less than our national\r\ncommunities. The persistence of underdevelopment —\r\nthe denial of people’s full rights as human beings — is\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nthe major challenge that poor countries face. We make\r\nthis clear, because it has become all too easy for rich\r\ncountries to excuse themselves from any meaningful\r\neffort towards poverty alleviation and economic\r\ndevelopment by asserting that salvation lies simply in\r\nsecuring civil and political rights. This is exactly what\r\nthey did at Cancun to the poorest countries in the\r\nworld — to those who live in abject poverty — by\r\ndenying their plaintive petition for a better deal in\r\ncotton.\r\nAs the current Chairman of the Caribbean\r\nCommunity, I assert that for us in the Caribbean, the\r\nfuture of our democracies lies in the strengthening of\r\nour economies, in a more favourable trading\r\nenvironment for our products, in more rapid and\r\neffective debt relief, in the protection of legitimate\r\nareas of economic progress like our financial services\r\nindustry and in tailoring globalization and the dogma\r\nof liberalization to the needs of small economies. Our\r\nfuture lies, in short, in escaping the trap of poverty.\r\nThat some are poorer does not make us less poor than\r\nwe are; that some are less developed than we are does\r\nnot alter our state of underdevelopment.\r\nTrade and competitiveness are not everything. In\r\ndeveloping countries there are weaknesses in\r\nproduction capacity and deficiencies at the micro level\r\nthat can be helped through programmes of development\r\ncooperation. Regrettably, in recent years, donor\r\nresources for such cooperation have been shrinking.\r\nWhere commitments have been given, there have just\r\nbeen too many promises broken. But we still remain\r\nhopeful that the pledges of Monterrey and the targets of\r\nJohannesburg will be taken seriously as commitments\r\nto be implemented.\r\nPartnership should not be used as a vehicle for\r\nthe imposition of conditionalities to promote bilateral\r\npolitical objectives. In our view, true partnership must\r\nrespect the concept of ownership by recipients and the\r\nnational priorities as determined by them. Decisions\r\naffecting development are being taken in different\r\nareas, in different forums and by different agencies.\r\nIncreasingly, there is the need to ensure coherence in\r\npolicies and programmes.\r\nThe international system currently does not have\r\nan effective mechanism for conducting such an\r\nexercise. We reiterate our belief that one of the urgent\r\ntasks of the moment is to create a mechanism within\r\nthe international architecture, which will focus on\r\ntrade, finance, technology and development policy in\r\nan integrated manner.\r\nWe want to draw attention to the Barbados\r\nProgramme of Action, which deals with the\r\nvulnerability of small island developing States (SIDS).\r\nWe call on the donor community to support the review\r\nof international economic arrangements, when the\r\ninternational conference meets in 2004 to review the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action.\r\nWe in Jamaica fully recognize that globalization\r\nhas the potential to advance human development\r\nthroughout the world. But this is not automatic. For\r\nglobalization has also increased our vulnerability,\r\ninsecurity and the possibility of marginalization. Small\r\ncountries like Jamaica and groups like CARICOM\r\ncannot and should not be expected to follow the same\r\npolicy prescriptions applied to larger, more advanced\r\ncountries. Special and differential treatment of a\r\nmeaningful kind is important, as we require policy\r\nspace for our productive sectors. It cannot be expected\r\nthat countries such as ours will abandon local\r\nproduction in agriculture and manufacturing, although\r\nwe fully recognize the growing importance and\r\npotential of the service sector in both the regional and\r\nglobal economies.\r\nIn the aftermath of Cancun, we in the global\r\ncommunity need to accept that trade rules must be\r\nasymmetrical in recognition of the diversity in levels of\r\ndevelopment and the size of economies. Trade rules\r\nmust also recognize the right of all countries to protect\r\ntheir development priorities and vulnerable groups,\r\nespecially their small farmers. Development issues as\r\nthey relate to the World Trade Organization (WTO)\r\nagenda must be defined by developing countries\r\nthemselves and not by others for us. The world\r\ncommunity must recognize these principles to ensure\r\nthat the global trade architecture can bring meaningful\r\nbenefits for all.\r\nGlobalization may bring a more integrated world,\r\nbut there will always remain significant variations in\r\nnational systems, cultures and national priorities. There\r\nis no single sustainable model for political\r\ndevelopment or economic success everywhere. We live\r\nin a diverse world where different ideas, cultural norms\r\nand standards exist. These should all be respected in\r\nthe framework of agreed principles within the United\r\nNations. In a world of such diversity and pluralism,\r\nthere should be tolerance, understanding, non-\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\ndiscrimination, self-determination, respect for equal\r\nrights and justice for all. Those, for us, are\r\ntranscendental values to which we in Jamaica and\r\nthroughout the Caribbean will always fully subscribe.\r\nThe United Nations should continue to promote\r\nrespect for diversity while promoting the common\r\nprinciples and ideals that form the foundations of\r\ninternational law and order and international\r\ncooperation. This provides the only key for the pursuit\r\nof enduring peace, harmony and real development in\r\nthe global village to which we all belong.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I thank the Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nDefence of Jamaica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Percival James Patterson, Prime Minister\r\nand Minister for Defence of Jamaica, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mari Alkatiri, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear a\r\nstatement by the Prime Minister of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nMr. Mari Alkatiri, Prime Minister of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming the Prime Minister of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, His Excellency\r\nMr. Mari Alkatiri. I invite him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Alkatiri (Timor-Leste) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): At the outset,\r\nallow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to\r\npreside over the work of this session of the General\r\nAssembly. We are confident that you will draw on all\r\nyour experience and wisdom to conduct successfully\r\nthe work of this Assembly. I assure you of all the\r\nsupport and cooperation of my delegation and wish you\r\nsuccess in your task.\r\nI would also like to congratulate the former\r\nPresident, Mr. Jan Kavan, for the exceptional way in\r\nwhich he presided over the work of the fifty-seventh\r\nsession.\r\nI speak today with a mixture of happiness and\r\nsorrow. I am happy to address the Assembly for the\r\nfirst time in this plenary in my capacity as Prime\r\nMinister of my young country, after more than two\r\ndecades of having sought understanding and support\r\nfor the cause of my people and having often lobbied for\r\nsupport in the corridors of this building. I am also\r\ndeeply saddened, however, for having lost, just over a\r\nmonth ago, an old friend — Mr. Sergio Vieira\r\nde Mello — an innocent victim of intolerance,\r\nextremism and terrorism. I wish to pay tribute to his\r\nmemory and to all those who have served the United\r\nNations and lost their lives in Baghdad and other\r\nturbulent regions of the world.\r\nIt was under the guidance of Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan, represented in Timor-Leste by\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, that exactly one year ago\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste became the\r\n191st Member of this Organization. The President of\r\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste,\r\nMr. Xanana Gusmão, and I bore witness to that historic\r\nact.\r\nSince then, our country has experienced\r\nsignificant progress in the consolidation of our nascent\r\ndemocracy. My Government has presided over the\r\nstrengthening of national cohesion and has given\r\npriority to the unequivocal affirmation of the Republic\r\nas a democratic State founded on the rule of law by\r\ntaking normative measures in governance to implement\r\nthe provisions of a modern Constitution drafted by the\r\nTimorese and adopted by an Assembly democratically\r\nelected by the people.\r\nOpen governance is one of the programmes of my\r\nGovernment. Based on the principles of good\r\ngovernance, inclusion, participation of the individual\r\nand collective responsibility, open governance was\r\ninitiated in January this year. It consists of bringing the\r\nGovernment to the people in the remote areas of the\r\ncountry to hear first hand their priorities, problems and\r\nneeds, as well as to clarify to the people the national\r\ndevelopment plan, the Government programme,\r\navailable resources and the challenges ahead. It also\r\nseeks to instil a greater sense of responsibility in the\r\npeople and to make them better understand the need for\r\ntheir participation in the reconstruction of the country\r\nvis-à-vis the implementation of the national plan, the\r\nmethods of achieving the objectives of economic\r\ngrowth and of the reduction and eradication of poverty.\r\nIn relation to the legislative process, we have\r\nprioritized the adoption of laws for the foundation of\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nthe State, above all in order to avoid taking\r\ndiscretionary and subjective measures that are without\r\nlegal foundation. Hence, more than 30 decrees and\r\nlaws have been adopted by the Government for\r\napproval by the National Parliament. In this manner,\r\nwe will create an institutional culture of democracy,\r\ngiving basis to a democratic State founded on the rule\r\nof law and the principle of good governance.\r\nThe challenges are enormous, however. Of the\r\n900 schools destroyed in 1999, around 700 have been\r\nrehabilitated and more than 30 new schools\r\nconstructed. Despite this, 25 per cent of our children\r\nremain without access to education.\r\nIn the tertiary sector, we have a national\r\nuniversity with more than 7,000 students. Hundreds of\r\ncandidates are frustrated that their expectations of\r\ngraduating from the national university have not been\r\nmet. We now have a proliferation of institutions of\r\nhigher learning that are not officially recognized by the\r\nGovernment. To deal with this situation, the\r\nGovernment has assumed the responsibility of\r\npreparing rules.\r\nIn health care, similar challenges are being faced.\r\nMuch of the infrastructure has been rehabilitated and\r\nmore is being built, but the people want more\r\nassistance and means of support. They ask for more\r\ndoctors, more nurses, more midwives, more\r\nambulances and health centres closer to their villages.\r\nA national health policy has been adopted by the\r\nGovernment. We hope soon to be able to reduce the\r\ndifficulties in this area with the cooperation of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China and the Republic of Cuba\r\nin the provision of doctors to operate in the rural areas.\r\nIn agriculture, more than 60 per cent of the\r\nirrigation system has been repaired and new systems\r\nhave been built. It is important now to instruct farmers\r\nin the best methods of use for their systems and to\r\nmake them responsible for the maintenance of those\r\nsystems while the remainder is being repaired.\r\nIn infrastructure, in general, the repairs and\r\nmaintenance have been slow and difficult. There are\r\n6,000 kilometres of roads to be rehabilitated and\r\nmaintained, and our people are demanding the opening\r\nof many others. Many bridges need to be rebuilt,\r\ncompleted or built outright.\r\nWe also are facing problems in the electrical\r\nsector, which is in deficit. We have re-established\r\nelectricity production in all districts and in 55 of the 65\r\nsub-districts. Dili, the capital, has power 24 hours a\r\nday. In the meantime, it is the policy of my\r\nGovernment to identify and develop alternative sources\r\nof energy that are more accessible and sustainable.\r\nCurrently, we are conducting a feasibility study of such\r\nresources, in particular in the area of hydropower.\r\nAccess to running water for consumption is very\r\nlimited. However, it is undeniable that the number of\r\npeople with access to running water is increasing daily,\r\nmore so than in 1999.\r\nIn the area of telecommunications, we are\r\nimplementing an ambitious project overseen by Timor-\r\nLeste Telecom through a concession in the build-\r\noperate-transfer system.\r\nAt the end of this year, all district capitals will\r\nhave at their disposal fixed and mobile telephones, for\r\nboth domestic and international purposes. With the\r\ncompletion and installation of the telecommunications\r\nsystem, we will also create the technical conditions\r\nnecessary for the development of television and radio,\r\ndelivering the best service in the media sector, which is\r\nfree, vibrant and responsible.\r\nThe process of reconstruction is taking place in\r\nan environment of peace and stability. However, areas\r\nthat are key for guaranteeing the sustainability and\r\ncredibility of the entire process, such as the judicial\r\nsystem, defence and security, will continue to require\r\nsubstantial assistance and support for some time to\r\ncome.\r\nIn other sectors of the Administration, we need\r\nqualified people to assist in the development of the\r\ncapacity of the Timorese, in particular in the\r\nconsolidation of the financial and banking systems,\r\nborder control, legislative drafting and the definition of\r\na national policy, promotion of investment and\r\ntechnology transfer.\r\nWith this in mind, I would like to reiterate that, in\r\norder to guarantee the sustainability of the entire\r\nprocess and to meet two major aspirations – that of our\r\npeople for peace, democracy and development, and that\r\nof the international community to continue to promote\r\nTimor-Leste as a success story, we must not forget to\r\nsay the following.\r\nTo our people, we would say — as we have been\r\ndoing — that they should be more patient. Above all,\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nwe must demand their participation and that they\r\nshoulder their responsibilities.\r\nWe ask the international community for\r\nconsistency, continued dynamic partnership and\r\nsupport.\r\nTo the General Assembly in particular, we ask\r\nthat it endorse the Economic and Social Council’s\r\ndecision to include Timor-Leste in the list of least\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nIn keeping with its history of struggling for\r\nhuman dignity, my country has ratified a number of\r\nimportant international human rights treaties. We are\r\naware that the ratification of these international\r\ninstruments creates legal obligations, and the Timorese\r\nState will do its utmost to implement its commitments\r\nunder those instruments.\r\nWith regard to external relations, we continue to\r\ndevelop ties of friendship and cooperation with our\r\nneighbours, namely, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia,\r\nJapan, South Korea and New Zealand, and in particular\r\nwith our two closest neighbours, Indonesia and\r\nAustralia.\r\nAs Prime Minister, I have made official or\r\nworking visits to Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines,\r\nIndonesia, Thailand, New Zealand, Mozambique,\r\nAngola, Portugal and the People’s Republic of China.\r\nAt the beginning of this month, a meeting of the\r\nJoint Indonesia-Timor-Leste Ministerial Commission\r\nwas held with a view to resolving a number of residual\r\nissues of recent years, as well as to promoting new\r\ncooperation in the areas of commerce, investment,\r\ndevelopment, education, health and security. The\r\nmeeting had a positive outcome. We hope to finalize\r\nthe demarcation of our land boundary this year in order\r\nto begin negotiations on our maritime boundaries.\r\nBoundaries, whether land or sea, define the territory of\r\na country. Within a territory, one can exercise powers\r\nof sovereignty or jurisdiction. For this reason, Timor-\r\nLeste, having as its neighbours two large and friendly\r\ncountries — Indonesia and Australia — hopes to see its\r\nborders with both countries demarcated or delimited by\r\nthe end of my Government’s mandate, so that all the\r\nresources belonging to the people of Timor-Leste can\r\nbe exploited in a free and sovereign manner, for the\r\nbenefit of present and future generations of Timorese.\r\nThe relationship between Timor-Leste and its\r\nneighbours is developing in a constructive and dynamic\r\nmanner at the bilateral, trilateral and multilateral\r\nlevels.\r\nTimor-Leste enjoys special observer status in the\r\nPacific Forum and has participated as a guest in the\r\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).\r\nTimor-Leste is a fully fledged member of the\r\nCommunity of Portuguese-Speaking Countries; the\r\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific-European Union; the\r\nWorld Bank; the International Monetary Fund; the\r\nAsian Development Bank; and various specialized\r\nUnited Nations agencies.\r\nThe fight against terrorism, organized crime and\r\ntrafficking in human beings, drugs and illegal arms is\r\nat the top of the agenda, regionally and in Timor-Leste.\r\nWe will make every effort to contribute to the\r\neradication of these ills, which are turning into a real\r\nepidemic with the development of new technology.\r\nTimor-Leste is a country of South-east Asia\r\nwhich is linked to the Pacific by geography, history and\r\nculture. Our people are proud to be part of this great\r\ngeographical region of Asia and Oceania — rich in\r\nhistory, culture and civilization, and comprising more\r\nthan one fifth of humanity. We are deeply grateful to all\r\nour Asian brothers — Japan, the People’s Republic of\r\nChina, the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, India,\r\nMalaysia, Singapore and Thailand — who have\r\nresponded without fail to our appeal for assistance, on\r\na major or modest scale, depending on the capacity and\r\nexperience of each country. We are grateful to all of\r\nthem.\r\nI have just concluded a visit to the People’s\r\nRepublic of China. Within weeks, Timor-Leste will\r\nreceive the Prime Minister of Malaysia,\r\nMr. Mahathir Mohamad. In December, we will be\r\nhonoured with a visit from the Prime Minister of the\r\nKingdom of Thailand.\r\nWe continue to strengthen our relationships with\r\nother countries in South-east Asia, in particular Brunei\r\nDarussalam, Cambodia, Laos and Viet Nam.\r\nWe deem it regrettable that the process of\r\ndialogue and national reconciliation in Myanmar is at a\r\nstandstill. Timor-Leste associates itself with the\r\nconcerns and disappointments of our friends in\r\nASEAN, and we join our voice with those of others in\r\nthe international community to appeal for the\r\nimmediate release of Mrs. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and\r\nof all others who are being detained, and for the\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nresumption of talks and of the process of reconciliation\r\nand democratization.\r\nMy Government takes note of the commitments\r\nundertaken by General Khin Nyunt, Prime Minister of\r\nthe Union of Myanmar, in his speech of 30 August\r\n2003. We would like to express our deep concern at the\r\nabandonment by the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and its stated intention to\r\nproduce nuclear weapons. The Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea has three countries as its neighbours\r\nthat over the years have demonstrated friendship and\r\nsolidarity. None of those three countries presents any\r\nthreat to its security or sovereignty, thus the production\r\nof nuclear weapons cannot be justified.\r\nTimor-Leste is a small country with a small\r\npopulation. Nonetheless, it has coastlines on two\r\noceans and is linked to two continents. Historically, we\r\nwere for five centuries the only Portuguese colony in\r\nthe region, and, during a quarter century, a territory\r\noccupied by Indonesia. More than 90 per cent of the\r\npopulation of my country is Catholic, and there are also\r\ntwo minority religious groups — Protestants and\r\nMuslims.\r\nHistory determined that we would be different.\r\nOur geographical situation conferred on us conditions\r\nfor converging and relating. We remain different and,\r\nwithin that difference, we find our identity and sense of\r\nopenness and tolerance. We know that we have\r\nsomething to give, but we also have much to receive.\r\nI am a Muslim of Arab descent and the Prime\r\nMinister of a country with a Catholic majority. Our tiny\r\nMuslim community lives in peace and tranquillity,\r\nintegrated into society in general without losing its\r\nidentity and without feeling alienated or discriminated\r\nagainst. The Timorese Catholic leadership has been\r\nexemplary in preaching respect and tolerance in\r\nrelation to all religious faiths, constantly searching for\r\ndialogue, cooperation, participation and mutual respect.\r\nMy country does not intend to put itself forward\r\nas a model of tolerance, mutual respect and coexistence\r\nbetween religions. I am speaking about our experience\r\nonly to say that in this world of hate, violence,\r\nintolerance and extremism, there are some oases of\r\ntolerance, peace and tranquillity that deserve to be the\r\nsource of new energy.\r\nFanatics and extremists have existed throughout\r\nhistory and no region or civilization in the world can\r\nclaim exclusive rights to virtue or truth. In this\r\nglobalized world, there is no place for racial or\r\ncultural, much less religious, superiority. Extremists\r\nand terrorists have always existed. The fundamental\r\ndifference is that the terrorists of today benefit from\r\nglobalization and make use of modern technology as a\r\nmeans of achieving their objectives.\r\nIt is rhetoric, and unacceptable, to define different\r\ncivilizations and religions as a target. The fundamental\r\nreason for violence in the world is inequality in\r\ndevelopment and, in particular, the injustice of the\r\ninternational economic order. The target of extremists\r\nand Islamic terrorists is not the West, its culture and\r\ndominant religions. Rather, it should be stated that the\r\nWest is a target as a consequence of the global order.\r\nWe are witnessing a new reality. The agenda of\r\nthe extremists is primarily the toppling of moderate and\r\nelite regimes and the imposition of theocratic systems\r\nin which the universal values embraced by a\r\ndemocratic State are called into question, as they\r\ncontradict their views. Such an agenda would mean a\r\nreturn to the Middle Ages, with the Islamic extremists\r\ndetermining the fate of their citizens.\r\nThe fight against extremism, fanaticism and\r\nterrorism must be waged on all fronts. One is the\r\nmilitary front, where action must be seriously thought\r\nthrough and always implemented with great caution\r\nand clear-sightedness. The other fronts include the\r\npolitical, economic and social. The fight against\r\npoverty and exclusion must be integrated into our\r\nglobal strategy in the war against terrorism.\r\nMy Government congratulates the people of Iraq\r\non the end of one of the bloodiest dictatorships in\r\nhistory. The people of Timor-Leste know only too well\r\nthe significance of a dictatorship. In order to be free of\r\nit, we sacrificed hundreds of thousands of our children\r\nin decades of unequal struggle.\r\nDuring our struggle for independence and\r\ndemocracy, we always believed that our efforts should\r\nbe focused on re-establishing international legality in\r\nour country, ensuring that the United Nations take\r\nresponsibility and demanding that the international\r\ncommunity respect the Charter and United Nations\r\nresolutions on Timor-Leste.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nMy Government defends the concept that the\r\ncentral role of the United Nations must be respected by\r\nall countries, in particular those with the means and\r\nresources to strengthen the role of our Organization.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Iraq, it is urgent\r\nthat international legality be re-established in that\r\ncountry. The only legitimate means of transferring\r\nsovereignty to the people of Iraq is to hand over power\r\nto their democratically elected representatives.\r\nWe believe that the Arab League must be a\r\nprivileged partner of the United Nations in the process\r\nof transition and reconstruction in Iraq. As it is a\r\nregional organization representing more than 200\r\nmillion people who mostly profess the same religion,\r\nspeak the same language and are of the same cultural\r\nand historical origin, it must not be ignored or\r\nbypassed when its own interests and that of the region\r\nare at stake.\r\nMy country is a good example of the kind of a\r\npartnership that can develop when the United Nations\r\nand its obvious natural role in the resolution of\r\nconflicts and the mobilization of international\r\nconsensus is recognized. Each process is unique and\r\nhas its own dimensions and characteristics, but our\r\npositive experience can be repeated in other places, and\r\ncan serve as a reference point for Iraq.\r\nI would like to comment on two issues related to\r\nthe Middle East, beginning with Palestine. We express\r\nour deep disappointment that the peace process has\r\nregressed and that violence has escalated in that part of\r\nthe world. We feel encouraged by the presentation of\r\nthe road map, and hope that it can assist in accelerating\r\nthe peace process.\r\nWe reaffirm our support for the road map and for\r\nthe right of the people of Palestine to self-\r\ndetermination, independence and the establishment of\r\nan independent and sovereign State. We appeal to all\r\nthe parties in that bloody conflict to cease all forms of\r\nviolence, to resume dialogue and rigorously to respect\r\nthe road map as agreed to with the Quartet.\r\nWith respect to Western Sahara, the Arab and\r\nMuslim people of that former Spanish Territory\r\ncontinue to wait patiently for the holding of a\r\nreferendum on self-determination, as agreed to by all\r\nparties in 1994. We appeal to the General Assembly,\r\nthe Secretary-General, the Security Council, the Arab\r\nLeague and the African Union to encourage both\r\nparties to return to direct dialogue with a view to\r\nestablishing a definitive date for the holding of the\r\nreferendum on self-determination in the territory of\r\nWestern Sahara.\r\nMy Government is closely following the situation\r\nin Guinea-Bissau. While deploring the military coup\r\nthat toppled the elected President, we are relieved that\r\nthere was no bloodshed or loss of life. My Government\r\nsupports the holding of new elections with a view to\r\nthe restoration of a constitutional democratic order, if\r\npossible within the framework of the United Nations\r\nand the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries,\r\nto achieve the necessary support for the bringing of\r\npeace, stable government and economic recovery.\r\nWe regret the breakdown in talks during the most\r\nrecent round of the World Trade Organization\r\nMinisterial Conference held in Cancun. The\r\nindustrialized nations must understand that the\r\ninternational trade systems must be rectified. It is\r\nneither ethical nor moral for the rich countries to\r\npreach democracy, human rights and the dogma of a\r\nfree market, while practising protectionist policies that\r\ncondemn hundreds of millions of human beings to\r\nperpetual poverty and dependency. It is less than\r\nethical when they teach the rules of the free market\r\nwhile subsidizing their farmers with billions of dollars,\r\nmaking the products of our countries, which have a\r\ngreater comparative advantage, increasingly less\r\ncompetitive.\r\nTimor-Leste has benefited from international\r\nsolidarity, and we are grateful for that. But we cannot\r\nremain silent in the face of injustices and anti-\r\neconomic policies that impoverish the rest of the\r\nworld. We appeal for the renegotiation of debt and for\r\ndebt relief for the poor and indebted countries. But we\r\nalso believe that debt relief must be proportional to the\r\nmeasures taken by each country in adopting strategies\r\nfor sustainable development and focusing on the\r\neradication of poverty. This means increased\r\nexpenditure on public health and education, reduced\r\nmilitary expenditure, the strengthening of democratic\r\ninstitutions, the promotion of human rights and the\r\nindependence of the judiciary. Those are conditions\r\nthat are indispensable for peace and prosperity.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to touch on the theme\r\nof reform of the United Nations. The creation of this\r\ninstitution was the result of the collective experience of\r\nhumankind, victim of the greatest scourge in history.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nWe congratulate the founders on their vision, but we\r\nare conscious that the institution reflects the reality of\r\nthat period. In 1945 there were merely 51 Members,\r\nand it was viewed as a club for the rich and powerful, a\r\n“white man’s club”. But the United Nations today is a\r\ntruly global institution, with 191 Members.\r\nThe recent experience of Iraq provoked a new\r\ndebate on the need for the structural reform of our\r\ninstitution, beginning with the Security Council, which\r\nis increasingly being called upon to provide opinions\r\nand to intervene in many regions of the world. We\r\nsupport an increase in the number of permanent\r\nmembers of the Security Council to reflect the current\r\ndemographic reality and the new world balance.\r\nMany people are frequently asking themselves,\r\nand asking out loud, a few questions, such as “Is it fair\r\nfor the Western Group to have three permanent seats in\r\nthe Security Council, while Asia has only one and\r\nAfrica and Latin America have none? Is it possible that\r\nIndia, the largest democracy in the world, with more\r\nthan one billion inhabitants, does not have the same\r\nstatus as others? Is it possible that Brazil, with the\r\nworld’s ninth largest economy and Latin America’s\r\nlargest, a crossroads of races and civilizations — Ibero-\r\nLatin American, African and indigenous people —\r\ndoes not have status as a permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council?” Throughout its history, Brazil has\r\nshown prudence and balance in the conduct of its\r\nforeign politics, an active and constructive engagement\r\nat the regional and international level and always a\r\nvoice of moderation and dialogue.\r\nThere are certain procedures that may have been\r\nunderstandable during the cold war period. But today\r\nthe way must be made for principles of democratic\r\ndecision-making that are acceptable and universally\r\npracticed. We must question these paradigms.\r\nWe also believe that the term of the mandate for\r\nnon-permanent members must be reduced to between\r\nsix months and one year. That will give the 191\r\nmembers of our Organization the opportunity to serve\r\nin this organ. Besides, a shorter period will allow the\r\nless privileged to feel the desire to invest their human\r\nand financial resources to serve on the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nThe reform and the democratization of a number\r\nof organs of our Organization are necessary and urgent.\r\nThe errors and failures of the past, when the Security\r\nCouncil was powerless and indifferent to human\r\ntragedy, should compel us all to have the courage to\r\naccept a fair share of the decision-making that affects\r\nus all.\r\nLet the big, rich and powerful know that humility\r\nis the greatest virtue. Leadership means knowing how\r\nto dialogue, persuade and build alliances and\r\nconsensus. There are challenges ahead. There are many\r\nthreats. The resources of 191 countries are represented\r\nin this huge Organization. To respond to these\r\nchallenges and threats, we must unite and build bridges\r\nof consensus and active cooperation.\r\nAllow me to conclude by saying that the future\r\nbelongs to the optimists. We are here today because we\r\nfavour optimism. That is why the struggle must\r\ncontinue.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the statement\r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Mari Alkatiri, Prime Minister of the\r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Morshed Khan, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the People’s Republic of\r\nBangladesh.\r\nMr. Khan (Bangladesh): I bring a message of\r\npeace from Bangladesh.\r\nPlease allow me to congratulate the President on\r\nhis election. I wish him every success in the formidable\r\ntask of leading the United Nations to continued\r\nrelevance and credibility in these stormy times. I am\r\nconfident that he will build upon the legacy left by his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for his\r\nstewardship in these difficult times. The United\r\nNations has been faced with extremely challenging\r\nsituations over the past year. We have lost one of our\r\nmost outstanding men of peace —\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and many of his colleagues.\r\nSuch senseless and despicable acts must not be\r\nrepeated.\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nThe new millennium, which we all heralded with\r\nso much hope, has been plunged into turmoil.\r\nIntervening events in the last three years have changed\r\nour world forever. They have left us groping for\r\nsolutions. The events of 11 September 2001, the\r\nAfghan and the Iraq war, the open confrontation\r\nbetween Israel and Hamas and the African civil wars\r\nshape some of the dimensions of this world of disorder.\r\nDriving these crises are new realities — an all-out\r\noffensive against terrorism, arguments for pre-emption\r\nand unilateral action as an option for security, the\r\ntargeting of Islamic radicalism and its fall-out as\r\nreligious profiling. Somewhere, the coin of global\r\ncooperation has been debased.\r\nEach year we come to this Assembly to reaffirm\r\nour faith in the United Nations and our commitment to\r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter. Today, we\r\npause to grapple with doubts that have arisen about the\r\nrelevance of the world body. I hasten to add that for\r\nBangladesh, this pause is very short-lived. The cardinal\r\nquestion is not what is wrong with the United Nations,\r\nbut what is right with it and how we can make it serve\r\nour purposes despite seeming setbacks.\r\nThree compelling factors stand out. The first is\r\nuniversality. All 191 States of the world wish to be\r\nwithin the fold of the international community. Second\r\nis the flip side of globalization. The bottom line is that\r\nno one State alone can deal with the intricate problems\r\nfacing our world — be it the dysfunction of the\r\ncollective security system, an interlocking economic,\r\nmonetary, financial and trade grid, the challenges of\r\nglobalization, international terrorism, environmental\r\ndegradation, new diseases, trans-border organized\r\ncrime, and so on. The conclusion is clear. The United\r\nNations is indispensable as the central organ for the\r\ncollective management of world affairs.\r\nThe third factor is legitimacy. As has been\r\nunderlined, the greatest strength of the United Nations\r\nremains its legitimacy, founded on the bedrock\r\nprinciples of international law. There is no substitute\r\nfor that legitimacy. It is by this measure that we look to\r\nthe United Nations.\r\nBut as the Secretary-General notes in his report\r\non the implementation of the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, “The war exposed deep divisions in the\r\ninternational community, with accusations of double\r\nagendas”. He goes on to observe that “The war in Iraq\r\nbrought to the fore a host of questions of principle and\r\npractice that challenge the United Nations and the\r\ninternational community as a whole”. This is a sad\r\ncommentary on the state of the world body today.\r\nIn contrast, we have noted that wherever the\r\nUnited Nations was allowed to take up its rightful role\r\nand responsibility, and where it was provided with\r\nnecessary support, it has achieved success, durable\r\npeace and stability. The experience of East Timor,\r\nSierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the\r\nCongo, to name only a few, have vindicated the\r\nlegitimacy, role and relevance of the United Nations.\r\nWar can be won by military might; the challenge lies in\r\nwinning peace. That is what the United Nations, with\r\nover half a century of experience in peacemaking,\r\npeacekeeping and peace-building, is best placed to do.\r\nWe in Bangladesh place our full trust — and have\r\ntotal confidence — in the capacity of the United\r\nNations to address matters of international and global\r\nconcern, including peace and security. We see the\r\nUnited Nations as a source of inspiration, initiative and\r\nsupport in our national, regional and international\r\nendeavours. It is in this forum that we establish\r\ncommon standards, universal values and shared\r\nprogrammes. In a globalizing world, no nation is an\r\nisland; none can prosper alone. We therefore believe\r\nthat today, more than ever before, the Organization\r\ndeserves the support of all of our nations in a more\r\nactive and demonstrable way.\r\nThe Secretary-General deserves our appreciation\r\nfor bringing the focus of the Organization back to its\r\nsocio-economic agenda. We welcome his report on the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nHis assessment of the progress in achieving the\r\nMillennium Development Goals is sobering. While\r\nsigns of progress for a given region are noted, the road\r\nto 2015 is long for many of our nations. The report of\r\nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the\r\nPacific and the United Nations Development\r\nProgramme concerning the Millennium Development\r\nGoals, for instance, draws attention to the worrying\r\ndeclines in the flow of official development assistance\r\nto the least developed areas and countries; it described\r\nthat as “unacceptable and unconscionable”. The report\r\nhas also called for reforms in the international trade\r\nsystem to help the poorest countries.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, the setback at the World\r\nTrade Organization Ministerial Conference, held at\r\nCancún, warrants an early resumption of the\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nnegotiations. A breakthrough will require courageous\r\ndecisions and significant compromises. Our\r\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals\r\nalso requires that the negotiations be concluded\r\nsuccessfully. The global economic situation today\r\ndictates equitable trade policies and fair trade practices,\r\nwhich were sought in the Doha round. The economic\r\nsurvival and the socio-economic stability of many\r\nnations depend on how we handle post-Cancun\r\nchallenges. The stakes are very high for all of us, in\r\nboth the short and the long term.\r\nThe development policies and programmes of our\r\nGovernment, led by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh,\r\nBegum Khaleda Zia, are based on the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. Our resource allocation in the\r\nsocial sector remains high, and we have prepared a\r\nthree-year economic growth, poverty reduction and\r\nsocial development strategy. That is a major initial\r\npolicy framework. We look forward to working closely\r\ntogether with our development partners in our\r\nimplementation of those policies.\r\nThe governance paradigm in recent decades has\r\nhappily embraced the fundamental tenets of democracy.\r\nIn Bangladesh, we have the necessary institutions in\r\nplace. We are reforming, modernizing and expanding\r\nthem. As a thriving democracy ourselves, we support\r\nUnited Nations efforts aimed at promoting the rule of\r\nlaw, good governance and human rights. We believe\r\nthat all human rights — including the right to\r\ndevelopment — should be pursued in a comprehensive\r\nmanner and with a holistic approach.\r\nThe past year has seen serious developments in\r\nthe international peace and security situation,\r\nespecially in Africa and the Middle East. Bangladesh\r\nhas taken a positive and constructive approach to all\r\nthese issues. We have consistently supported the efforts\r\nof the United Nations in that regard. We have done that\r\nas a matter of our commitment to the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the United Nations and its Charter.\r\nIn practical terms, Bangladesh has remained a\r\nmajor partner of the United Nations in its peace and\r\nsecurity mission. Over the past two decades,\r\nBangladesh has participated in United Nations\r\npeacekeeping operations in four continents, including\r\nthe most perilous ones. We are currently among the\r\nlargest contributors of troops and other personnel to\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, with\r\nthousands of our troops in eight Missions, in Côte\r\nd’Ivoire, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Kosovo,\r\nTimor-Leste and Georgia. Recently, we are also\r\ncommitted to taking part in the proposed United\r\nNations mission in Liberia.\r\nThe people of Iraq have inherited a civilization\r\nthat is ancient and one of the most glorious. The\r\npresent situation in Iraq should be resolved while\r\npreserving the interests of the people of Iraq and\r\nensuring long-term peace, security and stability in the\r\nregion. Bangladesh reiterates its support for the\r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and political\r\nindependence of the country. We stand ready to take\r\npart in the reconstruction and rebuilding of Iraq in the\r\ntrue spirit of brotherhood that characterizes the\r\nrelationship between our two nations and peoples. We\r\nreiterate our call for ensuring a clear, effective and\r\ncredible role for the United Nations in Iraq’s transition\r\nto democracy and in the country’s reconstruction.\r\nBangladesh supports the forthcoming international\r\nconference on Iraq’s reconstruction to be convened by\r\nthe United Nations, and we look forward to a\r\nsuccessful outcome.\r\nThe recent developments in the Middle East are\r\nextremely worrying. It is clear that the progress made\r\nfrom Oslo to Madrid and the present is now seriously\r\nthreatened. The road map that the Palestinian side\r\naccepted with great courage has not been seriously\r\naccepted or implemented by the other side.\r\nPreconditions have been imposed, making peace\r\ndifficult. The Israeli practices that are well known to\r\nthe Assembly continue to be applied in occupied\r\nPalestine. There are gross and systematic violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law and fundamental human\r\nrights. The vicious and criminal announcement of the\r\nintention to expel and even assassinate President\r\nYasser Arafat calls for global condemnation in the\r\nstrongest possible terms. All of that runs counter to the\r\nglobal demand for the peaceful settlement and\r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State to live as a good\r\nneighbour in peace and security.\r\nBangladesh reiterates its support for the early\r\nestablishment of a sovereign, independent State of\r\nPalestine in accordance with the relevant United\r\nNations resolutions. We call for a more active role on\r\nthe part of the United Nations, and we ask the Security\r\nCouncil to assume its responsibilities towards the\r\npeople of Palestine. We urge the diplomatic Quartet to\r\nintensify its efforts to prevent further escalation and to\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\naddress the threats against President Arafat, a Nobel\r\nPeace laureate and the undisputed leader of the\r\nPalestinian people. We urge that the peace process be\r\nplaced back on track. We call for renewed efforts\r\naimed at a comprehensive solution of the Middle East\r\nissues within a given time frame.\r\nInternational terrorism remains a scourge. In the\r\npost-11 September 2001 context, it has taken centre\r\nstage in our global concerns. We reiterate our\r\nunequivocal condemnation of terrorism in all its forms\r\nand manifestations. Bangladesh is party to several\r\ninternational conventions on combating terrorism, and\r\nwe are in the process of acceding to the remaining\r\nones. We are actively involved in the elaboration of an\r\nadditional protocol to the South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation’s Regional Convention on\r\nSuppression of Terrorism. The protocol will strengthen\r\nthe Convention by incorporating provisions that\r\ninclude those contained in recent Security Council\r\nresolutions, in particular resolution 1373 (2001).\r\nBangladesh attaches great emphasis on disarmament.\r\nWe believe that it is closely related to international\r\npeace and security and has a direct relationship with\r\ndevelopment. Bangladesh is party to all international\r\ndisarmament treaties covering nuclear, biological,\r\nchemical and conventional weapons. Seeking general\r\nand complete disarmament is our constitutional\r\ncommitment. International peace and security, human\r\nsecurity and the security of our planet have been the\r\nprime considerations in making our policy choices.\r\nWe have supported all efforts at disarmament. We\r\ncontinue to believe in the value of all measures, even\r\npartial efforts at arms control and disarmament. Our\r\nconviction has been vindicated by our progress in the\r\ncontrol and ban of a number of weapons. The\r\nmultilateral track, including the Conference on\r\nDisarmament, needs to be revived.\r\nBangladesh has renounced all weapons of mass\r\ndestruction — biological, chemical and nuclear. The\r\nsituation along the borders of the two nuclear-armed\r\nSouth Asian countries has been a matter of global\r\nconcern. As a close neighbour, we too have a\r\nlegitimate cause for concern. In this context, we\r\napplaud the Secretary-General for his recent call for the\r\nelimination of all nuclear weapons. The imperatives, in\r\nview also of the threats to the existing regimes and\r\ntheir implications, do not require elaboration in this\r\nHouse. We would thus urge a renewed consideration of\r\nthe International Court of Justice (ICJ) opinion and the\r\nreport of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination\r\nof Nuclear Weapons.\r\nIn our region, as elsewhere, particularly since we\r\nare challenged by abject poverty, hunger, illiteracy,\r\nlack of safe drinking water and disease, our priorities\r\nshould be socio-economic development, not\r\nnuclearization. We need to foster cooperation, not\r\nprepare for confrontation.\r\nIt is with this thought that our late\r\nPresident Shaheed Ziaur Rahman conceived of\r\ninstitutionalized regional cooperation leading to the\r\nemergence of the South Asian Association for Regional\r\nCooperation (SAARC). We firmly believe in the value\r\nand indeed the imperative of cooperation in our region.\r\nWe hope that together we shall also be able to establish\r\na peaceful, friendly and prosperous South Asia. We\r\nwould draw inspiration from other parts of the world\r\nwhere such regional economic integration has worked\r\nwell for the people of those regions.\r\nIn today’s world, perhaps the most potential\r\nsources of conflict of interest within countries and\r\namong them would centre on natural resources, in\r\nparticular, fresh water. We call for management of\r\nshared resources without depriving or causing damage\r\nto the economy or ecology of any of the countries\r\nconcerned or the region.\r\nFor example, any unilateral withdrawal of water\r\nfrom international rivers should be prohibited, as such\r\naction would cause great damage to the environment,\r\nagriculture, industry and the overall economy and\r\necology of other countries. All actions in such areas\r\nshould conform to international law and the norms of\r\nequity, justice and, of course, fair play. Any decision\r\nwith regard to shared natural wealth should be through\r\nconsultation among all concerned countries.\r\nBangladesh identifies itself closely with the\r\nproblems of Africa. We believe in the efficacy of\r\nSouth-South cooperation as a mutually beneficial\r\npractice among societies at comparable stages of\r\ndevelopment. The launching of the African Union has\r\nbeen inspiring and that of the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), encouraging. We are\r\nconfident that the leadership of Africa and its people\r\nwill succeed in transforming the continent into a\r\npeaceful and prosperous one.\r\nWe have developed greater knowledge, special\r\nbonds and closer friendship with many African nations\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nthrough our participation in their democracy and\r\nnation-building efforts and through peacekeeping and\r\ndevelopment activities. Bangladesh will continue to\r\nwork together with them in addressing the challenges\r\nof building durable peace and sustainable development.\r\nThe specific problems facing the landlocked and\r\nsmall island developing countries require special\r\nattention. We hope the Almaty Conference has created\r\na fresh impetus to address their needs. We must also\r\naccord support to countries that are in the process of\r\ntransition in their economies.\r\nThe 1990s have seen a series of major United\r\nNations conferences. Each has adopted an elaborate\r\nimplementable programme of action with clear and\r\nspecific responsibilities at national, regional and\r\ninternational levels. The International Conference on\r\nFinancing for Development, held in Monterrey,\r\nMexico, the World Summit on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment, held at Johannesburg, and the Third\r\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\r\nCountries, which met in Brussels, have reinforced the\r\nearlier commitments. Now is the time to focus our\r\nefforts — individual and collective — to implementing\r\nthe programmes of action emanating from those\r\nConferences.\r\nThe United Nations has, in recent years made\r\nsignificant progress in reforming itself in\r\norganizational and substantive terms. Further progress\r\nremains to be achieved in various areas, including the\r\nSecurity Council, where reforms are essential to make\r\nthe Council more representative, democratic and\r\neffective.\r\nAlso in need for further reform are the General\r\nAssembly and other major organs, including the\r\nTrusteeship Council, which could be revived. We need\r\ncertainly to go further. Bangladesh welcomes the\r\nproposal of the Secretary-General to establish a high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent persons for examining the\r\nchallenges to peace and security. We look forward to\r\ntheir report. In this regard, we would underline the\r\nimportance of preserving multilateralism and\r\nconsensus.\r\nDecisions on budget cuts must not compromise\r\nthe functioning of the Organization and budgetary\r\nexercises must not adversely affect the interests of the\r\ndeveloping countries, in particular the least developed\r\nones. There should be adequate provision for mandated\r\nactivities in the developing countries.\r\nIt will remain our goal to bring the United\r\nNations to the centre of global development efforts.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council can play a crucial\r\nrole in this regard. It must examine innovative and\r\ncreative methods in its work. Bangladesh has sought\r\nelection to the Economic and Social Council during the\r\ncurrent session. As we have done in the past,\r\nBangladesh seeks to contribute, as a member of the\r\nCouncil, to the pursuit of the United Nations social and\r\neconomic agenda. We hope we shall receive valuable\r\nsupport from all Members of the Assembly.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals set a number\r\nof achievable targets in the most pressing areas.\r\nBangladesh is committed to achieving them for our\r\npeople. We shall also work closely with all other\r\nnations so that these objectives are realized equally for\r\nall of us. But we aspire to go beyond. We urge\r\ncontinued focus on the implementation of the outcome\r\nof the 1990s cycle of international conferences. They\r\nrepresent a comprehensive agenda for humanity for our\r\ncentury. We must follow up on them for our present\r\nand future generations and for the progress of\r\nhumankind. Let us all try to create a better world for all\r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): I now\r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Kitts\r\nand Nevis, His Excellency The Honourable Timothy\r\nHarris.\r\nMr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): My\r\nGovernment is pleased that the General Assembly’s\r\npresidency at its fifty-eighth regular session is in the\r\ncapable hands of my distinguished colleague, the\r\nForeign Minister of Saint Lucia, Senator Julian Hunte,\r\nwhose election bears witness to the importance that this\r\nOrganization holds, not just for the Government of\r\nSaint Lucia, but also for the Governments and people\r\nof the Caribbean Community. I trust that as he tackles\r\nthe critical United Nations agenda over the coming\r\nyear he will incorporate into his work the lessons of\r\nour successes as a Caribbean Community. As with his\r\npredecessor, whose steady leadership was tested during\r\na year of unprecedented challenges, he, too, can count\r\non my Government’s continued support.\r\nI take this opportunity to pay tribute to\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, other staff of the United Nations\r\nand the citizens of Iraq who lost their lives or sustained\r\ninjuries in the tragedy of Baghdad last August. We\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nshare the sorrow of the Secretary-General and his staff,\r\nand extend our profound condolences to the bereaved\r\nfamilies.\r\nI intend to focus our attention on the critical\r\nimportance of strategic partnership. Lest my statement\r\nbe misconstrued, I hasten to assure the Assembly from\r\nthe outset that my Government is neither oblivious nor\r\nindifferent to the multitude of concerns and problems\r\nthat attend and threaten our quest for international\r\npeace and security. I will be pleased to share my\r\nGovernment’s perspective on them later. But allow me\r\nfirst to share with the Assembly our national\r\nphilosophy and policy as they relate to improving the\r\nhuman condition.\r\n“How does one do that?” you ask. Improving the\r\nhuman condition is achieved by working towards\r\nhuman security. Notwithstanding the recriminations\r\nand blame, at the core of the failed World Trade\r\nOrganization round in Mexico earlier this month was\r\nthe issue of human security. Clearly, countries want\r\nguarantees as Governments struggle to meet the needs\r\nof their citizens. For my Government, human security\r\nmeans that each citizen has the right to liberty,\r\neducation, employment, an improved standard of living\r\nand economic development. We believe that human\r\nsecurity is a comprehensive and holistic concept that\r\nencompasses all aspects of the human condition.\r\nObviously, there is much that we in the Caribbean\r\ncan and must still learn from the rest of the world. But,\r\nequally, there are many valuable lessons that the rest of\r\nthe world can draw from our experiences and successes\r\nin the Caribbean. In many areas, the Caribbean is a\r\ntestament to the practicality and efficacy of functional\r\ncooperation, and of how, despite the many issues that\r\ndivide us, we continue to work together on matters\r\ncommon to us. Be it at the subregional level of the\r\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) or\r\nwithin the broader Caribbean Community\r\n(CARICOM), the progress we have made in forging\r\nconsensus and in building common institutions to\r\naddress our shared problems allows us to be able to\r\nshare best practices with the United Nations and\r\ndemonstrate how, by working together through\r\ncooperative partnerships, each of us can achieve more.\r\nFor nearly four decades, for example, the\r\nUniversity of the West Indies has cultivated many\r\ndistinguished academics and other notables. Today, it\r\nstands as a beacon of hope for our young people in\r\ntheir quest for quality higher education. To its credit,\r\nthe University continues to work with several\r\ninternationally recognized institutions and agencies in\r\nthe areas of peace and security, health care and\r\nscientific research, to name but a few. The Caribbean\r\nExaminations Council has responded adequately and\r\nwith requisite standards of excellence to the growing\r\neducation needs of the English-speaking Caribbean.\r\nWhen our students complete their education, they stand\r\nshoulder to shoulder with their counterparts around the\r\nworld. It is not my intention to boast, but for us it is a\r\nmatter of national and regional pride. Further, as the\r\nAssembly’s President is aware, many of our countries\r\nhave adopted policies that allow nationals of other\r\nmember States to travel to and work in their countries\r\nwithout the hassle of visa requirements and work\r\npermits. Although we are divided by the sea, the\r\nbridges of commitment and recognition of our common\r\nchallenges and the benefits of shared approaches are\r\nbringing us ever closer together.\r\nThe Caribbean Development Bank and the\r\nEastern Caribbean Central Bank are models of how\r\nfinancial responsibility and cooperation with and\r\namong member Governments in executing fiscal and\r\nmonetary policies can facilitate stability, underpin\r\naccountability and engender progress. For decades, the\r\nEastern Caribbean dollar, the currency of the countries\r\nof the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, has\r\nremained the bedrock of monetary stability. We are\r\nalso especially proud of the success of the OECS Court\r\nof Appeal, which has worked effectively and dutifully\r\nin dispensing justice throughout the territories over\r\nwhich it exercises jurisdiction. Further, the prudent and\r\npositive steps toward a Caribbean Single Market and\r\nEconomy (CSME), provide evidence of the\r\ndetermination of Caribbean Governments to cooperate\r\nin almost all endeavours to advance the human security\r\nof our citizens. These are but a few examples of\r\nfunctional cooperation. In every case, member\r\ncountries are better off because they work together\r\nrather than unilaterally.\r\nWe continue to incorporate in our national\r\npolicies many of the agreed principles of sustainable\r\ndevelopment. Additionally, our regional campaign to\r\nfight the spread of HIV/AIDS and treat its victims has\r\nwitnessed encouraging results under the Pan-Caribbean\r\nPartnership against HIV/AIDS. My Government wishes\r\nto commend the World Bank and the William J. Clinton\r\nPresidential Foundation for their pledges of support for\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nour work in this regard. We hope that our cooperation\r\nefforts will be a model for future partnerships in our\r\nregion and beyond.\r\nI promised earlier that I would share my\r\nGovernment’s perspective on some of the decisive\r\nissues that confront us internationally. I preface my\r\nremarks with a reminder that just over a decade earlier\r\nwe stood on the threshold of a new era of opportunity.\r\nWe celebrated the collapse of major ideological\r\nconflicts, which previously held us captive, even, I\r\ndare say, on the brink of nuclear Armageddon. As one\r\nleader remarked, nations and peoples quietly harboured\r\ndreams that the last decade of the twentieth century and\r\nthe advent of the twenty-first century would herald new\r\nopportunities to address and redress asymmetrical\r\nissues that had frustrated our collective aspirations and\r\nindividual potential. None of us, I am sure, would\r\nlikely admit that we may have squandered such\r\nprospects. However, a little more than a decade later,\r\nideological rifts seem to have been replaced by\r\npolitical chasms and new dangers.\r\nConsequently, we must re-evaluate our concept of\r\nsecurity. The Organization of American States, in its\r\nmeeting of foreign ministers last year in Barbados,\r\ntook the bold and timely step of redefining security\r\nwithin its hemisphere. Security, the foreign ministers\r\ndeclared, is diverse in scope and multidimensional in\r\nnature, requiring multifaceted approaches to address\r\npolitical, economic, social and environmental issues.\r\nThis concept clearly recognizes that we cannot separate\r\nnational, regional and international security issues from\r\npolitical, economic and social stability and their\r\nsecurity implications.\r\nWe in the Caribbean recognize that, whereas\r\nglobalization is a viable instrument of growth and\r\nprosperity for some, it has become the vehicle of ruin\r\nand despair for many of the already poor people around\r\nthe world. While countries that prosper praise\r\nglobalization and free trade, countries that suffer see\r\nthemselves as no more than the guinea pigs, the passive\r\nobjects of globalization, with very little hope of\r\nadvancing human security for their poor citizens.\r\nHow do we encourage our citizens to have faith\r\nin a system that punishes their legitimate efforts? How\r\ncan we tell the poor farmers in the developing world,\r\nstruggling to eke out an existence, to hold out hope\r\nwhen farmers in rich countries are subsidized and\r\nrewarded for overproduction? How do we ask our\r\ncitizens in small vulnerable economies to sacrifice and\r\nadopt free trade wholesale, while larger, more\r\ndeveloped economies devise new ways to deny them\r\ncrucial market access. Unless we address such\r\ninequities, there will always be resentment and\r\nmistrust. We must therefore work together to level\r\nthese bumps on the road to development. Also, we\r\nmust rob the uncivil forces of the arguments they use to\r\nfeed and exploit the anger and despair of the poor and\r\ndispossessed.\r\nI turn now to the United Nations. In our view, the\r\nUnited Nations remains central to international peace\r\nand human security. The myriad challenges facing us\r\ntoday require collective action and partnership. I hasten\r\nto add that, although the United Nations still lacks\r\nimportant elements of transparency and democracy in\r\nthe operations of the Security Council, it nevertheless\r\nrepresents the most practical framework our nations\r\nhave to address regional and international concerns in a\r\nholistic manner.\r\nI trust that, when the dust of discontent settles,\r\nwe will appreciate that no country can act alone in\r\npursuit of international peace, development and human\r\nsecurity. My Government calls on the United Nations\r\nmembership to embrace a bold vision and commitment\r\nto fighting the pull of isolation and the lure of\r\neconomic and financial engineering. Our reality today\r\nencompasses the struggles to find positive and\r\nsustainable methods for advancing our citizens’\r\ndevelopment against uncivil forces or rogue ideologies\r\nworking relentlessly to undermine them.\r\nMy Government calls on the United Nations and\r\nMember Governments to further subscribe to and\r\npromote partnership by fulfilling the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. The Millennium Goals are\r\nessential steps to improving the human condition. They\r\nare also a reliable basis for addressing many of the\r\ninequities of globalization. We urge Member States to\r\nwork to meet these goals. We can relent only when the\r\nother half of the world’s population ceases to live in\r\nabject poverty, when larger sectors of the world’s\r\npopulation can find work, and when all parents are able\r\nto send their children to school.\r\nDespite its exclusion from this international\r\nfraternity of nations, the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nremains a valuable partner for peace and development\r\nwith fullest respect for international law. We trust that\r\nits contributions and its citizens’ right to adequate\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nrepresentation can be guaranteed in the best interest of\r\nbrotherhood so that all people can live in peace and\r\nenjoy the fruits of prosperity through partnership.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis therefore urges the\r\nUnited Nations to avail itself of every possibility to\r\nfacilitate a sustainable resolution of the impasse that\r\nhampers Taiwan’s efforts to engage in international\r\ndialogue and contribute to the common interests of\r\nmankind.\r\nLet me end by reaffirming my Government’s\r\ncommitment to multilateralism and to strategic\r\npartnership.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): I give\r\nthe floor to Her Excellency Mrs. Maria de Fátima Lima\r\nVeiga, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and\r\nCommunities of the Republic of Cape Verde.\r\nMrs. Veiga (Cape Verde) (spoke in Portuguese;\r\nEnglish text furnished by the delegation): Let me at the\r\nvery outset offer my warm congratulations to Mr.\r\nHunte on his election to preside over this fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. With his proven skills\r\nin the field of international affairs and his wide-ranging\r\nexperience, we are confident that we will deal\r\neffectively with the many crucial tasks facing this\r\nAssembly. I assure him of the full support and best\r\nwishes of my delegation as he carries out the tasks of\r\nhis high office.\r\nLet me also extend our appreciation to the\r\noutgoing President, Mr. Jan Kavan, whose committed\r\nefforts guided the fifty-seventh session of this\r\nAssembly.\r\nI wish to express my delegation’s appreciation for\r\nthe indefatigable efforts of the Secretary-General to\r\npreserve and enhance the role of our Organization last\r\nyear, which proved to be one of the most difficult in its\r\nexistence. One sad sign of this was the bombing of the\r\nUnited Nations headquarters in Baghdad last month,\r\nwhich took the lives of Sergio Vieira de Mello and 21\r\nother persons of different nationalities. It was a\r\nmonstrous act that deserved strong and universal\r\ncondemnation. Nothing could justify such a senseless\r\nattack against the civil personnel of a mission whose\r\naims were none other than to help the Iraqi people to\r\nface the tragic situation in which they are living. We\r\nthus pay our respectful homage to the memory of those\r\ndedicated persons who lost their lives in the tragedy.\r\nMy country fully cooperates with the United\r\nNations bodies in the struggle against terrorism and\r\norganized crime. However, the fight against terrorism\r\nshould not lead the international community to\r\ndownplay the importance of promoting development\r\nand fighting poverty and everything associated with it,\r\nincluding hunger, illness, illiteracy and environmental\r\ndegradation. Nor should the international community\r\nforget the need to guarantee the respect of the rights of\r\npeoples and individuals, combat discrimination and all\r\nits aspects that deprive human beings of their dignity.\r\nVery relevant proposals concerning the future of\r\nour Organization have been presented by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. He stressed the need to accelerate the reform\r\nof the United Nations by adapting it to the realities of\r\nthe world in which we live, namely addressing the\r\nquestion of enlarging the Security Council and\r\nincreasing the number of its permanent members,\r\nstrengthening the General Assembly and reinvigorating\r\nthe role of the United Nations Economic and Social\r\nCouncil (ECOSOC), as well as of the United Nations\r\nas a whole, including its relationship with the Bretton\r\nWoods institutions.\r\nBy their size, economic power, regional and\r\ninternational influence, there are obvious candidates to\r\nbecome permanent members of the Security Council.\r\nTheir weight in international affairs can no longer be\r\noverlooked. We should not lose sight of the fact that\r\ntheir contributions to peace, security and development\r\ncan bring more legitimacy to the body. The time is ripe\r\nto welcome those countries in an enlarged and more\r\nrepresentative Security Council, in which Africa should\r\nhave at least two permanent seats.\r\nBeing a member of the Community of Portuguese\r\nSpeaking Countries (CPLP), Brazil should, in our view,\r\ntake a permanent seat in the Council.\r\nThe issues relating to the reform of the United\r\nNations have been the subject of a longstanding debate\r\nthat points to an overwhelming consensus among\r\nMember States. My delegation supports the proposals\r\nmade by the Secretary-General and hopes that the\r\nmomentum provided by acknowledgement of the\r\nchallenges, threats and dangers faced by the world will\r\nbe seized by this Assembly and instil its members with\r\nthe sense of urgency to come up with appropriate\r\nbinding and pragmatic decisions relating to these\r\nissues.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nAs the President of the Assembly rightly pointed\r\nout in his inaugural speech, “Many developing\r\ncountries do not have a wide range of development\r\nchoices available to them and in fact face serious\r\nchallenges due to their special circumstances.”\r\nAmong these developing countries the\r\ninternational community recognized small island\r\ndeveloping states as a special case of development and\r\nenvironment. It will be during the mandate of the\r\ncurrent President of the General Assembly that, by\r\nhappy coincidence, an international meeting will be\r\nheld in Mauritius to assess the state of implementation\r\nof the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nEarlier this month, Cape Verde hosted the second\r\nregional preparatory meeting in anticipation of the\r\nMauritius event. In this context, I would like to\r\nunderline the meaning of my country’s commitment to\r\nthe process of global support to the sustainable\r\ndevelopment of small island developing states, a\r\nprocess to which my Government is fully dedicated.\r\nThe SIDS denomination has now been in\r\nexistence for nearly a decade. The work accomplished\r\nby the United Nations toward a greater international\r\nawareness of the problems of small island developing\r\nstates has been generally successful.\r\nI take this opportunity to express my\r\nGovernment’s gratitude to the entire United Nations\r\nsystem for the central role it has played in cultivating\r\nand maintaining the high degree of international\r\nawareness that is essential to our countries.\r\nHowever, the recognition of a special category of\r\ncountries cannot be justified for the purposes of\r\nclassification alone. One would expect that the special\r\ndesignation would lead to some minimal amount of\r\nspecial treatment of the countries concerned,\r\ncommensurate with their specific disadvantages and\r\nhandicaps. Regrettably that is not the case with the\r\nsmall island developing states. In fact, island-specific\r\nspecial treatment is almost non-existent, even though\r\nmany SIDS are in dire need of greater differentiation in\r\nthe current pattern of international cooperation.\r\nI therefore wish to convey my Government’s\r\nhope that the Barbados Programme of Action +10\r\nprocess, culminating in the Mauritius international\r\nmeeting, will constitute a landmark in the history of the\r\ndifferentiated treatment of developing countries,\r\nparticularly small island developing States.\r\nThe need for special consideration that is most\r\ncommonly shared by small island developing states is\r\nthe need to see market-access preferences preserved,\r\nnot eroded. Such a need is not a luxury, but a\r\nprerequisite for many SIDS in their efforts to maintain\r\ncompetitiveness and economic viability in response to\r\nthe structural disadvantages resulting from their\r\nremoteness and small size.\r\nWhile several SIDS do enjoy a fair amount of\r\nspecial treatment, such as the treatment derived from\r\nleast developed country (LDC), African, Caribbean and\r\nPacific States (ACP) or African Growth and\r\nOpportunity Act (AGOA) status, there are still areas of\r\ninternational cooperation in which the absence of\r\nreference to island status is difficult to understand. One\r\nof these areas — of direct relevance to the question of\r\ntrade preferences — is the ongoing debate in the World\r\nTrade Organization concerning the Work Programme\r\non Small Economies, a debate in which small island\r\ndeveloping states, regrettably, have not been able to\r\nadvocate their case under the SIDS designation.\r\nCape Verde has again been deemed to qualify for\r\ngraduation from least developed country (LDC) status\r\nunder the criteria and graduation rules used by the\r\nCommittee for Development Policy and the Economic\r\nand Social Council. As stressed by my delegation in\r\nthe substantive session of the Council in July, we feel\r\nthat a decision to graduate Cape Verde from least\r\ndeveloped country status at this juncture would give\r\nthe international community a gravely incorrect\r\nimpression of our structural progress and prosperity,\r\nwhereas Cape Verde remains one of the most\r\neconomically vulnerable and aid-dependent countries\r\nin the world.\r\nHere we are faced with a peculiar paradox: in the\r\ncontext of its support to small island developing states\r\nthe United Nations system recognizes the permanent\r\nhandicaps of a country, but, at the same time, it is\r\nconsidering withdrawing the special treatment this\r\ncountry has been eligible for, without leaving any\r\nalternative treatment available.\r\nIn this context, and in the light of the\r\ninternational recognition of the special handicaps of\r\nsmall island developing states, my Government urges\r\nthe General Assembly to request the relevant bodies of\r\nthe United Nations system to re-examine with care the\r\nrule whereby a least developed country would be seen\r\nas qualifying for graduation. We believe that such re-\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nexamination ought to result in a methodological reform\r\nthat will do justice to the least developed small island\r\ndeveloping States.\r\nAfrica has made a remarkable effort to respond\r\npositively to the call of the international community\r\nand its own peoples to foster development, promote\r\ndemocracy, transparency, good governance, the rule of\r\nlaw and accountability. In the wake of this call African\r\nleaders agreed to establish the New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), in whose success we\r\nare all engaged in order to lead our continent out of\r\npoverty and conflict, ushering in a new era of\r\nprosperity and peace. Its adoption not only by the\r\nAfrican Governments and civil societies but also by the\r\ninternational community as a framework for African\r\ndevelopment will help establish common goals and\r\nclear commitments that will lead our continent on a\r\npromising new journey. We believe that the NEPAD\r\nproject should pay special attention to the situation of\r\nthe island States.\r\nNoticeable progress has been achieved, both in\r\nthe manner of installing democratic Governments\r\nthroughout the continent and in putting an end to\r\nconflicts.\r\nIn this particular case, we are heartened by the\r\nrecent accord between the Sudanese Government and\r\nthe Sudan People’s Liberation Army. This constitutes a\r\nvery significant step towards putting an end to the\r\nsuffering of the Sudanese people. If, as we all\r\nanxiously hope, this agreement brings peace to that\r\ngreat African nation, it will add to the successes\r\nalready registered in Mozambique, Angola and Sierra\r\nLeone, along with the ongoing processes in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Great Lakes\r\nand Liberia.\r\nWe must be cautious, however. Conflicts result\r\nfrom unsettled social and political issues. If these are\r\nnot adequately tackled, the risk of new conflicts will\r\npersist. It is important to recall that democracy and the\r\nrule of law can develop unhindered only when and if\r\nthe minimum conditions for survival are assured for the\r\npopulations and when the rights of individuals and\r\ngroups, including minorities, are respected.\r\nThe events in Guinea-Bissau two weeks ago\r\nillustrate the fragility of the institutions in a country\r\nthat cannot address the basic problems of its\r\npopulation. While it may be true that political leaders\r\nmust be held accountable for not ensuring good\r\ngovernance, in an environment of poverty, lack of\r\nresources and indebtedness good governance is easily\r\nset aside. These events point to the need for a stronger\r\ncommitment of the international community to helping\r\ncountries in distress face the tasks of fighting poverty,\r\nconsolidating democratic institutions and promoting\r\neconomic and social development not only with\r\npromises and advice, but also with concrete means.\r\nNotwithstanding the serious threats that hover\r\nover mankind, a safer, more just and more peaceful\r\nworld is now within reach of our living generations.\r\nNever before has mankind had such an array of means\r\nto face the great challenges that continue to defy\r\nhumankind, such as hunger, poverty, illiteracy and\r\ncurable diseases. Hunger is a case in point. Several\r\nexperiences in different regions of the world prove that\r\nhunger can be eliminated if there is determination and\r\navailable resources. It is therefore unacceptable that, in\r\na world awash with food, one in three sub-Saharan\r\nAfricans should continue to suffer from chronic hunger.\r\nLast July, at the second ordinary session of the\r\nAssembly of the African Union, held in Maputo,\r\nMozambique, heads of State and Government of the\r\nAfrican Union adopted a Declaration on Agriculture\r\nand Food Security in Africa. In this Declaration,\r\nAfrican leaders once again demonstrated their firm\r\ncommitment to combating hunger on the African\r\ncontinent.\r\nAt the national level, fighting hunger was set as\r\none of the main priorities of the first Government of\r\nCape Verde immediately after independence and\r\ncontinues to have a prominent place in Government\r\npolicies in the framework of poverty reduction\r\nstrategies. That is why we support the plea made by the\r\nPresident of Brazil to establish a world committee to\r\nfight hunger.\r\nThree years ago, world leaders endowed\r\nthemselves with the important political tool that is the\r\nMillennium Declaration. There is no excuse for the fact\r\nthat the promised resources and the proclaimed will\r\nhave not been put to work to achieve and even surpass\r\nthe arduously negotiated but unanimously agreed Goals\r\nadopted in this very Hall. Despite the difficulties and\r\nuncertainties looming over the Organization, the eyes\r\nof the world are focused on the United Nations because\r\nall believe that our Organization can and should be the\r\nvehicle for achieving those Goals. Let us work together\r\nto make it happen.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): I give\r\nthe floor to His Excellency Mr. Harmodio Arias,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nPanama.\r\nMr. Arias (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the President of the Republic of Panama,\r\nMireya Elisa Moscoso Rodríguez, and on my own\r\nbehalf, I extend my warmest congratulations to Mr.\r\nHunte on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at this session. The delegation of Panama is\r\ndeeply gratified that he has been appointed to guide our\r\ndebates, because he represents here the commitment of\r\ndeveloping countries, and in particular those of the\r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States, to\r\nmultilateral efforts to achieve peace, respect for human\r\nrights, and sustainable development.\r\nStability and security, in their broadest sense, are\r\nthings to which all humanity aspires. We will never\r\nachieve these objectives, however, if, in attempting to\r\nshape this new world, we counter the aspirations of our\r\npeoples or attempt to base it on the systematic\r\ndevelopment of grand military alliances. Human\r\nsecurity, which is sought by all States, large and small,\r\ndepends exclusively on our dedication to the collective\r\nsecurity architecture that we have concentrated in the\r\nUnited Nations. Our duty, then, is to defend and\r\nstrengthen at all costs our Organization’s objectives\r\nand purposes, in particular the integrity and authority\r\nof our international legal system.\r\nThe world has been through an extraordinary\r\nexperience this year, one that was hotly debated and the\r\nfallout from which is still far from clear. It is not too\r\nmuch to say that the trepidations over the events in Iraq\r\nthat were felt here in the United Nations and beyond\r\nhave had a number of repercussions both on the\r\ninternal work of this Organization and on the conduct\r\nof international relations.\r\nNevertheless, Panama is convinced that the\r\ndifferences that were aired in the Security Council are\r\na clear demonstration that it has functioned as it\r\nshould; that the diversity of opinions and approaches\r\nthat exist in the world were aired there without\r\nreservations; and that, although differences remained at\r\nthe end of the process, it had the marginal benefit of\r\nhighlighting the measurement and control requirements\r\nthat must be taken into account in the Security Council.\r\nApart from these differences, the Security\r\nCouncil acted appropriately in establishing a pragmatic\r\nrelationship with the occupying Powers in Iraq by\r\nmeans of resolution 1483 (2003) of May 22. In\r\naddition, our Organization is demonstrating that it has\r\nan irreplaceable role to play in the humanitarian field,\r\njust as it has in the political, diplomatic, economic and\r\nfinancial spheres.\r\nThe shocking slaughter that took place in\r\nBaghdad on 19 August and the killings of 22\r\nSeptember — painful acts of terrorism that took the\r\nlives of many national and international civil servants\r\nof the United Nations, including Special Representative\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello — must move us to consider\r\nand adopt urgent measures to ensure that the\r\ninternational community takes concerted action as soon\r\nas possible towards the reconstruction of Iraq. To all\r\ntheir colleagues and to the great United Nations family,\r\nwe express the most sincere condolences of Mireya\r\nMoscoso, President of Panama, her Government and\r\nthe people of Panama.\r\nDuring the Millennium Summit, Panama asked\r\nMember States, among other things, to return to the\r\noriginal spirit of the United Nations Charter. Consistent\r\nwith that request, we hope that all of us will accept the\r\nobligation to reconcile ourselves with the general\r\ninterests of the international community and to avoid\r\nacting solely in light of our particular strategic,\r\nmilitary or political interests.\r\nWe repeat that request today, and call attention to\r\nthe urgent need for strengthening the multilateral\r\nsystem as the guarantee of stability and security, which\r\nare fundamental for peaceful coexistence. Today,\r\nperhaps more than ever before, we must tackle the task\r\nof reforming our Organization so that the General\r\nAssembly can fulfil its proper function as the principal\r\npolitical body, and the Security Council can have a\r\ngreater capacity to deal with the new challenges that\r\nthe end of the cold war has brought with it.\r\nTo achieve this objective, Panama stresses the\r\ncontents of the Declaration on the Strengthening of the\r\nUnited Nations and Security Council Reform, adopted\r\nat the Eleventh Summit of Heads of State and\r\nGovernment of the Rio Group, which met at Asunción,\r\nParaguay, in August 1997, calling upon Member States\r\nof the United Nations to correct the present imbalances\r\nin the composition of the Security Council, improve its\r\ndecision-making mechanisms, and bring greater\r\ntransparency to the conduct of its work.\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nWe firmly believe that an extremely important\r\nelement in this and other tasks facing us is the\r\nannouncement by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\r\nthat he will establish a high-level panel comprising\r\neminent personalities from all regions of the world.\r\nPanama and the world congratulate him on having\r\nproposed this initiative.\r\nWe also wish to have the General Assembly\r\nbecome the forum in which to seek a solution to the\r\nproblem between the People’s Republic of China and\r\nTaiwan. As Panama has noted on previous occasions,\r\nTaiwan has, in a sense, been left hanging in time and\r\nspace, protected and yet unprotected. Recently, in\r\nresponse to the need to combat the severe acute\r\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, the World\r\nHealth Organization was able to provide direct and\r\neffective assistance to Taiwan without violating or\r\nweakening the fundamental elements of the positions\r\nof the parties to that controversy. We believe that the\r\nUnited Nations system could act in several ways to\r\nhelp the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan\r\nresolve their dispute in a peaceful way, while we fulfil\r\nour most cherished objective of responding, without\r\nexception, to the social needs of humanity.\r\nLast July we held here the first Biennial Meeting\r\nof States to Consider the Implementation of the 2001\r\nProgramme of Action on Small Arms and Light\r\nWeapons in All Its Aspects. We are still quite far from\r\nachieving our objectives, both nationally and\r\ninternationally, but we believe that that biennial\r\nmeeting injected new vigour into the efforts that we\r\nmust all make to keep our commitments.\r\nWe repeat our position, put forward at that\r\nmeeting, that the purposes and code of conduct put\r\nbefore Member States in the first two articles of the\r\nCharter must be crucial for securing peace and\r\nunderstanding among the nations of the world.\r\nWe would also stress that the massive clandestine\r\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons, which\r\nfuels internal conflicts, dictatorships, guerrilla\r\nmovements and international terrorism, can only be\r\nblocked through close international cooperation. With\r\nequal determination, we must pursue the networks of\r\ntraffickers in narcotics and diamonds, which use bogus\r\nfirms and banks, thrive by corrupting public officials\r\nand are constantly working to destroy our societies.\r\nIn a follow-up to the Monterrey Summit, we in\r\nthe countries of the South renew our call for creating a\r\nmore just and efficient financial system, for eliminating\r\nthe inequities of globalization and financing for\r\ndevelopment, and for raising the depressed prices of\r\nour raw materials and other export products. As we\r\nhave stated on previous occasions, there is also an\r\nurgent need to agree on the proper mechanisms for\r\nforestalling financial crises and finding a solution to\r\nunsustainable external debt burdens, in accordance\r\nwith resolution 57/240.\r\nWe now approach the High-level Dialogue on\r\nFinancing for Development, which will be held in this\r\ncity on 29 and 30 October 2003. We must seize this\r\nopportunity to reinvigorate this part of our activity, and\r\nto review the progress achieved in ensuring effective\r\nSecretariat support, pursuant to resolution 57/273.\r\nAt the second meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee\r\nto consider proposals for a comprehensive and integral\r\ninternational convention to promote and protect the\r\nrights and dignity of persons with disabilities, it was\r\ndecided to create a working group to prepare and\r\nsubmit a draft text for negotiation among Member\r\nStates and accredited observers.\r\nPanama’s position is represented in the\r\nDeclaration of Quito of 11 April 2003, which, in brief,\r\ncalled for promoting and protecting the rights and\r\ndignity of the 600 million persons living with\r\ndisabilities around the world, the great majority of\r\nwhom suffer constantly from poverty and lack of\r\nunderstanding. The international convention that we\r\nseek, as noted in the Declaration, must reflect “the\r\nuniversality, indivisibility and interdependence of all\r\nhuman rights and the principle of non-discrimination.”\r\nThese concepts are thoroughly established in the\r\nUnited Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights, international human rights agreements\r\nand other related instruments.\r\nIt is timely to refer here to the persistent and\r\ngrowing worldwide HIV/AIDS pandemic. Latin\r\nAmerican and Caribbean countries, too, are confronted\r\nwith a serious situation in this area. The Pan American\r\nHealth Organization met in Washington on 11 June to\r\naddress this issue, and noted that the demographic and\r\nsocial impact of HIV/AIDS in our region threatens to\r\nundermine the ability to carry out development\r\nprojects.\r\nWe therefore call on the United Nations system to\r\nmake available to Latin America and the Caribbean\r\nadequate resources to prevent this scourge. As is well\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nknown, our region today has some 2.5 million people\r\nsuffering from this terrible disease.\r\nIt is clear that the moral and technical presence of\r\nthe United Nations is essential in efforts to eradicate\r\npolitical, racial and religious intolerance, and in\r\nsupport of negotiations for pacification, reunification,\r\nself-determination and reconstruction, in order to\r\nensure that the peoples concerned can enjoy the\r\nbenefits of development.\r\nHaving said this, I urge our Organization to find\r\nexpeditious ways of helping those who are committed\r\nto the so-called road map for resolving the conflict\r\nbetween Palestine and Israel to secure the active\r\ncooperation of the countries of the region and of the\r\nGovernments of Israel and the Palestine National\r\nAuthority, so as to overcome the current scepticism\r\nover any imminent possibility of seeing the two\r\npeoples living in peace, within secure boundaries, as\r\ntwo sovereign States.\r\nEnsuring that that urgent task is carried out\r\nsuccessfully will require the ongoing participation of\r\nall of the neighbouring States. They must demonstrate\r\na joint willingness to become guarantors of the stability\r\nand security of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and\r\nguardians of strict adherence to the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations and to Security Council resolutions.\r\nI would like to conclude by referring briefly to\r\nthe International Criminal Court. With the election of\r\nits Judges and Prosecutor, the Court has become a\r\nreality. We recognize the concern that has been\r\naroused, particularly among the States parties to the\r\nRome Statute, by the fact that the Security Council, in\r\nits resolution 1487 (2003), renewed for one year the\r\nprovisions of resolution 1422 (2002) with regard to\r\nimmunity in cases relating to peacekeeping operations,\r\nas well as by the fact that bilateral immunity\r\nagreements have been negotiated separately by several\r\ncountries on the basis of article 98 of the Statute.\r\nPanama, a firm supporter of the International\r\nCriminal Court, believes that these pragmatic\r\nagreements are a response to a temporary situation, and\r\nthat they cannot and must not detract from the purposes\r\nand objectives of the Rome Statute. As States parties,\r\nwe cannot shrink from the obligations imposed by our\r\ndomestic jurisdictions in matters relating to war\r\ncrimes, and we are therefore convinced that the\r\npolitical concerns and suspicions of today will\r\ndisappear as it becomes apparent that persons who\r\ncommit monstrous crimes against humanity can never\r\nbe shielded by any State or protected by dreams of\r\nimpunity. Any State that holds to a different\r\ninterpretation on this point will be swimming against\r\nthe tide of human progress and international law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Mustafa Osman\r\nIsmail, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\r\nthe Sudan.\r\nMr. Ismail (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I should\r\nlike to begin my statement with a quotation from the\r\nKoran:\r\n“O mankind! We created\r\nYou from a single (pair)\r\nOf a male and a female,\r\nAnd made you into\r\nNations and tribes, that\r\nYe may know each other\r\n(Not that ye may despise\r\n(Each other). Verily\r\nThe most honoured of you in the sight of Allah\r\nIs (he who is) the most\r\nRighteous of you.” (The Holy Koran, XLIX:13)\r\nPeace be upon you.\r\nI should like at the outset to congratulate Mr.\r\nJulian Hunte on his well-deserved election to the\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at this session. I\r\nshould also like to express the gratitude of my\r\ndelegation to his predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation for the\r\nimportant role that the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, continues to play in revitalizing the\r\nwork of the Organization. In this connection, we\r\nwelcome his ideas regarding the institutional reform of\r\nthe Organization. I would also like to take this\r\nopportunity to express to the United Nations our\r\nheartfelt condolences for the untimely deaths of Mr.\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues.\r\nWhen I addressed the Assembly from this\r\nrostrum last year, I made clear that my Government\r\nand my country were eager to achieve peace in the\r\nSudan. I am very pleased, therefore, to inform the\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nAssembly that our words have been matched with\r\ndeeds, and peace is now on the horizon — peace that\r\nwill put an end to an armed conflict that has\r\nsquandered the human and natural resources of the\r\ncountry and hindered the development of the Sudanese\r\npeople.\r\nMy country has continuously reiterated its desire\r\nfor dialogue and negotiation with the Sudan People’s\r\nLiberation Army Movement (SPLM). Our efforts,\r\ntogether with those of the mediators, have been\r\ncontinuing for more than 10 years and have recently\r\nbeen crowned with success in the form of an agreement\r\nby both parties as a result of an initiative put forward\r\nby the countries of the Inter-Governmental Authority\r\non Development, under the patronage of the sisterly\r\ncountry, Kenya, and with much appreciated positive\r\nsupport by the IGAD partners.\r\nAt the most recent round of negotiations, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, First Vice-\r\nPresident, led the Government delegation, and Mr. John\r\nGarang led the SPLM delegation. Four days ago, it\r\nresulted in an agreement on security arrangements and\r\nthe extension of a ceasefire. It is expected that that\r\nagreement will pave the way for a final round of\r\nnegotiations that will lead to just and lasting peace\r\nthroughout the Sudan as soon as possible.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express\r\nour gratitude to the IGAD member countries for the\r\nrole they played in the Sudan peace process, under the\r\nstewardship of the President of Kenya and his special\r\nenvoy. Our thanks and appreciation also go to IGAD\r\npartners, namely the United States of America, the\r\nUnited Kingdom, Italy and Norway. We would like to\r\nexpress particular gratitude for the positive\r\nintervention of the Government of the United States of\r\nAmerica at the most critical juncture in the negotiation\r\nprocess. We also appreciate the considerable efforts\r\nthat Egypt and Libya have continued to make in the\r\ninterests of peace in the Sudan, as well as those of the\r\nArab League and the African Union.\r\nWe are confident that Members will understand\r\nhow important the ceasefire agreement is for the\r\nhumanitarian situation. The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the humanitarian situation in the Sudan\r\ndemonstrates the extent of the progress made in this\r\narea. Next month will mark the one-year anniversary of\r\nthe cessation of hostilities. Peace remains a basic\r\nrequirement for the rehabilitation of the areas affected\r\nby war and will allow for the transition from\r\nhumanitarian relief to comprehensive sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Ekua Avomo (Equatorial Guinea), Vice-\r\nPresident, took the Chair.\r\nWe would like to reiterate our full conviction that\r\nthe peace, security and stability of the countries of the\r\nregion are directly linked with peace in the Sudan. That\r\nis why my country has endeavoured to heal the wounds\r\nof the past in its relations with neighbouring countries,\r\nin particular Egypt and Ethiopia. Our relationship with\r\nthose two countries has moved beyond the\r\nreconciliation stage; we now have exemplary strategic\r\nsecurity ties with them, thereby protecting the interests\r\nof our peoples and consolidating peace and security in\r\nthe entire region.\r\nWe would like to express gratitude to our friends\r\nand brothers and to the United Nations in general for\r\ntheir humanitarian assistance during the conflict. We\r\ncall upon the international community to help in the\r\npost-conflict reconstruction of our country and the\r\nrehabilitation of internally displaced persons and\r\nrefugees, and to assist in the achievement of\r\nsustainable development in support of the fledgling\r\npeace.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to tell the Assembly\r\nthat we have made appreciable constitutional\r\nachievements that will open the door wide for\r\nparticipation by all the Sudanese people in all areas of\r\npolitical life. Economic plans and policies adopted by\r\nthe Government have started to bear fruit, whether in\r\nthe form of reduced levels of inflation, high rates of\r\ngrowth or the stabilization of exchange rates. We will\r\ncontinue to enhance those policies with a view to\r\nreducing poverty and achieving sustainable\r\ndevelopment within the framework of the 25-year\r\ncomprehensive development strategy for the period\r\n2003-2027.\r\nIn his report on the work of the Organization, the\r\nSecretary-General reminded us that, as the challenges\r\nfacing us change, so must we alter our methods of\r\ndealing with them. It is high time, therefore, that we\r\nsummon the political will to reform the Security\r\nCouncil by dealing with the double issues of\r\nmembership and the right of veto so as to make it more\r\nrepresentative and democratic in its membership and in\r\nits decision-making. While touching on Security\r\nCouncil reform, we warmly welcome Council\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nresolution 1506 (2003), which lifted the sanctions\r\nimposed against fraternal Libya. In that connection, we\r\nwish to stress the need to lift all unilateral sanctions,\r\nused as a means for the political and economic\r\ncoercion of States. We urge the Security Council not to\r\nbe quick to impose sanctions on countries, particularly\r\nthe developing countries, because of their adverse\r\nimpact on their people.\r\nThe high-level participation at this session to\r\ndiscuss various international issues is clear evidence of\r\nthe General Assembly’s importance. We strongly\r\nsupport its efforts to rearrange its priorities and agenda\r\nitems, in order to improve the administrative and\r\nprocedural aspects of its work, to enhance its relations\r\nwith the Security Council, the highest organ in the\r\nUnited Nations, to contribute to the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security and to face ongoing\r\nchallenges.\r\nAnother challenge of great concern to us lately is\r\nthe increasing acts of terrorism. Terrorist acts that\r\noccurred in various parts of the world last year clearly\r\nprove that no country is immune to terrorism. All of us,\r\nregardless of our religion or beliefs, could be the\r\nvictims of such crimes. As I mentioned earlier,\r\nterrorism has no religion or country. Hence, in order to\r\nface this grave threat, we need to reach an international\r\nconsensus on its definition, root causes and means to\r\ncombat it, under the auspices of our international\r\nOrganization.\r\nIn that context, we express our support for the\r\ncall of His Excellency Mohamed Hosni Mubarak,\r\nPresident of the Arab Republic of Egypt, to convene an\r\ninternational conference, under the auspices of the\r\nUnited Nations, to address the issue of terrorism. In the\r\ncontext of its international and regional role, the Sudan\r\nwill have the honour next year to host the Non-Aligned\r\nMovement ministerial conference. We hope that the\r\nconference will consider issues of collective security\r\nand challenges.\r\nThe deteriorating socio-economic situation of the\r\nleast developed countries requires the international\r\ncommunity to make every effort to extricate them from\r\nthe labyrinth of poverty, hunger and disease. Our\r\nexperience in the Sudan has proved that, regardless of\r\ntheir endeavours, the least developed countries cannot\r\nachieve the objectives of the Brussels Programme of\r\nAction without substantial assistance from their\r\ndevelopment partners. I commend the tireless efforts of\r\nthe High Representative of the Secretary-General for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries in mobilizing\r\ninternational support for initiatives on the subject. We\r\njoin the appeal to the international community by His\r\nExcellency Joaquim Alberto Chissano, President of\r\nMozambique, as Chairman of the African Union, to\r\nextend support and assistance to the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the framework\r\nadopted by the African continent and endorsed by the\r\nUnited Nations and donor countries as a tool for coping\r\nwith development challenges in the continent.\r\nI am pleased to inform members that the Sudan,\r\nas Chairman of the Intergovernmental Authority on\r\nDevelopment (IGAD) and Common Market for Eastern\r\nand Southern Africa (COMESA), has tried its best to\r\nformulate policies and take steps that will further\r\nconsolidate and promote links of cooperation between\r\nEGAD and COMESA member States. Such efforts are\r\nin line with the NEPAD initiative aimed at achieving\r\npeace, development and prosperity for the peoples of\r\nthe entire African continent. To that end, a number of\r\nspecialized conferences have been convened in the\r\nSudan to address issues of economic cooperation,\r\ndisarmament and combating terrorism, as well as issues\r\nof internally displaced persons and refugees, all with\r\nthe aim of attaining the NEPAD goals.\r\nAnother agenda item subject that we think will\r\nnegatively impact the future of humankind if not\r\nproperly addressed is that of human cloning, which is\r\nnow at the centre of a heated scientific, religious, legal\r\nand ethical debate. The Sudan strongly supports the\r\ncall for an international convention against the\r\nreproductive cloning of human beings. We also\r\ncondemn all medical ventures that disdain human\r\ndignity and the sanctity of the Creator.\r\nStatements over the past few days clearly\r\ndemonstrate the keen interest of the international\r\ncommunity in maintaining international peace and\r\nsecurity. While adding our voice to those calling for the\r\nrevitalization of multilateral diplomacy, we also call\r\nfor the prompt handling of the critical security and\r\nhumanitarian situation in Iraq. Furthermore, we call for\r\nthe empowerment of our Iraqi brothers so that they\r\nmay exercise their right to sovereignty, as guaranteed\r\nto them by international law, and live in peace and\r\nharmony with their neighbours. It gives me pleasure to\r\nremind the Assembly of the important resolution\r\nadopted a few weeks ago by the Council of Ministers\r\nof the League of Arab States, which recognized the\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\ntransitional Governing Council of Iraq. Such\r\nrecognition is a significant step that will, hopefully,\r\nenable Iraq to regain its sovereignty and to play its\r\nregional and international role.\r\nThe question of Palestine has been a deep\r\nconcern to the human conscience. For more than five\r\ndecades, it has been a major threat to international\r\npeace and security. We have been firmly convinced that\r\nIsrael’s maintenance of a huge military presence, its\r\naggression and its killing and suppression of the\r\nPalestinian people, will only aggravate a situation that\r\nis already deteriorating. The only viable way to achieve\r\npeace is to adhere to the relevant resolutions of\r\ninternational legitimacy and international law. The\r\ninternational community, particularly the influential\r\nparties in the peace process, are urged to exert pressure\r\non Israel.\r\nThe conflict in Somalia has been a bleeding\r\nwound in the Horn of Africa and the time has come to\r\nstop that painful bleeding. We call upon the leaders of\r\nall Somali factions to join hands to preserve the unity\r\nand stability of their country, and to achieve\r\ndevelopment and prosperity for their people, in order to\r\nprotect them from the scourge of war and fighting. We\r\nremain confident that the neighbouring and other\r\ninterested countries will spare no effort to help reach\r\nan agreement that will preserve the unity, security and\r\nstability of Somalia.\r\nThe Sudan is now a genuine partner in the\r\ninternational efforts aimed at the prohibition of\r\nchemical weapons. One of the significant roles played\r\nby the Sudan in that regard was its hosting last August\r\nof the First Conference of the African National\r\nAuthorities of the Chemical Weapons Convention\r\nStates Parties. We are committed to implementing the\r\nrecommendations adopted at the conference,\r\nparticularly to creating a chemical-weapon-free zone in\r\nAfrica and to enhancing international cooperation in\r\nthe peaceful use of chemical materials.\r\nI call upon the international community to make\r\nrenewed efforts to declare the Middle East a zone free\r\nof nuclear weapons and of all other weapons of mass\r\ndestruction. That inflamed region must abide by\r\ninternational agreements banning nuclear weapons. The\r\nnuclear facilities of all States, without exception and\r\nwith complete fairness, must be subjected to the\r\ncomprehensive safeguards of the International Atomic\r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA).\r\nHere we recall, shortly after its fifth anniversary,\r\nthe unjust bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical and\r\nveterinary factory by the former United States\r\nAdministration which claimed that it was used to\r\nmanufacture weapons. It was a baseless accusation, as\r\nMembers are aware, that has been refuted by American\r\nscientific and academic institutions before relevant\r\ninternational organizations. The Sudan’s complaint is\r\nstill alive in the Security Council. In that connection, I\r\ncall upon the current United States Administration to\r\nrectify the serious mistake that it inherited from its\r\npredecessor, by compensating the Sudan morally and\r\nfinancially.\r\nI hope that before the end of this session my\r\ncountry will finally bid farewell to the longest African\r\nconflict, an achievement that would enable the Sudan\r\nto play its role at the regional level and to contribute to\r\nthe stability and sustainable development of the\r\nAfrican continent.\r\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm our deep conviction that\r\nthe United Nations is the sole, irreplaceable mechanism\r\nfor administering and promoting international\r\ncooperation in all fields. Therefore, we should distance\r\nthe United Nations from serving narrow interests and\r\nfrom attempts to exploit it to pursue special agendas. In\r\nthat connection, we express our readiness and our\r\ncommitment to assist the United Nations system in\r\nachieving the lofty goals enshrined in the Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Marwan Muasher, Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Hashemite Kingdom of\r\nJordan.\r\nMr. Muasher (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): Let me\r\nbegin by expressing warm congratulations to Mr. Julian\r\nHunte on his election as President of the General\r\nAssembly at its fifty-eighth session. I can assure him of\r\nthe full cooperation of the Jordanian delegation to\r\nensure the fulfilment of his mandate for the benefit of\r\nall peoples and nations. I should also like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our thanks and appreciation to\r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his remarkable\r\nstewardship of the previous session.\r\nA special tribute is due to the Secretary-General,\r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for his efforts dedicated to upholding\r\nthe lofty goals of the Organization. Mr. Annan has been\r\nquite dynamic in his work to enhance this world body’s\r\neffectiveness and to revitalize its functions, especially\r\nin the areas of international peace and security, human\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nrights and social and economic progress throughout the\r\nworld.\r\nI wish to express our heartfelt condolences to the\r\nSecretary-General as well as to the family of Mr.\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello and to those of all his\r\ncolleagues who lost their lives as a result of the\r\nterrorist bombing of the United Nations headquarters in\r\nIraq, a barbaric act that we all condemn.\r\nThe sad collapse of the Oslo process\r\ndemonstrated that a revival of the Middle East peace\r\nprocess under the previous terms was no longer a\r\nviable option. Peace-making in the region requires a\r\nnew modus operandi, as all transitional arrangements\r\nhave failed to establish and build mutual confidence\r\nbetween the two sides and to meet the envisioned\r\ngoals. Thus, the time has indeed come for a shift in\r\napproach. Instead of managing the conflict in a way\r\nthat has led thus far to a perpetuation of the cycle of\r\nviolence, our focus should be redirected onto the final\r\nobjectives of the negotiations. Furthermore, it is no\r\nlonger useful to concentrate only on security aspects\r\nwithout realizing that the problem is essentially\r\npolitical in nature and not only a question of security.\r\nIt was against that backdrop that George W. Bush,\r\nPresident of the United States, launched in June 2002\r\nhis vision for peace in the Middle East. On the basis of\r\nthat initiative, the road map was formulated and\r\nannounced. Jordan contributed to the development of\r\nthe road map, which generated a real turnaround in the\r\nregion’s political landscape. It established a framework\r\nof mutual obligations, whose aim is to end the Israeli\r\noccupation and to establish an independent Palestinian\r\nstate on the basis of relevant United Nations\r\nresolutions and the Arab peace initiative. The road map\r\nset forth a specific three-year time frame for the birth\r\nof a Palestinian State. Furthermore, it provided for the\r\ncreation of a monitoring and assessment mechanism to\r\nensure viable implementation according to specific\r\ntimelines.\r\nIt was on the basis of that vision that the\r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan welcomed the road map\r\nwhen it was formally announced by the Quartet. At the\r\ntime, we expressed the hope that that impetus would\r\nhelp to restart the peace process on a solid foundation.\r\nHowever, Jordan also made it clear that the declaration\r\nin and of itself would be insufficient to create forward\r\nmovement towards our objectives. What was\r\nadditionally required was a genuine commitment on the\r\npart of the United States and the international\r\ncommunity to implement that vision. True to our\r\nexpectations, we sensed such a genuine commitment at\r\nthe two recent Sharm al-Sheikh and Aqaba summits.\r\nJordan, in the meantime, fully recognizes that\r\nrecent developments on the ground — especially the\r\ncollapse of the ceasefire, or hudna, arrangement\r\nbetween the Palestinian groups and Israel — create\r\nsevere and real risks and threats for the road map.\r\nNonetheless, we should stay the course with a view to\r\nimplementing the road map and putting an end to the\r\noccupation and the tragic killing of civilians on both\r\nthe Palestinian and Israeli sides. The hard work that we\r\nare investing in this exercise is worthwhile given the\r\npotential risk of failure and the absence of political\r\nopportunity again. Such failure would make for a more\r\ndangerous and complex scenario than before and would\r\njeopardize the interests and security of all actors.\r\nOn behalf of Jordan, I wish to urge from this\r\nworld podium all stakeholders — especially the\r\nmembers of the Quartet — to pursue their efforts to\r\nensure scrupulous implementation of the road map,\r\nwithout any modifications and in a way that guarantees\r\nby 2005 the establishment of a Palestinian State, with\r\nJerusalem as its capital, and the termination of the\r\nIsraeli occupation of all Arab territories occupied in\r\n1967. All that would be in keeping with the relevant\r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the Arab peace\r\ninitiative, which is a key component of the road map\r\nand provides a framework for peace — a peace that is\r\nacceptable to all peoples of the region and fulfils their\r\nlong-standing aspirations.\r\nAlong the same lines, we urge acceleration in the\r\ncreation of an effective political and security\r\nmonitoring mechanism to be operated by the Quartet.\r\nThat is essential to ensure strict implementation of, and\r\ncompliance with, without modifications, the respective\r\nobligations of both parties as set forth in the road map.\r\nTo us, such a mechanism is an essential component on\r\nwhich we must insist, because we consider it to be a\r\ntrue point of departure that would enable us to take\r\nadvantage of the historic window of opportunity and\r\nbring about comprehensive, just and lasting peace in\r\nthe entire Middle East.\r\nRegarding suicide attacks, I wish to reiterate that\r\nJordan took a principled position repudiating and\r\ncondemning such acts on both moral and political\r\ngrounds. We maintain that those operations have done\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nharm to the Palestinian cause and have resulted in the\r\nerosion of international sympathy for it. Furthermore,\r\nthey have shifted the global focus away from the core\r\nquestion of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian\r\nterritories and the pressing need to end that occupation.\r\nAlong the same lines, we condemn Israel’s\r\nextrajudicial killing of Palestinian citizens. Let me\r\nstress once again that the prevailing atmosphere of\r\nviolence will only play into the hands of extremists on\r\nboth sides of the divide. Therefore, it is high time to\r\nimplement the road map as accepted by all parties and\r\nto take bold and expeditious steps to place the entire\r\npeace process back on an irreversible track.\r\nWe call upon Israel to change its current security\r\npolicy, which has failed to ensure security for the\r\nIsraelis. Rather, Israel should move towards restoration\r\nof confidence with the Palestinian side partner side so\r\nthat both can focus on the political process by engaging\r\nin a serious implementation of the road map. To this\r\nend, Israel must ease the suffering of the Palestinian\r\npeople by lifting the closures on Palestinian\r\ncommunities, removing the restrictions imposed on the\r\nPalestinian leadership and by withdrawing its military\r\nforces from the cities occupied since September 2000,\r\nin compliance with Security Council resolution 1402\r\n(2002).\r\nIn the same context, my Government condemns\r\nthe decision taken by the Government of Israel to\r\nremove, in principle, from the occupied Palestinian\r\nterritories, the Palestinian President, Yasser Arafat,\r\nwho was legitimately elected by his people. In our\r\nview, this decision seriously imperils the peace\r\nprocess. We call on the Government of Israel to reverse\r\nits decision, which otherwise will plunge the entire\r\nregion into a dangerous tunnel.\r\nJordan condemns the Israeli settlement activities\r\nthat take the form of unabated construction of\r\nsettlements on occupied Palestinian land. Israel must\r\nend these activities, which breach the basic norms of\r\ninternational law and, not least, impede ongoing efforts\r\nto put the peace process back on track. We demand that\r\nthe Government of Israel start dismantling all\r\nsettlements erected since March 2001. This is, after all,\r\na binding obligation of Phase I of the road map.\r\nWe also condemn the separation wall, which\r\nconsolidates Israeli occupation of Palestinian\r\nterritories, devours further Palestinian land, aggravates\r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian population and\r\nanticipates as a fait accompli, the future shape of the\r\nPalestinian State. While we demand that Israel cease\r\nforthwith the construction of the wall, we stress the\r\nneed to respect the status of the 4 June 1967 line.\r\nIraq has now entered a new phase during which\r\nthe brotherly people of that country are facing\r\nenormous hardships and challenges. The eyes of all\r\nIraqis are now set on the international community in\r\nthe hope of receiving every possible assistance that\r\nwould enable them to lay a solid foundation for\r\nbuilding a promising future that would include\r\nreconstructing their country and regaining its status as\r\nan active member in the Organization and of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nWhile we emphasize the need to safeguard the\r\nunity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq, to\r\nensure the withdrawal of the foreign occupation forces\r\nas quickly as possible and to enable the people of Iraq\r\nto determine their future by themselves, we welcome\r\nthe formation of the transitional Governing Council as\r\na first and important step towards a broad-based Iraqi\r\nGovernment that represents the full spectrum of the\r\nIraqi population, to be elected by the people of Iraq as\r\nexpeditiously as possible on the basis of a constitution\r\naccepted and endorsed by them. Against this backdrop,\r\nwe decided to deal positively with the Governing\r\nCouncil and with all political groups in Iraq. Let me\r\nelaborate that my Government has accepted the\r\nassumption by the representatives of the transitional\r\nIraqi Government of the seat of Iraq in the League of\r\nArab States on a temporary basis, based on the\r\nunderstanding that Iraq will subsequently move\r\ntowards drafting its constitution and holding elections\r\nleading to the formation of a representative Iraqi\r\nGovernment.\r\nWe must also emphasize our condemnation of the\r\nviolations of human rights and international law\r\ncommitted by the previous regime in Iraq, especially\r\nthe crimes of assassination, mass killings and mass\r\nburials, including the execution of Kuwaiti prisoners\r\nand detainees.\r\nAt this juncture, I wish to underline the central\r\nrole the United Nations must continue to play in Iraq.\r\nThe United Nations should remain an active player in\r\nthe forthcoming political process; its role should not be\r\nrestricted to humanitarian issues only. Our\r\nOrganization must assume the leading role in\r\noverseeing the political process in the forthcoming\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nstage, including the finalization of the drafting of the\r\nconstitution and supervision of the elections to be held\r\nin order to form a sovereign Iraqi Government.\r\nJordan condemns in the strongest possible terms\r\nthe cowardly terrorist attack against the United Nations\r\nheadquarters in Baghdad. Despite the immense tragedy\r\nsuffered by the United Nations, we do have trust in the\r\nresolve and ability of the United Nations system to\r\nmaintain its operations and assistance to the Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nAs you are all aware, the Jordanian Embassy\r\ncomplex in Baghdad was also a target of a vicious\r\nterrorist attack that claimed many innocent lives.\r\nNonetheless, that appalling act reinforced our resolve\r\nto continue to reach out in every possible way to help\r\nour brothers in Iraq, in order to enable them to\r\novercome the overwhelming odds they have been\r\nenduring.\r\nTerrorism has proved to be a global phenomenon\r\nthat cuts across national boundaries and is not\r\nexclusive to a particular region, language, religion or\r\nrace. It is therefore imperative for all members and\r\ninstitutions of the world community to combat it and\r\neradicate it. Let me assure the Assembly that the\r\nGovernment and people of Jordan are determined to\r\nconfront this phenomenon which our citizens and\r\ninstitutions have suffered from for several decades.\r\nOnce again, let me reiterate our firm commitment to\r\ncooperate with all countries and international efforts in\r\nthe joint fight against terrorism.\r\nWe would like to express our full backing for the\r\nefforts aimed at achieving meaningful progress in the\r\ncurrent negotiations in the General Assembly to adopt\r\na comprehensive convention on combating terrorism\r\nand a convention on combating nuclear terrorism. We\r\nhope that these endeavors will prove successful in the\r\nformulation of a legal and specific definition of the\r\nconcept of terrorism which would set it apart from the\r\nrights protected under international law and\r\ninternational humanitarian law for States, peoples and\r\nindividuals.\r\nFor out part, Jordan repudiates all vicious\r\nfalsehoods and sinister campaigns to smear Arabs and\r\nMuslims with the label of terrorism. This phenomenon\r\nis in complete contradiction of the true nature and\r\nmeaning of the Islamic faith, which is anchored in the\r\nvalues of justice, tolerance, peaceful coexistence and\r\nreverence for humankind. Thus, we feel a pressing\r\nneed to pay due attention to the role that the dialogue\r\namong civilization plays in consolidating\r\nunderstanding and coexistence among peoples and\r\nnations. It also helps in eliminating the causes of\r\nextremism that emanate from a lack of genuine\r\nknowledge and comprehension of the essence of\r\nreligions and cultures that are based on disseminating a\r\nmessage of peace, understanding and acceptance of\r\nothers.\r\nThe political and economic developments\r\nunfolding in this era of globalization and information\r\ntechnology prompt us to accelerate the process of\r\npolitical and economic openness in the developing\r\ncountries. That will help in the evolution of stronger\r\nincentives for achieving further progress and stability.\r\nSuch an environment will be more amenable to\r\neconomic growth and will generate a stronger\r\nmomentum to eradicate poverty and human suffering as\r\nwe strive towards the fulfilment of the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIn that context, democracy assumes a special\r\nrelevance, especially since it is essentially an inherent\r\nprocess that evolves from the cultures and specific\r\ncharacteristics of societies. Therefore, it is virtually\r\nuntenable to impose this concept on others in\r\nprescribed forms that might not be in concert with the\r\ncultural structures of those communities.\r\nIn Jordan, however, we are committed to pursue\r\nthe path of democratic reforms and development of the\r\nnational political process in all its aspects. In fact, that\r\nissue is quite high on our national agenda, and our\r\nexpectation is that further progress will be made in the\r\nenhancement of our democratic institutions.\r\nBearing this in mind, Jordan will be guided by the\r\nconclusions outlined in the extremely valuable United\r\nNations Development Programme report on Arab\r\nHuman Development. We are grateful to the UNDP and\r\nits team of Arab experts for their analytical methods in\r\nidentifying and profiling some pressing challenges\r\ncurrently facing the Arab world. Jordan views this\r\npublication with great interest and perceives it from an\r\nextremely positive perspective, given its merits in\r\nterms of data, analytical approach and practical and\r\nspecific objectives as well as its valuable science-based\r\nconclusions and recommendations.\r\nOur primary purpose should be how to improve\r\nthe role and performance of the United Nations in all\r\nspheres of its operations. More specifically, that should\r\n29\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\ninclude strengthening its role in the areas of preventive\r\ndiplomacy, the management of humanitarian crises,\r\nconflicts and wars, human rights violations, and the\r\nchallenges associated with globalization and the\r\ndevelopment of humankind.\r\nIn that regard, Jordan welcomes the fact that the\r\nInternational Criminal Court is entering a new phase in\r\nterms of the election of its Judges and Prosecutor,\r\nwhich is a further step in the establishment of\r\ninternational justice and in how violations of\r\ninternational humanitarian law are treated. As the\r\nGeneral Assembly is well aware, Jordan had the\r\nprivilege of working hard to make significant\r\ncontributions in support of the Court’s creation and of\r\nthe entry into force of its Statute.\r\nIn the same vein, Jordan takes pride in the\r\nelection of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al-Abdullah to\r\nthe Board of Directors of the Victims’ Trust Fund\r\nestablished for the victims of crimes falling under the\r\njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. The\r\nFund is expected to have a tangible impact in\r\nalleviating the anguish of the victims of the most\r\nhorrifying crimes and of their families.\r\nWith regard to United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations, Jordan continues to attach great importance\r\nto this area of activity by the United Nations system.\r\nWe are proud and privileged to participate with other\r\nMember States in those global operations in areas that\r\nhave been afflicted by war, conflict and instability.\r\nHowever, to ensure the effective and complete\r\nfulfilment of the lofty objectives of the mandate of\r\neach peacekeeping operation, adequate budgetary funds\r\nmust be ensured for the operations’ smooth\r\nfunctioning, including on-time reimbursement of\r\npayments due to troop-contributing countries.\r\nIn closing, allow me once again to thank the\r\nPresident. I wish this session of the General Assembly\r\nevery success as I pray to Allah, our Lord, to enable us,\r\none and all, to live up to the responsibilities entrusted\r\nto us.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Professor S.\r\nJayakumar, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nRepublic of Singapore.\r\nMr. Jayakumar (Singapore): I would like to\r\ncongratulate Mr. Julian Hunte, the Foreign Minister of\r\nSaint Lucia, on his election as the new President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly. Singapore is delighted that a fellow\r\nsmall island State and member of the Forum of Small\r\nStates holds that office.\r\nI also join others in paying a tribute to United\r\nNations personnel who have fallen victim to violence\r\nor attacks, including a special tribute to the late\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello. The terrorist attack that caused\r\nhis death has outraged the entire civilized world.\r\nSergio dedicated his life, and ultimately gave his life,\r\nin the service of the United Nations. He is mourned and\r\nmissed by his many friends around the world. We can\r\nbest honour his memory by reaffirming our\r\ncommitment to the ideals that he served.\r\nThe run-up to the war in Iraq saw a heated debate\r\nabout the role of the United Nations. The United\r\nNations is, of course, no stranger to controversy, but\r\nthat debate was notable for being framed in particularly\r\nstark terms. The rhetoric was inflamed and inflated. It\r\nhas been variously asserted, with glee or gloom, that\r\nthe United Nations was irrelevant or irreplaceable, a\r\nthreat to national sovereignty, the sole source of\r\ninternational legitimacy, merely a tool of the remaining\r\nsuper-Power, or the only way to restrain that super-\r\nPower. There are indeed serious issues that require\r\ndebate, but the simplistic manner in which that debate\r\nwas framed — in particular the portrayal of a struggle\r\nbetween unilateralism and multilateralism — is, in my\r\nview, unhelpful. Unfortunately, that rhetoric has\r\nobscured, rather than clarified, the issue. It has\r\noversimplified the debate and glossed over the more\r\ncomplex reality. The danger is that we may believe in\r\nthe rhetoric and arrive at wrong conclusions about the\r\nrelevance, or irrelevance, of the United Nations. I am\r\ntherefore joining that debate with some trepidation, and\r\nI do so only to highlight some of the complexities, in\r\nthe hope that it will contribute to a more balanced\r\nappraisal of the United Nations. I shall start by\r\nrestating some basics.\r\nIn the 58 years since its formation, the influence\r\nand role of the United Nations in world affairs has\r\nalways flowed and ebbed in accordance with shifting\r\ngeopolitical tides. The role of the United Nations has\r\nbeen indispensable on some crucial international\r\nissues; on other occasions the United Nations has had\r\nno role, or only a marginal role. If that meant that the\r\nUnited Nations was irrelevant, then it was irrelevant\r\nlong before the recent war in Iraq. The ability of the\r\nUnited Nations to act and the kinds of actions it took\r\nhave always been contingent on how States, and in\r\n30\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nparticular the permanent members of the Security\r\nCouncil, perceived whether the United Nations served\r\ntheir interests. But the United Nations and the United\r\nNations system have always endured.\r\nNeither the variable fortunes nor the survival of\r\nthe United Nations should surprise anyone. The United\r\nNations functions in an international system consisting\r\nof sovereign States. Multilateralism and unilateralism\r\nwere never mutually exclusive alternatives; they are\r\ndifferent options in every State’s menu of policy\r\nchoices. Few States, large or small, would agree to\r\nentrust their security or other vital national interests\r\nentirely to a multilateral institution. On the other hand,\r\nno State, however powerful, can always succeed in\r\nachieving its objectives without the help of others.\r\nEvery State will choose the option that serves its\r\ninterest best.\r\nFurthermore, the United Nations as a total system\r\nis bigger than the General Assembly and the Security\r\nCouncil. As we debate the future of international\r\norganizations we should not forget that the world has\r\nnever been more interdependent, and therefore more in\r\nneed of global governance. The United Nations now\r\nhas more than 190 Members and has never been closer\r\nto the ideal of universal participation. There has never\r\nbeen a period in world history when there have been\r\nmore international legal regimes and norms regulating\r\nState behaviour. The Secretariat is the depository for\r\nover 500 international treaties covering the entire\r\nspectrum of global activities.\r\nInternational legal regimes and norms are\r\nimperfect in their efficiency and observance. Some\r\ninternational norms are hotly contested. Still, the\r\nconduct of international relations today does not take\r\nplace in a vacuum, but within that framework of laws,\r\nrules, standards and norms. Nevertheless, there is no\r\nescaping the fact that the maintenance of international\r\npeace and security is first among the purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations, and the most contested and\r\ncontroversial of its roles. It is also the focus of the\r\ncurrent debate over Iraq. It is here that the rhetorical\r\nexaggerations I mentioned earlier stand most in the\r\nway of clear and rational thinking about the strengths\r\nand limitations of the United Nations.\r\nTraditional international law recognizes only two\r\ngrounds for the use of force: self-defence under\r\nArticle 51 of the Charter and authorization by the\r\nSecurity Council. That seeming clarity is deceptive.\r\nEven before the latest Iraq war, traditional\r\ninterpretations of the Charter had been questioned. The\r\ndoctrine of self-defence has long been the subject of\r\nlearned debate. The current controversy over the right\r\nto pre-emption is only the latest manifestation. The\r\ndoctrine of humanitarian intervention — or\r\n“responsibility to protect” — so boldly brought to the\r\nfore by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, has for several\r\ndecades challenged the conventional concepts of non-\r\nintervention and the sovereign equality of States.\r\nAnother challenge to traditional approaches has\r\nbeen the threat posed by non-State actors, especially\r\nthe contemporary menace posed by perpetrators of\r\ninternational terrorism. The problem posed by rebel\r\ngroups in civil conflicts is another example.\r\nIn its efforts to respond to egregious violations of\r\nhuman rights, starvation, anarchy and chaos, the\r\nSecurity Council had already stretched both the\r\nauthority of the United Nations to intervene and the\r\ndefinition of “threats to the peace” and “aggression”.\r\nThe war in Iraq was not the first time, and will not be\r\nthe last time, that the Security Council was unable to\r\nact. The hope of the late 1980s and early 1990s that the\r\nend of the cold war would at last enable the Security\r\nCouncil to discharge its primary responsibility for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security has\r\nlong been shattered.\r\nIn retrospect, Iraq’s invasion and annexation of\r\nKuwait in 1990 represented an unusually clear-cut\r\nviolation of fundamental Charter principles. That\r\ngreatly eased the task of securing Security Council\r\nauthorization for military action.\r\nBut the consensus on Iraq was short-lived. By\r\n1994, France and Russia began to call for a road map\r\nfor the lifting of sanctions. By 1998, the withdrawal of\r\nthe United Nations Special Commission and Operation\r\nDesert Fox marked the end of the Security Council’s\r\nconsensus on Iraq. Thereafter the Security Council\r\nacted in accordance with a complex balance of\r\nprinciples and national interests, resulting in\r\ninconsistent and incoherent decisions. In the oil-for-\r\nfood debates humanitarian concerns about the\r\nconsequences of sanctions were mixed with the\r\ncommercial and business interests of some of the\r\npermanent members.\r\nThat did not, however, make the Security Council\r\nirrelevant. It merely meant that the Council served as a\r\nforum for managing competing interests, an important\r\n31\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nrole that it has played for all its history. After all, while\r\nSecurity Council resolutions have the force of law, they\r\nare, at the end of the day, first and foremost political\r\ndocuments indicating the degree of consensus that can\r\nbe achieved among its most powerful members at any\r\none time.\r\nI do not think that it is self-evident that the 2002-\r\n2003 clash of interests over Iraq was qualitatively\r\ndifferent from the differences between the permanent\r\nmembers during the previous decade. I do not think\r\nthat the disagreement over Iraq has permanently\r\ndamaged the United Nations.\r\nThe 2002-2003 crisis over Iraq in the Security\r\nCouncil only underscored what we have known all\r\nalong, namely, that the Security Council can authorize\r\nintervention only when the permanent members are in\r\nagreement, and that all States, big and small, will do\r\nwhat they must to protect their vital national interests.\r\nThis is not the occasion to revisit old debates over\r\nwhether the war in Iraq was authorized on the basis of\r\na continuity of authority from 1990 to 2003. Certainly,\r\nas resolution 1441 (2002) recognized, Iraq had been in\r\nmaterial breach of several resolutions. My point is that,\r\nwhatever its eventual outcome, the intense diplomatic\r\neffort to secure another explicit resolution for the use\r\nof force was itself testimony to the importance attached\r\nby all to the Security Council’s legitimizing role. In\r\nMay, only weeks after a formal end to major combat\r\noperations was declared, resolution 1483 (2003) was\r\nadopted without any dissenting vote, recognizing that\r\nthe United Nations had a significant role in post-war\r\nIraq.\r\nMore balanced views are now beginning to\r\nemerge, albeit still tainted by the bitterness of the\r\ndebates in the run-up to the war. It will be some time\r\nbefore consensus can be reached on the role of the\r\nUnited Nations in post-war Iraq. Some are loath to\r\ngrant ex post facto legitimization of military action. At\r\nthe same time, there is reluctance to cede power won\r\nwith blood. But the legitimacy that the United Nations\r\nbrings is unique.\r\nThe debate on the role of the United Nations will\r\ncontinue. It can, and should, go on. But that does not\r\nmean that the United Nations should be in paralysis.\r\nWe must at the same time press on with our\r\ncommitment to fulfil the fundamental purposes of the\r\nUnited Nations, which, as stated in the Charter, are “To\r\nmaintain international peace and security”, “To develop\r\nfriendly relations among nations” and “To achieve\r\ninternational cooperation”.\r\nThe starting point for that effort must be\r\nacceptance of the fact that, while the United Nations\r\nstands for ideals that we must never relinquish, the\r\nreality is that the United Nations both reflects and\r\nshapes geopolitics. Underlying the debates in the run-\r\nup to the war, and still infusing the controversies, is\r\nacute uneasiness over the distribution of power in the\r\npost-cold war international system. But can the United\r\nNations escape that reality? The fact is that the United\r\nNations can operate only on the basis of a hard-headed\r\nappreciation of the realities of power. If we allow\r\nexaggerated rhetoric about the role of the United\r\nNations to obscure that fact, then we do the United\r\nNations a disservice.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations has remained\r\nessentially unchanged since 1945. But it has been\r\ncontinuously interpreted and re-interpreted to meet\r\nchanging geopolitical circumstances and new\r\nchallenges, many of which were unforeseen by the\r\nfounders of the United Nations.\r\nToday we are again faced with radically new\r\nthreats, not least of which are the global terrorist\r\nnetworks that respect neither national boundaries nor\r\ntraditional international law. Clearly, the United\r\nNations needs to fashion new and more flexible rules to\r\ndeal with these new threats. Yet, at the same time, we\r\nmust continue to ensure that there are adequate\r\nsafeguards to prevent abuse or a return to the law of the\r\njungle.\r\nFinding the right balance between those equally\r\nurgent imperatives will not be easy. But it is not\r\nimpossible, if we can find the discipline to debate the\r\nissues openly and realistically, with a clear\r\nappreciation of both the limitations and potential of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nRecent events in Iraq have shown that the United\r\nStates needs the United Nations. It is also a fact that\r\nthe United Nations needs the United States. Since there\r\nis a convergence of interests for the two to cooperate in\r\norder to achieve our shared interests and objectives, it\r\nis surely not impossible for us to negotiate and agree\r\nupon a new paradigm of cooperation between the\r\nworld’s sole super-Power and the world’s only, and\r\nindispensable, United Nations.\r\n32\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nThe United Nations is not a panacea for all the\r\nworld’s ills. Neither is the United Nations a global\r\nvillain. The United Nations is a political institution.\r\nPolitics, as is often said, is the art of the possible.\r\nThere is no need, therefore, to succumb to despair or\r\ncynicism. We should turn the page and move on.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish):\r\nI now give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Baboucarr-Blaise Ismaila Jagne, Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Gambia.\r\nMr. Jagne (Gambia): Please allow me to convey\r\nmy delegation’s warmest congratulations to\r\nMr. Julian Hunte on his election to the high office of\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession. I am sure that his vast experience on the\r\ninternational scene will be brought to bear on the work\r\nof this session, and help direct it with ease to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. The fifty-eighth session\r\npromises to be rich in substance, and may also prove to\r\nbe a watershed in our bid to make the United Nations\r\nresponsive to the needs of the peoples of the world in\r\nthe new millennium. I wish to assure the President of\r\nmy delegation’s fullest cooperation in the discharge of\r\nhis onerous responsibilities.\r\nIn the same vein, let me also congratulate the out-\r\ngoing President, Mr. Jan Kavan, for his laudable efforts\r\nduring the fifty-seventh session. The dynamic\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, also deserves\r\ncommendation for another productive year of service to\r\nthe Organization, a year that was fraught with\r\ndifficulties and incredible challenges. Thanks to his\r\nleadership, we have, by and large, been able to weather\r\nthe storm.\r\nWe were all devastated, however, by the bombing\r\nof the offices of the United Nations in Baghdad, which\r\nclaimed the lives of so many people. May it never\r\nrecur — please God — but it shows that we must\r\nremain united in our resolve to fight terrorism. Let me\r\nseize this opportunity to express once again to\r\nMr. Kofi Annan and his staff, as well as to the relatives\r\nof the victims, the heartfelt condolences of the\r\npeople of The Gambia. We pay homage to\r\nMr. Sergio Vieira de Mello and his colleagues, who lost\r\ntheir lives, and we mourn the tragic loss of a highly-\r\nacclaimed international civil servant at the hands of\r\nterrorists. In wishing the injured a speedy recovery, we\r\npray that the souls of all those who died rest in perfect\r\npeace. My delegation strongly urges that that cowardly\r\nact should in no way weaken the resolve of the United\r\nNations in fulfilling its obligations to the people of\r\nIraq.\r\nResolution 1373 (2001) was adopted unanimously\r\nby the Security Council following the attacks of\r\n11 September, and the majority of Member States,\r\nincluding my own, have embarked on implementing its\r\nsalient provisions. We have ratified the major\r\ninternational instruments on terrorism and,\r\nfurthermore, have enacted domestic legislation to\r\nimplement them. Let me state that, in spite of our\r\nmodest achievements in that regard, international\r\ncooperation and technical assistance remain critical to\r\nthe success of our future implementation efforts.\r\nThe Counter-Terrorism Committee’s assistance\r\nunit must strengthen the coordination of its technical\r\nassistance portfolio in order to have greater impact. In\r\nthat regard, we welcome the commitment of the G-8 to\r\nprovide capacity-building and technical assistance to\r\npriority countries. The translation of declarations of\r\ncommitment into concrete action is the only guarantee\r\nof making meaningful headway to counter terrorism.\r\nApart from the recent terrorist attacks against the\r\nUnited Nations in Baghdad, other such incidents in\r\nIndonesia, Kenya, the Russian Federation, Morocco\r\nand Saudi Arabia, coming in the wake of the attacks of\r\n11 September, are reminders of the enormity of the\r\ntasks ahead.\r\nThe fifty-eighth session of the General Assembly\r\nhas been convened at a time when our approaches to\r\nthe management of global issues have come under\r\nsharp scrutiny. Those issues are the unfinished business\r\nof the preceding millennium. The United Nations —\r\nthe premier, overarching venue for multilateralism —\r\ncannot but be the only vehicle through which the\r\nworld’s peace and security problems can be solved.\r\nThe recent events in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere\r\nonly serve to underscore the need for the nations of the\r\nworld to strengthen, not weaken, multilateralism. We\r\nshall never achieve global peace, security and\r\nprosperity without working together in a forum such as\r\nthe one provided by the United Nations, a forum that is\r\nall-inclusive and which permits each and every\r\nnation — big or small, rich or poor — to expound on\r\nmatters of concern to them. The ideals and principles\r\nthat were the basis of the founding of the Organization\r\nare as relevant today as they were 58 years ago. Let us\r\ntherefore demonstrate our commitment to\r\nmultilateralism by always turning to the United\r\n33\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nNations. My delegation therefore urges all Member\r\nStates to maintain confidence in the United Nations\r\nand to have recourse to the Organization for the\r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts and the settlement of\r\ndisputes.\r\nWhile terrorism poses a real threat to\r\ninternational peace and security, other violent conflicts\r\ncontinue to rage around the world, leaving death,\r\ndestruction and desolation in their wake. The situation\r\nin the Mano River Union region remains volatile as I\r\nspeak. Even though former President Charles Taylor of\r\nLiberia has left the scene, as was required of him, and\r\nthere appears to be some laudable progress towards\r\nreinvigorating the democratic process in that country,\r\nwe should be under no illusion as to the extreme\r\nfragility of the situation in Liberia, and indeed within\r\nthe West African subregion. We commend all the\r\nparties that recently signed the Peace Agreement in\r\nAccra, Ghana, for their determination and patience, and\r\nurge them to do all in their power to stay the course.\r\nThat would also have a salutary effect on the situation\r\nin neighbouring Sierra Leone, where we note with\r\nsatisfaction the consolidation of the peace process.\r\nHowever, the problem of conflicts in West Africa\r\ncontinues to be compounded by the illicit flow of small\r\narms and light weapons, as well as by roving bands of\r\nmercenaries. International efforts could serve the\r\nregion best by developing comprehensive disarmament,\r\ndemobilization and rehabilitation programmes that\r\ntarget militias and that are region-specific rather than\r\ncountry-specific. We must endeavour to address the\r\nissue of the illicit trade in small arms and light\r\nweapons with greater determination. An arrangement\r\nsimilar to the Kimberley Process in blood diamonds is\r\nwhat is urgently required to effectively stem the illicit\r\nflow of small arms and light weapons. My Government\r\nstrongly supports any measure that would treat as\r\naccomplices to war crimes and crimes against\r\nhumanity illegal brokers who knowingly supply arms\r\nand weapons to militias and other insurgents in West\r\nAfrica. Conflict zones elsewhere in Africa that tell a\r\nsimilar story should also be assisted in that manner.\r\nWe warmly congratulate our brothers in Sudan on\r\nthe recent signing of the Naivasha peace accord, which\r\npromises to bring the long-drawn fratricidal conflict in\r\nthat country to an end.\r\nMeanwhile, my Government continues to play its\r\npart in the search for solutions to the problems of peace\r\nand security in Africa. We participate actively within\r\nthe context of the initiatives of the Economic\r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) to\r\ncontribute to the subregion’s collective efforts in that\r\narea. My Government, under the wise leadership of\r\nPresident Jammeh, has in the past contributed, and will\r\ncontribute in the future, to subregional efforts to keep\r\nthe peace in West Africa. We have continuously\r\nparticipated in the United Nations Mission in Sierra\r\nLeone (UNAMSIL) since its inception. We stand ready\r\nto contribute our own modest share to any other United\r\nNations peacekeeping operations designed for the\r\nWest Africa subregion, as we are doing now under the\r\nECOWAS Military Mission in Liberia (ECOMIL). In\r\nthat regard, we welcome the adoption of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1509 (2003), establishing the United\r\nNations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).\r\nI just made mention of the unfinished business of\r\nthe preceding millennium. Those are thematic issues of\r\npolitical exclusion, disenfranchisement, economic\r\nexclusion and abject poverty. All affect the greater\r\nmajority of humankind. They also give rise to all the\r\nurgent situations that the world is faced with today —\r\nsituations of conflict and civil strife; in short, of the\r\nabsence of peace.\r\nA peculiar situation of exclusion was created by\r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) on\r\n25 October 1971, which relates, through its direct\r\neffects, to Taiwan. From 1949 to 1971, the Republic of\r\nChina (Taiwan) was a bona fide member of the United\r\nNations, recognized by the comity of nations. If the\r\nRepublic of China (Taiwan) could be a member of the\r\nUnited Nations then, why could it not be a member\r\nnow? The General Assembly adopted resolution 2758\r\n(XXVI), which addressed only the question of the\r\nrepresentation of the People’s Republic of China at the\r\nUnited Nations and related organizations. It did not\r\ndecide that Taiwan was, or should be, a part of the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China. Nor did it confer on the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China the right to represent the\r\nRepublic of China (Taiwan) or the 23 million\r\nTaiwanese people in the United Nations and related\r\norganizations. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) has since been\r\nmisused to justify the exclusion of Taiwan from the\r\nUnited Nations. That runs counter to the claim by the\r\nGovernment of the People’s Republic of China that it\r\nrepresents the interests of all Chinese, not to mention\r\nthose Taiwanese who are in the Republic of China\r\n(Taiwan). If we are to comprehensively deal with the\r\n34\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nproblems engendered by exclusion in whatever form it\r\ntakes, I call on the international community to revisit\r\nthat issue urgently.\r\nMy Government appreciates the special attention\r\nthat Guinea-Bissau has received from the Security\r\nCouncil, especially through the Council’s Ad Hoc\r\nWorking Group on Conflict Prevention and Resolution\r\nin Africa. We also commend the remarkable efforts of\r\nthe Economic and Social Council’s Ad Hoc Advisory\r\nGroup on Guinea-Bissau. As Chairperson of the Group\r\nof Friends of Guinea-Bissau, my Government\r\nacknowledges the groundswell of support and good\r\nwill that Guinea-Bissau enjoys from the Organization.\r\nUnfortunately, that has not yet been adequately\r\ntranslated into material and financial forms of\r\nassistance, which the people of that country so\r\ndesperately need. The recent developments in Guinea-\r\nBissau should be seen not so much as a constraint, but\r\nrather as an opportunity to re-engage the international\r\ncommunity, in partnership with the people of Guinea-\r\nBissau, in the resolution of their problems of\r\ngovernance and development. Now that concerted\r\nefforts are being made by all the major actors to agree\r\non transitional arrangements for the preparation of\r\nparliamentary and presidential elections in the not-too-\r\ndistant future, we call on the rest of the international\r\ncommunity to provide the support necessary to\r\nstabilize the situation and keep the process on course to\r\na successful outcome.\r\nProblems of security and peace in my part of the\r\nworld have not in any way diminished our concerns\r\nover similar problems elsewhere. The people of Iraq\r\nand Afghanistan need urgent international assistance to\r\nshore up security, re-establish the rule of law and\r\nembark on an effective programme of reconstruction.\r\nMy Government welcomes the adoption of resolution\r\n1500 (2003), in the hope that the establishment of the\r\nGoverning Council of Iraq will lead towards a real\r\npolitical transition for the Iraqi people. While a speedy\r\nend to the occupation of Iraq is both desirable and\r\nurgent, as clearly underscored in resolution 1472\r\n(2003), outstanding issues emanating from Iraq’s\r\noccupation of Kuwait should be comprehensively dealt\r\nwith once and for all.\r\nWe continue to follow closely the situation in the\r\nMiddle East, and we deplore yet again the recent spate\r\nof vicious attacks and counter-attacks between Israelis\r\nand Palestinians, thus negating hope for an early\r\nsettlement within the framework of the road map. Trust\r\nand confidence-building measures must be reinforced\r\nand made to attend to every stage of the\r\nimplementation of the road map, if the peace process is\r\nto endure. Suicide bombings that target innocent\r\ncivilians must be stopped. The occupation of Arab\r\nlands must come to an end. In reiterating our position\r\non the Arab-Israeli conflict, we call for the creation of\r\nan independent Palestinian State living in peace\r\nalongside the State of Israel.\r\nMy Government firmly supports the initiatives\r\nbeing taken to reduce tensions between India and\r\nPakistan, two great friends of The Gambia. We urge\r\nthem both to reduce the arms build-up on their\r\nrespective sides of the border and to strive harder to\r\nreach a mutually acceptable solution to their\r\ndifferences, in particular with regard to the issue of\r\nKashmir. Similarly, we reiterate our support for a\r\npeaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula.\r\nHuman security is not threatened by conflicts\r\nalone. The scourge of HIV/AIDS continues to be\r\nelusive, and now poses a serious threat to the viability\r\nof some societies in Africa. The HIV/AIDS pandemic\r\nhas slowly evolved from a health and humanitarian\r\nissue to a development and security problem. The\r\npandemic has compounded the problems African\r\ncountries face in the fight against other scourges, such\r\nas malaria and tuberculosis. It is gratifying to note\r\nhowever, that the international community is sensitized\r\nto that fact and that initiatives such as the Global Fund\r\nto Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria have been put\r\nin place. Consequently, more money, resources and\r\nattention must be given to research and development.\r\nContributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria have slackened, and\r\ndeveloping countries are paying a colossal price in\r\nhuman and material terms. The initiative of the Global\r\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization equally\r\nrequires adequate funding.\r\nThe pursuit of justice and the international rule of\r\nlaw have never been as pressing as it is today. My\r\nGovernment strongly supports the International\r\nCriminal Court as it embarks on its crucial mandate of\r\ndelivering justice. We hail its progress so far, and I\r\nwould like to seize this opportunity to call on all to\r\ncooperate with the Court in order that, together all\r\naround the world, we can say no to the culture of\r\nimpunity.\r\n35\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nWhile still on the subject of justice, let me\r\nreiterate my Government’s view that the sanctions\r\nbeing imposed on Cuba should now be lifted. They are\r\ncounter-productive anyway. Cuba is a peace-loving\r\nmember of the international community whose people\r\ndo not deserve the punishment that has been meted out\r\nto them for almost four decades now.\r\nLet me now turn to development issues. In\r\nAfrica, our efforts to achieve sustainable development\r\ncontinue to be seriously undermined by a variety of\r\nfactors, prominent among which are conflicts,\r\nstructural weaknesses, natural disasters and disease.\r\nFor the international system to successfully address\r\nthose factors of underdevelopment, more serious\r\nattention must be paid to the implementation of the\r\nBrussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed\r\nCountries for the Decade 2001-2010, and more\r\nattention must be focused on the attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. We must also give\r\neffect to the commitments made at Doha, Monterrey\r\nand Johannesburg.\r\nThere is no shortage of blueprints for\r\ndevelopment. What is in short supply, and what needs\r\nto be urgently mobilized, are resources. So far, there is\r\nstill a big gap between commitment and action.\r\nAfrica’s development partners must make good on their\r\npledges to support Africa’s development. My\r\ndelegation welcomes the Africa Action Plan of the G-8,\r\nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act of the United\r\nStates of America and the “Everything But Arms”\r\ninitiative of the European Union, all of which commit\r\ntheir sponsors to well-defined forms of support for\r\nAfrica’s development.\r\nThere are, however, many barriers to the\r\nimplementation of those initiatives, which are caused\r\nby certain protectionist policies pursued by our\r\npartners, as well as other policy and structural\r\nconstraints. The problem of farm subsidies just will not\r\ngo away. Agricultural economies in our part of the\r\nworld must be allowed to compete if the global trading\r\nsystem is to function in favour of the eradication of\r\npoverty. The debt issue is far from being resolved and\r\nthe procedures for accessing the benefits of the Highly\r\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) are too\r\ncumbersome for many poor countries to follow. The\r\nonly realistic approach to the debt problem as a major\r\nimpediment to development is to cancel it\r\nunconditionally for HIPC countries and for low-income\r\ncountries under stress.\r\nWe have just ended at Cancún another attempt at\r\nnegotiations on world trade. My delegation deeply\r\nregrets the failure of the talks, as well as the fact that\r\nthe developed world could not see eye to eye with the\r\nGroup of 21 on the issue of subsidies. It is in our\r\ncollective interest to dismantle global trade barriers and\r\nallow markets to expand, for incomes to rise in the\r\ndeveloping world and poverty to be reduced. Stronger\r\nearning power in the developing world would stimulate\r\nworld trade in ways that would be most beneficial to\r\nrich countries. My delegation calls on all concerned to\r\nensure that we return to the negotiating table as soon as\r\npossible, and with greater determination on both sides,\r\nto reach a just and fair agreement on all the issues\r\ninvolved.\r\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) still falls\r\nshort of the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent\r\nof gross domestic product. We commend the countries\r\nwhose ODA has risen to that level, in particular\r\nDenmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden.\r\nMy delegation urges all of Africa’s development\r\npartners to address those issues with sincerity and\r\ncommitment, with a view to meaningfully assisting in\r\nkick-starting the sustainable human development\r\nprocess in African countries.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the Human\r\nDevelopment Report 2003 is devoted to the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. In that way, the fight against\r\npoverty is kept high on the international community’s\r\nagenda, because we still have a very long way to go.\r\nFor instance, as stated in the report,\r\n“Regionally, at the current pace Sub-Saharan\r\nAfrica would not reach the Goals for poverty\r\nuntil 2147 and for child mortality until 2165. And\r\nfor HIV/AIDS and hunger, trends in the region\r\nare heading up — not down.” (Human\r\nDevelopment Report 2003, p. 2)\r\nIt is indeed true that sub-Saharan Africa is being\r\nleft behind. That state of affairs is alarming and, as the\r\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has\r\nrightly stated, the Millennium Development Goals will\r\nnot be realized with a business-as-usual approach. The\r\nparadox, in our view, is the fact that, while the means\r\nto attain the Goals are available, it would appear that\r\nthe political will to do so is lacking. Let me again\r\nquote from the Human Development Report 2003.\r\n36\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\n“Today’s world has greater resources and\r\nknow-how than ever before to tackle the\r\nchallenges of infectious disease, low productivity,\r\nlack of clean energy and transport and lack of\r\nbasic services such as clean water, sanitation,\r\nschools and health care. The issue is how best to\r\napply these resources and know-how to benefit\r\nthe poorest people.” (ibid, p. 3)\r\nIn The Gambia, my Government’s focus is on the\r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals. The\r\nstrategy we have designed to that end is detailed in our\r\npoverty reduction strategy paper. In a resource-\r\nstrapped economy such as The Gambia’s, getting all\r\nthe relevant indicators to perform well towards poverty\r\nreduction is a daunting challenge. It is, however, a\r\nchallenge my Government is prepared to take up. Our\r\nspecial focus is on the empowerment of our people, and\r\nwe seek to do so by giving priority to our education,\r\nhealth and agricultural sectors, as well as by building\r\ncapacity among our women, who are the architects of\r\nstable and strong nations. That strategy has so far\r\nyielded dividends, as evidenced by my country’s\r\nshowing on UNDP’s Human Development Report\r\n2003.\r\nIn the education sector our goal is to achieve full\r\nenrolment well before the Millennium Declaration’s\r\ntarget year of 2015. As of now, we have taken the gross\r\nenrolment rate from 44 per cent, eight years ago, to\r\nover 90 per cent today. We have, at the same time,\r\nincreased non-formal, adult and distance education\r\nprogrammes throughout the country. The net result has\r\nbeen a dramatic drop in illiteracy nationwide.\r\nTransition rates from primary to secondary levels have\r\nbeen significantly improved, from 12 per cent, 15 years\r\nago, to over 77 per cent today. Six years ago there were\r\nhardly any tertiary level institutions to speak of. Today\r\nthey abound, and include the new University of The\r\nGambia. That has been made possible by the visionary\r\nleadership provided by Al Hadji Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Gambia.\r\nRecognizing the important role women play in\r\nthe family, in the community and in the nation, my\r\nGovernment has sought to pay special attention to the\r\nempowerment of our women through education,\r\ntraining and special income-generating projects. In\r\norder to increase opportunities for the girl child in the\r\neducational system, we have created a trust fund,\r\nentitled “The President’s Empowerment of Girls\r\nEducation Project”, to provide full scholarships to girls\r\nwho would otherwise not be able to go to school for\r\nlack of resources. That and other measures geared\r\ntowards assisting women have helped to close the\r\ngender gap in education in Gambia.\r\nEmpowering the rural dweller is another priority\r\nof my Government. We seek to do so through measures\r\nthat lead to an increase in access to resources,\r\ninfrastructure and services, as well as to knowledge\r\nand skills. Most villages now have a primary school,\r\nand clusters of villages share secondary education\r\nfacilities.\r\nOur efforts have also been geared towards the\r\nimprovement of the health of our people. Significantly\r\nimproved child health care, especially through an\r\nextensive and comprehensive immunization\r\nprogramme, has contributed immensely towards a\r\nconsiderable reduction in infant mortality in the last\r\nfew years. Infant mortality rates have been reduced by\r\none third. Primary health care programmes have been\r\nstrengthened across the board. Overall, access to health\r\nfacilities and services have equally been greatly\r\nimproved, with the construction of hospitals, health\r\ncentres, clinics and dispensaries throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\nFor all these achievements, however, we are\r\nhumbled by the challenges that still remain. The\r\nprevalence of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria\r\nand a host of respiratory illnesses, is part of an\r\nunfinished agenda. Malaria, in particular, remains a\r\nmajor problem. It is the leading cause of mortality and\r\na major cause of morbidity among pregnant women,\r\ncontributing to anaemia and low birth weight. Today,\r\nwith the cooperation of a Cuban medical and health\r\nteam, The Gambia is number one in Africa as far as its\r\nmalaria control programme is concerned, according to\r\nthe World Health Organization.\r\nIn the area of agriculture, our objective is to\r\nachieve a total transformation of the sector. Our\r\npriority is to reduce the drudgery of production and\r\nincrease productivity through a systematic programme\r\nof mechanization. Added to this is our bid to reduce\r\nour dependence on rain-fed methods of production, in\r\nfavour of greater irrigation, using the abundant water\r\nresources that the Gambia River and its tributaries\r\nprovide. A third plank of our programme of\r\nempowerment in the agriculture sector is to diversify\r\nactivities away from the traditional crops by placing\r\ngreater emphasis on food production as well as on\r\n37\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nother non-traditional crops for export. Finally, with all\r\nof these objectives already well on the road to success,\r\nwe are beginning to increase market access, both\r\nlocally and abroad, for our producers.\r\nAttaining the Millennium Development Goals\r\nwill depend to a large extent on how well poor\r\ncountries perform in the areas I have just referred to. It\r\nwould also depend on how far they themselves are\r\nempowered, and made capable of performing, through\r\nthe requisite support measures from the international\r\ncommunity. The United Nations system as a whole can\r\nbe mobilized further to broker such support for poor\r\ncountries, and especially for those among them that\r\nshow promise and positive signs of progress.\r\nMy Government has been increasing its efforts to\r\ndeepen democracy and strengthening good governance\r\nin The Gambia. To that end, our intent is to\r\ncontinuously bring improvements to the performance\r\nof all arms of government. Our multiparty democratic\r\nsystem forms the backbone of our political\r\ndispensation. We continue to conduct free and fair\r\nelections at all levels of popular representation. Our\r\ncourts operate independently. We have encouraged the\r\nmass media to grow and expand, with increasingly\r\nhigher levels of private participation. The international\r\ncommunity must have been satisfied with our efforts\r\nand achievements in this domain, since the World\r\nEconomic Forum, meeting in South Africa, decided to\r\nclassify The Gambia third in Africa, for its\r\nperformance on good governance. We are indeed\r\nhonoured by this recognition, and feel encouraged in\r\nour resolve to do even better.\r\nAdvances in information and communication\r\ntechnology have come to make our world a truly global\r\nvillage. This is indeed remarkable. However, we must\r\nnot lose sight of the fact that even in this area there is a\r\ngreat deal of catching up to be done by the developing\r\nworld. Global initiatives geared towards bridging the\r\ndigital divide between the developed and developing\r\nworlds should be pursued with unrelenting vigour.\r\nScientific and technological research must be\r\nconducted in support of the essence of life. In the\r\ncourse of this year, we have heard several claims as to\r\nthe successful cloning of human embryos. These\r\nclaims, whether genuine or not, are indeed a wake-up\r\ncall for all of humanity. The international community\r\nmust close ranks to address them in a manner that\r\nensures that no one is allowed, for whatever reason, to\r\ntinker with science and technology in ways that may\r\nupset or threaten nature’s fragile balance.\r\nThe phenomenon of illegal, unregulated and\r\nunreported fishing remains a challenge to coastal\r\nAfrican States such as The Gambia. It has generated\r\nenormous concern at the international level, as is\r\nevident from the adoption of various international\r\ninstruments to combat it. My delegation would like to\r\nexpress its gratitude to the Governments of Japan and\r\nLuxembourg and the Food and Agriculture\r\nOrganization for the assistance that they provide to our\r\nfisheries sector, and to fully endorse the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendation that technical and financial\r\nassistance to developing countries for the conservation\r\nand management of fisheries resources should be\r\nprovided in a comprehensive manner. We call for\r\ngreater assistance and cooperation in our efforts to\r\npromote sustainable practices in the fisheries sector of\r\nour economies.\r\nOn the crucial topic of United Nations reform, my\r\ndelegation welcomes the efforts aimed at the\r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the reform\r\nof the Security Council. After more than a decade, little\r\nprogress has been made in our attempts to reform the\r\nSecurity Council so that it is truly reflective of the\r\nrealities of the international system in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. My Government reiterates its stance — indeed\r\nthe stance of the entire African region — that the\r\ncomposition of the Security Council has to be\r\nrevamped and democratized. Membership of the\r\nCouncil must be expanded, with Africa occupying at\r\nleast two permanent seats and five non-permanent\r\nseats. We therefore wholeheartedly support the timely\r\nproposal of the Secretary-General to establish a high-\r\nlevel panel of eminent personalities to make concrete\r\nrecommendations, inter alia, on the reforms of the\r\nOrganization.\r\nAs we move into the business of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly, my delegation prays\r\nthat the Almighty Allah crowns our endeavours with\r\nsuccess. We pray that this session proves to be the\r\nturning point in our efforts to render the United\r\nNations more relevant, more effective and truly all-\r\ninclusive. We pray that at this session, any doubts as to\r\nthe utility of the United Nations to each and every one\r\nof us be put to rest once and for all. We pray that by the\r\nclose of this session, we shall all have emerged secure\r\nin our conviction that only through fuller recourse to\r\nthe United Nations can we expect to have our global\r\n38\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nproblems of conflict, peace and security and, indeed,\r\ndevelopment, frontally addressed, fully contained and\r\ncompletely resolved.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Bhekh Bahadur\r\nThapa, chairman of the delegation of the Kingdom of\r\nNepal.\r\nMr. Thapa (Nepal): I greet Julian Hunte warmly\r\nas President at this session and assure him of Nepal’s\r\nfull cooperation in his work. His Excellency Jan\r\nKavan, the outgoing President, deserves our\r\nappreciation for the job well done. I also pay tribute to\r\nthe distinguished Secretary-General for providing\r\ndynamic leadership to the United Nations.\r\nThe last 12 months have been a momentous\r\nperiod of convulsive events. It has been a mixed bag.\r\nWe have made a dent in combating terrorism, but it\r\nremains a serious threat to peace. Some countries have\r\nlimped back to normality, while others have descended\r\ninto chaos. All sides have accepted the Middle East\r\nroad map, but a new cycle of violence is undermining\r\nit. Iraq continues to be a source of concern to all. The\r\nglobal economic slump has turned the corner, but\r\ngrowth remains anaemic, and the Cancun trade talks\r\nhave foundered.\r\nIn these developments, the United Nations has\r\ncome into a sharp focus that is not always flattering.\r\nHowever, Nepal has an abiding faith in the United\r\nNations and believes in its centrality for all humanity’s\r\nquest for shared peace, progress and justice. To small\r\nnations like ours, the United Nations is and should be\r\nthe bulwark of sovereignty and defender of freedom. It\r\nhas stood up to such challenges in the past, and it must\r\nprepare itself to face the future just as boldly through a\r\nprocess of strengthened multilateralism.\r\nToday, the world faces a number of threats to its\r\npeace, progress and harmony. Terrorism is now by far\r\nthe most immediate threat that afflicts countries, rich\r\nand poor, large and small. After 11 September 2001,\r\nthe concerted battle we have launched has pushed\r\nterror into retreat, but the decisive war against it that\r\nwe must win has yet to be won.\r\nThis scourge has not left the United Nations\r\nuntouched either. For instance, two bombs exploded\r\nwithin the first two months of the United Nations\r\npresence in Baghdad at its offices there, killing Mr.\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello and others, and serving as a\r\ngrim reminder of the indiscriminate dark threat of\r\nterrorism. We condemn the assault on the United\r\nNations and our profound condolences go to the\r\ncountries that lost their citizens and families who lost\r\ntheir dear ones in those tragic attacks.\r\nMy own nation is in the throes of terrorism,\r\nperpetrated by the self-proclaimed Maoists for the last\r\nseven years. Opposed to constitutional monarchy and\r\ndemocratic order, the Maoists have broken the\r\nseven-month ceasefire, withdrawn from the talks and\r\nunleashed unspeakable violence on the people. They\r\ndid so even as the Government showed flexibility in\r\naccommodating several of their demands and put a\r\ncomprehensive package of reforms on the table.\r\nHis Majesty’s Government has the duty to protect\r\nthe life and liberty of the people and to defend freedom\r\nand democracy in the country. We will do so resolutely\r\nbut also responsibly. While doing so, we have kept the\r\ndoor of dialogue open. On behalf of the Government, I\r\nthank our friends for their understanding and assistance\r\nin our war against terror and the Secretary-General for\r\nhis interest and concern.\r\nClearly, Iraq continues to be a serious issue. Now\r\nthat the war is over, the global community must agree\r\nto return sovereignty to the Iraqi people as quickly as\r\npossible, to let them govern themselves and to help\r\nthem rebuild their country. The United Nations should\r\nbe given an enhanced role in this process.\r\nRenewed violence in the Middle East has\r\nimperilled the Quartet-endorsed road map, which\r\npromises a viable State to the Palestinians and security\r\nto the Israelis. Nepal appeals to both sides to exercise\r\nmaximum restraint and engage in constructive dialogue\r\nto attain a comprehensive settlement of the long-\r\nfestering crisis. It also appeals to Israel to reconsider\r\nits decision to remove Palestinian President Arafat.\r\nThe Security Council must take an early decision\r\nto extend security throughout Afghanistan so that\r\nrebuilding can go forward in the country. It should also\r\naugment efforts to resolve conflicts and bring stability\r\nto volatile countries in Africa and elsewhere.\r\nNepal has a deep interest in, and unwavering\r\ncommitment to, United Nations peacekeeping.\r\nNepalese Blue Helmets have served in various\r\nmissions in an outstanding manner, and many of them\r\nhave made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of peace\r\nand humanity. The United Nations should continue to\r\n39\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nhelp poor troop-contributing countries to bridge their\r\nresources gaps, and give them more say in mission\r\nplanning and deployment of forces.\r\nWhile firefighting in crisis situations is urgent,\r\nthe international community must look beyond the\r\nimmediacy of conflicts and attempt to build an edifice\r\nof durable peace in the world. Disarmament,\r\ndevelopment and the rule of law are the pillars of such\r\narchitecture. There is a moral case for all of us to work\r\ntogether towards such peace and it is also a matter of\r\nenlightened self-interest.\r\nDisarmament and confidence-building measures\r\nare critical to building a culture of peace. Nuclear\r\nweapons are the greatest threat to humanity and must\r\nbe eliminated, with their delivery vehicles, in a time-\r\nbound manner. Nuclear-weapon States should steadily\r\nreduce their nuclear arsenals; the Conference on\r\nDisarmament must draw up a strategy to eradicate\r\nthese arms.\r\nAs a nation committed to peace, Nepal welcomes\r\nthe proposals to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones\r\nand to keep outer space free of weapons. We also stress\r\nthe necessity to reinforce the regimes banning chemical\r\nand biological weapons and to strengthen measures to\r\nprevent the access of non-State actors to small arms\r\nand light weapons.\r\nNepal supports the regional centres for peace and\r\ndisarmament as significant tools for building\r\nconfidence among nations. We eagerly look forward to\r\nhosting in Kathmandu the Regional Centre for Peace\r\nand Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific. We have\r\nasked the Secretariat to revise the draft host country\r\nagreements so that they are consistent with diplomatic\r\npractices and with the provisions for the other two\r\ncentres.\r\nPoverty is by far the most entrenched threat to\r\npeace and human dignity, and development is the most\r\ndaunting challenge for the world. The global\r\ncommunity must act together to lift people in\r\ndeveloping countries from the perils of hunger,\r\nignorance, disease and despair. We must create jobs\r\nand opportunities to enable people to lead a decent life\r\nand to raise their stakes in peace and order. Nepal has\r\naccorded the highest priority to poverty alleviation in\r\nits current plan, modelled after the Poverty Reduction\r\nStrategy Papers. Broad-based growth, social sector\r\ndevelopment, targeted programmes and good\r\ngovernance constitute the strategy of the plan. We have\r\nliberalized our economy to foster broader partnership\r\nwith the private sector, non-governmental\r\norganizations and community groups and provide a\r\nwider space for foreign investment.\r\nImprovements in the agriculture and social\r\nsectors as well as in rural infrastructure constitute the\r\ncore of our quest for poverty reduction and sustainable\r\ndevelopment. However, Nepal lacks sufficient\r\nresources to achieve its development objectives. Our\r\nresource constraints have become more acute due to\r\nMaoist insurgency and consequent economic\r\ndisruption. Many other developing countries are in a\r\nsimilar situation.\r\nThe global community must join forces, in a\r\nspirit of partnership, to eradicate absolute poverty and\r\nstimulate development in developing nations. Indeed,\r\nthe Millennium Summit and global conferences on\r\nfinancing, sustainable development, HIV/AIDS and\r\ntrade have clearly laid down the way forward. We must\r\nensure that these compacts do not fail in the crucible of\r\nimplementation.\r\nAs developing countries lead efforts for their\r\nprogress, development partners must keep their\r\ncommitments by meeting development assistance\r\ntargets and providing debt relief to the highly indebted\r\npoor countries, including the least developed nations.\r\nIncreasing development assistance alone,\r\nhowever, will do little to help developing countries\r\nunless rich nations dismantle their farm subsidies and\r\npull down their tariff and non-tariff barriers to products\r\nfrom the South. Improved access to world markets is\r\ncritical for poor nations to attract investment, remove\r\ntheir supply-side constraints and transform their\r\neconomies. In this context, the Cancun trade talks must\r\nbe resumed soon and in such a manner that\r\nglobalization brings benefits to the poor as well.\r\nHis Majesty’s Government is grateful to the\r\nWorld Trade Organization for deciding to admit Nepal\r\nand Cambodia as new members. That is just the first\r\nstep. Nepal needs, as other least developed countries\r\ndo, duty-free and quota-free access to, and increased\r\nassistance from, rich nations to escape the poverty trap\r\nand to integrate itself into the global economy.\r\nLandlocked developing countries face geographic\r\nhandicaps and remoteness from the major corridors of\r\nglobal commerce. We welcome the fact that the Almaty\r\nProgramme of Action addresses their problem and we\r\n40\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nthank the transit and development partners for making\r\nthe ministerial meeting a success. We urge all sides to\r\nmake concerted efforts to implement the Almaty\r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nDemocracy, fairness and the rule of law are the\r\nbuilding blocks of secure peace at home and across the\r\nworld. With this in view, Nepal has embraced\r\npluralistic democracy, constitutional monarchy, and the\r\ninviolability of human rights and freedoms as the\r\ndefining features in our present Constitution.\r\nOur pledge to these values and ideals remains as\r\nstrong as ever. Parliamentary elections postponed due\r\nto the Maoist threat will be held as soon as possible,\r\nand immediate steps will be taken to restore and\r\nreactivate local authorities. The Government is\r\nseriously committed to doing this.\r\nThe Government has accorded high priority to\r\nraising the status of women, children and\r\ndisadvantaged people, as well as to preventing\r\ntrafficking in women. It has established juvenile courts\r\nand strengthened the court system, and has tried to give\r\nthe human rights protection and anti-corruption\r\nagencies the necessary tools and resources to do their\r\njob.\r\nNepal firmly believes that the world community\r\nshould try its level best to promote democracy, justice\r\nand fairness in world trade, global governance and\r\ninternational relations. In this spirit, we underscore the\r\nimperative need for change in the global trade regime,\r\nfor reform in the international financial architecture\r\nand for help to developing countries to overcome their\r\nproblems.\r\nSpeaking of justice, nearly 100,000 Bhutanese\r\nrefugees living in camps in Nepal have been waiting\r\nfor over a decade to return home in safety and dignity.\r\nWe hope Bhutan will show more flexibility in the\r\nbilateral negotiations to find an early and just\r\nsettlement. We call on the world community, including\r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner\r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR), to help create a climate\r\nconducive for resolving this distressing humanitarian\r\nproblem by sustaining its interest and assistance for the\r\nmaintenance of the refugees at this crucial juncture.\r\nNo organization can stand the test of time unless\r\nit is prepared to carry out bold reforms. Events in the\r\nrun-up to the Iraq war have shown the frailty of the\r\nUnited Nations and underlined the imperative for\r\nimmediate and balanced reforms for the Organization\r\nto secure more legitimacy, not only in the eyes of the\r\nrich but also in the perception of the poor.\r\nWhile we welcome the reforms the General\r\nAssembly adopted last year, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to set up a high-level panel to seek\r\nways to make the United Nations a vibrant, effective\r\nand efficient Organization, which can come to grips\r\nwith emerging challenges.\r\nAs we see it, it is imperative for the General\r\nAssembly to reclaim its primacy at the United Nations\r\nand for the Economic and Social Council to make its\r\nwork more visible and relevant to ordinary people. To\r\nachieve these objectives, we must not only rationalize\r\nthe agendas of those organs but also ensure that they\r\nadopt fewer but more relevant resolutions —\r\nresolutions that could be implemented to benefit\r\nhumanity.\r\nReforms are long overdue to make the Security\r\nCouncil more democratic in its work and more\r\nrepresentative in its structure. Nepal expresses its deep\r\nconcern at the lack of tangible progress for over a\r\ndecade on the issue of Council enlargement and urges\r\nall Member States to scale up their efforts to achieve\r\nthat goal. In our view, the Non-Aligned Movement\r\nshould play an active role in United Nations reform. It\r\nshould also work closely with the G-77 to advance\r\ntheir shared agenda in this and other respects.\r\nIn South Asia, as elsewhere, we view regional\r\ncooperation as an instrument of South-South\r\ncooperation for collective progress in the region and\r\nthe world at large. The South Asian Association for\r\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) has been inspired by\r\nthat aspiration. Let us hope our region can put its\r\npolitical differences behind it and steam ahead to find\r\nthe place South Asia deserves in the community of\r\nnations.\r\nIf our immediate and overriding preoccupation at\r\nhome is the restoration of peace, our commitment to\r\nregional cooperation and a just and secure world\r\nconstitutes an objective of equal order. The world has\r\nwitnessed the resilience of the Nepalese people during\r\nthe difficult periods in our history. We remain equally\r\ncommitted today to overcome the current challenge. I\r\ncall on friends and well-wishers of Nepal for greater\r\nunderstanding and cooperation to help us help\r\nourselves in our onward journey to peace and progress.\r\n41\r\nA/58/PV.16\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker in the general debate for\r\nthis meeting. A representative has asked to speak in\r\nright of reply.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with\r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, statements in\r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes\r\nfor the first intervention and to 5 minutes for the\r\nsecond and should be made by delegations from their\r\nseats.\r\nMr. Requeijo Gual (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nThe delegation of Cuba has listened attentively to the\r\naddress of the Czech Republic and regrets that it has\r\nbeen used to attack Cuba. In the trials in March and\r\nApril 2003 that were mentioned in this speech, a group\r\nof mercenaries who were paid and instructed by the\r\nUnited States in its political and economic warfare\r\nagainst Cuba and who were repeatedly violating our\r\nlaws, were judged and punished with all guarantees of\r\ndue process by regular courts and according to pre-\r\nexisting laws.\r\nNumerous penal codes in Europe and in the\r\nUnited States describe and punish severely this conduct\r\nas being “acts committed by organizations under\r\nforeign control”. Many States have laws as antidotes\r\nsanctioning cooperation with foreign Powers.\r\nThe Czech Republic is a tool for the United\r\nStates to use against Cuba. This has repeatedly\r\noccurred in the Commission on Human Rights. To that\r\nend, Czech-accredited diplomats, parliamentarians and\r\nother envoys frequently violate our laws. The Cuban\r\nGovernment regrets that the Czech address did not\r\neven mention the fact that the North American\r\nblockade of Cuba is a massive, flagrant and systematic\r\nviolation of the human rights of Cubans.\r\nIt has not been said, even now, that the blockade\r\nhas become more severe and its territorial scope\r\nexpanded, nor that there is manipulation of the limited\r\nCuban purchases of foodstuffs in the United States,\r\nwhose rigid restrictions and obstacles impede free trade\r\nand confirm the genocidal nature of a blockade that,\r\nflying in the face of international humanitarian law,\r\nincludes medicine and foodstuffs.\r\nMy delegation regrets that the Czech address\r\nomitted the grave, systematic violation of human rights\r\nin occupied Cuban territory, that is to say the naval\r\nbase of Guantanamo, where the United States subjects\r\nto inhuman conditions and practices torture upon the\r\nso-called illegal combatants, including some children\r\nand citizens of dozens of countries, including European\r\ncountries that are being kept in limbo now for more\r\nthan one year.\r\nThe Cuban delegation is duty-bound to state that\r\na country in which there is discrimination, repression\r\nand ghettoization of a gypsy minority, where\r\nxenophobia, violence and murder of immigrants and\r\ngypsies go unpunished, where there is public tolerance\r\nof racism and neofacism, where police brutality is\r\ntolerated, as are the arbitrary arrests of demonstrators,\r\nwhere detainees are refused contact with attorneys and\r\ninformation is denied their families, where dozens of\r\ndetainees have died in suspicious circumstances, where\r\nthe foreign residence laws permit police harassment of\r\nforeigners, where there are inhuman conditions and\r\nhunger strikes in the prisons, where the sex trade and\r\npedophilia increase each day — such a country does\r\nnot have a shred of moral authority to back their\r\ncriticism of Cuba.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.10 p.m.\r\n"
