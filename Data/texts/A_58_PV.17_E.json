Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of\r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, was escorted into the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Emomali Rakhmonov, the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Tajikistan, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rakhmonov (spoke in Russian):\r\nExactly 10 years ago today, the Head of Tajikistan\r\naddressed world leaders for the first time from the high\r\nrostrum of the General Assembly. At that moment,\r\nfollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, our country\r\nwas taking its first steps as an equal member of the\r\ncommunity of nations.\r\nThe establishment of Tajikistan as a modern,\r\ndemocratic, secular State coincided with the emergence\r\nof the need to search for our own ways of interacting\r\nefficiently in a rapidly changing world. Against the\r\nbackground of the inter-Tajik conflict, we had but little\r\ntime to find effective methods of dealing with the huge\r\npolitical, social and economic problems of the\r\ntransitional period.\r\nToday, full of pride in the peace-loving,\r\nindustrious and talented people of Tajikistan, I am able\r\nreport to the representatives of the world’s countries\r\nthat we have emerged with dignity from the toughest\r\ntrial that has ever befallen our nation. It stands to\r\nreason that Tajikistan, its people and its statehood were\r\nable to withstand that trial largely thanks to support of\r\nthe international community. The United States,\r\nRussia, China, Japan, India and Iran, the European\r\nUnion and Central Asia States and many other\r\ncountries, large and small, supported the young Tajik\r\nState during that dramatic period of our history. The\r\nUnited Nations played a special role in this process.\r\nTajikistan greatly appreciates this support, and is\r\nstriving in turn to be a responsible member of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nA decade may not be sufficient time to take full\r\nstock of progress made on an international or national\r\nscale. However, trying to understand the lessons of the\r\nmultifaceted and dramatic events at the turn of this\r\ncentury could be very useful to our common quest to\r\nmake lasting improvements to the world order.\r\nFor Tajikistan, the main lesson to be drawn is\r\nclear: the future lies with democracy within sovereign\r\nState borders and with the democratization of\r\ninternational political and economic relations. The\r\nlesson to be drawn is that establishing a democratic\r\nsociety is in many ways the same for all countries, but\r\neach case is also unique. Our own experience has\r\nshown that today there are no countries or peoples\r\nunwilling to accept democracy or unprepared for it.\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nThe peoples of Asia cherish the same values as the\r\npeoples of Europe, America or Africa.\r\nIt is also obvious that specific conditions, and\r\neach nation’s historical heritage and cultural traditions,\r\nclearly influence the pace and form of the democratic\r\nprocesses in each country. This issue was thoroughly\r\ndiscussed at the Fifth International Conference of New\r\nor Restored Democracies that was recently held in\r\nMongolia. We believe that its outcome will give a fresh\r\nimpetus to democratic processes everywhere, including\r\nAsia.\r\nEstablishing a democracy should not be\r\nconsidered as being easy to achieve, but rather as an\r\nextremely complex step-by-step process. In this sense,\r\nthe experience of developed democracies is indeed\r\ninvaluable. Nevertheless, even they are still struggling\r\nto strike an optimal balance between the interests of the\r\nState and the individual and resolve the question of\r\nhow to meet the basic needs of their citizens while\r\nrespecting the primacy of the right to private property\r\nin a market economy.\r\nThe people of Tajikistan won their independence\r\nand democracy through enormous suffering and\r\nhardship. Peace prevailed in our country only when we\r\nrecognized that national accord should prevail over\r\npolitical ambitions and military confrontation, as the\r\nhighest goal of society, united not only by common\r\nefforts to survive but also by a strong faith in its\r\ncreative capacity.\r\nThe brightest prospects for Tajikistan lie in a\r\nvision of a future developed democracy and prospering\r\nsecular State, bolstered by a strong civil society.\r\nDuring his visit to Tajikistan last year, Mr. Kofi Annan\r\ncould see the tangible outcome of the United Nations\r\npeacekeeping activities and striking change in the\r\nmood of the people, who now have hope for the future\r\nof their children and their country.\r\nWe are convinced that the democratic processes\r\nin Tajikistan will gain momentum. We have all the\r\nprerequisites for this. The restoration of peace in\r\nTajikistan in 1997 laid a solid foundation for a secular\r\ndemocratic State. The constitution was adopted by a\r\nnational referendum. State bodies of authority have\r\nbeen performing efficiently at all levels, reflecting the\r\nentire spectrum of the extensive political life of the\r\ncountry.\r\nThis does not imply that nothing threatens our\r\nyoung democracy, or that it is invulnerable. As a\r\nPresident who knows the needs and problems of the\r\npeople who have entrusted me with such a high office,\r\nI will be sincere and share some of my thoughts. These\r\nconcern both domestic and international affairs,\r\nincluding relations with the United Nations.\r\nFirst of all, we have no right to discredit the idea\r\nof democracy itself, in which Tajik society continues to\r\nplace its hopes for a better life. However, experience\r\nhas shown that there are no simple recipes for\r\nconverting the political process into economic\r\ndevelopment. Moreover, Tajikistan’s experience\r\ncompellingly demonstrates the need for comprehensive\r\npost-conflict rehabilitation. Enhancing the practical\r\nbenefits of such efforts must be a priority for the\r\nUnited Nations system and the international\r\ncommunity. Conflict zones must be transformed into\r\nareas of stability, and serve as examples to help to\r\nprevent new tragedies.\r\nDonors must make pledges that are responsible,\r\nand do not merely raise hopes. The central coordinating\r\nrole in this respect undeniably falls to the United\r\nNations. We are deeply grateful to the numerous\r\nfriends of Tajikistan, including international financial\r\ninstitutions, for their support. We attach special\r\nimportance to our cooperation with the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme and other United Nations\r\nagencies. We believe that the United Nations Tajikistan\r\nOffice of Peace-building is doing useful work to enable\r\nthe international community to better grasp the positive\r\nchanges in our country and its interests and needs.\r\nNow that Tajikistan has reached a new stage of\r\ndevelopment, we especially appreciate the assistance to\r\nachieve our priority goals. Today, as never before,\r\nTajikistan needs assistance and practical support for\r\neffectively tapping our rich human and natural\r\nresources. We are resolved to making our economy up\r\nto date and competitive, inter alia, in order to overcome\r\npoverty once and for all.\r\nI must note with regret that despite the many\r\ngains in international affairs these past years, the\r\ninternational community has still not managed to truly\r\nresolve the problem of poverty. Though the item has\r\nbeen discussed at many conferences and forums, no\r\nspecific actions towards eliminating poverty have\r\nresulted. The growing gap between the rich and poor\r\ncountries is becoming a global challenge and threatens\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nto emerge as the main obstacle to the harmonious\r\ndevelopment of both individual countries and the\r\ncommunity of nations as a whole.\r\nOf course, we must bear the primary burden of\r\naddressing social and economic problems. However,\r\ndeveloping countries are justified in their expectations\r\nfor alleviation of the external difficulties encountered\r\nin integrating into the world economy, which, in our\r\ncase, is connected to access to investment, markets and\r\nhigh technologies. Equally pressing for us are the\r\nproblems of landlocked countries that have long been\r\ndiscussed at international conferences, particularly\r\nclosed borders and the many barriers to the free\r\nexchange of goods, services, capital and labour.\r\nI would like to draw attention to another such\r\nissue: the problem of freshwater. We are glad that\r\nTajikistan’s proposal to proclaim 2003 the International\r\nYear of Freshwater was enthusiastically supported by\r\nthe international community. Experience has shown\r\nthat it was a very timely decision that met the\r\nexpectations of us all. The shortage of freshwater is\r\none of the most urgent concerns of the new\r\nmillennium. Every year the demand for water increases\r\nbecause of the need to produce sufficient food — and I\r\ncan provide statistics in support of that assertion. Some\r\n1.2 billion people have no access to freshwater. More\r\nthan 5 million people die every year from water-related\r\ndiseases. According to estimates of the United Nations\r\nFood and Agriculture Organization, meeting the food\r\nneeds of the growing global population will require a\r\n60 per cent increase in food production over the next\r\n30 years. By 2030, one out of every five developing\r\ncountries will be experiencing enormous difficulties\r\nbecause of current and future water shortages.\r\nA significant investment must be made in\r\nupdating technology and improving water resource\r\nmanagement so as to support economic growth and\r\nlessen the burden of poverty.\r\nGuided by the Water Appeal, which was adopted\r\non 1 September 2003 by the participants of the\r\nInternational Freshwater Forum in Dushanbe, I propose\r\nthat the period 2005-2015 be proclaimed the\r\nInternational Decade of Freshwater.\r\nThe adoption by the General Assembly of a\r\nresolution on this important matter would mean the\r\nlogical extension of the idea of the International Year\r\nof Freshwater. It would also be in keeping with the\r\nprovisions of the Millennium Declaration, which set\r\nthe goal of halving, by 2015, the number of people who\r\nlack access to freshwater and sanitation.\r\nThe International Decade of Freshwater would\r\nallow the international community to continue its focus\r\non the issue of the shortage of water. Water, the\r\ncommon heritage of humankind, is vital for the\r\npreservation of life on Earth and essential for ensuring\r\nsustainable development.\r\nIt is well known that terrorism poses a threat to\r\ndemocracy. Tajikistan has had first-hand experience of\r\nthis problem, as for 10 years we have been a kind of\r\nbuffer zone against the expansion of terror in Central\r\nAsia and other countries. Precisely for that reason,\r\nTajikistan has taken an active part in all efforts to root\r\nout that evil.\r\nWe are equally resolute in our condemnation of\r\nand desire to counteract all forms of terrorism. In this\r\nstruggle, which we can win only through united efforts,\r\nthere can be no selectivity or double standards. It is\r\nclear, however, that terrorism cannot be curbed solely\r\nby military methods. It would be equally erroneous to\r\nbelieve that the phenomenon is rooted in a single\r\nreligion or culture. The rejection of democracy is not\r\nthe only source of terrorism; terrorism also takes\r\nadvantage of injustice and suffering, of the arrogance\r\nof some and the sense of humiliation felt by others.\r\nTerrorism shows up in places where one\r\n“absolute truth” is confronted by another. Although\r\nterrorism has nothing to do with the conflict of\r\ncivilizations, the extension of the dialogue among\r\ncivilizations that was begun by the General Assembly\r\nin 1998 can contribute to better mutual\r\nunderstanding — the lack of which is quite evident.\r\nDialogue is always more constructive than war.\r\nDialogue conducted in all areas will liberate\r\ninternational relations from fear and mistrust and will\r\nmake international cooperation constructive and\r\ncreative.\r\nOur consolidated efforts have dealt a severe blow\r\nto terrorism as an organized phenomenon, but such\r\nefforts have not yet defeated it. One of the lessons\r\nlearned in the course of this struggle — a struggle in\r\nwhich Tajikistan is an active participant — is that\r\ninternational terrorism has no ideology, nation or\r\nhomeland. Furthermore, terrorism cannot exist without\r\nfinancial and logistical support. In this context, we\r\nshould note that democracy is threatened by another\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nphenomenon that is no less frightening — that of drug\r\naggression.\r\nThe illicit trade in drugs has become one of the\r\nmajor sources of financing for international terrorism.\r\nThe urgency and magnitude of the problems related to\r\nthe illicit drug trafficking provide clear proof that this\r\nis a global menace that endangers international stability\r\nand security as a whole.\r\nTajikistan has an extensive border with\r\nAfghanistan, and finds itself in a position between the\r\nworld’s major producer of opium and heroin and the\r\ndrug-consuming countries, to which international\r\norganized crime is smuggling the “white death”.\r\nAs President of Tajikistan, I consider the need to\r\ncurb drug trafficking through my country to be one of\r\nour nation’s top priorities. During his visit to Tajikistan\r\nlast year, the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, had\r\nthe opportunity to observe the great professional skill\r\nand dedication of the staff of the Agency for Drug\r\nControl that has been established there with the support\r\nof the international community.\r\nAccording to United Nations data, Tajikistan is\r\nranked fourth in the world and first in the\r\nCommonwealth of Independent States in terms of the\r\nquantity of drugs withdrawn from trade. As a result of\r\nour efforts in the past four years, more than $1 billion\r\nworth of opiates has been confiscated from drug\r\ndealers.\r\nThe struggle against such narcotic aggression,\r\nwhich generates multibillion dollar profits in countries\r\nlocated far from Tajikistan, will be successful only\r\nthrough the consolidation of collective efforts.\r\nGiven the increased drug threat, and in order to\r\nexpand multilateral cooperation in combating it,\r\nTajikistan proposes the establishment of a global\r\npartnership to counteract the drug threat. Such a\r\nunique, broad anti-drug coalition could become a\r\nreliable barrier to the expansion of this scourge.\r\nThe Secretary-General could become coordinator\r\nof such a partnership, and the United Nations Office\r\nfor Drug Control and Crime Prevention could become\r\nits central executive body. Such a global partnership\r\nwould coordinate all efforts in the field at all levels,\r\nincluding the regional level.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to draw the\r\nattention of Members to another issue that is cause for\r\nconcern. Certain groups of people have been using the\r\nglobal communications media recently in an attempt to\r\nequate such grave threats to humankind as terrorism\r\nand extremism with the holy religion of Islam. Such an\r\ninterpretation represents a distortion of the peaceful\r\nessence of Islam and presents the religion to the\r\ninternational community as a source of evil and\r\nviolence, thus giving rise to hostility towards the entire\r\nMuslim world and encouraging neo-fascist and other\r\ndiscriminatory attitudes.\r\nWe would like once again to stress that the acts of\r\nterror that are being carried out in a number of\r\ncountries are crimes, committed by cruel, merciless\r\npeople who are driven by the lust for power and\r\npersonal gain - people who have nothing to do with the\r\nholy religion of the world’s Muslims.\r\nHumanity must understand that Islam is not a\r\nreligion of violence, but like the world’s other\r\nreligions, calls upon people to show mercy and\r\ncompassion and appeals for peace and harmony.\r\nTajikistan supports increased regional\r\ncooperation in all areas. Our goal is to create a zone of\r\npeace, stability, harmony and prosperity in Central\r\nAsia.\r\nTurning Central Asia into a zone free of weapons\r\nof mass destruction is a matter of principle for\r\nTajikistan, and that is why my country endorsed the\r\nidea of establishing a nuclear weapon-free zone in the\r\nregion.\r\nMeanwhile, I would like to join the common\r\nconcern about increased difficulties related to the non-\r\nproliferation of these types of weapon in the world,\r\nincluding South Asia. I am convinced that the time has\r\ncome not to weaken, but rather to intensify, collective\r\nefforts and expand disarmament mechanisms.\r\nAnother issue has become a challenge of the\r\ntwenty-first century — the increasing number of\r\nterritories aspiring to the status of State but not\r\nrecognized as such by the international community.\r\nThose territories become criminalized from within,\r\nestablish external ties that are not quite legal and\r\nbecome catalysts for regional conflicts.\r\nFor that reason, it is in the interest of the\r\ninternational community to start, in the short term, to\r\ndevelop universal criteria for international recognition\r\nof States. By doing so, it would be possible to prevent\r\nthe provocation of separatist sentiments in certain\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nregions that are fraught with negative consequences for\r\nthe destinies of many peoples and States.\r\nTajikistan notes with satisfaction the considerable\r\nprogress in the revival of Afghanistan. We are\r\nenthusiastic about how the international community is\r\nresolute in its support for processes of national accord\r\nand peace-building in our neighbouring country.\r\nTajikistan is deeply aware of the need to render\r\ninternational support to Afghanistan, and it will\r\nincrease its assistance to the efforts undertaken by the\r\nAfghanistan Government headed by Mr. Hamid Karzai.\r\nMeanwhile, we are persistent in calling on the\r\ninternational community not to lessen its attention to\r\nthe needs of that country, to renew its vigorous\r\ncommitment to rendering support for positive change,\r\nto give fresh impetus to the peace process, making it\r\nirreversible, and to dramatically increase efforts to\r\nuproot drug production in Afghanistan.\r\nGiven the global danger of the drug problem, I\r\nonce again call on the international community and\r\nrelevant international organizations to develop a\r\nunified programme of action aimed at eradicating the\r\nproduction, manufacture and dissemination of drugs in\r\nthat country.\r\nThe situation in Iraq continues to be a cause for\r\npain and concern. Conditions there are still far from\r\nnormal. It is not only a matter of the post-military\r\nenvironment, the lost lives of military personnel, and,\r\neven more sadly, of peaceful citizens. It is a matter of\r\nthe lack of acceptable living conditions for many Iraqi\r\npeople.\r\nThough positive changes are obvious, restoring\r\nIraq’s sovereignty is the greatest priority. We share the\r\nmajority opinion regarding the fact that the Iraqi people\r\nthemselves should determine their future and that the\r\ninternational community, embodied by the United\r\nNations, should be called on to render assistance in the\r\nimplementation of that goal.\r\nEvery people follows its own road to democracy.\r\nHowever, only together can we deal with the\r\nchallenges and the threats we face on this path.\r\nThe United Nations remains the ultimate, indeed\r\nunique, mechanism for taking collective action to\r\naddress global issues. The noble goals for human\r\ndevelopment set out in the Millennium Declaration,\r\nwhich Tajikistan joined in signing, is convincing proof\r\nof that. The United Nations has united almost all\r\ncountries of the world. All of us, the United Nations\r\nfounding Member States and recently admitted\r\nMember States, pledged to observe its Charter. And\r\nthat is the way it should be.\r\nOur Organization is currently experiencing\r\nanother test — the search for efficient answers in new\r\ncircumstances with new requirements for world\r\ndevelopment. The point is that the Organization and its\r\nmajor bodies should keep up with the processes\r\noccurring in a constantly changing world. Though\r\nreform of the United Nations is under way, the time has\r\ncome to channel the practical activities of all its bodies\r\ninto real priorities.\r\nIn the field of international peace and security,\r\nthe focus should be on the prevention of military\r\nconflicts, both intergovernmental and internal.\r\nThe General Assembly, the Economic and Social\r\nCouncil and all other components of the United\r\nNations system are faced with the need to find\r\nconvincing answers to the globalization process, in\r\norder to bridge the gap between the industrialized and\r\nthe developing countries.\r\nWe expect improved professional skills from\r\nSecretariat staff members and increased practical\r\noutcome of their work and of the work of all United\r\nNations agencies, for the benefit of all Member States.\r\nThe feeling that the United Nations is going\r\nthrough a crisis that materialized at some point is\r\nalready fading. It is being substituted by an awareness\r\nof the need to strengthen the Organization, as well as\r\nfor collective interaction within its framework. The\r\npreservation and the development of the Organization\r\nis our common goal, as the international community\r\nhas no another similar universal mechanism.\r\nThe United Nations is the heritage of all\r\nhumanity. Tajikistan will be resolute in doing\r\neverything possible for the successful implementation\r\nof the noble mission of the United Nations for the\r\nbenefit of all mankind.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic\r\nof Tajikistan for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emomali Rakhmonov, President of the\r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, was escorted from the\r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Simeon de Saxe-Coburg-Gotha,\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Bulgaria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria.\r\nMr. Simeon de Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Prime\r\nMinister of the Republic of Bulgaria, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Simeon de Saxe-\r\nCoburg-Gotha, Prime Minister of the Republic of\r\nBulgaria, and inviting him to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Bulgaria) (spoke in\r\nFrench): Allow me, at the outset, to congratulate you\r\non your election to the presidency of the fifty-eighth\r\nsession of the General Assembly. This session will be\r\none of the most decisive ones for the United Nations.\r\nIn that spirit, I welcomed the call of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to heads of State and Government to actively\r\nparticipate in the work of this session.\r\nI have come to New York to solemnly reiterate\r\nBulgaria’s steadfast support for the United Nations. Its\r\nprinciples, objectives and the spirit of solidarity that\r\ninspires it are at the very core of my country’s foreign\r\npolicy. I should like to pay sincere tribute to the\r\nremarkable efforts of the men and women who work\r\nfor the Organization in every corner of the world. The\r\nterrorist attack against the United Nations in Baghdad\r\non 19 August reminded us that nothing that we wish to\r\ndo through the United Nations would be possible\r\nwithout the self-sacrifice of those people. I take this\r\nopportunity to honour the memory of Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello and his colleagues, and I express once again the\r\nmost sincere condolences of the people of Bulgaria to\r\ntheir families.\r\nThe barbaric act of 19 August sounded the alarm:\r\nterrorism is far from being vanquished; the vigilance of\r\nall United Nations Member States must be redoubled\r\nand the effectiveness of their efforts tripled. Indeed, the\r\nvery function of the Security Council’s Counter-\r\nTerrorism Committee cannot truly be effective unless it\r\nis supported by regional and subregional organizations.\r\nIt is a question of creating a genuine global anti-\r\nterrorist action network in which a high-priority role\r\nnaturally devolves to the European Union, to the North\r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and to the\r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\r\n(OSCE). In my view, it is important that all United\r\nNations Member States sign and ratify as soon as\r\npossible the 12 Conventions related to the fight against\r\nterrorism, as the Republic of Bulgaria has done,\r\nwithout, however, forgetting to address the origin —\r\nindeed, the root causes — of these desperate acts.\r\nAt the end of this year, Bulgaria will conclude its\r\ntwo-year mandate as a non-permanent member of the\r\nSecurity Council. The conjunction of circumstances\r\ncaused our Council membership to coincide with a\r\nparticularly dynamic — indeed, dramatic — phase in\r\ninternational life, during which the very credibility of\r\nthe United Nations was put to the test. It is obviously\r\ntoo early to draw all the possible conclusions from that\r\nexperience, but one thing is clear: peace and stability in\r\nthe world need the United Nations now more than ever\r\nbefore. In other words, there is no alternative to the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe note that the credibility of the United Nations,\r\nand particularly of the Security Council, have been\r\ncalled into question each time Member States have\r\nseen their unity shaken. It is in that spirit that Bulgaria\r\nis doing its best to avoid the pitfalls of discord.\r\nWe fervently hope that the Council’s unity will be\r\nrestored on the thorny Iraqi issue. The stability and\r\nprosperity of Iraq — which is emerging from a\r\nferocious dictatorship — are in the interest of the entire\r\ninternational community. Contributing to the country’s\r\nstabilization in a concrete way, Bulgaria is working at\r\nthe diplomatic level to find a formula that will enable\r\nthe Iraqis to recover their sovereignty as swiftly as\r\npossible through a central and important United\r\nNations role in the political process under way in the\r\ncountry.\r\nIt is essential that the Council be able to provide\r\nthe United Nations a clear and realistic mandate that\r\nwould facilitate the mission of the Secretary-General\r\nand his associates in Iraq — a mission that is already\r\nextremely complex and perilous. I believe that the\r\nprovisional Governing Council represents the\r\ninternational community’s best partner for helping the\r\nIraqis to rebuild their country. In that context, Bulgaria\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nhopes to resume its traditional friendly relations with\r\nIraq.\r\nMy Government is very concerned as a result of\r\nevents in the Middle East. The road map elaborated by\r\nthe Quartet remains valid and must be implemented by\r\nthe parties concerned. The Government of Bulgaria\r\nreiterates its appeal to the Palestinian Authority to fully\r\nmeet its obligations under the road map to stop suicide\r\nattacks against civilians. We call on the Israeli\r\nGovernment to stop extrajudicial executions and to\r\nrenounce its plans to expel President Yasser Arafat.\r\nAlthough South-Eastern Europe is experiencing a\r\nperiod of peace, accelerated development and better\r\nprospects for integration into European and Euro-\r\nAtlantic institutions, there are still points of tension\r\nthat cannot be ignored. Obviously, I am thinking of the\r\nsituation in Kosovo, where the United Nations is\r\nplaying an irreplaceable role. Bulgaria hopes for a\r\nmulti-ethnic, democratic and prosperous Kosovo, as\r\nenvisaged by Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).\r\nThe recent acts of violence make us think that the\r\nenemies of that particular Kosovo have not given up. I\r\nshould like to take this opportunity to emphasize the\r\nimportance that my country attaches to respect for and\r\nprotection of religious monuments in Kosovo. I can\r\naffirm that the solution to the Kosovo problem can be\r\nfound in dialogue — particularly dialogue between\r\nPristina and Belgrade — that respects the right of all\r\nthe province’s inhabitants to live in peace, whatever\r\ntheir ethnic affiliation.\r\nTwo years after having had the opportunity to\r\nspeak before the General Assembly, I have the\r\nprivilege to share with Members Bulgaria’s significant\r\nprogress in attaining its principal foreign policy\r\nobjective: joining the European Union and NATO. In\r\n2004, Bulgaria will become a member of the Atlantic\r\nAlliance. We are about to conclude negotiations with\r\nthe European Union with a view to acceding to it on 1\r\nJanuary 2007. Such progress will enable my country to\r\nbe even more effective in the implementation of the\r\nprinciples and ideals of the Charter of the United\r\nNations.\r\nBeginning 1 January 2004, Bulgaria will assume\r\nthe chairmanship of the OSCE for one year. The\r\nBulgarian chairmanship of that important regional body\r\nwill devote priority attention to cooperation with the\r\nUnited Nations. In our view, the experience\r\naccumulated by the OSCE with regard to organizing\r\nand observing free and democratic elections could be\r\nas useful to the United Nations as to other regional\r\nforums. The defence and consolidation of human rights\r\nare naturally part of our priorities.\r\nIt is difficult for me to conclude without\r\nmentioning what I believe to be the main thread\r\nrunning through the discourse in this Hall — the future\r\nof the United Nations. One thing is certain: at a time of\r\nglobalization, the sole institution of multilateralism\r\nthat is universal in nature is in fact irreplaceable. The\r\ngreat issues of the modern world - international peace\r\nand security, the fight against poverty and for\r\ndevelopment, the defence and promotion of human\r\nrights, and protection of the environment and of human\r\nhealth — cannot find lasting solutions except through\r\nthe efforts of, and within the framework of, the United\r\nNations.\r\nIt goes without saying that the United Nations can\r\nmeet these formidable challenges only if it undergoes a\r\nprofound process of reform. Reform must be\r\nundertaken without violating the principles or spirit of\r\nthe Charter. It must be carried out with determination,\r\nbut not in haste.\r\nThe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has\r\nidentified the genuine problems that we, the Member\r\nStates, must tackle. As always, he has asked the right\r\nquestions. My Government supports his efforts to assist\r\nMember countries in crafting a clear and far-sighted\r\nvision of the future of the United Nations, in particular\r\nby means of his idea of appointing a group of eminent\r\npersonalities to provide ideas for such reforms.\r\nBulgaria is ready to participate in that act of collective\r\nreflection, which will require both courage and\r\nwisdom.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the\r\nRepublic of Bulgaria for the statement he has just\r\nmade.\r\nMr. Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Prime Minister\r\nof the Republic of Bulgaria, was escorted from\r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the\r\nRepublic of Colombia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an\r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted into the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United\r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia, and to invite\r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Uribe Vélez (spoke in Spanish): I\r\nshould like to congratulate you, Sir, upon your election\r\nas President of the General Assembly, and to wish you\r\nevery success in the performance of your duties.\r\nDespite the anxiety that we feel in the face of the\r\nterrorism that is affecting so many countries, we\r\nreaffirm our commitment to fight that scourge until we\r\nhave defeated it. Colombia reaffirms its faith in\r\nmultilateralism as the most effective system through\r\nwhich to seek peace, security and human, economic\r\nand social development. The United Nations is\r\nirreplaceable, even if, for the good of the humanity, its\r\nstructure and procedures must be constantly updated so\r\nas to increase the efficiency of its anti-terrorism\r\nactivities.\r\nThe United Nations itself recently suffered a\r\nterrorist attack, an act that resulted in the death of\r\nSergio Vieira de Mello, a tireless campaigner for the\r\ncoexistence of peoples. We deeply regret the loss of\r\nthose who have sacrificed their lives as they worked to\r\nput an end to terrorism. Our obligation to reciprocate is\r\nall the greater as a result of the solidarity expressed by\r\nthe United Nations towards Colombia.\r\nA year ago in the General Assembly I set out my\r\ndemocratic security policy, developed to free the\r\nColombian people from terrorism. That policy is\r\ndesigned to protect the rights of all citizens, regardless\r\nof their social or economic status, political ideas or\r\nreligious beliefs. The policy affords equal protection to\r\nbusiness and union leaders as well as Government and\r\nopposition politicians. It is based on the dream of a\r\npluralist nation that shares in an ongoing constructive\r\ndebate in a spirit of brotherhood and without hatred.\r\nIn an area of Colombia covering almost 1.2\r\nmillion square kilometres, about 400,000 of them\r\nconsisting of jungle, terrorists have taken advantage of\r\nthe absence of a State presence in many places. A year\r\nago, out of a total of 1,100 municipalities, 170 did not\r\nhave a police presence. That number has been reduced\r\nto 151, and we hope to extend coverage to all the\r\nmunicipalities within a few weeks. Hundreds of smaller\r\ntowns, however, lack a police force. We now have\r\nsoldiers and marines — known as soldiers of the\r\npeople — in 439 municipalities, under a programme\r\nthat allows them to carry out their military service in\r\ntheir home town. The results thus far have been\r\npositive, and when the soldiers have completed their\r\nactive duty, we hope to rely on them as permanent law-\r\nenforcement leaders.\r\nSuch efforts, together with others that we have\r\nundertaken in similar areas, must continue so that the\r\nGovernment can rid the country of terrorism.\r\nI would like to share with the Assembly some of\r\nthe achievements of my Administration during the first\r\nnine months of this year. The murder rate has\r\ndecreased by 22 per cent when compared with the same\r\nperiod in 2002 — down from 21,253 to 16,531. The\r\ntotal of 1,485 kidnappings represents a reduction of\r\n34.7 per cent over the same period last year; the\r\nnumber of victims of illegal road blocks decreased by\r\n49 per cent, and the number of operations to rescue\r\nkidnapped people increased by 22.8 per cent. But what\r\ncountry could accept 1,485 kidnappings in nine\r\nmonths?\r\nThe number of massacres and the number of their\r\nvictims have decreased by 35 per cent and 41 per cent\r\nrespectively. We will be able to claim victory only\r\nwhen we have completely eliminated these attacks.\r\nEvery terrorist act brings suffering to the whole nation.\r\nFARC carried out the car bombing of the club El\r\nNogal, used a bomb in a boat in the rural town of\r\nPuerto Rico and exploded a truck bomb in the small\r\ntown of Chita. These bombings together killed 47\r\npeople and injured 233. And just a few hours ago, in\r\nFlorencia, another bomb has left 12 dead and wounded\r\n46.\r\nThe number of union members assassinated has\r\ndeclined from 120 to 36. Several of those responsible\r\nare now in jail, as a result of our determination to fight\r\nimpunity. Sixty teachers were murdered in 2002. This\r\nyear, 24 such cases have been reported. The number of\r\njournalists murdered has dropped from 9 to 5.\r\nThe decrease in overall crime is significant, but\r\nthe numbers are still staggering. No country could feel\r\nsafe under such circumstances. I reaffirm our\r\ndemocratic desire to protect, in particular, our teachers,\r\nunion leaders and journalists.\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nI acknowledge with great sorrow that the number\r\nof indigenous people murdered has increased from 72\r\nto 75. Illegal self-defence groups were responsible for\r\n33 of those cases, with various guerrilla groups being\r\nresponsible for the remainder.\r\nDuring the first six months of 2003, 73,586 cases\r\nof forced displacement were reported. This represents a\r\ndecrease of 66 per cent. We are beginning successfully\r\nto return families to where they came from. I reaffirm\r\nour commitment to fight to protect the indigenous\r\ncommunities and to put an end to forced displacement.\r\nOf the 246 mayors who in August 2002 were in\r\nexile from their municipalities as a result of threats,\r\n191 have now returned, thanks to the improved security\r\nsituation. The progress we have made in regard to the\r\nprotection of our citizens encourages us to continue\r\nmaking efforts in that direction.\r\nBetween 7 August 2002 and 7 August 2003,\r\n2,544 members of illegal self-defence groups were\r\ncaptured, which represents an increase of 146 per cent.\r\nThe number of those killed in combat by the armed\r\nforces has increased by 38.7 per cent, the number of\r\nguerrillas captured has increased by 126.3 per cent and\r\nthe number of those killed in combat has increased by\r\n78 per cent.\r\nBecause of my pure democratic conviction, I\r\nreaffirm our commitment to human rights. We have\r\nextended the stay of the Office of the United Nations\r\nCommissioner in Bogota. We agree with many of its\r\nrecommendations. We have no doubt about seeking\r\ntheir implementation, and we will discuss the cases on\r\nwhich we disagree.\r\nOur requirement for the soldiers and the police is\r\nefficiency and respect for human rights. We encourage\r\nand care for our armed forces, as we demonstrated\r\nrecently with the improvement of our social security\r\nsystem. However, we will not hesitate to send to jail\r\nthose who break the law.\r\nThe sacrifice of our soldiers and policemen has\r\nbeen enormous. This year, because of anti-personnel\r\nmines alone, 109 soldiers have been killed and 334\r\nhave been wounded, many of them mutilated for life.\r\nIf we request international support, it is because\r\nwe are open to international monitoring. We respect the\r\nhuman rights organizations and their workers who\r\nproceed seriously and we respect their criticism and\r\nconstructive suggestions. Those organizations\r\ncontribute to improving democratic conditions. That is\r\nwhy we agree with the Human Rights Watch report on\r\nthe recruitment of children by terrorist groups. We\r\nreserve the right, however, to disagree with false\r\nreports which distort our efforts to consolidate a\r\ndemocratic concept of security.\r\nAs the United Nations has acknowledged, we\r\nhave made substantial progress in destroying illicit\r\ndrugs. We have eradicated 70 per cent of illicit crops,\r\nand we will not stop until we rid our country of that\r\nserious scourge. We have authorized the extradition of\r\n94 persons for drug-trafficking crimes.\r\nWe have hired 5,400 families as forest rangers, as\r\npart of our goal to recruit 50,000 families. They receive\r\neconomic compensation to replace illicit crops for the\r\npurpose of replanting and taking care of the rainforest.\r\nMr. Da Fonseca (Cape Verde), (Vice-President),\r\ntook the Chair.\r\nA more effective law designed to confiscate illicit\r\ndrug wealth has allowed for the increase in the number\r\nof rulings in one year from 5 to 68.\r\nIn Colombia’s current situation, terrorism, illicit\r\ndrugs, violence and insecurity are really the same\r\nthing. We plead for a commitment from the world so\r\nthat we are able to completely defeat drugs. We\r\nimplore the world not to harbour our terrorists, to help\r\nus confiscate their goods and to open their doors only\r\nto help peace processes.\r\nOur country is a State based on law. We want to\r\novercome terrorism and be able to look to the\r\ninternational community with the certainty that we\r\nhave acted in strict compliance with the law. In order to\r\nfight impunity, we have incorporated the accusatory\r\npenal system and oral procedure, which will begin in\r\n2005.\r\nAt the present time we are introducing a\r\nconstitutional change to allow the armed forces to\r\nproceed with specialized personnel, in cases of\r\nterrorism, to carry out raids, conduct property searches\r\nand undertake interceptions. Those actions will be\r\nconducted with democratic safeguards, allowing for an\r\nindependent attorney to intervene quickly. The\r\nattorney’s office and Congress will be informed. The\r\nproposed measures are infinitely less rigorous than the\r\ncurrent laws of democracies that do not have the high\r\nlevels of terrorism that we have in Colombia.\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nThis Government found approximately 30,000\r\npeople who belong to illegal terrorist organizations,\r\ndefined in this way because of the nature of their\r\nactions. Consideration and reflection on that figure\r\ndictates the need to continue with a strong authoritarian\r\npolicy and of opening avenues for negotiation once\r\nhostilities have ceased.\r\nI welcome the efforts made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral this past year to seek paths to peace with the\r\nFARC. The Government supports his good offices,\r\nwhich, until now, have been unsuccessful because of\r\nthe lack of willingness on the part of the terrorists.\r\nThat group has kidnapped hundreds of Colombians and\r\nsome foreign citizens, most of whom are kept in\r\nconcentration camps that recall the Nazi era. I reaffirm\r\nto the Secretary-General my commitment to find a\r\nsolution, to be recommended by him, to free the\r\nhostages, under conditions that are in keeping with\r\nlegal norms and that do not intensify violence.\r\nSince the last Colombian Government, we have\r\nsought, through Cuba, on the one hand, and several\r\nadditional Governments on the other, a peace process\r\nwith the National Liberation Army (ELN). We have\r\nmade every effort, which, to date, has been futile. The\r\nleaders of that group who are in jail have received the\r\nbest treatment possible. On 30 June, through a\r\nfacilitation commission, I offered to examine an ELN\r\nprisoner release proposal, in exchange for their\r\nrenunciation of armed activity and their dedication to\r\nhelp achieve peace. I did not get a positive response,\r\nbut I will continue to insist on this.\r\nThe ELN is holding seven foreign citizens whom\r\nit should release, in keeping with its promise to cease\r\nits crimes during the current electoral process.\r\nSince the last Government, we have also sought a\r\npeace process with the illegal paramilitary groups, with\r\nthe mediation of the Catholic Church. The condition is\r\nthe same — the cessation of hostilities. Groups of those\r\norganizations, which represent 10,000 or more people,\r\nhave expressed the willingness to demobilize. The\r\nGovernment is making progress in that process.\r\nDuring my Administration, 2,250 members of\r\nterrorist groups have been demobilized; 70 per cent of\r\nthem belong to the FARC, 18 per cent to the ELN and\r\n12 per cent to illegal paramilitary groups. To\r\nreintegrate members of the various groups into civilian\r\nlife, Colombia requires a judicial framework that\r\nrealistically defines how to achieve justice, repair\r\ndamage to the community and ensure peace. The\r\nalternative sentence proposal, submitted by the\r\nGovernment for congressional consideration, sets forth\r\na legal and transparent procedure that will allow for\r\nprogress towards a negotiated peace solution with the\r\nillegal paramilitary groups, the FARC and the ELN.\r\nI understand the concern raised by offering\r\ndiminished sentences for grave crimes. But, in a\r\ncontext of 30,000 terrorists, it must also be understood\r\nthat a definitive peace is the best justice for a nation in\r\nwhich several generations have never gone through a\r\nsingle day without experiencing an act of terrorism.\r\nThe proposal has prompted national and\r\ninternational controversy. We are looking for the\r\nbroadest possible consensus. We invite everyone to\r\nexamine the various options and to achieve, through\r\nthe process of amendments, the best final text.\r\nWe have no doubt about defeating terrorism.\r\nHowever, there are times that call for adjusting the\r\nequation between justice and peace in order to reach a\r\nconsolidated peace.\r\nWe agree with what was expressed by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, who has proposed an excellent\r\nbalance between the need for justice and the need to\r\nsave innocent lives. To protect our communities, we\r\nneed to pursue terrorists relentlessly and not miss\r\nopportunities to obtain peace agreements with them,\r\nprovided that, through their actions, they convince the\r\nColombian people and the world of their good faith and\r\ntheir desire for rectification.\r\nOur problem is an international threat. If\r\nColombia does not destroy illegal drugs, illegal drugs\r\nwill destroy the Amazon Basin. If Colombia does not\r\nstop terrorism, it will jeopardize the democracies of the\r\nregion. The President of Ecuador, Lucio Gutiérrez, and\r\nthe Rio Group, have understood that. The Rio Group\r\nendorsed the proposal that the United Nations continue\r\nto make efforts for negotiations with the Colombian\r\nterrorists, or, if that is not possible, to seek alternatives\r\nto overcome the problem.\r\nOur rule of law calls for a social commitment.\r\nPoverty and inequality have worsened as a result of\r\nterrorism. We are making progress with limited\r\nresources in applying the seven tools for equality: an\r\neducational revolution, expanded social protection, an\r\neconomy based on the principle of solidarity, rural\r\nsocial management, management of public services,\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nbuilding a country of owners and improving the quality\r\nof urban life.\r\nAs examples of this, we have created new\r\ncapacity for 500,000 children in schools, but we still\r\nhave 1.5 million children who do not have access to\r\nprimary education. Microcredit has increased by 50 per\r\ncent, but we are still far from being a country of\r\nowners. The social task is arduous, but with our\r\ncharacteristic determination we will overcome every\r\nobstacle in order to build a just society.\r\nSecurity is the most important human right of the\r\npoor, who need our policy to be successful so that there\r\ncan be peace, confidence, investment, employment and\r\nequity.\r\nAmidst tragedies, the Colombian democracy is\r\nvigorous. On 25 October, our citizens will decide\r\nwhether to accept a referendum to defeat corruption\r\nand to strengthen social investment. And the following\r\nday the people will elect 30 governors from among 133\r\ncandidates; 914 mayors from among 3,441 candidates;\r\n398 deputies from 373 lists composed of 2,723\r\ncandidates; approximately 9,000 municipal council\r\nmembers from 6,105 lists with 56,590 candidates; and\r\nlocal administrative boards from 3,156 lists with\r\n13,387 candidates. Today, we live in a pluralistic and\r\nenthusiastic democracy, despite the challenge of\r\nterrorism.\r\nIt would be a tragedy if the civilized world does\r\nnot unite its efforts once and for all to defeat terrorism\r\nand to support the democracies that are fighting against\r\nit. We need the unity of all democratic people in order\r\nto defeat terror.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On\r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia for the\r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alvaro Uribe Vélez, President of the Republic\r\nof Colombia, was escorted from the General\r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mrs. Sandra Pierantozzi,\r\nVice-President and Minister of Health of the\r\nRepublic of Palau\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now\r\nhear an address by the Vice-President and Minister of\r\nHealth of the Republic of Palau.\r\nMrs. Sandra Pierantozzi, Vice-President and\r\nMinister of Health of the Republic of Palau, was\r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in\r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Mrs. Sandra Pierantozzi,\r\nVice-President and Minister of Health of the Republic\r\nof Palau, and inviting her to address the General\r\nAssembly.\r\nMrs. Pierantozzi (Palau): I bring to the\r\nAssembly greetings and good wishes from the\r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau, Tommy E.\r\nRemengesau, Jr., and from the people and the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of Palau.\r\nNearly 60 years ago, in his final inaugural\r\naddress, United States President Franklin Delano\r\nRoosevelt reflected on the lessons of the first half of\r\nthe twentieth century. He said:\r\n“We have learned that we cannot live alone,\r\nat peace; that our own well-being is dependent on\r\nthe well-being of other nations far away. ... We\r\nhave learned to be citizens of the world, members\r\nof the human community.”\r\nThose words have more resonance today than ever\r\nbefore as Palau and the rest of the world enter into the\r\ntwenty-first century. The Republic of Palau is enjoying\r\nrapid development, which came with its independence\r\non 1 October nine years ago. However, at a time of\r\nrapid globalization, when events halfway around the\r\nworld — and most recently in our own backyard — can\r\nprofoundly affect our safety and prosperity, Palau\r\nrealizes that it must join the international community in\r\nthis new challenge to protect our people at home and\r\nour way of life.\r\nTo that end, the Republic of Palau reaffirms its\r\nunwavering support for the war led by the United\r\nStates against terrorism. We all benefit when nations\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\ncome together to deter aggression and terrorism, to\r\nresolve conflicts, to prevent the spread of diseases and\r\nthe spread of dangerous weapons, to promote\r\ndemocracy and human rights, to open markets and to\r\ncreate economic and financial stability, to raise living\r\nstandards and to protect the environment — to face\r\nthose myriad challenges that no nation can meet alone.\r\nGlobalization, however, also brings about risks.\r\nOutlaw States and ethnic conflicts threaten regional\r\nstability and progress in many important areas of the\r\nworld. Weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, drug\r\ntrafficking and other international crimes are global\r\nconcerns that transcend national borders. Other\r\nproblems originating overseas — such as the depletion\r\nof resources, rapid population growth, environmental\r\ndamage, new infectious diseases such as severe acute\r\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS), pervasive corruption\r\nand uncontrolled refugee migration — have\r\nincreasingly significant implications for every nation’s\r\nsecurity. National economies will suffer if the global\r\neconomy is unstable or if markets collapse, and the\r\nhighest environmental standards — such as those set\r\nout in the Kyoto Protocol — will not protect small,\r\nstruggling island countries like Palau if other countries\r\ndo not join the global effort to bring about peace and\r\nstability.\r\nProtection of the environment is a major concern\r\nto us. Decisions made today regarding the environment\r\nand natural resources can affect every nation’s security\r\nfor generations. Environmental threats do not respect\r\nnational borders, but they can pose long-term dangers\r\nfor every nation’s security and well-being. Scarcity and\r\ndepletion of natural resources can trigger and\r\nexacerbate conflict. Environmental threats — such as\r\nclimate change, the depletion of stratospheric ozone,\r\nthe introduction of nuisance plant and animal species,\r\nthe overharvesting of fish and of other living natural\r\nresources, and the transnational movement of\r\nhazardous chemicals and waste — directly threaten the\r\nhealth and economic well-being of every people of the\r\nworld. For Palau, the immediate danger is the rise in\r\nsea level.\r\nAnother issue that we wish to address is that of\r\nthe cloning of human beings. We believe that any\r\nglobal and comprehensive ban on human cloning must\r\ninclude a ban on the cloning of human embryos for\r\nresearch purposes. While the goal of finding cures to\r\nchronic illnesses is laudable, progress and economic\r\ngain achieved by creating and destroying human life\r\ncome at too high a price. We believe that adult-stem-\r\ncell research is a promising field of study that can\r\nprovide an ethical source of stem cells for scientific\r\ninvestigation. The international community must not\r\nallow human life to be devalued in any way, and we\r\nencourage all States to adopt such measures as may be\r\nnecessary to prohibit techniques of genetic engineering\r\nthat may have adverse consequences on respect for\r\nhuman dignity.\r\nIn public health, we note that many peoples\r\naround the world are suffering and dying each day\r\nfrom the scourges of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria,\r\ncancer, polio and similar diseases. Combined\r\ninternational support for public health beyond the\r\nclinic walls must be advocated and put into practice if\r\nwe are to eliminate some of those challenges to quality\r\nhuman life.\r\nSuch international support and collaborative\r\nefforts were recently manifested during the spread of\r\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). I also urge\r\nall members of this body to support and ratify the\r\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control adopted by\r\nthe World Health Assembly this year. More\r\nimportantly, we should combine our efforts to\r\nimplement the mission of the Convention to control\r\ntobacco use, which contributes to diseases and death\r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe United Nations is to truly represent all\r\npeoples, with discrimination and exclusion eliminated\r\nfrom its operational practice. To be effective at\r\nensuring international peace and security, all nations,\r\nlarge and small, must be represented in the United\r\nNations. The Republic of China on Taiwan can no\r\nlonger be kept on the sidelines of the most important\r\ninternational Organization and the leading forum for\r\ninternational dialogue. Over the past half-century, the\r\nhard-working people of Taiwan have transformed their\r\ncountry into the world’ s seventeenth largest economy\r\nand a vibrant democracy. In 1996, Taiwan had its first\r\ndirect presidential election and, in 2000, accomplished\r\nits first peaceful transfer of executive powers. Since\r\nthen Taiwan’s popularly-elected Government has acted\r\nin accordance with United Nations resolutions to\r\ncombat international terrorism and to support\r\nhumanitarian relief in countries throughout the world,\r\nand yet it is still excluded from the process. Our\r\nexperience with SARS has shown us that exclusion can\r\nbring no benefits to anyone. The 23 million Taiwanese\r\npeople have an equal right to a voice in the United\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nNations and should be welcomed by all members of\r\nthis body.\r\nThe central purpose of the United Nations is the\r\npreservation and advancement of world peace. It\r\naccomplishes its peacemaking and humanitarian\r\nassistance efforts through international cooperation. Its\r\n191 Member States, large and small, rich and poor, and\r\nwith different political views, strive collectively to\r\naddress global challenges and advance world peace.\r\nTogether, they consider and decide on the world’s most\r\npressing problems. Thus, in this regard I ask the world\r\nhere today, at the fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly, to study and discuss the roots of terrorism\r\nand possible solutions, including inter-religious\r\nintervention; to promote conservation standards to\r\nprotect our Earth’s environment; to promote world\r\npublic health; to protect the human dignity by banning\r\nthe cloning of human embryos; and to continue our\r\nquest for peace and security for all peoples of the\r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General\r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President and\r\nMinister of Health of the Republic of Palau for her\r\nstatement.\r\nMrs. Sandra Pierantozzi, Vice-President and\r\nMinister of Health of the Republic of Palau, was\r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Somsavat\r\nLengsavad, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Lengsavad (Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic): Let me convey my congratulations to\r\nMr. Julian Hunte on his election to the presidency of\r\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. We are\r\nconfident that this Assembly stands to benefit greatly\r\nfrom his diplomatic experience and skills. Like others,\r\nI pledge the full support and cooperation of the Lao\r\ndelegation to him as he undertakes his duties and\r\nexpress the hope that our deliberations on many of the\r\nmost pressing world issues will be fruitful.\r\nSince the last time we convened, the world has\r\ngone through major changes and challenges. Although\r\npeace, dialogue and cooperation for development\r\ncontinue to prevail today across many regions, we have\r\nbeen bearing witness to a world beset by terror, civil\r\nwars, armed conflicts and violence, acts of aggression\r\nand interference in the internal affairs of States. In\r\nhandling these problems, we believe it is incumbent\r\nupon all of us to show patience, courage and\r\ndetermination and to strive to solve them through\r\ndialogue, diplomacy and political means. Towards that\r\nend, we should continue to seek multilateral routes\r\nthrough the United Nations. In this regard, we should\r\nlike to make special mention of Secretary-General Kofi\r\nAnnan. While we wish him more success as he\r\nendeavours to defend and promote the principles and\r\nideals of this universal Organization, we can only\r\nexpress great appreciation for the efforts he has made.\r\nAt present, the problems plaguing our planet,\r\nalas, are not limited to those considered to be political\r\nor military. There are also those that affect the\r\nenvironmental, social and economic fronts. More\r\nstriking are the issues of global warming, pollution,\r\nnatural disasters, HIV/AIDS, incurable diseases,\r\npoverty and underdevelopment, the crises of refugees,\r\ndebt and economic stagnation, which have yet to find\r\neffective solutions. The severity of these problems is\r\neven more acute in a globalized world in which the gap\r\nbetween developed and developing countries is\r\nwidening.\r\nWe should therefore strive effectively to address\r\nthese problems in order to meet the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals adopted three years ago by this\r\nAssembly. Standing here today and recommitting\r\nourselves to meeting those noble Goals, we want a\r\nworld where poverty and hunger are alleviated; where\r\neducation is offered to every child; where women have\r\nthe same opportunities as men; where incurable\r\ndiseases are effectively combated; and where the world\r\ncontinues to build partnership and cooperation for\r\nsustained economic growth and sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor many years, the land-locked developing\r\ncountries have attached a particular interest to their\r\nspecial needs and problems. As Chairman of the 31-\r\nmember Group of Land-Locked Developing Countries\r\nfor the past four years, the Lao People’s Democratic\r\nRepublic has spared no effort in bringing the special\r\nneeds and problems of land-locked developing\r\ncountries to the forefront of the international arena. As\r\na result of this long-standing concerted effort, the\r\nInternational Ministerial Conference of Landlocked\r\nand Transit Developing Countries and Donor Countries\r\nand International Financial and Development\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nInstitutions on Transit Transport Cooperation was held\r\nlast month in Kazakhstan as the first-ever United\r\nNations conference of its kind. The meeting adopted\r\nthe Almaty Declaration and Programme of Action. We\r\nare delighted that this global Programme of Action\r\naddresses, first and foremost, the special needs and\r\nproblems of the landlocked developing countries, while\r\ntaking into account the legitimate concerns of transit\r\ndeveloping countries. In this respect, all stakeholders\r\nare urged to fully and effectively implement the\r\nAlmaty Programme of Action in the years to come.\r\nSince its inception, the United Nations has\r\nperformed multiple activities in various areas, such as\r\nthe maintenance of peace and security, socio-economic\r\ndevelopment, humanitarian assistance, the promotion\r\nof international law, human rights and the protection of\r\nthe environment. In these endeavours, the United\r\nNations has achieved many successes, including in the\r\nfield of socio-economic development. However, in\r\nmany other areas, still more effort is required in order\r\nto attain better results.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his\r\nannual report this year,\r\n“in the area of peace and security, it has been a\r\ntrying year for the United Nations. The war in\r\nIraq severely tested the principle of collective\r\nsecurity and the resilience of the Organization.”\r\n(A/58/1, para. 2)\r\nIn the light of this, and given the present international\r\nsituation, the Security Council, the main body for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, should\r\nplay its full role in securing peace and security in the\r\nworld, as stipulated in the Charter. The Security\r\nCouncil members, especially the permanent members,\r\nshould do everything possible to ensure that this organ\r\neffectively discharges its duties in the maintenance of\r\npeace and security. A safe and secure world would\r\nenable all nations to better promote their socio-\r\neconomic development. The international community\r\nis therefore urged to deploy serious efforts towards this\r\nend.\r\nIn a world where cooperation for development is\r\nwidespread, where in every region there is economic\r\nintegration to achieve common benefits, it is\r\nregrettable that the economic, commercial and financial\r\nrestrictions imposed on Cuba continue. We reaffirm the\r\nsupport of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic for\r\nthe General Assembly resolution calling for the lifting\r\nof such a restrictive policy, with the aim of benefiting\r\nall peoples in the region as well as the world at large.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, we continue to be\r\ngravely concerned about the ongoing violence and\r\ndisproportionate use of force that have brought nothing\r\nbut destruction and death to both Palestine and Israel.\r\nWe urge the two sides to exercise the utmost restraint\r\nand engage in earnest negotiations so that peace and\r\ncooperation may eventually ensue in the region. If that\r\nis done, by 2005 the inalienable rights of the\r\nPalestinian people to establish an independent and\r\nviable State, living side by side with Israel in peace and\r\nsecurity, could become a reality.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has\r\nfollowed the recent developments in the Korean\r\npeninsula with great attention. We render our full\r\nsupport to the six-party talks hosted in Beijing in\r\nAugust by the Government of China, which contributed\r\nactively. We are pleased with the significant progress\r\nachieved by this meeting. We very much hope that the\r\ndialogue process will be pursued to address the nuclear\r\nissue in parallel with the security of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. This would no doubt\r\ncontribute to the realization of a nuclear-free Korean\r\nPeninsula, the assurance of security for all countries in\r\nNorth-East Asia and the peaceful reunification of the\r\ntwo Koreas.\r\nOver the past year, the Lao people of all ethnic\r\ngroups have pursued their national development in\r\nunity and harmony. We are delighted that, through the\r\npromotion of the untapped potential of all domestic\r\neconomic sectors and the expansion of cooperation\r\nwith the international community, the pace of national\r\neconomic growth has continuously increased; the\r\nlivelihood of the people, particularly those in the rural\r\nareas, has been further improved; and, last but not\r\nleast, political stability and social order have been\r\nensured and strengthened.\r\nIn order to free the country from\r\nunderdevelopment, apart from our domestic effort, we\r\nhave attached great importance to the achievements\r\nmade in our increased effort to implement the regional\r\nintegration of the Association of South-East Asian\r\nNations (ASEAN). We highly value the continued\r\ndevelopment of cooperation between ASEAN and the\r\nPeople’s Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of\r\nKorea, India and other dialogue partners. Furthermore,\r\nwe are pleased with the new chapter in the\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nstrengthening of cooperation between ASEAN and the\r\nUnited States, in particular the signing of the bilateral\r\ntrade agreement between the Governments of the Lao\r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic and the United States in\r\nVientiane on 19 September this year. In this regard, I\r\nwish to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\r\nfriendly countries and international organizations for\r\nthe invaluable assistance and support rendered to the\r\ncause of our national development.\r\nAs it enters this new century, humankind has a\r\nstrong aspiration for peace and cooperation for\r\ndevelopment across the globe. In accordance with the\r\nCharter and international law, we should exert our\r\ncollective efforts to build a better world. In this spirit,\r\nour delegation once again calls for cooperation and\r\nunity in designing and implementing action-oriented\r\nmeasures to tackle the challenges and problems\r\nplaguing our planet. If we do this, future generations\r\nwill commend us for all our efforts in establishing\r\nconditions for their peaceful lives and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the floor to\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Jan Petersen, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Norway.\r\nMr. Petersen (Norway): The brutal attacks on the\r\nUnited Nations Mission in Baghdad are beyond\r\ncomprehension. I condemn them in the strongest\r\npossible terms. The perpetrators of such crimes must be\r\nbrought to justice. We must renew our efforts to bolster\r\nrespect for humanitarian principles. It is unacceptable\r\nthat United Nations personnel are unable to conduct\r\nhumanitarian relief operations without risking their\r\nlives. It is unacceptable that United Nations personnel\r\nare denied access to people in distress.\r\nOn behalf of the people of Norway, I wish to\r\nexpress my respect and admiration to all United\r\nNations workers who are doing what they can to help\r\nin Iraq and other zones of conflict and danger.\r\nUnless the security needs in Iraq are met,\r\nvaluable time on the road to political stability,\r\ndemocracy and economic and social development will\r\nbe lost. Without a safe and secure environment, the\r\nUnited Nations is unable to help Iraq along that road. I\r\ndeplore the political assassinations of religious and\r\npolitical leaders in Iraq.\r\nNow we must focus our attention on what is\r\nneeded to rebuild Iraq. Norway is participating in\r\ninternational efforts to stabilize and rebuild Iraq for the\r\nbenefit of the Iraqi people. Our aim is to help the\r\npeople of Iraq regain control of their own destiny, to\r\nhelp them build a future of freedom and justice and a\r\nlife in peace with their neighbours.\r\nThe United Nations should play a key role in\r\nsetting the benchmarks and guiding the political\r\nprocess towards the early restoration of Iraq’s\r\nsovereignty and the transfer of power to an Iraqi\r\ngovernment. A carefully considered timeframe must be\r\ndrawn up. We must also make sure that the tasks that\r\nwe decide for the United Nations in Iraq are realistic\r\nand achievable.\r\nTerrorism is a dark force, which targets the very\r\nvalues and norms upon which the United Nations\r\nCharter is based. An overwhelming majority of\r\nMember States have joined forces to fight it, and we\r\nhave taken some important steps together. We need to\r\nstrengthen the role of the United Nations in multilateral\r\ndisarmament, arms control and non-proliferation. We\r\nneed to agree on strong and effective regimes that can\r\nprovide reliable protection against weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nA week ago, world leaders and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral sat down in New York at the invitation of\r\nNorway to discuss ways to fight terrorism and the roots\r\nof evil. They voiced their dedication to the fight\r\nagainst terrorism, and their determination to place\r\nhumanity at the centre of that fight.\r\nWe want a United Nations that reaches out and\r\nresponds to the concerns of all Member States. It must\r\nreach out and respond to the concerns of all\r\nindividuals, to the needs of men and women alike. We\r\nneed a world of equal opportunities, where all the\r\nworld’s human resources — and not only half of\r\nthem — are fully put to use. We have a vision of a\r\nhumane world where people can live in security and\r\ndignity, free from poverty and despair. To live up to the\r\nideals enshrined in the Charter, the United Nations\r\nmust continue to give priority to human rights and\r\nfundamental aspects of governance.\r\nA culture of impunity for mass atrocities is\r\nincompatible with human dignity and undermines long-\r\nterm security. The establishment of the International\r\nCriminal Court is a historic turning point.\r\nFighting terrorism, strengthening human security,\r\nworking for development and preventing conflict are\r\nchallenges that are closely related. In the Millennium\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nDevelopment Goals, we have pledged to halve the\r\nproportion of people living in extreme poverty and to\r\nreduce child mortality by two-thirds. We have pledged\r\nto halve the proportion of people without access to safe\r\ndrinking water and basic sanitation.\r\nNorway currently holds the chairmanship of the\r\nCommission on Sustainable Development, and we are\r\ncommitted to achieving real progress. It is crucial that\r\ndeveloping and developed countries and the private\r\nsector all contribute. Development must be built on a\r\nglobal partnership and on shared responsibilities.\r\nNorway remains committed to the Doha Development\r\nAgenda. We are confident that strengthening and\r\nmaking full use of this multilateral framework is the\r\nway to go. We will work hard to get the negotiations\r\nback on track.\r\nMore often than not, the United Nations only\r\nbecomes engaged in earnest after armed conflict has\r\nbroken out. The reasons are many, but they are no\r\nexcuse for the loss of lives, the human misery and the\r\nsetbacks in development that are too often the high\r\nprice of collective inaction. Too often the main legacy\r\nof a civil war is another civil war. Yet there are many\r\nthings we can do to prevent this from happening.\r\nWe can act to prevent economic conflict drivers\r\nsuch as diamonds and other natural resources, from\r\nfuelling and prolonging conflicts, and we can act to\r\ncurb the illegal trade in small arms. By fighting\r\npoverty and promoting peace and development, we are\r\nmaking the soundest investment possible in Africa. We\r\nwill assist the African Union and the New Partnership\r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) in their endeavours\r\ntowards economic and social development and political\r\nstability in Africa.\r\nNorway will continue working for peace and\r\nstability in the Horn of Africa. The peace process\r\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea is entering a crucial\r\nphase. We urge both parties to stand by their\r\ncommitments and not hesitate now that they stand at\r\nthe threshold of lasting peace.\r\nIn the Sudan, important progress has just been\r\nmade. We urge the parties to step up their efforts and\r\nreach a final settlement.\r\nOver the last few years, the United Nations has\r\nmade considerable progress in peacekeeping. The\r\nfoundations for a new approach have been laid.\r\nNotable results have been achieved in Kosovo, Sierra\r\nLeone and Timor-Leste, as well as in reinforcing the\r\ncapabilities of the Department of Peacekeeping\r\nOperations and strengthening the United Nations\r\nStandby Arrangement System.\r\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in\r\nAfghanistan is facing a particularly challenging task.\r\nTwo years on, much has been achieved, but the\r\nsituation is still volatile. The safe and secure\r\nenvironment needed for economic growth and full\r\nimplementation of the Bonn Agreement is not in place.\r\nMany people are suffering from food shortages, and are\r\nin need of assistance. Elections are due next year.\r\nWomen are not yet properly empowered. Unless we can\r\nassure nation-wide security, the nation-building process\r\nin Afghanistan will be at risk. A sustained international\r\npresence will be necessary for the foreseeable future.\r\nWith NATO in command of the International\r\nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF), Norway as a NATO\r\nmember has an additional stake in the building of a\r\npeaceful and prosperous future for the people of\r\nAfghanistan. We have decided to make Afghanistan\r\none of our partner countries in development\r\ncooperation.\r\nIn Sri Lanka the peace process has reached a\r\ndecisive juncture. We are hopeful that the parties will\r\nsoon be able to embark on negotiations towards an\r\ninterim administration for the North-East Province. It\r\nis vital that the parties reach agreement and resume\r\ndirect peace negotiations within the timeframe\r\nenvisaged.\r\nDevelopment of the economic infrastructure is\r\nequally important for all in Sri Lanka. In parallel with\r\ndealing with the political process, the parties should\r\ntake care to proceed with the important task of\r\nreconstruction and development.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nNorway remains firmly committed to the role of\r\nfacilitator of the peace process between the\r\nGovernment of Sri Lanka and the LTTE. We call on the\r\ninternational community to engage in the efforts for\r\nreconstruction and rehabilitation in Sri Lanka.\r\nIn Myanmar the Government has recently stated\r\nits intention to invite the democratic opposition and the\r\nethnic minorities to take part in the building of a\r\nnational consensus. A good way to start would be to\r\nrelease Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and without\r\nconditions and thereby demonstrate the Government’s\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nsincere intentions. This might mean the beginning of a\r\nnew political era in Myanmar. Norway stands ready to\r\nsupport efforts to make democratization an irreversible\r\nprocess. We strongly support the role of the United\r\nNations and believe that the active involvement of\r\ncountries in the region will be vital to reaching a\r\nsolution.\r\nThe year 2003 has been a tragic one for Israelis\r\nand Palestinians. Their acceptance of the road map for\r\npeace boded well, but again violence and not politics is\r\ndetermining the course of development. A political\r\nsolution is needed, building on a parallel process where\r\nIsrael takes significant steps to end the occupation, and\r\nwhere the Palestinian Authority takes determined steps\r\nto fight terror. The ultimate goal, in which we will not\r\nlose faith, is that of two States — Israel and\r\nPalestine — living side by side in peace and security.\r\nNorway urges Israel to do its utmost to ease the\r\nliving conditions of the Palestinians. In our capacity as\r\nchairman of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for\r\nassistance to the Palestinian people, Norway remains\r\ncommitted to rebuilding the Palestinian areas.\r\nNorway also believes that the parties should avail\r\nthemselves of the assistance of the international\r\ncommunity and individual countries through\r\nappropriate monitoring mechanisms.\r\nThe past year has been a trying one for the United\r\nNations. Multilateralism has come under pressure from\r\nthose who continue to question the primacy of the\r\nUnited Nations and therefore look elsewhere for\r\nsolutions.\r\nThe answer to this challenge is to make the\r\nUnited Nations more effective and thus more relevant\r\nin dealing with issues at the top of the international\r\nagenda. By increasing the relevance of the United\r\nNations we can increase its authority and legitimacy.\r\nNorway shares the Secretary-General’s view that\r\nMember States need to take a hard look at today’s\r\nUnited Nations institutions and ask whether they are\r\nadequate for the tasks we have before us.\r\nThe time has come to advance the issue of reform\r\nof the Security Council. It is also time to agree on a\r\nmore relevant agenda for the General Assembly, the\r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Commission on\r\nHuman Rights. Norway puts emphasis on reforming the\r\nwork of the First Committee. We therefore welcome\r\nthe Secretary-General’s decision to appoint a high-level\r\npanel to recommend concrete ways in which to\r\nstrengthen the functioning of the major bodies of the\r\nUnited Nations and the relationships between them.\r\nNorway, together with the Nordic countries, has a long-\r\nstanding commitment to reform. We stand ready to\r\nassist in bringing the initiatives of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to fruition.\r\nThe aims and ideals of the United Nations are as\r\nrelevant as ever — to maintain peace and security, to\r\nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, to establish\r\nconditions for justice and the international rule of law\r\nand to promote economic and social development.\r\nThe world has changed since 1945, but the United\r\nNations has not changed with it. I urge Member States\r\nto come together with a renewed sense of unity and\r\npurpose, so that we can change our Organization in the\r\ncollective spirit that lies at the core of the Charter.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Didier Opertti, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay and former President of\r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Opertti (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish):\r\nUruguay believes in the United Nations, has faith in the\r\nUnited Nations, will support the Organization and will\r\ncontinue to contribute to it, as it has been doing since it\r\nbecame one of its founding Members. It is comforting\r\nto note that, at this time of crisis for the Organization,\r\nvirtually all the participants in this debate have\r\nexpressed this same sentiment.\r\nSome six decades ago, the United Nations was\r\ncreated to promote and regulate multilateral\r\ncooperation, by which the international community\r\nagreed to address and resolve common problems. The\r\nstructure of the Organization, the functioning of its\r\norgans, and the rights and obligations of its Members,\r\nas formulated in the San Francisco Charter, all\r\nreflected the international political reality of that time.\r\nBut, over the course of more than half a century,\r\nthere have been profound changes in the structure of\r\ninternational society. Its actors have multiplied and\r\nbecome more diverse and there have been new and\r\nmore dangerous manifestations of violence. New\r\nthreats to peace that were not foreseen by the drafters\r\nof the Charter occur with increasing frequency. At the\r\nsame time, there has been an intensification of certain\r\ngrowing trends that seriously affect the well-being of\r\nhumanity, such as the degradation of the environment,\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nthe depletion of natural resources, epidemics and the\r\ncontrast between consumer societies and societies that\r\nlive in extreme poverty.\r\nIn recent years, and in particular during this\r\ngeneral debate, special emphasis has been placed on\r\nthe need to reform and revitalize the United Nations in\r\norder to adapt it to current realities. Uruguay shares\r\nthis position, not only because it considers that this\r\nOrganization has not been completely effective in its\r\nhandling of some recent crises, but because it\r\nunderstands that the scale of the changes in the world\r\ntoday justifies the search for ways of adapting the\r\ninstitution.\r\nAlthough it is true that the system of collective\r\nsecurity established by the San Francisco Charter has\r\nnot always been able to respond to crises effectively, in\r\nnumerous cases multilateral action by the United\r\nNations has succeeded in restoring peace in many\r\nregions and countries, contributed to the consolidation\r\nof democracy, and accelerated the reconstruction of\r\naffected countries. There are many more cases in which\r\nthe Organization, through its various organs, has\r\nexercised positive and decisive control over crises and\r\nconflicts, thus preventing the situation from becoming\r\nworse and ensuring a peaceful solution.\r\nThe process of reform, which is indispensable\r\nand cannot be delayed, should in our view be based on\r\nthe following premises.\r\nThe first is to preserve intact the purposes and\r\nprinciples of the Organization, as enshrined in the\r\nCharter of San Francisco. After all, if we all gather\r\nhere every year as the United Nations, it is because our\r\nnations are united around the values and ideals\r\nenshrined in the Charter and shared by all mankind,\r\nwhose permanent and universal validity transcends the\r\nvicissitudes and accidents of history.\r\nThe second premise is that the reform process\r\nshould be aimed principally at strengthening\r\nmultilateral action, because never before has the need\r\nto cooperate and act together to deal with international\r\nproblems been so great. Common global responses are\r\nneeded to the proliferation and diversification of\r\ninternational actors; the fact that the world is getting\r\nsmaller and more and more interdependent, due to the\r\nincrease in trade and the extraordinary development of\r\ninformation and communication technologies; and\r\nabove all the globalization of threats to peace, security\r\nand the well-being of our peoples. To use the words\r\nemployed by the Secretary-General in this Assembly\r\ntwo weeks ago, Uruguay believes in “collective\r\nanswers to our common problems and challenges”\r\n(A/58/PV.7).\r\nTwo years ago, the international community,\r\nthrough the United Nations organs, offered a fine\r\nexample of solidarity by taking effective multilateral\r\naction in reaction to international terrorism, which\r\nthreatens Governments, peoples, ideologies, religions\r\nand above all human reason, imbued with such\r\nelementary values as tolerance, compassion, solidarity\r\nand respect for human rights.\r\nThe attack on the headquarters of the United\r\nNations in Baghdad — for which we wish again to\r\nexpress our most sincere condolences to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral — is but another example of the barbarity and\r\nfanaticism that we can successfully fight only if we\r\nwork together. With this attack, terrorism has given us\r\na raw example of its destructive universality. The\r\ndeaths of Special Representative Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello and of other colleagues is emblematic of the\r\ntragedy suffered.\r\nJust as in the fight against poverty, terrorism\r\ncannot be defeated as a conventional enemy would be\r\nwith a victorious battle. The eradication of terrorism is\r\nan ongoing objective whose achievement requires time,\r\npatience and perseverance. Only through a joint\r\napproach and multilateral action directed above all at\r\nthe roots of terrorism — not only at its atrocious\r\nmanifestations — will it be possible to reduce and\r\nhopefully to eliminate this perverse and ubiquitous\r\nenemy and at the very least ensure its total rejection.\r\nUruguay, which is party to most international\r\nanti-terrorism instruments, attaches priority to the\r\nconclusion of a general convention against\r\ninternational terrorism. In this respect, we wish to\r\nexpress our satisfaction to the Secretary-General for\r\nhaving chosen transnational organized crime and\r\nterrorism as an item in the signing and accession\r\nceremony for treaties promoted by the Organization on\r\nthe occasion of this general debate.\r\nThe third premise to which my country subscribes\r\nis that we must not forget that the United Nations has\r\nfor years now been engaged in a process of self-\r\ncriticism and self-reform based on the idea that\r\nstrengthening an institution means strengthening its\r\norgans. Reforms are being implemented in three of the\r\nmain organs of the Organization. The modalities of\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\neach one of the respective processes differ. In the\r\nSecurity Council, we are pursuing reform of its\r\nmembership to make it more representative and to\r\nstrengthen its democratic character. In the General\r\nAssembly, we are pursuing its revitalization so that its\r\ndecisions can regain the authority they had in the past.\r\nIn the Secretariat, the purpose of change is to enhance\r\nits effectiveness, an objective towards which the\r\nSecretary-General is working strenuously. These three\r\nprocesses are closely linked to each other but, despite\r\nthis close link, we believe that they must continue to be\r\npursued, as is now being done, separately, each one in\r\nits respective forum.\r\nFor Uruguay, one of the most important aspects\r\nof these reforms is the strengthening of the General\r\nAssembly, over which you, Sir, are presiding with such\r\ndignity and whose decisions are the most genuine\r\nmanifestations of the will of the international\r\ncommunity. Recent reforms are aimed at making this\r\norgan more effective, but more profound changes are\r\nrequired in order to restore the authority which the\r\nCharter grants it and which the Assembly has exerted\r\nin the past. We believe that there is still a great deal of\r\nroom for reform. Obsolete structures and procedures\r\nremain. We also need to re-examine and evaluate the\r\norganization, conduct and outcome of the annual\r\nsession that brings us all here together every year,\r\nincluding the idea of concentrating the negotiation of\r\ndozens of resolutions into a few weeks. Uruguay will\r\nsupport far-reaching measures to revitalize the\r\nAssembly. A better relationship between the different\r\norgans is no doubt another of the necessary areas for\r\nreform.\r\nThe fourth and final premise is that the efforts to\r\nreform our institutions must be complemented by\r\nequally vigorous efforts to change our own conduct as\r\nMembers of the United Nations. When we agreed to\r\nbecome Members of this Organization, we freely\r\nagreed to fulfil in good faith the international\r\nobligations arising from the numerous treaties,\r\nconventions and other instruments that have resulted\r\nfrom the comprehensive legislative work accomplished\r\nby this Assembly, United Nations agencies and other\r\ninternational organizations and conferences.\r\nHowever, the provisions of many of these\r\ninstruments are not being implemented. At times, in a\r\nmisguided defence of sovereignty, common\r\nexpectations are thwarted in order to satisfy national\r\ninterests that frequently are not of decisive importance.\r\nProtection of the environment and the law of the sea\r\nare good, but not the only examples of areas in which a\r\nsharp contrast can be seen between the extensive\r\nlegislation that exists and the degree of\r\nimplementation. Consequently, year after year, the\r\ncompetent international agencies and organizations and\r\nscientific authorities report the ongoing deterioration of\r\nthe general environment, the abusive exploitation of\r\nnatural resources, pollution of the seas and reduction or\r\nextinction of marine species.\r\nThe question of the fulfilment of obligations\r\nassumed is the weak link in the chain of\r\nmultilateralism. We must seek ways of ensuring respect\r\nfor international obligations. Over the long term, the\r\nsatisfaction of common interests is the best way of\r\nsatisfying the national interest.\r\nWithout prejudice to this profession of faith in the\r\nUnited Nations, Uruguay, a country of Latin America,\r\nis actively participating in the Organization of\r\nAmerican States and in the inter-American system in\r\ngeneral. Uruguay is also fully committed to regional\r\nintegration processes, in particular to the Common\r\nMarket of the South. We see in these mechanisms a\r\npromising avenue to help overcome the difficulties that\r\nresult from our status as a developing country emerging\r\nfrom the most serious economic crisis of its history and\r\ntrying to overcome the obstacles preventing it from\r\nachieving insertion into the global economy, such as,\r\nfor example, the huge subsidies that the industrialized\r\ncountries grant to their agricultural producers.\r\nIn this connection, finally, we cannot but mention\r\nthe recent ministerial conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization, held in Cancún, whose lack of progress,\r\nin our opinion, is a negative signal to a world that is\r\ndemanding fairer and more balanced rules, especially\r\nfor countries such as Uruguay, whose economies rely\r\nprimarily on the production of agricultural goods. We\r\nare hopeful that renewed impetus in the negotiations\r\nwill permit us to achieve positive results in the coming\r\nweeks and months in Geneva, to the benefit of the less\r\ndeveloped countries and the very future of international\r\ntrade.\r\nI close my statement conveying my country’s\r\nsatisfaction and pride in seeing you, Sir, the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, a friendly country of\r\nour region, presiding over this Assembly. I wish you\r\nevery success in your work.\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His Royal\r\nHighness Prince Mohamed Bolkiah, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nPrince Mohamed Bolkiah (Brunei Darussalam):\r\nMy congratulations go to you, Sir, and to the people of\r\nSaint Lucia on your election, together with my thanks\r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Kavan, for his work over the\r\npast year. You have our full support and best wishes in\r\nall your efforts to promote the interests of the members\r\nof this Assembly.\r\nMay I couple these greetings with my great\r\nappreciation to our Secretary-General and his staff. We\r\nare very grateful indeed for their dedication and service\r\nduring one of the most difficult years in United Nations\r\nhistory.\r\nIn particular, I wish to add once more the deepest\r\nsympathy of the Government and people of Brunei\r\nDarussalam to the families of Sergio Vieira de Mello\r\nand of all who lost loved ones, colleagues and friends\r\nin the attack on the United Nations headquarters in\r\nBaghdad. His Excellency and his staff were our public\r\nservants, our representatives and our people. The attack\r\non them was an attack on us all. As such, we condemn\r\nit and all other acts of terrorism.\r\nWhen Brunei Darussalam had the honour of\r\nbecoming a Member of this Organization, we\r\ncommitted ourselves to two principles. The first was\r\nnationhood and all that this implies in terms of the rule\r\nof international law and the procedures that govern the\r\naffairs of this Assembly. The second was multilateral\r\ndecision-making and, in turn, all that this also\r\nimplies — respect for fellow members, sensitivity to\r\ntheir deep concerns and the need for dialogue and\r\nconsultation as equal partners in the conduct of\r\ninternational affairs, no matter how long and how\r\nfrustrating the process involved may be.\r\nWe continue to maintain our belief in these\r\nprinciples in spite of many disappointments in the past\r\nyear, both here in the United Nations and earlier this\r\nmonth at the World Trade Organization. We feel that\r\nthey are the only basis upon which international affairs\r\ncan be conducted fairly. They apply to all the great\r\npolitical and economic organizations of which we are\r\nmembers and we especially look to the United Nations\r\nto uphold them.\r\nBy this token, the United Nations is whatever we\r\nourselves make it. We form the largest coalition in\r\nhistory and we share responsibility for its successes\r\nand its failures. Among those is our failure to bring in\r\nthe changes that are necessary if we are to evolve with\r\nthe times in which we live.\r\nSince 1992, this Assembly has been debating\r\nreform. It has the support of a large majority here,\r\nincluding all members of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe results of our failure to build on this support can\r\nnow be clearly seen. Our Security Council has been\r\ngravely divided and the past year has left a legacy of\r\nbitterness. The consequences for the ordinary people\r\nwe represent — the people of developing nations year\r\nafter year, the people of Iraq for the past 10 years or\r\nmore, and the citizens of Palestine for over half a\r\ncentury — have been ever more disastrous.\r\nIn all this time, Members have been well aware\r\nthat decision-making at the United Nations needs to be\r\nmore inclusive and genuinely multilateral. On many\r\noccasions, they have expressed the desire that the\r\nOrganization reflect today’s world rather than the\r\nworld of half a century ago. They wish to feel truly part\r\nof the decisions it makes.\r\nAs it operates now, however, many observers feel\r\nthat the actual Members of this Organization are too\r\nweak to act effectively in solving the great affairs of\r\nthe day. It is claimed that international affairs are now\r\nbeyond the control of individual nations. They are\r\nglobal — global finance; global economics; global\r\ndevelopment; global poverty; global crime; and, of\r\ncourse, global terrorism. Consequently, some voices\r\ndeclare that an Assembly of individual nations, many\r\nof them small and still developing, has no power to\r\naddress such matters.\r\nThat is a depressing scenario and, of course, none\r\nof us here really wants to believe it, but it does have\r\none merit. It forces us to examine what the United\r\nNations can actually do most effectively and what it\r\ncan realistically achieve. The reply from too many of\r\nour people today would be, we fear: not much. This\r\npresents a powerful case for reform.\r\nI therefore feel that we must frankly acknowledge\r\nour part in the feelings of hopelessness and frustration\r\nthat are being voiced by ordinary people and indeed by\r\nmany Governments. At present, restoring belief in the\r\nUnited Nations ability to act on their behalf may be our\r\nmost important immediate task. On the one hand, the\r\ngreat world institutions are technically multilateral.\r\nThey are run by the Governments of the world. Yet, in\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nfact, many of these Governments feel excluded from\r\nthe most important decisions. Many interested parties\r\nfeel that they are also on the outside.\r\nMultilateralism, in other words, appears to have\r\nits limits. Beyond them, it seems, the stronger nations\r\ntake over. This basic division, we hope, can be brought\r\nto an end. That is why we were so pleased to hear our\r\nSecretary-General emphasize the need for reform in his\r\naddress last week. We congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the structural reforms he has overseen. We\r\nalso thank him for the many times he has kept us in\r\ntouch with his thinking and that of his staff and we\r\nthank him for the hopes he has continued to express\r\nabout the future of our world Organization.\r\nWe still share his optimism. Nevertheless, that\r\nfeeling can be maintained only if agreement on reform\r\nof the whole United Nations system is a real\r\npossibility. We accept that the task of bringing about\r\nthis kind of overall change is extremely hard. The\r\nreports of your own Working Group, Mr. President,\r\nshow a difficult pattern emerging over the past 10\r\nyears. There are more and more proposals and basic\r\napproaches continually diverge. Even though we\r\nlargely share the same objectives, we remain divided\r\non the means to achieve them.\r\nThe divisions we have seen this year, however,\r\nsuggest that we cannot keep postponing change. They\r\noffer a test of whether the United Nations is indeed\r\ncapable of evolving. That test must be passed, so we\r\ncontinue to support work on Security Council reform\r\nand offer our strong encouragement to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the proposals he outlined last week.\r\nIn the face of today’s problems, the United\r\nNations must continue to offer powerful reasons for\r\noptimism about the future. We believe that this calls for\r\na determined and united effort to address the root\r\ncauses of the anger of all who feel unjustly treated. To\r\ndo this, the United Nations as a whole must be a\r\ngenuine partnership between nations. It must stand for\r\nshared idealism and a shared sense of human justice.\r\nThat is what no other body can do.\r\nThat is what the work of Sergio Vieira de Mello\r\nand his colleagues was dedicated to. In their memory,\r\nand in that of all who have given their lives to this\r\nOrganization, we all need to do a lot better at working\r\ntogether than we have over the past year.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency The Honourable Godfrey Smith, Attorney-\r\nGeneral and Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nCooperation of Belize.\r\nMr. Smith (Belize): My delegation celebrates the\r\nwisdom of the United Nations in choosing one of our\r\ndistinguished Caribbean statesmen, Mr. Julian Hunte,\r\nto preside over this fifty-eighth session of the General\r\nAssembly. I assure you, Sir, that the energy and\r\nindustry that you will bring to our work will produce\r\nvery meaningful results in this very important session.\r\nWe continue to be fortunate to have the guidance\r\nand strength of our Secretary-General, whose skill and\r\ncompassion are especially needed today. His words last\r\nTuesday echoed strong and true, and we should all take\r\nheed.\r\nAnd speaking of all, we need to respect the\r\nprinciple of universality of our Organization. The time\r\nhas come to admit Taiwan to membership of the United\r\nNations. Taiwan has proven itself to be an exemplary\r\nmember of the international community with a deep\r\nsense of solidarity with small and poor nations.\r\nBelize’s Prime Minister has said:\r\n“When we turn our attention to the\r\ninternational stage there is greater cause for\r\nanxiety. Let us ask ourselves: After all the\r\ndevelopments in building the international system\r\nand crystallizing international law from 1945 to\r\nthe present, which of the following fundamental\r\nprinciples are respected in practice or indeed safe\r\nin theory: the peaceful settlement of disputes; the\r\nright to self-determination, sovereignty and\r\nterritorial integrity; non-interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of States; the right of peoples to\r\nhave the social and political system of their\r\nchoice; respect for social, economic and political\r\nhuman rights; not to use force or the threat of\r\nforce to settle disputes; respect for the\r\ninternational rule of law; abiding by the Charter\r\nof the United Nations; and working towards a\r\nworld governance based on multilateralism and\r\nthe rule of reason, rather than of force?\r\n“Which of those is safe? Indeed, in the\r\ninternational arena … we do seem to be in free\r\nfall towards barbarism”.\r\nBarbarism may not be new, but there does seem\r\nto be a greater tolerance for it and we do seem to be\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nmore powerless to contain it. In a world riddled with\r\nfear and dominated by terrorism, including State\r\nterrorism, we need to concentrate on what needs to be\r\ndone to save our humanity.\r\nMr. Rakhmonov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, took\r\nthe Chair.\r\nAs we contemplate the international arena, with\r\nmultilateralism under threat and the development of\r\npeoples blocked by the practices of the rich and\r\npowerful, we can take comfort in one thing — that,\r\nyes, in the end ideas are more powerful than arms. And\r\nour ideas — we the United Nations of the world — are\r\nclearly and powerfully set out in our Charter. Yes, the\r\nCharter needs reform; we need urgently to democratize\r\nour practice. Small States make up the majority of our\r\nmembership and elementary democracy demands that\r\nwe have a greater say than our Charter presently allows\r\nus, but the basic principles of the Charter remain valid.\r\nThe fundamentals are in place.\r\nArticle 1 of the Charter states the fundamental\r\npurpose of the United Nations: To maintain\r\ninternational peace and security, and to that end to take\r\neffective collective measures for the prevention and\r\nremoval of threats to the peace, and for the suppression\r\nof acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace.\r\nArticle 24 of the Charter confers on the Security\r\nCouncil primary responsibility for the maintenance of\r\ninternational peace and security. Under Article 42,\r\nshould the Security Council consider that measures\r\nshort of the use of force would be inadequate or have\r\nproved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air,\r\nsea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or\r\nrestore international peace and security. Such action\r\nmust, of course, be agreed collective action, not\r\nunilateral action.\r\nI ask members of the Assembly: Is there any part\r\nof that we do not understand? It seems perfectly simple\r\nand clear to us small States, which depend on the\r\nUnited Nations Charter and on respect for international\r\nprinciples and international law for our very existence.\r\nWe are confronted with the question: Are we as an\r\nOrganization irrelevant? And I say: only if we make\r\nourselves irrelevant. And we do that only if we are\r\ndetermined to self-destruct.\r\nWe can call here for many lofty objectives, as\r\ncontained in our Millennium Development Goals. We\r\ncan pronounce on the many injustices facing so many\r\npeoples and countries in the present world\r\ndispensation, but all of that would be futile if our very\r\nUnited Nations should cease to be effective or become\r\nirrelevant. That is why I have restricted my statement\r\nto one plea to nations large and small, powerful or\r\nweak: Keep the United Nations alive, respect its\r\nCharter, abide by agreed international principles and\r\ninternational law. That is all we ask, nothing more.\r\nAbove all, let us not give up what it has cost us so\r\nmuch time and effort, so much blood, to bring to a\r\nmodest but important stage — our multilateral system.\r\nAll civilized nations would surely agree to this\r\nplea rather than plunge the world into barbarism.\r\nMultilateralism or chaos. Long Live the United\r\nNations!\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Surakiart\r\nSathirathai, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\r\nKingdom of Thailand.\r\nMr Sathirathai (Thailand): At the outset, I\r\nwould like to join the international community in\r\npaying tribute to the late Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello,\r\nall United Nations personnel who lost their lives and\r\nthose wounded by the terrorist attack on the United\r\nNations headquarters in Baghdad. We strongly\r\ncondemn that cowardly terrorist attack and reaffirm our\r\ncommitment to supporting the United Nations in\r\npaving the way for the stability, security and\r\nsovereignty of Iraq.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of\r\nThailand, I wish to extend my sincere congratulations\r\nto Mr. Julian Hunte of Saint Lucia upon his election to\r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\r\neighth session. I am confident that, under his wise and\r\nexemplary leadership, this session, held at such a\r\ndifficult time, will lead to a fruitful conclusion. I also\r\nwish to take this opportunity to commend his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, whose tireless efforts have\r\nsteered the United Nations along a constructive path\r\nduring a year of difficult challenges.\r\nThis session meets at a most critical juncture or,\r\nas the Secretary-General put it in his address: “We have\r\ncome to a fork in the road” (A/58/PV.7). This road was\r\nmeant to build a multilateral system to ensure a better\r\nworld for the human race. It is at this critical juncture\r\nthat the threats and challenges to multilateralism of the\r\npast 12 months have underscored, more than ever, that\r\nin order to collectively confront these threats and\r\nchallenges to global peace, security and prosperity, the\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nworld cannot do without multilateralism. But, as\r\nechoed by many from this rostrum, the big question is:\r\nhow?\r\nAs the foremost multilateral institution, the\r\nUnited Nations needs to carry out its mission in the\r\ncontext of these realities. The Secretary-General has\r\nexpounded his far-sighted initiative for the proposed\r\nreforms of the institutions and the establishment of a\r\nhigh-level panel of eminent personalities. Thailand\r\nlends its support to the Secretary-General’s noble\r\nendeavour and hopes that, during the next session, he\r\nwill come up with a proposal that will take us on the\r\nright path.\r\nMany different views, agreements and\r\ndisagreements have been expressed in this Hall in this\r\ngeneral debate. This illustrates that the international\r\ncommunity must learn to live with and be tolerant of\r\ndifferences. We may differ in culture, religion and\r\nvalues, but our differences and diversities must not\r\nbecome the sources of hostility. They must be a source\r\nof our combined strength to enhance partnership and\r\nmultilateralism. We believe that the promotion of true\r\npartnership and human security will help the United\r\nNations mission in fulfilling its noble goals.\r\nFrom Timor-Leste to Sierra Leone and Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, the international community can be\r\nproud of forging partnership in peacekeeping\r\noperations under the framework of the United Nations.\r\nThailand is proud to be one of the 89 countries\r\nparticipating in United Nations peacekeeping\r\noperations and wishes to reiterate its commitment to\r\ncontinuing this partnership wherever and whenever\r\nneeded through its participation in the United Nations\r\nstandby arrangements system. For its part, Thailand\r\nremains firmly committed to supporting United Nations\r\nreconstruction and peace-building efforts, as we have\r\ndone in the past in Timor-Leste and Afghanistan.\r\nThailand has already contributed $250,000 to Iraq\r\nthrough the International Committee of the Red Cross\r\nand is committed to providing another $500,000 for\r\ndried halal food. Military construction engineers and\r\nmedical personnel are also being dispatched to Iraq to\r\nprovide further humanitarian assistance. We hope that\r\npeace can eventually reign in the region.\r\nNo one deserves peace, stability and a prosperous\r\nfuture more than the peoples of the Middle East. Far\r\ntoo long have the people of that region suffered from\r\nviolence, acts of terror and despair. We call upon the\r\ninternational community to come together in\r\naddressing this problem. All sides must seize the\r\nopportunity to embark on the road towards a just and\r\ncomprehensive peace so that the people of Israel and\r\nthe people of Palestine can at last live in peace,\r\nsecurity and harmony.\r\nTerrorism spares no one, strong or weak, rich or\r\npoor. To succeed against terrorism, there is no other\r\nway but to be united. The Government of Thailand has\r\nworked very closely with the international community\r\nto rid the world of this scourge. Domestic legislation\r\nhas been amended in order to enable Thailand to cope\r\nwith terrorist activities and to suppress the financing of\r\nterrorism more effectively. We take no second chances\r\nin our fight against international terrorism.\r\nAs freedom from fear and freedom from want are\r\nthe two major components of human security, it is clear\r\nthat human security cannot be achieved simply because\r\na country wants to do it all alone. Rather, human\r\nsecurity is achieved because all countries decide to do\r\nit all together. It is achieved because countries are\r\nwilling to forge a partnership out of their differences to\r\nbuild strength for human security.\r\nThat is why Thailand considers its membership of\r\nthe Human Security Network an important partnership\r\nstrength, complementary to the core values of the\r\nUnited Nations for the promotion of peace and security,\r\neconomic and social development, human rights,\r\nhumanitarian affairs and international law. Only two\r\nweeks ago, Thailand was proud and honoured to have\r\nhosted the Fifth Meeting of States Parties to the\r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,\r\nProduction and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and\r\non Their Destruction. It was the first time this Meeting\r\nhas come to Asia, where land mines are a threat to the\r\nsecurity of hundreds of millions of people. Throughout\r\nour presidency of the Convention until the first review\r\nconference in November 2004, Thailand will do its\r\nutmost to ensure much further achievements and\r\nconsiderable progress in the core objectives of the\r\nConvention: mine clearance, victim assistance,\r\nstockpile destruction and universal acceptance of the\r\nConvention.\r\nAcross the continent, as one of only three Asian\r\npartners for cooperation with the Organization for\r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, Thailand seeks to\r\nbuild bridges between Asia, especially the Association\r\nof Southeast Asian Nations, and Europe. We believe\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nthat not despite our differences in cultural and social\r\nvalues, but because of those differences, Asia and\r\nEurope will learn the art of living together, creating a\r\nworld of human security.\r\nNarcotic drugs and pandemics transcend all\r\nborders and become as much of a threat to human\r\nsecurity as terrorism. Like terrorism, decisive and\r\nresolute partnership actions at all levels are required to\r\ntackle these global problems to achieve sustainable\r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Thai Government has declared war against\r\nnarcotic drugs since taking office in February 2001.\r\nThis year, we made it the peak of our campaign. Our\r\nbattle against the scourge of drug production and\r\ntrafficking, especially methamphetamines, must be all\r\nbut comprehensive. Within the permit of the law, we\r\nhave mounted an integrated strategic campaign,\r\nincorporating prevention, treatment and rehabilitation,\r\nand suppression. We hope to be able to declare a total\r\nvictory by the end of the year.\r\nWe have forged a more effective partnership with\r\nour neighbours and beyond to overcome this global\r\nscourge once and for all. This past June, Thailand\r\nhosted a five-nation meeting comprising Thailand,\r\nChina, India, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nand Myanmar to discuss combating transnational\r\ncrimes, including the issue of drug trafficking.\r\nFurthermore, Thailand is also forging partnership at the\r\nglobal level by working hand in hand with the United\r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime as a partner with\r\nshared responsibility to counter drugs and crime in the\r\nglobal context.\r\nJust as drugs tear at the social fabric of societies,\r\ndiseases such as HIV/AIDS cripple human resources\r\nacross the globe. Thailand commends the convening of\r\nthe high-level plenary on HIV/AIDS on 22 September.\r\nWe support the ongoing efforts undertaken within the\r\nframework of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. We also remain steadfast in\r\nour partnerships with neighbouring countries,\r\nparticularly the Greater Mekong subregion, as well as\r\nwith related United Nations agencies, to help tackle the\r\nglobal challenge posed by HIV/AIDS. As host of the\r\nFifteenth International AIDS Conference in July 2004,\r\nwe look forward to high-level representation of the\r\nworld community to share the experiences, as well as\r\nto forging strong partnerships and cooperation to build\r\na united global front to deal with this pandemic.\r\nWith regard to Severe Acute Respiratory\r\nSyndrome (SARS) — the disease that crippled many\r\ncountries and affected the tourist industry so badly\r\nthroughout the world this year — we found that only\r\nthe prompt response and commitment of ASEAN and\r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)\r\npartnership enabled us to keep the pandemic under\r\ncontrol and quell the panic and fear, which were worse\r\nthan the disease itself.\r\nThe non-traditional security threats of HIV/AIDS,\r\nSARS and narcotic drugs — “soft threats”, in the\r\nwords of the Secretary-General — demonstrate once\r\nagain that no matter what differences each country or\r\nregion may have, international cooperation and\r\npartnership are crucial in order to combat both\r\ntraditional and non-traditional challenges to human\r\nsecurity.\r\nGuided by the principle of deriving partnership\r\nstrength from diversity, Thailand has embarked on\r\nvarious initiatives to bridge socio-economic disparities\r\nat the regional and subregional levels with a view to\r\nenhancing peace and prosperity. The Asia Cooperation\r\nDialogue (ACD), which is only in its second year of\r\nexistence but already comprises 22 Asian countries,\r\nrepresenting East, West, South, North and Central Asia,\r\nis a prime example. Within one year of its inception,\r\nthe ACD had achieved considerable progress with\r\nregard to various cooperation programmes, even in the\r\narea of financial cooperation. The second ACD\r\nMinisterial Meeting in June this year adopted the\r\nChiang Mai Declaration on Asian Bond Market\r\nDevelopment. The Asian bond market has been\r\nheralded as the new financial architecture for the\r\n“world of differences”.\r\nThailand continues to work for partnership based\r\non diversity and difference so as to promote socio-\r\neconomic development among nations. Given the\r\neconomic disparity among our immediate neighbours,\r\nthe economic cooperation strategy initiated by the\r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Thaksin Shinawatra, is the most\r\nrecent partnership aimed at narrowing the economic\r\ngap between Thailand, Cambodia, the Lao People’s\r\nDemocratic Republic and Myanmar, with a view to\r\ngenerating employment and income based on\r\ncomparative advantage and mutual benefits. It will\r\ncomplement other bilateral and regional cooperative\r\nframeworks, and serve as a building block towards\r\nadvancing ASEAN economic integration.\r\n25\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nThailand has chosen the theme, “A World of\r\nDifferences: Partnership for the Future”, for the 2003\r\nmeeting of the economic leaders of APEC, scheduled\r\nto take place in Thailand in October. The convening of\r\nthat APEC leaders’ meeting reflects the belief that,\r\ndespite the diversity and differences that exist\r\nthroughout the region, there is unlimited benefit and\r\npotential that can be tapped through effective\r\npartnership. The meeting will discuss five sub-themes:\r\na knowledge-based economy; the promotion of human\r\nsecurity; financial architecture for a world of\r\ndifferences; small and medium enterprises; and action\r\non development pledges. In addition, we will focus on\r\nthe issue of counter-terrorism with a view to promoting\r\neconomic stability in the Asia-Pacific region and\r\nbeyond. The choice of those sub-themes shows that,\r\ndespite the differences among APEC economies,\r\npartnerships on those issues can be forged for the\r\nbenefit of the region and of the world.\r\nLast year, at the fifty-seventh session, I gave a\r\ncomprehensive account of Thailand’s dual-track\r\nstrategy to attain steady economic growth with social\r\nequity. Before concluding, I would like this morning to\r\nreport to the Assembly on the success of our efforts to\r\ncreate economic and social partnership. That success is\r\nthe result of combining the diverse strengths of both\r\nthe grass-roots economy and the export-led business\r\nsector as engines of growth. We are confident that our\r\neconomy rests on a secure and firm foundation that will\r\nlead us along the path of economic growth and\r\nsustainable development.\r\nLast year, the Thai economy registered a 5.3 per\r\ncent growth in gross domestic product, which was\r\nfollowed by 6.7 percent growth in the first quarter of\r\nthis year. That is our best economic performance since\r\nthe 1997 crisis. On 31 July, Thailand paid back all of\r\nits International Monetary Fund loans in full — two\r\nyears ahead of schedule. The Government is committed\r\nto the eradication of poverty, as defined by the United\r\nNations, by the year 2009. By placing human security\r\nat the forefront of the Government’s policies, Thailand\r\nis stressing its determination to ensure for the Thai\r\npeople a society free from want and free from fear.\r\nLiving in a world of differences will entail misery\r\nif we keep forging conflict out of diversity. It will\r\nentail hardship if we keep exacerbating disagreement.\r\nIt will entail stagnation if we keep failing to make\r\nroom for compromise. It will entail human suffering if\r\nGovernments keep turning their backs on chances of\r\npartnership. And it will entail devastation if we use our\r\ndifferences as an excuse to always differ.\r\nBut we, Members of the United Nations, live in a\r\nworld of differences. It is incumbent upon all of us to\r\nensure that our world of differences has a future — a\r\nfuture that will not entail misery, hardship and human\r\nsuffering as a result of those differences. It is\r\nincumbent upon every one of us to work with United\r\nNations institutions so as to ensure that our differences\r\nare turned into a source of strength for our future.\r\nThailand is doing its part, and will continue to do so,\r\nfor such a future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Choe Su Hon,\r\nDeputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Choe Su Hon (Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text\r\nprovided by the delegation): I would like at the outset,\r\non behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea, to congratulate Mr. Julian Hunte,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Saint Lucia, on his\r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at\r\nits fifty-eighth session.\r\nI would also like to express appreciation for the\r\nefforts made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\r\nAnnan, to strengthen the functions and role of the\r\nUnited Nations, as required under current\r\ncircumstances.\r\nThe political situation today is more unstable than\r\never. We are confronted by new challenges as we try to\r\nmake this century one of peace and prosperity for\r\nhumankind. Countries have been designated, on the\r\nbasis of extreme national chauvinism and hostility, as\r\npart of an axis of evil and as targets of pre-emptive\r\nnuclear attacks. Unilateral military attacks are being\r\nopenly perpetrated against sovereign States under the\r\npretext of the war against terrorism and on the basis of\r\nsuspicions that they possess weapons of mass\r\ndestruction.\r\nThe principles of respect for sovereignty and\r\nsovereign equality are being violated, and international\r\nrelations plunged into increasingly severe\r\nconfrontation and antagonism, because of neo-\r\nimperialist practices that are based on the supremacy of\r\npower.\r\n26\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nAs we are well aware, this situation is a product\r\nof unilateralism, which is compelling countries to be\r\nsubservient to the high-handedness and unreasonable\r\ndemands of the super-Power. My delegation is of the\r\nview that the pressing common task before States\r\nMembers of the United Nations is to reject\r\nunilateralism and build a new world in which all\r\ncountries, large and small, coexist peacefully.\r\nI would like to draw the attention of the\r\nAssembly to the principled position and sincere efforts\r\nof the Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea to ensure a fair solution to the\r\nnuclear issue between the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea and the United States, which is now\r\nthe focus of attention of the international community. I\r\nbelieve that it will be a positive contribution to the\r\nwork of the current General Assembly.\r\nThe nuclear issue is, in its essence, an outcome of\r\nthe hostile policy pursued by the United States to\r\nisolate and stifle the Democratic People’s Republic of\r\nKorea politically, economically and militarily. It\r\noriginated from this deep-rooted hostility, which denies\r\nour system and refuses to co-exist with my country.\r\nMy country’s consistent position is to resolve the\r\nnuclear issue peacefully through dialogue and\r\nnegotiations. Denuclearizing the Korean peninsula is\r\nthe ultimate goal, the initiative of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the earnest aspiration\r\nof the entire Korean nation.\r\nAccordingly, at both tripartite and six-party talks\r\non the nuclear issue, my country advanced proposals\r\naimed at achieving the denuclearization of the Korean\r\npeninsula. The announcement of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea — United States Joint\r\nStatement of 11 June 1993, the adoption of the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea — United\r\nStates Agreed Framework on 21 October 1994 and the\r\nsubsequent process of their implementation have\r\nclearly testified to our peace-loving stand and its\r\njustness.\r\nThe Korean people as well as the entire world\r\nwelcomed the historic inter-Korean summit meeting in\r\nJune 2000 and its resultant adoption of the June 15\r\nNorth-South Joint Declaration. They also sincerely\r\nhoped that these developments would lead to peace and\r\nstability in the region.\r\nHowever, the welcome atmosphere and the\r\nexpectations for peace and stability, raised for a while,\r\nsuddenly disappeared, and one party has resumed acute\r\nconfrontation. My country has been singled out as part\r\nof an axis of evil and the target of pre-emptive nuclear\r\nattack. That was then adopted as a policy and put into\r\naction. In particular, following the visit by the United\r\nStates presidential envoy to the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea in October 2002, the United States\r\nreversed black and white, alleging that my country had\r\nadmitted to have a secret nuclear weapons programme.\r\nIt also proceeded to unilaterally halt the supply of\r\nheavy fuel oil from November 2002 in violation of the\r\nAgreed Framework, and eventually it nullified all the\r\nbilateral agreements.\r\nThe United States even put pressure upon my\r\ncountry to give up its nuclear programme and accept\r\nnuclear inspection with the aim of disarming the\r\ncountry, while openly attempting to overthrow the\r\nGovernment by force. The peace now maintained on\r\nthe Korean peninsula is entirely thanks to the powerful\r\ndeterrence to war, which has been built up by our\r\npolicy of independence, the songun policy. Our\r\ndeterrence policy is not intended to attack anyone, but\r\nto serve as a means of self-defence to safeguard our\r\nsovereignty in all intents and purposes.\r\nIn order to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully\r\nthrough dialogue, the hostile policy towards my\r\ncountry should be changed fundamentally. That is the\r\nkey to the solution of the nuclear issue. At the six-party\r\ntalks in Beijing in late August, my country set as a goal\r\nthe abandonment by the United States of its hostile\r\npolicy towards us in exchange for renunciation of our\r\nnuclear programme. To achieve that goal, we proposed\r\nto take all necessary measures through a package deal\r\nand to work towards the implementation of these\r\nmeasures on a step-by-step basis, following the\r\nprinciple of simultaneous action.\r\nOur proposal contains a detailed account of the\r\npackage deal and the order of simultaneous action for a\r\ncomprehensive and fair solution of the nuclear issue,\r\nincluding abandonment of the hostile policy towards\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the\r\nconclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United\r\nStates, renunciation of the nuclear programme and\r\nnormalization of bilateral relations.\r\n27\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nSimultaneous action is a realistic way to\r\ndenuclearize the Korean peninsula, and any opposition\r\nto it is tantamount to rejecting denuclearization. Other\r\nStates participating in the Beijing talks also demanded\r\na package solution and simultaneous action, urging a\r\npeaceful settlement to the nuclear issue. However, the\r\nUnited States alone repeated its unilateral call for my\r\ncountry’s abandonment of nuclear weapons programme\r\nfirst, with no reference to the change of its hostile\r\npolicy which is the key to the solution of the nuclear\r\nissue. The United States even behaved imprudently,\r\nasserting that a non-aggression treaty is neither\r\nappropriate nor necessary and that it is not interested in\r\nsuch a treaty.\r\nThe United States went so far as to insist that if\r\nbilateral relations are to be normalized even after my\r\ncountry scraps its nuclear programme, a full range of\r\nother issues such as missiles, conventional weapons\r\nand human rights should be addressed. In a word, the\r\nposition of the United States is that it will discuss the\r\nsteps that it will take only after we have taken every\r\naction. Under the present circumstances, in which my\r\ncountry and the United States are levelling guns at each\r\nother, asking the other party to put down their guns\r\nfirst does not make any sense. This demand can only be\r\nconstrued as having the ulterior motive of disarming\r\nand eliminating my country.\r\nThe result of the six-party talks has convinced us\r\nonce again that the United States is seeking to disarm\r\nus by means of pressure and that it is still pursuing the\r\nhostile policy of stifling our country. Since it has been\r\nproven that the United States is only interested in\r\nturning the six-party talks into a ground for completely\r\ndisarming and eliminating my country by all means,\r\ninstead of co-existing peacefully with us, we have been\r\ncompelled not to maintain any interest in or\r\nexpectations for such talks.\r\nAs clearly stated, we have never made any\r\npromises with regard to the next round of the six-party\r\ntalks. All developments concerning the nuclear issue\r\nprove well that pressure can never be a means for\r\nsettlement of the nuclear issue and multiparty talks can\r\nbe fruitful only when there is commitment to the\r\nabandonment of the hostile policy towards my country.\r\nOur demand is modest and simple. We just want both\r\nsides to drop their guns simultaneously and co-exist\r\npeacefully.\r\nHaving reaffirmed the position of my\r\nGovernment, which I believe is the most reasonable\r\nand just in addressing the nuclear issue, I hope that the\r\nPresident and the United Nations Member States have a\r\ncorrect understanding of our position and actively\r\ncooperate for a fair solution of the nuclear issue and for\r\npeace on the Korean peninsula and in the region as a\r\nwhole.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea remains steadfast in its policy and\r\ndetermination to realize peace and the reunification of\r\nKorea and thus contribute to peace and security in the\r\nregion and in the rest of the world. Thanks to the ideas\r\nof national independence and great national unity of\r\nthe great leader General Kim Jong Il, the inter-Korean\r\nsummit meeting was held in Pyongyang for the first\r\ntime since the national division and the North-South\r\nJoint Declaration was made public on 15 June 2000.\r\nThat marked a turning point in accelerating national\r\nreunification through the concerted efforts of the entire\r\nKorean nation. Despite ups and downs in recent years,\r\nthere are active efforts to realize independent and\r\npeaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula under\r\nthe banner of the June 15 North-South Joint\r\nDeclaration.\r\nThis year alone, a series of North-South\r\nministerial-level talks were held and a groundbreaking\r\nceremony to re-link interrupted railways and roads took\r\nplace. Reunions of separated families and relatives\r\ntook place, and various economic exchanges are now\r\nunder way.\r\nOn 15 August, independence day, a splendid\r\nnational meeting for peace and reunification was held\r\nin Pyongyang that demonstrated once again the\r\naspirations and determination of all Korean nationals in\r\nthe North, the South and overseas for reunification.\r\nThe Government and people of the Democratic\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will achieve national\r\nreconciliation, unity and reunification and contribute to\r\nsecurity in the region and the rest of the world by fully\r\nimplementing the 15 June North-South Joint\r\nDeclaration, upholding the great idea of the respected\r\nGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\nAn important task before Member States at\r\npresent is to establish a just and equitable international\r\norder and relations, in keeping with the aspirations and\r\ndesire of all humankind.\r\n28\r\nA/58/PV.17\r\nTo that end, it is important, among others things,\r\nto ensure that the principle of respect for sovereignty\r\nand equality is fully observed in international relations.\r\nUnilateralism and high-handedness should be totally\r\nrejected and opposed, as they contravene the Charter\r\nand principles of international law.\r\nIn order to establish just international relations,\r\nthe functions and the role of the United Nations must\r\nbe enhanced and democratized. Democratizing the\r\nUnited Nations means decisively enhancing the\r\nauthority of the General Assembly and reforming the\r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe General Assembly should be empowered to\r\nreview resolutions of the Security Council on such\r\nissues as sanctions and the use of force directly\r\naffecting international peace and security and to submit\r\nits relevant recommendations.\r\nRegarding Security Council reform, we believe\r\nthat priority should be given to ensuring full\r\nrepresentation of the non-aligned and other developing\r\ncountries that constitute an overwhelming majority of\r\nthe United Nations membership.\r\nOur people graciously celebrated the fifty-fifth\r\nanniversary of the founding of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea on 9 September, thus demonstrating\r\nthe dignity and the might of the Kim Il Sung nation,\r\nfirmly united single-heartedly around the great leader\r\nGeneral Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s\r\nRepublic of Korea will continue, on the basis of\r\nindependence, peace and friendship — the fundamental\r\nideals of its foreign policy — to contribute actively to\r\ninternational efforts for a just, equitable and new world\r\norder by further intensifying cooperation with all\r\nMember States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Russian): We\r\nhave heard the last speaker inscribed on the list for the\r\ngeneral debate for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
