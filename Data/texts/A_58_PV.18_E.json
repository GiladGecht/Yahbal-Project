Hunte . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Saint Lucia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Alsaidi\r\n(Yemen), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 9 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk,\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Wangchuk (Bhutan): It gives my delegation\r\nimmense satisfaction to see Mr. Julian Hunte in the\r\nhigh office of the presidency, not only because of his\r\nwide experience and his proven abilities, but also\r\nbecause Saint Lucia — a small country like Bhutan —\r\nhas assumed leadership of the General Assembly at this\r\ncritical juncture of its history. We are confident that,\r\nunder his able leadership and guidance, our\r\ndeliberations on the many important and challenging\r\nissues that confront our world today will be fruitful.\r\nLet me also take this opportunity to express our deep\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for his excellent\r\nstewardship of the fifty-seventh session. His\r\npresidency enhanced the esteem of the international\r\ncommunity both for himself personally and for the\r\nCzech Republic.\r\nMy delegation would like to pay a special tribute\r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\r\ndynamic leadership and his tireless efforts to revitalize\r\nthe United Nations and to enable it to assume its\r\nrightful role at a very challenging time in our history.\r\nWe have gathered in this magnificent Hall year\r\nafter year, bound together by a common vision of a\r\npeaceful, prosperous and just world. The end of the\r\ncold war renewed our hope to bring to fruition our\r\ncollective aspirations, enshrined in the Charter of the\r\nUnited Nations. The historic Millennium Summit\r\nushered in a sense of optimism that we could bring\r\nabout a world free from want and fear. Unfortunately,\r\nthe horrific events of 11 September have shaken the\r\nvery foundations of our nascent faith in our ability to\r\ndeliver a new era of peace and prosperity. The situation\r\nin Iraq is a serious challenge to the international\r\ncommunity. Three years ago, we stood united and\r\nconfident about the prospects in the new millennium,\r\nproviding a ray of hope for millions around the world.\r\nToday, sadly, we stand as a house divided, uncertain\r\nabout the future and unsure whether we can rid the\r\nworld of the vicious circle of conflict, poverty and fear\r\nthat has plagued humankind for centuries.\r\nIt is clear that international peace and security\r\nand the eradication of poverty remain the most pressing\r\nchallenges confronting the international community.\r\nWhat must be recognized is the undeniable, but often\r\noverlooked, fact that those overarching goals are\r\ninterlinked and cannot be achieved in isolation. There\r\ncan be no prosperity without peace and security. At the\r\nsame time, peace and security cannot be sustained if\r\nbillions are deprived of the basic necessities of life.\r\nOur collective resolve to combat the menace of\r\nterrorism must be matched with an equal commitment\r\n2\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nto eradicate the scourge of poverty, which afflicts more\r\nthan half of the world’s population.\r\nWe welcome the President’s intention to focus the\r\nAssembly’s efforts on implementation of the outcomes\r\nof United Nations summits and conferences, including\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The realization of\r\na new economic order that is inclusive, equitable and\r\nsustainable is an imperative that must be pursued with\r\nrenewed focus and resolve. The Millennium\r\nDeclaration provides a clear set of targets and steps to\r\nbe undertaken to achieve them. The Monterrey\r\nConsensus, the Doha Development Agenda and the\r\nJohannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development\r\nprovided further impetus towards the attainment of the\r\nMillennium Development Goals. Yet 33 countries that\r\ntogether account for 26 per cent of the world’s\r\npopulation are reported to be off track on more than\r\nhalf of the Goals. The lack of progress so far is indeed\r\ndisconcerting.\r\nWhile emphasizing the need to accelerate the\r\nimplementation of commitments made by both\r\ndeveloped and developing countries at various\r\ninternational conferences, my delegation would like to\r\nhighlight the critical need for adequate financing\r\nmechanisms through trade, investment and official\r\ndevelopment assistance. In particular, my delegation\r\nhopes that the special needs and vulnerabilities of the\r\nleast developing countries, of the landlocked\r\ndeveloping countries and of the small island\r\ndeveloping States will be comprehensively addressed,\r\nas called for in the Brussels Programme of Action for\r\nthe Least Developed Countries, in the Almaty\r\nDeclaration and in the Barbados Plan of Action,\r\nrespectively.\r\nOf the 33 countries that are off track in achieving\r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, 23 are in sub-\r\nSaharan Africa, highlighting the need for special\r\nattention to Africa. My delegation calls on the\r\ninternational community to lend its full support to the\r\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment. International support is particularly\r\ncrucial for countries emerging from conflicts, for\r\nwithout the rehabilitation of social and economic\r\ninfrastructure, progress in peacemaking cannot be\r\nsustained. In that context, we hope that the\r\ninternational community will also provide the\r\nnecessary support to the peoples of Afghanistan and\r\nIraq as they endeavour to rebuild their nations under\r\nthe most trying circumstances.\r\nEvery Member State has the responsibility to\r\neradicate poverty and create an enabling environment\r\nfor peace and security. It is in the mutual interest of all\r\nnations, small or large, developed or developing, to\r\ncollectively promote global prosperity and peaceful\r\ncoexistence.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ngive the floor to His Excellency Mr. Nagoum\r\nYamassoum, Minister for Foreign Affairs and African\r\nIntegration of the Republic of Chad.\r\nMr. Yamassoum (Chad) (spoke in French): As in\r\nthe past, and despite present ordeals, Chad, my country,\r\nis very glad to take active part in this meeting of\r\npeoples united by the same fate and motivated by the\r\nsame spirit of peace, justice and equality.\r\nI am convinced that the wise choice of someone\r\nwith the experience and requisite skills of Mr. Julian\r\nHunte to preside over this historic meeting will\r\nguarantee the success of the session. My country has\r\nassumed similar responsibilities within the previous\r\nBureau and knows just how consuming yet exalting\r\nthey can be. My delegation would also like to express\r\nits encouragement and congratulations to Mr. Hunte\r\nand other members of the Bureau. My delegation and I,\r\npersonally, would like to assure him of our complete\r\navailability and full support for the success of his\r\nmission. We would like to reiterate our deep gratitude\r\nto him and especially to his predecessor, His\r\nExcellency Mr. Jan Kavan, for the skill and enthusiasm\r\nwith which he led the Assembly during the fifty-\r\nseventh session.\r\nAllow me also to express to His Excellency\r\nMr. Kofi Annan our sympathy and admiration for the\r\ncourage and the firm resolve that he places at the\r\nservice of the ideals and causes of the United Nations,\r\nwhich is now confronting many exceptional challenges.\r\nFinally, the Government of Chad would like to\r\nassociate itself with other members of the international\r\ncommunity to condemn in the strongest terms the\r\nterrorist attacks against the United Nations offices in\r\nIraq, which claimed the lives of several staff members\r\nof the United Nations, including the Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello. These heinous acts of violence should\r\nin no way break our resolve to pursue the noble goals\r\nof our Organization, foremost among which is to help\r\npeoples in difficulty to fully regain their rights to lead\r\n3\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\ntheir lives in conformity with the values of freedom,\r\ndemocracy and justice.\r\nI would therefore like to extend the condolences\r\nof the Chadian Government to all United Nations\r\npersonnel, and the Brazilian, Egyptian and other\r\nGovernments for the deaths of those who sacrificed\r\nthemselves for the freedom of others.\r\nIf the international community has been\r\nthoroughly overhauled since the fall of the Berlin Wall\r\nand the end of the cold war, it has been victim to a new\r\nkind of trauma since 11 September 2001. Since that\r\ntime, terrorism has been a dire threat to international\r\npeace and security. Globalization has complicated the\r\nrules of the game in trade between the North and the\r\nSouth, and new forms of conflict have emerged at the\r\nregional level.\r\nThe best response to all this must be based on\r\ncollective and joint action. As a full member of the\r\ninternational community, Chad, which is faithful to its\r\nquest for peace, strongly reaffirms its resolute\r\ncondemnation of any act of terrorism, act of violence\r\nor any use of force — in the defence of any cause — to\r\nresolve disputes among nations.. Such actions must be\r\ndealt with by our regional organizations first and\r\nforemost, and, if they fall short, to our common\r\nOrganization, the United Nations. Although it has been\r\nthe subject of some controversy, the United Nations\r\ncontinues to be the only Organization in the world to\r\ntruly enjoy international legitimacy.\r\nBut to continue to best ensure that its mission and\r\nfunctions are carried out and to maintain its legitimacy,\r\nour Organization must enjoy the full support of all\r\nMember States. We must all contribute to assisting it in\r\nregaining its principal mission. The United Nations\r\nmust once again become a common tool for us all and\r\nno longer be seen as showcase, much less a sounding\r\nboard, for the will and power of the few.\r\nIt will undoubtedly achieve this goal all the more\r\neasily if the long-postponed reforms are successful and\r\nreflected in the enlargement of the Security Council to\r\ninclude new or emerging Powers of Europe, Africa,\r\nAsia and the Americas — in sum, in recognition of the\r\ntrue state of the world today. This would do justice to\r\nthose nations and render a service to the Organization\r\nitself.\r\nIn that respect, the Iraqi crisis has only further\r\nconvinced us of the need to pursue those reforms. We\r\ncannot continually evade this crucial issue. Stability\r\nand international peace and security are at stake, for\r\nthe kind of globalization that our peoples seek cannot\r\nevolve in the interest of all if the international political\r\nsystem is predominantly unilateral in nature.\r\nPending this revolution, which all peoples who\r\ncherish justice ardently seek, we still note with\r\nsatisfaction that our Organization remains active in all\r\ncrisis areas, particularly in Africa, where we urge it to\r\nbe more proactive. Indeed, Africa is confronted with\r\nmany difficulties that have ensued from both wars and\r\nother crises, as well as from a lack of good governance.\r\nThe recent establishment of New Partnership for\r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD) promises to save the\r\ncontinent from the economic quagmire in which it has\r\nbeen plunged. But the coherence of this extensive\r\nprogramme is connected with the support of the entire\r\ninternational community. The anticipated outcome will\r\ndepend on true solidarity on the part of all economies\r\nworldwide.\r\nMy country, which has been committed to the\r\npath of democratic pluralism since 1 December 1990,\r\nhas made significant progress. These efforts will be\r\nsustained until we have perfected the republican\r\ninstitutions provided for under the Constitution of 31\r\nDecember 1996. The Government of Chad believes it\r\nimportant that this democratic process be achieved so\r\nthat the rule of law and also peace and prosperity,\r\nwhich are the ultimate goals, might be attained.\r\nTo that end, in 1999 the President of our Republic\r\npromulgated, a unique type of law that sets out\r\nmodalities for the use of oil revenues. This has resulted\r\nin a system in which a substantial part of this direct\r\nincome —10 per cent — is set aside for future\r\ngenerations, and the remaining 80 to 90 per cent\r\nremainder goes to priority sectors — those vital areas I\r\nmentioned earlier — and the region of production\r\nreceives 5 per cent.\r\nSecondly, the law provides for an office for the\r\ncontrol and surveillance of oil income. It is made up of\r\nnine members, including only one representing the\r\nGovernment, with five representing civil society and\r\ntwo the Parliament. As an independent body, that office\r\nwill have broad powers and prerogatives, including\r\nauthorizing expenditures from oil revenue and\r\nverification of their proper use.\r\nIn this new international context, in which States\r\nare increasingly interdependent and in which the world\r\n4\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nhas truly become a village, Chad, while addressing its\r\ninternal problems, is endeavouring to open itself to the\r\noutside world. It is following with great interest\r\ndevelopments in the international political situation\r\nand is working to make its modest contribution to the\r\nefforts of the international community in settling\r\nconflicts, especially in Africa.\r\nTherefore, we note with satisfaction, in the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the new awareness\r\nof the parties involved and the emerging understanding,\r\nby the Congolese people themselves, of the enlightened\r\nself-interest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nWe fervently hope that the transition process will\r\ncontinue uninterrupted until the final return of stability\r\nto that fraternal country.\r\nIn the Central African Republic, realities in the\r\nfield have shown positive change, but it is up to our\r\nCentral African brothers to close their ranks to an even\r\ngreater extent in order to consolidate peace in their\r\ncountry. The national dialogue under way offers them\r\nan excellent opportunity for a deep and constructive\r\nprocess of reflection on ways of bringing about\r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nWith respect to our border with the Sudan, we\r\nwelcome most particularly the prospects for peace that\r\nhave been emerging in that long-suffering country.\r\nAccords were concluded on 3 September 2003 under\r\nthe auspices of President Idriss Deby at Abeche in\r\nChad, between the Government of the Sudan and the\r\nPeople’s Liberation Army of the Sudan, and the\r\nprotocol on security questions signed on 25 September\r\nbetween the Government and the SPLA also is a\r\nwelcome development on the path to peace. Chad\r\nencourages the two parties to do their utmost to\r\nconclude a genuine peace agreement that would put an\r\nend to the sufferings of that fraternal country.\r\nWe note with satisfaction a trend towards peace\r\nand stability in West Africa. For us, the Ivorian crisis\r\nwas a serious cause for concern. The Marcoussis\r\nagreements gave rise to a real hope finally to see a\r\npeaceful solution emerge. Today all eyes are turned to\r\nAbidjan, where the Transitional Government has the\r\nheavy responsibility of conducting national\r\nreconciliation in the interest of all the children of that\r\ncountry. Chad encourages the Ivorian people to help\r\nthe Transitional Government to carry out its mission,\r\nso that peace might be consolidated in Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nWith regard to Liberia, we hope that, with\r\ncontinued international assistance, its situation will\r\nbecome stabilized. The participation of the countries of\r\nthe subregion in peacekeeping operations and the\r\npresence of the Economic Community of West African\r\nStates Mission in Liberia in Monrovia all give rise to\r\nhope and are a guarantee of political stability. The\r\nadoption of resolution 1497 (2003) was very timely. It\r\nrepresents a framework for settlement which should be\r\nused finally to break the infernal cycle of violence in\r\nthat country. We would therefore like to ask the parties\r\nto the conflict to overcome their differences and work\r\ntowards the return of a just and lasting peace.\r\nI cannot conclude my words on Africa without\r\njoining my voice to those of other delegations that\r\nspoke earlier from this rostrum and welcoming finally\r\nthe wise decision of the Security Council to lift the\r\nembargo that for years had penalized the fraternal\r\npeople of Libya.\r\nOutside of Africa, other hotbeds of tension\r\nremain, especially in the Near and Middle East, that\r\nrequire the involvement of the international community\r\nin the quest for adequate solutions. In the Middle East,\r\nthe Israeli-Arab conflict has long been one of the\r\nconcerns of the United Nations. Today conditions seem\r\nto have been met for a constructive dialogue between\r\nthe two neighbouring peoples, since the road map\r\ncontaining the peace plan was agreed to by the parties\r\nto the conflict. This peace plan will, it is hoped, allow\r\nPalestine to achieve, by the year 2005, national\r\nindependence and international sovereignty.\r\nRegarding the Middle East, the Republic of Chad\r\nwelcomes the interest shown by the international\r\ncommunity in the restoration of Iraq’s sovereignty and\r\nindependence. We hope that the process of restoring\r\npower to the Iraqis will continue pursuant to Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1483 (2003) in a way that best\r\nserves the interests of the Iraqi people.\r\nIn East Asia, the question of the proliferation of\r\nnuclear weapons, territorial conflicts and terrorist\r\nattacks are jeopardizing stability, not just for States in\r\nthe region but for the entire world. Nevertheless, we\r\nare pleased to note that a dynamic for peace has\r\ndefinitely begun to prevail in that region. We welcome,\r\ntherefore, the holding of multilateral talks on the North\r\nKorean nuclear programme, and we encourage States\r\nin the region, whose role in this respect is crucial, to\r\n5\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nbecome truly involved in order to facilitate the quest\r\nfor a final settlement of that crisis.\r\nWe welcome also with relief the significant\r\nimprovement that has taken place in the context of\r\nrelations between India and Pakistan. This favourable\r\nclimate will no doubt enable the two nuclear Powers to\r\nmaintain good-neighbourly relations and to undertake\r\nthe true problems of development.\r\nAbove and beyond these conflicts, which are all\r\nof great concern, there remain two major issues with\r\nwhich the international community has not dealt with\r\ncourageously, in spite of good intentions and of the\r\nresolutions adopted in various forums beginning with\r\nthe Millennium Summit. I am speaking of development\r\nassistance and of the fight against HIV/AIDS. Both are\r\nMillennium Development Goals with respect to which\r\ncommitments were entered into here, in June 2001, at\r\nthe special session on HIV/AIDS, and at Monterrey in\r\nMarch 2002.\r\nWhile it is encouraging to note that the heads of\r\nState or Government of the Group of Eight, at their\r\nmost recent Summit in May 2003, gave their support to\r\nthe achievement of those goals, they still have to\r\ntranslate such commitments into action, as was\r\nemphasized by the Secretary-General in his report on\r\nthe work of the Organization.\r\nThat means, inter alia, that developed States\r\nshould implement the outcome of the Monterrey\r\nConsensus and the results of the Johannesburg World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in August 2002.\r\nBut the conclusions of the most recent World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) Conference in Cancún have\r\nshown that we have not yet embarked on that path.\r\nWe must all translate into action the Summit’s\r\nresolutions on HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and\r\nother infectious diseases. Indeed, in spite of the\r\nincrease in resources and the strengthening of the\r\npolitical commitment at the highest level — following\r\nthe example of the commitment made by the President\r\nof the Republic of Chad — the situation remains one of\r\ngreat concern and calls for unfailing determination and\r\nexceptional efforts in order to stem this pandemic. I\r\nwould almost say that we must invent a new kind of\r\ncontainment in order to stem the spread of this disease.\r\nIn any case, the disease is waging a brutal war\r\nagainst humankind, which must respond by utilizing\r\nthe means required to fight a global war. This is a\r\nprerequisite for the survival of many nations\r\nthroughout the world and therefore for the stability of\r\nour future world.\r\nI cannot conclude without drawing the attention\r\nof the international community to the crucial issue of\r\nthe representation of the Republic of China on Taiwan\r\nin our Organization. That country has diplomatic\r\nrelations and relations of cooperation with many\r\nMember States, including Chad. Paradoxically,\r\nhowever, with regard to the United Nations, it finds\r\nitself without any status. Its ostracism is unjustified\r\nand unjustifiable.\r\nIndeed, the Republic of China was one of the\r\nfounders of the United Nations and was represented\r\nhere from 1949 through 1971. The fact that this item\r\ncomes up each and every year in the debates of the\r\nGeneral Assembly proves that a substantive issue is at\r\nstake. Chad deems it inadmissible for 23 million\r\nTaiwanese to be discriminated against by the United\r\nNations and its specialized agencies. It is thus\r\nunfortunate to note that, in the current context, the\r\nWorld Health Organization, for example, cannot lend\r\nTaiwan assistance in the event of epidemics, which was\r\nrecently the case with severe acute respiratory\r\nsyndrome. Yet the Taiwanese also have the right to live\r\nin serenity, to lead a democratic life and to be in\r\nsolidarity with the world’s other peoples. They need\r\npeace — the very foundation of democracy and a\r\ncondition for development. Peace presupposes the\r\nresolution of conflicts through mediation. That implies,\r\nin both hearts and minds, a culture of tolerance and\r\nrespect for differences.\r\nWe urge this session to put an end to Taiwan’s\r\nexclusion by restoring its status as a full-fledged\r\nUnited Nations Member, and we take this opportunity\r\nto invite all States in the region to halt the military\r\nescalation.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Kokou Tozoun, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Togolese\r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Tozoun (Togo) (spoke in French): Again this\r\nyear, we are meeting to assess our actions and to define\r\napproaches that can breathe new life into the\r\nOrganization. Far from becoming a routine, our annual\r\nmeeting is the high point in the life of the\r\nOrganization, in that it offers to each Member State,\r\nthrough a frank and constructive debate, an opportunity\r\n6\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nto make its contribution to the building of peace and\r\nsecurity, which are indispensable to the just and lasting\r\ndevelopment of our countries. It is also an opportunity\r\nfor us to reaffirm the paramount role of the United\r\nNations in the world and to find appropriate ways to\r\nstrengthen the Organization further.\r\nBefore I proceed, let me express — on behalf of\r\nthe President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency\r\nMr. Gnassingbé Eyadema, and of the Government and\r\nthe people of Togo, whom I have the honour to\r\nrepresent at this rostrum — my warm congratulations\r\non the election of Mr. Julian Hunte as President of the\r\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-eighth session. Our\r\ncongratulations go also to the other members of the\r\nBureau. They can be assured of the full availability and\r\ncooperation of the Togolese delegation. I should also\r\nlike to express our appreciation and profound gratitude\r\nto Mr. Hunte’s predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, who led the\r\nwork of the fifty-seventh session of the Assembly with\r\ndexterity and skill. To the Secretary-General, we\r\nreaffirm how much we admire him for the work that he\r\ncontinues to lead at the head of the Organization.\r\nThis General Assembly session is taking place at\r\na particular time of evolution for the United Nations.\r\nIndeed, in the light of the grave events being\r\nexperienced by today’s world, the United Nations\r\nneeds more than ever before to be strengthened so that\r\nit can fully accomplish the primary tasks entrusted to it\r\nby the Charter: inter alia, maintaining international\r\npeace and security and serving as a forum where the\r\nefforts of nations can be harmonized towards the\r\nachievement of collective development and shared\r\nwell-being. It is obvious that the Organization’s\r\npurposes and principles retain all their relevance and\r\nremain guideposts for action on the part of the\r\ninternational community.\r\nIn my delegation’s view, this session must\r\nintensify its reflection with a view to defining new\r\napproaches that will enable the United Nations to\r\nsearch for more viable and lasting solutions to the\r\nproblems of peace, security and development, which\r\ndaily challenge the entire international community. We\r\nmust therefore support United Nations actions,\r\nespecially at a time when peoples are aspiring to more\r\nfreedom and democracy and to greater involvement in\r\nthe management of civic affairs.\r\nThe democratic wind that is blowing through our\r\ncountry is far more than an irresistible movement for\r\nrenewal; it holds immense hopes for our people. For\r\nTogo, that is what has justified the people’s support for\r\nthe political reform that the Government has been\r\nundertaking for more than a decade and a half. Here, I\r\nshould like to recall the faith and determination with\r\nwhich the Togolese Government — spurred on by of its\r\nhead of State — is striving to build a democratic\r\nsociety that will take everyone’s legitimate aspirations\r\ninto account and that is rooted in the country’s\r\nsociological realities. In essence, we are engaged in\r\nthis democratization process in the conviction that the\r\ntask — which will be long-term — requires much\r\nresolve, patience and self-sacrifice.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I should like to stress that,\r\nthrough the recent presidential election — which was\r\nfree, honest and fair in the general view of\r\nobservers — a broad majority of the Togolese people\r\ndemonstrated their political maturity and their keen\r\nsense of the general interest, which must take\r\nprecedence over partisan and personal interests. In any\r\nevent, I can assure the Assembly that the Togolese\r\npeople — who know how to go the extra mile — are\r\ndetermined to move forward. The Government, for its\r\npart, is resolved to continue the process of\r\ndemocratization and establishing the rule of law,\r\nstrengthening its foundations through the local and\r\nsenatorial elections whose preparations are now under\r\nway.\r\nOne can never emphasize enough that the\r\ndifficulties related to the whole democratization\r\nprocess are not limited to one country or to a specific\r\ngroup of countries; they are inherent in any endeavour\r\nwhose objective is to involve people in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs. The path towards\r\ndemocracy is long and fraught with pitfalls, but we are\r\nworking tirelessly to provide the country with\r\ndemocratic institutions which are indispensable to the\r\nproper functioning under a rule of law. The quest for\r\ndemocracy — a contemporary development that Togo\r\nfully endorses — is a complex undertaking that\r\nrequires time. Indeed, democracy can take shape only\r\nin an environment of peace and security, which alone\r\ncan guarantee gradual assimilation of democratic\r\nvalues that are well understood and that emanate from\r\nthe wisdom of the culture and traditions of the peoples\r\nconcerned. In that spirit, Togo is striving to establish\r\nthe rule of law in the hope that we will be understood\r\nby our partners.\r\n7\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nToday, we can affirm that, despite the difficulties\r\nbesetting our march towards the establishment of\r\ndemocracy, encouraging and concrete results have been\r\nachieved. Above and beyond institutional development,\r\nensuring full human rights in all their aspects is a\r\nparamount necessity. Here, we wish to emphasize the\r\nTogolese Government’s primary concern to guarantee\r\nand promote the economic, social and cultural rights of\r\nall Togolese citizens. The realization of those rights is\r\nof particular importance, for in them lie the interests of\r\ndemocracy and the stability of the Republic’s\r\ninstitutions.\r\nIndeed, if one takes a careful look at Africa’s\r\ncontemporary history, one will note that the many\r\nsudden changes and various attempts challenging\r\ndemocratic institutions in some countries result less\r\nfrom a misunderstanding of the democratic process\r\nthan from the economic and financial difficulties felt\r\nby various social strata. The success of the democratic\r\nundertaking is therefore a function of the economic\r\npossibilities of the States that are engaged in it, and\r\nestablishing institutions requires considerable\r\nresources that our countries cannot muster at the\r\ncurrent stage of their development without foreign aid.\r\nIf that observation is universally shared, why impose\r\nsanctions against — and suspend cooperation with — a\r\ncountry that, like many other States, has encountered\r\ndifficulties in implementing its democratization policy\r\nand is undertaking notable efforts to establish the rule\r\nof law? Does my country, Togo, deserve the treatment\r\nthat it has received for the past 10 years?\r\nI would like, once again, to appeal for the\r\nresumption of cooperation with Togo. That is the\r\nappeal of an entire people. Peace and security, which\r\nreign in Togo, and the outstanding efforts to ensure\r\neconomic and social development, despite the\r\nsuspension of aid, clearly support the expectations of\r\nthe Togolese people.\r\nWhile the elimination of poverty is considered an\r\nessential task to be tackled to help a people or a\r\ncountry rebuild, it is also the same thing as giving it the\r\nmeans to consolidate democracy, which is essential to\r\nbuild a more just and peaceful world.\r\nThe need for solidarity, justice and equity must\r\nlead the international community, particularly the\r\nEuropean Union and other development partners, to\r\nreconsider their position and to commit to supporting\r\nthe reconstruction effort in Togo, a country that has\r\nmade peace and security the very foundation of its\r\ninternal and external policies.\r\nThat said, Togo believes firmly that the use of\r\nsanctions, if not properly measured and without time\r\nlimits, will only increase people’s poverty, particularly\r\nthat of women, the elderly and children. Such sanctions\r\nprovide, therefore, fertile ground for disorder and\r\nanarchy. The Assembly must, therefore, think about\r\nthis question more deeply.\r\nOur faith in peace and security is reflected in the\r\nconcrete results of a bold and visionary economic\r\npolicy, which is carried out untiringly, despite adverse\r\ntimes. This conviction is also justified by the fact that\r\npeace and social cohesion remain, undoubtedly, the\r\nbasic factors, without which any socio-economic\r\ndevelopment would be carried out ineffectively and\r\nwith only illusory results. Peace and security are,\r\ntherefore, priorities for all countries, whether they are\r\nin Africa or elsewhere in the world.\r\nAt the African level, the head of State of Togo is\r\nvery engaged in the process of conflict settlement. By\r\nway of example, let me recall prior outstanding and\r\neffective mediation efforts in which he played a role in\r\nsettling crises that have afflicted Chad, Sierra Leone,\r\nthe Great Lakes region, Guinea-Bissau and, most\r\nrecently, Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nRegarding its contribution to peacekeeping\r\noperations, I wish to recall that Togo is contributing in\r\na meaningful and active way to the deployment of\r\nmilitary or police contingents at the subregional level\r\nor in United Nations peacekeeping operations; in\r\nNamibia in 1989, in Rwanda in 1993, in Haiti in 1993,\r\nin the Central African Republic in 1997, in Guinea-\r\nBissau in 1999, and recently in Côte d’Ivoire and\r\nLiberia.\r\nWith regard to Liberia, we welcome the\r\nestablishment by the Security Council, on 19\r\nSeptember 2003, of the United Nations Mission in\r\nLiberia, which will be deployed on 1 October — in just\r\na few hours. It will contribute to supporting in a\r\nmeaningful way the peacekeeping force of the\r\nEconomic Community of West African States\r\n(ECOWAS).\r\nMy country, which contributed to restoring that\r\npeace by sending a contingent, urges the wealthy\r\ncountries to contribute to financing the United Nations\r\n8\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nforce in order to provide it with the necessary means to\r\naccomplish its mission.\r\nIn the Great Lakes region, particularly the\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Togolese\r\nGovernment hopes ardently that the new stage,\r\ncharacterized by the establishment of a new\r\nGovernment and other transitional institutions, will\r\nlead to stability, unity and national reconciliation.\r\nIn Burundi, my country welcomed the significant\r\nprogress made on the basis of the Arusha Agreement,\r\nand it urges the parties to the conflict to work\r\nresolutely toward restoring peace to the country. Togo\r\nis very involved in the settlement of disputes in Africa,\r\ndemonstrating clearly its firm determination to\r\ncontribute to maintaining and to consolidating peace in\r\nthe African continent. It was in that context that the\r\nPresident of the Togolese Republic advocated the\r\nestablishment of an African peacekeeping force at the\r\n1994 summit of the Organization of African Unity.\r\nIt is worth noting that that idea made headway in\r\nthe Organization of African Unity, as is attested by the\r\nadoption at Durban, South Africa, of a protocol on the\r\nestablishment of the Peace and Security Council of the\r\nAfrican Union, which demonstrates the determination\r\nof Africans to be the builders themselves of peace in\r\nAfrica. It is also comforting to note that, within the\r\ncontext of that protocol, the establishment of a pre-\r\npositioned African peace force and a continental early\r\nwarning system are taking shape.\r\nMy country is committed to making its\r\ncontribution to the implementation of this collective\r\napproach to questions of defence, peace and security in\r\nAfrica, and calls on the international community to\r\nfirmly support the African continent with a view to\r\nguaranteeing the success of this effort.\r\nOutside of Africa, we are constantly watching\r\nIraq and the Middle East, always in the grip of\r\nviolence. Regarding the Middle East in particular, my\r\ncountry considers that the definitive settlement of the\r\nPalestinian question, which is at the heart of the\r\nconflict in the region, necessarily requires the cessation\r\nof violence and counter-violence and consideration of\r\nthe legitimate rights of both people — the right of\r\nIsrael to live in full security within internationally\r\nrecognized borders and that of the Palestinian people to\r\nfully enjoy their national rights, including the\r\nestablishment of a State.\r\nIn that context, we encourage Israelis and\r\nPalestinians to pursue dialogue, with a view to\r\nachieving a negotiated and comprehensive settlement\r\nof the Middle East question.\r\nDespite a new environment conducive to\r\neconomic expansion, poverty continues to increase and\r\nremains a striking and paradoxical feature of our era.\r\nPeace and security will constantly be threatened if\r\nmeasures of justice are not adopted to push back the\r\nborders of poverty that weaken the foundations of our\r\nsociety.\r\nThe economic situation of developing countries,\r\nparticularly in Africa, is a matter of great concern. The\r\nexternal debt burden, instability in export income and\r\nthe devastating effects stemming from deterioration in\r\nterms of trade have largely contributed to aggravating\r\nthe deterioration of socio-economic conditions in many\r\nAfrican countries.\r\nSpeaking of international trade, it is unfortunate\r\nto note that, despite liberalization of the economy,\r\nindustrialized countries continue to practice\r\nprotectionist measures in the industrial and agricultural\r\nsectors. These measures, particularly harmful to\r\ndeveloping countries, particularly African countries,\r\nimpede the efforts made to restore increased export\r\nincome.\r\nLike many other delegations, Togo demands,\r\ntherefore, that protectionist practices and subsidies be\r\nended. That would contribute significantly to the\r\ndevelopment of poor countries. We believe that\r\nglobalization must be accompanied by a greater spirit\r\nof solidarity and by a policy aimed at the purchase of\r\nproducts from the South at fairer and more lucrative\r\nprices.\r\nIn that regard, the Togolese Government wishes\r\nto emphasize that, if they are to benefit all, the rules of\r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) must take into\r\naccount the deep aspirations of developing countries,\r\nwhich demand that they be able to participate in\r\ninternational trade in conditions of equality and justice,\r\nas recently emphasized at Cancún.\r\nAt a time when our continent is doing its utmost\r\nto make the African Union the priority instrument to\r\nensure peace and security and economic and social\r\nprosperity, the international community must become\r\nmore involved to assist economic recovery efforts of\r\n9\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nour States, in order to meet the challenges they face,\r\nsuch as poverty, the AIDS pandemic and malaria.\r\nIt is important that our common Organization\r\nmobilize its efforts even more in order to fight the evils\r\nthat afflict the world and make it vulnerable. Terrorism\r\nwould definitely be included among those evils. The\r\nterrible events of 11 September 2001 and the recent\r\ndeadly attacks against the United Nations headquarters\r\nin Iraq and elsewhere, still alive within us, compel us\r\nto act promptly to eradicate this evil. My country,\r\nwhich has frequently been the victim of terrorist\r\naggression, in 1977, 1985, 1986, 1993, 1994 and 1998,\r\nrecognizes the importance of that challenge. This task\r\nshould be one of our highest priorities if we wish to\r\ngive future generations a sound world, in which respect\r\nfor human dignity, love and fraternity are the\r\nfoundation.\r\nIn order to achieve those aims, the United\r\nNations must assume greater responsibility and provide\r\nmore resources. It certainly needs to be substantially\r\nreformed. We would like to welcome the relevant\r\nproposals of the Secretary-General to establish a panel\r\nof eminent personalities from civil society to address\r\nthis issue. We remain convinced that our actions, taken\r\ntogether, will lead to the reign of a society free from\r\nselfishness, violence, terrorism, disease and the threat\r\nof nuclear confrontation. May the work of this session\r\nlead each of our States to resolutely follow the path\r\ntowards peace and ensure that all peoples, without\r\ndiscrimination, can enjoy the fruits of progress made\r\nby humanity in a climate of tolerance, justice,\r\nfraternity and solidarity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now\r\ngive the floor to Mr. Hidipo Hamutenya, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Hamutenya (Namibia): Mr. President, my\r\ndelegation congratulates you on your assumption of\r\nthis high office. We are confident that, given your vast\r\nexperience and consummate diplomatic skill, you will\r\nbe able to successfully manage the proceedings of this\r\nsession of the General Assembly. I also wish to express\r\nour appreciation for the excellent and effective manner\r\nin which your predecessor, Mr. Jan Kavan, conducted\r\nthe work of the fifty-seventh session. In the same vein,\r\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General for his\r\nefforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in\r\nresolving the world’s burning issues.\r\nAllow me also to pay tribute to the international\r\nworkers who have recently given their lives in service\r\nto the United Nations in Iraq. In particular, we reiterate\r\nour condolences to the Secretary-General and the\r\nOrganization for the tragic death of Sergio Vieira de\r\nMello, that outstanding servant of the United Nations.\r\nAs we condemn terrorism and violence in all their\r\nforms and manifestations, we honour the memory of\r\nAnna Lindh, the slain Foreign Minister of Sweden,\r\nwho dedicated her life to the pursuit of peace,\r\ndevelopment and social progress.\r\nWe appear here before this Assembly every year\r\nto renew our vow to the United Nations as the main\r\nguarantor of international peace and security. The\r\nspeeches that we deliver here are a distilled expression\r\nof our collective passion for and conviction about the\r\nideals that the United Nations stands for.\r\nYet, at times, as was the case with the war on\r\nIraq, the United Nations gets sidelined and the unique\r\nlegitimacy of its authority undermined through\r\nunilateral actions. Such actions produced a general\r\nfeeling of fear and uncertainty, especially among the\r\nsmall and weak nations of the world. This is why the\r\ncentral theme that runs through nearly all the speeches\r\nat this session is the call for a return to multilateral\r\ndialogue, persuasion and collective action as the only\r\nappropriate approach to resolving the many conflicts\r\nfacing the international community. Being a small\r\ncountry, Namibia echoes this call. Multilateralism must\r\nbe the basis of global security, if smaller countries are\r\nnot to feel that they are at the mercy of stronger ones.\r\nBut, as recent events have demonstrated, big Powers,\r\nlike the smaller ones, also need a multilateral\r\nframework as a more reassuring environment for the\r\nexecution of foreign policy.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nWe cannot fail to re-emphasize the inseparable\r\nlink between international security and economic\r\ndevelopment. Therefore, the Organization must uphold\r\nthe commitments made in the field of economic\r\ndevelopment, especially the important pledges made at\r\nthe Millennium Summit and contained in the\r\nMillennium Declaration.\r\nIn that Declaration, world leaders committed\r\nthemselves to help lift half of the world’s poor out of\r\nmisery and deprivation by the year 2015. We are\r\ntalking here of 1.5 billion people around the world who\r\n10\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nare today victims of abject poverty and 800 million\r\nwho are starving. Still more, we are talking about the\r\n900 million adults worldwide who are illiterate.\r\nThe tragedy is that this human misery is acquiring\r\ndeepening and broadening dimensions at a time when\r\nhuman ingenuity is ever enlarging the horizons of\r\npossibilities of doing away with this terrible scourge of\r\nextreme poverty and deprivation. Clearly, therefore, the\r\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration is a race\r\nagainst time. Failure to act now, and to do so with a\r\nsense of urgency, will mean that we, especially the rich\r\nof this world, have failed to rise to the moral and\r\npolitical challenge, which is to protect that most sacred\r\nof all human rights, the right to life.\r\nNamibia is fully committed to the implementation\r\nof the Millennium Declaration. To this end, we allocate\r\n23 per cent of our annual national budget to education\r\nand 15 per cent to health. In this commitment to invest\r\nin our people, we have proceeded from the premise that\r\na fundamental way to address the problem of poverty is\r\nto improve the productive competitiveness of our\r\neconomy, and that improving that competitiveness is\r\ndependant on the rapid increase in the knowledge,\r\nskills and capacities of the people, with a view to\r\nempowering them to be able to escape from the trap of\r\npoverty. Skills in the field of information technology\r\nare a critical element of our human resources\r\ndevelopment programme.\r\nThe other urgent challenge, spelled out in the\r\nMillennium Declaration, is the fight against the AIDS\r\npandemic. Namibia is devoting considerable resources\r\nand attention to this seemingly daunting battle to\r\ncontain the spread and limit the impact of this epidemic\r\non our society. In this effort, we are working with other\r\ncountries, relevant United Nations agencies, the private\r\nsector and members of civil society. In the context of\r\nthis battle, the plight of AIDS orphans is given priority.\r\nHowever, there is a need for more generous\r\ncontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\r\nTuberculosis and Malaria.\r\nIn the pursuit of Millennium Development Goals,\r\nNamibia is, furthermore, working closely with its\r\npartners in the Southern African Development\r\nCommunity (SADC) to implement a number of key\r\nregional projects. One of these is a major power\r\nproject, involving the power utilities of Angola,\r\nBotswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\r\nSouth Africa and Namibia.\r\nSimilarly, Namibia, together with Angola,\r\nBotswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe, has embarked on\r\none of the world’s largest regional wildlife\r\nconservation and tourism development projects. The\r\ngeographical scope of this area cuts across the\r\nterritories of all five countries and covers\r\napproximately 278,000 square kilometres.\r\nWe would like, therefore, to reassure the\r\nSecretary-General that Namibia has, indeed, started in\r\nearnest on the implementation of the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and is staying the course. However, as I\r\nsaid earlier, there is still a great need for additional\r\nresources so that we can intensify our efforts aimed at\r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\r\nFor more than a decade now, the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Member States, including Namibia, have\r\nbeen calling for the reform of the institutions of the\r\nOrganization, especially the Security Council.\r\nAt the time of the founding of the United Nations\r\nin 1945, the Organization consisted of only 51 Member\r\nStates. That number has now grown to 191 sovereign\r\nStates. But the structure of the United Nations has\r\nremained in some respects unchanged.\r\nThe Security Council needs to become\r\ndemocratic and more representative — allowing other\r\nregions and States to be represented. There is a broad\r\nconsensus that by making it a democratic body, and\r\nmore representative, we would give the Security\r\nCouncil greater legitimacy and that that, in turn, would\r\nmean more effective United Nations machinery.\r\nThis call for reform is in line with the principle of\r\ndemocratic governance so often demanded of the\r\ndeveloping countries by, among others, some of the\r\nPowers that occupy permanent seats in the Security\r\nCouncil.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the Secretary-General\r\nhas taken on board the reform of the United Nations,\r\nand that it is one of the higher priorities on his agenda.\r\nWe have noted with great interest his plan to set up a\r\npanel of eminent personalities to look into the reform\r\nprocess and recommend ways of effecting such a\r\nreform.\r\nOne of the issues that underlines the need for the\r\nurgent reform of the Security Council is the pathetic\r\ninability of that organ to bring the authority of the\r\nUnited Nations to bear on the situation in the Middle\r\nEast. The unrelenting carnage that is taking place in\r\n11\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nthat region has not compelled the Powers that be to\r\naccept the fact that that situation constitutes a threat to\r\ninternational peace and security. Because of a lack of\r\npolitical will in the Security Council, there has been no\r\nability to act collectively to put a stop to the carnage.\r\nThe continued occupation of the Palestinian\r\nterritory exacerbates frustration and despair among the\r\nPalestinians. It follows, therefore, that the end of the\r\noccupation and the establishment of a Palestinian State,\r\nexisting side by side with Israel, is key to peace and\r\nstability in that region.\r\nThe implementation of the Security Council’s\r\nplan for Western Sahara would have closed the chapter\r\non decolonization in Africa. The right of the people of\r\nWestern Sahara to self-determination and independence\r\nis a Charter obligation that we cannot shirk.\r\nWe hail the efforts of the Economic Community\r\nof West African States in Liberia and welcome the\r\nestablishment of the United Nations Mission in that\r\ncountry. Guided by our commitment to African\r\nsolidarity and given the resolve of the African Union to\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace\r\nand security, Namibia has decided to contribute troops\r\nto the United Nations Mission in Liberia.\r\nGeographic proximity is not a matter of choice.\r\nWe abhor the continued imposition of the United States\r\nembargo against the people of Cuba, and call on the\r\ninternational community to demand the immediate\r\nlifting of that embargo.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress the vital\r\nimportance of international cooperation by all\r\nstakeholders in our effort to realize the Millennium\r\nDevelopment Goals. In order to reduce the scourge of\r\npoverty and underdevelopment, developing countries\r\nneed access to the markets of developed countries.\r\nThere is, therefore, an urgent need to overcome\r\nthe impasse which has developed as result of the\r\nfailure of the World Trade Organization Ministerial\r\nConference at Cancún. We need to emphasize that\r\nurgent need. We call on the developed countries to\r\ndemonstrate a spirit of compromise in line with their\r\nundertakings at the Millennium Summit.\r\nFurthermore the implementation of the decisions\r\ntaken at the Monterrey Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment must not be allowed to become a dead\r\nletter. The promise made by world leaders at the\r\nMillennium Summit to give globalization a human face\r\nshould also be given practical expression.\r\nIn short, the vision of a bright and prosperity-\r\nenhancing new Millennium must not be allowed to\r\nbecome a mirage or a dream that could not be realized.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Sodiq Safoev, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nMr. Safoev (Uzbekistan): I should like first of all\r\nto join earlier speakers in congratulating you, Sir, The\r\nHonourable Julian Robert Hunte, Minister for External\r\nAffairs, International Trade and Civil Aviation of Saint\r\nLucia, on your election as President of the General\r\nAssembly and to wish you every success as you carry\r\nout your duties. I would also like to extend our\r\nappreciation to Mr. Jan Kavan for the very efficient\r\nway in which he organized the work of the fifty-\r\nseventh session of the General Assembly.\r\nWe would like at the outset to express our\r\nprofound condolences to the whole family of the\r\nUnited Nations for the loss of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a\r\nbrave and able diplomat, and the other United Nations\r\npersonnel who died as a result of the deadly attack\r\nagainst the United Nations premises in Baghdad.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to outline the\r\nposition of Uzbekistan on the key issues on the agenda\r\nof this forum. As is well known, since the events of 11\r\nSeptember 2001, the world has been on the verge of a\r\nfundamental transformation caused by new challenges\r\nand threats to security in many regions of our planet.\r\nThis harsh reality unequivocally increases the\r\nresponsibility of the United Nations as a unique\r\ninternational institution whose role cannot be\r\nsubstituted by anyone or anything. It also increases the\r\nresponsibility of each and every nation to preserve\r\npeace and stability in countering threats to modern\r\ncivilization such as international terrorism, extremism,\r\nand the ever-growing illegal drug trade.\r\nGiven our immediate proximity to Afghanistan,\r\nwe, the nations of Central Asia, know at first hand\r\nwhat these threats are and what they can bring to the\r\nworld, if timely steps are not taken to prevent and\r\neliminate them at their very core. In this context, it is\r\ndifficult to overestimate the significance of the actions\r\nof the international anti-terrorist coalition led by the\r\nUnited States of America and of the International\r\nSecurity Assistance Force, which are doing so much to\r\n12\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nrevive and restore peace and stability in long-suffering\r\nAfghanistan.\r\nIn the meantime, despite the prerequisites for a\r\nfull-scale peace process in Afghanistan and sustained\r\ndevelopment of the region, the peace in the country is\r\nstill fragile. We believe that the resources of the\r\ninternational community, major international\r\norganizations and donor nations, as well as the\r\ncapabilities of neighbouring countries, should be more\r\nintensely engaged, as they are essential to post-conflict\r\nreconstruction.\r\nAfghanistan should become a harmoniously\r\nintegrated part of Central Asia, and this will positively\r\ncontribute to the enhancement of stability and security\r\nin the country and region. In view of the exceptional\r\nimportance of the socio-economic rehabilitation of\r\nAfghanistan, Uzbekistan is rendering assistance to the\r\nAfghan people in the reconstruction of damaged roads\r\nand the construction of new ones, as well as supplying\r\nelectricity to the northern provinces of Afghanistan.\r\nUzbek specialists have built eight large bridges along\r\nthe road from Mazari Sharif to Kabul. Uzbekistan is\r\nalso delivering humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.\r\nMore than 1 million tonnes of humanitarian cargo have\r\nbeen shipped through our country’s territory. We will\r\ncontinue to cooperate with international organizations,\r\nforemost with the United Nations, in this regard.\r\nThe lessons learned in recent years have\r\nconfirmed that overcoming the consequences of\r\nterrorism and extremism is more difficult than their\r\ntimely prevention. Moreover, the aggressive drive of\r\nterrorists to acquire weapons of mass destruction has\r\nbecome a new reality. The international community\r\nshould confront these far-reaching plans using an\r\neffective and streamlined system of measures to\r\nprevent access by terrorists to arms, new technologies,\r\nand dual-use material.\r\nUzbekistan welcomes the progress made in the\r\ndevelopment of legal instruments aimed at combating\r\ninternational terrorism. Tangible results, however, can\r\nbe achieved only by creating a global system of\r\ncomprehensive cooperation. That is why we support\r\nthe work of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism\r\nCommittee. We are confident that the regional anti-\r\nterrorism centre of the Shanghai Cooperation\r\nOrganization, established to collaborate with other\r\nsimilar centres, will prove to be an important\r\ncomponent of the global anti-terrorist system.\r\nTo combat the threat of international terrorism\r\nand extremism, it is important to confront the hotbeds\r\nall over the world of extremism and the dissemination\r\nof the ideology of fanatical ideologies. Despite current\r\nmeasures to isolate them, these centres still possess\r\nsubstantial financial resources and the capacity to\r\ninfluence the hearts and minds of young people and\r\nmobilize them for their far-reaching objectives. In\r\naddition to the measures being implemented today, it\r\nwould be desirable to establish a special United\r\nNations programme to promote education and\r\nawareness among young people and develop in them a\r\nstrong aversion to extremist ideology.\r\nUzbekistan maintains that the United Nations can\r\nand must play a more significant role in resolving the\r\nmost urgent issues of today’s world. For this purpose,\r\nfirst and foremost, United Nations programmes must\r\nbecome more concrete and effective so that they can\r\nbetter target the real needs of regions. In this regard, I\r\nwould like to present the following views.\r\nFirst, Uzbekistan unequivocally supports further\r\ndevelopment of regional integration and considers the\r\nOrganization of Central Asian Cooperation (OCAC) as\r\na crucial mechanism of multilateral collaboration\r\namong the States of the region. We consider the\r\nOrganization’s economic component, as well as the\r\nestablishment of water, energy, transport and\r\ncommunication consortia within its framework, as a\r\npriority.\r\nThe need to overcome the isolation of the region\r\nin terms of transport and communication is of utmost\r\nimportance among the objectives vital for sustainable\r\ndevelopment of the Central Asian States. In this\r\ncontext, I would particularly like to draw Members’\r\nattention to the multilateral initiative to establish a\r\ntrans-Afghan transport corridor, which would provide\r\nlandlocked nations that encounter difficulties in\r\naccessing world markets with new access to seaports.\r\nUndoubtedly, the implementation of this project would\r\nboost trade and economic ties and fundamentally\r\nchange geopolitical and economic realities in the\r\nregion.\r\nWe believe it is high time for relevant United\r\nNations agencies, above all the United Nations\r\nDevelopment Programme, United Nations Industrial\r\nDevelopment Organization and the Economic and\r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, to develop\r\nprogrammes aimed at increasing the volume of aid to\r\n13\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nthe region’s States and Afghanistan for the purpose of\r\ndeveloping transport infrastructure and providing real\r\nsupport in communications projects.\r\nSecondly, Uzbekistan calls for strict compliance\r\nby all nations with a global nuclear non-proliferation\r\nregime. Today, in our view, the significance of the\r\ninitiative of Uzbekistan and other countries of the\r\nregion to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in\r\nCentral Asia has become paramount. We greatly\r\nappreciate the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi Annan,\r\nand the United Nations Department for Disarmament\r\nAffairs in supporting the expert group, which is\r\ncurrently working on a draft treaty.\r\nThe establishment of the zone is nearly complete,\r\nand, to legitimize it, Uzbekistan calls on all permanent\r\nSecurity Council members to develop a consolidated\r\nposition with the region’s States on the provisions of\r\nthe draft treaty and its protocol.\r\nThirdly, Central Asia is facing a wide-scale\r\nassault by international drug cartels, which are using\r\nthe destructive power of international terrorism to\r\nprotect drug routes. Under these conditions, there is a\r\nneed for concerted efforts and effective international\r\nprogrammes under the auspices of the United Nations\r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime.\r\nWe believe that the establishment in Tashkent of\r\nthe regional information and coordination centre to\r\ncombat transboundary crime, proposed by President\r\nIslam Karimov during the visit of Secretary-General to\r\nUzbekistan last October, could become a tangible\r\ncontribution by the United Nations. We count on the\r\nsupport of the United Nations and donor countries in\r\nmaking this initiative a reality.\r\nToday, the United Nations faces the need to adapt\r\nits mechanisms to the realities of the new world,\r\nwhich, we think, is dependent upon the prompt\r\ncompletion of the process of reform of the\r\nOrganization. There is an urgent need to reorganize the\r\nSecurity Council so that it reflects current realities. An\r\nexpanded Security Council should include both\r\ndeveloped and developing nations. We reiterate our call\r\nfor inclusion of Germany and Japan in the Security\r\nCouncil as permanent members.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that the\r\nprincipally new approaches taken by the United\r\nNations to the realities and prospects of Central Asia\r\nwill ultimately meet the fundamental interests of the\r\nentire world community. I am confident that this\r\nsession will give new momentum to the joint efforts of\r\nMember States to counter the threats and challenges of\r\nglobal and regional security.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency\r\nMr. Hor Namhong, Minister for Foreign Affairs and\r\nInternational Cooperation of the Kingdom of\r\nCambodia.\r\nMr. Hor Namhong (Cambodia): First of all, I\r\nwish to extend my warmest congratulations to you,\r\nMr. President, on your election as President of the\r\nfifty-eighth session of the General Assembly. I am\r\nconfident that, under your wise leadership, the work of\r\nthis great Assembly will further strengthen\r\ninternational cooperation and will thus contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of peace, stability and security in this\r\nglobalized world. The international environment today\r\nremains, no doubt, uncertain, as the world continues to\r\nconfront constant change and turbulence.\r\nOn the global stage, at least three key challenges\r\ncontinue to occupy the attention and remain a priority\r\nof the international community.\r\nThe first challenge is the global situation. First,\r\nthe current situation in Iraq is a serious predicament.\r\nWhile the war is over, the situation in the country\r\nremains critical. Peace, security and stability have not\r\nreturned to Iraq. Although the number of international\r\ncontingents deployed in Iraq has been increased, the\r\noverall environment in the country is very fragile and\r\nhighly unstable. I think that United Nations should\r\nassume a greater and more responsible role in returning\r\nnormalcy to the country during the transitional period.\r\nThe road to normalcy means that Iraq should be\r\nallowed to govern itself as early as possible, which can\r\nbe done in several ways, including the holding of free\r\nand fair elections.\r\nCambodia strongly condemns the criminal attack\r\nagainst the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on\r\n19 August, and it wishes to pay a tribute to all the\r\nvictims, especially to Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special\r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General. Let us pay our\r\nrespect to the memory of that great servant of peace.\r\nWe in Cambodia always remembers his noble actions\r\nin Cambodia in the early 1990s in the framework of the\r\nUnited Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia.\r\nSecondly, regarding the Middle East quagmire, it\r\nis important that all parties to the conflict, particularly\r\n14\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nPalestine and Israel, as well as the international\r\ncommunity, continue to pursue a peaceful solution to\r\nthe Middle East conflict on the basis of the agreed road\r\nmap of the Quartet. At the same time, I believe that it\r\nis vital for the leaders of both sides of this conflict to\r\nrenounce the cycle of violence and overcome feelings\r\nof animosity and myopic interest. Instead, they should\r\nconsider the broader collective interests of peaceful\r\ncoexistence, a peaceful life for their peoples and\r\nstability in the region. There is a need for all sides to\r\nhave a sense of political realism and shared\r\ndetermination to make peace possible.\r\nI believe that today peace in the Middle East will\r\ncome only when both Palestine and Israel reasonably\r\nrecognize in every way that they must coexist side by\r\nside, living in peace and harmony with each other and\r\nlooking after the interests of one another. Peace,\r\ntolerance and harmony are the only way forward for\r\nthe people of Palestine and Israel. In that regard, the\r\ninternational community must remain fully committed\r\nto continuing to support the Middle East process to its\r\nend.\r\nThirdly, terrorism is still a very serious threat to\r\nhumanity as a whole. Since the attacks of 11 September\r\nand the international reaction to fight terrorism,\r\nterrorists have been strengthening their worldwide\r\nnetworks. They also continue to kill innocent people\r\neverywhere in the world. In Asia and in South-East\r\nAsia, Jemaah Islamiah, which is linked to al Qaeda, has\r\nbeen responsible for a number of terrorist attacks in the\r\nregion. The Association of South-East Asian Nations\r\n(ASEAN) has been actively responding to terrorism by\r\nstrengthening cooperation at all levels, issuing various\r\nstatements and taking concrete measures. Nevertheless,\r\nJemaah Islamiah remains a significant threat to the\r\nregion today, despite the progress in anti-terrorism\r\naction thus far.\r\nFourthly, regarding global poverty, we recall the\r\nMillennium Summit held in New York and the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg,\r\nthe International Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment in Monterrey and the recent G-8 Summit\r\nin Evian, France, where the overriding theme was the\r\nfight against poverty, which calls for concerted efforts\r\nfor poverty alleviation and sustainable development.\r\nHowever, poverty remains a severe problem for the\r\nworld, particularly the developing countries, with 1.2\r\nbillion people still surviving on less than one dollar a\r\nday. Despite clear messages from all those summits,\r\nespecially from the developing countries, on the need\r\nto reduce poverty, the actions so far have not been\r\ndecisive enough.\r\nI believe that, without concrete measures and the\r\nprovision of adequate resources, it will be impossible\r\nfor the least developed countries to overcome the\r\ncurrent challenges of poverty, aggravated by the speed\r\nof globalization, which has contributed to the widening\r\ngap between the haves and the have-nots.\r\nFighting poverty is not the responsibility of the\r\nleast developed countries alone. It is the shared\r\nresponsibility of the international community, in which\r\nthe developed world has an important role to play.\r\nPoverty prevails today in many forms and dimensions.\r\nFor the developed countries to share resources with the\r\ndeveloping countries is not only an act of generosity, it\r\nis also a requirement for living together in a world of\r\npeace, security and harmony. In that regard, I am\r\nconvinced that the international community must act\r\ncollectively and in a spirit of responsibility and\r\nsolidarity to end this alarming situation of poverty by\r\ntaking concrete steps to reduce it gradually.\r\nThe second major challenge involves regional\r\ndevelopments. Regarding the regional situation, there\r\nhave been many developments. Some have been\r\npositive; others negative. I wish to note several\r\nimportant developments since last year. First, the\r\neighth ASEAN Summit and other related summits in\r\nPhnom Penh, Cambodia, have successfully advanced\r\nASEAN integration by moving the region ahead in\r\nterms of establishing the ASEAN Economic\r\nCommunity (AEC), deepening cooperation between\r\nASEAN and China, Japan and the Republic of Korea,\r\nand strengthening cooperation with India. With those\r\nfour countries, ASEAN has enhanced close and\r\nproactive cooperation among a combined population of\r\nmore than three billion people that has enormous\r\neconomic potential and opportunities for development\r\nand growth. In addition, during that ASEAN Summit,\r\nits leaders also held, for the first time, a summit\r\ndialogue with Africa through President Thabo Mbeki\r\nof South Africa, the current Chairman of the New\r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development, NEPAD.\r\nSecondly, the situation in the Korean peninsula\r\ncontinues to evolve and give rise to concerns for\r\ncountries that are directly involved. Cambodia fully\r\nsupports the peace talks in Beijing and believes that\r\nonly dialogue and compromise can provide the way out\r\n15\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nof the present quandary. Although a number of\r\noutstanding issues need to be mutually resolved, I think\r\nit is important for all the parties concerned to reduce\r\ntension by avoiding hostile actions that would escalate\r\nthe situation. I believe that one way of enabling the\r\nsituation on the Korean Peninsula to move ahead\r\npositively is to negotiate a road map for a nuclear-free\r\nand secure Korean Peninsula. I believe that, if such a\r\nplan could go ahead, steps towards the normalization of\r\nthe situation on the Korean Peninsula could be taken.\r\nThirdly, I would like to refer to recent\r\ndevelopments in Cambodia. The situation in Cambodia\r\nis continuing to improve significantly. The recent\r\nelections were held in a free, fair and democratic\r\nenvironment, as many international election observers\r\nnoted in their statements. This year’s election marks\r\nanother important milestone in Cambodia’s\r\ndemocratization, which has been strengthened at the\r\ngrass-roots level through the successful local elections\r\nto communal councils last year. At the same time,\r\nCambodia’s gross domestic product growth continues\r\nto show positive signs, with an approximate growth\r\nrate of 6.7 per cent per annum over the past five years,\r\ndespite natural calamities and the impact of other\r\nregional and global developments, such as terrorism\r\nand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.\r\nIn addition, the Government’s strategy gives top\r\npriority to poverty reduction. In March this year, the\r\nCambodian Prime Minister, Samdech Hun Sen,\r\nofficially launched the campaign for poverty\r\nalleviation aimed at reducing the poverty rate by 1.2\r\nper cent every year. By 2015, the poverty level would\r\nbe reduced to 19 per cent. In order to achieve that end,\r\na budget of $1.5 billion has been projected.\r\nThe third challenge is the reform of the United\r\nNations. Every year, representatives of every\r\ndelegation advocate to the Assembly the necessity of\r\nreforming the Organization, in particular the Security\r\nCouncil. I, too, believe that without sufficient reform in\r\nthis world body, the United Nations cannot be an\r\neffective and efficient global Organization that is able\r\nto respond collectively to the complex global\r\nchallenges affecting humanity in the twenty-first\r\ncentury. The world has witnessed a wave of democracy\r\nsince the end of the cold war more than a decade ago. I\r\nbelieve, however, that democratization needs to start\r\nright here at the United Nations, which should respect\r\nthe will of the community of nations. Any further\r\ninaction on the part of the United Nations with regard\r\nto the call for reform will mean a continuing decline in\r\nits credibility, as well as increasing loss of confidence\r\nin this universal institution.\r\nI believe that one of the key issues of United\r\nNations reform is the need for the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council. Cambodia calls once again for the\r\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council\r\nto include Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany and\r\nIndia as new permanent members, given the crucial\r\nrole of these three countries in international political\r\nand economic affairs today.\r\nMoreover, the General Assembly, as the highest\r\nbody of the United Nations, should play a more\r\nimportant role, in accordance with the Charter, for the\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nFurthermore, in the context of United Nations reform, I\r\nthink that we should look beyond the conventional\r\nagenda of international peace and security, given that\r\nthe glaring poverty in the world today is, without\r\ndoubt, a peace and security issue. I believe that the\r\nUnited Nations should play a more meaningful role,\r\nwithin the broad framework of human security, in the\r\nworld’s collective efforts to fight poverty.\r\nAs the world marches on, I believe that we must\r\nperhaps devise new ways to deal with a myriad of\r\nchallenges that menace the whole of humanity. We will\r\nhave to close the gap between the poor and the rich and\r\nbetween the developed and developing countries. We\r\nmust fight poverty and HIV/AIDS, which are affecting\r\nmillions of people in the developing countries. We\r\nneed to tackle together the growing impact of\r\ntransnational crime. At the same time, we must pay\r\ngreater attention to hotbeds of tension around the world\r\nin order to ensure a peaceful and secure world for all.\r\nFinally, we must continue to ensure that the\r\nUnited Nations is truly a democratic global institution\r\nthat reflects the reality of the world today. We need to\r\nadvance together in peace, security, stability,\r\ndevelopment and prosperity in building a better place\r\nfor all peoples on the Earth.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe the way forward for the\r\nworld will depend largely on international cooperation\r\nand the need to share global resources more equitably.\r\nGrowing interdependence and increasing globalization\r\nmean that every nation must work collectively in\r\naddressing the current challenges in the most effective\r\nway.\r\n16\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nThe President: I give the floor to His Excellency\r\nMr. Francisco Guerrero Prats, Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Guerrero Prats (Dominican Republic)\r\n(spoke in Spanish): The international community is\r\ncurrently going through a period of reflection and self-\r\ndefinition. The great transformations that humanity\r\nexperienced during the course of the previous decade,\r\nas well as current challenges, demand greater\r\nresponsibility on the part of our nations in playing an\r\nactive role in the search for urgent solutions to the\r\nproblems that are affecting us. This new session of the\r\nGeneral Assembly presents us with an excellent\r\nopportunity to achieve that goal.\r\nToday, the Dominican Republic reaffirms its\r\ncommitment to peace, the defence of human rights,\r\nsecurity, sustainable development and the\r\nstrengthening of democracy — pillars of indisputable\r\nimportance in safeguarding international peace and\r\nstability.\r\nThe issue of the reform of the United Nations has\r\nbeen on our agenda for a long time. Events of recent\r\nyears make it clear that this task must be undertaken as\r\na matter of priority. The reform the Security Council is\r\nparticularly urgent. Ever since the approval of\r\nresolution 47/62 of 11 December 1992, we have been\r\nengaged in an ongoing debate on the various reform\r\nproposals. Now, however, it is time to act to restructure\r\nthe Council so as to make it more representative and\r\nequitable, as well as more transparent in its decision-\r\nmaking, thereby strengthening its legitimacy as the\r\nguarantor of international peace and security.\r\nTerrorism has emerged as an ongoing threat to\r\nhumanity. Uncertainty and pain have characterized the\r\nbeginning of the twenty-first century. Our nations have\r\nthe challenge of fighting together, at a global level,\r\nagainst the proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction and in favour of equitable development and\r\nfree societies. Security problems call for decisive\r\naction against international terrorism, organized crime\r\nand the illegal trade in arms and drugs.\r\nThe Millennium Summit established as one of its\r\nmain goals the reduction of poverty by 50 per cent by\r\n2015. Notwithstanding some progress in the\r\nachievement of those goals, poverty remains a terrible\r\nscourge. The Dominican Government, which considers\r\nthat issue to be one of great importance, has created a\r\nSocial Cabinet to act as a coordinating mechanism for\r\nall governmental institutions for social welfare, and is\r\nhelping to ensure that both national and international\r\nresources are distributed equitably and allocated to\r\nregions that require social investment.\r\nAll countries must join efforts, accepting\r\nresponsibilities, both shared and separate, to guarantee\r\nthat growth and poverty do not go together and that, in\r\nmeeting the needs of the present generation, we do not\r\ncause the destruction of future generations’ capacity to\r\nmeet their own needs.\r\nThe positive outcome of the Fourth Ministerial\r\nConference of the World Trade Organization, held in\r\nDoha, Qatar, in November 2001, and of the\r\nInternational Conference on Financing for\r\nDevelopment held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March\r\n2002, was a key element for achieving millennium\r\ndevelopment goals. The Doha Development Agenda\r\nand the Monterrey Consensus provided a framework to\r\nfacilitate market access, improve multilateral\r\nregulations for channelling globalization and increase\r\nfinancial aid for development.\r\nHowever, we must mention what happened at the\r\nFifth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\r\nOrganization (WTO) recently held in Cancún, Mexico.\r\nAlthough agreement was not reached because of\r\nfundamental differences in the positions regarding\r\nessential world trade issues, we are convinced that this\r\nwill not affect the multilateral system of negotiations.\r\nOn the contrary, some member states maintain that this\r\nimpasse may even be necessary to shape more\r\nequitable international agreements at the heart of the\r\nWTO. What is an important issue is not to lose the\r\ndevelopment perspective within the work programme\r\nof the WTO, as set in the Doha Development Agenda,\r\nbecause that agenda includes the aspirations of millions\r\nof people around the world, whose hope for progress\r\nlies in the opportunities of the global economy.\r\nThe position of the Dominican Government with\r\nregard to the Middle East conflict is based primarily on\r\nunconditional adherence to the norms and principles of\r\ninternational law, particularly those related to the\r\npeaceful solution of disputes; condemning the use of\r\nforce and terrorism in all its forms; complying in good\r\nfaith with international treaties; and on strict\r\nobservance of resolutions of the United Nations and its\r\ndeliberative bodies.\r\nDevoted to these principles, the Dominican\r\nRepublic has, in response to the humanitarian appeals\r\n17\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nof the Security Council, participated in the efforts to\r\nrebuild Iraq, in order to contribute to the development\r\nof a secure and stable environment in which the\r\nsovereignty of the Iraqi people may be restored.\r\nSimilarly, our country supports the peace process\r\noutlined in the road map submitted by the United States\r\nof America and endorsed by the Russian Federation,\r\nthe United Nations and the European Union. We\r\nunderstand that a cessation of violence cannot be\r\npostponed, along with the historic pledges of all parties\r\nto make sacrifices to promote a lasting solution to the\r\nconflict and peaceful coexistence.\r\nDrawing up sustainable development policies\r\ncalls for dealing with problems before they emerge.\r\nThis implies making headway in achieving the\r\nmillennium development goals, particularly on crucial\r\nissues such as energy and protection of the\r\nenvironment. In this respect, our nation reiterates its\r\nrejection of the international maritime transport of\r\nradioactive and toxic waste, a position which has been\r\nexpressed in other international forums. This issue is\r\nlinked to international security.\r\nThe importance of guaranteeing women equal\r\nrights and equity, and promoting their increased\r\npolitical participation, has been a continuous concern\r\nof the heads of State in various international forums.\r\nThe International Research and Training Institute for\r\nthe Advancement of Women (INSTRAW), the only\r\ninstitution within the United Nations system dedicated\r\nexclusively to that end, has its headquarters in Santo\r\nDomingo, capital of the Dominican Republic. The\r\nDominican Government calls upon Member States to\r\ncontinue supporting the work of INSTRAW in the\r\nDominican Republic by providing contributions, to the\r\nextent that they can.\r\nOur country commends the culture of peace, and\r\nis making efforts to ensure that at the primary level\r\nchildren are taught about promoting mutual\r\nunderstanding and learn about civics and human rights.\r\nSimilarly, we believe that a solid and permanent\r\ndemocracy is an achievable goal. The challenges here\r\nare clear: growing democracy, more respect for civic\r\nrights, freedom of the press; freedom of expression of\r\npolitical parties and public opinion; dignity and\r\ntransparency of all leaders and the moral legitimacy of\r\nall.\r\nDeeply concerned about the spread of HIV/AIDS\r\nin our nation, the Government has made great efforts to\r\ncomply with the commitments entered into in the\r\nDeclaration on fighting this terrible disease. We call for\r\nincreased international cooperation and efforts to\r\nguarantee the availability of drugs at affordable prices,\r\nbased on the Doha Declaration on intellectual property\r\nand the right to health.\r\nThe Dominican Republic salutes with optimism\r\nthe role played by the United Nations and the\r\nOrganization of American States (OAS) in efforts to\r\ndevelop humanitarian aid programmes for the Haitian\r\npeople. It is imperative to stress here the need for\r\ngreater support from the international community for\r\nour neighbouring republic of Haiti and its neglected\r\npopulation.\r\nAlthough we are aware that this issue has been\r\nexcluded from the agenda of the current session , we\r\nwish to state our support for the aspirations of the\r\nRepublic of China, Taiwan, to rejoin this Organization,\r\nof which it was a Member for many years. Our position\r\nis in line with the universal principles contained in the\r\nCharter, the basis of the rules of international law and\r\nthe historical tradition of friendly relations with\r\nTaiwan.\r\nOn behalf of the Dominican Government, Sir,\r\nmay I congratulate you on your election as President,\r\nconfident that your conduct of this session will be\r\nsuccessful, beneficial for the international community\r\nand a source of pride to your country, Saint Lucia, and\r\nthus to our Caribbean community.\r\nI also wish to express the Dominican\r\nGovernment’s rejection of the barbaric act perpetrated\r\nagainst the United Nations Mission in Baghdad on 19\r\nAugust, and to reiterate to the families of Mr. Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello and of the other deceased colleagues\r\nour most heartfelt condolences.\r\nWe are all aware of the great challenges\r\nconfronting humanity. Our future depends on the\r\nactions we take now. We have the opportunity to meet\r\nthe expectations of the nations of the world. Let us take\r\nup this challenge with all due responsibility.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Mateus Meira Rita, Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs and Cooperation of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\n18\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nMr. Meira Rita (Sao Tome and Principe) (spoke\r\nin Portuguese, English text provided by the\r\ndelegation): I begin by joining previous speakers in\r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your election. My\r\nGovernment is deeply gratified by the recognition of\r\nyour accomplishments as someone from a country that\r\nis a member of the Small Island Developing States\r\nNetwork. We are confident you will lead the work of\r\nfifty-eighth session with the same abilities as your\r\ndistinguished predecessor, His Excellency Jan Kavan\r\nof the Czech Republic.\r\nOn behalf of the people of Sao Tome and\r\nPrincipe, I would like to reaffirm the principles of the\r\nCharter and its role in promoting peace and\r\ndevelopment, and to pay tribute to Secretary-General\r\nKofi Annan for his dedication and leadership.\r\nWe all face daunting challenges. Violence has\r\ninflamed international relations. On behalf of my\r\ncountry, I would like to express our outrage and regret\r\nthat the United Nations Mission in Baghdad was\r\nbrutally attacked, with the tragic loss of such\r\noutstanding United Nations professionals as Sergio\r\nVieira de Mello. We pay tribute to all those who died\r\ndefending the peaceful path to peace and development\r\nin Iraq.\r\nAs we all are aware, Africa, perhaps more than\r\nall the world’s continents, faces enormous challenges.\r\nWe are plagued by endemic diseases such as malaria,\r\nwhich debilitate and kill our people needlessly. HIV/\r\nAIDS is devastating Africa’s families, societies,\r\ncultures and economies. How can we have economic\r\ndevelopment when our people are too ill to work, or\r\nwhen the main breadwinner in the family is dying of\r\nHIV/AIDS, without any medical treatment?\r\nOur economy has begun to feel the negative\r\neffects of these two deadly diseases. We urge all\r\nnations to work together to mobilize the necessary\r\nhuman and financial resources for the critical task of\r\ncontrolling these epidemics, which give rise to an\r\nunrelenting cycle of death and suffering for our\r\npeoples. There can be no hope for progress in Africa if\r\nbasic health is not first ensured, so that the people can\r\nwork and build their own prosperity.\r\nSao Tome and Principe, a small island State with\r\na fragile economy, is struggling. We are proud of our\r\ndemocracy, our free and fair elections, our human\r\nrights and our rule of law. But in July of this year our\r\nproud and stable democracy came under threat from\r\nforces seeking to topple our constitutionally elected\r\nGovernment. They did not succeed, because the\r\ninternational community quickly intervened to support\r\nour elected authorities and to negotiate a peaceful end\r\nto the coup attempt, which restored our constitutional\r\nGovernment. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nthank Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his personal\r\nconcern for our country’s well-being. I wish also to\r\nexpress my appreciation for the support of the African\r\nUnion, led by President Chissano of Mozambique, and\r\nfor the tireless assistance of President Obasanjo of\r\nNigeria, as well as that of officials from Portugal,\r\nBrazil, the United States, Angola, Gabon, Cape Verde\r\nand the Congo, and the many others who rescued our\r\ndemocracy from peril.\r\nBut our democracy will remain under threat\r\nunless the Government can mobilize resources\r\nsufficient to provide basic services to our long-\r\nsuffering people. For this reason, the people and the\r\nGovernment of Sao Tome and Principe ask for\r\ncontinued international support, with development aid,\r\nto improve the lot of our people and to ensure the\r\nsurvival of our young democracy.\r\nWe must all work together to strengthen\r\nmultilateral cooperation and to ensure that the United\r\nNations and all its agencies continue to be the forum in\r\nwhich all Member States can promote dialogue and\r\nensure world peace, security, democracy and\r\ndevelopment.\r\nMy country regrets that international relations in\r\nsome parts of the world have deteriorated to the point\r\nwhere extreme violence is the daily norm,\r\ninfrastructures have been destroyed, and human rights\r\nare daily violated. We lament the plight of the refugees\r\nthat this violence creates, and especially the plight of\r\nchildren, who often become the victims of those who\r\ntraffic in human beings.\r\nThe tragedies in Iraq, the Middle East, Liberia\r\nand Afghanistan — to name only the most egregious —\r\ncan be overcome only within the multilateral\r\nframework of United Nations. Unilateral actions are\r\ndoomed to failure in the long run.\r\nAt the same time, Sao Tome and Principe\r\nsupports an urgent reform of the Security Council, to\r\nmake it into a body that reflects current realities and\r\nnot those of the cold-war era. The Security Council\r\nmust be democratised, with the expansion of the\r\ncategory of permanent members.\r\n19\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nWe observe with great concern the spread of\r\nterrorist acts across the globe, ranging from tragic\r\nexamples such as what happened at Bali in Asia, to\r\nPalestine and Israel in the Middle East, to Spain and\r\nthe United Kingdom in Europe, to Kenya and Tanzania\r\nin Africa, to Colombia in Latin America, and right here\r\nto New York and other sites in North America. But\r\nfighting violence with violence is not enough. We must\r\ngo to the root of the problem, and that is the task of the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe world is a less secure place today than it was\r\na year ago. The proliferation of weapons of mass\r\ndestruction continues, non-proliferation treaties\r\nnotwithstanding. We must ensure the universality of\r\nthose treaties and compliance with them under the\r\nauthority of the Security Council.\r\nSao Tome and Principe strongly supports the\r\nMillennium Development Goals, but much remains to\r\nbe accomplished. The rules of the international\r\neconomy continue to be dictated by a small number of\r\ncountries that promote free markets while closing their\r\nown. The latest World Trade Organization meeting in\r\nCancún is the natural result of this hypocrisy.\r\nDeveloping economies like that of my country can be\r\ncompetitive only if there is a level playing field, if all\r\nmarkets are open and if subsidies and protectionism are\r\nerased.\r\nAs an island nation, Sao Tome and Principe\r\ncontinues to see its very existence threatened by global\r\nwarming. Our shorelines are eroding and our national\r\nterritory is shrinking as the seas rise. Is my small\r\ncountry to end up as nothing but a tiny volcanic peak\r\nsticking up above the waves, with the last of our people\r\nclinging to the land left unclaimed by the rising sea?\r\nThe Kyoto Protocol must be implemented by all for the\r\nbenefit of all.\r\nFor many years, the people of Cuba have been\r\nliving under an unjustifiable economic embargo. That\r\neconomic embargo is hampering development, and\r\npeople’s lives would improve were it to end. The time\r\nhas come for both sides to improve confidence-\r\nbuilding measures by going back to the negotiating\r\ntable and normalizing relations.\r\nMr. President, my country would once again ask\r\nfor your attention with respect to the Republic of China\r\non Taiwan. This is a country with a democratically\r\nelected Government which has built a strong economy\r\nand which has strong ties with many Member States.\r\nTaiwan was recently affected by Severe Acute\r\nRespiratory Syndrome (SARS), but it was beyond the\r\nreach of the World Health Organization because\r\nTaiwan is not allowed to be a member — simply\r\nbecause Taiwan’s people do not accept the imposition\r\nof the “one China” principle.\r\nDespite its small size, Taiwan offers development\r\naid to a large number of countries. Taiwan also\r\ncontributes to international security by being a strong\r\nproponent of the fight against terrorism.\r\nI wish to call to the attention of the Assembly\r\nthat, under the universality rules set out in the Charter\r\nof the United Nations, the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan must one day be here among us.\r\nOur goal is to leave a better world for the next\r\ngeneration. We cannot go along with the concept of\r\nusing force in international relations, and we denounce\r\nhuman injustice.\r\nWe decry environmental degradation, which\r\nultimately threatens us all. Sao Tome and Principe\r\nurges dialogue, tolerance and mutual understanding on\r\nthe part of all Member States. We ask all to respect the\r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency The\r\nHonourable Henry Chimunthu Banda, M.P., Deputy\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International\r\nCooperation of the Republic of Malawi.\r\nMr. Chimunthu Banda (Malawi): First of all,\r\nSir, allow me to congratulate you on your election as\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession and also to commend Mr. Jan Kavan for his\r\noutstanding and astute leadership in presiding over the\r\nfifty-seventh session. I should like also to commend\r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for his dynamism and\r\nfor the great leadership qualities he continues to\r\ndisplay in steering the affairs of the United Nations. I\r\nwish to assure you of Malawi’s continued support and\r\ncooperation as we deal with the challenges before us.\r\nI would like to express Malawi’s sincere\r\ncondolences to the families of the victims of the\r\nsenseless and barbaric attack against the headquarters\r\nof the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq,\r\nwhich resulted in the loss of a number of lives,\r\nincluding that of the Special Representative of the\r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. The\r\nattack should serve as a warning of our need to remain\r\nfocused on the fight against terrorism to ensure that the\r\n20\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nwar against that scourge proceeds as a multilateral\r\nundertaking. We fully support the call for all those\r\nresponsible for such attacks to be charged with war\r\ncrimes.\r\nTime has demonstrated the cardinal place of\r\nmultilateral approaches to international issues and\r\nproblems. The Iraq situation has revealed to us all in\r\nthe international community the importance of\r\nmultilateralism under the auspices of the United\r\nNations, whose central role in addressing international\r\nconflicts should not be undermined.\r\nLet me seize this opportunity to express, on\r\nbehalf of the Government and the people of Malawi,\r\nmy gratitude to the United Nations and its agencies, as\r\nwell as to other multilateral and bilateral donors, for\r\nthe emergency relief assistance given to Malawi and to\r\nother countries of southern Africa during the past two\r\nyears, when our people faced a critical food shortage\r\nthat threatened millions of lives. Their timely\r\nintervention enabled us to prevent a massive loss of\r\nlife. We trust that the international community will also\r\nassist us in improving our agricultural production so as\r\nto prevent the recurrence of famine.\r\nAfrica continues to experience the effects of the\r\ntragedy created by the HIV/AIDS scourge. Our\r\nnational budgets are seriously overstretched by the\r\ndemands of care, treatment, support and funerals for\r\nHIV/AIDS victims, which occur on an hourly basis in\r\nan environment of devastating economic decline and\r\nfamine. We are losing able-bodied people and\r\nprofessional expertise in all the sectors of our society\r\ntwo and a half times faster than we can replace them.\r\nWe are grappling with the problem of caring for tens of\r\nthousands of orphans, whose numbers are increasing at\r\nan alarming rate.\r\nThe bleak and desperate situation created by HIV/\r\nAIDS urgently calls for concerted and practical\r\ninternational action to implement the Millennium\r\nDeclaration and Development Goals in the fight against\r\nthis pandemic. I would like to thank all those partners\r\nthat continue to assist us in addressing this serious\r\nproblem.\r\nMalawi has paid close attention to the new\r\ninternational debate presently taking shape which\r\nadvocates a qualitative paradigm shift from policy\r\nframeworks and mere commitments in conferences to\r\nthe concrete implementation of an agreed action\r\nprogramme, or what has become known as the New\r\nMultilateralism which aims at addressing the serious\r\nshortcomings of existing multilateral policy\r\nprescriptions. The debate also seeks to effect a move in\r\nthe right direction. My Government supports this\r\nimportant innovation and, especially, the newly-\r\nlaunched United Nations system wide integrated\r\nframework for least developed countries, jointly\r\nworked out by the six core agencies and designed to\r\nfacilitate the effective integration of the least\r\ndeveloped economies into the multilateral trading\r\nsystem.\r\nWe also support the United Nations Development\r\nAssistance Framework (UNDAF) mechanism for\r\neffecting increased coordination and collaboration at\r\nthe national level in the preparation of development\r\nplans and programmes. We are keen to see a better-\r\ncoordinated and integrated follow-up to, and\r\nimplementation of, not only conference outcomes but\r\nalso outstanding donor commitments to our\r\ndevelopment efforts.\r\nIn the same vein, the Government of Malawi fully\r\nendorses the current exercise designed to reform the\r\nUnited Nations. A more representative and democratic\r\nUnited Nations will enhance the efficiency and\r\ncredibility of this world organization.\r\nI cannot overemphasize the centrality of market\r\naccess and trade to the whole question of poverty\r\neradication, sustainable agriculture and rural\r\ndevelopment. We need to translate the debate on\r\nWestern protectionism into a deliberate, broad-ranging\r\nglobal policy against trade barriers. Malawi is\r\nconcerned at the collapse of the recent World Trade\r\nOrganization meeting in Cancún, Mexico. We can only\r\nhope that the stalemate in the talks is only temporary.\r\nIn the current unbalanced system of trade, low\r\ncommodity prices on the international market have\r\nallowed a virtual free flow of our primary products to\r\nthe West with a near-zero return on our agricultural\r\nsector, making it all the more difficult to develop the\r\nsector into a key catalyst for rural and sustainable\r\ndevelopment as a strategy for effective poverty\r\nreduction.\r\nThe world today is faced with multiple\r\nchallenges, which have tested the resilience of the\r\nstrong, as well as that of the weak. In Africa, the noble\r\nobjectives of the New Partnership for Africa’s\r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), geared towards enabling.\r\nAfricans themselves to assume full responsibility for\r\n21\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\ndevelopment challenges, can be meaningfully realised\r\nonly with the support of the developed countries. So\r\nfar, not much has been achieved owing to resource\r\nconstraints. The resource pledges made by the Group\r\nof Eight at meetings in Canada and France must be\r\nhonoured in order for the implementation of the\r\nNEPAD programmes to pull Africa out of economic\r\nstagnation.\r\nWe were heartened by the launch, early this year,\r\nof the road map for a Middle East peace with the\r\nexpectation that it had established conditions for an\r\nirreversible transition to the establishment of an\r\nindependent Palestinian State co-existing with the State\r\nof Israel. It is, therefore, regrettable that the road map\r\nis being frustrated by elements that do not wish to see\r\npeace take root in the Middle East. We call upon the\r\nMiddle East Quartet and the Israeli and the Palestinian\r\nsides, in particular, to remain committed to the road\r\nmap and to do everything in their power to make it\r\nsucceed.\r\nI would like to commend the Secretary-General,\r\njointly with the Assembly and the Security Council, for\r\nhaving taken a number of decisive steps towards the\r\nresolution of conflicts in Africa, including through the\r\nframework of the open-ended ad hoc Committee. of the\r\nSecurity Council on conflict prevention and recovery in\r\nAfrica. Malawi reaffirms its alignment with the\r\nposition of Africa and the Southern African\r\nDevelopment Community on preventive diplomacy,\r\nand commends, in this regard, the General Assembly\r\nwork on a draft resolution on the prevention of armed\r\nconflict in Africa. We also support the Economic and\r\nSocial Council resolution establishing an Ad Hoc\r\nAdvisory Group for mobilizing assistance for African\r\ncountries emerging from conflict.\r\nThe humanitarian tragedies in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau,\r\nSierra Leone and Liberia remain a serious distraction\r\nfrom important national and regional development\r\ninitiatives.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the peaceful handover\r\nof the reigns of power in Burundi on 30 April, 2003, in\r\naccordance with the terms of the peace accord of\r\nAugust 2000. We also commend the successful\r\nestablishment and launching of a broad-based\r\nGovernment of national unity in the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo on 15 July 2003 and the\r\npeaceful and successful elections recently held in\r\nRwanda. However, it is important that war crimes\r\ncommitted in conflict areas be thoroughly investigated\r\nso that justice may take its course. This would help to\r\ncheck impunity, a phenomenon of most conflict\r\nsituations. In this connection, my Government\r\nwelcomes the announcement, on 16 July 2003, by the\r\nChief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court of\r\nplans to investigate war crimes committed in the region\r\nof Ituri in the north-eastern part of the Democratic\r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMalawi believes that the United Nations can\r\nmeaningfully advance the principles upon which it was\r\nfounded and effectively deal with the multiple\r\nchallenges that the global community is facing by\r\ntaking an all-inclusive approach to its membership. It is\r\nin this spirit that my country has, time and again, called\r\nfor the participation of the Republic of China in the\r\naffairs of this Organization in line with the principle of\r\nuniversality. Taiwan has a lot to offer in the promotion\r\nof the global common good, which the United Nations\r\nis here to advance. I therefore hope that the 23 million\r\npeople of Taiwan will be given sympathetic\r\nconsideration so that they may, once again, enjoy the\r\nright to associate with the world community through\r\nthis Organization.\r\nNext year will be an important one for the people\r\nof Malawi, as we will be holding the third general\r\nelection of the democratic dispensation ushered in\r\n1994. The elections will be tripartite, as they will\r\ninclude presidential, parliamentary and local\r\ngovernment elections. The elections could not have\r\nbeen scheduled to take place at a worse time, given that\r\nthe country has recently experienced a serious food\r\nshortage that has further strained the few resources\r\navailable to it. However, in response to the demands of\r\nthe country’s constitution, the Government and the\r\npeople of Malawi remain committed to fulfilling this\r\nconstitutional requirement for good governance based\r\non free and fair elections. Malawi seeks the\r\ncooperation, support and assistance of the international\r\ncommunity to facilitate the entire electoral process.\r\nMay I conclude by conveying to you,\r\nMr. President, to the Secretary-General and, indeed, to\r\nthe United Nations family, the profound gratitude and\r\nappreciation of His Excellency President Bakili Muluzi\r\nand the people of Malawi for the support and\r\ncooperation extended to the President and his\r\nGovernment since they assumed power in 1994. As\r\nPresident Muluzi prepares to retire next year, after\r\n22\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nserving the people of Malawi as President for two\r\nconsecutive five-year terms, he is confident that the\r\nUnited Nations and, indeed, the international\r\ncommunity at large, will remain committed to assisting\r\nthe new leadership and the people of Malawi in their\r\nquest for meaningful and effective socio-economic and\r\npolitical development.\r\nThe President: I now give the floor to His\r\nExcellency Mr. Alfred Capelle, chairman of the\r\ndelegation of the Marshall Islands.\r\nMr. Capelle (Marshall Islands): I am honoured to\r\naddress the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth\r\nsession, on behalf of His Excellency President Kessai\r\nH. Note and the people of the Republic of the Marshall\r\nIslands.\r\nAllow me to extend my sincere congratulations to\r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to your high\r\noffice. At the outset, I would like to take this\r\nopportunity to express our deepest condolences to the\r\nbereaved families that lost loved ones in the recent\r\nbombing attack on the United Nations offices in\r\nBaghdad. That tragic event was also a great loss to the\r\ninternational community. Such horrific acts of\r\nterrorism are utterly condemnable, and those\r\nresponsible should be swiftly brought to justice.\r\nMy delegation is especially pleased that this\r\nsession of the General Assembly will be presided over\r\nby the representative of a fellow member of the\r\nAlliance of Small Island States, and we wish you well,\r\nSir, in your endeavours throughout the session. We are\r\nhopeful that your presidency will help to highlight the\r\nspecial needs of small island developing States. It has\r\nlong been recognized that such States suffer particular\r\ndisadvantages in terms of both environment and\r\ndevelopment. This was recently reaffirmed by the\r\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, which\r\ncalled for a full and comprehensive review of the\r\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States.\r\nThe coming year will be a particularly important\r\none for the Marshall Islands and for all small island\r\ndeveloping States as we prepare for the 2004\r\nInternational Meeting in Mauritius to review the\r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action.\r\nIn preparation for that Meeting, the Marshall Islands is\r\ncurrently completing an assessment of the\r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action at the\r\nnational level. I would like to take this opportunity to\r\nencourage the international donor and development\r\ncommunity to engage with the small island developing\r\nStates in the preparatory process and to actively\r\nparticipate in the International Meeting so that it can\r\nproduce successful and practical outcomes for all such\r\nStates.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is faced with challenges\r\nshared by many small island States. Our land\r\ncomprises small, scattered islands and atolls, spread\r\nover vast areas of ocean. Our unique environment is\r\nfragile and highly vulnerable to the threats posed by\r\nglobal warming and environmental pollution and\r\ndegradation. Our natural resource base is extremely\r\nnarrow, our economy very small and we are\r\ndisadvantaged by our remoteness from world markets.\r\nGiven these factors, in our interactions within the\r\ninternational community, the Marshall Islands is\r\nparticularly concerned about the following issues. The\r\nfirst issue is sustainable development. Pursuing the\r\nthree pillars of sustainable development — economic,\r\nsocial and environmental — poses many challenges for\r\nsmall island States. During last year’s general debate,\r\nwe introduced our national blueprint for sustainable\r\ndevelopment. This document forms the basis of our\r\nlong-term sustainable development plans, which we are\r\ncurrently working hard to implement.\r\nIn this context, and in the follow-up to the World\r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, we continue to\r\nseek opportunities to form partnerships that will assist\r\nus in the practical implementation of projects under the\r\nPacific’s 14 Type II Umbrella Initiatives. Areas of\r\nparticular importance for our people include the need\r\nfor greater access to fresh water, the availability of\r\naffordable, renewable and environmentally sound\r\nenergy sources and the development of waste\r\nmanagement systems that minimize hazardous impacts\r\non society and the environment.\r\nAlso in this regard, we welcome the new work\r\nprogramme of the Commission on Sustainable\r\nDevelopment. We are particularly pleased that small\r\nisland developing countries will be considered as a\r\ncross-cutting issue in relation to the themes of each\r\ntwo-year work cycle, and that the theme of the 2014-\r\n2015 work cycle will focus on small island developing\r\nStates issues.\r\nOur second main area of concern is the\r\nenvironment, and in particular the threats posed by\r\nglobal climate change and sea level rise. These threats\r\n23\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nare felt most acutely by low-lying island and atoll\r\ncountries such as the Marshall Islands and many of our\r\nPacific neighbours.\r\nI am pleased to announce that the Marshall\r\nIslands has recently completed its ratification process\r\nfor the Kyoto Protocol. I take this opportunity to\r\ncommend those States that have ratified the Protocol,\r\nand I urge remaining States to do so without delay.\r\nThis matter is surely the most urgent facing the\r\ninternational community today. If we fail to act now,\r\nthe future will see the complete disappearance of many\r\nsmall island nations.\r\nIn relation to environmental matters, the Marshall\r\nIslands is particularly concerned about the state of the\r\nworld’s oceans and fisheries. As a nation whose very\r\nlivelihood depends on the resources of the sea, the\r\nMarshall Islands Government reaffirms its unwavering\r\nsupport for the regime established under the United\r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I am also\r\npleased to state that the Marshall Islands is now a party\r\nto the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.\r\nThe Marshall Islands is seriously concerned about\r\ninstances of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing\r\nwithin its exclusive economic zone. Such fishing\r\ngravely undermines the livelihood of our people that\r\ndepend on these resources as their primary means of\r\nsurvival. Regional and international cooperation must\r\nfocus on addressing this issue.\r\nWithin our region, we are pleased to note the\r\nrecent progress of the Convention on the Conservation\r\nand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in\r\nthe Western and Central Pacific Ocean. We are also\r\nparticularly pleased with the development of the\r\nPacific Islands Regional Ocean Policy and we look\r\nforward to broad participation in the upcoming Pacific\r\nIslands Regional Ocean Forum.\r\nAn ongoing issue of major concern for the\r\nMarshall Islands is that of nuclear weapons testing.\r\nThe people and the environment of the Marshall\r\nIslands continue to suffer as a consequence of the\r\nnuclear weapons tests that were conducted in our\r\nterritory between 1946 and 1958.\r\nAs we continue to seek resolution of this issue\r\nour people continue to suffer from ongoing health\r\neffects, the food chain still contains dangerously high\r\nradiation levels and our development capacity is\r\nrestrained by an inability to use contaminated islands\r\nand atolls.\r\nI have briefly addressed a few issues of major\r\nconcern to the Marshall Islands. There are, of course,\r\nmany other significant issues to be addressed during\r\nthe upcoming session.\r\nOne of the most important challenges facing the\r\ninternational community is the need for a\r\ncomprehensive, unified response to combat acts of\r\ninternational terrorism. I am pleased to be able to say\r\nthat the Marshall Islands has ratified all 12 of the core\r\nConventions against terrorism. We are continually\r\nworking to implement the provisions of Security\r\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), and we have taken\r\nmany steps at the national level to combat money\r\nlaundering and terrorist financing. We reiterate our\r\nsolidarity with all Member States that are working to\r\neliminate terrorism in all its forms.\r\nAnother important issue facing this body is the\r\ncontinued exclusion of the Republic of China on\r\nTaiwan from the United Nations. The Marshall Islands\r\nGovernment reiterates its concern that the exclusion of\r\na nation of peaceful and law-abiding citizens is not\r\nconsistent with the inclusive ideal of the United\r\nNations. I therefore strongly urge every Member State\r\nto reconsider this matter.\r\nThe Marshall Islands welcomes the progress\r\nachieved by the International Criminal Court over the\r\npast year. Many positive developments have taken\r\nplace, not the least of these being the election of a\r\nprominent panel of judges and the chief prosecutor. We\r\nlook forward to the Court becoming fully operational\r\nand we are confident that the Court will prove to be a\r\nvaluable mechanism in the administration of justice at\r\nthe international level.\r\nFinally, in terms of the need for further United\r\nNations reform, the Marshall Islands Government\r\nwishes to reiterate its support for the expansion of the\r\nSecurity Council. We believe that the number of both\r\npermanent and non-permanent members should be\r\nincreased, and that such expansion should include\r\nmembers from both developed and developing\r\ncountries. This expansion is urgently needed to\r\nincrease the representative base of the Council and to\r\nenhance its legitimacy in the light of the geographic\r\nand political realities of the world today. We also wish\r\nto emphasize the need for further streamlining of the\r\nwork of the General Assembly and its six Main\r\n24\r\nA/58/PV.18\r\nCommittees in order to enhance the efficiency and\r\neffectiveness of the Organization.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.\r\n"
